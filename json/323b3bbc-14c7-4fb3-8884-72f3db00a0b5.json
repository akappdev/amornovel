The dank, night air crept in through her thin sweater. She wrapped her arms around herself and tried to keep up with his pace. She rounded the corner, staying across the street from him. She tried not to let him get too far ahead of her. His outdated pleather jacket made it easy to keep him in her sights. No one but an immortal would be wearing pleather. She never would have noticed it before, but diversions were a necessity and fashion seemed like a reasonable one.</p><p>He turned down a dark alley. She grimaced and wondered if perhaps he looked for his next victim. He never looked behind himself. He was overconfident. They always were. His kind always believed they were the strongest animals in the urban jungle. His instincts lied to him and allowed for a false sense of security. He just didn't know it yet.</p><p>She fingered the platinum ring on her right middle finger with her thumb. The small band had a thin red line running through the middle of it. On the under side of the ring, sat a red rose. The ring was her mark. It was her badge. It permitted her to follow the man. It made her brand of deadly force acceptable.</p> <p>She winked her right eye, flashing in front of him.</p><p>She lifted him into the air, before he had a chance to change into a worthy adversary. She gasped when her bare hands made contact with the warm, fleshy meat of his throat and the spark started to fill her. The touch of his skin made every moment magnify, as her senses heightened from the feast. He choked and fought, but it was useless.</p><p>His eyes shot to the ring on her finger, and recognition and fear spread across his face.</p><p>\"You're a Rose.\"</p><p>His last words.</p> <p>Eager for her meal, she shivered in anticipation. The satisfaction filled her like a rich chocolate bar, melting into her taste buds. It sent chills through her arms, where the fire soothed her hunger.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d A man's voice echoed through the alley.</p><p>The spark of the fire died, taking her meal with it.</p><p>She dropped the dead man to the cold ground and the tingle stopped. She didn\u2019t like ending her meal that way. She licked her lips, wondering if her eyes still glowed like molten steel from her feast. She looked down the alley to where a policeman stood with his gun drawn. She observed the way his hands shook with the sizable gun in them. She smirked, knowing it was from lack of confidence. He was clearly new to the force. She knew the feeling.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are.\u201d His voice never wavered, but she could sense the fear coming off him. It was a scent that rode on the wind, as if searching out her nose. His voice was familiar.</p><p>Panic filled her. She knew him.</p> <p>He squinted, no doubt from the confusion of her still-glowing eyes and the possibility that he recognized her too.</p><p>She smiled, raising her hands. \u201cRun his prints and you\u2019ll thank me.\u201d He wasn\u2019t an innocent. The Roses did have rules about that sort of thing.</p><p>He walked toward her cautiously as he assessed the alley and the danger. \u201cGet down on the ground.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cReally, would you lie on this street? This alley is filthy with germs and God only knows what else.\u201d</p><p>A gust of wind blew past him, bringing with it a scent of laundry soap and deodorant with a subtle mix of windblown sea air. She would know that smell anywhere. She looked around for an exit beyond her usual one. She couldn't just vanish in front of him.</p><p>His smell was the soundtrack to her youth and innocence. His was the only true love she had ever known.</p><p>His face started to light up as his feet brought him closer. She felt the air suck from her body as he stood under the lone streetlight in the alley, which clearly the city's budget had forgotten.</p><p>She gulped, pushing down her feelings. She felt frozen in panic, but also desperate to see him. Just one glance of him would fill her for the next hundred years.</p> <p>He looked at her and frowned in disbelief, as he drew close enough to fully recognize her. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re the one? That's not possible.\u201d</p><p>She could see the raw emotion on his face. His lower lip trembled, no doubt followed by his entire body.</p><p>She took a step back, putting her hands out. \u201cJust pretend you never saw me. The medics will say heart attack.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, not you.\u201d His face twisted in pain. \u201cAnyone but you. Why?\u201d</p><p>She blinked as she remembered every second of their time together. She crammed it into a memory slot.</p><p>Every touch.</p><p>Every smile.</p><p>They had become her playlist when the burn in her chest grew unbearable. Only those little moments could sooth her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t avoid the sharp breath that left her mouth. She winced as she turned her heart off, and let the flat words leave her lips. \u201cI have to eat\u2014they make sense.\u201d</p><p>He looked sickened. \u201cYou\u2019re eating them? How? They have no marks. None of the others had marks.\u201d</p><p>She let the moment of shame fill her. She deserved to suffer.</p><p>She wanted to explain. She wanted to be that girl\u2014his girl. She wanted to be sitting on the back steps of his house, listening to his dreams. Instead she turned, jumping onto the handrail of the stairs next to her, and climbed the fire escape.</p><p>She ran up the stairs before he could register she had left. She could still smell his fear, but it had switched. It was a different kind of fear. The kind that broke her already-tattered and abused heart. His fear of losing her again filled the air with his screams. She felt the tears rolling as she listened to him shout her name, but she never stopped. She ran to the top of the building, desperate to get away.</p><p>His screams filled the night. \"AIMEE!\"</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Love and drugs change everything.</p><p>Port Mackenzie 2010</p><p>\u201cAimee?\u201d</p><p>I looked up from my pages of scribbles, confused. Sometimes that happened. It was new.</p><p>I needed a moment to recognize, not only where I was, but also who spoke to me.</p><p>I had let my daydream take me again.</p><p>\u201cAimee?\u201d</p><p>I looked at the front of the class to find a nasty glare coming off Miss Simms, my English teacher. She was giving me the look she gave all the bad kids. I looked at the board behind her, trying to remember what we were doing.</p><p>Twelfth Night.</p><p>She tapped her toes and crossed her arms. \u201cAimee, what is the theme Shakespeare is trying to hide beneath the themes we easily see?\u201d She asked it as if she was trying to trick me. Like she forgot who I was.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cBeyond the obvious themes of the folly in ambition and the uncertainty of gender, Shakespeare, as he always did, liked to use the theme of love as a means to suffering\u2014as if it were a weapon. Twelfth Night is only one of many of his plays where this theme is present.\u201d</p><p>And there it was. The difference between the other spaced-out morons and me; I actually knew more than the teacher.</p><p>I might have scribbled. I might have gazed out the window. I might have gotten lost in a few moments of lonely daydreams, but no matter what, I actually did my work. Even if I didn\u2019t have the answer, it would be easy for me to make up one.</p><p>Miss Simms smirked. \u201cNice answer, but pay attention.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but continued my scribbled flower garden. I felt a gaze upon me.</p><p>My eyes darted to the right. The face staring at me took my breath away. He always took it away. His bright-blue eyes, sandy blond hair and sexy grin always made my heartbeat quicken. Even then, when my soul was filled with the nothingness I had become, I noticed him. I was certain my heart was covered by at least a mile of frost and snow. I didn\u2019t really know how he made it take notice of him.</p><p>He grinned, mocking me. \u201cNice answer.\u201d</p><p>I felt my face heat up under his scrutiny. Miss Simms rattled on about the themes I\u2019d given her. Her passion for Shakespeare was undeniable. She was single. Single female teachers should never teach English; this was my opinion.</p><p>My eyes refused to listen to me and stole another glance at him.</p><p>I surfaced when I saw him. He made the classroom grow brighter and the work less mundane. My own foolish grin crept across my lips as I stared back at him. His gaze had remained far too long.</p><p>Sometimes that happened. It was new.</p><p>I shook it off and refocused on my doodles.</p><p>I made myself forget that I had wanted him\u2014before, when I believed in love. Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, before the real world crashed down on me and destroyed all my happiness and hope. Back then, I had been a girl with a dream. I had dreamed about him asking me on a date. I had fumbled my words around him. I had gotten lost in sentences when he walked by me. I had even forgotten my name watching him.</p><p>He flicked something at me, pulling me from my spinster-like daze. I furrowed my brow.</p><p>\u201cI might need a tutor,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I smirked. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for you, Shane. Year's almost up.\u201d</p><p>A shy smile crossed his lips.</p><p>I bit my lip watching it.</p><p>That smile had once been my food.</p><p>The bell rang just as I opened my lips to ask him something humiliating and unrelated to tutoring. That happened a lot. It wasn't new, unfortunately.</p><p>Miss Simms shouted homework and other things at us, but I jumped up and grabbed my books. I fled from the class.</p><p>I hurried along to my locker. My hands fumbled with the cold metal lock. When I got it open, I stood inside the safety of the locker door. With my face shielded, I took deep breaths and shook my head. Arguments filled my head, convincing me of things I didn\u2019t honestly believe. Things like the fact that Shane had flirted with me.</p><p>\u201cAimee,\u201d his deep voice spoke from the other side of the metal locker door.</p><p>I panicked. I took my last deep breath and closed the locker. I smiled up at him, nervous of the small distance between our bodies. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Why had he followed me to my locker?</p><p>He took a step toward me. I backed up a step. He put a hand on my closed locker, taking another step closer, as if blocking my path. \u201cI was wondering if you were going to come to my party this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I'd heard him; I just didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>He looked down at me in a way I\u2019d never seen before. His eyes held emotion that stretched beyond the simple question he had asked. \u201cAimee, you haven\u2019t been to a party all year; it's senior year.\u201d His eyes grew serious. \u201cYou\u2019re going away to university, and who knows how long before we see each other again. You know, all of us. I just thought, you know . . . \u2018cause it's been a while since your mom and stuff.\u201d He regretted it as he said it. I could tell. That didn\u2019t stop the clenching feeling in my belly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stuttered, \u201cUh, uh, uh, n-no. Probably not coming, but thanks for the invite.\u201d I was lost in the conversation. I wanted to jump up and down and shout 'YES' to the whole student body. I wanted to go to his party. I wanted him to continue staring at me the way he was.</p><p>\"Please.\" His blue eyes sparkled.</p><p>I shook my head and turned away. I ran/walked as fast as I could. I needed space from him before I just grabbed his face and did what I'd always dreamed of. I would put my hands up into his hair and pull his soft-looking lips down on mine.</p> <p>My face was crimson. I needed a cold shower. Being around him had grown harder in the past month. I noticed him at every turn. He was always there.</p><p>Why did he want me to come to his party? I never went to parties. Mostly, because I never got invited. My sister's boyfriend inviting me didn\u2019t make me feel better about the invite. I didn\u2019t understand how they were together, but they were.</p><p>I shut my brain off before I spent my day thinking about him. It couldn\u2019t be helped; he was so sexy and sweet. He didn\u2019t belong with my sister; she didn\u2019t like him for the right reasons. She liked that he was popular and his life was filled with drama. She thrived on drama.</p><p>Gahh, I had to stop thinking about him.</p><p>I avoided my mom's spot and took the bus home. I didn\u2019t want her to see me crushing on my sister's boyfriend, even though my mom would have understood. She knew I had loved him since I had been old enough to understand boys and girls were a different species altogether.</p> <p>When I got home my dad was in his office, closed up tight. He had become a hermit. I wasn\u2019t certain how vacation and bereavement leave worked in the real world, but I assumed eight months of not even trying to show up to work was bad. I grabbed a yogurt and went to my room to study.</p><p>I fell asleep instead of studying.</p><p>The dream was the same every time. Fog covered my eyes, but I could hear the people around me panicking. I put my hands out, trying to reach out to them. No one took my hand. When the fog cleared I saw faces of people I didn\u2019t know. They were calling for me. They were crying out. Disaster had struck the city I was in, and I had a terrible feeling it was my fault. I heard someone calling and looked up to the sky full of debris. His face was there. I cried out to him and tried to get him to take my hand. He pulled away from me, horrified for some reason. I shouted his name repeatedly, but he wouldn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Aimee.\" I knew the soft voice. It was my mom who whispered to me.</p><p>I woke startled, feeling my own embrace and the beads of sweat that soaked me.</p><p>I had fallen asleep in my clothes again. I sat up for a moment and pulled my sweater off as the night\u2019s cool air brushed against me.</p> <p>I looked around dazed, expecting to see someone. I had been certain that voices had woken me. Perhaps it had been my mom trying to talk to me. I rolled on my back as I slipped off my jeans and pulled the blankets around me. The enveloping darkness was a warm comfort inside my bed.</p><p>I fell back to sleep and dreamed of him again. In the new dream I floated, staring at him with my parents and my sister. I was unable to float down to touch the ground or move at all. I floated in limbo, watching them.</p><p>The breakfast table the next morning felt grim as I contemplated my dreams. As usual, I remembered very little. I didn\u2019t have garden-variety teenage girl dreams anymore. Nothing about my life in eight months had been garden variety.</p><p>Tragedy had struck.</p><p>I felt myself get lost for an eternity within a second. I fought with myself as I remembered our family's worst moment.</p><p>My mom had died.</p><p>I spent a few minutes remembering the day she died. I had walked home from school the long way. I felt a warm wind hit me. It was a cool day. I looked around at the swaying trees and branches. A brief thought about it being the Santa Ana winds from California coming up the coast filled my mind. I shivered at exactly the same moment my cell phone rang.</p><p>Everything slowed.</p> <p>I pulled out my phone and answered.</p><p>My sister screamed into the phone.</p><p>My legs ceased to exist.</p><p>I crumpled on the side of the road.</p><p>My soul literally made an attempt at leaving me.</p><p>My chest felt as though it ripped into a million tiny shards.</p><p>I had actual physical pain paralyzing me. For the first time in my life, I felt my heart's exact location. Her death took my breath and my sanity, simultaneously. I sat on the cold concrete and rocked back and forth in an attempt to block myself from the truth.</p><p>I knew hope was taken from my world. At that moment, I didn\u2019t know just how large of a piece it was.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if I would ever recover.</p><p>I convinced myself I would be fine as long as I didn\u2019t leave that spot on the road. The spot where I'd felt the warm wind. No doubt it had been my mom brushing against me. It was her one last time to tell me how much I was loved. Of this, I was certain.</p><p>My father found me on the side of the road. He left the truck running in the middle of the street, and he ran to my side. He sat there with me, wrapped around me.</p><p>He had searched for me for hours. When he finally found me, I was devoid of every feeling. I knew if I acknowledged one pain, I would have to face the others.</p><p>I knew my father was touching me. I refused to feel him as he cried on my shoulder. He shook my body with his sobs. He tried to get me to stand, but I rejected his attempts.</p><p>I knew nothing was special about that place on the side of the road on the way home. If I left it, I would never again find it. It was the last place my mom had touched me, and I needed it.</p><p>I shivered at the memories and looked down at my mushy cereal.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like to think of such depressing thoughts before breakfast, but that morning seemed to feel worse than most days. I had been certain that I had started to come around, but the bad dreams hadn\u2019t helped.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Aimee! How does this look?\u201d</p><p>I looked up from my lost gaze to see my identical twin, except for hair and eyes, frowning at me. She posed as she modeled a pair of black leggings with huge grey boots and a silver sweater that hung off her left shoulder.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at yet another piece of silver clothing. I wondered where she got them all. I had a terrible feeling she was stealing them.</p><p>Alise, not Alice, has always been stunning. She had been beautiful at birth. Which sucked, because we were complete opposites. Where she had dark, black hair and silver eyes like our mom, I had blonde and blue. My eyes weren\u2019t even an attractive blue, more like grey. It was as if they tried to become silver like my sister's, but quit part way.</p><p>We shared every other feature, which seemed to work on her. On me, it looked uneven and plain. We were both five feet seven inches, one hundred and thirty-three pounds.</p><p>\u201cYou look fine. Why do you even care?\u201d I asked with a hint of disapproval, well, maybe not a hint.</p><p>Alise rolled her eyes and grabbed a banana. \u201cOh my God, Aimee. Mom isn\u2019t going to judge you for having some fashion sense.\"</p><p>I flinched at her saying the 'Mom' word, as if she was giving me motherly advice. Seeing the suffering on my face, she relented.</p><p>She tilted her head and continued in a less-harsh tone. It was more like patronizing, unless you were three-years old. \u201cShe\u2019s watching us from Heaven, and she\u2019s going to worry about you if you don\u2019t snap out of it. You\u2019re going to disappoint her by not living, not the opposite.\u201d</p><p>I gave her my best blank stare, which made her storm out the door to her car.</p><p>Alise's words stung. Not only did the double negative bother me, but I hated that she was right. Even though I knew it, I couldn\u2019t make myself move past what had occurred eight months prior. I felt the walls starting to close in around me as the air got heavy.</p><p>I ran up the stairs to my room and dove onto the carpet beside my bed. The carpet rubbed against my elbows.</p><p>In a panic, I fished the secret envelope out from under the bed.</p><p>Once the treasure was in my hands, I opened it slow and methodically.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to tear the plastic bag within the manila envelope. As always, I was careful when I opened it. I paused, letting it release its contents into the air. I held the plastic bag under my nose and let the fragrance fill my nostrils. The sweet smell that filled the air around me became my oxygen.</p><p>The walls started to come down a little, as if I was somewhere else. I was somewhere safe, where the smell of my mom made all the bad feelings small again.</p><p>\u201cYou existed, you loved me, you existed, you loved me,\u201d I chanted.</p><p>I was grateful the perfume had maintained its strength\u2014thanks to the protective plastic bag. My heart beat out of my chest, but I closed my eyes and let the world stop. I needed to feel her. Even if it was for a moment, she was there. I opened my eyes, relieved, and closed the bag, as always, being gentle with it. I put it back in the manila envelope and tucked it under my bed again.</p><p>I decided on the way back downstairs that I would visit my mom after school and see if I could just get a small feel of her again. Sometimes, being at the side of the road where I had been when my mom died made me feel her in the air. It was like a hug sent in a letter, where even though it wasn\u2019t real, the intent made you feel warm just the same.</p><p>Inpatient as always, Alise honked the horn of the car at me. My heart warmed to see my sister's glare through the windshield. She shouted at me but I ignored her. Instead, I took an extra-long unnecessary second to lock the house. It was small victories like that that got me through the day.</p><p>I never spoke to my sister about our mom. I wanted to. I wanted to tell her that being a little sad wouldn\u2019t kill her. Or tell her that acting like it had in fact impacted her life wouldn\u2019t make her look weak. If anything, it would make her seem more human.</p><p>I hated that she had seemed to cruise past our mom\u2019s death like nothing had happened. She cried a modest amount at the funeral on Saturday and shopped with friends on Monday. I had stayed in bed for two weeks. Well, until my father threatened calling my grandma to come help me through it. I resented his wanting to be the only one suffering.</p><p>I slumped into the seat of my sister's car. I turned away from her, watching the road blur by the window like an impressionist painting left out in the rain. Alise talked in a steady and unyielding stream on her Bluetooth. The whole ride was a series of 'OMG' and 'seriously' on both their parts. I often wondered if it was a modern-day Morse code. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Where I was shy and withdrawn, Alise had always been outgoing, or slutty, as the truly brave referred to her.</p><p>Our father, like myself, mourned alone in the quiet of his mind. He preferred to withdraw to his office, where he pretended to work. We knew he sat there surrounded by a million reminders of her. I tried not to judge him too harshly. I, too, had my own reminders of my mom, like the stolen nightgown and a few other key items. I had locked them away in Ziploc bags and smelled them like a serial killer. I had kept them under the bed for eight months without anyone seeing. I couldn\u2019t explain my need to smell them, even to myself. So I tried not to think about how creepy it was.</p><p>Alise blathered on with her friend Giselle while I watched out the window waiting for it to start feeling like a regular day again. In eight months, I hadn\u2019t been able to get that feeling back.</p> <p>\u201cOk girl, peace out.\u201d Alise looked at me as she clicked the phone off. \u201cCan you believe that? Jaime's going to freak when she hears that shit.\u201d</p><p>\"I don\u2019t like wasting the brain cells I have on Giselle or Jaime.\" I shrugged. I had no idea what she was talking about and I didn\u2019t care to know.</p><p>Alise groaned as we pulled into the school parking lot. \u201cAimee, if you don\u2019t try to be normal again, well, your nerdy normal anyway, they\u2019re going to lock you away for depression. It's going to be in one of those places where the girls don\u2019t shower and all become lesbians.\u201d</p><p>I stifled a laugh as she ranted.</p><p>\u201cLike a week ago, I heard Mrs. Sinclair talking to the guidance counselor about you. She said some shit about how they are noticing your inability to find happiness again or something like that. Dude, no one said you have to forget Mom, but you need to try to still be alive. Besides, it's embarrassing having the Emo-angst queen as my sister.\u201d</p> <p>I ignored her, and instead focused on the asylums full of unkempt lesbians around the country. It made me smile, even if it was just a tiny bit.</p><p>I crossed the courtyard from her car to my first class, knowing my body rejected her reasoning from head to toe. My greatest fear was becoming a happy kid again and forgetting how badly it hurt to lose my mom. Some days when I didn\u2019t fight it hard enough, I would catch myself distracted by something that made me smile. I knew it would be the end of my depression, sooner than later.</p><p>I coasted through my classes doodling, thinking about the dream I\u2019d had. It had been a repeat, I was certain. I remembered seeing the look on my father's face\u2014it had been fear.</p><p>I knew my dad was worried about me, but he wasn\u2019t one to be pointing fingers. He had been in a rough patch and hadn\u2019t come out of his office, except to ground Alise every other day. She swore up and down that she had caught him sitting in his walk-in closet under Mom's dresses and clothes. He sat there crying and touching the bottoms of them.</p><p>The bell rang for lunch before I realized I had even gone to a second period class. I looked down at the homework assignment I had written, amazed it was a coherent sentence. I picked up my books and slipped from the class, not making eye contact with anyone.</p><p>\u201cAimes, wait up,\u201d a voice called me from down the hall. It was a sound that warmed my heart. I turned to see Blake coming towards me. He was the only person who seemed to be able to see me past my sadness. I knew one day I would snap out of it and resurface because Blake still saw me. I was confident that if I ever got too lost in my pool of despair, he would reach his hand in and pull me out of it.</p> <p>I almost laughed as he stumbled up the stairs near my locker. He was not handsome in a traditional way. He was tall and thin, but not skinny. His blue eyes stood out against his dark hair. However, thick glasses and constant looking down muted the color of his eyes. He was always stuck in a book, iPhone, iTouch, or chess game.</p><p>It was rare for him to make eye contact with other people, except me. Being his best friend and the only person able to beat him in chess earned me at least a bit of eye contact. Well, me and Mr. Mac, our chem teacher, who held the chess club meetings.</p><p>\u201cHey, Blake.\u201d The words left my mouth in a low mutter. I thought for certain he hadn\u2019t been able to hear them.</p><p>He smiled at me, barely looking up from his iPhone. \u201cYou look like shit today, Aimee. Enough with the black already.\u201d</p><p>He was the only person who could be mean to me and make a smile cross my lips.</p><p>\u201cI like black.\u201d I tried to be serious. I closed my locker and we started to walk.</p><p>He shook his head, as he looked me straight in the eyes. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t, and you're starting to look like one of the Goths. It\u2019s hard to hang in the nerd crowd when you scare the nerds. We scare easily.\u201d He walked forward and opened the door to the cafeteria for me.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m in mourning, Blake, and it\u2019s a full year before we wear colors again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s for widows in the eighteen hundreds. I miss you in spring colors and shorts. I miss you having color on your skin. I miss your eyes, and how they used to sparkle. Now they\u2019re dull, like fish eyes. When that Aimee comes back, I think I\u2019ll have a party.\u201d</p><p>Us at a party? He was the only boy in the world who I could actually imagine myself with. We matched. The idea of it made me wonder. Wondering made me forget how sad I was. It was a vicious cycle.</p><p>I walked through the door laughing. \u201cWho will come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chess club, matheletes, obviously us science geeks, and I like the kids at the newspaper. They\u2019re not as smart as we are, but they know politics and a lot of them believe the CT\u2019s, Aimes. I have to respect that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again, even though it hurt my sides to do so. My laughing muscles had grown soft and weak over the past winter. Blake believed in CT\u2019s, Conspiracy Theories. He believed nothing the media wrote. Well, unless university students or someone working for some low budget paper wrote it. The kind that relied on a mailing list as opposed to general publication for the masses.</p><p>He smacked me in the arm, frowning. \u201cDude, did you see the Facebook posts coming off my mom lately?\u201d I shook my head as he took off on a tangent.</p><p>\u201cClearly people don\u2019t get the whole\u2014it's for connecting or reconnecting with people\u2014it's not Twitter. My mom has what she ate for lunch yesterday, she has that she went to her yoga class, she has that she bought a new bra, and for her friends to check that store out. What the hell? I told her that from now on, I\u2019m posting everything I do in a day.\u201d</p><p>His face was red as he ranted. I loved his rants.</p><p>\u201cI told her tomorrow my Facebook status is going to read, 'Blake McGinnis had a great shit today, came out with very little pushing. I just want to thank Kellogg\u2019s for upping the fiber count in the cereal.\u201d</p><p>I started to laugh again as we walked to the nerd table, where the other nerds raised eyebrows at me laughing.</p><p>He continued, \u201cI think then about three hours later I will put, 'Blake McGinnis just held his cat Chuck down and sniffed his neck fur.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even stop myself if I wanted to. The laughing started to get quite painful.</p><p>His arms flailed about now. \u201cThen I think at around seven I will post, \u2018Blake McGinnis is questioning his humanity and had a bad thought about his neighbors.\u2019 Then at least my mom will have something to think about. Jesus, I get tired of reading this crap.\u201d</p><p>I enjoyed thinking about something other than myself.</p><p>On that day, in that moment, I felt like the Grinch. My chest expanded and my heart seemed to shake off its icy winter coat and let in the spring sunlight. I didn\u2019t know what to do with the new sense of freedom I was having, but in that instant, the school looked brighter. I noticed the other kids talking and making movements. Before, I would have ignored it to the point of obsession.</p><p>After lunch we walked into class and I felt peaceful. Mr. Mac smiled at the class, explaining how to get ready for the experiment. The sunlight shone in the windows and the air sparkled with dust and inspiration.</p><p>For the first time, without feeling like I had betrayed my mom, I looked forward to something. Chemistry was my favorite class and not for the same reasons as all the other girls. Unfortunately for Mr. Mac, every girl in school had a crush on him. He looked much more like a student than a teacher, having only just graduated with his master's. It earned him hottie teacher status, which he seemed oblivious to.</p><p>He was handsome, but I only noticed it after my sister pointed it out to me. Something about his face didn\u2019t do it for me. He was not my type. My type hadn\u2019t changed in ten years. The only problem with \u2018my type\u2019 was his current status as my sister's boyfriend. I shook my thoughts back to my schoolwork.</p><p>It was easy to do in chem. For me, chemistry was simple. The reaction was caused by the chemicals or elements involved. No surprises and no guessing. I loved the reaction of chemicals and the predictability that came with knowing the elements. It was a controlled environment. Blake loved chem too, but it was because Mr. Mac was his hero; he held three degrees and a master\u2019s by the time he was twenty-four.</p><p>On the way home from school, I took a detour instead of the bus or a ride with Satan, a.k.a. Alise. I felt a small sense of serenity as I saw the spot and smiled. I always imagined my mom waited for me there. The wind blew my long blonde hair up\u2014like a tornado, it sucked it up into the air. I ran to her spot and sat down on the roadside. I tried not to shiver as the cold concrete froze my legs the moment I sat.</p><p>I had gathered the new dandelions of the year in my pocket on the way and made myself a crown as I sat there talking.</p><p>\u201cSo then Mr. Mac said that I could just do my own project, since my partner wasn\u2019t there, again. God, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with her, but it\u2019s been like four classes and she\u2019s still sick. Maybe it\u2019s the plague. I like Mr. Mac; he treats us like people, not students. He is an actual chemist too, not a gym teacher filling in a spot.\u201d</p><p>I finished my crown and placed it on my head, as a tear rolled down my cheek. \u201cThere, just like you made.\u201d I pushed back my pain and smiled; my mom didn\u2019t need to see me sad like that all the time.</p><p>Just as I needed it to be, it was there\u2014the warm wind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My skin lifted with a shiver as I closed my eyes and let the wind surround me. I knew people made fun of the fact that I would go and sit on the side of the road, beside the tree where I\u2019d made the mark.</p><p>The fact that my mom hadn\u2019t died anywhere near the tree made me the town weirdo. In truth, though, someone had died there. I had, which was why I haunted it.</p><p>Twenty-eight hundred people populated the little seaside hamlet of a town. In Port Mackenzie, everyone noticed when Don James's quiet daughter sat on the side of the road, talking to a tree.</p> <p>I looked at the mark on the tree and felt a slight bit of shame for hurting it that way. There, in the torn bark and skin of the tree, my blood made a cross. I had pulled and ripped the bark in a panic, cutting my hands up, so I would never lose the spot.</p><p>I was surprised that the blood hadn\u2019t washed away in the winter rains. The tree held onto enough color that I could always find it. The bloodstain was old and brown, but if you knew where to look, you could see the faint outline of the cross. Perhaps the tree knew I needed it. I smiled at the mark, grateful that someone understood me.</p><p>I sat there staring at the mark, realizing I had come a long way in the months since her death. I knew that soon I would be normal again. I could feel it. My heart would be healed soon.</p><p>Blake was part to blame with his funny sarcastic ways, which cheered me up, even when I resisted. I smiled, thinking about him distractedly. I wondered if we would ever become lovers or if we would just get married. I knew we were perfect for each other. It just made sense. If truth be told, all that stood in the way of us being together was our inexperience with the opposite sex.</p><p>I had wanted a boyfriend a while before my mom's accident. I wanted something romantic like an Austen novel. After her death, I wasn\u2019t certain I could face the feelings I had without my mother to advise me.</p> <p>I betrayed my pact not to cry at her spot, as tears dripped down my cheeks. I wasn\u2019t sad for my loss but for the peace and fun I'd been experiencing.</p><p>\u201cMom, I can\u2019t fight it much longer. I can\u2019t stay sad forever. I\u2019m trying to honor you and I know this isn\u2019t what you would have wanted, but I don\u2019t know how else to see you.\u201d I heaved. \u201cI see Alise so happy and normal and I hate her. If I\u2019m not sad, do I miss you the same amount?\u201d</p><p>I let the tears fall. I stared down at the cement, trying to see the design my splashed tears made on the concrete. I felt a cool wind twirl around me. It felt like the winds of change would, refreshing and energizing. I knew my mom would want me to be happy.</p><p>I stood up, feeling blood rushing back into my legs with painful pins and needles. \u201cLove you, Mom. See you soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>When I got home my sister pouted in the corner, with a face that could devastate a coastline. Our father had put her on restricted party attendance for a month. Alise hadn\u2019t been to a party in four weeks, which no doubt affected her most-popular girl in school status. Our father was a marine biologist, so his sympathies didn\u2019t lie with social standing.</p><p>Her big silver eyes glistened as if she had been crying. It wouldn\u2019t have surprised me if she had. She would pull out all the stops to get her way. Even at eighteen, I had seen fainting, holding breath, screaming, not talking to people for months on end, refusal to eat or drink, and many, many more dramatics. It always seemed to be in the pursuit of her eternal happiness, which only ever lasted about an hour.</p> <p>I rolled my eyes as my sister's gaze fixed on me. Instantly, I could see the cogs begin to move as the desperation clicked into action. I witnessed an evil plan, formed in the mind of the feeble but wicked scheming brat, come to life. Seeing my sneer, she shifted gears.</p><p>I watched as the fa\u00e7ade crept across her face. I hated getting dragged into her schemes. Watching her had a similar feel to watching the weather change.</p><p>She smiled her prettiest smile at me. \u201cThere's a party tonight, at Shane\u2019s house. It\u2019s going to be a huge party, Aimes\u2014a fun party. Come with me? It's senior year. Come on. Pretty pleeeasse. How can the girlfriend not be at the party? This could end our relationship. He could cheat on me, or think I\u2019m lying about not being allowed, and think I\u2019m cheating. My love life depends on this party.\u201d</p><p>My heart dropped. Of course, that was why Shane had asked me to go to his party. It hurt but I knew it made sense. He wanted his girlfriend at the party. For a smart girl, I was dumb when it came to flirting, obviously.</p><p>I squeezed my lips together and thought about Blake. Blake was the one who was right for me.</p><p>She begged on her hands and knees and pouted her perfect-glossed lips at me, like I was a boy under her spell. Her silver eyes sparkled, as she batted her lashes like butterfly wings.</p><p>I felt the disgust on my face. \u201cYou know I\u2019m a girl, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly, with what you're wearing, Aimes.\u201d Alise sneered at me. Noticing the look of revulsion on my face, she shifted back to batting her eyelashes at me.</p> <p>I had to confess, the idea of being at Shane\u2019s house did make my heart ache.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at her again. \u201cYour pouty lips and eyelashes do nothing for me.\u201d I grabbed a cookie and some chocolate soymilk. \u201cBesides, I have plans tonight.\u201d It was raid night in my guild.</p><p>I finished my snack and walked to the counter in the kitchen to put my empty glass down on the bar.</p><p>I could see her eyes twitching as her poor simple brain worked overtime. She tried, in desperation, to come up with a bargaining chip.</p><p>I imagined the poor little hamster that moved the thoughts around inside her mind was in there, gasping for air on his little wheel.</p><p>\u201cAimee, I can\u2019t go without you. I'll do your laundry and be nice to you for a month. Even at school.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed my lips together, contemplating the possibility. My brain ran through the possibilities and scenarios involving her doing both those things. It seemed like a winning situation. I could see Shane and have my laundry done.</p><p>I nodded and ignored the sick feeling of making a deal with the devil. \u201cOk deal, but you have to be nice to me and Blake for a month, and do my laundry according to washing instructions, and drive me anywhere I want. And I want drink service tonight, nothing nasty or filled with booze, but good drinks all night, handed to me from your hand to mine. And I\u2019m bringing Blake tonight, and you have to drive us to the party, as you would any other friend. I'm not riding in the trunk.\u201d</p><p>Alise stuck her hand out, excited. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>I walked past her, sneering at her hand. \u201cLike I would touch that hand. Please, I know where your hands go. Besides, you have no honor. I will draw up a contract and I\u2019ll tell Blake to be ready for eight.\u201d I imagined she would want it signed in blood, like all evil demons.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a bitch, Aimee, a funny bitch. Eight sounds like it\u2019s on.\u201d She jumped up and down excited. I had sold my soul to the devil.</p><p>\"Keep pissing me off and I'll make you sign it in blood.\"</p><p>I went to my room to decide on an outfit for the night. I wanted to go to the party. It was a new feeling, not \u2018since my mom's accident\u2019 new, but since forever. I had never been the party type.</p><p>I wondered if being at a party would help Blake loosen up, or if he would be cranky all night long. Would he even want to come with me? If he came, would he at least try to kiss me? I had it planned out from the kiss. I just didn\u2019t know how to get us there. I imagined we would kiss and then we could start our courting before university. My heart didn\u2019t beat any faster at the idea of kissing Blake, but I knew we loved each other.</p><p>I had never been kissed and it seemed like the most amazing experience when it happened in books or the movies. The idea of kissing Blake didn\u2019t make me feel like the world would stop to give notice to our kiss, but I knew he was right for me. One side of me was reasonable and the other was romantic, just like my parents.</p><p>I just didn\u2019t know which side should win in the case of romance. Alise always seemed to be in love based on her heart's decisions, and that never panned out\u2014ever.</p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror and pictured myself in a ball gown. My dress would be soft lavender-colored and my hair would be in an up-do. I reached behind and made a bun with my hair. I could see myself, ready for the ball. I closed my eyes and imagined Blake in a tux, but he wasn\u2019t Blake. It was Shane, standing tall and handsome and putting a hand out for me. I put a hand out, trying to ignore the ridiculous smile crossing my lips.</p><p>My heart ached again. I opened my eyes to see a flushed face looking back at me in the huge stand-up mirror. There was an awfully guilty look on the face of the girl in the mirror.</p><p>I put my hand down and turned to face reality. Shane liked my sister and barely knew I existed, except as a tutor or the sister of the girl he dated. No biggie. As Mr. Collins would have said, 'Blake was a very agreeable alternative.' Blake was my soul mate, or at least the mate of my mind, which I felt was more important in the long run.</p><p>I turned and went to my closet to start getting ready. My closet was bleak, or rather black. It seemed some time ago, I had gone through everything and removed all of the color and joy from my closet.</p><p>I groaned and grabbed a black pair of skinny jeans and a dark-blue sweater. I changed and looked at my reflection with a smirk. My sister was right, which had never happened, our mom would freak if she were here.</p><p>My long, blonde hair hung around my gaunt face. My eyes had dulled to a lifeless grey, with no zest or expression. My skin seemed not just white, but powdered and flat. I looked skinnier than ever and my skinny jeans looked ridiculous, hanging off of my body.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but worry about the girl in mirror. Her once perky nose looked a little big on her face, which had grown horridly thin. Her full lips looked chapped and peeling. I grimaced at the girl. Not kissable. Her eyebrows looked like they needed a little weed whacking and her hair was stringy.</p><p>I truly looked like a Goth. I couldn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cOh my God\u2014you're not wearing that! Take that off. I will be right back.\u201d Alise was in and out before I could register what had happened. Without warning, she stripped the clothes off of me. She tore off the sweater and pulled on a pink t-shirt, without caring how rough she did it. The long t-shirt had red lips down low on the left side. She undid my jeans to tear them off, as she knocked me to the bed and pulled at them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rambled on about being old enough to dress myself, which made me blush as she dragged on the new jeans. They were dreadful. They were light blue with frayed pockets in the back and subtle whiskers in the front. There was an intentional rip in the right knee.</p><p>I hated the outfit instantly and wanted to undress the minute I saw myself in the mirror. I looked like one of her friends, which bothered me. I didn\u2019t even want to think about the fact that I looked better.</p><p>That being said, I felt like I wore a flashing sign that shouted, \u2018look at me!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten too skinny for skinny jeans and you look horrid in black. You\u2019re a spring/summer, Aimee. You need color.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed my arm and dragged me to her room, which could only be described as a cluttered and disgusting mess. I grimaced at the odor I couldn\u2019t quite place, maybe I could. It was 'L\u2019eau de Homeless Man' who peed his pants and ate nachos.</p><p>\u201cYou want Blake to like you, Aimes? You need to put a little makeup on and try a little harder. Guys don\u2019t ask out girls who\u2019ve already crossed over into spinsterhood. Here, try this,\u201d she said as she made me sit in her makeup chair. Her hands flew up at me, as she started applying things to my face. I never spoke. I shut my sister out like usual and told myself I could wash my face when the torment ended. Alise tweezed and groomed like Edward Scissorhands, using both hands to do the work.</p><p>\u201cYou like Blake, right?\u201d she asked without waiting for me to answer. \u201cWell, you need to grab a guy like him and tell him you like him. He\u2019s smart, but not in relationships.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, trying to pacify her as she ranted. I grimaced at her holding something that looked like a torture device and moving toward my eyes. \u201cYou know, when I liked Benny, he never knew for the first few weeks, but then I just told him one night at a pit party and we dated for like six months. Till I caught him with that slut Meagan; that was disgusting.\u201d</p> <p>This was the story of Alise\u2019s life. She had already dated at least fifteen boys in the last four years.</p><p>I had still not dated a boy once.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t from lack of desire but more lack of options. The only boy I had ever liked was the one my sister was dating, Shane.</p><p>Shane, who always seemed to be out of my league or dating another girl. A lot of other girls.</p><p>I had liked him from grade two on, but I never told anyone. I sighed, realizing he was ruined forever, having no doubt had sex with my sister. I threw up a tiny bit in my mouth and grimaced thinking about it.</p><p>I was stuck with Blake, not that it was a bad option, but I knew there wasn\u2019t any romance in the choice. Even worse, he was shyer than I was.</p> <p>She messed with my hair, ignoring the faces I made while processing my love life. \u201cYou can\u2019t, like, graduate a virgin. Aimee . . . university is not the place to lose it. And dude, if you continue the way you\u2019re going, you\u2019ll be in your twenties and a virgin. Aimes, no guys want to date a twenty-five year old virgin. There, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>She stepped back and swung the chair to face her mirror. I prepared myself for the worst\u2014 painted whore like her friends or maybe like a clown. I worried about the latter as she had been kind to me. I tried not to think about the fact that I had roped her into a month of extra laundry as I took my first look.</p><p>I looked remarkable.</p><p>The girl staring back at me looked attractive, and I could barely see the makeup. Alise had respected the fact that I was a minimalist.</p><p>\u201cYou have a talent, Alise...this is miraculous,\u201d I whispered as I touched my cheeks, not feeling greasy makeup. My lips looked full and plump, and my blue eyes were noticeable and sparkly.</p><p>She stood behind me in the mirror, smiling at her work. \u201cYou look like we could even be friends, like a cheerleader or something.\u201d</p><p>And there it was, the old, mean and nasty snot of a sister I was accustomed to. \u201cYeah, well, don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms and gave me the look of doom. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything to get dirty or make a mess of yourself, and don\u2019t eat. Just sit somewhere till eight.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed as I left her room, feeling like an idiot for being talked into it. I walked back to my room to play World of Warcraft while I waited for it to be time.</p><p>Lost in the game a while later, deep in thought about the Alliance member I was creaming, my father interrupted me.</p><p>\u201cYou're doing this then?\u201d Dad asked, as I slaughtered a noob Alliance player with my fellow guildies.</p><p>\u201cPlay World of Warcraft, yeah. I play everyday. Dad...please...you need to start paying attention to our comings and goings. It's getting frightening in here without any parental control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you play. It costs me fifteen dollars every month, kiddo; I notice. Whoever thought that game up is a genius.\u201d</p><p>I never took my eyes off the screen as I spoke, \u201cDuly noted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant the party. It\u2019s not your thing. You don\u2019t have to go.\u201d His flat tone sounded as if he played it up, but secretly excited I would be going.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, she promised me the moon and stars.\u201d My eyes still never left the screen.</p><p>\u201cBe safe and don\u2019t drink, okay?\u201d</p><p>I turned to face him while the flags reset in my game of capture the flag. \u201cDad, it's okay. When do I drink? I think you\u2019re in the wrong room; Sleazy Drunks is next door. This is Dorks with Anonymity. Did you eat yet?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head chuckling. \u201cNo, I ordered some pizza. Vince is coming over later. He wants to watch the game.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cWho\u2019s playing?\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair and laughed. \u201cOh...well...you know me and sports, kiddo. But adult company and some pizza will be a pleasant diversion.\u201d</p><p>I laughed at my father. \u201cYeah, I guess we are both being held hostage for the evening.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkled for a moment. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s what we need, Aimee. We don\u2019t seem to be getting past this on our own. You look pretty, by the way. Want me to get a veggie burger when I pick up the pizza?\u201d</p><p>I smiled looking him right in the eye, which I never did anymore, and nodded as he left my room.</p><p>My sister drove like a crazed woman, making all the pickup stops along the way. Blake and I sat squished in the back with a guy name Tommy, who had dated my sister and flirted mercilessly with everything that moved.</p><p>\u201cHey Aimee, looking good. You clean up nice,\u201d he spoke in a soothing tone, as if trying to charm me or tame me like a wild animal. I wasn\u2019t sure which.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t really see how a t-shirt is cleaned up, but thanks Tommy.\u201d I rolled my eyes at Blake, who muffled a laugh.</p><p>\u201cMcGinnis, dude, you\u2019re way too big for the back seat. You should have tried out for basketball. What are you, six-one?\u201d he asked Blake, trying to make conversation.</p><p>Blake smiled. \u201cUhm... six-three...but I am not the sporting sort. That is best left for the coordinated.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me, which I knew meant he didn\u2019t want to be in this car full of the popular kids. They always asked him to join sports, based on his height and the fact that his parents were ridiculously rich. Team funding was a huge issue in a small town.</p><p>I laughed at his grumpy face, as he whispered to me, \u201cYou look nice. Pink is an improvement to black.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my tongue out, almost feeling guilty to be having fun and laughing. Deep down, I knew my mom would want me to have a life again, even if it was Alise\u2019s life.</p><p>We pulled into a long driveway far from the road to Shane Bagley\u2019s house. His dad and mom had recently split, causing a rift in our small town. Shane\u2019s father had been caught having relations, so to speak, with a checkout girl at the local grocery store. The store Shane's family owned. Shane\u2019s mom had kicked him out, only to find out that he moved in with his twenty-five year old employee.</p><p>Shane had taken it hard, just as any of us would. Eighteen is too young to have a family torn apart by a new stepmom. In particular, one that\u2019s only seven years older than her new stepson.</p><p>Alise had been sucked into the drama, her specialty if truth were told. She had gone from nearly dumping Shane to a devoted woman. She loved drama. It made me sick. As Shane went from being Plain Shane to heartbroken Shane, she got more into him. She never stopped cheating on him though.</p><p>I never understood why he chose to date my sister. He never seemed to enjoy the relationship. He hardly ever hung out with her, and when he did, they barely spoke. Alise had complained about it, but our father told her Shane was distracted by the tragedy in his family.</p><p>Shane\u2019s mom had been vacationing more than normal in the last few months. In such a small town, it had people speculating that she was, in reality, in a center somewhere. I felt bad for Shane.</p><p>His only saving grace was that he had an older sister in university in the city. She came back on weekends, even though it was a five-hour drive, to help him out while his parents were both AWOL.</p><p>The music from the house could be heard from the long driveway. The large waterfront home seemed to have every light on inside and out, even though it wasn't dark yet.</p><p>Cars lined the driveway as Alise found a spot up beside Shane's truck. People bailed from her old car, boys picking girls up and running with them over their shoulders, and girls screaming in joy. I was certain that I watched someone climb out of the trunk.</p><p>The music stopped and my heart skipped a beat for a second. Shane came out to greet us. Behind him, the open door revealed a packed house. The huge windows in the living room looked like peeking onto a set of an American Pie movie.</p><p>He stood there, looking breathtaking. His eyes zeroed in on me. \u201cHey Aimee, I\u2019m glad you came. Hi, Blake.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to take it the wrong way, but I knew why he wanted me there. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that Blake stood closer to me and puffed up his chest. I blushed, thinking that he must have noticed my crush on Shane and resented it.</p><p>I gave Shane a small wave and tiny smile. Mostly, I tried not to look at his lips and imagine what they would be like to kiss.</p><p>My sister walked up and kissed him on the cheek, making me want to disinfect him so I could continue my fantasy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blake and I leaned against the car and watched the scene, taking it in. After my sister's little indiscretion of not coming home a month ago, our father had laid down the rule of no more parties. He had given her one option, to take me as her companion, which translated into chaperone. He had bet on the fact that I would never go, and clearly he had bet wrong. I knew deep down that he wanted to see me out socializing with someone beyond Blake. Not to mention, he was probably relieved I would be there to keep an eye on Alise.</p><p>I looked at Blake and noticed he looked handsome. I realized he didn\u2019t have his glasses on, which was odd. I wasn\u2019t sure if he even owned contacts or if he had come blind, hoping to look less like a nerd. Either way, he looked good without glasses and a gadget in his hands.</p><p>I grinned at him. He looked nervous but like he was excited to be there. I was the opposite; I wasn\u2019t nervous and didn\u2019t want to be anywhere near the popular people. Except one. But alas, Satan had spit on him, like he was the last donut on the plate, so my option became viewing him from a distance.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to go in?\u201d</p><p>Blake nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d He swallowed hard and we walked up to the house. He seemed massive with nothing in his hands to make him stoop over until he was my height. He looked put together in his beige cords and blue t-shirt with a science-camp logo. I smiled knowing no one there would even come close to recognizing the logo. I felt short next to him as we walked along the concrete slab walkway to the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou cold?\u201d he asked. I felt a warm wind hit me and I shivered. I shook my head, frowning. I wondered if the wind was really my mom telling me not to go in. I felt her wind a second time and told myself she meant for me to have a good time.</p><p>My heart couldn\u2019t help but beat harder as my skin craved feeling that wind again.</p><p>I looked to the right and saw a guy I had never seen around town. He was tall and thick with dark-blond hair and the most stunning blue eyes I had ever seen. They looked like a husky dog's. White blue but bright, like there was a light shining out from behind his eyes. He looked like an actor in a movie, not a guy at a teenager party. His face was like something you didn\u2019t see in such a small town. I felt my breath taken away as I locked eyes with him. I wanted to walk to him. I knew him from somewhere. He looked at me for a moment. When our eyes met, I had the distinct feeling that I knew him from somewhere. He smiled at me and my legs felt like they went to goo.</p> <p>He seemed surprised when I pointed to him. \u201cWho is that guy?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Blake and nudged him. When I looked back, he was gone.</p><p>Blake shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him.\u201d</p><p>\"There was a big, tall blond guy right there a second ago. I think I know him.\"</p><p>\"He's not there now.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, Captain Obvious.\"</p> <p>A girl beside me spoke, \u201cThis place is packed with kids from Port Handley. They\u2019re friends with Shane.\u201d I recognized her as I turned around. My sister's bff, Giselle. Not only the most beautiful girl in the world, but also the most exotic. Her parents were French and Filipino. She staggered as she entered the house.</p><p>\u201cClearly not her first drink of the evening,\u201d Blake whispered as we walked into the house.</p><p>I looked out the window again, hoping to see the guy from the neighboring town. His eyes had mystified me. He had seemed so familiar to me, like I had dreamed of him. The guy was stunningly handsome. Adding an air of mystery didn\u2019t help my curiosity.</p><p>Shaking it off, I looked around the house at the drunken teenagers everywhere.</p><p>\u201cWant a drink, little sister?\u201d Alise was beside me with a glass.</p><p>I took it, suspicious of anything she ever gave me. I looked into the glass. It appeared to be lemonade.</p><p>\u201cIt's lemonade, Aimee\u2014remember the deal we made,\u201d she laughed as I eyeballed her. \u201cBesides, I might need you to drive home.\u201d</p><p>\"I don\u2019t want to drive.\"</p> <p>She walked away.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Alise.\u201d Blake beamed after her. I frowned at him and watched as he looked into the glass she had given him and took a drink. I waited a few seconds for the foam to start pouring out of his lip. He sipped from the glass and remained standing. I drank when I was sure I would live. I was surprised by the flavor. It was a great glass of lemonade. I was shocked Alise was holding up her end of the bargain, shocked and suspicious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s loud in here; want to go to a quieter room?\u201d I asked Blake, who nodded.</p><p>People who saw us took a second look, when it registered that nerds had crashed the party. They maintained a steady glare in our direction as they conversed.</p><p>\u201cNot in the least bit obvious, are they?\u201d Blake asked, sipping his drink and looking around the room. His grumpy face was back. I wondered if, deep down, he had hoped to be accepted by them. I had never seen Blake care about what the popular kids thought or did until that moment.</p><p>We walked past the kitchen where Shane stood in a group of the popular kids. He looked over at me and smiled. I loved how his face lit up when he saw me. I wanted to talk to him, but Alise put a hand on his arm and laughed with the group of football players and girls that looked like my sister. Shane looked embarrassed and dropped his gaze, blushing as they all continued to talk.</p><p>I glanced up at Blake and decided it was time to start making some of my dreams come true. Blake was the answer to the question of who would make me happy. We were the same in every way. We could play World of Warcraft in a room and not even need to speak. There was a cozy comfort between us that I would never find in anyone else.</p><p>We found a sunroom off the back of the house, where there were couches and a few couples making out in the muted light. The lights were dimmed and the music seemed a lot quieter. To me, it would be the perfect place to pass a few hours till we got to go home.</p><p>I sat on the older floral couch and admired the pictures of Shane and his sister that lined the walls of the sunroom, above where a large fireplace sat. Only on the Northwest Coast would there be a wood stove in a sunroom.</p><p>Blake sat down beside me. He seemed to be uncomfortable and nervous in the make-out room. I decided to go with the flow of the room and take my sister's advice.</p><p>I turned to look him in the eyes, and I took a deep breath. \u201cBlake, I need to tell you something. I like you.\u201d It shot from my lips like a bullet from a gun.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI like you too, Aimes; you\u2019re my best friend\u2014pink shirt or no pink shirt. At least it isn\u2019t black or one of the variations. I've never seen anyone find as many different ways to depress their wardrobe as you have.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and started to feel a little breathless. \u201cNo, I mean I really like you, like how they like each other.\u201d I pointed to the couples making out that, clearly were, fond of one another. I took another deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about this long and hard, and we make sense for each other. We\u2019re both smart, we both want to go to university, and we both love intellectually challenging and advancing experiences. I've thought about it, and if we sit down, I believe we can come up with a reasonable, five-year plan.\u201d My spiel didn't sound as good as I had hoped it would.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cLike them\u2014you like me like them?\u201d He pointed and seemed to look panicked, if not flabbergasted.</p><p>I nodded, gulping as he looked around at each of them and then back to me.</p><p>\u201cAimee, you are the most incredible girl I have ever met. You\u2019re my favorite person in the whole world. You are graduating with advanced placement in literature, but at the same time, rock at trig and advanced chemistry. You\u2019re funny and really pretty--\u201d he started to fret.</p><p>I interrupted. \u201cBut...\u201d My heart dropped into my stomach.</p><p>Embarrassment flushed across his face, as he grasped at straws. \u201cI think the world of you. You must know that.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms. \u201cBlake, I told you how I feel\u2014just say what you need to say.\u201d I felt myself getting angry, as he flailed in front of me. My stomach weakened, waiting for the final crushing blow.</p><p>He closed his eyes and shook his head. \u201cI wish you had never said those words. I need you in my life, the way things are. I don\u2019t feel the same way. You are the sister I always wanted. I love you, but it's not the same.\u201d</p><p>I knew it was coming, but it hurt more than I thought it would. I had counted on him liking me to feel like a normal girl. He had always been my back-up plan for love. I thought that as long as he liked me, it didn\u2019t matter that all the other boys didn\u2019t.</p><p>I knew that to be a girl who felt good about her body image, I didn\u2019t need the approval of boys. I knew it to be a truth, but at the same time, I had wanted Blake to like me. Somehow believing that Blake liked me in the romantic way made me just a little more confident. I felt that confidence leave my body like air leaving a balloon.</p><p>None of my fantasy would ever come true, and I truly would always be an unlovable monster.</p><p>I nodded, trying to avoid the weight of the discovery. \u201cI need some air, Blake. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand out to stop me, but I burst past him, leaving him in the make out room.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hate him\u2014I couldn\u2019t hate him. I hated myself for banking on him being the one I could fall back on in my time of desperation and loneliness. I felt so frustrated and embarrassed. I had been so certain. He had led me to believe it. I thought of the million times he touched my hand or smiled at me. The way he kept his gaze after he smiled, lingering. He came to my house everyday. I thought about when my mom died and how he had slept in my bed with me for two weeks, holding me. Had I misread it all?</p><p>Tears threatened to spring from my eyes, but I looked around at the ridiculous group of drunken teenagers and knew I would never cry in front of them.</p><p>I rushed through the back door in the kitchen and felt the refreshing wind hit me, like a beacon of safety. I ran down the back steps of the deck onto the back lawn. Shane had a massive yard with a small amount of oceanfront. Really though, the whole town had either oceanfront or ocean view.</p><p>I walked to the far side of the lawn, where I sat down on the cool grass. I lay back and looked up at the sky as it darkened and the first few stars became visible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My sister had chosen a car for our birthday, but I had opted for a telescope. I wished I were at home with it. Instead, I was lonely, embarrassed, and surrounded by people who would mock me as an appetizer. I felt my face burning, thinking I had imagined that I had a chance with him or any guy.</p><p>My sister could have any guy she wanted. She even had the one guy I truly wanted. But I couldn\u2019t even get the guy no one wanted. Well, besides the other nerdy girls at our lunch table. Blake was the nerd hottie.</p><p>I covered my face and shook my head. I wished I could take it all back.</p> <p>Being a rational romantic hadn't panned out like I\u2019d hoped it would. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if being a twit like my sister paid off. She did seem happier than I ever did, by a long shot. I contemplated the possibility of playing dumb and twirling my hair.</p><p>I picked up a lock of my blonde mane and twirled one thick chunk over my face. It did seem relaxing in a repetitive way but definitely couldn\u2019t replace thinking for me, no matter what.</p><p>I heard the grass beside me crunching and assumed it would be Blake, coming to try to rationalize with me. I prepared for the most embarrassing conversation ever. I decided standing and running would be my best bet.</p><p>I panicked even more when I recognized Shane\u2019s voice from behind me. \u201cYou okay, Aimee? I saw you run out the back door. I thought maybe you were sick.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the grass next to me and lay back. I clenched inside and tried not breathing. I contemplated the hair twirl but decided on playing it cool.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not much of a partier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming. I was hoping you would come to a party at least once before grad.\u201d He had always been an easy person to be around. I noticed it when we were little kids. Had I not been completely humiliated, I would have enjoyed being with him.</p><p>\"Remember when we were little and how easy life was?\" I asked before my inner filter stopped me.</p><p>He rolled on his side and grinned at me. \"Yeah. It was so much easier to just be happy then. All that mattered was how many frogs you caught or how high you could climb.\"</p><p>I laughed. \"You could just be who you were and no one cared.\"</p><p>\"I've always liked who you were. Well, are. I mean, I like who you are now, too.\" I glanced at him and laughed. He shook his head and lie back on the grass again.</p> <p>\"Thanks. I like who you are, too.\" Uncomfortable with the direction it was going, I changed the subject. \u201cSo, who is that guy from Handley with the crazy blue eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue eyes? Oh, you mean Wade. His family owns the gym there. He plays hockey and goes out with Melissa Grouper.\u201d He spoke, trying to jog my memory, but I came up blank.</p><p>Thinking about him made me smile. \u201cHis eyes are crazy blue...weird blue. I swear I know him from somewhere,\u201d I muttered more to myself than him.</p><p>\"Hmm, maybe at school. He\u2019s pretty serious about Melissa; has been for about three years. Speaking of guys\u2014what\u2019s up with you and Blake?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He had been convinced, as I had been, that we would be something more than friends. It wasn\u2019t just me thinking it. Alise, Shane, and I, had seen the signs. It didn\u2019t make me feel better. I was still humiliated.</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing now and nothing ever. We are friends. Friends who can sleep beside each other and be comfortable, but I guess that\u2019s it. I\u2019m destined to be alone forever.\u201d The words flew out before I could think about them, or my tone.</p><p>Shane laughed. \u201cOkay, okay, Jeeze. You and your sister have that in common, I guess. There is more spice in you two than sugar.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at the comparison. \u201cSorry. You\u2019re right\u2014that might be the only thing we have in common, unfortunately.\u201d Besides loving you. I thought to myself, even though I knew Alise didn\u2019t love him. I didn\u2019t even believe she liked him. I knew for a fact that she'd been having ongoing affairs with every guy she knew. I had dreamed of helping Shane find out about her. I'd even planned how I would do it. I just didn\u2019t want to be the reason her eternal happiness was destroyed. Her eternal happiness that only ever lasted the afternoon.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re night and day, there is no doubt. I\u2019m kind of glad, though.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at him and sighed. His sandy-colored hair was always styled choppy. I wondered if he styled it or just left it when he got up out of bed. He had a warm smile; the other girls always talked about how hot he was. There was no doubt.</p><p>Beyond his looks, I always loved his kindness. There was something more to him than met the eye, too. Like his eyes held a secret passion. The kind of passion that only the person he loved would understand. He was like a treasure chest. If you were lucky enough to find the key, you could spend a lifetime enjoying what was inside of it. He was always kind and cool around everyone, but I could see the underlying passionate romantic.</p><p>I noticed he was looking at me. It wasn't that his eyes never left my face, but the intensity of them made me uncomfortable. It made my stomach feel weird, a good weird. I wanted him to move closer. I wanted him to stretch his hand across the grass and take mine.</p><p>I wanted it more than anything in the world. I would have given up food, air or water to have him touch my hand, even in kindness. Okay, I wouldn\u2019t have, but dammit, I wanted him to touch me.</p><p>\u201cYou look nice tonight. Finally wearing colors again, huh?\u201d His voice seemed laced with some kind of emotion.</p><p>I looked at him quizzically. \u201cYeah, how did you notice I was only wearing black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI notice you, Aimee, everyday.\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped.</p><p>Those were magic words. I squealed with joy in my mind but remained calm, even though I freaked out inside my head. My super-hot sister\u2019s boyfriend was hitting on me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say or do.</p><p>Maybe he was just being nice to me, or maybe I was being an over-reactive idiot. His eyes didn\u2019t seem to say kind; they looked more like steamy. I smiled inside, enjoying the moment.</p><p>I panicked and looked away from him, pretending to look back up at the stars. I made myself remember Alise had already been there and polluted that. It wasn\u2019t that I truly cared, but I needed an excuse to not like him. Whether I hated Alise or not, I wasn\u2019t going to steal my sister\u2019s boyfriend.</p><p>I struggled in the silence, not sure what to say. I tried to relax.</p><p>\"I noticed you were different tonight, right away.\"</p><p>I gulped again. \"Alise got a hold of me. She's against black, unless it\u2019s a cocktail dress or lingerie. She was savage about it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my sister, but I would never date anyone that abusive. I guess guys tolerate a lot more than girls do, though.\u201d</p><p>He sounded lost in his thoughts. \u201cYeah, otherwise the world would stop going 'round.\u201d</p><p>\"I guess.\"</p><p>We sat in silence staring at the stars for a long time. He was my kind of company.</p><p>\u201cSo Blake isn\u2019t the one for you, huh?\u201d he asked again, but sounding more nonchalantly.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNope. I guess I thought we should be together 'cause we\u2019re the same type of person, you know. I like having him there, knowing someone liked me.\"</p><p>The words hurt to say, but it hurt even more, when my brain whispered, No one does.</p><p>\u201cWell, that sounds ridiculous. You want to keep him on standby, so that you know someone likes you?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cEverything sounds bad when you say it like that, all judgmental and hateful. You make me sound like Alise.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not really one of those sugar-coat people. I know you're nothing like her.\u201d</p><p>I looked back over at him, instantly startled by how intently he looked at me.</p><p>He bit his lip for a moment and then muttered, \u201cSo, you aren\u2019t in love with him?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head as my brain whispered again, 'Just embarrassed.'</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so amazing, Aimee. You don\u2019t need boys on standby. You just need to go for the right guy. He's not the only guy who could like you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes locked on mine and he leaned toward me. I could see it in his eyes. He was fully going to kiss me. I felt nervous but didn\u2019t move or breathe in anticipation.</p><p>He reached forward and brushed his hand along my cheek. His blue eyes lit up. \"I have something I want to tell you.\"</p><p>My stomach twisted into knots.</p><p>He bent his face, but just as I felt his breath upon my lips, we were interrupted by a crash behind us.</p><p>\"Son of a bitch.\"</p><p>He pulled away from me and I looked back at my sister stumbling down the lawn.</p><p>\u201cShane, are you out here? Who\u2019s that bitch with you?\u201d</p><p>She was drunk already. I glared at her, judging her the entire time. \u201cIt\u2019s me, you idiot.\u201d I spoke clearly so she could catch every inch of my annoyance.</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s just you\u2014dear God, Aimes, you scared the shit out of me. I thought some hooker was out here trying to steal my man.\u201d She plopped down on the grass, as ungracefully as was possible.</p><p>\"We need more snacks and drinks. I don\u2019t know where they are.\" she spoke lazily as she nearly landed right on me.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice sitting in the quiet with you, Shane. See you guys inside.\u201d I stood up and left them. My face was on fire from the near kiss.</p><p>I looked back to see him watching me go. He looked like he wanted to say something, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, Alise pushed his arm and giggled about something.</p><p>I could hear the arguing starting up as I walked along the dark grass back to the house.</p><p>I wanted to tell myself that he was probably drunk, but I knew that wasn\u2019t it. I knew Shane better than that, and he had noticed all I wore was black. I wanted to tell myself not to be excited, not to get my hopes up in any way. But my hopes were already through the moon.</p><p>Blake was standing at the back door, looking out at the backyard. I knew he was looking for me. I felt guilty that he might have seen the almost kiss in the grass.</p><p>I ducked along the hedge and crept to the other side of the house. I slipped in the front door and got lost in the crowd.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t ready to go back to normal yet. I was full of mixed emotions that I needed to analyze alone with Jane Austen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fought my way through the hallways surrounded by noise and teenagers acting crazy. The house was so full, I couldn\u2019t even place faces anymore; it was a sea of teens getting trashed. I knew everyone in the house in one way or another, but it was so crowded their faces seemed to blend together.</p><p>I walked up the stairs in the family room to the bedrooms. I sat in the hallway on the carpet against the wall, feeling the house vibrate from the music. I was grateful no one was there. I needed to mull over things.</p><p>Giselle interrupted my peace. She walked up the stairs, smiling when I saw her.</p> <p>\u201cHey girl, you\u2019re just the person I wanted to see. I have a drink here, we can, like, share. Some hot guy just gave it to me. He looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t see his face properly. It's yummy. It's, like, way too packed downstairs.\u201d She passed me the glass, thankfully, before she sat down and spilled it everywhere.</p><p>She shrugged up close. \u201cHave some lemonade, Aimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, just a bit of vodka. You need a little vodka, I think. I saw you in the living room. You looked sad.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to turn her down, but I remembered the evening I had just endured and I decided to be a rebel.</p> <p>The rebel who shared the drink. I even sucked at being rebellious.</p><p>I took a sip, feeling the warmth of the liquor burn the whole way down. For a cold drink, it burned. I smiled at her as I passed it back. \"It tastes good, but it\u2019s not really my thing. Besides, you don't know who gave it to you.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t lying. It did taste great and if it weren\u2019t for the burn, I never would have known there was even booze in it. It made me nervous that some random guy gave her a drink, and I was sharing it.</p><p>Giselle took a sip and passed the glass back. \u201cHot guys give me drinks all the time, dummy\u2014I'm hot. You need a little more than that tiny sip you had. It's like one glass for two people; you need to relax. Have fun. Boys like fun girls. I think Shane likes you. He always talks about you. You should steal him from your sister.\"</p><p>\"He talks about me?\"</p><p>She laughed. \"Yeah, all the time. It makes Alise nuts. Here, your turn.\"</p> <p>I took the drink. I was feeling lost in what she'd said, but then she started rambling again.</p><p>\"Yeah, the day they started dating he was going to ask you out, but Alise told him you were already into that yucky Blake dork.\"</p><p>My stomach tensed. I chugged back the drink. My heart was racing. Alise had stopped the one guy I had liked forever from asking me out?</p><p>\"You\u2019re not like your sister, you know. You\u2019re, like, easier to be around. She is, like, really high maintenance.\u201d The irony was that Alise would have said the same thing about Giselle. She took the drink and gulped.</p><p>I took the glass back, snatching it from her hands. I drank a few big gulps, amazed that it tasted so good.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but was able to rationalize that it was a small glass of booze between two people. I just needed something to distract me from the possible threat that my legs would get up and walk to Shane. I would kiss him on the mouth and get slapped around by my sister. In my buzzed state, I would probably kill her.</p><p>Giselle started to babble but my thoughts were stuck on Shane. I wanted to taste his lips, just once. I wanted to steal him from my sister. She had stolen him from me first.</p><p>Out of the blue, and completely without cause, my brain recalled the mystery man with the blue eyes. I laughed out loud as I started to feel a little dirty, enjoying the company of two different guys in my head.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, the most awkward thing occurred; Giselle started making sense and I liked her. I looked her straight in the face and said as matter a fact as I could, \u201cGiselle, I love you. You\u2019re so awesome. You know that my sister is a slut and she stole Shane from me first.\u201d I knew then that I was drunk. I didn\u2019t know what the feeling was until the word awesome left my mouth, followed by a giggle. I was thinking about boys with no shirts on and giggling with Giselle. How had it happened? I started to panic but felt like I could do nothing about it.</p><p>She laughed and pointed at me. \"I know, right? She is a bad person, Aimes.\" Her face was really serious. I watched her mouth and started to laugh again.</p><p>It got progressively worse, even though we had only drunk the one glass of lemonade, as far as I knew. After a while, I found myself slipping down the wall, laughing. I was unable to push myself back up to sitting. Giselle lay down beside me and I tried to talk, but my mouth couldn\u2019t make words anymore.</p><p>Then noises and pictures came in fuzzy flashes. I saw my sister laughing. Giselle was being carried away. I saw Blake standing alone in the hallway. Then Alise came into my view. I could see them talking, but then my sister grabbed Blake\u2019s face and started to kiss him. Blake grabbed her back and pulled her up into him. They were making out, and as luck would have it, my eyes were stuck open. For some reason, I couldn\u2019t get my eyes to shut; they ignored my brain. I watched the painful moment while drooling on myself and unable to control my body. I heard a voice. It made them stop, and Alise went down the stairs, leaving me with Blake. He brushed my hair from my face and smiled. He said something I couldn\u2019t catch and my eyes shut.</p><p>When they opened next, I felt light, like I was floating. There was no sound whatsoever. The music was gone, but I was still in the hallway.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t lying on the floor anymore. I turned around and saw a figure slumped on the floor. I grimaced at her hideous pink shirt. She looked sick. I reached for her but my hand went through the girl\u2019s body, like mist.</p><p>I looked closer and realized that I was the girl on the floor.</p><p>I was the corpse girl on the floor turning blue.</p><p>I panicked.</p><p>I screamed, but no sound came from my mouth.</p><p>I tried to bang the walls. Where was everyone?</p><p>My face turned grey. I looked closer at the pile of what appeared to be vomit by my lips. My body was choking\u2014where were the idiots who had left me in the hallway to die?</p><p>I turned back around to find someone with me. I jumped up and down and screamed, but he didn\u2019t hear me. I smiled when I realized it was Wade from Port Handley. He knelt beside my body. Then he did something I definitely had never fantasized about, when I saw his face the first time. He stuck his fingers into my throat and started fishing around in there.</p><p>I scowled, watching a strange guy root around in my mouth, and tried not to think about the sanitary issues. I needed to remember to, at the very least, rinse with mouthwash when I woke from my nightmare. His hands were huge. They were stretching my mouth.</p><p>Wade looked at me, his piercing blue eyes wide. He looked scared and his mouth moved but I heard nothing.</p><p>I turned and looked behind me but no one was there. Was he able to see me? I waved my arms back and forth and he waved me over to him. He put his hand into my mouth again, and this time my body heaved and shook, as piles of vomit started to pour out in front of me.</p><p>It was like the exorcist, and I was barfing all over the hottest guy I had ever seen. His eyes were panicked as he pointed to my body again. I took a step forward and everything went dark. When I saw light again, I felt instant pain. I wasn\u2019t floating any longer. I was drowning. My body convulsed as I fought, coughing and heaving repeatedly.</p><p>My world spun. I reached my hand out and wiped my mouth off. I was on the floor and everything hurt in ways I didn\u2019t know were possible.</p><p>Wade from Port Handley spoke, \u201cWelcome back, Aimee. You scared the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>I was excited Wade knew my name. He was so handsome. The smell of my vomit was more than I could bear. I heaved again and threw up some more.</p><p>\"You're Wade.\"</p><p>He looked puzzled. \u201cNext time chew the veggie burger all the way through, ok?\u201d He picked me up off the floor. \u201cLet\u2019s get you cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>He lifted me like a princess. I laid my face against his chest and felt like I was floating. I sniffed his neck. He smelled amazing. I smelled like barf.</p><p>He carried me to the bathroom but in the mirror he wasn\u2019t there\u2014my reflection was, but his was missing.</p><p>I closed my eyes and pressed really hard, but when I opened them, he was still gone.</p><p>He smiled and laughed. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re dreaming. Weird things happen in dreams, like people having no reflection.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need a reflection to be perfect.</p><p>Pain was everywhere. Everything was burning and hurting. My skin ached and my head pounded.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move my head properly; something was in the way.</p><p>I twitched open one eye letting in the light. It made everything burn much worse. I winced as my eye opened completely, seeing a strange room.</p><p>Instantly assuming I was at Wade\u2019s house, I felt nervous.</p><p>Who was Wade and why would he take me to his house?</p><p>I opened my other eye, feeling sick.</p><p>My mouth tasted like I might have already been sick. I tried to think about where I had been, but all I remembered was Wade from Port Handley.</p><p>Straining, I reached a hand above my head and felt the towel still wrapped on my head. I pulled at it, trying to get it off, but I couldn\u2019t. It was folded in a bizarre way I had never folded a towel. Giving up on the towel, I looked around the room.</p><p>It was small, with a queen bed and floral print everywhere. It screamed guest room in every way. I lifted the covers to reveal my naked body and blushed. I hoped I had gotten into bed on my own. There was a water glass on the right bedside table. I knew instantly it was someone else\u2019s. I always put my glass of water on the left. Fear and panic started to mix with my already-fragile mind. Had someone else slept with me? Had Wade abducted me from somewhere? His face and name were the only memories I had.</p><p>Using every inch of strength, I sat up, wrapping myself with the sheet and looked for clothes. I fought the urge to scream or pass out again. My clothes were nowhere to be found.</p><p>I took a breath and tried to remember what they had told us in defense class.</p><p>Nothing came up that seemed like it would apply to the moment.</p><p>I pulled the towel off after some work. It reminded me of the way African women folded their headdresses. My hair was still wet, of course. Long, thick hair would never dry in a towel, which was why I would never fall asleep with one on my head. It fell around my face in a ball of unconditioned mats. Someone else put me to bed. Someone else washed my hair and never conditioned it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pulling the sheet tighter to cover myself, I realized my ring was gone. My mom\u2019s ring wasn't on my right hand. I showered, slept, and lived in that ring from the day my mom died. I had cleaned the blood off of it myself.</p><p>The door creaked open and Alise peeked her head through the crack. I wanted to cry with joy, but I figured I would probably get sick if I did.</p><p>She looked anxious as she walked in. \u201cOh my God\u2014you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p> <p>I put a hand up to stop her. \u201cNo. Not okay. No shouting at me.\u201d</p><p>With a disturbed expression, she asked, \u201cWhat do you remember? Do you remember being at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\" I shook. \"You wanted me to drop you off at Shane\u2019s house. I remember that guy, Wade.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cThat was two days ago. Giselle's in the hospital. Aimee, we think someone drugged you guys.\u201d She sat on the bed beside me, rubbing my arms. Her hand felt like razor blades dragging up my skin. I shivered in pain and sickness.</p><p>\u201cWe need to take you there now. You\u2019ve been throwing up all night.\u201d She put an arm under me to help me stand. \u201cI need to get you in a robe at least, ok?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. I needed a hospital. I felt sick in a way I had never felt.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I asked still foggy on everything.</p><p>\u201cBlake?\u201d Alise asked, blushing.</p><p>\u201cNo, Wade. Wade with the eyes. Wade from Port Handley.\u201d</p><p>Alise frowned. \u201cYou remember Wade?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe helped me, I think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been gone for a while, Aimes. I think maybe you\u2019re confused. Ready?\u201d she asked pulling at me.</p><p>I nodded. She got me standing and dressed, with only a minor amount of pain everywhere. I wondered what Giselle had to do with me being poisoned. I didn\u2019t like Giselle.</p><p>Shane walked into the room, smiling at me. \u201cHey, Aimee, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand what was happening in any way. I was with my sister and Shane.</p><p>I looked at my sister. \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did anything, I swear.\u201d Her eyes looked funny. She did something. I could see the guilt. She poisoned me.</p><p>I felt the room moving like a choppy ocean. Glimpses rolled back into my mind. I looked at Shane and winced, remembering some parts of the evening. I shook my head, swaying back and forth. \u201cI got sick in your hallway. I\u2019m so sorry, Shane.\u201d My words were thick in my mouth.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, don\u2019t be sorry. I\u2019m the one who should be sorry. I obviously have friends who are sleazy bastards. Someone did this to you guys, in my house. I will find out who it was. Right now, though, I\u2019m going to carry you to the truck, okay?\u201d His sweet face was truly and genuinely distressed. I wanted to rub it with my hand, but I couldn\u2019t move my arms.</p> <p>He picked me up carefully, so as not to jostle me. \u201cWow, you are way lighter than Alise.\u201d He snickered as he said it and Alise smacked the back of his head. \u201cOw\u2014easy, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it in a bad way.\u201d He carried me down the stairs like I was air. It was familiar to me. Something about it was creepily similar in my mind. I remembered something about me being carried on his stairs.</p><p>My dad was in the truck; he looked pissed. We called it his 'stress face' and it wasn\u2019t a pretty picture. He got out when he saw us and opened the passenger door, so Shane could lay me inside.</p><p>\u201cAimee, are you okay?\u201d He looked terrified.</p><p>\u201cNeed doctor,\" I muttered.</p><p>He frowned at Shane. \u201cYou, young man, are going to stay away from both of my daughters for good.\u201d He swung around to look at Alise with a burning hate in his eyes. \u201cYou did this to her; you conned her into coming to this when you know she isn\u2019t like you. You get home now and don\u2019t leave your bedroom for a month, GO!\u201d he screamed, tearing my head apart.</p><p>When Alise looked at me, I saw an apologetic look I had never seen on her face. My sister was ashamed.</p><p>I would have defended them both, but I was too feeble. Shane handed me the bowl that had been on the ground beside the truck. \u201cIn case you get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered again, drooling a little.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cFeel better, Aimee.\u201d He kissed my sweaty forehead.</p><p>My dad got in the truck, slamming the door, again ripping my head apart. I groaned in agony as Shane closed my door softly. My dad never spoke the whole way. He was seething and it was better for my head if he didn\u2019t talk. I threw up twice in the bowl on the way, mostly it was heaving and spitting. I had never felt that sick in my life, even with food poisoning.</p><p>My dad nearly cried when he explained that the girl who was still not awake had shared her drinks with me all night.</p><p>The nurse scowled at me, like I was one of those partying reckless teenagers who had burdened her dad with this.</p><p>I was put on an IV and given some Gravol to make me sleep.</p><p>I had weird dreams.</p><p>Wade was in them, and my mom. My mom kissed me on the forehead and put her hands over my eyes. I could hear people talking. They were arguing. Wade was beside me, whispering to me that everything was going to be okay. I finally got my mom\u2019s hands off my eyes and I could see people kissing. It hurt me to see it, but I didn\u2019t understand why. Wade stood between the kissing people and me and shook his head. He blew me a kiss and I woke up alone.</p><p>I was groggy, but at least I knew where I was. I was tired and cold. I fell back into a dreamless sleep.</p><p>I thought I was still dreaming when I heard talking in the empty black space that had become my brain. \u201cAre there any effects of this on her body that we should be prepared for?\u201d My dad\u2019s voice sounded exhausted.</p><p>\u201cYes, she will need to be very careful for the next couple months. This is a serious thing. The level of the drugs we found in her system was very high,\u201d a lady spoke. I opened one of my eyes to see the light of day without the intense pain. I felt remarkably better and quite hungry.</p><p>I looked around me to see my dad and a lady doctor standing in the hallway, just outside my door.</p><p>Shane was on the chair beside my bed, passed out. He looked so peaceful, but his being in my room was freaking me out. Why would my sister's boyfriend be in my room, and where was my sister? I looked around for Alise, but didn\u2019t see her anywhere. I knew she must be around somewhere if Shane was with me. Where was Blake? He never left me. Ever.</p><p>I pushed the button to raise my bed to a sitting position. The feeling of movement gave me a head rush. It was nothing compared to the ones I had had the day before, when my dad had checked me in. I recalled very little beyond the sick feeling.</p><p>Shane stirred and opened one of his eyes. He yawned and smiled at me. His smile made me happy; I smiled back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake now. Thank God. I guess that means you\u2019re out of the danger zone,\u201d he whispered, stretching on the recliner chair. He stood and put a hand on my head. He bent his face and kissed my forehead. I didn\u2019t have a reaction for it. I froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Giselle were given some crazy homemade date-rape drug. You saved Giselle\u2019s life by drinking half of the glass. She\u2019s still out. No sign of her waking up anytime soon either, and with these things, apparently the longer you sleep the worse it is.\u201d He looked at the doctor and pointed in my direction, through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here for five days, in and out of sleep. Giselle isn\u2019t even stirring, the doctor said she has brain activity but she isn\u2019t waking. They are transporting her to Children's in the city, tomorrow I think.\"</p><p>I covered my eyes and thought for a moment. \"What? What drug? Giselle? What?\"</p><p>He brushed hair from my face. He was touching me and standing so close, I could feel the warmth of him. He spoke softly, \"We found you guys upstairs...each in a pile of puke, Aimes.\"</p><p>I had stopped listening when he had said my nickname, Aimes. I liked it when he called me that. I didn\u2019t understand why he was with me. I tried to be cool and stay engaged.</p><p>I blushed, remembering his spare room. \u201cHow did I get to bed at your house? I remember that I woke up naked.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. While we were getting Giselle in the ambulance and everything, we left you upstairs. We came back and you were in bed and there was a giant pile of vomit at the top of the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWade helped me.\u201d The memory flitted through my mind.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, Wade was gone, long before this happened. His girlfriend freaked on him for talking to your sister, and she made him leave. I was right there. You got yourself cleaned up, before the drug hit too hard.\u201d</p><p>\"He was there. I saw him.\" I remembered Wade\u2014I remembered him carrying me. I wasn\u2019t wrong. What if Wade had done things to me while I slept? \u201cMy ring is gone.\u201d I held my hand out, trying not to think about Wade potentially date raping me.</p><p>He reached into his pocket. \u201cI found it in the pile of vomit\u2014well on top. It was shiny and clean but sitting at the top of the pile. I grabbed it and washed it for you. I know how important it is to you. It was your mom's, right?\u201d He passed it to me. I put it on and tried to ignore that it slid on too easily. I had clearly lost more weight.</p><p>I blushed. \u201cHow do you know it\u2019s important to me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI pay more attention than you\u2019d imagine, Aimee.\u201d</p><p>I felt the heat in my face getting stronger.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you have color again.\u201d</p><p>Unsure where the conversation was going, I looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Alise?\u201d</p><p>He blushed. \u201cNot sure. With Blake maybe. What do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a haze right now. Mostly I remember Wade.\u201d I lay back down on the bed, feeling ready for some more sleep. His words came crashing back at me and I shot up thinking out loud. \u201cWhy is she with Blake?\u201d My head spun.</p><p>He looked preoccupied and lost in my question. \u201cI think it's Blake and Alise\u2019s job to tell you about what happened with them.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, wondering why he hadn\u2019t answered me. The doctor and my dad came into the room, before I could ask more questions. I wanted the answer to my question, but my eyes got so heavy. I blinked and Shane was gone from the room, no doubt giving the doctor some space to check my vitals. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re awake?\u201d The doctor put her cold hands on my wrist to check my pulse.</p><p>\u201cBarely. I think I need more sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, a few days maybe and you can go home. Right now though, we need to keep you for observation. You\u2019re a very lucky girl.\u201d Her tone was annoying.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel lucky. I went to my first party ever and was drugged. Not so lucky, I think.\u201d I kept my eyes closed. They were too heavy to try to lift.</p><p>My dad grabbed my hand and squeezed it tightly. \u201cWell, the important thing is that you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>I pried open my eyes. \u201cDad, you can\u2019t blame Alise for this. It wasn\u2019t her fault at all. I wanted to go to the party. Or Shane, he\u2019s a very nice guy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI apologized to her\u2014don\u2019t worry. I was just so mad. I know Shane's a good guy. He's been here everyday. He sleeps and eats here. I\u2019ve asked him, your sister, and Blake to try to help out. I want them to find out who did this to you. You kids will hear more than the adults will.\u201d</p><p>There it was again\u2014Alise and Blake in the same sentence. I knew that I wouldn\u2019t get any answers from my dad, so I closed my eyes and thought about who would want to drug Giselle. The list was endless. She was beautiful and fairly dumb. The combination would be hard to resist. I had never been friends with her. Undoubtedly, something had to have happened to make me even consider drinking, not only with her, but in general.</p> <p>The list would have to consist of who would date rape someone. In my sister's group of friends, again, I felt the list was endless. She had friends who had been creepy when we had been in kindergarten. Senior year, they were serial killers waiting to strike. Then again, I was biased. They had all been mean to me on more than one occasion.</p><p>No one from my nerd table came to mind. All of them would have the capability and intelligence needed to make a homemade date-rape drug, but none of them would have done it.</p><p>Slowly but surely, the doctor and my dad left, and I was alone to drift off to sleep again.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Friends and foes</p><p>\u201cAimee.\u201d</p> <p>I opened my eyes but no one was there.</p><p>I sat up, looking around. My stomach hurt. Thankfully, my pounding heart seemed to be supplying me with the energy.</p><p>\u201cAimee,\u201d the woman called me again. I was pretty sure it was Giselle\u2019s voice.</p><p>I lowered my bed and stepped off gingerly, hoping I wouldn\u2019t fall and reveal the opening in the back of the gown. Hospitals really were cruel with their open-backed gowns.</p><p>I started to walk from the room, not noticing the IV. I made it two steps, before I felt the stab of the moving needle. I stepped back and leaned against the machine. My hand burned where the needle went into it. I closed my eyes for a few seconds to let the throbbing stop.</p><p>I grabbed the IV machine and started my slow progression down the hall, in search of Giselle\u2019s room. I didn\u2019t know which room she was in, but there were only so many. My body ached and the IV machine didn\u2019t seem happy about the trek either.</p><p>I saw her through the door as I walked past the rooms peeking in. She was lying in her bed, blinking. I grimaced, remembering the feeling of waking and not knowing what had happened. No one was in her room, but it looked like the gardener had been by. Every shelf, and even the windowsills, was full of flowers. I didn\u2019t have a single flower.</p><p>I smiled at her as I crept into the room. \u201cHey Giselle,\u201d I whispered. I didn\u2019t really need to whisper. If anyone had been within earshot, they would have heard the loud squeak from my IV cart.</p> <p>She turned her head, looking bewildered. Her eyes looked frightened. \u201cAimee, you\u2019re here. I knew you were here. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone got us good. We will both be here for a bit longer. This is my first time walking in almost a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were here. I saw you. You held my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, maybe Alise came by to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she spoke as if her mouth were dry. I pushed the button to bring her to a slight incline and sat on the end of her bed.</p><p>\"What happened?\" She looked frightened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Everyone says we were drinking together and then we were throwing up. They brought you here right away, I think, and me in the early hours of the morning. They tested us and we have some crazy date-rape drug in our systems. They think someone did this to us on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Her frightened look grew in intensity. \u201cWho would do that?\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together and furrowed my brow. \u201cThat\u2019s just it, no one knows. The party had to have over a hundred people at it. People from all the close-by schools and whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have we been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, six days\u2014me, five. I spent the first night at Shane\u2019s house.\" I blushed as I thought about it. \u201cGiselle, don\u2019t tell anyone, but I know I didn\u2019t put myself to bed. I was naked when I woke, and clean. I\u2019m scared someone did something and then cleaned me up. But I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>She looked disgusted. \u201cWhat is wrong with people? Dude, I hate to tell you this, but you need to get the nurse to do a check. She can check and make sure you\u2019re still a virgin. I have to say, though, like, if you weren\u2019t a virgin anymore, you would be sore down there. I was like super sore when I lost mine.\u201d She looked up at the ceiling and sighed.</p><p>I sighed looking down at her arm where the IV was poking in. \u201cI wish my mom was here.\u201d I hadn\u2019t said those words in a long time. The moment seemed harder than all the others I had been through. It felt hopeless and out of control. I felt as if I was at the end of my rope and ready to just let go and fall.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her confused. \u201cWhere is your mom?\u201d</p><p>She trembled a tiny bit, as her lower lip quivered and a small tear left her right eye. \u201cShe, like, left. A month ago, she just packed everything and left. My dad doesn\u2019t know what to do with his life without her. He works, like non-stop. He doesn\u2019t come home sometimes, just sleeps, like, at the office.\u201d</p><p>I put my IV-free hand out on the blankets. \u201cGiselle, I am so sorry. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo one does. She told us she was going to visit her sister, but she just left. Dad has one credit card he can track her with. I guess she\u2019s been in Mexico for a week, paying for two people. My dad is a mess.\u201d</p><p>I bowed my head and nodded weakly. \u201cMy dad isn\u2019t taking mom's death any better. I don\u2019t think any of us are. My family is a mess too.\u201d</p><p>Giselle looked at me, and her huge eyes glistened. Her long, silky black hair framed her perfect oval face. Her skin was an olive color, with naturally pink full lips and eyes so dark the pupils were not visible. Even heartbroken and horribly sick, she was stunning.</p><p>\u201cWe have each other, it seems.\u201d She gripped the hand I had given her.</p><p>\"Yeah, I'm just down the hall. If I can make it back there.\" I pressed the button for the nurse. She came running in, breathless.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank Heaven, you girls are both awake.\u201d She looked at Giselle specifically. \u201cHow are you feeling, sweetie?\u201d She put the tools to work and checked Giselle\u2019s vitals.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I was wondering if we could share a room.\u201d</p><p>The nurse nodded at us. \u201cI\u2019ll have your stuff moved over right away. I can\u2019t believe you walked all that way, Hun; it\u2019s a long ways for a sick kid.\u201d</p><p>I patted my trusty IV cart. \u201cIt helped me the whole way.\u201d</p><p>The nurse laughed at me and shook her head.</p><p>Before we knew it, we were sharing a room and Giselle was regaling me with tales of boys and shopping discounts. There was no more sad talk about moms and dads or boys who like to drug girls.</p><p>I listened, happy to be distracted by simple things that really had no bearing on my world.</p><p>Normally, I liked to surround myself with intelligent people who only talked when important or interesting things were to be said. In that moment, a story of drinking while in Cuba and a few helpful hints about strange Cuban men were extremely entertaining.</p><p>In the midst of our peaceful afternoon nap, I heard her before I saw her. It was always the case.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re sharing a room?\u201d my sister asked rudely, also always the case.</p><p>I opened my eyes to see the nurse talking to my sister and dad, just outside our room.</p><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re scared. They\u2019ve had something horrid happen to them and they\u2019re alone here, except for each other.\u201d The nurse let my sister know she could be a snotty bitch too, but with a smile and actual authority.</p><p>My dad smiled at the young nurse. \u201cRight. Of course. Thank you. I think we should just see if they\u2019re awake then.\u201d</p><p>I grinned as his face lit up at seeing mine.</p><p>\u201cYou have color and your eyes look clear again. How are you feeling, kiddo?\u201d he asked, sitting on the end of my bed.</p><p>I nodded, feeling sick for him and what he had been through in one year.</p><p>My sister looked odd, uneasy. I frowned at Alise, but answered my dad, \u201cGood. We both seem to be coming around. I\u2019m ready to get out of here, though. The nurse said tomorrow, if the liver tests come back normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour liver?\u201d my sister asked, looking like she might throw up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, did you even show up for bio? The liver is the filter for the blood. Drugs and alcohol are filtered through the liver. That\u2019s why underage drinking is so bad. You\u2019re damaging a developing liver.\u201d</p><p>My dad laughed. \u201cWell, good to see you\u2019re feeling like yourself again. We\u2019ll come back tonight with some food if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d love something I can eat. Maybe bring Giselle something. Her dad has been busy lately.\u201d</p><p>Alise rolled her eyes at the comment, which angered me in ways I couldn\u2019t describe. I felt unreasonably angry with Alise. I literally had to count backwards from ten to stop myself from lashing out at her, or throwing something at the very least.</p><p>She looked apprehensively at me as she asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the memory coming?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I furrowed my brow. Alise was up to something. \u201cGood\u2014I\u2019m remembering little bits more and more every day.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, even though it was obvious that the news made her uneasy. \u201cOh, good.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cDid you poison us, Alise? You\u2019re being weird.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head violently.</p><p>Dad looked at her suspiciously. \u201cAlise, I agree you\u2019re acting very odd. This is the moment to confess if you know anything about this, even if it was a joke.\u201d</p><p>She started to cry. \u201cI never did this to you, Aimes.\u201d</p><p>I was taken aback; she barely cried when our mom had died, and there she was sobbing.</p><p>Our dad grabbed her by the arms, not moved by her display. He'd seen it before. He looked deeply into her eyes, examining her. Then he nodded. He pulled her into him and stroked her head. I looked around, wondering if anyone noticed the circus I called family.</p> <p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t take things seriously, Alise. You do things so recklessly.\u201d Dad soothed her as she cried into his shoulder.</p><p>If I was being honest with myself, it wasn\u2019t a stretch for me to believe that my sister had drugged me. It would have been done innocently, to be funny.</p><p>Her face poked out of our Dad's armpit where she whispered, \u201cI kissed Blake.\u201d</p><p>My stomach lurched forward, threatening to escape my mouth. I felt a small crack in my heart as I processed the words. My sister had tainted the one guy I had always thought of as mine. Even if he wasn\u2019t my boyfriend, he was mine. He was my best friend, my rock in it all. He was there when all of the extra-crappy things that seemed to seek me out ruined my life.</p><p>I screamed, \"MINE! BLAKE IS MINE!\"</p><p>Still hiding in our dad's armpit, she cried harder. \u201cI was drunk and I never thought about what I was doing until it was too late. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes. I was desperate to push the pain down.</p><p>She had let go of our dad and knelt at my bedside. Dad looked uncomfortable. But at least Alise\u2019s guilty behavior made sense, as did Blake not being at my bedside. I felt sick for myself and Shane, who was no doubt heartbroken.</p><p>After a momentary struggle, I felt my natural instinct kick in and the bad feelings were pushed down. It was like swallowing acid.</p><p>I felt a bitterness fill me. \u201cWell, you have everything else, Alise. You have looks, friends, and everyone loves you. Every boy in school is in love with you, or her.\u201d I pointed at the sleeping Giselle. \u201cSo, I guess, why not take the one boy I thought I had.\u201d</p><p>Dad sighed, disappointed. \u201cI will leave you to apologize to your sister properly. Aimes, I love you kiddo, and I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re going to be coming home tomorrow. We will bring you something tonight to eat later. Try not to worry about boys, Aimee; your health is what's important right now.\u201d He kissed my forehead and left the room.</p><p>My sister\u2019s eyes shimmered with the tears.</p><p>She grabbed my hand desperately. \u201cI am sorry. I have never been this sorry in my whole life. It just happened, and it will never happen again. I didn\u2019t know he had been in love with me all these years.\u201d The words came spilling out before she could dam up her mouth. I watched the regret cover her face.</p><p>\"He said that?\" My heart was breaking. No wonder he was always at my house. No wonder he was always making excuses to be around us. I had thought it was me. The foolishness and pain was bubbling around inside of me.</p> <p>\"I'm so sorry. I won't ever see him again. It was a mistake.\"</p><p>I pulled my hand away from my sister and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You can\u2019t even help yourself. You ooze sex and punishment, which is something boys seem to want. I don\u2019t care what you do.\u201d</p><p>Alise nodded along, not comprehending what I said. Then something happened, something I never expected.</p><p>Alise snapped and lost it. \"I'm, like, so jealous of you. You\u2019re so smart, you\u2019re still a virgin, and you are funny in a way only... like, smart people get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitty, and I don\u2019t think the entire hospital needs to know I'm a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, you know what I mean. Aimee, you are the kind of girl that every MAN dreams of, and I am the kind of girl that every boy dreams of. This is my time to shine and it's going to be nothing compared to yours when you finally stop being, well, what you are.\u201d</p><p>It was the kindest and most loving thing my sister had ever said to me. I knew she was trying to be nice.</p><p>I should have responded back lovingly and we could have had a moment, but I was still too angry. I couldn\u2019t help myself; I was so furious, defeated, and embarrassed. \u201cYou have Shane. How could you do this to him, Alise? You've already cheated on him with every popular guy.\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand. \u201cI only dated him because it seemed like the right move, like we should be together. I honestly don\u2019t think he even likes me. He doesn\u2019t even kiss me. It's been like nine months and nothing. I get it though. His parents have a lot going on, but come on\u2014nine months and no sex. We hold hands like we're ten-years-old.\u201d</p><p>I blocked out her ramblings. I felt tears escape my eyes. I was trying so hard to rein them in, but they were rebelling and streaming down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Aimee, and when I find out who did this to you, I will make them pay.\u201d Her stare became malicious and sinister and she sounded like Batman. It was a weird moment for me.</p><p>As quickly as it had all started, it was over. Alise stood up and left my room, waving goodbye to me. I understood her less, it seemed, than I had thought. Oddly enough, I felt better from the weird moment. She truly did have a magic about her; being angry with her was near impossible.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to do about Blake. I felt betrayed, but for some reason, it felt like I knew this would happen.</p><p>I looked at Giselle, who smiled from her fake sleep. \u201cOkay, that was, like, weird.\"</p><p>\"I know, right? What was the whole 'I will make them pay.' Who does she think she is? What will she do? Whack them with a stiletto?\"</p><p>Giselle laughed. \"She is so crazy sometimes.\"</p><p>I laughed, feeling the same about it all. I felt like a truck had hit me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the nuttiness. My family has been a little freak show lately. I really didn\u2019t see that coming, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, dude, your sister has never cried in front of me, except at, like, your mom\u2019s funeral. She didn\u2019t even cry as many tears as she should have then. So, you like that Blake kid?\u201d She switched channels on me too quickly.</p><p>I nodded my head slowly. \u201cYeah, I did, and she knew it. I thought I did. It just seemed like the way things would go, a natural progression, I guess. We make sense to be together. We're both smart and easy going but passionate about things we believe in. I\u2019m a vegetarian and he doesn\u2019t eat red meat. Sort of like her and Shane, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat is the dumbest thing I've heard a smart person say. You can\u2019t make a relationship out of math and science, you weirdo. Aimee, it\u2019s safe to say that you\u2019ve never been in love. Dude, your sister is right; you will have an amazing love when you find it. You\u2019ve held out for so long, that when it happens, it\u2019s going to rock your world.\u201d I laughed more at Giselle than with her. Alise and Giselle treated me like a spinster, because I had yet to fall in love, at eighteen. They acted like I was thirty.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI think I will probably end up the lonely old Miss Havisham, with cats and craziness.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know this Havisham lady, but I doubt you will be lonely. A little makeup, some hair product, and maybe gain a little weight\u2014girl, you wait and see.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to respond. The doctor came into our room, his eyes looked off.</p><p>\u201cGirls, do you want your assessments alone or together?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Giselle and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m good with together. We're in the same boat.\u201d</p><p>Giselle agreed. \u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cNot the same boat, unfortunately, but if you want your parents here let me know now. You're both eighteen so they don\u2019t have to be here, unless you want them here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Aimee, your liver appears to be on the mend. I wouldn\u2019t recommend drinking again for a long, long time. You may not ever be able to tolerate fatty foods, drugs and alcohol ever again. But we are seeing a reduction in ALP levels and your symptoms are diminishing rapidly. We have every reason to believe, you will make a full recovery over the next few months. But very limited exercise and a lot of sleep.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m a veggie anyway and I never do drugs or drink. So, basically, live my life the way I do anyway and avoid parties. Yeah, I\u2019m good with that.\u201d I could feel the clean bill of health, just around the corner.</p><p>He smiled at me. \u201cYes, that\u2019s excellent that you\u2019re already used to this because there is some permanent damage to your liver's bile ducts. You are lucky, though, that at this point, you seem to be having some regeneration.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat again and shook his head, staring down at the floor. \u201cGiselle, your body seems to have had something we almost never see. You\u2019re going to be transported to the main Children\u2019s in Portland. You seem to have had an allergy to the drugs you were given. This is not something we see often. Your liver is reacting, like it has cirrhosis of the liver\u2014liver disease. We have found your ALP levels are very high and your direct bilirubin is normal, so we think it's a cirrhosis-type of reaction. Your symptoms are not decreasing at all. I am so sorry. Do you have any questions?\u201d</p><p>Giselle looked at him and then at me and shook her head. \u201cWhat? What does that all mean? I'm sick still? No, no this isn\u2019t right. Your tests are wrong. I feel fine.\u201d Tears sprang from her eyes and then mine.</p><p>\u201cGiselle, it means your body needs a larger center with better care than we can provide. We are heli-transporting you within the hour to Children\u2019s, because we want those tests to be wrong. I have left messages at your home, but no one has returned the calls. Are your parents away? We haven\u2019t been able to reach anyone for you. Your friends handed in your medical information from your purse when they checked you in, but no one is answering the numbers we have on record.\u201d His voice was soft. The news was so bleak it bothered the heartless doctor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked at Giselle, ignoring him. \u201cThis is good news because they already know what\u2019s wrong with you and how to treat it. You\u2019re going to the best hospital. They will find answers, and I\u2019ll find you mom if it kills me, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but I could see she was shut off. She was trapped in the doctor\u2019s first sentence.</p><p>I looked at the doctor; I needed my cell phone and for him to go away. \u201cI will talk to her.\u201d</p> <p>He agreed with a head nod and walked from the room.</p><p>I sprang from my bed like a sloth and started my emergency texting. I messaged my sister.</p><p>\u201cDude, get G\u2019s dad here 911\u201d</p><p>Clearly not understanding, she texted me back.</p><p>\u201c???\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo time 2 talk get her dad he\u2019s sleeping @ work. Tell him 2 bring the visa bill with the resort name on it his wife is staying @\u201d</p><p>\u201c??OK??\u201d</p><p>\u201cU HAVE 10 MIN 2 B Here\u201d</p><p>\u201cKK\u201d</p><p>Then I sent Blake a message.</p><p>\u201cU :* my sis??\u201d</p> <p>He messaged me back instantly.</p><p>\u201c&lt;/3 Sooooo Sorry\u201d</p><p>His broken heart meant nothing, I decided. I turned my phone off. At least he never knew I liked him.</p><p>I looked back at Giselle, who was sitting up, staring blankly at the bed. I turned my phone back on and ignored the messages I was receiving from Blake. I Googled, liver disease. Not that I needed to, I could have told her everything she needed to know. Sometimes reading made people feel better; it did me anyway. I read for about half an hour, looking for a bright side. I didn\u2019t find one. I decided not to share my findings. Or focus on them.</p><p>From the article, it looked like we had drug-induced Cholestasis, which was likely to last a month or so in a worst-case scenario. In Giselle\u2019s case, an allergic reaction triggered the worst worst-case scenario, which looked like an acute case of hepatitis.</p><p>I looked at her. \u201cThis is going to be treatable at the hospital. In the city, they have resources we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Giselle smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d The look in her eyes was killing me.</p><p>She seemed to be coming to terms very quickly with her situation, which saddened me. Giselle should be screaming and having a fit, but she seemed to be used to disappointment. It was not how I would have imagined her.</p> <p>I saw Giselle's dad rushing for our room in his rumpled suit. My sister was hot on his heels. \u201cOh my God, Giselle\u2014oh my God. Baby, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He knelt at her bedside, crying. It disgusted me to see him. She was comforting him. Giselle had the most selfish parents I had ever seen.</p><p>I got up from my bed and left them alone. The doctor stormed into the room; he looked very angry with Giselle\u2019s dad. Evidently, leaving your eighteen-year-old to cope with liver disease alone was not cool, even to doctors with no bedside manner.</p><p>I dragged my IV machine, squeaking the whole way to where my sister stood. She was holding the piece of paper I had asked for.</p><p>\u201cHe gave it to you?\u201d I asked, looking at the visa bill.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYeah, I told him about Giselle being sick and the hospital trying to reach him. He's been drunk in Handley for three days, and before that in Portland on business. He went home a few times, but never checked the messages. He just thought she was out with friends. He's a douche.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, taking the visa statement. \u201cWhat an idiot.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the charge on the visa; \u201cGrand PLDM White Sds Rst, $3200.00\u201d. I punched the code into Google with the word Mexico in front.</p><p>I felt like Nancy Drew. \u201cHa, look at that\u2014Grand Palladium White Sands Resort in the Mayan Riviera. There is a number here.\u201d I dialed, feeling hopeful.</p><p>The lady on the other line spoke quickly and I smiled and spoke back to her in fluent Spanish.</p><p>I hung up the phone as my sister crossed her arms. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her that I needed Pilar to come home, that her daughter was being taken to Children\u2019s and was very sick. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>I looked into the room to see Giselle\u2019s dad talking with the doctor and nodding his head with a blank stare. He understood what he was being told, but didn\u2019t comprehend what it meant.</p><p>Giselle looked off out the window. It troubled me to see her like this\u2014my new friend who I had known my whole life.</p><p>The stretcher came for her while we were in the hallway. The helicopter had arrived to transport her. Giselle\u2019s dad kissed her hand and ran from the hospital.</p><p>I walked back into the room as they were strapping her in for the ride. \u201cI\u2019ll get my dad to let me come see you next week when you\u2019re settled in. Text me when you get there, ok?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSee you soon then. My dad is going to drive to the hospital now.\u201d</p><p>I hugged her and felt her hands grip onto me intensely. \u201cBe strong, ok?\u201d I whispered into her ear.</p><p>She nodded and the doctors took her away. My sister waved to her from the hall and blew her a kiss as they passed by. Giselle blew her a kiss back, but looked for me to wave once more.</p><p>One more night in the hospital wasn\u2019t so bad, but it would be completely alone. Not an exciting notion.</p><p>\u201cSo what exactly is going on, Aimes? What\u2019s wrong with Giselle?\u201d My sister stood beside me, watching where Giselle had left.</p><p>\u201cThe drug that we took was poorly made, to say the least, and almost killed us. But apparently, in rare cases, an allergic reaction can occur causing an inflammation\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alise held her hands up, cutting me off. \u201cWhoa, dumb it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has the beginning stages of liver disease, which can lead to liver failure, and in some people, can lead to death.\u201d</p><p>My sister opened her mouth in understanding. \u201cOhhhh, okay. So why didn\u2019t that happen to you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHer reaction was an allergic reaction. We both reacted to the drug, but she is allergic to what is in the drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got lucky.\u201d Alise plainly wasn\u2019t getting the fact that, no matter what, I never would have had the reaction Giselle did. The fact that I clearly wasn\u2019t allergic to the drugs we took was too foreign for her.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah, and Giselle got unlucky.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes talking to Alise cheered me up, like watching a chimp in heels walk around in lipstick.</p><p>\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d Alise looked concerned. These were new expressions for her. She was lost on how to make them perfect. Instead, she looked a little constipated.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYeah, in a month or so the damage to my liver should be healed, but just in case, I can\u2019t drink, eat red meat or fatty foods, or do drugs.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSo, just go back to boring old you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sleep, math club, chess club and homework. All that clean living you refuse to attempt.\u201d</p><p>Alise wrinkled her nose and leapt on me. \u201cNo way\u2014too boring.\u201d Her abrupt and sudden hug scared me. She pulled back just as quickly. \u201cOkay, well I have to go to Shane\u2019s house and break up with him, before he finds out I kissed Blake. I know Giselle heard everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think she is texting your friends right now to tell them that; she has a lot on her mind.\u201d</p><p>Her silver eyes sparkled. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the real Giselle, only the sick Giselle. They are different people. See you later, gator.\u201d She walked out clicking on the shiny, industrial flooring in her high-heeled boots, which came over her knees.</p><p>\u201cJulia Roberts wants her boots back,\u201d I shouted at her.</p><p>She laughed, throwing her head back and waved backwards without looking, and I was alone.</p><p>I sat on my bed and thought about the last week. Where had it gone? I felt the warm wind as the papers beside my bed rustled. I looked around. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t smell her and I couldn\u2019t see her, but I knew she was there. I let the wind wrap around me. \u201cI didn\u2019t forget about you, Mom. It\u2019s just been a rough week,\u201d I whispered to the room.</p><p>The wind was gone, as quickly as it had hit. I lay back on the bed and felt my eyes start to droop.</p><p>They fluttered a few times, but the wind came back. It tickled across my bare arms and cheeks. I lazily lifted one eyelid. The bright, white-blue eyes were all I saw. The corners of my mouth lifted. \"You came back.\"</p><p>\"You can see me? Even though you're dreaming?\" his voice was a deep whisper.</p><p>I lifted my lid again and nodded. \"Of course I can, silly.\"</p><p>The warm wind floated over me. I reached a hand out. The warmth I touched made me freeze. He was real. He was really there. My heart started to pound. Both eyes opened. \"Did you come back to finish me off?\" I whispered, terrified.</p><p>He looked crushed. I couldn\u2019t help but stare at his beautiful lips. \"No. Of course not. Why would you say that?\"</p><p>My hand gripped the back of his. \"Did you drug me?\"</p><p>He frowned. \"What? No. I'm not real, Aimee. I'm a figment of your imagination.\"</p><p>The warmth in my hand proved he was there, until he wasn\u2019t. He was gone. I clenched my hand. My palm was still warm from touching him. I looked around the room. He wasn't there. Had he really been there? I heard footsteps. My insides clenched, until I saw it was Blake walking through the doorway. His face was a mask of shame. I hoped he would wear it for a while, even if I were grateful it was him.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He sat on the chair across the room from me. \u201cWhere's Giselle?\u201d he asked looking at her now-empty bed.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not good. She had an allergic reaction to the drugs.\u201d His eyes grew wide as I explained the whole situation with Giselle and her dad and mom. We talked like things had never changed, but they had, and I saw him in a new light, one I didn\u2019t know how to feel about.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Beautiful boys everywhere... oh, and a stalker.</p><p>My room hadn\u2019t changed in a week, but I felt like a stranger in it. The walls were exactly the same, but they felt closer around me. The experiences I had been through in such a short amount of time seemed to have shifted my mind. As if it narrowed in some aspects, but broadened in others. Giselle was a new addition to my life. Instead of being besties with my sister, she seemed to prefer my company. It was weird for me; I didn\u2019t even know how to work the change into my day-to-day. The text messages were coming every few minutes. It really was no wonder that Alise was so stupid. She had friend\u2019s texting her hundreds of text messages consisting of garbled English 24/7. She didn\u2019t have time to do anything but underachieve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sat on my bed, feeling more alone than I ever had. I decided to take a walk and go see my mom.</p><p>My dad was in the kitchen getting a glass of water, and he seemed to be humming. I stopped on the stairs listening to him hum. I didn\u2019t know the song, but I knew this was the first time I had heard my dad hum in eight months. I crept to the front door, as quietly as I was able, and stepped out the door. I wanted him to stay lost in whatever happy moment he was having. I sent him a quick text and headed off down the sidewalk. The town didn\u2019t look different and yet it was. The smallness of it was stifling before I was drugged. I didn\u2019t feel that way anymore. I liked the coziness. I liked knowing everyone. I missed Blake.</p><p>I walked and thought about the past year, and all the events that had shaped the time for me. I never noticed the trees or the road, just the seconds that fit together to make a year. Each of them seemed so different and complex, like a spider web. Some were horrid and others were unexplainable.</p> <p>I looked around and realized that I had long passed my mom\u2019s spot.</p><p>I was about to turn back when I saw him. He walked along the side of the road and disappeared into the thick woods. His tall, strong body would have been unmistakable in itself, but his face was one of a kind. I couldn\u2019t see his eyes but I remembered what they looked like. My heart fluttered. I should have been afraid of him but it seemed I couldn\u2019t make myself. I vaguely remembered the weird dream I'd had in the hospital, where he had vanished.</p><p>I almost chickened out, but then I just did it. \u201cWade,\u201d I called out.</p><p>He never came back.</p><p>\u201cWade, wait up. It\u2019s me, Aimee, from the party the other night. Wade.\u201d I tried to run to where he had been but my side hurt. I got an instant cramp right where my liver was located. I decided running would take me a little longer to be able to attempt.</p> <p>I walked into the dark woods, pushing myself past the initial thick and impassable brush. The bushes scratched me and pulled at my clothes and hair. I was determined to see him again. When I got inside the forest, I looked around but saw nothing. I stood perfectly still, feeling my heartbeat intensify as several possible outcomes sped through my mind.</p><p>Possibility number one\u2014Wade might have been the pervert who drugged us and got me naked. Though the lovely and relaxing internal examination proved I was still a virgin. Thank you, God in Heaven, a female doctor did it.</p><p>Possibility number two\u2014Wade might not even have been there and the poison was still wreaking havoc on my mind, and now I was alone in the dark forest hallucinating. Like I had at the hospital.</p><p>Possibility number three, and honestly the most likely\u2014Wade was trying to go for a nice walk, when a strange girl he didn\u2019t know starting yelling and running, albeit sadly, after him.</p><p>I thought about it for a second, while I stood perfectly still. I tried not to think about the fact he could very well be stalking me, after not getting what he had wanted at the party. I was uncertain about how to proceed; fleeing from the forest screaming like a banshee was definitely at the top of a very short list. That option was followed by pretending someone else was with me. I knew that would either scare him into thinking I was crazy, if he was watching me, or make him believe I wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>I stayed frozen like an idiot instead, with my heart racing like a rabbit. I heard a crunch off to the side and prepared myself for the worst.</p> <p>\u201cAimee?\u201d the voice was unmistakable.</p><p>I opened my eyes, which I hadn\u2019t realized I had closed and started to breathe again. \u201cShane, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my yard.\u201d He walked toward me laughing. \"What are you doing standing there with your eyes closed?\"</p><p>He looked amazing\u2014chinos, a baby blue t-shirt, and his sandy hair was messy from whatever he had been doing. Seeing him made me want to smell him. I knew he would smell good. He always smelled like laundry soap and deodorant with a subtle mix of windblown sea air.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know your yard came over this way.\u201d I looked around, trying to see his house.</p><p>He held a hand out to me when he got close. \u201cYeah, it's twelve acres. Let me get you out the easy way; you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d He pointed to my forearms. \u201cJust there.\u201d</p><p>I looked down, noticing my arms were scratched up very badly. How had I not felt it? I had been so insane to find Wade that I couldn\u2019t feel the branches scratching me that badly? I started to worry about lasting side effects of the drugs, such as partial paralysis and hallucinations.</p><p>\u201cIs Wade here with you?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, looking upset. \u201cNo, I\u2019m alone. What the hell are you doing out of bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed some fresh air. I couldn\u2019t stay cooped up anymore. I would really like to meet your friend Wade; can you take me there?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Shane nodded looking down on me with his beautiful blue eyes. \u201cYeah for sure, we can go now.\u201d</p><p>He seemed irritated with me for some reason.</p><p>\u201cReally, you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. Since your sister started dating that nerd friend of yours, my calendar is wide open.\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped. \u201cDating? He isn\u2019t a nerd\u2014he\u2019s a nice boy.\u201d I was freaking out inside; no wonder he was angry with me\u2014my sister had broken his heart. I couldn\u2019t believe her and Blake were dating. I didn\u2019t believe it. My heart should have been broken, but something seemed wrong inside of me. My reactions weren\u2019t what they used to be. I was more upset that Shane was hurt than anything.</p><p>Shane laughed again, squeezing my hand, which I didn\u2019t realize he was still holding. I blushed looking at it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess they\u2019ve been secretly dating for a few days or whatever. She\u2019s been lying and saying she was going to her friend's place to your dad, but meeting him this last week. I guess something happened yesterday that sealed the deal.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened on my hand as he pulled me through the woods.</p><p>I pulled back a bit. \u201cShane, I know she hurt you, but it is hard for me to walk fast like that. My body is still exhausted.\u201d</p><p>He let go of my hand. \u201cOh my God\u2014I\u2019m such an idiot. Here let me help you.\u201d He reached down and picked me up, before I could protest. He looked into my eyes. \"Your sister never hurt me, Aimee. I knew what she was like all along.\"</p><p>I gulped feeling the heat radiate from him. I changed the subject. \"This isn\u2019t necessary. I can walk, just slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is faster, Aimes, and I am not a patient guy,\u201d he said it in a throaty way, which I chalked up to him exerting a lot of energy to carry me through the woods.</p><p>I had managed to gain back four pounds of the fourteen I was down. I was disgusted when I had weighed myself. I weighed what an eight-year-old should weigh.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell I\u2019ve gained weight?\u201d</p><p>He laughed as we reached the forest\u2019s edge and he placed me down on the grass. \u201cNo. You\u2019re still light as a feather.\u201d</p><p>I straightened my jacket and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get back up. I might even go about ten over my healthy weight, in case something like this happens again. I didn\u2019t have any extra weight to lose.\u201d</p><p>\"Protein shakes and meal replacements. It's what we use on the football team to gain.\"</p><p>\"I might have to try that. I hate being this thin.\"</p><p>He nodded looking serious now. \u201cYeah, Giselle is pretty tiny now too, huh?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my feet. \u201cYeah, she isn\u2019t doing well. They have her on some meds now, but they\u2019re discovering she has allergies to quite a few things. I\u2019m going in a week with Alise to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Blake going?\u201d Shane sounded jealous.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I didn\u2019t know they were dating. I\u2019m sorry she hurt you, I know you liked her.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed at it again. \u201cLike I said before, she didn\u2019t hurt me, just embarrassed me. I hate that she hurt you, her and that friend of yours.\u201d</p><p>I was taken aback. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and I felt the air between us fill with something I couldn\u2019t name, tension perhaps. His eyes were definitely full of an intensity I had never seen before.</p><p>We walked the huge backyard to his truck in the driveway. He pulled out a first aid kit and cleaned my scratches. I felt winded and exhausted from all the exercise, but I didn\u2019t want the moment to end.</p><p>\u201cYou and I laid out on the grass the night of the party. We talked for a long time. Then we sat in silence. Do you remember that?\u201d He opened the door for me to get in, when he was done.</p><p>I shook my head. I still felt lost with the details of the dreaded night. \u201cI\u2019m hoping by seeing Wade, it will trigger some memories. Something about him is so familiar and he is all I really remember about that night.\u201d</p><p>I attempted to climb into the huge truck, but my side felt like stitches were being ripped out slowly. I winced and inhaled sharply. His huge warm hands were on me, as he lifted me carefully. I didn\u2019t notice the pain, just the warmth of his hands on me.</p><p>As he closed the door for me, I realized I had become an invalid, not that I minded. The tragedy had brought us closer together. It was nice, always being close to him and not feeling guilty about him dating my sister.</p><p>I smiled. \"Thanks for taking me; I can't seem to get his face out of my mind.\"</p><p>Shane got into the driver side and looked puzzled. \u201cSee, that\u2019s the weird part\u2014I don\u2019t remember you even talking to him. I asked him about it and he doesn\u2019t remember you, either.\u201d He started the truck and drove around the circle driveway.</p><p>\u201cThat is weird. Maybe it was a ghost.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cHey, don\u2019t kid. My mom said our yard used to be some ancient native shaman's land. My great granddad's family bought the land from the shaman's family, but I guess the old shaman was pretty pissed that they sold the land. I guess they were starving out here though and felt it was cursed or some crap.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard. So, your yard is like a pet cemetery?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded half-heartedly. \u201cI guess so. We\u2019ve never had any bad luck though. Well, except for my dad screwing some twenty-five-year-old, but I highly doubt it had anything to do with the pet cemetery, and more to do with the piece of ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom must be pretty mad.\u201d</p><p>His face grew concerned, but he kept his eyes straightforward. \u201cYeah, she isn\u2019t taking it well. Please don\u2019t ever say anything, but I found her in the bathroom. She took a bunch of pills and cut herself.\u201d</p> <p>My jaw dropped. I tried not to let it, but it did it anyway. \u201cOh my God. I\u2019m so sorry, Shane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst part is, that when I found her she looked at me and said, \u201cLet me die, son,\u201d but I called the police and an ambulance. What kind of shit is that to say to your kid?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hands as I fidgeted with my ring. \u201cI think when she\u2019s feeling better, she will know you made the right choice.\u201d</p><p>We were quiet for a long time both, lost in contemplation. Neither of us wanted to make the other dwell on the misfortune in our life.</p><p>It amazed me how many bad things could happen in a small town, in such a short amount of time. Maybe the land was all cursed.</p> <p>We entered the neighboring town and turned onto a road, I had never been on before. Within a few driveways, we were at a small bungalow.</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d he pointed to the man, or guy our age, in the garage. \u201cThat\u2019s Wade.\u201d</p><p>I felt nervous, as I opened my door and got out gingerly. Shane hopped out roughly and bound into the garage to scare the guy bent over the hood of a car.</p><p>He spanked his bum hard, causing the guy to shoot up and smack his head on the hood of the old beater.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, Shane. That\u2019s gonna leave a mark.\u201d He rubbed his head.</p><p>Shane laughed and pointed to me. \u201cThis is Aimee, the girl who got drugged at my party.\u201d</p> <p>Wade turned. He looked about the right size, a few inches over six foot and strong but not fat. He was wearing jeans and white t-shirt. His hair was dark blond. But when he turned his face to see me, he was definitely not the same guy.</p><p>His eyes were nowhere near as blue and his face didn\u2019t have the devastating beauty. He smiled at me. His face was attractive, but not nearly as handsome as the guy I had seen. \u201cHey gorgeous, you know what? I don\u2019t recall you but I know your face. I\u2019ve met your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure everyone has \u2018met\u2019 my sister.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Shane frowned. \u201cAnyway, buddy, we thought we would take a drive out and see if meeting you could help jog her memory.\u201d</p><p>I had never seen Shane roughhouse with anyone, except on the field.</p><p>Wade shoved him back. \u201cDid we find out who that creepy bastard is yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but when we do, we will be sure to ask for some assistance from you boys.\u201d Shane punched him in the arm and started to walk toward the truck.</p><p>Wade\u2019s smile grew menacing. \u201cYes, be sure you do. Nothing we Handley boys like more than giving out a good ass kicking. Well, I better get back to the car. Nice meeting you, Aimee. Hope your memory comes back.\u201d He looked at Shane, smiling but speaking to me, \u201cHey, did your sister break up with Shane there?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>He smiled even bigger. \u201cWell, tell her I said hello then.\u201d</p><p>Shane laughed and gave him the finger.</p><p>I waved at him as I climbed back into the truck, using all my strength and trying not to cry out loud.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was dating that girl.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHe is, but he likes to mess with me. Everyone did. They thought I was nuts for dating your sister.\u201d</p><p>\"Why did you? I don\u2019t get it.\"</p><p>He shrugged and looked lost. \"I don\u2019t know. Trying to force something that was never going to happen, I guess.\" He looked at me and closed the door. \u201cWanna get something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m starving and it\u2019s been like six hours since I ate. I\u2019m never going to gain anything back if I don\u2019t eat regularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you look pretty, no matter what you weigh.\u201d He smirked at me.</p><p>I felt a funny feeling in my stomach. I had long believed guys who dated my sister or thought she was sexy were bad news. With him, it was harder to convince myself.</p><p>He pulled into the town\u2019s local burger shack. \u201cThe Wood Inn\u201d was not exactly known for its gourmet, but the veggie burgers were pretty yummy.</p><p>He hopped out quickly to open my door for me and help me out. I liked this about him. Shane was a gentleman, regardless of dating my sister, and that was always appreciated. I got a slight hint of laundry soap and deodorant when I climbed out, and it made me smile. He always smelled clean, not draped in aftershave or cologne like every other guy our age.</p><p>We got a seat inside by the window.</p><p>\u201cReady to order?\u201d The server seemed to appear out of nowhere.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll have the veggie burger, no bacon, with cheese, extra tomato and a side of yam fries.\u201d</p><p>She nodded at my order, not even considering how stupid it was to have to ask for no bacon on one's veggie burger.</p><p>She looked at Shane. \u201cI will have the bacon cheese burger, with bacon, no tomato and a side of regular fries. I will also have a chocolate shake.\u201d</p><p>She finished writing it down and glanced at me while taking the menus. \u201cWater okay for you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and she was gone.</p><p>\u201cSo you like your bacon cheese burger with bacon?\u201d I asked making him smile.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can stomach a veggie burger without bacon.\u201d</p><p>I laughed shaking my head at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a veggie for a long time. What is it, seven years now?\u201d he asked playing with the fork and knife on the tabletop.</p><p>I smiled at him, completely taken aback. \u201cYeah, it will be eight at Christmas. How do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI just notice stuff, I guess. So who are you going to the spring formal with?\u201d</p><p>I gulped blindsided again. \u201cOh my God...I kind of figured it would be Blake. I guess I\u2019m not going. I\u2019m not a dance kind of girl, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\"You can't dance?\"</p><p>I laughed. \"I can dance just fine. I just don\u2019t do popular kids and drinking and shit.\"</p><p>\u201cDances and cusses. Look at you. Well, I was taking Alise. Why don\u2019t we go together?\u201d</p><p>I sipped my water cautiously. \u201cAs friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t see how we can be anything else, Aimee; you need some time, I think, to get better.\u201d</p><p>Relief and disappointment battled inside of me. \u201cOkay sure. I have a rule anyway, about dating boys who date my sister.\u201d My face reddened with the completely unnecessary statement.</p><p>He sat back still playing with the utensils. \u201cOkay good. I like you so much, and I like being with you, as friends.\u201d</p><p>I laughed wistfully. Secretly, I imagined what it would be like to be held by his strong arms, besides being carried all the time like a feeble invalid.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was thinking the exact same thing. Unless it's weird, \u2018cause of Alise and Blake. I mean, I know you said you never liked her, but every boy likes her. Let's be honest.\"</p><p>\"Your sister is evil. I can't even believe you are related. You\u2019re more like a sweet girl next door that I would want to marry. Your sister is not the marrying type; she's like the spring break type.\u201d</p><p>I gulped at him saying marriage and my name in the same sentence, but then translated his whole speech and frowned a little. His little rant was not meant to hurt my feelings, but being told I wasn\u2019t sexy was a little hurtful. It hurt, even though I have always believed sexy was not something teenage girls should ever strive for.</p><p>He shook his head and fiddled with the things on the table. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t say such bad things about her; she is your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no illusions about my sister, Shane; she is exactly who she is. She burns through men. She has no self-respect and even less for anyone else. She is always attracted to the things she can\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, speak of the devil and she shall arrive at your favorite burger joint.\u201d</p><p>I turned to see my sister and Blake walking hand in hand. They stopped dead as they saw Shane and me sitting at the table. Our food arrived as the waitress brought them to the seat behind us. Blake dropped her hand and straightened up in his stance, not letting his gaze leave mine. It was as if he was trying to reassure me.</p><p>Alise smiled sweetly. \u201cFancy meeting you two here.\u201d She looked back and forth between us suspiciously. \"On a date?\" Her words were sarcastic and biting.</p><p>I ignored it and muttered, \u201cWe went to see Wade.\u201d</p><p>Blake looked nervous but tried to remain calm. \u201cThe elusive Wade\u2014what did he have to say about the party?\u201d He kept his gaze on me as if we were the only people in the room. I avoided him. I was still angry with him and not in the mood to discuss it in a diner.</p><p>Shane shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not the right guy. She didn\u2019t recognize Wade at all.\u201d</p><p>It was tense. Every voice was filled with some kind of savage emotion.</p><p>\u201cCan we just sit with you?\u201d Alise asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s just go somewhere else, Alise.\u201d Blake wasn\u2019t pleading; he was telling. He pulled her back toward the entrance. \u201cEnjoy your meal,\u201d he said, dragging her out onto the street.</p><p>I sighed and picked up my juicy veggie burger and smiled at Shane. \u201cBon Appetite.\u201d</p><p>He tried to smile, but his anger was obvious.</p><p>I took the biggest bite I could. The tastes started to swirl in my mouth, the flavor was so similar. I hated the taste. I started to feel like I was going to throw up. My favorite veggie burger in the world was making me sick. I grabbed my napkin and spit the huge bite into it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Shane. I don\u2019t usually spit out food, but it tastes exactly like my vomit the other night. I had a veggie burger for dinner that night before the party.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up. \u201cYou remember the taste of your puke!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I realized what I had said and indeed some memory had come back. \u201cAlise did my hair and makeup and made me wear the outfit I was wearing. I ate the veggie burger in secret in my room, so she wouldn\u2019t know I ate. My dad had picked it up for me when he picked up his pizza.\u201d</p><p>He clapped. \u201cYes, see some of it is coming back.\u201d</p><p>I was excited, except for the fact veggie burgers were going to be off the menu for quite a while.</p> <p>Shane took me home after I stopped picking at my fries. I dragged myself up the stairs, half dead I was certain. My body ached. My liver pains were unbearable. I climbed into my bed and fell asleep with my clothes on.</p><p>The warm wind came again. His voice crept through my dreams.</p><p>\"Get better, Aimee. Get better and forget about me.\"</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The word is hamtard...</p> <p>I felt my phone vibrate in my jacket pocket as I was trudging my way to chemistry the next day. I would never dread chem, but an hour sitting next to one of the biggest frauds on earth was hard to stomach. Blake had pretended nothing was going on with my sister. They both swore nothing was going on.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t really spoken to my sister since the incident, but I knew that I had been taken by one of the best grifters in the world. She was a pro con artist, from not wanting to do chores to juggling four boyfriends.</p><p>Trying to think on other things, I thought about how I needed to see the 'not Wade' guy again. He was plaguing my dreams. I had become convinced he was a ghost, who I could only see when I was near Shane\u2019s house or sleeping. I didn\u2019t believe in ghosts at all, but even I had to admit it was odd that the only times I had seen him were at Shane's. I knew I was just scaring myself with the shaman ghost story I had cooked up in my head, but I needed to see him again. I needed to prove he was real. Something about him was driving me insane.</p><p>I thought about him day and night. I could hear his voice. He was talking about my veggie burger and chewing next time. His face and words were the only memory I had. I recalled seeing him in the bathroom at Shane\u2019s, but the memory was fuzzy.</p><p>I looked over, noticing the kids at school whispering and watching me. It wasn\u2019t one group of kids. It was all the kids in the courtyard. I tried not to notice. It was hard going from complete unknown to that girl who got drugged and nearly raped.</p><p>I held my books tight to my chest and looked toward my class, but I saw Blake walk up to the class door. I cringed, thinking about being around him, and for the first time ever, I decided I needed more air than chemicals. I decided to ditch and go to Shane\u2019s house. Mr. Mac saw me running the wrong way, well maybe not running. \u201cAimee, what are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>I looked down at the ground ashamed. \u201cSir, I need to go home. I\u2019m feeling sick.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou are the worst liar ever.\u201d Mr. Mac knew me better than any other teacher. His youthful look had people believing him to be just a youngster, but he was smarter than any teacher in the school...even the fossils like the lit teacher.</p><p>He walked toward me, looking extremely concerned. \u201cAre you having a problem getting back into the swing of things?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah, it seems hard to focus now. I\u2019m tired a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>He looked down on me and pointed to the chemistry room. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk this way, and if you follow, great, and if you don\u2019t, I might not notice cause I\u2019m pretty preoccupied with the marks on the test we took two weeks ago. The ninety-eight you got probably earned you a day off from class, if you want to think about it that way.\u201d His eyes grew dark. \u201cI truly hope you\u2019re feeling better, Aimee.\u201d</p><p>I looked up into his dark-brown eyes and smiled, relieved. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, Mr. Mac. Thanks.\u201d He nodded and walked away from me, strolling casually toward the chem lab.</p><p>I hobbled over to where Shane was taking his welding class and waved at him through the shop doors. He looked at me, puzzled.</p><p>He walked over, looking sexy in his coveralls with his welding helmet lifted up and bits of grease and dirt on his face.</p> <p>He smiled at me as he opened the door. \u201cAimes, what\u2019s up? You taking shop now?\u201d</p><p>\"Uh, no. Not unless an early death for both of us is on the syllabus.\" I held my hand out. \u201cI need your truck keys. I want to go to your house for a bit. I think your yard is haunted.\u201d</p><p>He burst out laughing and fished his keys out of his pocket. \u201cYou are the weirdest girl I have ever met. I notice you\u2019ve gained a bit of weight, by the way. I meant to say something \u2018cause you\u2019re filling out again. Want me to come?\u201d</p><p>\"No. That's cool. I'll be back before class is over to give you back your truck.\" I took the keys and grinned at him. \u201cThanks, this is a good look for you too. I think if you wore this to the spring formal, I might want to dance.\u201d</p><p>He winked and closed the door.</p><p>I turned on my heel, feeling very flirty. I knew it was that I felt so safe with him. I knew nothing would ever come of our flirting, even though deep, deep down where I never let myself go, I hoped it would.</p><p>I went to the truck, feeling a small sense of freedom mixed with a lot of guilt. I never skipped, ever. The one good thing about being a straight-A student was that at the end of the school year, it was pretty well sorted out what your grade was going to be. We had two and a half months of school left, and I was at a ninety-three percent average. Skipping out one day wasn\u2019t going to cost me too much.</p><p>The drive to Shane\u2019s house was about five minutes, and for some reason, I couldn\u2019t help looking in my rear-view. I was not a very good criminal.</p><p>I pulled into the driveway and hopped out of the truck. My ribs were hurting, but I ignored it and walked quickly up to the house. I was so hopeful, it was ridiculous. I wandered around the outside of the huge grey house. I looked behind myself sharply and then peeking around corners. If anyone saw me, they would instantly assume master spy or total idiot. I was going with the latter. I looked like a moron sneaking around the bushes and the vibrant green grass.</p><p>I decided the woods were my best bet.</p><p>I looked around, stopping midway across the lawn to listen for anyone who might be following me. I decided that thinking about creepy people following you was not the smartest way to enter the woods.</p><p>The trees on the North Coast were huge; \u2018big\u2019 was what you called a tree at half its size here. The trees, in the woods that Shane called a yard, were massive. I felt the forest air hit me like a ton of bricks as I entered. It was freezing and damp. I crept along looking all around me.</p><p>I decided camping out in a quiet spot was my best plan. Then, like a rabbit hopping into a trap, I would be able to see him, but he wouldn\u2019t see me.</p><p>I crept through huge ferns and old man's beard covering the branches. The forest thinned out remarkably once you were inside of it. The canopy of the huge trees was a filter for the light; not a lot of other small trees and bushes could grow. Moss and ferns didn\u2019t need light to prosper. The forest on the North Coast always reminded me of Jurassic Park. The air was clean and pure but colder sometimes by five or six degrees.</p><p>I found the old tree fort Shane had constructed once with his friends and hid at the base of the tree next to it. There was a small bush surrounded by several huge ferns and if I sat still long enough, I could probably see his ghost. I climbed into the bush and fluffed the ferns around me.</p><p>I pulled my jacket tight around me and drew the hood up around my head to cover my blonde hair. The black jacket helped me to blend into the bush and massive trunk. I settled back on the dirt, leaning against the tree and sat still. I turned my phone to vibrate and waited.</p><p>I wanted to say I was a peaceful enough person, that the calm of the forest and the small noises it made throughout the day were relaxing. Instead, I felt on edge, hiding in the forest, watching for either a ghost or a stalker.</p><p>I heard a crunch after ten minutes, fifty feet back toward the house. I stayed very still as it came closer.</p><p>I felt my heartbeat increasing as the noise got louder and louder. I wanted to close my eyes and become invisible or blink my way back to the safety of my own room. I was terrified. As the sound got loud enough, I swore I could feel the vibration of the branches breaking. I knew for an unexplainable reason that the noise was not the ghost. I needed to fear whatever made the noise.</p><p>I heard it breathing. It was out of breath or nervous like I was. I knew the bush covered me, but if it got close enough, it would be able to see me.</p><p>Its pace slowed to a step every minute as it scanned the forest behind me somewhere. I knew what it was doing, even if I couldn\u2019t see it, and I knew then that it was a danger to me. Somehow I knew it was the person who drugged me, and I started to panic as I realized there were only a few feet between him and me. If I could get a glance of his face, I knew I would know him. He and the not-Wade guy were different people. I sensed the evil coming from this person. I knew everyone in our town that was near my age, and there was no way someone was at the party that I didn\u2019t know, at least a little. I waited to see his face when he came around the trees. I could know my attacker and text it to Shane before he got me.</p><p>His steps sounded like they were on top of me. I wanted to dash from the woods screaming, but I knew my dash was more of a light jog at best. I also knew that in every horror movie I had ever seen, the hiding person would have lived, if they had just stayed hidden. But they always let the suspense and madness get to them.</p><p>\u201cAimee, are you here?\u201d he spoke in a breathless whisper. I couldn\u2019t even be certain it was a man\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cAimee, I saw you come into the woods. I just wanted to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>He knew my name and he was watching me. There was something familiar about the way he whispered my name, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. I knew he must have gone to school with me\u2014how else would he have seen me take Shane\u2019s truck?</p><p>I didn\u2019t even swallow as the breaking of the twigs and leaves attempted to drive me insane. I waited till I heard his footsteps walk in a different direction and I reached into my pocket and grabbed my phone. I clicked the sound off completely. I was glad I had worn a hoodie and not a jacket that made noise. I slowly put my phone back into my pocket and left it there. I knew nothing would make me leave that spot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Through the brush I saw him. I wanted to run, but I held my breath and sat very still. It was definitely a man, or a guy my age, at the least. He was tall. He wore a black fleece with the hood up and jeans. I couldn\u2019t see his face, but I could hear his breathing\u2014he was upset about not being able to find me.</p><p>\u201cAimee, come out, come out, wherever you are,\u201d he spoke, as if he were disguising his voice. A noise like a bird squawking rang out into the forest. Then it happened again. He cussed and pulled a cell phone out of his pocket. \u201cHello.\u201d he answered abruptly still sounding horse as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYeah, fine. I don\u2019t care. Okay good. See you then.\u201d He hung up the phone and looked around the forest more intensely.</p> <p>When he turned his face to me I could see he was wearing sunglasses. He was white. I could see his lips very clearly; I would never forget them. They were thin lips, not my favorite kind. Beyond that, I couldn\u2019t tell anything else about him.</p><p>\u201cAimee, I know you want to play cat and mouse, but we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d His voice sounded impatient, no matter how hard he was trying to sound calm. I knew in my heart that he was the one who had drugged me, and he wanted to finish what he had started. The idea of him touching me while I had been drugged made me sick. I swallowed the bile back as I sat, ever calm, against my tree hidden in the brush.</p><p>I was starting to feel much attachment to the tree as I sat there hiding. It was keeping me safe.</p><p>He crept around the bushes a bit longer and then he stopped moving. I couldn\u2019t see or hear him. I knew what he was doing. He was sitting somewhere like me. He was trying to wait me out. But I was the girl who sat on the concrete for hours on end. It was not a game he would win.</p><p>My breaths were shallow and my heartbeat stayed steady to keep my senses heightened and alert. I didn\u2019t hear a sound from the forest, which also told me he was still here.</p> <p>The birds were not chirping because a predator was in the woods. I was thirsty, I was hungry, my back was cramping up, and my legs were numb, but I sat very still, like a statue, and listened.</p><p>There was no sound, no creeping about, no breathing, no nothing, but I still didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Then, like the angels were singing to me, I heard the greatest sound in the world.</p><p>\u201cGod damn, Aimee! I had to walk home from friggin\u2019 school. What the hell is taking you so long? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to jump up and shout that I was over by the tree house, but I knew the evil one was still in this forest somewhere. I hadn\u2019t heard him leave, had I? I was starting to doubt myself as I panicked knowing my salvation was across the forest, and he would leave soon.</p><p>I pulled my phone from my pocket and texted Shane with the sound off completely. The text hit his phone. His text tone was unmistakable\u2014it was Ralph Wiggum, \"My cat\u2019s breath smells like cat food.\" He had gotten it as his text ringtone when we were sitting in the restaurant, after my sister left with Blake.</p> <p>He started to walk through the forest, obeying my text message perfectly, until he reached my exact location.</p><p>I could see him looking around, his blue hoodie hovering directly above me.</p><p>I still felt terrified as I reached my hand from the bushes and Shane grabbed it. He pulled me from my spot. As I stood, my legs buckled and I started to cry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I got you now.\u201d He picked me up and carried me from the woods. I looked back at the forest, seeing nothing, but I noticed a very quick pace in Shane\u2019s steps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of carrying you out of these woods, missy.\u201d He was joking but I continued to sob into his shoulder. I felt safe, even if I was scared senseless.</p><p>Shane brought me into the house and sat me on the bar stool in the kitchen. He poured me a glass of lemonade and handed me a tissue. I wiped my eyes and told him exactly what had happened. His eyes widened as I told the tale and his face grew very angry. I could see he was putting his own conclusions together.</p><p>\u201cThis guy goes to our school\u2014how else would he have seen you take my truck? Aimee, he was invited to MY house and drugged MY friends and you.\u201d He paced and ranted shaking his hands and shouting. He separated me from his friends. I wasn\u2019t one of his friends? I tried to be polite and sip the lemonade but I gagged and put it down. I guessed it would be joining the ranks with the veggie burger.</p><p>Finally, he called my dad and told him to come and pick me up at his house for our trip to Portland.</p> <p>I sipped the hot tea he made me, instead of the lemonade, after he noticed I couldn\u2019t drink it. He never left his post watching out the windows, looking for any sort of shadows or movements.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to do to get my safety back, but I was worried for myself and for Giselle in the city. I knew the hospital had good security, as it was a children\u2019s hospital. I wasn\u2019t sure it would be enough; the creep seemed pretty good.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming for me,\u201d I whispered after a long time.</p><p>Shane smiled down at me. \u201cAimee, you\u2019re my date for the dance. Where will I find a date with this short of notice?\u201d I punched his arm, hurting my hand.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have a dress picked out and had decided I would find one in the city. \u201cWhat color dress should I get?\u201d I wanted the conversation to be light; I missed Giselle.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhatever you want.\"</p><p>I jumped, as a knock on the door interrupted us.</p><p>Shane\u2019s eyes grew serious as he walked to the door and peeked through the window. He unlocked the door and greeted my dad. \u201cMr. James, come on in.\u201d</p><p>My dad smiled at me and he shook Shane\u2019s hand. I could see the worry all over his face.</p><p>\u201cI called the police, Aimee. I know nothing happened and they understand that, but they\u2019re as worried as I am. It's better for them to have a full handle on what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling the reality of the situation hit me again. It had been pleasant\u2014fun even\u2014sitting in the kitchen with Shane. But when the reality set back in, it hit like a ton of bricks.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming here, Shane. I hope you don\u2019t mind. They should be here any minute.\u201d My dad walked into the house and put a hand on my shoulder. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m good, if I don\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think most things are like that. What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \"I don\u2019t know.\" My face flushed, and I felt foolish. What had I been thinking?</p><p>Shane walked around the bar and started to make some coffee in his mom\u2019s expensive coffee maker. The huge stainless steel contraption looked like it belonged to a barista. Shane had a cup of coffee for my dad within seconds.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, sir. Cream or sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, son. Black is perfect.\u201d He sipped his coffee. We all looked out at the backyard, watching. \u201cThis is a good cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mom bought it in Seattle. It cost more than my truck, I think.\u201d</p><p>My dad laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Alise?\u201d I asked knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cShe is at Blake\u2019s house. His parents are letting her stay over. They know about the situation and that we need to go see Giselle. She is not to leave their house until we arrive home.\u201d My dad spoke as if he had an awful taste in his mouth. I knew it was my sister\u2019s way of twisting a bad situation to her advantage.</p><p>He looked at me concerned. \u201cDid you get a good look at him?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, he had a dark fleece on with a hood, sunglasses, and his voice was raspy, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize it if I tried. He knew my name. He was tall, like Shane\u2019s height and build, and white. He was wearing jeans\u2014dark jeans. His lips, they were so thin\u2014cruel and thin. His phone rang with a squawking bird. It was black I think, maybe a Blackberry.\u201d</p><p>My dad looked at Shane and me. \u201cSounds like every one of your friends.\u201d</p><p>Shane nodded. \u201cI think, at this point everyone should be on the list of suspects, including me. I'm certain the police will say the same thing. Though for the record, I have nice lips and an iPhone.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Shane. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back, but my dad\u2019s eyes were not as trusting as he watched us.</p><p>The doorbell interrupted. \u201cThe police,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>Shane walked to the door, opening it without looking.</p><p>Two police officers entered the house, shaking Shane\u2019s hand and introducing themselves.</p><p>I recognized one of them instantly as the police officer who had asked Giselle and me questions in the hospital.</p><p>He smiled at me kindly. \u201cHi, Aimee, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cGood, I feel pretty good. I\u2019m a lot better. I just wish this was over, though.\u201d</p><p>The other officer nodded. \u201cYes, you\u2019ve been through enough, I think.\u201d</p><p>My dad laughed sarcastically. \u201cOh\u2014more than.\u201d</p><p>The older officer, who I had never met before, smiled at my dad. \u201cAnd how is Dad holding up?\u201d</p><p>My dad shook his head. \u201cOur family doesn\u2019t need any extra drama, not this year.\u201d</p><p>The police officer, whose nametag said Williams, gave my dad a knowing look. They appeared to have some sort of a relationship I didn\u2019t know about.</p><p>\u201cCoffee, guys?\u201d Shane asked, breaking the sorrow hanging in the air.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d The young police officer chimed in. His name was Constable Bindley.</p><p>\u201cAimee, Corporal Williams here was with your mom at the end,\u201d my dad said quietly as he held his hand out to the tall, older-looking man.</p><p>I felt my throat get thick, as his eyes looked at me, full of emotion. I nodded dropping my vision to the counter top.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d His words hung in the air with the rest of the tension, along with the scent of the coffees Shane handed out.</p><p>Constable Bindley sipped his. \u201cI guess all we need here is a statement. Shane, were you here when it happened?\u201d</p><p>Shane shook his head. \u201cI was walking home from school \u2018cause Aimee had my truck.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at the hint of bitterness in his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, Aimee, you tell it exactly the way it happened, and if no one else could talk while we have the tape recorder going, that would be great. Ready?\u201d the corporal asked.</p><p>I nodded, taking a deep breath and began at the start, ghosts and all.</p><p>The three-and-half-hour drive gave me more than enough time to consider the essence of life. My dad didn\u2019t need to talk, which was nice. We could ride in quiet contemplation, instead of trying desperately to fill the air. My dad wasn\u2019t a talker on a good day, so his version of small talk always ended up feeling more like a guessing game.</p> <p>The only thing he wanted to know was about the mystery man in my hazy memories. I told him it was more like a dream than reality.</p><p>Fifteen minutes away from the hospital, I was excited and scared. I had to tell Giselle the worst news. Not only had some psycho tried to kill us, but also now he was hunting us. I dreaded telling her, but the hospital needed to know every possibility. The police from home had called the hospital and put them on high alert, but it didn\u2019t change things\u2014Giselle needed the full story. It sickened me to have to stress her out more than she already was.</p><p>Dad dropped me off at the entrance and went to the hotel to check us in for the night.</p><p>The Children\u2019s Hospital was like an amusement park of doom. Pictures and paintings lined the walls with murals of the sunny days and beaches the children might not ever see. I swallowed a huge lump to ensure I wasn\u2019t weepy before I even saw her.</p><p>I looked at my text from her and pushed the right floor button on the elevator. I stepped off and walked down the hall. Giselle\u2019s room was the last door before the hall took a corner. I knocked lightly, hoping she was awake.</p> <p>\u201cGiselle, you here?\u201d I asked, poking my head in.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Aimee. What took so long? It\u2019s been like three weeks and I am dying in here. It\u2019s so boring.\u201d She nearly squealed as I entered smiling. She was lying on her bed with a light on, but the curtains were closed, making it dim.</p><p>I walked up and hugged her; she smelled funny, like sickness. She gripped me so tightly I could barely breathe. I held her and closed my eyes and pretended so many things all at once.</p><p>She let go finally and smiled brightly, but I could see through the fa\u00e7ade. She was still very sick. Her eyes were yellowish and her skin looked tanned. Giselle was going into liver failure. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I ignored it and decided she would tell me if she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cSo did you hear?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Giselle nodded. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s all over Facebook already. So he followed you into the woods? What the hell were you doing in the woods alone, tard?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed. \u201cEasy with words like that. It\u2019s really rude.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cI realize you don\u2019t know its origin, but older people take offense to younger people lingo. Just say hamtard; it\u2019s a word I made up for Alise. She says the other one all the time too. Anyway, I went to the woods because I wanted to find the guy from the party. I know ghosts aren\u2019t real, but I just couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. The only place I\u2019ve ever seen him was at Shane\u2019s house...\u201d</p><p>She cut me off, \u201cWhat is going on with you and Shane?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cGiselle, you\u2019re focusing on the wrong part of the story. Nothing is going on. He\u2019s just a friend. Besides, he dated Alise.\u201d</p><p>Giselle made a face, I laughed at her.</p><p>I continued, \u201cAs I was saying, I can\u2019t stop thinking about this guy, and I wanted to find him so bad. I went to Shane\u2019s and waited in the woods. I hid, basically, at the base of a tree in the bushes. I really thought he would just be walking through the woods, but instead the other guy followed me there. He\u2019s a creep. The guy in my memory, or dream\u2014rather, isn\u2019t the guy from the woods.\u201d</p><p>Giselle frowned at me. \u201cYou really have the worst taste in guys. First you like Blake, blech, and then this crazy stalker who tries to kill us, and all the while Shane is in front of you, and you feel nothing more than friendly love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same guy\u2014I swear. What did the doctor say?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to shake it. My bile ducts aren\u2019t healing or something. I am pretty much screwed, Aimes. I think the doctors are talking a donor list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom came back. I guess she and my dad haven\u2019t been in love for a long time. So she decided to Internet date and met some guy. She brought him here. She\u2019s living in the city with him.\u201d Her face filled with shame as mine filled with shock and disgust.</p><p>I gasped. \u201cInternet guy?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah, it was weird. Creepy bastard, he patted my leg, all high up on the thigh and said he always wanted a daughter. I threw up on him.\u201d She burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Your mom has met a ped on the Internet. Giselle, I\u2019m thinking we need a young priest and an old priest.\u201d</p><p>Giselle laughed. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about, but I know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from The Exorcist. I mean, I think we're cursed. At least you barfed on him\u2014what a nasty pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod is mad at us for something, Aimes, \u2018cause this has been the worst year of my life.\u201d She was still laughing, but I could swear I heard a sob.</p><p>I agreed, shivering. \u201cYes, it has. The cop who was with my mom while she died is the corporal on our case. I can tell he wants to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s too creepy. Don\u2019t they get transferred out ever?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to die, Aimee\u2014I\u2019m scared.\u201d Her words were a whisper, hanging in the air, stopping my breath.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m scared too.\u201d</p><p>The moment was fleeting.</p><p>Then, like the master of her emotions she was, she started chatting about the mundane again. The words still hung in the air like a bad cloud about to pour down on us, but we chose not to look up. Regardless of the fact that we both knew it was impending doom, we fought against it with gossip and giggles.</p><p>I told her I needed a dress for spring formal. It made her misty eyed as she told me to take the dress she had bought; someone should get some use out of it. I tried to argue, but it was no use. She wanted me to wear it and I told her I would be honored. For some strange reason, I loved this girl, with all of my heart. She was the sister I should have had. We lay on her bed together talking and feeling the need for hope in our despair-filled voices.</p><p>\u201cIf I grow up and marry a rich man like I plan to, I\u2019m totally making him donate all his money to this place.\u201d She giggled, but I knew better than to see anything beyond the IF in the story.</p><p>She started to fall asleep, so I left her. I sent my dad a text, saying I was leaving, and walked down to the elevator and climbed on. I wanted to cry, but I knew it wouldn\u2019t change anything. She was dying and our would-be murderer was stalking me.</p><p>I stepped off the elevator to my dad's tired face.</p><p>\u201cHungry, kiddo?\u201d he asked as he put an arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to go to bed. Giselle\u2019s mom is dating an Internet pervert. He\u2019s an actual ped. Do you think we\u2019re cursed, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to wonder.\u201d His response floored me. My dad was a man of science, but even he was starting to become concerned about our little town.</p><p>The drive home the next day was not nearly as painful. I napped until I woke to my phone making a ping. A text message had come in. I reached into my pocket and grabbed the phone to see a message from Shane.</p><p>\u2018Hurry home. I\u2019m getting lonely.\u2019</p><p>I looked around at the gas station, seeing we were halfway home. I could see my dad inside paying for the gas and no doubt getting snacks.</p><p>I messaged him back. \u2018Giselle is sick, very sick.\u2019</p><p>My phone rang. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Shane\u2019s voice sounded concerned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dying. Liver failure. Shane, I can't take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. What can we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs a donor... oh, and if her mom comes back to our town, we need that guy she\u2019s dating gone. Like warn the cops and shit. He\u2019s a ped. He touched Giselle high up on the thigh and said he always wanted a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Ok, I will talk to them. That\u2019s sick. She is on her death bed and he\u2019s trying to touch her?\u201d Shane\u2019s voice was full of rage. I could tell he was trying to stay calm, hearing such hopelessness in my voice.</p><p>\"Are you close to home?\"</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll be there in three hours.\u201d There was silence on his end. I waited for him to speak and looked at my phone thinking I had lost the signal.</p><p>Suddenly, he just blurted into the dead air. \u201cI like you, Aimee. I can\u2019t stop myself. I\u2019m trying to just be your friend, but you\u2019re perfect, and I can\u2019t fight it anymore. I want to be with you. I wanted to be with you before, but with you being you and me being me...I just panicked.\u201d The words were everything I had ever wanted to hear, plus some I didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>The phone was silent again as I held my breath, not sure how to respond. \u201cOk. Uhm, maybe we should talk about this later.\u201d My heart was skipping beats and my head was dizzy.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I just wanted you to know. I\u2019m falling for you. I've fallen. It's done. I love you. I always have.\u201d He went silent after his declaration. I could tell this was hard for him, too.</p><p>I wanted to respond with a \u2018thank you, God\u2019 or \u2018please don\u2019t move from where you are. I\u2019ll be right there\u2019. Instead, I held my breath, and with the exhale I shouted, \u201cOk! So, I'll see you in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive safe.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>I sat staring ahead at the van in front of us. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I started my list of pros and cons and then I phoned Giselle.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Her voice was raspy.</p><p>\u201cShane just told me he likes me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She squealed into the phone. \u201cYayyyyyyy. Okay, I need to hear every detail word for word skip nothing.\u201d</p><p>I told her everything he told me, word for word, to which she responded with \u2018OMG\u2019 and \u2018seriously\u2019 and \u2018I knew it\u2019 on repeat.</p><p>Her advice wasn\u2019t exactly sage wisdom. \u201cI think you should just do it. You should date him and have sex with him. Your sister never did, hey? She never got him into bed. He was always busy and stressed out. That\u2019s why she's been sleeping with Mitchell this entire time.\u201d</p> <p>\"Oh my God. She's disgusting. Mitchell too?\"</p><p>\"What did you expect? She likes physical relationships, Aimes.\"</p><p>I cringed. \"I can't talk about this.\"</p><p>\u201cOkay, look\u2014I've got to go. I\u2019m super tired out. They took more blood this morning and I\u2019m beat. I\u2019ll see you in a few weeks. Cool?\u201d</p><p>I felt tears rolling down my cheeks. \u201cYeah for sure. Dad and I will be back. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeace out.\u201d She clicked off and I was alone again. I had officially lost control of my emotions.</p><p>I looked to the sky, well\u2014roof of the truck, and whispered, \u201cMom, I need you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>I am a rational human being.</p><p>I walked into the library, where Dad dropped me off. Thankfully, I felt the outside world leave me alone as I caught the first scent of the books. I loved the smell of books, but even more, I loved getting lost in them. If there ever was a time in my life I needed to get lost in books, it was that moment. I didn\u2019t know what to do about Shane, or Giselle, or the stalker. It was too much excitement for how sick I was starting to feel again. I worried about my own liver, nearly as much as I worried about Giselle's.</p><p>I smiled at the librarian. \u201cHey, Mary.\u201d</p> <p>She waved, not really letting her eyes leave the stacks she was checking. \u201cAimee, it\u2019s been forever. Thought you might have died, kid. You still have that book out on ancient medicinal practices?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Obviously, she hadn\u2019t heard. I nodded. \u201cYeah, I need it for a few more weeks; I will re-sign it out today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough for me.\u201d She walked over to her card catalogue.</p><p>Our library was tiny, with little to no technology ever making its way through the front doors. It was partly from lack of funding, and partly because it wasn\u2019t needed. Mary remembered every book that left and who it left with.</p><p>I made my way to the history section and sat on the floor touching the spines of the books, feeling the history flow from them to me. My mom had taught me to love and respect history, especially art. She said it was a visual documentation of history. Every aspect of a civilization's time, whether it was education, religion, or science, was documented in art. Even the cave paintings taught us something about the people of its time.</p><p>\u201cCan I just slip past you there?\u201d I knew his voice, straight away. Afraid I would be disappointed to find someone else yet again, I looked up to see his smiling face.</p><p>I felt myself beam. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, looking incredibly disappointed. \u201cSorry, have we met?\u201d</p> <p>He was exactly as I remembered, very tall, strong looking, dark-blond hair cut short and the whitest-blue eyes I had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life. I remember you. I was choking.\u201d The words flew from my mouth as the memories flooded my brain. I looked at his sizable hands and remembered them inside my mouth. I shuddered a little at the thought. \u201cI was on the floor turning blue, and you picked the vomit out of my mouth.\u201d</p><p>He started to laugh, instantly I loved the sound. It was strong. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss, but I think you\u2019re mistaken. I just need a book from where you\u2019re sitting.\u201d</p><p>I put a hand on the bookshelf to help myself stand. I winced as I stood up. My eyes met his chest. He was huge. \u201cNo, it\u2019s true\u2014I saw you.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop staring up into his eyes.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>I felt compelled to step closer to him and smell him. I knew he would smell familiar, like fresh ocean air but more intense, like incense. I didn\u2019t know how I knew what he would smell like; he was supposed to be a ghost.</p><p>\u201cLook, I'm really sorry, but I've never met you in my life. I think you\u2019re confused.\u201d He looked at me sternly, like he was trying to intimidate me into believing what my soul knew to be a lie.</p><p>I was nervous in the smallest part of my mind that he could still be the rapist. Even if, somehow, I knew his face better than I knew my own and his lips were not thin. They were full and soft looking, my favorite kind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Aimee.\u201d I put a hand out for him to take.</p><p>He hesitated and sighed, like he didn\u2019t want to touch me. I wanted it so badly that when he even considered putting a hand out, I grabbed it and shook his hand. The warmth brought back the dream from the hospital. I remembered touching his hand. For me, it was as if our skin melted into each other\u2019s for a split second. Touching him was like watching a scene from a movie, where the main characters realize they\u2019re madly in love from the moment they meet. They stare at each other as the world spins past them. The feel of his skin excited me; it meant he was real. I wasn\u2019t crazy or hallucinating.</p><p>He looked like he was in pain, touching me. My heart broke watching his response. Clearly the affection was one sided. Mine was more obsessions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice meeting you, uhhh\u2014\u201d I waited for him to answer his name.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAleksander. My name is Aleksander.\u201d</p><p>Mesmerized by him, I near whispered my sentence, \u201cAleksander, that\u2019s a nice name.\u201d His white-blue eyes flinched, hearing me speak his name. \"So strong.\" I blushed, realizing I'd said it aloud.</p><p>He fought a grin.</p><p>\"Well, it was nice meeting you.\" His slight accent was killing me. It was the cherry on top of the sexy sundae that was already irresistible, with his blue eyes and soft looking lips.</p><p>\"It was?\" I asked and continued to stare at his beautiful clear-blue eyes. I panicked at the thought of him leaving and blurted, \u201cNow that we have officially met, don\u2019t you want to talk about why I was on the floor throwing up?\u201d</p><p>He continued to fight his smile, still looking at me intently. I had noticed the giant 'get lost' he was sending my way, but I ignored it as I continued, \u201cI was drugged at a party. You were there. How do you know Shane?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know Shane, and I wasn\u2019t at the party. Who drugged you?\u201d</p><p>I wondered if he was toying with me. \u201cEveryone thinks YOU did,\u201d I said boldly.</p><p>His face dropped. \u201cI would never do such a despicable thing. Why would you say that? Besides, if I was apparently the one picking the vomit out, why would I save you after trying to kill you?\u201d</p><p>Unaware that we were still holding hands, I watched him seem to struggle with something. No doubt, it was that pale-skinned skinny girl with limp, blonde hair and cracked, chapped lips wasn't an appealing look.</p><p>I looked him deeply in the eyes; it was hypnotic. \u201cYou swear on my mom\u2019s grave that you never drugged me?\u201d</p><p>He flinched. \u201cGod, you don\u2019t kid around do you?\u201d He looked me severely in the eyes and squeezed my hand faintly. \u201cI have never and will never drug you. I could never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t taken a breath in a while and started to feel light headed. I wasn\u2019t entirely certain that it wasn\u2019t from being drawn to him more than anything in the entire world.</p><p>\u201cYou are so familiar to me,\u201d I whispered, still close to his face; his lips were inches from mine. I could feel the heat of his breath on my mouth. He dropped my hand, leaving it hanging in the air.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you dreamed of me, Aimee.\u201d He smiled the most delicious smile I had ever seen. He looked like he was struggling with something internally.</p><p>I backed away, needing to come out of the bubble we had somehow stepped into, where we were the only people in the world. \"I did dream of you.\"</p><p>\"When?\"</p><p>\"In the hospital. I swear I know you.\"</p><p>\u201cBeloved,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I was speechless. It had been a long time since anyone had said that word. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name, it means beloved.\u201d</p><p>I took another step away from him. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJe parle fran\u00e7ais.\u201d He just kept getting better.</p><p>\u201cWell, your name means great protector.\u201d I didn\u2019t know why I said it, but he started laughing.</p><p>\"I know what my name means.\"</p><p>\u201cMy mom called me beloved, all the time. Before she died.\u201d There was gloom in my voice I couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>He winced. \u201cHow did she die?\u201d He was making conversation and being nice to me, but I could see he wanted to escape. Now that I had finally found him, I wasn\u2019t going to make it so easy.</p><p>I never took my eyes off of him, as I spoke quietly, \u201cShe was driving from the city to here, and she started to get sleepy, I guess. Even though it was midday, she got out of the car on the side of the road. We don\u2019t know why. Sometimes she did some stretching when she got tired, so we think that's what she did. There was a trucker driving toward her and a dog ran out in front of him, a big dog, he said it was like a wolf. He swerved and lost control of the tandem trailers he was pulling. My mom was in front of the car when the back trailer swung around.\u201d</p><p>He cringed, seeing the pain on my face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I had never told the story. The words had never left my mouth. I didn\u2019t cry, like I thought I would. For some reason, I was happy he was the one I told.</p><p>\u201cShe was close to home too; that\u2019s the weird part. She was only about thirty minutes away. It was nine months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s tragic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was an art historian.\u201d The words just kept popping out.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThe most complete detailed biographies in history are art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my mom always said.\u201d A smile crept across my lips.</p><p>\u201cI guess art lovers all feel that way. I am a huge art buff myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was having a hard time guessing his age; he was a man, of that I was certain. But I couldn\u2019t imagine him being more than twenty-five. His face was young looking, but his eyes were wise.</p><p>\u201cWant to go for a coffee?\u201d I asked quickly, before he could end our conversation.</p><p>He frowned, trying to be polite. \u201cI really need to get going.\u201d</p> <p>I panicked wanting to grab his arm, drag him somewhere, and hold him hostage.</p><p>Seeing the desperation in my eyes, he softened for a second. \"I guess one quick coffee wouldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I felt my phone going off in my pocket and smiled. \u201cI need to tell my dad where we are going.\u201d I grabbed my phone and sent my dad a message, explaining I had gone for a coffee with a friend to talk about art.</p><p>I put the phone back in my pocket, certain my dad was texting me back. I ignored the texts and looped my arm into Aleksander's. I couldn\u2019t fight the urge to squeeze. His body was thick and muscled.</p> <p>He escorted me from the library, across the street to the caf\u00e9 called Cup O\u2019Feelin. It was our local jazz caf\u00e9, the only caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you reading now?\u201d he asked, looking down at me. His gaze burned through me. I felt things a little nerd like me had only ever scoffed at.</p><p>\u201cAncient medicinal practices. It\u2019s riveting,\u201d I replied, smiling. I didn\u2019t watch where I was walking and I didn\u2019t look around me; I walked trusting him. Something about him made me feel protected. I felt healthy again, somehow stronger.</p><p>He opened the door for me and waited as I walked through. I only took my eyes off of him for the second it took him to walk in behind me.</p><p>Adele was singing on the radio about love and hurting as we walked in. I could smell the coffee and fresh-baked treats. I hungered for something that wasn\u2019t on the menu. I wanted him to touch me. I envisioned him pulling his shirt off and then mine. Then his warm skin would be next to mine. I imagined him soft and smooth but hard under his skin. I blushed, nearly fanning myself, and smiled at the woman at the counter.</p><p>She smiled at Aleksander. \u201cWhy, hello there. See anything you like?\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to shout up and down. \u2018I do, I do.\u2019</p><p>Aleksander never took his eyes off of me. \u201cWhatever the lady is having.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, at him and spoke to her, \u201cSoy latt\u00e9 and a lemon tart, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemon for you, as well?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and handed the cash to her, but his eyes were locked on me.</p><p>We looked like Bambi and Faline, twitterpated, unable to be around normal people. At least, I did. The eye lock was frightening.</p><p>I sat down at the table he guided me to and watched him get our coffees and tarts. Lemon tart was normally my favorite treat, but I could barely taste it. I listened to him talk in a way that seemed nervous. I noticed the other women in the room were watching him as intently as I was.</p><p>\u201cSo, why are you visiting here?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cMaybe this is where I'm from.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo way. You\u2019re not from here, so start talking.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not from here.\u201d He laughed and bit into his tart. \u201cI am here for work. Just a couple weeks.\u201d</p><p>He started to chew. I had never noticed anyone eat before, except Brad Pitt in Ocean\u2019s Eleven, but this was better. His cheeks and jaw muscles flexed, while his lips glistened with the movement.</p><p>I was entranced until the words sunk in. \u201cWhat\u2014a few weeks? Then where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack home.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhere is home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s far away from here. God, this soymilk is disgusting.\u201d He grimaced making me laugh. It seemed like he was relaxing, if only a little.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an acquired taste. Start with chocolate; it\u2019s easier that way.\u201d Sipping my coffee was hard because my heart was panicking. He had a few weeks and that was it. I needed to know more about him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying, Aleksander?\u201d I wondered if he liked Aleks better.</p><p>\u201cI am staying with the family I\u2019m here helping. When my work with them is over, I will be on my way, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, confused. \u201cAre you like a social worker?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cExactly, like a social worker. I can\u2019t talk about it though\u2014it\u2019s confidential and I take that very seriously.\u201d Again the stern nature was back. He was better at putting up walls than I was.</p><p>I noticed for the first time he was wearing a beige shirt with a cross on it. \u201cAre you a Christian?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think of it like that. I try not to classify religion that way. I believe in God but maybe not church. The cross on my shirt is mine to bear; that\u2019s the meaning of the shirt.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI like it. That\u2019s a smart idea. Instead of assuming God and Jesus will save you and you can sin and say sorry for your crimes. This way your crimes are yours and yours alone.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his mug up and drank, making a face that made me burst into laughter. I noticed the women in the caf\u00e9 were also laughing at his face. I was getting a bit creeped out by the attention he was getting. \u201cIs it always like this?\u201d</p><p>He looked around. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women are staring at you. They look like they might attack at any second.\u201d</p><p>He smirked his sexy smile at me. \u201cFresh meat in a small town gets noticed. I could have three arms; to these women all I am is new. How do you feel about the boys in this small town? Do you judge them by the girls they\u2019ve already dated?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d I stuffed the last of my tart into my mouth and sucked back my latte. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He stood as I did and walked ahead to get the door for me. I loved that about gentlemen. When we were outside again, I nudged against him. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>He laughed but his eyes bore down on me. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>I sucked my next breath in as my eyes widened. It scared me how intensely I liked him after half an hour.</p><p>He nudged me back. \u201cI am reading Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, in Romanian.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cHow many languages do you speak?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cToo many to count.\u201d</p><p>I had felt proud until he had said that. \u201cI only speak four. But I\u2019m working on my fifth right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised the CIA hasn\u2019t scooped you up yet. You\u2019d be a good spy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re obviously not American. I can hear an accent. It's faint and only present on the slightest words. Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re very clever for what, eighteen?\u201d He was asking my age. This was a good sign.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI graduate in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>We walked, talking, as the backs of our hands brushed against each other.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you go after you graduate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUniversity in the city and then stay to work in the city, I guess. No more small towns.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about that. Leaving my dad seemed frightening now that my mom was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to be?\u201d he asked, staring out at the sea.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt was a doctor because I wanted to help people, but recently I went to visit a friend at Children\u2019s Hospital in the city and it broke my heart. Now I\u2019m not sure where I fit.\u201d</p><p>As we stopped at the end of the pier, he moved my hair out of my face that the wind had taken off with. \u201cYou\u2019re young. You will figure it out.\u201d His tone was filled with remorse and sadness.</p><p>I looked up into his eyes. They looked as if they had crystals inside. They sparkled with life. His face was that of a Greek statue from thousands of years earlier, perfect and chiseled. He looked strong\u2014fierce when he stood there by the sea. I could imagine him as a king or great leader. He suited the strength of his name, like a Viking standing at the helm of the Great War ship.</p><p>He looked down at me. \u201cYou\u2019re getting cold.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed I was getting cold. I had felt great. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t realize. I\u2019m still very weak.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWere you ill?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him trying to see if he was serious. \u201cI was drugged at a party. We had this conversation, remember?\u201d</p><p>He looked confused. \u201cYou were serious?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes. A man date-rape drugged my friend\u2019s drink, and she and I shared it. She is in liver failure now at Children\u2019s. She is the friend I was visiting there.\u201d</p><p>He looked very angry and concerned. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting. What happened after you took the drugs?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cThe memories are fuzzy, but we were each found in a pile of vomit, and she was taken to hospital right away. I, apparently, put myself to bed so everyone thought I was fine. But the way I remember it was that you were there, and I was choking, and you saved me by getting the vomit out of my throat. Then you cleaned me up and put me to bed.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt must have been a dream. The man who drugged you never got a hold of you though?\u201d He truly almost had me convinced I had dreamed him up.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t think so. But he\u2019s following me now. He is stalking me. He came after me in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\"Why were you in the woods?\"</p><p>I blushed and looked down. \"I was looking for you. The place where I saw you before\u2014I was in the woods there.\"</p><p>He grabbed my arms quite firmly, unexpectedly. \u201cYou need to be very careful then. You need to stay with other people and stay out of the woods. I can't always protect you.\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d What did he mean, protect me?</p><p>His grip loosened instantly. \u201cSorry, it just makes me so angry. I can't stand the idea of anyone hurting you. Or you being alone.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that sort of intensity or familiarity, but my cell phone was going wacky in my pocket. \u201cI have to get that.\u201d I pulled the phone out and looked at the dozen messages. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I dialed my dad quickly and looked back at him. \u201cExcuse me for a moment.\u201d I held up a hand and walked to the other side of the pier.</p><p>My dad answered in a panic. \u201cHello...Aimee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>He bellowed into the phone. \u201cDo you have any idea what I have been going through this last hour? I sent Shane looking for you. I almost called the police, young lady.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cSorry, I just got caught up in the conversation I was having. It was refreshing to be a normal kid for an hour.\u201d</p><p>He groaned into the phone. \u201cAimee, the coffee shop phoned and said you were having coffee with a strange man no one knows. He could be the psycho.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head as I looked down the pier at him. \u201cNo, Dad, he\u2019s not. I know his voice a little bit and this is not the guy. His mouth isn\u2019t the same, anyway. He\u2019s a fellow art lover from the library, not a crazed rapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, I want you home in the next half hour. You have school tomorrow and you\u2019re going, for the full day. God, I feel like I\u2019m talking to your sister, not you.\u201d He hung up the phone and I felt the guilt left dangling at the end of the conversation. My poor dad had been through enough. He didn\u2019t need me acting like Alise, to top things off. I looked back at the end of the pier for him. The pier held private moorage all summer long. It was starting to fill up, and in the midst of the boats and docks, I couldn\u2019t see him. I looked around, but I was alone.</p> <p>I tried to run back around the corner to see the entrance to the docks, but my side hurt too much. I slowly walked around, looking for him.</p><p>At the entrance, I saw Shane walking down the pier. He looked angry. I had forgotten about him completely, which seemed odd, considering the conversation we'd had.</p><p>He looked beautiful in his jeans and dark-blue t-shirt, which made his troubled blue eyes stand out more. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d Shane spoke firmly, taking my hand. He looked hurt, which made me feel sick. I hadn\u2019t done anything to feel guilty, technically.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWho?\"</p><p>\"The guy you were having coffee with.\" He didn\u2019t look fooled by the act.</p><p>\"I don\u2019t know. He was here and then he left. At least now I know who the guy with the crazy blue eyes from your party is. His name is Aleksander. How could you possibly know already that I was with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThelma at the coffee shop called your dad. Where is he?\u201d he ended the sentence angrily.</p><p>I shivered from the cold ocean air. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I phoned my dad and he was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that seem like the behavior of a nice guy?\u201d He raised an eyebrow at me.</p><p>I shook my head. I knew how hurt he was. I had not only ignored our conversation on the phone, but also hung out with another guy.</p><p>\"Shane, you know how badly I wanted to solve the mystery of the man from my memory.\" I tried to sound injured by his assumption.</p><p>\"I don\u2019t know an Aleksander. We need to get you home.\" He pulled me along the pier gently.</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak again on the drive to my place, what with all the confusion on both our parts lingering about. My dad was at the door when we pulled up.</p><p>\u201cHe was really worried, Aimee.\u201d His eyes burned down on me. \u201cI was worried too.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cI know. Thanks for the ride, Shane.\u201d I leaned over to kiss his cheek, but he turned his lips and pressed them into mine. It was my first kiss\u2014ever. He pulled me into him, kissing me a little harder. I kissed him back. It was a soft but passionate kiss, exactly the way I had always imagined a kiss would be. My heart did a flip and then a flop. He put his hand on my lower back and pulled me into his chest, crushing me. I winced in pain from my side as I breathlessly pulled away.</p><p>\u201cThink about what I said on the phone earlier.\u201d His eyes were aflame with desire. I almost leaned in for another kiss. I stopped myself, knowing my dad was watching the moment. I climbed out of the truck instead.</p><p>\u201cNight, Shane. Thanks.\u201d My dad waved as Shane waved back at him through my open door. \u201cNight, Mr. James. Night, Aimee.\u201d He didn\u2019t smile. He didn\u2019t need to. I knew what was racing through his mind. It was going through mine too.</p><p>I climbed the steps to my front porch and nodded to my dad. \u201cSorry, Dad. I didn\u2019t mean to worry you.\u201d</p><p>He put an arm around me. \u201cI really like that kid.\u201d</p><p>His smile was expectant. I knew he wanted details, but I shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s the best.\u201d</p><p>My dad winced. \u201cOoouuuu poor Shane, he\u2019s the best. It\u2019s too bad that he doesn\u2019t know you don\u2019t like him back. Do you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have an answer. I collapsed onto the couch. \u201cDaddy, I don\u2019t know what to do. A month ago, I had no boys. I had my books and Blake. Now I have too many boys to pick from, a stalker, a new bff who is a total moron, but I really love her, and I haven\u2019t read a book in weeks, and Blake\u2014wtf Dad? He\u2019s dating Alise, which I get\u2014she\u2019s hot, but come on... She\u2019s horrid.\u201d</p><p>The memory came back. I remembered lying in the grass thinking how handsome Shane was, telling him I didn\u2019t get why he liked my sister. He was staring at me the way he had before he kissed me. He was going to kiss me that night, before Alise came stumbling out onto the grass cussing like a pig, tripping everywhere.</p><p>\u201cHoney, no matter the number of daddies you say, which we both know I love, it won\u2019t solve your problems. You need some separation and time. Your sister is not horrid, Aimee. That\u2019s a cruel thing to say. She\u2019s just extreme and passionate in everything she does.\u201d He patted my head and went into the kitchen. I rolled my eyes at him.</p><p>I pulled a pillow over my face and screamed a little. I pulled the pillow off and sat up slowly. I was still nursing my side, which felt better than it had in ages. \u201cYou\u2019re right Dad. I need Emma.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cNo please\u2014anything but Austen.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, walking over to where my mom's movie collection sat. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, Sense and Sensibility. Marianne would have had a much better life if she had chosen wisely and picked Colonel Brandon over Willoughby. They had passion but it wasn\u2019t enough, and she nearly died. Whereas, Colonel Brandon loved her enough from the beginning, and if she had chosen prudently, she would have been spared that pain.\u201d</p><p>My dad sighed, as he made us both an omelet. \u201cWhen has the heart chosen wisely, my dear? As a scientist, I will say love is one thing for certain we will never understand, not fully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a big man, admitting that you don\u2019t completely understand the chemicals inside of us.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI like that Prejudice one better. I rather enjoy that Darcy fellow. He is a man after my own heart. Things seem simple with him. Can\u2019t we watch that?\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him over the couch. \u201cNo, it has no bearing on my love life at this moment. Her situation with Darcy and Wickham is nothing like mine. Neither of the boys I like is wicked like he is. Dad, I have never had a love life, but something has changed in me. I need to honor it with Austen, and I think, either Emma and the triangle with Frank Churchill and Mr. Knightly, or Marianne, Brandon and Willoughby.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI liked you better when you were more like me and less like your mom. How is it that you love the boy from the bookstore already?\u201d</p><p>I stuck my tongue out. \u201cLove at first sight, maybe. Sense and Sensibility then. Even you will cry.\u201d</p><p>\"Love at first sight isn\u2019t real, Aimee. It's called lust.\"</p><p>I cringed. \"Ew, Dad, Jeeze.\"</p><p>My dad laughed as he carried our plates of fruit and omelets into the living room while I set up the movie. We didn\u2019t have a huge TV or a great surround-sound system. We were \u2018fireplace and a good novel in hand\u2019 sort of people.</p><p>I had never been dramatic or caught in a triangle. It was not something I would ever have imagined for myself. I let go of the situation I was in and just enjoyed the movie with my dad. I think he might have even shed a slight tear towards the end.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>What hot guy? Oh right, my boyfriend.</p><p>School was boring the next day, until my sister followed me into the bathroom. \u201cOkay, spill. Who is everyone talking about? Who's the hottie?\u201d</p><p>I had been leaning against the sink, taking deep breaths. I was trying to get past the side stitch I seemed to have constantly where my liver was located. I thought about what I had eaten for lunch and knew the salad couldn\u2019t have been the issue. I was contemplating going to the doctor when I heard her voice. It caused me to straighten quickly. I nearly died from the pain of standing so sharply. Sweat crept along my brow.</p><p>She started primping in the mirror. She was wearing a tiny outfit I couldn\u2019t quite classify. \u201cIs that a mini dress, or a shirt you're wearing as a dress?\u201d I scowled at her.</p><p>She held her arms out, beaming, like I had complimented it or cared about fashion for even a second. \u201cYou like it? I got it a few weeks ago, but haven\u2019t felt like wearing it. Today felt like the right moment.\u201d</p><p>It was silver like her eyes and puffy at the bottom, but super short, showing off her long, lean legs. The shirt she had on was pale pink over top of the same silver as the skirt. As well, she had a jean jacket, strappy sandals, and a purple scarf on. The outfit was amazing, but a little over the top for twelfth grade, in a town that was famous for fishing and forestry.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at her. She was looking at my plain blue jeans and grey three-quarter-sleeve cotton shirt.</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cDo you have to wear that kind of stuff out of the house? It looks like pajamas.\u201d She plucked at my shirt leaving an indent in the cotton. \"Just let your hair down. It is really pretty down and long.\"</p><p>I grimaced. \"No. I like my bun.\"</p><p>\"Here, let me do your makeup.\"</p><p>I frowned at her and shook my head. I washed my hands and pulled my lip gloss out of my pockets.</p><p>\u201cUse some of my lipstick,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. I know where your mouth has been, first. Second, the last time you got to play West Coast Barbie with me, some freak tried to kill me. I\u2019m good with plain gloss and its subtle hint of pink, my slightly-stained gray cotton shirt, granny bun, and all of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rolled her eyes at me. \u201cGod, you are a drama queen. It was Giselle he was after, not you. You just got in the way, like always.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t usually let her get to me, but that had hurt a little. I raised my eyebrows at her and started to walk away, but she grabbed my arm. \u201cOk, that was mean. Anyway, who is this hottie you were spotted with?\u201d</p><p>I pulled my arm out of her grip. \u201cSome guy I met at the library. He\u2019s working here for a few weeks. We were talking books and art, you know\u2014fellow nerd.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, not him, the one you were at the caf\u00e9 with. Everyone has been talking about him since yesterday. Who is that one?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her reflection again. \u201cYou know, I like these geeks you hang out with. How are the geeks all hot?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and walked out of the bathroom. She still hadn\u2019t apologized for dating Blake, even when she had told me she wouldn\u2019t. I had decided we didn\u2019t need to be friends anymore.</p><p>I felt miserable and contemplated going back to the hospital. I decided they needed to check me out, in case things were not healing the way we had assumed they would.</p> <p>I walked from class, hearing my phone going nuts again. I pulled it out and looked at the thirty-five messages I hadn\u2019t read in the last few days. I looked at how many were from Blake; he was begging to talk to me. I bit the bullet and asked him to meet me at our math class right away.</p><p>I walked, thinking about Shane and the great kiss, and then Aleks and the amazing walk on the pier. I didn\u2019t know which one to pick. I wondered when either of them would see me for the little nerd I was, and back out. Maybe they would both go and things would go back to normal.</p><p>I still had no explanation for what was going on with Aleks and how it was that I had seen him. It was frustrating to have questions without any answers. And why had he said that about protecting me? It was all too confusing.</p><p>I was starting to feel like one of those girls who doodled her first name with the last name of the boy she liked instead of listening in class and learning. I shuddered at the thought.</p><p>I got to the class to find Blake sitting on the bench beside the door to class.</p><p>He was wearing a t-shirt with a Jesus fish with legs and a tail on it...the Darwin symbol. I laughed when I saw him. He was bent over his iPad and smiling.</p> <p>\u201cGuild chats?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou know it. We are arguing about whether having an Alliance character is traitorous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, but I will admit, I did for scientific purposes once. I wanted to see where all their secrets were and what the starts were like.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, contemplating what I was saying and started typing again.</p><p>He closed the iPad and put it in his backpack. He looked at me. \u201cI need to tell you something, and I need you to just listen to the whole thing before you slap me, leave, and never speak to me again.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSounds reasonable.\u201d</p><p>He put his head in his hands. I sat on the bench across the hall from him.</p><p>He sighed, clearly struggling with whatever he needed to say. \u201cLook, the night of the party, you and I went and sat in the sunroom at Shane\u2019s house. It was the make out room, kind of weird. Anyway, we were sitting there and you decided, at that moment, to tell me you loved me. I was shocked...I had no idea. I handled it badly because the truth is that I have been in love with your sister, forever. So, I told you I didn\u2019t feel the same way.\"</p> <p>I cringed inside.</p><p>His eyes were pleading with me. \"Aimes, I love you in a different way and when me and Alise break up, which we both know will happen, I hope you and I will still be friends. More than friends. Like before.\u201d</p><p>My jaw hung open the entire time he spoke. I was humiliated and speechless. I had no idea how to respond to the conversation.</p><p>He continued, \u201cI never would have acted on my feelings for her if I thought for a minute that you and I would stop being friends. I always thought you were in love with Shane. I saw the way you watched him; it was the same look I always got when I saw your sister. I thought maybe things with you and Shane would work out, and we could all be friends. Now I see that isn\u2019t likely to happen. It\u2019s my fault you went and drank with Giselle, it\u2019s my fault you drank poison, and it\u2019s my fault that everything is the way it is.\u201d He sighed, still holding his face, refusing to look at me.</p><p>I closed my mouth and pressed my lips together. I went to speak but chewed my bottom lip instead. I couldn\u2019t comprehend it all. I felt humiliated. I felt my wall come up. I just couldn\u2019t cope with anything else.</p><p>\u201cBlake, you have been my best friend my whole life. I wasn\u2019t in love with you, like I thought I was. I don\u2019t remember saying that to you, but it makes sense now why I went and drank with Giselle. I'm sure I was embarrassed. Sort of like I am now. I am sorry I told you that, because I am not sure we can ever come back from the place we are now. It\u2019s not that you handled it badly or that everything is your fault . . . I don\u2019t feel that way. It's that you lied to me. You acted one way and were another.\" I would have stood and walked away, but I couldn\u2019t; my legs were stuck.</p><p>He looked up at me and whispered in desperation, \u201cAimes, can you understand animal lust?\u201d His eyes were broken in a way I had never seen on his face.</p><p>\u201cI can now.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m a fraud and I know it, but for once, I want what the other kids have. I want to be part of the \u2018in\u2019 crowd...I want to be liked. I\u2019m tired of being that nerd. Your sister is beautiful, and I want to have a beautiful girlfriend, for once.\u201d</p><p>His words stung.</p><p>\u201cI need to go. Tell Mr. Milton I was sick, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like Shane, even though he dated your sister. Please forgive me, Aimee.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \"He never lied to me.\"</p><p>I ran down the hall before he could catch up with me. I ran down the driveway of the school and out onto the road. My side hurt a lot but I kept going. His words burned into my mind. I knew I was smarter and more confident than I was acting. I needed to be away from him.</p><p>I hated my sister so much. I walked to my mom\u2019s spot and sat on the side of the road. I looked at the mark I made in the tree. I clutched my side, panting. The pain had grown again. I wondered about going back to the doctor, but I was terrified to go back. I knew he was going to tell me I needed to go to Children\u2019s with Giselle and be on the donor list.</p><p>I looked around me, waiting for the wind to come.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even know what to say to my mom. I just knew I needed her. But her wind was gone. \u201cMom, please come back. I\u2019m sorry I was gone for so long. Please don\u2019t leave me now.\u201d Everything hurt so much, my heart, my side, and even my head a little.</p><p>\u201cAimee?\u201d I turned to see Aleksander walking toward me. He looked concerned.</p><p>I started to cry. \u201cI used to feel her here. She came and wrapped the wind around me. But she\u2019s gone now. I was gone for too long and she left me.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the ground beside me and wrapped his arms around me. His warmth pulled me into him as I sobbed. He rocked me and smoothed my hair whispering, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d It wasn\u2019t awkward in the slightest. It was exactly what I needed.</p><p>I started to feel better. I seemed to relax around him, and my body responded to his. He made all of the pains vanish. He was a stranger, but somehow I felt closer to him than I had any other person in my life.</p><p>\"It's going to be okay.\"</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay, because I\u2019m not ready. I still need her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she went to Heaven, Aimee. Maybe she is with the angels now.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, she was here for me for eight months and I almost never needed her. In the last month I have needed her more than ever and now she\u2019s gone. Why now?\u201d</p><p>Aleks didn\u2019t answer. He just tried to soothe me while I tried to get my frustrations out. I started to feel better. My chemical response to Aleks stopped my body from noticing my pain everywhere else.</p><p>\u201cWhat are some things you need to ask your mom?\u201d</p><p>I thought for a moment. \u201cWhy did you leave me?\u2014How will I know how to be a woman without you?\u2014What if I can\u2019t remember what you look like in five years?\u2014What if I forget your smell?\u2014What if I can\u2019t get past this and I ruin the rest of my life?\u2014Did you know you loved Dad from the moment you met him?\u2014Is safe love better than true love or are they the same thing sometimes?\u2014I don\u2019t know what I want to be anymore; I feel like if I choose sciences completely, I will lose the part of me that is you.\u2014Where did you hide the last jar of Grandma\u2019s pickled beets?\u201d</p><p>He started laughing. \u201cWhat beets?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. My face was full of tears. \u201cWe made a promise that we would only eat them when we were together. She hid the jars, so I couldn\u2019t eat them without her. But before we got to eat the last one, she died. I still can\u2019t find it, and my dad and I have scoured the house.\u201d</p><p>Aleks laughed harder. \u201cYou are the most intriguing person I have ever met. Ready to move on and walk a little ways?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \"Your butt must be getting sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Your weight and mine is too much to take on concrete.\u201d</p><p>We walked along the roadside, kicking rocks toward the ditch.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your mom?\u201d I asked, trying to distract myself. I felt foolish crying in front of him the way I had.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cShe was the most amazing mom ever. She made me feel loved every day. She was a very giving person. I only hope that I was able to be someone she was proud of, even for a time. Now, why were you so upset when I came upon you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI think it\u2019s that the feelings I\u2019ve had over the last little while are all coming to a head\u2014like I am coming to the end of a long journey, and I have to unpack from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. I like that about you. You\u2019re able to articulate what it is you\u2019re trying to say and then make a visual. The person listening gets a full picture of what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s because my sister doesn\u2019t read books without pictures. I always have to have a visual comparison available, or she will get lost.\u201d</p><p>We walked, laughing and talking, until we got to my house. My arm brushed the back of his, making my inside dance about.</p><p>\u201cWant to come in and meet my dad?\u201d I asked, hoping to have more time with him.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, I need to get going. I was walking in the other direction, when you distracted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \"Don\u2019t be. I'm glad I could be there for you.\"</p><p>Just as he was about to say goodbye, my sister's car pulled into the driveway. She was out and flashing her smile, before I could push him and shout 'run for it.'</p><p>\u201cWell, well. You must be the mystery man. I\u2019m Alise, Aimee\u2019s older sister.\u201d She put her hand out for him to take like she was the Queen. He turned her hand in his and shook it.</p> <p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Aleksander. It was nice meeting you\u2014see you later, Aimee.\u201d He let go of her hand. He smiled at me and walked away quickly.</p><p>We watched in silence as he walked hastily away from us.</p><p>\"Wow.\"</p><p>\"Yup.\"</p><p>\u201cOh my God! They weren\u2019t kidding\u2014he is hot. Wow, he looks like a celebrity. I feel so relaxed around him, like I know him from somewhere.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really notice me though, huh? Maybe I\u2019ll see if I can catch up with him. Maybe he wants a ride.\u201d She winked at me and ran back to her car.</p><p>She started it and drove off in the direction he went. I wanted to strangle her, but I went inside and ate coconut milk ice cream instead.</p> <p>I wished everyone could see her the way I did.</p><p>Blake sent a text asking if I was going to the party later. I ignored the message and watched the history channel. It was about the Tudors.</p><p>My sister never came home. She just left a message for our dad, saying that she was sleeping at Jaime\u2019s house, her new bff since Giselle had gotten sick. Jaime was another of the popular crowd my sister insisted on being attached at the hip with.</p><p>I tapped my foot and wondered if Aleks was going to the party. If my sister stopped him from getting to his destination with her tempting good looks, he probably would be going tonight. The thought of them kissing enraged me. I was starting to feel like a crazed psycho. I started to twitch my whole leg, thinking about whether to go or not.</p><p>My phone made another noise. I looked at the message from Shane now, asking if I wanted to go the party or just hang with him and watch a movie. The movie sounded pretty tempting at that moment. My sister could have Aleks if he was dumb enough to fall for her. My foot twitching reached a whole new level.</p><p>\u201cArggg.\u201d I stood up and stormed to my sister's bedroom to get a pretty outfit since my whole closet looked like it belonged to Wednesday Adams. I messaged Shane and told him to pick me up at nine. Then I went into my sister\u2019s room and picked only from the closet selection. I assumed if it was hung, she either cared for it or it was clean.</p><p>I grabbed at the hangers, looking for just the right look.</p><p>I found it at the back of the closet and I knew she loved it. I could recall her buying it with Giselle. I smiled, feeling evil boil in my blood as I stormed back to my room. I put the dress on and looked at myself, frowning. Who was I kidding? My long, blonde hair looked stringy, my eyes had dark circles under them, my chapped lips were still peeling and my thin, long face was making my nose look birdlike. My grey-blue eyes seemed to have a small amount of sparkle but nothing to write home about. The only thing working for me was that I had managed to gain back a bit of weight and I had breasts again. The dress looked pretty good on my body, but cutting off my head was not an option.</p> <p>I looked like an idiot.</p><p>I phoned Giselle.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Her voice sounded weaker than normal.</p><p>\u201cWere you sleeping?\u201d I felt bad.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cGod yes. All I do is sleep. What\u2019s shakin\u2019 bacon?\u201d</p><p>I laughed at bacon. \u201cI am going to a party tonight, stealing my sister\u2019s clothes, and I don\u2019t know how to do my makeup. I still look bad from being sick.\u201d I regretted saying it to her the minute I did, but she ignored it.</p><p>She burst out laughing. \u201cI have never been more proud than I am in this moment. Which outfit?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the dress, letting an evil grin cross my lips. \u201cThe red one. It still has the tags on it. It\u2019s from the back of her closet.\u201d</p><p>There was silence. \u201cOh my God. That\u2019s the one she got on harsh sale at Holt Renfrew in Vancouver. Ok, you\u2019re a beautiful blonde with plump lips and blue eyes in a red dress; you aren\u2019t going to need much. Is your face clean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a second.\u201d I wiped quickly with stolen makeup wipes from Alise's room. \u201cOk, clean slate. What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of materials am I dealing with here?\u201d Giselle sounded very serious in all of this.</p><p>I looked down at the old kit my mom gave me a year earlier and grimaced. \u201cYou know those kits you get from Walmart that have everything all in one? Like a painter\u2019s palette.\u201d</p><p>I heard a sigh. \u201cDear God\u2014I knew it.\u201d She went quiet for a moment and started to speak again, \u201cOk, this is what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p>She led me through the makeup, the hair, and the shoes.</p><p>When the doorbell rang and my dad called up at me, I whispered into the phone, \u201cThanks, Giselle. See you next week, ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, speaking of visits, are you bringing the new hottie in your life or just regular old Shane?\u201d Her voice was full of sarcasm.</p><p>I groaned. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with either of them. Shane likes me and we kind of kissed, but Aleksander is the guy I was telling you about with the crazy blue eyes. I\u2019m lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Aimee. He could be the psycho.\u201d She sounded panicked.</p><p>I shook my head, like she could see me. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not him. His lips aren\u2019t the same, at all. I think my sister has her claws in him already, anyway. So I guess Shane is the one for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he kissed you. Was that your first kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was nice.\u201d I blushed, smiling hard. I looked at myself in mirror and knew Shane made me happy. I could see my face transform talking about him.</p><p>She moaned. \u201cAwe, I\u2019m so bummed. I\u2019m missing your first party with a boyfriend, sort of. Good luck tonight. Don\u2019t drink anything you didn\u2019t open.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYeah, lesson learned.\u201d I hadn\u2019t told her or anyone about Aleks, but it seemed the news had traveled even to a children\u2019s hospital in the city. Sad really. Damn Facebook.</p><p>I hung up my phone and stuffed it down the top of the dress, to the side of my boobs, like my sister always did. She was classy like that. I left the room and started down the staircase. I was one of those cheesy movies. Overly made-up girl, walking down the stairs. She's a nerd transformed into hottie. Her date is at the bottom, staring up at her the whole way down.</p><p>I focused more on the stairs than anything. The shoes Giselle picked were high heeled, and I was feeling very unstable. On the stairs, I realized my side cramps were back. I was feeling bloated and sort of gross, but I pushed it aside. I hoped Shane and I would have fun, and that maybe I would see Aleksander again.</p><p>\u201cDear God...what are you wearing? Go put something on,\u201d my dad groaned at me.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cDad, Alise wears less to church.\"</p><p>He rolled his eyes at me and sighed. \u201cIf Alise went to a church, it would light on fire instantly. Besides, you\u2019re my jeans and t-shirt daughter. I expect certain things from you. Just like I expect certain things from her, my high-heel wearing daughter. You\u2019re not supposed to interchange like this.\u201d</p><p>I kissed my dad on the cheek and looked at Shane, who smiled like he was a kid who just got his favorite toy.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing, but your dad\u2019s right. You look a bit like your sister tonight. I like you better the other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that you said that.\u201d I smiled back at him, taking his arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to need your arm tonight\u2014these shoes are death.\u201d</p><p>\"They make you tall.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, they weren\u2019t even the highest in the closet. I think these are like four-inch heels.\"</p><p>He looked. \"I'd say...at least. You're almost as tall as I am, and I'm over six feet.\"</p><p>My dad looked worried. \"Have fun. Take the shoes off if they hurt your feet.\"</p><p>\u201cNight, Dad.\u201d I laughed and waved back at him as we left out the front door.</p><p>He shook his head and waved us off. \u201cPlease take it easy and slow. Drink nothing. Shane, do not take your eyes off of her, no matter what. For Christ sake, Aimee, please for the love of God and all things holy, do not go into any woods. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Just call me Jessica Fletcher, with a cramp</p><p>The party was at some girl\u2019s house I didn\u2019t really know. I knew who she was, but I had not spoken to her since second grade. Her name was Michelle Mitchell and she had a party every month, when her parents left for the city. They had been having a date night once a month since she got old enough to stay home alone. My sister had been partying at their house for the last two years. The Mitchells didn\u2019t seem to mind the partying, as long as there was no mess. To me it was not responsible parenting.</p><p>As we pulled up to the house, Shane leaned over to me. \u201cYou look very pretty, so I want you to stay glued to my side all night. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He kissed me softer than he had before, and I felt his tongue slip into my mouth. It was an exciting feeling. I kissed him back, moving the way he did, until his hand moved up into my hair pulling me into him more.</p><p>\u201cNot here, okay?\u201d I pushed against him.</p><p>He reached down and kissed the side of my throat once. I didn\u2019t know what to do to get my inner calm back. My pheromones were going nuts on his.</p><p>He opened his door and came around to my side to open my door for me. He growled as he helped me out of the truck and kissed me once more. \u201cThat dress is driving me nuts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I find it a tad disgusting when people get so wrapped up in looks.\"</p><p>He took my hand and smirked. \u201cWell you\u2019re lucky then, because I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re that good looking. I\u2019m attracted to your personality, and maybe the small hope you\u2019ll do my trig homework.\u201d</p><p>I hit him in the arm, hurting my hand. We walked up to the house, but before we got to the door he stopped me. He looked at me intensely. \u201cAimes, I\u2019m not trying to pressure you, but I just want to know what you\u2019re thinking about us and everything.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. It was a fair request. \u201cI am confused right now, Shane. I went from living my quiet life with no friends or boys interested in me, to dating you, sort of, and my best friend being a girl in a hospital bed dying. You dated my sister and now my bff is dating my sister. I\u2019m leaving for college in a few months and my mom died nine months ago. Some freak is stalking me. This has all happened really quickly for me, and I don\u2019t feel caught up. So, right now, I can offer you what we are now, dating, sort of.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me again. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think about how much you were coping with, which is selfish, but I will take anything I can get, right now.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him and walked through the door he opened for me.</p><p>The party was loud and annoying, and I couldn\u2019t help but think about how much I was going to hate it. There were drunken teenagers everywhere mixed with loud music. There were people making out in one corner and others doing shots in another.</p><p>I looked back at Shane as he glided me through the door. His smile reassured me.</p> <p>I looked around for my sister and hoped I wouldn\u2019t see Aleks with her.</p><p>I didn\u2019t see her anywhere, which made me concerned.</p><p>I let Shane put his hand on my back through the entryway and then step in front of me and take my hand. He pulled me along, through the mass of drunken teens.</p><p>The smell of smoke and pot filled my nostrils as we walked one way. I looked over at the kids who were sitting in a circle on the back deck with the screen door wide open. They were passing joints and cigarettes after taking a hit. I felt my lips twist into a look of severe disapproval.</p><p>Shane laughed at my face. \u201cOkay, let's walk this way.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me away from the kitchen and the smell as I started to rant. \u201cDo they have any idea how many toxins and narcotics they\u2019re breathing in at that moment? There are four thousand chemicals in a cigarette, forty-three of them are known cancer-causing toxins like weed killer and bug spray. They could just suck on the can of DDT. And don\u2019t even get me started on the marijuana! It can raise your heart rate anywhere from twenty to one hundred percent and cause heart attacks. And it has more cancer-causing chemicals than a cigarette.\u201d</p> <p>Shane raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cYou\u2019re really fun at parties.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at him. \u201cCancer is a serious problem, not only for health reasons, but also on the costs it presents to the economy. Did you know there is even an increase in dogs with cancer since smoking has become a national pastime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can dress you up like one, but you will never be one.\u201d He smirked and looked around the party. \u201cWant to get out of here?\u201d</p><p>His eyes had a gleam to them, which told me he had plans other than dropping me off. Like the releasing of the hounds, butterflies raced around my stomach. I shook my head. \u201cCan we stay for a couple minutes longer?\u201d I felt guilty that I wanted my hot, new \u2018sort of boyfriend\u2019 to stay at a party in hopes I would get to see the one guy I couldn\u2019t get out of my mind.</p><p>He nodded, showing a minuscule amount of disappointment in that request.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what I would find when I did finally locate my sister. I sort of assumed she would be sitting on the stairs somewhere dressed like a whore. Blake would be kissing her neck from the back and Aleks would be kneeling and kissing her hand. Her beauty would mesmerize them. She would sip from her drink and smile that wicked-stepmom grin she had mastered when we were little. She always focused on the wrong part of the classics.</p><p>I looked back at Shane, feeling reassured. He had, at least, crawled his way from the pit of despair and unrequited love with my sister. He was not under her spell.</p><p>I stood beside Shane as he held my hand protectively and chatted with Tommy.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit\u2014Aimee James, is that you? Damn, I thought we had a new girl at the party and I was wondering how Shane found her first. You want to dance?\u201d His wide smile and pointed eyebrows reminded me of the bad guys on my Saturday morning cartoons.</p><p>I looked at Shane, whose breath had started to increase. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to dance, T.J.\u201d</p><p>Tommy shrugged his filthy smile. His eyes never seemed to reach my eyes. \u201cWhen you get tired of this, you know where to find me.\u201d He turned and walked away, making a howl like a wolf. Everyone at the party howled with him. I felt like an outsider with no initiation yet on Crazy Island. The ritual was going to be something I wasn\u2019t willing to bargain on.</p><p>Shane leaned into me. \u201cSorry, ignore him. I think most people do. I\u2019m going to get a drink of water. Want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the tap and clean glass from the cupboard?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>As he walked away I felt the warm wind hit me. I looked around as my sister walked through the front door with Blake. She was wearing her usual uppity self-indulgent smirk. It was full of the knowledge that she could have any guy in the room, and you were lucky she let you keep yours.</p><p>Blake looked uncomfortable but true to form. He wore a grey t-shirt with a symbol of an atom on it. His dark hair was styled, and without his glasses, his blue eyes were brighter than ever. He had on baggy cargo pants I didn\u2019t recognize and a watch that was most definitely not his NASA space camp one. My sister had started to put her tastes on him; like a puppet, he wore what she wanted. He saw the look of distaste on my face and slid his hand behind his back. He was ashamed of his new watch, which oddly was enough for me. I was glad to see that a small amount of the person I had always adored was still inside of him.</p><p>Alise wore a bright purple party dress. She outshone me, of that there was no doubt. I tried not to think about the fact, and I put a smug look on my face. She rounded the room to where I was standing.</p><p>\u201cNice dress, little sister.\u201d Her perfectly manicured right eyebrow lifted. Her lips glistened with a berry-colored lipstick under an inch of gloss. She was so gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to age prematurely if you don\u2019t stop wearing so much make-up.\u201d</p><p>She looked unfazed and glanced down at the dress. \u201cI WAS taking it back, but since you like it so much, you can keep it.\u201d</p><p>I gulped, trying not to let her get to me, but her face lit up. \u201cAhhh and here comes another one of my leftovers you seem to like. Hello, Shane.\u201d It stung.</p><p>I felt the warmth of him come up behind me. \u201cHello, Satan. You know, without the horns, it's deceiving. Maybe you should wear them year round, instead of just on Halloween.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her response to being called Satan. She bounced back, taking a deep breath. \u201cYou can keep him, Aimee, and the dress. Thank me later.\u201d She batted her long false lashes at us and grabbed Blake by the belt buckle. She dragged him through the crowd of people. He tried to make eye contact with me but I ignored him.</p><p>\u201cCan we go now?\u201d Shane asked watching her walk away and be swallowed up by the crowd.</p><p>I nodded, taking my water and drinking it quickly.</p><p>I looked over at Jaime, my sister\u2019s friend. She was holding a glass in her hand and leaning against the wall in the dining room. She was staring off into space and seemed to be swaying like she was on a boat. It wasn\u2019t even ten o\u2019clock yet. The glass looked the same as the one Giselle and I drank from. The one the police had shown me.</p><p>I felt my chest tighten. I recognized the look in her eyes. It was what I\u2019d seen in the mirror, after I\u2019d been revived. Aleks was holding me in the mirror at Shane's. My face looked exactly the same.</p><p>She was either crazy drunk or she had been drugged. I looked at Shane, who was talking with a guy named Murray. I tapped him lightly to interrupt and whispered, \u201cI think the date rapist has struck again. Does Jaime look like I did?\u201d</p><p>Shane looked around the room scanning for her. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>I pointed to where she had been. \u201cThe dining room.\u201d I didn\u2019t see her anymore, but I knew she couldn\u2019t have gone very far.</p><p>I walked through the foyer into the dining room and looked around. There were people everywhere. Someone must have seen her leave.</p><p>I asked a girl leaning against the wall, \u201cHave you seen where Jaime went?\u201d</p><p>Her face grew confused, as she looked around. \u201cWas she in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I sighed and walked back to Shane.</p><p>He looked concerned. \"Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see her. I want to look around and see if she went out to the deck to throw up or something.\u201d I walked away before he could talk me out of it. I held my breath as I entered the kitchen, scowling at the idiots smoking on the deck. I peeked through the open doors. Jaime was nowhere to be found.</p><p>I walked back to the dining room and went down the hallway. I looked in each bedroom and bathroom, but there wasn\u2019t anyone around. I slipped down the stairs in the hallway to the basement, literally, as the stupid shoes caught on the carpet.</p><p>The hall was dark and the loud music made it impossible to hear anyone, so I didn\u2019t bother yelling for her.</p><p>I peeked into the bathroom but it was empty. \u201cProbably peeing outside, the dirty savages,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>I opened the guest bedroom door to see struggling on the bed. I panicked, flicking on the lights. \u201cGet off her!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>Michelle Mitchell, the hostess and her boyfriend scowled at me. \u201cTurn out the lights, pervert.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, flicking them off and locking the door from the inside before closing it.</p><p>I took a deep breath as I stared at the closed wooden door. I would always be the girl who walked in on them. I nodded to myself and continued down the dark hallway. I felt like Nancy Drew, but maybe a little sleazier-looking in my red dress. I opened the door to the garage and reached my hand into the darkness. I felt nervous sticking my hand in, feeling alongside the wall until I found the light switch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAimee.\u201d</p><p>I jumped turning, as the lights flicked on. I smiled to see Aleks standing in the hall outside Michelle's guest room.</p><p>He was frowning at me, but his white-blue eyes were all I noticed.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Aleks. What are you doing here?\u201d I knew Alise would have invited him. It burned inside of me.</p><p>\u201cWorrying about you and the reckless things you do when I\u2019m not around. What are you doing down the dark hallway of the house party, full of drunk teenagers and dressed like that?\u201d he scolded me.</p><p>I laughed, looking into the garage. \u201cYou sound like my dad and Shane. I\u2019m fine, but I will admit, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here\u2014this garage is spooky. I\u2019m sure Jaime, my sister's friend, has been drugged, so I\u2019m looking for her. If she's not drugged, she's drunk off her ass and that's probably not safe with a pervert on the loose.\u201d</p><p>The garage was empty, but the door to outside on the far wall was opened just a sliver, making a whistling sound.</p><p>\u201cLet me go first.\u201d Aleks walked into the garage, looking around at the tools and motorcycle. He grabbed a crowbar off of the bench where tools were scattered and crept through the open door. The cool, night air was full of crickets and frogs singing. I looked around, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the dark of the backyard. Aleks put his hand out for mine. I looked at it, feeling guilty about Shane. I felt the sizzle of our skin touching and wondered if he ever felt it too, or if I was the only one falling. I rationalized that holding his hand as a safety precaution. I also reminded myself that he would be gone in a few short weeks, whereas Shane would be with me at least until the end of the summer.</p> <p>Our feet made little to no noise on the damp grass as we looked around, scanning the back yard.</p><p>I heard a rustling and a muffled sound to my right. It was down the yard a ways.</p><p>Aleks looked at me. \u201cStay here,\u201d I shook my head, pleading with my eyes. I was terrified.</p><p>He sighed, resigning to the fact that I needed to come. He let go of my hand and put his pointer finger to his lips. I nodded.</p><p>He walked with the crowbar in his hands toward the sound. I crept along behind him, nearly peeing my pants, or panties rather\u2014damned dress.</p><p>We heard more trees and branches moving to the right of us, in the small patch of bush next to Michelle\u2019s house. It was more like brush in between the houses for privacy, as opposed to a forest.</p> <p>I heard a crying sound and walked toward it, as Aleks took off running after the other sound.</p><p>I looked, trying desperately to see, but the moon had not come out to help out with the light.</p><p>\u201cJaime, is that you?\u201d I whispered. I was angry that Aleks had left me to wander alone through the brush. I hoped he caught whoever had dragged Jaime into the bushes.</p><p>She was on the ground in a small clearing, with her shirt torn. I could barely see in the dark, but I reached for her. As I got right beside her, I could see she was on her stomach and her face was covered in vomit.</p><p>\u201cHelp us, someone help us, please,\u201d I called out into the night. I was scared about giving away my location, but I was even more scared that Jaime had been drugged with the bad batch of drugs. I was certain she had been at least partially raped by the look of her pale legs parted and her skirt up to her waist. I pulled the skirt down, tucking it around her naked bum, and felt like throwing up again.</p><p>\u201cPlease, help me. Someone.\u201d I started to cry. I was scared. I was not the right person to be handling that moment.</p><p>I patted her back. \u201cJaime, it's okay. Someone will come and help you.\u201d She moaned into the dirt.</p><p>The potheads started looking over the railing. \u201cHey, you down there, are you okay?\u201d one stoner asked.</p> <p>I sobbed. \u201cCall 9-1-1 and tell them we need police and ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, man. Is someone hurt?\u201d he asked again. No one on the deck appeared to be moving.</p><p>\u201cJUST FUCKING PHONE.\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, God\u2014she\u2019s kind of bitchy.\u201d Pothead one spoke slowly.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d Pothead two muttered.</p><p>I sat on the grass, certain my leg was brushing against her vomit. I turned her on her side and pulled her clothes around her more.</p><p>Someone came running down the yard.</p><p>\u201cAimee?\u201d Shane cried out into the night panicked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Aimee\u2014are you okay?\u201d His voice was stricken with grief.</p><p>I nodded, even though he couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cYeah. It's Jaime.\u201d</p><p>He knelt on the ground beside me and touched my shoulder. \u201cFor Christ sake, Aimee. I was so scared when you left. I thought you were going to look in the kitchen; I didn\u2019t know you were leaving the house. You never said you were leaving the house. I told you not to leave my side.\u201d</p><p>He took his shirt off as he ranted and wrapped it around Jaime. He picked her up and carried her up to the house. I followed him around the side to the front yard. Kids were streaming from the house. Some were running from the front door, hoping not to be busted by the cops for underage drinking. Most of the others were trying to figure out what was going on, as the yard was filling with emergency lights.</p><p>The ambulance was there first, rolling into the driveway very slowly, so as not to hit any of the kids mulling about.</p><p>I had grabbed Jaime\u2019s hand when her head went floppy against Shane\u2019s bare chest.</p><p>The outside lights flicked on and Michelle came running out in a panic. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Who called the cops?\u201d she was angrily shouting at the men getting out of the ambulance. \u201cGet off my property. You need a warrant to come on here.\u201d</p><p>They ignored her completely and walked to where Shane was holding Jaime.</p><p>Michelle froze, watching as a stretcher was carried to where Jaime was. The men started to work on her. Shane put her down gingerly on the stretcher and stepped back, as a blanket covered Jaime. I couldn\u2019t get the vision of her two white legs stretched out behind her in the dark woods. I imagined it was going to take me some time before I got past the entire spring. Shane spoke to the two paramedics, no doubt explaining the situation with care so no one else would hear.</p><p>He walked to me and put his arm around me. We both smelled of her vomit and were covered in dirt.</p><p>He whispered in my neck, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you.\"</p><p>I shook my head, trying desperately to ignore the tears streaming down my face. \"You were right. I shouldn\u2019t have left without you.\"</p><p>He held me tighter. \"You saved her, Aimes.\"</p><p>We watched in silence, as they took Jaime away. The police had arrived and were asking questions of the paramedics who remained. They all pointed in our direction.</p><p>Constable Bindley and Corporal Williams made their way to us with grim looks on their faces.</p><p>\u201cAimee and Shane, want to come with me? The rest of the guys are going to stay here, take pictures, and talk to the kids that are left,\u201d the corporal asked.</p><p>I nodded as Shane spoke, \u201cYou want to see where we found her?\u201d</p><p>Williams nodded. \u201cYup, and the exact path you took to get her here.\u201d</p><p>Shane pointed. \u201cI came around the side of the house this way, and walked up the grass from the backyard.\u201d</p><p>Williams pulled out a huge, long, black flashlight that looked more like a baseball bat. He walked around where Shane told him. He looked down at the ground carefully, the entire way down the back lawn.</p><p>\u201cWho found her?\u201d he asked, as we walked back to the spot slowly, so he could look around.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cI did. I saw her at the party, and she looked bad. I just knew something was wrong. She had the same cup I remembered Giselle and I drank out of\u2014you guys showed us. Anyway, I ran around looking for her for about fifteen minutes and I ran into Aleks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was here?\u201d Shane asked roughly, his hand biting into my arm.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah, I met up with him on my search for Jaime. He came with me. We were walking down here and when we got to about here\u2014\u201d I stopped and pointed to the bush. \u201c\u2014We heard a noise there. Aleks ran after whomever it was with a crow bar\u2014\u201d I stopped, realizing he had never come back. I felt my eyes widen as I spoke, \u201cHe never came back. Do you think he\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Williams shook his head. \u201cNo, either way, he\u2019s in trouble now. He\u2019s probably looking at an assault charge now. He probably never came back when he saw the lights. Who is this Aleks?\u201d</p><p>Shane crossed his bare arms looking at me defiantly. \u201cYes, who is he?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s a social worker of some sort from the city working here for a family he helps.\u201d</p><p>Williams shook his head. \u201cIf he comes near you again, Aimee, you need to phone me right away. There is no such thing as a social worker from the city coming to a small town. We have our own here. They are government workers like me. They work where they\u2019re assigned. He\u2019s a suspect right now, and I want you to treat him as such. What\u2019s he look like?\u201d</p><p>I gulped as Shane started spewing out the facts. \u201cTall like me, white like me, built like me, blue eyes, dark-blond hair shorter than mine, clean cut. That\u2019s what all the women in town say anyway.\u201d he spoke through his teeth.</p><p>Williams clicked on the radio at his collar. \u201cDispatch I need a BOLO put out on a young man, early twenties, late teens, Caucasian, dark-blond hair, blue eyes, six foot two, muscular build, seen fleeing from 1942 Elder Grove Road\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack jacket and blue jeans.\u201d My voice was hollow.</p><p>\u201cSeen wearing a black jacket and blue jeans.\u201d</p><p>I pointed to the woods as he finished. \u201cIt was right here.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to walk back in there. Shane put an arm around me, as Williams walked very carefully into the brush. He stopped when he reached the spot.</p><p>Bindley came down the yard. \u201cCorporal, you need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, I need some lights and some pictures.\u201d His voice was solid and steady and I wondered how he did it. I was sickened, just guessing what had happened. He was going to have to pick it all apart, until he got a story from all the gory details. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Bindley and a few other police officers came down, Williams looked at Shane and I. \u201cOkay you two, we are going to need some statements. You know how this works. Shane, take her home, and we will meet at her house in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Home did sound good; retelling the disgusting story, however, did not.</p><p>It was worse than I imagined it would be.</p> <p>My dad rubbed my shoulders while my sister sat on the couch, staring at me, horrified, as I told every moment of the party. I left nothing out, including whom I had seen there. Counting Aleks, who was wanted for questioning. I had disputed his involvement in her attack, as he had been with me while someone was obviously attacking her.</p><p>Corporal and Shane had both agreed that he could have been an accomplice. I disagreed and asked if he had been an accomplice, why would he have brought me right to the scene of the crime? To which they both agreed that he did it to clear his name.</p><p>It did seem off that he had been at both places when the drugging happened. It seemed even more off that I had been the only person who had seen him. It was even weirder that he had lied to me about saving my life. I remembered that\u2014I was positive. I assumed it was because he didn\u2019t want me to know he had seen me naked.</p><p>I went to bed that night after taking the longest shower in recorded history. I threw the red dress out, feeling no remorse for its untimely death. My head whirled around and around, playing the same pictures and \u2018what ifs\u2019 until finally I fell asleep.</p><p>I woke, feeling more tired than I had been when I fell asleep. I looked at the time and cringed. I had been asked to come down to the police station to look at some pictures of criminals at eleven, and it was six minutes to. I jumped out of bed feeling woozy, as if I would black out. I sat back on my bed as the stars from my eyes cleared and I nearly got sick all over my floor. I took a few deep breaths and got up slowly to get dressed.</p> <p>My dad got a worried look on his face when he saw me coming down the stairs. \u201cYou look funny, kiddo. You still tired?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, yawning. \u201cYeah, I am exhausted. What time did I go to bed?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the clock. \u201cTwelve hours ago. This must be draining you, all this craziness. You ready to go? Shane just pulled up.\u201d</p><p>I looked out the window at his truck and nodded. I struggled with the walk over to my shoes. \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t want to do this. I know Aleks isn\u2019t a bad guy. I have better instincts than that.\u201d</p><p>My dad smiled; it was weak, and not even close to convincing. \u201cYou are a smart girl, but I think some of the darker elements in our world can fool even the wisest of us. When you get home, it's bed for a couple days, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I wanted to go back to bed right then.</p> <p>He passed me a banana as I walked out the door. I hadn\u2019t been eating again, and I could feel the weight falling off of me after only a few days. The stress was bad for my health. I hated being so scrawny. I pulled my long locks into a loose braid and struggled down the front steps.</p><p>Shane got out and opened the door for me. \u201cYou look beat, Aimes. After this is over, I think you need some serious rest. The big dance is on Friday.\u201d</p><p>I scowled, not realizing so much time had passed since the whole poisoning thing. \u201cI think they should cancel it. What with everything that\u2019s going on, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, normal is what we need right now. They just need to make sure the security is upped.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak on the ride over. I was annoyed and feeling sour. I flipped down the sun visor to look in the mirror on the back of it. I did look awful, with huge bags under my eyes and puffy eyelids. My lips even looked a bit swollen. I didn\u2019t need help in the puffy-lip department.</p><p>I glanced at Shane. I didn\u2019t know what to do about my feelings for him. I didn\u2019t know what they were anymore. I was too tired to care.</p><p>We went inside the first door of the small brown building, to a waiting area surrounded by plastic bulletproof windows.</p><p>We were brought to where the corporal sat at a desk, on the phone. He hung up and grinned. \u201cWe have a database of drifters and criminals from the area, if you just want to take a quick look to make sure Aleks isn\u2019t in one of them. That would make our job a lot easier.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded as he stood up and walked out of his office. \u201cOkay, the computer is over here that you can look at. It\u2019s pretty straightforward. You scroll down and click next page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. How\u2019s Jaime this morning?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSame thing as you and the other girl. She is out like a light, no signs of waking up, and vomited for hours before passing out completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she raped?\u201d The words left my mouth like I was spitting out a bad taste, but I had to know.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t disclose that kind of information, sorry. She\u2019s lucky you guys arrived when you did. I\u2019ve had my men searching with the dogs for your friend Aleks and his crowbar. Nothing but the crowbar has turned up. The dogs haven\u2019t found a single scent to track, even off the crowbar.\u201d</p><p>Shane frowned. \u201cYou found it near the house?\u201d</p><p>The corporal nodded. \u201cTwo hundred yards over, with no trace of anything on it. It wasn\u2019t used anyway. The reason I am telling you this is that he may seem like a nice guy, but I want you to ask yourself why didn\u2019t anyone else see him that night? Why didn\u2019t he come back to make sure you were okay when he didn\u2019t catch the guy? Why would he leave you with a hurt, young woman in the bush alone in the first place? Especially if he had no intention of catching the person who hurt her.\u201d</p><p>I felt sick to my stomach as his words whirled around in my head. They made perfect sense, but my heart defended Aleks.</p><p>I scrolled through the photos, ugly mug shots of seedy-looking people. In the background, I could hear the corporal try to sell the police force to Shane in the far corner. He sounded like a recruiter.</p><p>After a while, I heard them walk back to me. \u201cHow\u2019s it going in here?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cNo, no, and more no. He isn\u2019t in here.\u201d</p><p>Williams shrugged. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t always strike gold with the first hit. Keep in touch about anything you remember, and I\u2019ll let you know anything I can.\u201d</p><p>The corporal picked up the brochure for becoming a cop and handed it to Shane. \u201cSon, I\u2019ve never told a single person they should take a look at this. I think you\u2019ve got something.\u201d</p><p>Shane smiled. \u201cThanks. I will look at the website tonight.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door and we left. The cold air didn\u2019t seem to snap me out of the haze I\u2019d gotten stuck in.</p><p>\u201cI need some sleep, Shane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you home now.\u201d He opened the truck door and helped me inside. I felt everything but noticed nothing.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>A is for Adultery, Infidelity, Treachery, Faithlessness...</p><p>I dreamed that I was walking on a beach, my hand was being massaged, and the air was filled with soft music. The sand filled the spaces between my toes with every step. I couldn\u2019t hear the waves very well, but the soft music seemed to ride the wind in waves. Moments it was louder, then soft again.</p><p>\u201cAimee,\u201d the music sang. \u201cAimee, you need to wake up. I don\u2019t have much time left, and I need to talk to you.\u201d It sounded less like music, and I knew I wasn\u2019t dreaming. My toes no longer felt the sand, only sheets and my head was on a pillow with drool under my lips. I licked my lips, frowning. I could feel the headache behind my eyes. It felt like I had been drugged again.</p><p>I moaned, \u201cNot again.\u201d</p><p>I heard a chuckle beside me. It was a sound I loved. I smiled and opened one eye. As the fog cleared and my vision started to focus, I opened my mouth to scream. His hand went to my lips.</p><p>Aleks was holding me hostage. I looked around the room, realizing I was still at home. He was in my room.</p><p>His intense blue eyes pleaded with me while his hand covered my open mouth. I didn\u2019t like people\u2019s hands near my mouth, and this was twice with him. I cringed, closing my lips.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Aimee, don\u2019t scream. Let me explain.\u201d His voice was a whisper.</p><p>I nodded. I was in too much pain to scream anyway. My heart was beating out of my chest but I wanted to hear what he had to say. For whatever reason, I couldn\u2019t be afraid of him. His lips moved sensually as he started to speak again. My eyes darted around the room, taking notice of my open window. He had climbed up and inside to talk to me. I started to get worried again, even though somehow I knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt me.</p><p>Even if he did, my family was downstairs. At the very least, my sister could attack with curling irons and hairspray, and he would get one hell of a makeover.</p><p>He never pulled back from hovering too close to my face.</p><p>\u201cDoes your head hurt?\u201d he asked, looking worried.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cReally bad, I think something is wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>He put his hands up to my head. \u201cI can\u2019t heal you, but I can take the pain from your head. You've been doing it a lot lately, too much. You're tired.\u201d</p><p>His words made no sense to me and I wanted to pull away, but his touch on my head sparked feelings everywhere.</p><p>His hands were burning. My head nearly broke into a sweat as he touched either side. His eyes stayed focused on me. I couldn\u2019t tear my gaze away from his smile. His upper lip was fatter on one side making his lips always crooked. I wanted to suck that top lip. I blushed, realizing what I was thinking about and cleared my throat as he pulled his hands away.</p><p>He smiled with the bigger side only, giving me the crooked smile. \u201cIs it gone?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t remember what we had been talking about, but I nodded anyway, mesmerized.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t snap out of the way he made me feel. My nerdy, geeky body was responding to him in ways I didn\u2019t know how to operate. I needed a manual.</p><p>Something about him being close to my bed, and me being in nothing but my panties and a tank top, made me think about him sliding into the sheets with me. His mouth was moving again. I decided this was my new favorite thing to watch.</p><p>\u201cAimee, snap out of it.\u201d He raised his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I switched back to reality. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve been funny lately.\u201d I tried to cover up the fact that I was becoming like a guy and blood was starting to leave my head. I felt ashamed. I had decided he was a bad guy and there I was, falling for the bad guy, when I had a very good guy who was falling for me. I was becoming Alise.</p><p>He looked distracted by me too. His eyes were burning as he watched me. I realized he was waiting. He had to have asked me a question and I had missed it. I shrugged at him, hoping that would satisfy his question and we could move on.</p><p>He leaned in very close, I was taken aback but I never budged. His hot breath tickled my lips. I gulped, knowing what was about to happen.</p> <p>He never closed his eyes, even though he was an inch from my face. My eyes went blurry, as he got close; I could imagine the taste of his mouth. He smelled like Heaven. It was the smell of fresh air mixed with something I couldn\u2019t place. I wanted to fight my body and my urges and pull away from him, but I was a snake caught in the music of his pungi. He had charmed every inch of me\u2014inches I didn\u2019t know existed.</p><p>After a very long moment, he moved in the last inch and his lips brushed mine. It was so soft, I couldn\u2019t stand the torture. I leaned in, but he seemed to pull back, keeping our touch light. His soft lips brushed mine, caressing them like a lover. His tongue slowly grazed my lips, sending a shiver up my spine and then down again. I didn\u2019t know what was happening, but the control I worked everyday to maintain was gone. I wasn\u2019t in charge. I had no sarcasm for the moment; it was raw emotion. I understood ragged breath, as mine had become inconsistent. I didn\u2019t need air; I needed his kiss to deepen and relieve me of the build of tension.</p><p>He pulled away though, leaving me hanging there.</p><p>I watched him smile, like a light had switched on. I felt my face curl into a frown, and I wanted to cry. I understood crack addicts\u2019 need for their addiction. I needed his skin to touch mine again. I wanted him to crash onto my face, crushing me with a powerful kiss, but instead he started talking.</p><p>\u201cAimee, I'm cursed.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t care. Bad luck had rained down on me for so long, it didn\u2019t matter if he brought more into the relationship. To be completely honest, it was probably me that made him feel cursed.</p><p>He continued softly, \u201cI am like an angel of tragedy and accident.\u201d His words never made their way to my brain. They stopped at my ears. I could hear him talking, but I couldn\u2019t comprehend, as I was still in a cloud of wanton lust.</p><p>He grabbed my bare shoulders and gave me a slight shake. \u201cAimee, I am an immortal. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, watching his lips move. My brain was freaking out. I could hear the thoughts panicking in there, but no one responded to their demands.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again.</p> <p>He stood up, taking the sudden warmth away from me. I began to shiver, as all of the light inside of me went to the other side of the room with him. It was still attached to him.</p><p>He stood there by my door and held his hands out. He smirked at me one second, and in another, he was across the room. It was not a big room, but I didn\u2019t even see him take a step.</p><p>He knelt at my bed again and smiled. \u201cI am not like you,\u201d his voice was a whisper.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say. He had lied to me about so many things. I didn\u2019t understand why he had to go to such extreme places to make up stories. Not when the plain truth was there in front of me. He was a conman. I was cool with it.</p><p>\"I don't know how to be with you, but I can't seem to be without you.\"</p><p>The disappointment and severity of the feelings I was having was too much to take. I felt angry hatred filling me, no doubt from the physical reaction I had to him every time I saw him. I lashed out at him, hitting whatever I could make contact with. I hated him. I had such ardent feelings for him and I didn\u2019t even recognize what they were. I was able to go from love and adoration to despicable hatred in between the beats of my heart.</p><p>As I clawed out at him in my fit of rage and screams, I felt the wet, hot tears pouring down my cheeks. He pulled me into him to muffle the screams and picked me up. I tried to fight him, but his face had grown stone hard and stern looking. He looked at my open window, and before I could properly talk him out of a murder suicide, he jumped.</p><p>I saw the ground in a flash and then I didn\u2019t see anything. My grip on him was hurting my hands and I felt like I would throw up any second. We moved so quickly, I couldn\u2019t see anything. The motion was too much for me to bear. I closed my eyes, screaming into his laughing chest. I couldn\u2019t believe he would laugh at this moment.</p> <p>I felt a hard bump and then I felt myself being lowered to the soft sand. Lastly, as the fear and terror started to subside, I heard the ocean. I looked around me. I was at the hidden beach. I knew it instantly because it was a sandy beach. On the Northwest Coast, we did anything we had to in order to find one. It was the only one I knew of.</p><p>It had taken seconds for us to get there. Or had it? Had I blacked out? I knew it was a forty-minute hike through the roughest terrain from the side of the highway on the outskirts of town. Had he hiked with me in his arms? Had we driven? Had he drugged me again?</p><p>The night air was cold against my panties and tank top. The cold sand sat firmly beneath me, but I still had to touch it to be certain I was really there. A million thoughts flashed through my head, mostly they were warnings.</p><p>I looked at Aleks, who stood with his arms crossed, watching me silently.</p><p>He stepped one small step closer. Before I could even decide if it was what I wanted to do or not, I jumped up and started to run from him. My bare toes hit the sand and dug in as I screamed, \u201cSomeone help me. Please someone help me. It's Aimee James. Please help me.\u201d</p><p>Aleks was in front of me somehow, like he was toying with me. I ran back the other way but again he was in front of me, somehow. Defeated, I dropped to my knees and started to cry.</p><p>He walked to me slowly with his hands out, as if he were approaching a crazed person with a gun.</p><p>I wished for a second I had a gun, but I wasn\u2019t entirely sure whom I would shoot, him or me. My body shook with sobs.</p><p>He dropped to his knees in the sand. His hand reached out to my face and lifted my chin slowly. \u201cAimee, I told you this once before\u2014I could never hurt you. I am here for you.\u201d</p><p>I cried harder. \u201cOh my God. It's like City of Angels. I\u2019m dying. You\u2019re here to take me to Heaven, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his huge, blue sweater off and put it over my head. I pulled away from his grasp, but I was dressed in it before I could argue. The warmth of the sweater was relaxing.</p><p>He put his arms around me and pulled me into his bare chest. \u201cYou\u2019re not dying. I\u2019m here because you\u2019re not coping. You and your family, in a way, called to me when your mom died in the accident.\u201d</p><p>I sobbed; I couldn\u2019t control myself. I understood what he was saying, but it contradicted everything I knew in life to be true. Well, except for the fact we weren\u2019t coping. That part was true.</p><p>\u201cI lied to you about being a social worker, because I couldn\u2019t tell you what I was. In my defense though, you should never have seen me. Your mom\u2019s death has triggered a series of events that never should have happened. It wasn\u2019t her time. Just like the night you choked and I saved you, it wasn\u2019t your time. I was called to stay with your family, making you feel safe, and ensure nothing happened that had been caused by her death.\u201d He held me tightly, not giving me an inch of space to struggle or flee while he told me a fairytale.</p><p>\u201cI got to you too late that night. You saw me because you were a spirit. That changes the whole thing. Once you see an immortal, it gets easier. Shane\u2019s bloody yard was not making it easy on me, either. That shaman's blessing makes it impossible for my kind to cloak properly. I was at the party, but when you saw me watching you, I left to stay with your dad. I felt you cross into the otherworld, and I got there as fast as I could.\u201d</p><p>I had stopped crying and started to laugh uncontrollably. He pulled me away and gave me an alarmed stare. It made me laugh harder; I couldn\u2019t stop myself. My right ribs hurt so much where my liver was, but even the pain couldn\u2019t make the laugh stop. I fell over into the sand, rolling as I laughed.</p><p>He started to smile and laugh at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost it\u2014haven\u2019t you? This was the straw that broke the camel's back, and I\u2019ve pushed you over the edge to insanity.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to cope with anything he told me and laughing was making me feel better.</p><p>Tears rolled down my face as finally I was able to get a hold of myself. \u201cThe stupid shaman story was true?\u201d</p><p>Of all the things in his story he told me, that just seemed too ridiculous.</p><p>He nodded, smirking at me. \u201cShamans are very powerful, Aimee. A being nearly as powerful and equally supernatural caused your mom\u2019s death. Nothing in the world will ever be the same for you. You\u2019ve seen the other side, which means you\u2019re stuck now with visions from the in-between.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t happened, except for seeing you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou could see past my cloak, Aimee. That\u2019s a bad sign.\u201d</p><p>He shuffled forward on his knees to me, getting sand all over his jeans. I looked at him, trying desperately to see something other than what I saw. The sexiest man I could even imagine, crawling on the sand toward me in jeans that hugged him nicely and no shirt. His stomach flexed under his silky skin. I wanted to touch each ab muscle. I wanted to run my hands down his stomach, possibly dragging my fingernails a little.</p><p>I shook my head. \"You're a hallucination brought on by the drugs and the stress of yesterday.\"</p><p>\"You saw me before you were drugged.\" he grinned.</p><p>I blushed looking at his lips, trying desperately to remember that the man had weird powers. My brain argued that even with the creepy things, he was sexy. I sighed, giving up, and resigned myself to the fact I was a dirty-freak, flag-waving pervert.</p><p>His smile reassured me. Even though my whole world filled with questions, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted the answers to them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rubbed along my arms, trying to warm me up, while looking down on me as we knelt on the sand.</p><p>The moon, no doubt under his spell, drifted out from the cloud it had concealed itself behind. It shone down on us, making it easier to see his face. He looked to be wrestling with the idea of kissing me.</p><p>As if he decided not to give it another thought, he lowered his face to mine. The kiss was passionate, rough and harsh. His teeth bit down on my lower lip, sucking it in his mouth before kissing me once more.</p> <p>I felt like a cat that had been stroked too much. I was over stimulated. I felt the swell in my lips worsen as our arms began savagely grabbing at one another.</p><p>He pulled me up into him. His hands crept down my back to where his sweater ended and my legs sat bare. My arms were around his back, rubbing his hot, smooth skin. I tried desperately to keep my hands \u2018north of the equator.\u2019</p><p>He lifted me up into his arms. I wrapped my legs around him. He lifted me with ease, his strength seemingly unrealistic. I felt like my sister; out on the beach making out under the moonlight, with a guy people suspected of a terrible crime. I pushed myself away, needing breath and separation.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><p>He smiled breathlessly at me. \u201cI need a minute before I can get back.\u201d</p> <p>I put my foot down on the sand and stood on shaky legs. My headache seemed to be coming back. I couldn\u2019t believe how long it was taking me to bounce back. He watched me like a predator watches a fawn, his eyes moving up and down my bare legs. I felt safe with him against everything, except him. And me. Out there I wasn\u2019t afraid of the date rapist, bears, wolves, or cougars, but I was afraid of me. I was afraid of losing control of myself and doing something based entirely on my emotional body, and not on common sense or rational thought. That was not a comfortable thing for me.</p><p>He stood up after a minute and held his arms out. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cCan we walk?\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward and picked me up, and before I had a chance to argue my opinion on the matter, we were gone.</p><p>He looked hurt as he pulled us through the air and everything sped past me in a sickening blur. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\u2014you don\u2019t trust me? I've really slowed the flash down for you. We're barely moving.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt's not that. I just don\u2019t like not being in control.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, not watching where he was going, making me nervous. \u201cI think the only thing saving both of us from making a huge mistake tonight is your control, because I\u2019ve lost all of mine.\u201d His eyes glistened dangerously as he bent down and kissed me.</p><p>I panicked. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going!\u201d</p><p>\"We're in your room, Aimee.\"</p><p>The next thing I felt was the softness of my sheets. Wide eyed, I frowned at him. \u201cI have sand on my butt\u2014I don\u2019t want it in my sheets.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and sat on the chair across the room, watching me. I was embarrassed to be seen changing. Regardless of the fact, he had already seen me showering, which disturbed me enough. I gave him a look and walked to the bathroom with new pajamas. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t right back. I stayed in the shower trying to translate all of the details he told me into layman\u2019s terms, as if I were telling my sister.</p><p>\u201cHe is an immortal who was trying to help us cope with mom's accident. He was trying to make sure a negative outcome didn\u2019t happen as a result of Mom's death, which was not meant to be. A supernatural force or being killed Mom, and as a result, everything in our lives is upside down. I accidentally died on his watch and he managed to save me. As a result, I can see him and dead people, even though that is unfounded at this point. He is attracted to me and I him, even though he isn\u2019t a human being.\u201d I summed it up out loud to get a good grasp on how things were. I turned off the shower and knew what I had to do.</p><p>\"I have lost my mind; he isn\u2019t real, and the hallucinations have finally taken over.\" That seemed more plausible in my mind.</p> <p>I dressed quickly and went downstairs, ignoring the pain in my head, to see my dad, so he wouldn\u2019t worry. \u201cHey, Dad. I\u2019m going back to bed. I just showered.\u201d</p><p>He was reading a text of some sort and looked up with his glasses on, smiling. \u201cFeeling better?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, lying. \u201cYeah, I think I just needed some sleep. I should be better by tomorrow, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, kiddo. Night.\u201d</p><p>As I turned to climb the stairs, a knock at the door caught my attention. My dad glanced at me. I nodded. \"I'll get it.\" The trek across the room to the door was brutal. My hands quivered from the pain.</p><p>My stomach sunk when I opened the door. Shane smirked at me and stepped inside. \"Hey. Just wanted to check on you.\"</p><p>He bent his face and pressed his lips against mine. I breathed him in and moaned slightly.</p><p>He grinned against my lips. \"You okay?\" I was clearly not okay. I was turned on.</p><p>I blushed and pulled back. \"Yeah. Just sleepy.\"</p><p>He tucked my long hair behind my ear and played with the long end. The proximity of his huge hand and my breast was too much. I almost leaned in and made him have a boob graze. I wanted his hands on me. I wanted him. I stood up on my tiptoes and ran my fingers up into his thick hair, pulling his face back down on mine. He lifted me and pulled me back out of the house. Away from the watchful eyes of my father.</p><p>He lifted me up, pulling me into him. I moaned into the kiss, caressing him with my hands and mouth. He pulled back chuckling. \"Aimes, what's gotten into you?\" I wanted to tell him a tall blond hallucination, but I shook my head and wiped my swollen lips.</p><p>\"So, we're good?\" He grinned.</p><p>\"Yeah. Call you tomorrow?\" I took a step back, resting my fleecy back against the door.</p><p>He stepped into me and devoured me once more. His body was crushing me into the dark door. He pushed himself away, turned, and waved backwards.</p><p>He started the truck and drove off like a madman. My fingers dug into the door, trying to grip the hard surface. He was the right fit for my heart. He always had been. I turned and went back inside, feeling sick about Aleks and Shane and the whole mess.</p><p>My dad grinned with his glasses and glass of wine, pretending to read the textbook he held. I rolled my eyes. \"Night.\"</p><p>\"Uh huh.\"</p><p>I was just grateful my sister wasn\u2019t home to witness my whorish ways. If I had to guess, I would assume she was at Blake\u2019s house.</p><p>I climbed the stairs, trying to make it all the way to the top so my dad wouldn\u2019t doubt my miraculous recovery. In truth, the stairs were death. My poor legs shook as I made it up all the way. Being around Aleks seemed to be the only thing that made me feel good.</p><p>That worried me. Almost as much as walking into my room and having to look in his eyes.</p><p>I opened my bedroom door to find him lying on my bed reading a book on how to decipher Arabic.</p><p>He was in his jeans, still half naked on my bed. I frowned at his jeans, imagining all of the salt and sand that would be covering my sheets, adding to what I had already left there.</p><p>He smiled as I closed my door and locked it. \u201cI took the sheets and my pants outside and shook them; there isn\u2019t any sand.\u201d</p><p>\"Thanks.\" I wondered if he could read my mind, or if, because he was a figment of my mind, he knew what I was thinking.</p><p>His crooked smile seemed to be stuck on his face. His piercing blue eyes were driving me crazy.</p><p>I walked near him. He grabbed my hand and pulled me on top of him. He rubbed my back. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen these kind of pajamas on a girl your age in a long time.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, raising one eyebrow, \u201cFleece?\u201d I could still taste Shane. I felt bad and yet still turned on. I was becoming a hot mess.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah, girls your age wear sexy things.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh back. \u201cWell, I had panties and a tank top on, but you wrecked them. Honestly, I just can\u2019t seem to shake feeling cold and itchy. These make me feel nice.\u201d</p><p>He agreed. \u201cI love fleece; it makes me want to rub you.\u201d His strong hands rubbing up and down my spine did feel very nice. I could have fallen asleep, if I wasn\u2019t in the mood to rip his clothes off and have him deflower me right there.</p><p>The sexy vibe started to fade away as his massage deepened. It relaxed me and made me sleepy. My head didn\u2019t hurt while he was touching me. I felt peaceful. I knew I had to follow the plan though if I was ever going to get beyond the schizophrenia fears I was harboring.</p><p>I rolled off of him to the side of my bed. It didn\u2019t seem to deter him from kissing my neck and rubbing the outer thigh of my PJ's.</p><p>Feeling the lust coming back, I pushed him away. \u201cGo to the chair. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cWe can talk here. I\u2019ll behave.\u201d He kissed my cheek once, pausing, as he inhaled the fresh scent of my soap no doubt. I turned my face and felt his lips brush mine, sensually again, like the first kiss. I fell into the kiss again, finding myself chasing him. Trying to get him to pull into me and smother me with his affections. I inhaled his scent, feeling my skin tingle and eyes roll back into my head.</p><p>Somehow, and I\u2019m honestly not sure how, I managed to pull myself away. \u201cGo to the chair. You\u2019re not behaving and I know I can't.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me through his crazy-long dark lashes and smiled an innocent look. \"I can try harder.\"</p><p>I groaned and pushed him off the bed with all the strength I had.</p><p>He landed on his feet with amazing reflexes and grabbed the chair from the other side of the room. He pulled it over to beside my bed. He sat on it backwards, waiting.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready, brainiac\u2014fire away.\u201d He kept a smirk on his face, probably already knowing the questions I had to ask.</p><p>I lay on my back. \u201cOkay, so we are going to do the Q&amp;A portion of this evening, quickly. I have about ten minutes of effort left in me and need some sleep. Ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your worst.\u201d</p><p>\"Did the drugs ruin my brain?\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"Do I have drug-induced schizophrenia? Are you a figment of my imagination?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You have sand on your floor from the beach, and I healed your pain. The answer is obviously not scientific. Next.\"</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix hundred and forty-three.\u201d He responded quickly and efficiently. I liked that.</p> <p>\u201cHow many families like mine have you worked with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many. It doesn\u2019t happen often. I\u2019ve never kept track, but I would say a few hundred at the most?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you live in your off time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just roam until I\u2019m called.

I\u2019ve been cursed to be what I am since my death. I, like you, have heard there is a Heaven. I have met people who have been there. I, myself, have never.\u201d</p><p>\"Were you ever a human?\u201d I turned to face him.</p><p>He flinched, ever so slightly, at the question. \u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t go into any other detail, but I could see the rigidity wash over him.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>His look told me to drop it. \u201cSix hundred and twenty years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-three?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>I felt my eyes get heavy as my head started to hurt again. \u201cDid you see my mom die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I came afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat killed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shape shifter.\u201d His voice never cracked or wavered as he said it.</p><p>My head instantly translated as I felt myself drift off into a painful sleep. A werewolf or something that belonged on an HBO show killed my mom.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Is there Philly cream cheese in Heaven?</p> <p>I dreamed things that made no sense to me. I felt lost and confused. My mom was falling and then she turned into an angel and flew back up into the sky. She never came back down from the sky. She also didn\u2019t seem too concerned that I was standing on the road watching her fly away. She didn\u2019t wave to me.</p><p>I woke to find Aleks sleeping beside me on my bed, his warm body nearly burning me as I touched him. I still felt frozen but touching him seemed to take it away.</p><p>A million questions were stuck in my mind. They had nowhere to go. My head was swelling with them.</p><p>Aleks stirred, turning on his side and wrapped his leg around me. He pulled me into him. I let his lips drag up my throat. I giggled until he whispered a word, \u201cNora.\u201d</p><p>I froze, not sure what to think. I stayed very still, until he started to wake up and opened his eyes to me. I assumed Nora must have been a woman he loved before he met me. The immature side of me seeped out into my mind and started making a mountain out of the molehill. I tried to fight against it, but it made sense to me. I reminded myself about Shane, and then the jealousy fizzled out.</p><p>He looked at me, confused, watching the wheels turning. He smiled. \u201cYou have more questions now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Nora?\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>He winced in pain at the sound of the name. He pulled away from me, not sure what to do with the question. Finally, after a moment of thought he whispered, \u201cMy wife.\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped and I felt a shiver tremble through my whole body. \u201cWife,\u201d I stated it matter-of-factly.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes. We were married when I was eighteen. She was the only woman I ever loved in my whole life, until now.\u201d His eyes screamed a pain, where his lips tried to calm with a soothing smile.</p><p>I was awash with sadness, even though the greatest moment of my life had just happened. He told me he loved me. \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at the sheets, breaking the eye contact, as if ashamed. \u201cShe remarried and moved on after I died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you watch her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cEvery day I could. I watched her fall out of love with me and in love with him. The sweet soft girl I had married became a hardened woman. It was a tough time and she had a hard go.\u201d</p><p>I blinked away a tear. \u201cYou still love her.\u201d It was a statement not a question.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. She was my first true love, and I never got closure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you from?\u201d I asked, kissing the tip of his nose. I could see him putting up a wall, like I did. I backed off a little.</p><p>He smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019m from Norway. Aurland; it's on the N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord. My family had a farm. My surname was Jonson because my dad's name was Jon\u2014that\u2019s how it was done. So my sisters were Jonsdoter. Our mom was captured from somewhere near the Greek islands in a raid. So she named me Aleksander. It was a Greek name but it sounded Norwegian. Well, it did to her. I was made fun of a lot for my name. Everyone thought it was a girl's name. Education wasn\u2019t as important back then. Not like it is now, where everyone knows about Aleksander the great.\u201d He beamed at me.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cSo, can you still speak Norwegian?\u201d I asked, not thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cJa jeg kan.\u201d He smiled, laughing. \u201cSo, shall we get to the rest of your questions? I know you have million.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your wife\u2014that\u2019s really sad. What did she look like?\u201d</p><p>His eyes slanted. \u201cNot letting this one go, huh? Fine. She was tall, very tall. Almost as tall as I am. She had long, blonde hair to her waist; it was thick and almost white. Like yours, but thicker. Her skin tanned, even though she was fair. Her eyes were blue like mine\u2014very intensely blue. She had a pretty face with beautiful features. She was thick, not fat, but strong. She could pull a cart and carry kids around all day. She was an amazing woman. Are you happy you know that now? Shall we talk about your past boyfriends?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip. \u201cI don\u2019t have any past anyone\u2019s. I had never been kissed in my life, before these last few weeks.\u201d</p><p>His face grew reddened and angry looking. \u201cThe guy who was here last night, making out with you on the front porch? He doesn\u2019t count?\u201d</p><p>I nodded frowning at him. \u201cYeah, but you're still a criminal to society and before you were always vanishing on me. I thought you were a ghost for a while. Kissing Shane still seems like a better idea than kissing you.\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment.\u201d</p><p>I blushed, sensing his annoyance on the subject. \u201cI know I have to end things with Shane; this is what I want...me and you.\u201d I smirked at him. The statement felt true, except for the small niggling twinge in my belly that hurt when I thought about breaking things off with Shane.</p><p>He tilted his head. \"You know, I haven\u2019t felt this protective and possessive in a long time. It\u2019s going to take me a while to learn to control my emotions.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at the ceiling as I thought for a minute on how to ask the question I had been wondering about from the moment he started this conversation. \u201cHow did you die and become an immortal?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThere it is\u2014the right question.\u201d He ran his right hand through his short hair and looked down at the bed. His eyelids lifted without moving his head and he watched me through his lashes again. \u201cSame as your mom. A shape shifter killed me. I was attacked and left in the woods to die. Next question\u2014\u201d He shut it down before it could start.</p><p>I interrupted. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t turn into a werewolf from the bite?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHollywood made that up in the thirties with The Wolfman. No, a man must be cursed by a special and rare person to become a lycanthrope. The bite does nothing but infect the person if the wound is not taken care of. Rarely is a person bitten though. Most of them hunt animals in the forests, not people. We don\u2019t taste very good. True shifters are Fae.\u201d His smile was haunted.</p><p>I felt my brow knit together. \"Fae?\"</p><p>\"A discussion for another time.\"</p><p>\u201cBut how did you become this? How did you learn all your magical powers?\u201d I could see him backing away emotionally from the conversation.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on right now. We have a problem. I don\u2019t know how to stop my curse from pulling me to the next place.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and got the message loud and clear. I tried to think about questions I had that weren\u2019t part of the things he wouldn\u2019t want to talk about, his wife, his family, his home land, his turning into whatever he was, and definitely no discussing his death. That left me with very little.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know to come here when my mom died? How do you know where to go next?\u201d I hoped he would at least answer this, and I could possibly hypothesize on my own from the breadcrumbs he left me.</p><p>\u201cI just know; I get a feeling. Like when you have a dream, I see what happens in flashes or pieces, I guess. I just know that I need to go right or left.\u201d</p><p>I felt disappointment rolling over me in waves. Asking him questions was making my head want to explode.</p><p>\u201cI kind of saw it more as you fly up to the pearly gates and someone gives you a clipboard with a name on it. You then ask questions around the Philly cream cheese snack bar and figure out how you\u2019re going to crack this tough case.\u201d</p><p>He burst into laughter. \u201cOh God, I wish it was that easy. I\u2019m not a real angel. I\u2019m cursed.\u201d He moved a strand of hair from my face and smiled. \u201cI think you should go and eat.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling frustrated.</p><p>I felt a little dizzy again but I knew now to wait it out. The stars always cleared after a moment or so. Aleks stood holding a hand out for me to take.</p><p>I reached for it, letting him pull me off the bed. My legs wanted to buckle. I could tell from his worried expression that he was thinking about taking me back to the hospital. I knew all I needed was more sleep, so I stood my ground and walked out of my room. My dad wasn\u2019t downstairs.</p><p>\u201cDo you get hungry?\u201d I asked as I walked slowly down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYes and no. I am an immortal now. I\u2019m not like an angel in that I can make myself vanish and become air. I have a sort of magic now. I can cloak myself around people who haven\u2019t been to the in-between obviously. Even cloaked, you\u2019ve seen me, so you\u2019re not a normal person anymore. I need food and drink to live, but I won\u2019t die without it. I will get tired and weak after a long time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walked into the kitchen and grabbed a frying pan. \u201cLike omelets?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and sat at the bar.</p><p>\u201cSo, you are a flesh and blood human with a beating heart?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, not answering. I could see I was wearing on his last nerve and stopped asking questions. I was stewing on safe questions while I beat the eggs and chopped the vegetables.</p><p>\u201cAre vampires real?\u201d It only made sense to me that if the wolves were real, so were the vamps.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer but when I looked at him, I got my answer. His face was grim.</p><p>\u201cAre you a vampire?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He had said he was an immortal. Maybe he was a nice vampire.</p> <p>Again he didn\u2019t look amused. \u201cNo, for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019m sorry I said you could ask questions. You\u2019re the most inquisitive person alive. I am not a vampire. Yes, they\u2019re real. I think that in your world, you will find things have changed now that your second sight has\u2014\u201d</p><p>I interrupted, \u201cSecond sight?\u201d</p><p>He nodded impatiently and pinched the bridge of his nose for a moment. \u201cYour ability to see me will make other things easier to see as well.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop my brain now. \u201cDo vampires become vampires from a bite?\u201d</p><p>He slumped at the bar and groaned. \u201cNo, Hollywood is not the place to look for facts. Like lycanthropes, vampires have to be turned a special way. If a vampire bit you, he would drink your blood and heal your wounds before you would even realize it had happened. They\u2019re very charming.\u201d He almost growled at me as I passed him the plate of toast and omelets.</p><p>I sat beside him at the bar with my orange juice and steaming plate of food and blinked. \u201cSo, they drink blood?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded blowing on his fork full of eggs. \u201cYeah, unfortunately they do. They aren\u2019t all bad, but they need human blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould they drink yours?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThis is the last question for a while, okay? No, they cannot. I am an immortal; my blood would mean death or sickness, depending on how old the vampire was. Me and Angels. They can\u2019t eat either of us. Yes, Angels are bloody real and no, I don\u2019t want to discuss it further.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, eating my eggs. I was stuck in all the empty knowledge that led nowhere and the millions of questions I couldn\u2019t ask.</p><p>I turned and watched him eat. I distracted myself with his jaw flexing and his juicy lips.</p><p>He frowned at me with a mouth full of hot eggs and peppers, as he tried to suck in cold air and talk. \u201cEat. You\u2019re weak and watching me eat isn\u2019t gong to make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>I took a bite of the eggs on my fork and chewed, barely tasting the food. My stomach seemed to turn at the thought of food. I ate to make him happy and tried to seem like I could move on. But I didn\u2019t. My mind was brewing.</p><p>Having nothing to say and sitting in silence proved to be quite a challenge. I waited for him to talk about anything he wanted to talk about. He seemed content in the silence, which was really annoying. We finished breakfast and I started cleaning up the dishes, and I realized I had a whole line of questioning I hadn\u2019t even touched on.</p> <p>He saw the gleam in my eye and moaned. I ignored him and moved in for the kill. \u201cDo you know who the rapist is?\u201d</p><p>He sat perfectly still and then nodded slowly, not making any noise.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou have to tell the police.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \"I can't.\"</p><p>I leaned against the kitchen counter. \u201cAre you telling me that you know who is raping and attacking girls, including me, who you say you love, but you won't tell me or the authorities who he is?\u201d</p><p>He nodded still sitting tight-lipped. \"What kind of proof do I have beyond seeing him running through the woods? What kind of witness am I? I have no I.D.; I have no address. I do not belong in your world, and the secret of mine is far more important than the safety of a small town. I'm sorry. It isn\u2019t just my secret to share.\"</p><p>I pointed to the door. \u201cNo, you need to go now and tell the police.\"</p><p>\"I can't get involved. I'm sorry. I have other things and people to protect.\"</p><p>\"That could have been me. I could have been face down in the dirty grass with my skirt around my waist.\"</p><p>He didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\"Are you heartless?\"</p><p>His face remained stern and unfeeling.</p><p>\"Get out of my house. I\u2019m fine. Protect my sister and dad from bad karma, but leave me alone. I don\u2019t believe in karma, anyway. I don\u2019t even believe in you.\u201d</p><p>He stood and looked at me. His eyes were full of regret as he turned and walked out of my house. I cried. I went back to bed and slept some more.</p><p>I woke hearing rustling in my room, assuming it was him I shouted, \u201cGet out. Pervert.\u201d</p><p>My sister peeked her dark head of hair up at me out of my closet. \u201cYeah, like our parts don\u2019t match? Whatevs. I need that shoe you wore the other night. I found one, but where is the other one?\u201d I looked around the room, seeing the mess everywhere. My room had slowly become like my sister's. It exhausted me to think about the mess around me, even though I had slept for days. I sat up feeling the best I had in a while and gave my sister a look. \u201cWhy can't you just wear one of the millions of other pairs?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou okay, Aimes? Normally I really wouldn\u2019t care, but you\u2019ve been in bed for five days again.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re sleeping a lot. The doctor came four days ago and checked your vitals out when you were sleeping. He said as long as your eyes and skin aren\u2019t turning yellow, you would be fine. He said you\u2019re just recovering which can take a couple months. I don\u2019t know though, dude. You seem like you're dying.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the floor to see a cup I didn\u2019t recognize and a few dishes.</p><p>\u201cHave I been eating up here?\u201d Vague memories of my father spoon-feeding me filled my hazy mind.</p><p>She nodded, sitting on my bed, looking confused. \u201cYeah, Dad\u2019s been bringing you dinner and feeding you. Dude, you don\u2019t remember any of this? Yikes. He called the doctor again today and the doctor wants you to come back for a check up on Monday. He said it's normal after what you\u2019ve been through to feel sick like this. He said it could be another month. But we're getting worried.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t recognize this person on my bed. Her steely-silver eyes glistened as she spoke, \u201cJaime is awake now. She said she doesn\u2019t remember anything, but the doctors confirmed she was raped. He never got to finish because you and that guy came. You saved her, Aimes.\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyes light up. \u201cShe\u2019s awake? So, she\u2019ll be okay?\u201d</p><p>Alise nodded. \u201cYeah, I guess she didn\u2019t have an allergy like Giselle. Speaking of Giselle\u2014your phone\u2019s been going nuts, dude. It\u2019s been like fifty messages a day and Shane\u2019s called about twenty times a day. He\u2019s really worried. Dad won't let him in your room, so when he shows up, he stays at the door and then leaves after a while. Kind of awkward for me. A few times he stayed and watched Discovery with Dad. I think he was hoping you\u2019d wake up and he could see you one time.\u201d</p><p>I put a hand to my face. \u201cOh my God\u2014I\u2019m like a mono victim. I need to get out of bed and go see Giselle and Shane.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, deciding to forgive and accept. \u201cHow\u2019s Blake?\u201d</p><p>Her smile became so deep it hit her eyes, making them sparkly like platinum. \u201cHe\u2019s the weirdest guy I\u2019ve ever met. I hate the way he just sits and reads sometimes for like hours. He is like you, but a dude. He wears all these shirts that make no sense, and I bought him this super expensive watch with his money, and he hates it. God, he keeps wearing that nerdy N.S.A one. And he never tells me I\u2019m beautiful or wants to, you know\u2014do it. I think he\u2019s never done it before, which is cool with me. He seems happy to just lie on his bed and read beside me. I\u2019m so tired of him, but I can\u2019t stop going over there.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOh my God. You like him. It\u2019s N.A.S.A. by the way; it\u2019s the spaceship people. Not N.S.A. This is you gushing, sis. I\u2019m glad, but please go easy on him. I know it's not your nature, but try. He was my best friend.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI can't help but go easy on him. He won't fight with me. He just sits there. I accused him of flirting with Jessica at a hot-tub party we had at his house on Sunday. He sat on the couch, watching some special on how they\u2019re making the astronauts retire and work in tourism. I yelled at him and he cut me off mid screaming fit and said, \u201cHey babe, can you get me a drink of water?\u201d She changed her voice to mimic a man's for the question.</p><p>I smiled, knowing the exact face he would have used. \u201cGuess you\u2019ve met your match.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m scared though. What if I mess it up?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHe won't let you. He doesn\u2019t buy into your drama.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand down on my arm and rubbed a little like Mom used to. \u201cAimes, can you try to get better? I know you\u2019re sad about something, but can you just try a little harder? I can't take this. Giselle is dying, Jaime is sick like you, and you\u2019re scaring us with all this sleeping.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, gulping back a tear lodged in my throat. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m going to take a shower and get dressed now. Have the police got any idea what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>She got up from my bed and shook her head. \u201cNo, they\u2019re still kind of lost. I guess they found the cup she was drinking from though, so that\u2019s good. They know what the drugs are that the rapist is using.\u201d</p><p>I got up from my bed slowly. \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cFriday. The big dance is tonight. I think Shane's worried you won't be able to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go. I need to go to Giselle\u2019s to get my dress, though. She wants me to wear her spring formal dress.\u201d I felt weird about it.</p><p>My sister\u2019s face lit up again. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go? I\u2019ll drive you over when you\u2019re done showering.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked over at my open window and felt lost. Aleks hadn\u2019t been back. I reminded myself I didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t want him back.</p><p>The shower was relaxing on my aching back. I hadn\u2019t done anything in nearly a week, which seemed to be killing me. I decided, even if I was dead-assed exhausted, I wasn\u2019t going to bed until it was actual bedtime.</p><p>I felt so many emotions all at once that my poor little wall had been crumbled and ground into dust. I didn\u2019t know what to do about Shane; he was the perfect guy for me. More though, I didn\u2019t know what to do about Aleks. He was all wrong for me, but for some crazy hormonal and chemical reaction-based reason, my heart seemed to need him.</p> <p>I pictured his face and I melted. I remembered our kissing and touching. Even though he had never crossed the second-base line, I felt naughty. Everything about him turned me into a person I didn\u2019t know. Everything about Shane made me feel safe and relaxed\u2014more like the girl I was before everything had happened. I just needed to decide if I wanted to change or be who I was.</p><p>I put my face into the shower and turned the water to cold, hoping the shock would be helpful. I had never been in real reciprocated love before, and of course, my first romance had to be a love triangle. And not just any old triangle\u2014no, it had to have a supernatural being as the one I wanted, instead of the guy I\u2019d always thought I'd loved.</p><p>My brain still treated him as a joke. I couldn\u2019t help thinking about the fact that my dad had been feeding me all week long, and that I didn\u2019t remember much. Perhaps, my memories of Aleks were also not correct.</p><p>Not feeling any more convinced of anything beyond my absolute love for him, I climbed out of the shower, angry with myself.</p><p>For all my grades and common sense, I clearly hadn\u2019t gotten any taste in men. I decided maybe I could force myself to relearn to love the person that was right for me, instead of obsessing about the person who wasn\u2019t even real.</p> <p>I walked into my room to dry off to find Aleks sitting on my bed. I was naked, except for my towel, which only covered the essentials. I wanted to jump on him and kiss him, but I stood my ground at the entrance to my room and leaned against the doorframe.</p><p>He sat there quiet for a while, staring at the stuffed bear he was holding. It was my bear, Beary, from when I had my tonsils out when I was nine. He squished him, feeling the density of the fluff.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He smiled devilishly, not taking his eyes off Beary. \u201cWatching over your sister.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at him. \"You\u2019re cheating. I can\u2019t get over you if you don\u2019t leave me alone. Stop touching Beary; he doesn\u2019t like you either.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me with his intense blue eyes through his long black lashes. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get over me.\u201d</p> <p>I felt like I needed to back up, but his stare locked me in and was pulling me to him. If he stood up, I would scream, I told myself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bad for me. You\u2019re going to leave in a few weeks if that. Once the pervert is caught, you won\u2019t need to hang around and that feeling is going to come back. You\u2019ll need to move on to the next people.\u201d I spoke the words fine, but to my heart they were hollow.</p><p>He nodded, still smiling dangerously at me. \u201cI know. It\u2019s a predicament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get ready, I need to go to Giselle\u2019s and get her dress for the dance tonight. Plus I need to go see Jaime. She\u2019s awake\u2014no thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>I remembered how angry I was with him. \u2018Just keep chanting Jaime\u2019 I told myself.</p><p>He stood up looking deeply into my eyes, as he seemed to fill the entire space of my room. \u201cYou\u2019re going to the dance?\u201d His tone was not something I had heard before. It was dangerous.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWith Shane?\u201d</p> <p>I chose not to answer.</p><p>He crossed the room in a step and looked down on me. \u201cThis is what you want?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again, not able to speak, seeing his lips so close to mine. His scent filled the air around me making me frown, not at him but against my feelings for him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think it's what you want. I know it\u2019s not what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go with you.\u201d The words were so much bigger than the dance; they were everything. No matter what he did from then on, I couldn\u2019t go with him.</p><p>I gripped my towel and walked past him and sat on my bed. He closed my door and came to where I was sitting. He knelt in front of me and took my left hand in his. It looked tiny and thin compared to his huge hands. \u201cAimee.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my hand once and spoke, \u201cI am in love with you.\u201d He kissed it twice and then turned it over and kissed my palm. He was driving my body crazy and my brain started to get foggy again. I couldn\u2019t think around him; I seemed to only feel.</p><p>I pulled my hand away and swallowed hard. \u201cI want to go to the dance. I want a normal boyfriend who isn\u2019t going to abandon me. I want something in my life to be regular again.\u201d I paused for a second, knowing that if I finished my thought, he would be hurt. As much as I knew I needed him to go away, I also knew it was going to crush my soul to make him go. I closed my eyes and let my mouth say the words. \u201cI want a boyfriend who will answer my questions, not make more.\u201d I opened my eyes, terrified of his reaction.</p><p>His left eye twitched, as if his face would have flinched, but he fought it off.</p><p>He leaned into me and it was as if his body grew in size. Somehow he took up all the light in the room. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, mine.\u201d His words were spoken softly but the meaning was clear. His love scared me. I understood what my sister meant when she said that she was scared of Blake and losing him.</p><p>Aleks leaned in slowly and brushed his lips against mine. Then he dove out my open window and was gone.</p><p>I still felt the warmth of his lips against mine as I attempted to process him in my mind.</p><p>I got angry again, but I smiled. He hadn\u2019t bested me; he had come back and made me doubt my ability to be with anyone else, but never answered a single question. I, unlike him, was a mental case who contemplated everything. I had learned to shut my heart off, not around him, no, but when he was gone I could do it. I chuckled to myself. I could force myself to be the girl I was only weeks earlier.</p><p>I got dressed, more determined than ever to make things work with Shane, or at the very least, make it through the dance. Then I would take it one day at a time. Shane was the boy I had loved for a decade. It wasn\u2019t going to be work with him.</p><p>I made it down the stairs to see my sister watching TV with headphones on, listening to her iTouch. I laughed tapping her on the arm. \u201cHey, ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, shouting at me, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I pointed to her ears and she pulled the baby-blue head phones off, laughing. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She babbled the whole drive over to Giselle\u2019s parents\u2019 house. I tuned her out right away with my usual thoughts of how annoying I found her friends to be. I hated how the petty story she was telling was nothing but dribble. I stopped my thoughts mid criticism and looked at my sister. She was babbling and her story was dribble, but it mattered to her. She was a passionate person and where she rarely thought about anything, she felt everything. I admired my sister, and thankfully, I was still able to ignore the trashy story she tried to corrupt my intelligence with.</p><p>She parked in the driveway and waited for me. I walked up to the door and knocked. The house wasn\u2019t huge like Shane\u2019s or Blake's, but it was bigger than ours. It was a very large split level. Her dad opened the door looking very rough. His hair was ruffled and his eyes blood shot. I knew I had woken him, and he had been drinking every day he didn\u2019t spend at the hospital with Giselle.</p><p>\u201cHi sir. I'm Aimee James. Giselle told me to use her dress for the dance. Can I just come in and grab it?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a moment and then nodded. \u201cYeah, she told me about that. Come on in.\u201d He looked out at the driveway to see my sister wave at him. He waved back and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cHow is she feeling lately?\u201d I ask, trying to be casual. I felt nervous around him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot much better, but we heard yesterday that they may have found a donor. So, I guess she will hear tomorrow. How are you feeling?\u201d he asked, giving me a weird look.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBetter, thanks. Is her room this way?\u201d I asked, pointing up the stairs to the left.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cFirst door on the right. Everything is the same as it was before she got sick. I haven\u2019t been able to go in there.\u201d</p><p>I turned to smile at him but I saw the way he was looking at me. It made me feel dirty. He looked at me like the jeans and t-shirt I was wearing a bikini.</p><p>I turned and walked up the stairs very quickly, I didn\u2019t have the energy to run away from him, but I did my best. My heart was pounding and I thought about Shane. I needed Shane. He always saved me from my own ridiculous ways of putting myself in danger.</p><p>I got to the top of the stairs and entered her room. Her dad didn\u2019t follow me, but I closed her door anyway.</p><p>Her room was just like Alise\u2019s, a mess. There were clothes and shoes on the floor, with makeup all over a dressing table, and her bedding was ruffled all over her bed.</p><p>I walked to her closet and found the dress; it was in a dress bag. I didn\u2019t even worry about what it looked like. I saw papers on her floor in her closet. It was stationary with handwriting. It looked like poetry.</p><p>I crouched down, trying not to get dizzy as I looked closely at the letters. They were love letters of some sort, written to Giselle but not signed. I grimaced, seeing the wording of one, and I stuffed them in the dress bag. When I left the room, I looked around for her dad. He was at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cWant to stay for a drink?\u201d he asked, trying to smile. I nearly threw up in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, sir. My sister is waiting for me. Thanks though.\u201d I turned and ran out of the door.</p><p>I got back to the car and got in quickly. I was exhausted from the energy I had just put out and winded from exerting myself.</p><p>My sister looked at me worried. \u201cDid he touch you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head and breathed heavily. \u201cNo, he is just so creepy.\u201d</p><p>My sister put the car in reverse and sped from the driveway. \u201cYeah, tell me about it.\u201d Her eyes said a lot more than she was willing to share.</p><p>She snapped out of her thoughts. \u201cSo, you got the dress?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cAnd something else. Look at these.\u201d I unzipped the bag and pulled the letters out. \u201cHave your seen these before?\u201d I held out the papers.</p><p>My sister looked at the stationary. \u201cYeah, Giselle was getting letters for a while last fall. They were from a secret admirer. No biggie.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out the one that had caught my eye in the pile at Giselle\u2019s and held it up. \u201cDid you ever read them?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe glanced at them but they were so stupid, all romantic and quotes from Shakespeare and crap.\u201d</p><p>I read out loud, \u201cGiselle, my summer rose, your lips will shine for me, glisten with my name upon them. I will bring you to ecstasy with a drop of my aphrodisiacs. You'll moan my name and ride my\u2014\u201d I stopped and looked at my sister frowning. \u201cThis is disgusting. You're aware this isn\u2019t Shakespeare, right? Please tell me that all of the years of high school have not been wasted. Shakespeare never said the word \u2018cock\u2019 in a poem. If he had, it would have been about a rooster or a pun or innuendo of sorts.\"</p> <p>She glared at me. \"Spice down, saucy pants. You're being hamtarded about this.\"</p><p>I laughed at her using all the swear words I'd made up for her and asked, \"Giselle didn\u2019t have a clue who it was?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, driving us back home to get the dress fittings started.</p><p>I pulled my phone out of my pocket and looked at the million texts Giselle had sent me. It was pages of new texts. She went from excited to completely desperate. Guilt flooded me, seeing the anxiety in my friend's words.</p><p>I pressed talk and waited for the cell to ring.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Her voice was so weak it sickened me.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, fighting back tears. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, where have you been?\u201d Her weakened words cut me deeply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I slept through the last five days. I just couldn\u2019t seem to shake it. How\u2019s it going there? Your dad said something about a donor.\u201d</p><p>I could hear her shallow breath in the phone as she tried to talk. \u201cYeah, I hear the final verdict tomorrow, I think. Right now, they\u2019re just trying to get me through the days. My dad was the only match in my family, but his liver is damaged from all the drinking. I think he feels pretty bad.\u201d I cringed\u2014how could he not feel bad?</p><p>\u201cI am coming to see you this weekend, liver or no liver. I will be there this weekend, but right now, I need to ask you a question. It's going to sound awful, but just look past my snooping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not too worried about you and snooping to be totally honest.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI went to your place to get the dress and when I was there, I looked in the closet. I found the secret admirer letters you got last fall. I have been looking them over, and I think the person who sent them poisoned us. But I need to know who you think it was.\u201d I waited in silence for her to tell me to eff off and hang up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They just kept showing up in my locker. I guess I always thought it was Tommy. I assumed, because he had a crush on me, and he always got such good grades in English. It's surprising the way he comes off as a hamtard.\u201d</p> <p>I burst out laughing. \u201cSee how easy it is to use that word? Even Alise has been using it. Okay, so Tommy gets good grades in English? Really? I never would have guessed that. Were you sure he had a crush on you? Did he hit on you?\u201d</p><p>My sister, who was listening in, rolled her eyes at me. \u201cWho hasn\u2019t he hit on? He\u2019s a pig.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, imagining him being smart enough to drug someone and plan it out. I had a hard time seeing it in my head.</p><p>\u201cYou think about the letters for the next little bit, as much as you can, and I will see if I can get some dirt on Tommy. I\u2019ll get Alise to help me; she's good with dirty boys.\u201d I smiled at my sister, who flashed a grin and turned off the car.</p><p>\u201cI'll text you if I think of anything. I\u2019m telling you, if I don\u2019t get a response, I\u2019m coming for you, Miss James. I am coming for you.\u201d</p><p>The thought of that, made me smile. \u201cDeal. I will answer anything you send.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone, no doubt from loss of strength. I couldn\u2019t believe how weak she had gotten. I looked at my sister as we sat together in the driveway, feeling not only bleak about Giselle, but also confused about the drugging pervert.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be Tommy. I mean it could be, but I just can\u2019t see him being smart enough,\u201d I spoke, breaking the silence.</p><p>My sister nodded. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s a goof. He\u2019s a perve, but more of a harmless perve. Trust me, I went there once; he was very sweet and almost grateful. It was creepy, in a \u2018he\u2019s not as dirty as he seems\u2019, sort of way.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at her. \u201cYou had sex with him?\u201d</p><p>She frowned back. \u201cAt least I know what sex is. You\u2019re like a Mormon. No booze, no smoking, no drugs, no sex. Do you even drink coffee?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, shaking my head. \u201cNot really; every now and then I have some espresso. I don\u2019t like to put that much strain on my adrenal glands.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cOh well, yes\u2014I forgot about that nasty little side effect. Let\u2019s go see if the dress fits, Cinderella.\u201d</p><p>As Alise and I got into the house, we heard a man's voice talking to our dad. I knew that voice, immediately. Instead of smiling like I normally would, I cringed.</p><p>\u201cShane, what are you doing here?\u201d my sister asked, smiling at him and Dad. They were having what seemed to be an afternoon tea. I raised an eyebrow at them.</p><p>My dad started laughing. \u201cThey make the same faces. Do you see it, son?\u201d</p><p>Shane laughed nodding. \u201cThat is funny. Grey-blue eyes and silver eyes making the same expression. I was hoping you were feeling better.\u201d He smiled the biggest grin I\u2019d ever seen on anyone\u2019s face. The excitement in his eyes melted my heart. \u201cIs that your dress? Are we going?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were ridiculously hopeful. I couldn\u2019t even imagine saying no. \u201cYes. I\u2019m feeling a lot better.\u201d</p><p>It was still a lie, but I had been out of bed for the whole day. I could have fallen asleep standing, but my mind was reeling with all of the things it had learned. Or at least, attempted to learn in the small amount of time.</p><p>Shane stepped forward and hugged me tightly. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a couple hours to get you.\u201d</p><p>With that, he ran out the door, excited. I closed off my heart to Aleks and let Shane in. It was the right choice. I was excited and tired of the tennis match going on inside of me.</p><p>I went to my room to start the process and to contemplate a small catnap. I sat in my room staring at the letters. I knew the writing from somewhere. I couldn\u2019t place it. It reminded me of Blake, but when I thought about Blake and his chicken scratch, I shook my head. I knew it was like a word search. I needed to walk away from it and eventually the word would come to me.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Happiness is in the eye of the beholder . . . ???</p><p>The dress fit like a glove. Giselle and I were apparently the exact same size. It was an aqua-colored dress that was floor length in the back. It went from short in the front to long in the back, gradually, as it wrapped around me. The top was like a tight corset with the fabric folded vertically, but fastened tightly to the dress. It had an empire waist, with a large amount of the fabric pulled into a sweep, making it look like a belt. The belt went all the way around the dress, making up the small amount of back I had covered. It was strapless and the skirt of the dress was several layers of free-flowing, rippling fabric. There was a huge, oval broach under my right breast that was silver. It sparkled from the fake diamonds.</p><p>I shook my head in amazement as my sister smiled brightly. \u201cYou look hot. Like model hot.\u201d She pulled a pair of sparkling, silver pumps from her closet and put them in front of me. I stepped into them and marveled at how I looked. I pulled my light-blonde hair out of its usual ponytail and shook my head to release the long locks.</p><p>Alise clapped. \u201cDad, you have to see this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou even look a little tanned. Have you been tanning?\u201d she asked, looking me up and down as I gave her my 'remember who you are talking to' look.</p><p>She raised her hands defensively. \u201cI was just thinking that you seem a bit tanned.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, contemplating it. I did look a bit tanned. \u201cYou know, it's probably just a little of the jaundice left over from the poison.\u201d My normally extra-white skin did seem more golden, like Aleks'.</p><p>My dad came into the room. His eyebrows raised in stunned, shocked awe.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, Aimee. Alise, did you do this?\u201d His voice was a whisper, not accusing at all. He sounded proud of her.</p><p>Alise shook her head. \u201cNo, this is all Aimee, and there isn\u2019t even any makeup yet.\u201d She took a black and aqua-colored bracelet and hung it off my left wrist. She smiled at me in the mirror. I looked to see my dad's eyes mist over. My sister's eyes were not long behind him, which made my eyes start to water.</p><p>My dad wrapped his arms around us both and began to sob. He held us and hugged us tightly, with shaking arms.</p><p>I felt myself losing my control as I joined what was left of our small family in a moment of sorrow. I felt the warm wind. I looked up, knowing it was my mom watching down on us. My skin shivered as I let my face burrow into my dad's shoulder.</p><p>He pulled away after a few moments and nodded. \u201cYou look beautiful, and if your mom were here, she would make me tell you so.\u201d He walked from the room and I knew he was heartbroken.</p><p>Alise walked into her bathroom and started to wash her face to get ready for the big night. She looked over at me and smiled. \"I'll do your makeup, if you want.\"</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m going to try to do my own makeup this time. I think I\u2019m getting the hang of this girlie business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed at me from the bathroom. \u201cYeah right. Well, if you mess it up, I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>I closed her bedroom door, feeling more in love with my family than I ever had. I knew in that moment, we were going to be okay. My dad had muttered the words \u2018if your mom were here\u2019 for the first time, and we had all lived. We\u2019d cried together, we\u2019d grieved together, and it seemed we\u2019d finally reached the point where we could heal together.</p><p>I closed my door and sat at the chair, looking at myself. I was pretty; this had never happened to me before. Even with the red dress, I had still somehow looked like me, but in this dress I was someone else. I liked it. My gray eyes looked nice against the teal and my light, long blonde hair made me look like a mermaid. My puffy lips weren\u2019t chapped. They looked nice.</p> <p>I started to repeat the same thing Giselle had told me to do. I made my color choices to match the dress's accessories. I did my eyes with silver and grey. My eyes had flecks of both green and blue in them, so the silver made them sparkle. I did my lips with a soft coral, because I figured aqua and coral were both from the sea, so they must match. I pulled the top of my hair into a high, half ponytail and teased my ponytail waves into soft curls with mousse. I spritzed myself with the honey vanilla my mom had always worn.</p><p>I stood up, adding a little gloss, and looked at the final product.</p><p>The warm wind blew in my window, and Aleks stood there smiling at me from the far side of my room. My heart leapt, seeing him smile at me, but instantly I knew. The wind was the same. Exactly the same.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the warm wind.\u201d It was a statement, not a question.</p><p>He never opened his mouth to argue, but I could see the truth in his eyes.</p> <p>\"How could you let me believe that?\"</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He stepped toward me to explain, but I put my arms up. \u201cNo, you let me pretend you were my mom. How could you do it? I believed she was there with me. I believed all of my mom's love and intention was in that wind, and instead, it was you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, obviously ashamed. \u201cIt\u2019s just what happens when I move. You assumed it was your mom. You still needed her, and she was gone. I should have told you, and I\u2019m sorry, but in my defense, you should never have known about me. When you were better and your family was healed, I would have left. I would have gone, taking that wind with me, and you would have been at peace knowing she was in Heaven.\u201d</p><p>I felt betrayed and disgusted. I knew the common sense in what he was saying was there, somewhere, but I didn't want to acknowledge it. Instead, I thought about the millions of private things I had told him, thinking he was my mom. I felt the intrusion into my deepest thoughts.</p><p>I put my hands up to my lips, horrified. \"Oh my God. Oh my God\u2014I told you everything. I told you private things.\"</p><p>\"I just listened. You needed someone to listen.\"</p> <p>Tears threatened to ruin my efforts.</p><p>He ignored my words and walked to me, pulling me into him. He held me for a moment, talking, \u201cAimee, I'm so sorry. I wish I had more time to grovel appropriately, but I don\u2019t. I need you to try to not focus on hating me just yet. We need to focus on the thing we\u2019ve both dreaded\u2014I have to leave tonight. I can feel the pull.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to cry in frustration; he was like a roller coaster ride for my heart. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I let my head rule in the final verdict over what my response would be.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin my makeup, and this is my first time doing it completely on my own, which sounds ridiculous, and I know that. I need you to try to wait till the end of my night before ruining it.\u201d</p><p>I hated him for hurting me, but I wanted him to love me, and stay with me forever. It was too much.</p><p>He nodded and pulled back to look at me. \u201cYou are the most beautiful girl in the world.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and battled my insane urge to smash things over his head and then kiss him afterward.</p><p>His eyes grew dangerously intense. \u201cAre you still going with him?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, leaving it at that. Shane was my safe harbor. The place my heart was protected.</p><p>His eyes narrowed again and he pressed his lips into a tight smile. \u201cYou go and have a great night. I will see you after the dance, okay?\u201d He looked dark and serious. \u201cStay at his side the entire night.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will explain everything tonight before I leave, but promise me you'll stay by his side.\u201d</p><p>I agreed. \u201cFine. Since we are talking about the drugging rapist of doom, will you tell me one thing? Are the letters from him?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat letters?\u201d</p><p>I picked up the letter I had been reading from my dressing table. \u201cThese letters.\u201d</p><p>He read it and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It sounds pretty creepy.\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not psychic right. I'm not omnipresent like God.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI just thought you might know.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hands on my bare arms, warming me from the inside. I had been feeling weak and exhausted until he touched me.</p><p>He bent down and kissed my lips. He had meant to brush them lightly, but the goop on my lips trapped him. His hands went down my bare back, sending chills up my spine. They roamed my dress, landing on my butt and pulling me up into his arms. I kissed him back wildly, pulling at his shoulders.</p><p>He pulled away, covered in lipstick and gloss. He winced when he saw my makeup. I threw him a look of annoyance, but laughed at the ridiculous amount of lipstick he was wearing.</p><p>I turned away to clean my face off, but when I turned back to talk to him, he was gone. A cool wind came in the window, replacing the warm one.</p><p>I moaned as I sat back down to fix my face.</p><p>When I got downstairs, I got the speech of doom from my dad.</p><p>\u201cNo drinks you didn\u2019t crack open, and don\u2019t even drink from the water fountain. No boys, except Shane, and he doesn\u2019t touch you except to hold your hand at the most.\u201d Dad paced the kitchen, ranting as my sister and I exchanged looks of bewilderment. He seemed more savage than normal.</p><p>Shane knocked on the door, saving us from the chastity belts and curfews. I jumped at the door, feeling a slight head rush. I trembled a tiny amount before I got my hand on the door to steady myself.</p><p>Blake stood there in a tux beside Shane. Both were in black tuxes with shiny black shoes and white roses. I laughed. \u201cThe Blues Brothers are here.\u201d I opened the door up wide for them to come in.</p><p>My dad laughed at the comment, but my sister looked confused. \"They're wearing black, dummy.\" Yeah, I was the dummy.</p><p>Both guys looked astonished, as they stood completely still, staring at me.</p><p>I looked at my sister, who raised an eyebrow and shrugged.</p><p>Blake, finally taking at least one of his eyes off of me, turned to my sister. \u201cYou look incredible.\u201d</p><p>She really did. Her dress was silver like her eyes and cut perfectly. She had her dark, thick hair flowing around her shoulders, which were bare. Her skin was tanned and glowing. Her dress was a halter style with the thinnest straps imaginable and a cross-stitched pattern in silver beads and gems. It was a corset and skirt. The skirt was pleated and long with a soft flow and a shine to the silk material. She had blue eye makeup with plump pink lips. Her earrings were huge, silver dangling ones and that matched her crystal and silver bracelet. She had strappy, silver sling-backs on. She looked like a supermodel. When she turned around to say goodbye to me, I noticed her entire back was bare. The halter straps crossed thinly in the back and the skirt of the dress hugged the very top of her bum.</p><p>My dad gulped looking her sternly. \u201cSame rules apply for you.\u201d He shook as he looked at the guys. \u201cYou boys take good care of my girls, are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Blake nodded, but Shane had still not come out of his coma.</p><p>My dad snapped his fingers in front of Shane\u2019s eyes and smirked as Shane came back, blinking. \u201cYou look amazing, Aimee.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him and sipped my glass of water. I set it down and kissed my dad on the cheek. \u201cNight, Dad. Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He looked worried, regardless of what I said.</p><p>Alise kissed his cheek and patted his back. \u201cIt's okay, Daddy. I think I saw something about a special on Discovery Channel tonight about astro-psychics. Should be fun.\u201d</p><p>He nodded weakly and walked us to the door. \u201cIt's astrophysics, sweetie. I have it taping.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as she shrugged, not fazed, but Blake smirked. \u201cAstro-psychics, is that a space psychic?\u201d</p><p>She smacked him in the arm, making me laugh harder.</p><p>Shane offered me his arm, his gaze fighting desperately to focus on my eyes. Half my chest was exposed and my breasts were pretty much popping out the top of the dress. Not that much was left from the sickness, but what was there was fully exposed. I would have cursed Giselle under my breath, but she needed prayers more.</p><p>Before I took his arm, I hugged Blake.</p><p>He hugged me back.</p><p>\u201cI feel naked,\u201d I whispered to him.</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d He smiled at me as I pulled away. I knew we were going to be okay.</p><p>I looked around me and decided this was the life I wanted. When Aleks left, he would take a very large part of my heart with him. He would also take all of the air I had breathed for nearly a year, but I would survive on the air from the people surrounding me, and Giselle. I had survived heartbreak before, one much more severe than the imminent one would be.</p><p>I took Shane\u2019s arm and looked up at him. I felt butterflies as he squeezed my arm. He was warm and inviting. He was flesh and blood, and he didn\u2019t fly through the air or pretend to be something he wasn\u2019t. Shane had never lied to me about anything. In that moment, Shane\u2019s honesty was more attractive than a crooked smile and the bluest eyes ever created.</p><p>Shane kissed my cheek and turned us both around to face my dad. He put his hand out. \u201cGoodnight, sir, and don\u2019t worry; I will have her home at a respectable hour.\u201d</p><p>My dad tried hard to hide his love for Shane. \u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d he said sternly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blake followed Shane\u2019s lead, having never dated a real girl before, and put his hand out.</p><p>My dad smiled, looking at least a little relieved as we walked out onto the porch. He looked over at our dates once more. \u201cWell, you kids have a good time.\u201d</p><p>We walked out into the cool night air. Shane took me to his truck and opened the door. \u201cWow, Aimee, like wow. That dress and your hair. It\u2019s going to be a long night.\u201d He bent and kissed me. \u201cRemind me later that I have self-control, okay?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, giggling. \u201cOkay. You look great too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look like your butler. You look\u2014wow.\u201d He walked around to the other side of the truck, still talking to himself.</p><p>Blake took my sister to the car he had arranged, with a driver who stood before my sister in his suit and top hat. She waved at me as she gushed and climbed into the car.</p><p>I smiled at her, feeling so many good things all at once. I didn\u2019t have to fight to keep the bad things down deep. It seemed the wall I had built had crumbled down and filled in the moat. I didn\u2019t need any of it anymore. I didn\u2019t need Aleks either. I wanted him, but choosing him was like choosing a lifetime of heartache. I'd already suffered through that.</p><p>I looked out at the night sky as it darkened and made a mental note that I would let him go. I would let this be my life. Normal. It was secretly everything I had ever wished for. Secretly.</p> <p>We walked up to the huge doors of the school, where the dance was held in the gymnasium. The teachers were there with the spring formal committee. They were taking the five dollars the dance cost per person. Teachers were checking each person to see if any intoxicated people were coming in.</p><p>Police were standing around in plain clothes but with their weapons on their hips, like detectives in the city would wear. I breathed a small sigh of relief seeing Constable Bindley. He smiled at me, giving me a knowing look.</p><p>Shane paid our entrance fee and walked me in. Mr. Mac was already talking to Blake and laughing as my sister stood there looking confused.</p><p>Mr. Mac stopped talking when I walked in. He smiled at me, very nearly blushing. \u201cWell, well, Cinderella. You have cleaned up for the ball, I see. You look fantastic, kid. I always knew you had it in you.\u201d</p><p>I felt myself blushing, as Shane squeezed my arm. \u201cThanks. I feel a little weird being in a fancy dress, but this is my last chance at doing it.\u201d</p><p>He looked concerned. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood days and bad. Today is good.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed my arm. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to hear that. I have been very worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mr. Mac. I\u2019m just glad the year's almost up and I can take the summer to relax and focus on my health.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, school is almost up. Well, I better be getting back to chaperoning; I\u2019d hate for anyone to say I slacked off.\u201d He gave me a sideways glance, smiling one last time. I smiled back and let myself be dragged to the dance floor with Shane.</p><p>He looked down at me as he led me into a slow waltz. \u201cYou look incredible.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cYou said that already. I hate that I look like this amazingly-hot babe and everyone is nodding when they look at me. It's like my sister was right all along, that a little care and attention wouldn\u2019t have killed me. Of course, then everyone would have let me get by on my looks and not on my merit and hard work. That path leads to either marrying an old-ass billionaire or working at Target and everyone saying, 'Man, I bet she was something to look at back in the day.' You know?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAh, but you\u2019re still the bitter cynic that I love.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what I was about to say when he said the words, but I stopped breathing.</p><p>He bent to kiss my cheek. He lingered at the side of my face. \u201cI do love you, Aimee. I have loved you since we were five and you saved all the worms on the sidewalk when it rained in kindergarten. I\u2019ll never forget you putting them into a plastic pail. Hundreds of creepy slithering worms put in a pail, under the back deck at your house. You stayed with those dirty bastards until it stopped raining and then you released them.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed into his chest as he continued, \u201cI loved you in grade seven, when that girl Robin got picked on by the mean girls. You found the maxi pad colored with red felt stuck on her bag, and before anyone came around the corner, you grabbed it and stuck it to your bag. You think no one saw, but I did.\u201d I remembered that and the merciless torture I got for it.</p><p>My head was spinning but he continued, \u201cI loved you in grade ten when Grace Mellotti's dog got hit by that car and you carried him three miles to the vet's office. You saved his life, even though Grace had made your life hell.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the other side of my face. \u201cI loved you last summer so much, but when your mom got killed, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to ask you out. So, I went to your sister and asked her about you. She told me you were madly in love with that Blake kid and I thought I had missed the boat. I panicked while asking your sister about you and accidentally acted like I wanted to ask her out.\u201d His voice was filled with regret. \u201cI am so sorry I never manned up and just asked you out.\u201d</p><p>I laughed nervously. \u201cYou make me sound like a saint. I have done bad things in my life, FYI.\u201d My head was swimming in the emotions.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows in doubt.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cOkay, well not bad, but stuff. I\u2019ve lost library books and let my sister take the blame. I wanted to try to peroxide my doll's hair lighter than it is when I was in eighth grade, but I was nervous about doing it. She was my fav. I thought the bleach might ruin her hair, but I wanted it to match mine. So one night I filled a spray bottle with water and peroxide and I sprayed Alise\u2019s hair. In the morning, her hair was a tacky color of copper brown and all streaky. When my mom yelled at her for trying to dye her hair, I never fessed up that it was me. It cost my mom a fortune to fix it and Alise got so confused, she tells the story now like it was her idea.\u201d I still felt a small bit of shame for that one.</p><p>Shane laughed. \u201cYour sister was an evil brat, so it isn\u2019t hard to imagine her doing bad things like that. Surely your mom knew she was evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mom knew. Her sister is exactly the same.\u201d I looked him deeply in the eyes. \u201cShane, I am so lucky to be with you.\u201d I meant it.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDitto.\u201d We hugged and danced slowly, enjoying each other. I loved the fact that he was my history. He knew everything about me and remembered the things that made me proud of myself.</p><p>We danced for a few minutes before he stopped again and looked at me very seriously this time. \u201cWhere is that Aleks guy? Have you seen him?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, trying desperately to keep my emotions under check and not reveal anything in my looks. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him a few times, but he\u2019s not the bad guy. I know you want him to be, but he\u2019s really not. I saw the guy that day\u2014he had a different face than Aleks. Besides, Aleks is leaving town, tonight, I think.\u201d</p><p>\"Good.\" He nodded, processing the information. \u201cSpeaking of bad guys. I am joining the police force. I take the test in the city in two weeks.\u201d He said it and left it out there for me to think about or comment on.</p><p>I smiled at him, proud of him for making a choice that would better himself. Even more so, I was desperately grateful we could stop talking about Aleks. \u201cNice, good for you. That\u2019s a great fit for you, I think.\u201d</p><p>He watched my reaction, letting a smile grow on his face.</p><p>We had covered a lot of relationship areas in one night. It was a bit intense for my first dance, first boyfriend, and first love.</p><p>\u201cWill you wait for me?\u201d He raised his eyebrows and smirked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. It's only six months of training, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it isn\u2019t exactly a huge wait. What if I end up being a city cop?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cCross that bridge when we get there?\u201d</p><p>\"Okay. It\u2019s a long ways away. I\u2019m not even guaranteed to get past all of the tests. They\u2019re pretty intense.\u201d He kissed my hand. \u201cI just want us to be together, like boyfriend and girlfriend together. Are we there yet?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d I knew I had another door to close before we were completely there, but I wanted him more than anything else.</p><p>We stopped dancing and walked to the punch table where two parent chaperones stood watch. I smiled at them as Shane got us both a drink. I watched him drink his before I had any. He smiled, knowing what I was doing. \u201cIt\u2019s safe, Aimes\u2014that\u2019s Becky Magee\u2019s mom. She\u2019s a Baptist.\u201d</p><p>I drank the punch.</p><p>We went and sat at a table where my sister and Blake were sitting with a few other people.</p><p>I smiled at Shane. \u201cSo, the police force... I watched a show on it once. It was brutal. It\u2019s like the marines. Police boot camp is savage, but the guys seemed so confident and proud of their accomplishments there. Are you excited?\u201d I asked, trying to keep the conversation light.</p><p>\u201cI saw that one too. It looked pretty intense. Yeah, I\u2019m excited, but I have a long process before I'm in.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to encourage him; his parents were living for themselves and he had such potential. It would be a shame for him to spend his life in our little town.</p><p>I looked down the table at Blake, who looked happy talking to my sister. She looked partly mystified and the rest happy.</p><p>The girl next to us was named Nadine. She was one grade behind us. Her boyfriend, William, was in graduating with us. She smiled at me, as Shane started talking to Tommy, who was beside him. My sister tried to be discreet as she eyeballed Tommy and then me.</p><p>I nodded slowly, as if not responding to her. We both were watching him, when Nadine whispered to me, \u201cYou look pretty. I didn\u2019t even recognize you. You look like a model. Like your sister.\u201d It was a backhanded compliment, but I knew she meant well.</p><p>I smiled at her. \u201cThanks. You do too.\u201d Her long brown hair was pulled up into a French twist and her yellow-satin halter dress was very form fitting. She looked amazing for a sixteen-year-old, more like twenty-five. I assumed that was the point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you heard how Jaime is doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, I have been meaning to go see her. Have you heard?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYesterday I heard that she woke up but that she doesn\u2019t remember anything. She seems to be on the mend, I guess. Kind of creepy, huh\u2014the whole thing?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, watching Tommy talk to Shane. His lips were full and thick. He had crooked teeth in the front. He had a very tiny mole on his left cheek, low on his face. None of which the rapist had. Tommy was creepy enough to do a lot of things, but I could never believe him to be that creepy.</p><p>The dance was a booming success, not that I had anything to compare it to. My sister appeared to be having a great time with her friends. I worried about Blake though. At one point he made eye contact with me. He looked uncertain of his surroundings, but also of us. I smiled, hoping to reassure him that we were fine. It was a conversation that was eventually going to have to happen, but not right then.</p><p>I was starting to feel light-headed and excused myself to go to the bathroom. I couldn\u2019t focus my eyes and I was starting to sweat a little. Shane gave me a worried look, but I shook my head at him and walked toward the bathroom.</p><p>Mr. Mac walked toward me, smiling. \u201cHey kid, you look a little pale. You feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah, just still a bit weak, I guess. Who knows how long that\u2019s going to last.\"</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had quite the year, haven\u2019t you? Well, take it easy.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me like my dad did sometimes. Usually when I got caught for going along with whatever bad idea my sister had convinced me of.</p><p>I walked around the corner to the girl\u2019s bathroom. I barely made it into the bathroom when I started to pass out. I felt a warm breeze and slipped into Aleksander's arms. I couldn\u2019t see him. My world went black.</p><p>Everything was dark and calm and then I heard a voice. \u201cAimee, please wake up. Please or I\u2019m taking you back to the hospital. Please wake up.\u201d I felt my lips curl up into a smile. I could feel his warm touch on my arm. I was safe as long as he was there.</p><p>I strained to open my eyes, but the focus took longer than I expected. \u201cAleks, you're here?\u201d I knew the answer, but I needed to be sure I wasn\u2019t dreaming.</p><p>My eyes fuzzed out and then focused on his worried face. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here baby. Just hold onto me. Did you drink anything at the dance?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cJust the punch the Baptists were guarding. It was clean, trust me. Everyone else is fine. I think it\u2019s my liver still. I've been getting sicker and sicker except when I'm with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay any longer. I feel the pull already taking me somewhere else. But I can\u2019t leave you sick like this. None of this should have happened.\u201d His voice was thick with emotion. \"This is all my fault. I've made such a mess.\"</p><p>\u201cIt's not you're fault. You always make me feel better. Just being near you is enough.\u201d I smiled trying to reassure him.</p><p>He closed his eyes and groaned. \u201cNooooo. Oh no. I\u2019ve done this to you. You\u2019re in liver failure; that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with you. I am an idiot.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, the doctors said I was fine. My eyes aren\u2019t yellow and my skin is only slightly yellow. I have energy, not much, but some. I would be weak and sick all the time if I was in liver failure.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m here, you\u2019re going to feel fine. It's only the symptoms that are being masked, not the actual problem. Like that headache you had that I took away. I never cured the headache, only made the pain go away. I\u2019ve been touching you and near you so much that it\u2019s masked your illness. We need to get you back now. Your liver probably was fine when you left the hospital, but it went sometime in the last couple weeks. \u201d</p><p>I nodded looking around. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, making my heart skip a few beats. \u201cThe beach I took you to the first night.\u201d</p> <p>I looked around me and saw it all clearly now, the waves crashing and the sand beneath me. The cool ocean air was clearing my head.</p><p>I felt a tear starting to well in my eyes. \"Are you really going to leave me forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to stay.\u201d His words felt like swords slicing into me. I had spent so long trying not to feel anything. Then he came along and not only tore down the wall I had built, but burned the whole village down. There were no survivors. Looking at him, I knew what I wanted in life, even if my life was only going to be a few hours longer. Choosing Shane was my heart and my head. Aleks was all heart.</p><p>\u201cI need to go back to the school for a minute. I need to say goodbye to my sister and Shane and Blake.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, as he bent down and picked me up. He tensed like he was about to take off again. \u201cI need to take you to the hospital now.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI know what happens to someone who goes into liver failure. I am at least a couple hours by helicopter from a major hospital. In this small town, I will be dead by morning. I will be flown to the city the minute I get to the hospital. That means that I won't be seeing anyone else for a while. I need to tell them I\u2019m okay. They\u2019re going to worry if I don\u2019t, and I can't explain how I got myself to a hospital. Not without outing you on the weird traveling thing you do. They\u2019ll send out a search party.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tensed and the warm wind came. I leaned into him as much as I could, taking as much of the painkiller off of his skin as I could. I didn\u2019t understand the science behind a person giving off a soothing pheromone that stopped pain, but in that moment I didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t try to understand; I was too tired. My skin felt like it was in a cold fire, and my head was starting to pound so much, my eyes burned.</p><p>I took in deep breaths of him. I needed every drop of him, before he was gone forever. I couldn\u2019t think about it just yet. All I wanted was to enjoy every last second. When I was with him, it was like I didn\u2019t pick Shane. Like that while with him, I had no choice but to love him.</p><p>He walked in through the back door of the school at the gymnasium entrance and put me down outside of the bathroom. \u201cNo one but you can see me right now, okay? So don\u2019t talk to me. I will walk with you and keep a hand on you at all times.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, wanting to look up into his blue eyes and get lost. Maybe press myself up against him and kiss him until I died peacefully. I would give up my forever to be with him for that last day. Something about him made my body come alive.</p><p>As we walked from the hallway, he held a hand on my shoulder, making me feel weird. I knew it was essential to have him touching me if I wanted to stay upright.</p><p>I saw Shane looking at me oddly. He stood from the table and walked over frowning. \u201cHey, you okay? You look sick.\u201d He reached down and picked up my hands. I felt awkward with him touching my hands and Aleks holding my shoulder, like my love triangle had come to its head.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m getting my dad to come get me. I feel sick again. I need to go back to the hospital. Thanks for bringing me here.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed my cheek. \u201cThanks for coming with me, Aimee. You\u2019ve made this the best night of my life. I\u2019ll walk you out and come with you.\u201d</p><p>I felt dirty and panicked. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. Stay and enjoy. He\u2019s waiting for me outside. Seriously, don\u2019t worry. Tell my sister and Blake I went with my dad, okay? I need you to stay and make sure my sister is okay, you know\u2014the rapist.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and frowned. \u201cI should come with you; your dad won't mind.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah, but he wants me to go with him, just me. He said he wants to talk about something.\u201d I seriously was the worst liar ever; four-year-olds could be more convincing.</p><p>I felt my stomach twisting with the guilt and lies as Shane\u2019s face filled with disappointment. \u201cOkay. Well, let me walk you out.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what else to say, so I turned and started to walk out. The music was at a quiet moment in between songs. Then somewhere in the crowd I heard it.</p><p>The bird squawk ringtone.</p><p>It happened once and then again, just like in the woods. I turned, looking around to see Mr. Mac pick his phone out of his pocket as he answered it. I looked at his mouth as he was talking, his thin lips moving quietly into the phone. How had I missed how thin his lips were?</p><p>His eyes shot over to me, seeing the look of recognition on my face. He turned to leave the gym quickly.</p><p>\u201cShane\u2014it\u2019s Mr. Mac. It\u2019s him! He\u2019s the rapist,\u201d I shouted, pointing. The room began to spin in confusion as Shane ran and tackled the fleeing teacher.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch.\u201d He held him facedown on the hard floor and sat on his shoulders, pinning him to the ground.</p><p>Mr. Mac was a strong-looking man, but Shane was very imposing standing next to him. Sprawled out on top of him, it was clear Mr. Mac didn\u2019t stand a chance. Shane played football and weight lifted. Mr. Mac was a nerd, a fit nerd, but a nerd nonetheless.</p><p>I watched Blake come running over, looking outraged at Shane. I shook my head. \u201cNo Blake, it\u2019s him. He did this to me. He is the rapist.\u201d</p><p>Blake shook his head in disbelief as his mentor was held on the ground. My sister was already calling for the police officers in the corridors, as were a few others, no doubt. Mrs. Sinclair, our principal, was trying to break up the fight. Everyone was attempting to explain the struggle to her, before she helped free the pervert.</p><p>Mr. Mac turned his face and looked at me. His thin lips curled up into a smile. His always-friendly eyes turned merciless as he watched me. I felt dirty knowing what his intentions had been in the woods that day. His face would haunt my dreams forever. His look sent a shiver down my spine.</p><p>I felt the warm air fill the space around me and I knew, that no matter what, in that moment I was at least safe from the stalker. Shane looked back at me to see if I was okay, his worried face ripping my heart out. I hated that I had betrayed his trust and love for me. I didn\u2019t know my own heart. Somehow I couldn\u2019t stop myself from loving them both. I knew I should have been honest about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The stress of the moment was more than I could bear, and I felt myself shiver with the cold burning skin again. I was slipping away.</p><p>I dialed my cell phone. \u201cDad, meet me at the hospital. I\u2019m going there now. I\u2019m fine, but I think my liver is still sick.\u201d I hung up before he could ask questions I didn\u2019t want to answer.</p><p>I felt a tug on my shoulder as I was steered to the bathroom. In the chaos, I got away before anyone noticed me leaving again. Aleks picked me up and ran out the back door as again I slipped out of consciousness.</p> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Eternity is a long time to be dead.</p><p>\u201cThere is no way we can treat her here. The helicopter will be here in about fifteen minutes. She needs to go to Portland,\u201d a woman spoke.</p><p>\u201cThis is just insanity\u2014she seemed to be getting better. She was just sleeping a lot. The doctor said she needed a lot of sleep.\u201d My dad sounded stressed.</p><p>I opened one of my eyes to see Aleks beside my bed holding my hand. His eyes seemed haunted, as if he were looking at a ghost. I took that as a bad sign. The pain was gone completely. I wondered if it was him or drugs preventing me from feeling the brutal agony.</p> <p>His hard face was tragically beautiful, but like all great works of art, he had a flaw. I could read his face like a book. He was leaving me or was I leaving him; I just didn\u2019t know which one it was. It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d I whispered, so my dad wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>Aleks closed his eyes for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I should already be at my next place, but I can\u2019t leave you. I can fight the urge to leave a while longer, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you ever come back?\u201d my whisper cracked under the emotional strain.</p><p>He bit his upper lip. He was hesitating and finally sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I felt a tear slip from my tired eyes and I whispered, \u201cThen just leave now and let me die in peace.\u201d</p> <p>He gripped my hand harder. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. I love you more than anything. I can't bear the thought that I will have to leave you, let alone live in a world where you don\u2019t exist.\"</p><p>\"Just leave. I want to die in peace.\" He took a step away from me and was across the room in an instant.</p><p>My dad came to my bedside, his eyes puffy and distressed. \u201cAimes. Hey kiddo, you\u2019re awake. You\u2019re leaving for Portland here in a minute. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, licking my lips. \u201cPretty good, Dad, just tired.\u201d I looked behind my dad to see the older police officer. \u201cCorporal Williams,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He nodded at me and walked into the room. \u201cI just want you to know that we have him, and it's air tight. His house was full of the stuff to make the drugs. We have everything being sent to labs to ensure it\u2019s the same, but I know it is. We found a shrine to your friend Giselle, pictures of your sister and Jaime. His handwriting appears to match the love letters too. So, I want you to be able to go to the city at peace with this.\u201d His eyes glistened as he put a hand on my dad's shoulder and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>Aleks stood in the corner of the room, watching me intently. I had a hard time looking at anyone but him. I wanted him to be mine. I wondered if I died, if we could be sort of angels together. I could live with that option.</p><p>I looked at my dad\u2019s sad face and felt guilty for even feeling okay with dying to be with a boy.</p> <p>\u201cTake care and I hope you have a speedy recovery. See you around, Don.\u201d The corporal left.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d My dad smiled at him and turned back to me. \u201cWell, at least that part is over.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, not sure whether to throw up or go back to sleep.</p><p>The stretcher came as Shane did. He looked sexy. He was changed into jeans and a t-shirt that stretched across his chest.</p><p>He smiled as he ran his hands through his hair. \u201cAimee, you are by far the worst prom date\u2014 ever.\u201d He knelt at my bedside and kissed my hand. I looked to the corner to see Aleks's jaw clench. His eyes looked savage as he watched Shane kiss my hand and my cheek. Shane's face was a mess.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it was my pleasure.\u201d I smiled back at him.</p><p>His face was full of tension he was working hard to contain.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re taking her now, Shane. Are you coming with me to Portland?\u201d</p><p>I was stunned my dad asked him that.</p><p>Shane nodded. \u201cYeah. I'll drive, Mr. James. You look beat.\u201d</p><p>He never took his eyes off of me as he spoke. It was comforting, knowing I was going to have him there for my dad.</p><p>The quiet of the hospital broke with the shrill screams of my sister. \u201cAimee, Aimee!\u201d She was searching for me. No doubt running through the halls of the hospital in her full gown. I could swear I heard her heels clicking.</p><p>Her face was panic stricken as she jumped on me, crushing me a little.</p><p>\u201cAimes, oh my God. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded as her skinny arms choked me. \u201cYeah, just need to go to the city and get checked out.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, taking a huge gulp. \u201cThey took Jaime too, this afternoon. I think that fucker should get a life sentence. Or a death sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlise!\u201d my dad whispered harshly.</p><p>Alise frowned at him. \u201cWell, I do. His drug's a poison that\u2019s nearly killed everyone I love. I can say whatever I want.\u201d Alise started to cry. I wanted to comfort her, but she just did the drama so well I could barely watch. She sat still on my bed, looking at me with tears running down her perfect face onto her full lips. Her eyes looked like molten silver, they were so shiny.</p><p>Blake walked in looking worried but also confused. He was still in shock. He obviously couldn't believe that the man he had loved so dearly could have been the rapist. I was having a hard time believing it myself. I had adored him as a teacher too. I found no comfort in the fact that he hadn\u2019t meant for it to be me. I wasn\u2019t part of his evil plan or his shrine. I was an accidental victim. It was no consolation to me.</p><p>The ambulance and helicopter people walked into my room, after waiting in the hall to allow my family time to say goodbye. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait any longer. Sorry, folks,\u201d one of them said sympathetically.</p><p>My dad kissed my cheek. \u201cSee you in a few hours, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back so Alise could have her moment. \u201cAimee, be strong and get better, okay?\u201d She kissed my cheek leaving sticky lip gloss all over. I rubbed it off, frowning at her, which she ignored, walking into Blake\u2019s arms.</p><p>Blake hugged her and then walked to me. \u201cI miss you in class, Aimes. You need to get better so we can hang out a little more.\u201d I nodded, and tried to ignore the lump in my throat. He kissed me on the cheek and whispered in my ear, \u201cI love you, Aimes. You\u2019re my best friend.\u201d He stood wiping his eyes and walked away with Alise. He put an arm around her as she sobbed.</p><p>Shane knelt back at my bedside. \u201cI love you, Aimee. I will bring your dad to the hospital. Don\u2019t worry about him. I will see you in a few hours.\u201d He kissed me on the lips, just brushing them. My eyes flickered to Aleks who stood in the corner brooding. His huge Viking presence wasn\u2019t improving. He looked as angry as he could get. His fists were clenched and his face was furious.</p><p>I glanced back at Shane, who was standing with the bleakest look on his face. He walked from the room as the men came to transfer me. I felt weak as they helped me onto the stretcher, but my eyes never left Aleks' s face. He looked broken but stayed with me as we wheeled out to the helicopter. He climbed on board sitting beside me, never taking his eyes off of me.</p><p>The new hospital room was a lot bigger with machines everywhere. I was put on dialysis just as Giselle had been, and Jaime was on currently. We were all on the same floor but different rooms. Aleks stayed beside my bed, still not speaking, which made me nervous. He seemed to be in a severe struggle to remain with me. I knew he would leave sooner than later.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I die and become like you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m cursed. Besides, I would never want this for you. Eternity is a long time.\u201d</p><p>He walked toward me and picked up my frail hand.</p><p>I moved as well as I could, so he could lie beside me.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\" I whispered.</p><p>He frowned, laying down beside me. \u201cYou will always have my heart, Aimee. You are everything I needed to feel again, and I thank God every day that we met. I was a shell for hundreds of years, and you\u2019ve awakened my soul again. But there is no way that I would deny you the freedom of the afterlife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there others like you?\u201d I asked staring up at the ceiling, feeling his warmth beside me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, some things close to what I am,\u201d he spoke quietly and I understood his lack of want to speak of it.</p><p>\u201cHave you met them?\u201d I asked, treading carefully; I wanted him to answer.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He was still so reserved.</p><p>\u201cTell me something, Aleks. Something you don\u2019t want to. Just one thing and I won't ask any more questions.\u201d My throat was hurting from the amount of tears that had sat in it for hours.</p><p>Aleks hesitated and processed what lame thing he could tell me to get me off his back, just as a dark figure appeared in the doorway.</p><p>Aleks was off the bed within a second and pinning a dark-haired man against a wall.</p><p>He laughed, holding his hands in the air. \u201cSo, she can see you, brother? Did you offer her immortality to save her life just yet?\u201d he asked in an English accent. His dark eyes were unbearable to look at. He had the blackest eyes ever, like his pupils were the only things there. He was considerably shorter than Aleks, but something about the way he stood commanded respect. His face was that of an incredibly young man. I would guess twenty-five at most. His confidence and smile contradicted his dimples and soft face. He dressed different from Aleks as well, more J.Crew and clean cut. Aleks always looked like he was going backpacking. The dark-haired man was wearing khakis with a white, long-sleeve dress shirt open casually. He looked like he should be on a beach somewhere. His dark hair was styled funky. He clearly cared a lot about how he looked. He winked at me and the two men were gone. I was alone with a million more questions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But mostly, I just felt betrayed and disappointed that he didn\u2019t offer me immortality. He didn\u2019t even try to save me. He was accepting my illness and possible death instead of bearing the thought of me with him for the rest of his life. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I sat on my bed alone and frustrated, when Jaime walked in. She looked amazing. Her face was healthy again, not sallow and gaunt like mine was. She smiled brightly at me.</p><p>\u201cJaime.\u201d I felt hopeful, if she looked that good from the dialysis, maybe I would be on the mend too. Then I could go back to Shane and forget all about Aleks.</p><p>Her eyes looked a little funny, too sparkly maybe. \u201cHey, Aimee. How are you feeling?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cNot so good. You look good though.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and sat on my bed. \u201cYeah, I finally feel great. I think that last bit of meds really just did me in. I\u2019m finally better.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThey caught him. It was Mr. Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Him?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know, right. He was always so nice to me.\u201d</p> <p>She frowned. \u201cNot me. He was a dick to me. Once he kicked me out of class, and when we were in the hall, he yelled at me. He told me to stop dressing like a slut unless I wanted to be treated like one. He said I deserved to be treated like a slut.\u201d Her face grew sad for a moment.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDon\u2019t believe anything he said. He\u2019s a criminal and a pervert. Have you seen Giselle?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah, she got her liver transplant notification. It's on, as soon as they get the organ here. She\u2019s looking pretty bad right now.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cAt least she's getting the transplant. That\u2019s fantastic news.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Aleks unexpectedly walked through the doorway, he looked nervously at Jaime. Jaime smiled at him. \u201cAre you him?\u201d</p> <p>My heart skipped a beat as Aleks's face stayed very calm, but his eyes were screaming at me. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOkay, well I guess I better go back to my room, so he knows where to find me.\u201d</p><p>Confusion had me spinning in circles. \u201cYou can see him?\u201d I asked Jaime.</p><p>She laughed and nodded. \u201cYeah, Aimee, I\u2019m surprised you can, though. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good sign.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Aleks and waited for some kind of answer, but he offered nothing. As usual.</p><p>The dark-haired man walked back in the doorway. He smiled at Jaime briefly, but then focused his eyes on me. I felt uncomfortable with his eyes on me. It was like he was undressing me, even in my weak and dying state. He stood behind Aleks, who was also watching me intently. Jaime walked from the room, squeezing past them both.</p><p>She turned and looked back at me. \u201cI hope you make it, Aimes. Say goodbye to your sister for me.\u201d She walked out of the room, leaving me with the two men and no clue what was going on. I had a guess, but it was not realistic. \u201cIs. She. Dead?\u201d The words left my lips, sounding empty.</p><p>Aleks nodded. He looked as if he wanted to speak, but never did.</p> <p>I started to cry. \u201cShe died.\u201d My statement made me feel worse. \u201cIf she died then I\u2014\u201d I stopped myself, before I could say it.</p><p>Aleks was across the room in one long step. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t die like her. The dialysis is already helping and there is hope of a liver. Giselle is getting hers as soon as it gets here.\u201d His eyes were trying to hypnotize me, but I was too scared to buy into it.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThe odds of two livers showing up are slim to none. Who are you?\u201d I asked the guy standing in the doorway, still watching me intently.</p><p>He grinned at me. \u201cI am Aleks\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're cursed to help people, too?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNot so much, love. I am sort of the opposite of that.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at Aleks, who sighed. \u201cHe is like a dark angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a demon?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and Aleks looked back at him. \"I like to think of him that way.\"</p><p>\u201cIs everything true? Is there a tooth fairy and goblins, as well?\u201d I felt overwhelmed, as tears streamed down my cheeks.</p><p>The demon shook his head. \u201cPretty sure the tooth fairy is a fairy tale. Goblins are fairly hard to find nowadays.\u201d</p><p>I snorted and grabbed a tissue to wipe my face. \u201cThis is bullshit. I am sick and dying. My friend has just died. My other friend is waiting for a transplant, and you are an immortal not-quite-angel and an immortal demon. You immortals really feel the need to hang out in my room and rub your immortality in my face. Piss off.\u201d I didn\u2019t look at either of them. When Aleks tried to touch me, I pulled away. I winced, as the arm I jerked had my I.V. in it. The stabbing pain of the I.V. caused me to shake, as I pulled it into my chest to protect it.</p><p>The pain was more than I could take.</p><p>I felt hatred burn my eyes as I glared at Aleks. \u201cI will never have children to tell about my mom. She will never live on in their memory. I will never go to university. I will never fall into a love so deep that can't be cured. I will never get married and have someone believe in me so truly that they are willing to bet their future on me. I\u2019m dying, because you didn\u2019t do a very good job as my guardian angel. This is your fault. You could have told me about Mr. Mac and spared Jaime her fate. Everything is your fault. I hate you and I want you to go away and never come back.\u201d Tears streamed down my cheeks, as pain ripped me apart. The heart monitors started to go wild, making all kinds of noise.</p><p>Aleks' beautiful blue eyes filled with tears and heartbreak as he left my side. He walked out the doorway.</p><p>Nurses came running past him with needles and stethoscopes. I blacked out, seeing the demon still standing in the doorway. The look in his eyes bothered me. It was smug, as if he enjoyed what he\u2019d seen.</p><p>But then everything went black.</p><p>A dark voice taunted me from my drug coma. \u201cAimee, Aimee.\u201d</p><p>I struggled to get my eyes open, hearing my name. It felt like a crust had closed them up tight. I managed to get one open and focused it on the young face of the stranger.</p><p>\u201cAh, there you are. Right, first thing\u2019s first. Your family is nearly here, which will be bad timing, I\u2019m afraid. You see, I have something I could give you. It would help you through this illness. But it needs to happen before you die, or it won't work.\u201d His English accent made me happy. He sounded like Wallace from Wallace and Grommit. I didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. I struggled with the other eye and finally got it open as well. I blinked, focusing on him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very young; you look my age but you seem older,\u201d I whispered, not sure if it had been out loud or not.</p><p>He nodded shamelessly. \u201cYes, I am. Now do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the doorway. \u201cIn about thirty minutes your family is going to walk through that door, and then it will be too late.\u201d</p><p>Still confused, I shook my head and closed my eyes again, I was so tired. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to live, Aimee?\u201d His words burned through me, and my mind screamed yes.</p><p>I opened my eyes again, fighting to stay awake. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou need to do something. It\u2019s going to hurt a lot. Not right away, but eventually it will.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt more than it does now. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me. \u201cDorian. Now the important parts of this moment are as follows. You need to bite the inside of your mouth and make it bleed, I will do the same. We will then kiss and my blood will mix with yours in your mouth and you will swallow it.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the doorway. \u201cLook before Aleks changes his mind and comes back to stop this, you need to do it.\u201d</p><p>I thought for a moment. \u201cWill I die?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a death of sorts. You\u2019ll be just like Aleks, live forever and that sort of nonsense. One day you will forgive him for his part in all of this. For now, you need to do as I say. The window is passing rapidly.\u201d</p><p>I panicked, not sure what I was getting myself into. Everything hurt; I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I nodded and bit down on my lip as hard as I could. It didn\u2019t bleed at first, only stung.</p><p>I cringed in pain and took a deep breath. I bit the other side, gasping as blood started to stream into my mouth. He did the same without even flinching. He smiled wickedly and bent his beautiful face down into mine. I saw the trace of a dark liquid on the crease of his closed lips. It looked like molasses and made me want to throw up. Instead I let him kiss me.</p><p>The kiss was intense, his lips moving quickly and hungrily into mine. His tongue flicked into my mouth, driving itself in. He grabbed the back of my head and pulled me into the kiss.</p><p>I wanted to be repulsed but something about him was drawing me in. I let myself be taken by the kiss. Our mouths moved like wild animals. It was as if we couldn\u2019t get enough of each other. He grabbed my hair at the back of my head and pulled my face from his. His lips were covered in a mixture of his black blood and my red. His mouth had tasted of the rust from my blood and a sweet musk from his.</p><p>I exhaled as he held my face back from his. He was still pulling my hair, and oddly enough, I didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cYou\u2019re a very naughty girl, aren\u2019t you, Aimee? I wish we had a little more time. I think that there is something of yours I would like very much to have. Unfortunately, your dad will be here in about twenty-eight minutes. I will be back, and maybe you can give me the other thing I want.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to play dumb and pretend I had no clue what he wanted, but my body was responding to him. I wanted to give him the thing he sought out, and the idea of it made me blush. I imagined the weight of him on top of me, pressing me into the hospital bed. I shook off the thought and frowned at him. He was enjoying the effect he had on me.</p><p>\u201cDorian, would I have died by the time my dad got here? Is that why you rushed this?\u201d I asked not sure about anything that had happened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded. \u201cYou would have, yes, but my blood will heal everything, just as it will take everything. You\u2019ll seem better to your dad and the doctors for a few hours, maybe days. It will be long enough to get you out of here in time.\u201d</p><p>I did feel better instantly. I felt strong again. I looked down at my hand where the I.V. was and frowned. It was annoying me, like my skin was trying to heal it over.</p><p>\u201cWhen you forgive Aleks, tell him he owes me a LOT\u2014he owes the Roses.\u201d His emphasis on lot scared me, as did the dark, sinister look he got in his eyes.</p> <p>Things were different inside of me. I felt a hot wave of healing rush through me. I wasn\u2019t sick. I didn\u2019t hate Aleks as much. I knew I would forgive him. Even more, I hoped he would forgive me for saying the awful things I had said. I wanted to see Shane.</p><p>\u201cDorian, I don\u2019t understand Aleks. He has powers, he kind of flies, he\u2019s beautiful, his touch soothes me, he can be invisible, and he will live forever, but he won't tell me how he became this way. He said a werewolf or shape shifter killed him before it was his time. What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Dorian wiped his mouth and then mine. He was extra careful with my lips as he wiped them.</p><p>\u201cIt means that.\u201d He sighed and continued, \"Exactly that. A shape shifter killed him.</p><p>\"Why did he have to come to my family?\"</p> <p>His eyes sparkled like the stars in the night sky, as his lip twitched into a smile. \u201cWell, surely you know the part about his dad? Whenever his father kills someone, Aleks is responsible for the family. Like punishment for his father's sins, he must heal the family. It's a way to ensure he suffers for all of his life. Blah, blah, blah.\"</p><p>I was frozen. \u201cMy mom? His dad killed my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, I guess Aleks left that little chestnut out, did he? Well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll want to ask him about it when you next see him.\u201d</p><p>I trembled in disbelief.</p><p>He looked pleased with what he had caused inside of me and clapped his hands together. \u201cOn that lovely note, your dad is early, and so I will leave you for a while. I will be back, so don\u2019t worry, I won't let you change alone.\u201d He left quickly, before I could ask what he meant by the statement.</p><p>My dad came rushing in seconds later. \u201cAimee, oh thank God. You\u2019re still awake.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned at him. \u201cYeah, why?\u201d My dad's face made me sad. Had my mom had an affair with Aleks's dad? How had he been involved in her death?</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOh, uhm, no reason. We just thought you\u2019d be sleeping.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Shane, who came into the room directly after my father. Shane looked relieved as well. I smiled seeing him. He made me feel happy and safe.</p><p>\u201cDid the doctors tell you I would be in a coma before you made it here?\u201d</p><p>Shane nodded behind my lying dad's shaking head. \u201cNo, kiddo. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cReally good.\u201d</p><p>I felt sick as I saw hope in my dad's eyes and then watched as it extinguished. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve had that before. It might be the liver dialysis. Has a doctor been by to see you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot recently.\u201d I remembered the attack I had had hours before. Mostly I remembered everything I said to Aleks. I had broken his heart. I wasn\u2019t certain I was sorry for hurting him with all the truths he\u2019d kept from me.</p> <p>\u201cYou look better.\u201d Shane came and sat on my bed, holding my hand. I licked my lips, smelling him\u2014he smelled delicious. Something about him was making me hungry for something I couldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>I felt disgusted with myself. I was becoming a super slut. Something about all the guys in my life was making my hormones go crazy. I chalked it up to inactive hormones for too many years. My hormones had been released late and they were desperate to catch up.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Alise? She didn\u2019t come?\u201d I asked trying to divert my thoughts from kissing Shane and thinking about Aleks or worse, Dorian.</p><p>My dad shook his head. \u201cShe isn\u2019t taking the news very well.\u201d</p><p>Shane shot my dad a look. My dad's face flushed as he stumbled over his words. \u201cYou know, of you being sick.\u201d</p><p>I nodded knowingly. They were speaking of Jaime\u2019s death. \"It\u2019s okay, Dad; I know. I know she passed. She came and said goodbye.\u201d I had said it before I thought about it.</p><p>My dad frowned. \u201cYou saw her?\u201d</p><p>I nodded slowly. \u201cIn a dream. I had an episode a few hours ago and I dreamed of her. She said goodbye. I just knew.\u201d</p><p>\"A dream?\"</p><p>I nodded, but my eyes wandered out into the halls. I hoped to see Aleks, but he never came back. I wanted answers more than I wanted anything. Well, except to touch Shane and pull our clothes off, possibly rubbing our naked skin against each other. I blushed, trying hard to focus on the anger and worry and the other things I was facing.</p><p>AFTER . . .</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Never trust anyone with obsidian eyes, just saying.</p><p>I wanted to go back to sleep, but for some reason I wasn\u2019t tired anymore. The doctor came in and took my vitals. \u201cWow, you really are taking to the dialysis. We may get some regeneration out of this, my dear. You might not even need a transplant at this rate.\u201d</p><p>My dad had fallen asleep in the chair next to my bed, and Shane was passed out on the bed for parents.</p><p>I nodded at the doctor. \u201cThat\u2019s great news. How\u2019s Giselle?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHer liver will be here in about five hours and then, she too will be on the road to recovery. What a brutal experience you young ladies have had. I heard they caught him. Your science teacher, I heard?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, finding myself drawn to the doctor. He wasn\u2019t even attractive, but something about him was making me want to pull his face down onto mine.</p><p>I thought about the blood I had swapped with Dorian and sighed. I knew it must have been some side effect of his dirty blood. I didn\u2019t know Dorian, but he seemed to be a lady's man; it would figure for his blood to be some sort of aphrodisiac.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m running your blood again, and then I think we will do another ultrasound and X-ray. Then if things are looking up, we may do another biopsy.\u201d He wrote on his clipboard and walked out of the room.</p><p>Another biopsy? I hadn\u2019t realized they had done one already.</p><p>I was starting to feel like I was completely better, when Dorian walked back into the room quietly.</p><p>He looked menacing as he stood in my doorway. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cDo I have to leave my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, unless you want them dead too.\u201d</p><p>I frowned and wondered why he would threaten them. \u201cAre you going to hurt them?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not my gig, love; it might have been, but rules are rules. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to hurt them.\u201d</p><p>\"I would hurt them?\"</p><p>He nodded. \"Yes. You would kill them and love every second of it.\"</p><p>I gulped. \u201cHow do I leave without them becoming suspicious about me leaving?\u201d</p><p>He smirked ominously. \u201cLeave that little detail up to me.\u201d</p><p>\"I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m dead\u2014my dad can\u2019t take any more death.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey will think you\u2019re safe. Now we need to get going, so let me get this.\u201d</p><p>He appeared beside me and took my I.V. out and turned the machines off. He pulled the monitors off of me. His warm fingers brushed along my neckline and skin, touching more than necessary to remove the pads. He looked down on me as if I were a snack and raised one side of his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re very sexy, Aimee. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, mesmerized by his beautiful obsidian eyes.</p><p>He bent down very close to my face. I could very nearly taste the musk on his breath. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky girl that I need to get going or I would lock you away and savor a hundred years of alone time.\u201d His words made me weak. His black eyes made me even more frightened of him than I already was, which was a lot.</p><p>He turned away from me and walked to my dad. He touched his arm and woke him gently. \u201cMr. James, I need to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>I watched as my dad stirred slowly, finally waking up. He looked up at Dorian and frowned. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Dorian looked deeply into my dad's eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your daughter's specialist. We are transferring her to another hospital. She\u2019s going to be fine, but she needs to go and heal alone in this hospital. You need to go home and tell everyone she is going to be fine. She just needs some rest. The hospital is in California; it\u2019s a secret celebrity hospital.\u201d I rolled my eyes at Dorian and waited for my dad to laugh in his face.</p><p>My dad nodded like a zombie. \u201cOh, okay. That\u2019s great news. Thank you, doctor.\u201d</p><p>My chin hit the floor as Dorian closed my dad's eyes. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d My dad fell back into a deep sleep in his chair. Dorian's powers were scary; there was no doubt about it.</p><p>He turned around and held his arms out. \u201cSee, that\u2019s how it\u2019s done. So easy to mess with their tiny brains.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cMy dad's a genius.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNeat. Even with his brainpower, he doesn\u2019t stand a chance against me. Watch this one with the doctor.\u201d He smiled like a kid showing off his new toy. He stepped out of the room and into the hall, tapping my doctor on the shoulder as he was walking past. \u201cDoctor, I am a specialist from California. I am taking the lovely Miss James to my hospital, where she will recover. Tell everyone it\u2019s fine that she left with me. She is going somewhere to heal and be okay. Get rid of any records and fill in the blanks you need to so that no questions are asked. If anyone ever calls and asks about her, tell them you have received word she is doing better everyday.\u201d</p><p>The doctor nodded, as my dad had. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic. I will tell everyone.\u201d</p><p>Dorian laughed. \u201cGo jerk off in the supply cupboard, thinking about me.\u201d</p><p>The doctor walked away smiling a dirty smile.</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019re the devil, aren\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave me a serious look.

I\u2019m your only salvation.\u201d</p><p>\"Can you ever just be serious?\"</p><p>\"I'm always serious, Aimee.\"</p> <p>I shook my head and climbed off the bed. I walked to Shane. I bent down and inhaled the sea air on his skin and kissed his cheek. \u201cI love you, Shane.\u201d It was true. With the option of being with him removed from the table, I was devastated. I didn\u2019t know what to do except leave him a note. He had never lied to me, he had never wanted anything but to be with me, and he had never done anything but love me.</p><p>I wrote quickly,</p><p>\u201cShane,</p><p>I\u2019ve been taken to a special hospital that is offering me the best treatment. It\u2019s exactly what I need to heal. I am excited for you to join the police force and become a police officer. You\u2019re an amazing person and I will love you forever. No matter how this ends, know that I too have loved you since grade two.</p><p>I loved you when you started to bring an extra-huge lunch. Everyday you brought it to share with Nathan Anders. You knew he was poor and never had food, and you conned your mom into bigger lunches so you could feed him. You pretended she just packed big lunches and you couldn\u2019t eat it all.</p> <p>I loved you in grade eight, when you were riding your bike past my mom, and she had a flat tire, and you changed it. She had no clue how to do it. She told me you did it. You never told anyone that you had done it.</p><p>I loved you in eleventh grade, when the Smith girl got sick with cancer, and you started that change jar at your parents\u2019 store to raise money. It was to help pay for the medical bills. You acted like it was your parents\u2019 idea, but your mom told my mom it was your idea. I know you raised twenty-five thousand dollars for them and never even asked for recognition for the deed.</p><p>You\u2019re the most amazing man in the world and you will be the most amazing police officer. I can\u2019t wait to see it.</p><p>I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m strong enough.</p><p>Love always, and by that I mean\u2014I love you, Shane Bagley,</p><p>Aimee xoxo\u201d</p> <p>It broke my heart to write the letter. I folded it and put it in his pocket. He needed to know how I felt. I walked out of the hospital room, looking at my dad one last time. I left my cell phone on his lap and kissed his cheek. I didn\u2019t know what kind of danger I could become to my family. I felt like my heart was left in the room as I followed Dorian's darkness down the hall.</p><p>I stopped, only to look in on Giselle. She was asleep and completely yellow. I looked at Dorian for a moment and waited for him to answer the question burning in my eyes.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYeah, she\u2019ll be fine. She is very sexy. I might be back for her in about a year or so, when she is strong again. Mmmmm.\u201d He watched her sleeping, no doubt thinking all sorts of unsavory things.</p><p>I snapped my fingers in front of his face. \u201cHey, stop that. Does your brain function on any setting beyond sex?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me as if I were a bug he could squash and smirked.</p><p>He leaned in very close. \u201cNo, this is my only setting.\u201d He turned away from Giselle\u2019s room and walked down the hall to the big elevator doors. I walked behind him in my gown.</p><p>\u201cUhh, am I going to change?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI thought we covered this, yes.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned at him. \u201cClothes, idiot.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re sort of awful, aren\u2019t you? Not fun and flirty as I imagined when Aleks told me about you. Yes, my dear, I have this all worked out, so please stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>We got into the elevator and I thought about Aleks. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d I asked after a few moments.</p><p>Dorian shrugged, completely disinterested. \u201cTo cool off, I imagine. He\u2019s free now, so he will want to figure out the next step.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. \u201cYou freed him? From his curse? How?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou freed him, love. Not me. I enslaved him.\u201d</p><p>I stepped right into his face, well, chest and looked up at his face. He was a stone-cold killer, I knew it the second I looked into his eyes. I didn\u2019t flinch as I thought I would. I stood my ground. \u201cEnslaved him how? If you...\u201d</p><p>He pushed me roughly up against the wall of the elevator.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll what, little girl? Kill me?\u201d</p><p>He burst into laughter and bent down to my face. He kissed my neck, dragging his coarse whiskers across my sensitive skin. I tried to push him away, but I had nowhere near the strength to make an attempt at him. He ran his hands up my sides and pressed hard on my right side, making me wince.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do exactly as I ask. I have gone out on a huge limb for you, Aimee\u2014be grateful.\u201d</p><p>His cold gaze lifted to mine as he slid his hands up my breasts and into my hair. He pulled forcefully on the back of my head, causing me to cry out.</p><p>\u201cThis is our floor,\u201d he spoke, hovering above my face and then releasing me. He walked off the elevator calmly, as I stood shaking. I was scared of him in every way possible.</p><p>Why had Aleks left me to suffer at his hand? I knew I had offended him and had been horrid, but I had been frightened when Jaime died.</p><p>I started off the elevator when an idea hit me. I heard the elevator ding, and I stepped back on as the doors closed.</p><p>Dorian looked back at me in a panic as the gap in doors lessened. I pressed every button after three floors and decided I would get off at the first stop, three floors above us. I needed clothes. I was feeling stronger than I had in a year. I knew he could poof around the hospital and find me, but I hoped there were at least a few limitations to his abilities.</p><p>Panic filled me as I stepped off the elevator and looked around me. I saw I was on some kind of surgery floor. I walked along silently, looking behind me and in front of me in an alarmed state.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know where I was going, but I figured he would go back to my previous floor. I assumed I was on the fifth floor, which Giselle had been on previously. I walked looking sick and limping, in case I ran into someone. My heart raced as I looked everywhere for a plan or answer to my situation. I didn\u2019t know where to go. I knew I needed to stay away from my family. My only guess was that I would turn into Dorian. I would soon be a destructive force to be reckoned with. It scared me, not knowing what to expect. In the back of my mind, I knew Aleks would find me somehow. Whether I wanted to see him again or not.</p><p>I saw a door that looked ajar up ahead of me in the hall. Nervous of Dorian jumping out from behind the small slit in the open door and killing me, I pushed it open.</p><p>The room was a supply closet full of things I desperately needed. I stepped in and turned on the light as I closed the door. I peeked through the crack as I closed it. I didn\u2019t feel smarter than Dorian; he had more than likely been around since the dawn of time. I knew, however, that I was smarter than the average teenager, well, average adult too. He would underestimate me. Of that I was certain.</p><p>I changed into surgery scrubs, a mask, a cap, and booties. I tripled my booties, to appear as if I had shoes. I knew I would be walking in them and three booties were going to be better than one.</p><p>I sat down in the closet for a while, wondering if he could find me with a smell, or if he was able to pop to wherever I was. I was starving, but my stomach was starting to hurt in a funny way, as if I had food poisoning.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t run into my family without ruining Dorian's excuse as to where I was. I couldn\u2019t run into Shane without him dragging me back to the hospital bed. I definitely couldn\u2019t run into Dorian without him doing horrid things to me and possibly hurting me in ways I might never heal from. I shivered remembering his assault in the elevator. I slowly opened the door and peeked out into the quiet and empty hall.</p><p>I wondered what I would eat if I was a threat to Shane? I wondered if like Aleks, I would need regular food every now and then to be strong, or if like Dorian, I ate something else. I wasn\u2019t sure why I was certain Dorian didn\u2019t eat food. The black blood told me he was not exactly functioning inside quite the same way Aleks was. Truth be told though, I had never seen Aleks bleed. It was possible he was full of molasses as well.</p><p>I slipped out into the hall and ran down the emergency stairs to the bottom floor. I crept in the boiler room and ducked, looking around.</p><p>I saw a door in front of me about twenty yards away. There was steam blowing out of a vent of sorts, between the door and me. I felt my bravery coming to a head as I was nearly at the door. That would be the moment in a scary movie worth its salt, where the bad guy would show up. He would smash me in the head with one of the pipes in the room. My heart raced as I scared the ever-loving crap out of myself and made my way like a rat, scurrying to the door. I looked both ways as the safety of my wall had ended. I nearly dove out the door when I saw no one there.</p><p>The light from outside nearly blinded me as I made my way up the concrete staircase. I didn\u2019t know where I was, but the drizzle of the rain and cars parked all around me told me it could be the staff parking area. I ran from the building, not even looking. My feet pushed along the cement, driving me out into the parking lot.</p><p>I stopped running and began walking amongst the vehicles. I walked until I finally found an unlocked car and climbed inside of it. I sat and took a breather.</p><p>I needed to be as far away from there as I could get. I searched the car for money and found about twelve dollars in change. I found a pair of black ballet-styled flats a half a size smaller than I needed, but I squeezed my feet into them. I found a blue fleece, which obviously belonged to a woman a lot more rotund than me. I didn\u2019t care. I pulled it on over my scrubs to hide that at least. I felt guilty for stealing her things and imagined she loved the fleece. I wished I didn\u2019t need to take her stuff, but I knew it was life and death. I hoped if she had been there, she would have helped me under the circumstances. I locked her car for her; I felt it was the least I could do.</p><p>I walked along the cars, hoping to find at least one more of them open. It was tough going and security nearly saw me once, but I ducked behind a large SUV and hid for a while. I finally found another open car, which had thirty dollars in it and some granola bars in the dash. I stole a hair tie, ditched the cap and mask, and locked the car door. I ran from the parking lot into an alley around the corner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt vulnerable and scared, but I convinced myself that I just looked like a nurse getting off work. I walked hurriedly to the bus stop. I boarded the bus and finally started to breathe again. I never felt safe until I was crossing the center of the city, on my way out to the north. I had examined the bus when I boarded, but also when it came time for people to get off and on. I didn\u2019t see Dorian anywhere, but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t change into someone else. I trusted no one. I didn\u2019t know what he was capable of.</p><p>I watched out the window as my bus made its way to the main transit stop. There I could switch buses and board a bus for home. I didn\u2019t know what to do, but I knew that my best chance of survival was in a place I was comfortable in.</p><p>Even when I boarded the bus heading toward home, I was skeptical I would make it. I felt surrounded by him, even though I couldn\u2019t see him anywhere. When the forty-two dollars ran out, I found myself hours from home at a random bus stop. I locked myself in a bathroom stall, where I sat and ate my granola bar slowly. I didn\u2019t feel hungry, but I wasn\u2019t sure how I was getting home or when I would eat again.</p> <p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Am I a believer or a wanderer, does it matter?</p><p>According to Google Maps, a person can drive from the bus stop I was stranded at to my town in around three hours, and walk it in about two days. I, however, reacted rather well to Dorian's demon blood and was able to do it in one day. I shaved a bit of time off by running as much as I could. I rarely sweat. I never got hungry, and I didn\u2019t have to use the bathroom. My feet never really hurt, wearing shoes half a size too small, and I didn\u2019t need to sleep, not even a little. I didn\u2019t know what to say about that. I felt like one of the terminators. I walked past the sign for our town and felt a small sigh of relief.</p><p>Port Mackenzie was my safe haven in that crazy moment. I walked into town seeing the gas station and knew I would have to be very careful. Everyone in town knew me. I didn\u2019t know where to go, but decided my own house would be a great place to start.</p><p>I crept along backyards and kept my head down until finally reaching our street. I snuck through the backyards of my neighbors until I reached our fence. I climbed over it, again surprised by the strength I seemed to be able to muster. I climbed up and over with little or no problems. I landed in the backyard just as the sky turned dark. Our house was black.</p> <p>I wondered where my sister was, where my dad was, and mostly, where Dorian was.</p><p>Would he sit in my house and wait for me to come home?</p><p>Did he know where I lived?</p><p>Would he have held my dad and Shane hostage until I came to them?</p><p>Would he tell them what I had become?</p><p>Would they be dangling from a bridge somewhere, expecting me to save them with my new super strength?</p> <p>I moved stealthily across the grass to the back door where the hidden key was. I unlocked it and crept inside. I didn\u2019t turn any lights on. I stood there and smelled the air for a second. I was home. My heart was racing, but I couldn\u2019t help but enjoy the moment.</p><p>I grabbed a drink of water, not realizing I was desperately thirsty. I gulped back three huge glasses and instantly had to pee. I ran to the toilet, assuming it was what life was like for Aleks, doing what he needed when he got the chance. I flushed and ran upstairs to my room. I opened the bag with my mom\u2019s nightgown and took deep breaths. I savored the smell and then put the bag back; I would be back for it.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I whispered, looking around, and wished Aleks would show up. Then I could get the answers I needed about my mom's death.</p><p>I cursed Dorian under my breath.</p><p>I grabbed a crayon from my art set and opened the window to my bedroom. In light yellow crayon, I wrote on the outside windowpane. \u2018I need to see you. Come find me! Check at the beach.\u2019</p><p>I knew he would see it and know I needed him. I grabbed two changes of my usual black clothes and stuffed them into my beach backpack. I put in a few key items I knew no one would know were missing. I jumped into the shower and rinsed myself in the dark, not turning any lights on. It was, by far, the scariest shower I'd ever had. I was clean, dressed, and ready to go fifteen minutes from arriving home.</p><p>I grabbed the ball cap my Gran had bought me a few summers before and stuffed it on my head. I tucked my long hair through the back and made a ponytail.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to do or where to go when I slipped out the back door. I locked the house and ran out to the back fence. Night had fully set in and enveloped the world in black. I was grateful for the moonless night, running through the woods at the back of our property. I ran until I reached Shane\u2019s house.</p> <p>His truck was there, but that meant nothing. My dad had taken his truck to Portland with Shane. I slipped in around the back of the house. Shane\u2019s house was as dark as my own. Frustrated, I didn\u2019t know what to do. My energy levels were high and I was feeling fine, but how long did I have? I didn\u2019t feel the change yet. I didn\u2019t know anything.</p><p>I looked at the forest that Shane had carried me from many times and shook my head. It had only been a few days since I was on my deathbed, and there I was, feeling stronger than I ever had and yet still dying. Or was I? I wondered if maybe my body reacted badly to the demon blood, and instead of immortality, I just healed and got strong. Maybe I would be fine and could just go on with my regular life. I wondered if God just felt sorry for me for all the shitty things that had happened, and he was giving me a mulligan.</p><p>I sat down on the back steps of his deck, pondering life and choices. I looked back at the grass and vaguely remembered how it had felt to lay with Shane under the stars, and the way he had looked at me. I still loved him. No matter what had ever happened with Aleks, I couldn\u2019t get him out of my mind or heart. The distance from Aleks seemed to allow me the clarity of realizing the lust I felt, as opposed to the love. He seemed to have that effect on all women.</p><p>I heard a vehicle pull in as men\u2019s voices started to speak and car doors closed and opened.</p><p>I paused, listening.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, thank you, Shane. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine. Like I said, the doctor seemed to be convinced she needed to go there.\u201d</p><p>My dad's voice filled the yard. I stopped breathing, realizing I had nowhere I could run except the stalker woods, but they scared the life out of me. I sat very still, hoping I would have a few seconds at least to hide.</p><p>\u201cI know, Mr. James. I\u2019m really bummed about it. I just can\u2019t believe I never got to say goodbye.\u201d Shane\u2019s voice was full of emotion; he sounded crushed.</p><p>\u201cShe knows you love her, kiddo. Good luck on your test, son, and if I hear from her, I will call you right away.\u201d My dad used my nickname on him. It warmed and broke my heart simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cThanks, sir. Have a good sleep,\u201d Shane called out. I heard his front door close and I jumped up and ran around the side of the house where the garage was. I froze, hearing him inside the house and then opening the back deck door.</p><p>\u201cHello, are you there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked back, not moving, not breathing. How did he know I was there?</p><p>\u201cOh okay, yeah. My cell does that too.\u201d He laughed. I breathed a sigh of relief, still not moving as he talked on the phone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I need to know where in California is the clinic that does celebrity liver treatments. A friend of mine is there and I just want to know the name of it. Thanks. Yeah, just call this number and leave a message, if I\u2019m not here. Thanks, man. I need to find her.\u201d</p><p>He was one corner of the house away from me. I crept along the side to the front of the house and stood in front of the garage, breathing heavily.</p><p>Dorian hadn\u2019t been prepared for how much Shane loved me. Shane wouldn\u2019t stop until he found me. My heart broke. What had I done?</p><p>I wondered about just revealing myself to Shane and letting the cards fall where they may. The only problem was that I wasn\u2019t sure what I would become, and I didn\u2019t want him getting hurt.</p><p>A small part of me wondered if he would still want me or love me if he knew I was changing in a supernatural way. I wondered if he would just end things between us. I didn\u2019t want to push the envelope. I decided to leave his yard and find somewhere else to haunt.</p><p>I walked for a long time. I kept my head down as cars drove past me. I walked, thinking about the way things had played out.</p><p>I stopped for a moment at the fork in a road and thought about which way to turn. I was homeless.</p><p>I knew which way I wanted to go.</p><p>I turned, walking carefully as I approached his driveway. I rounded the corner of the house and opened the door to the garage with the lock code. I slipped through the garage into the hallway. I walked, not making any noise until I reached the stairs to the basement. Then I crept down them very slowly.</p><p>I could see the faint glow of the computer screen flashing from the far corner, where I knew he sat playing World of Warcraft. I snuck along, not wanting to scare him or wake his parents, if they were even home. Blake\u2019s parents were lucky he was a calm kid. With the amount of free time he had, he could have been doing all kinds of unsavory things without any hindrances.</p><p>He sat hunched over the game, with headphones on, chatting. I couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying. I plopped myself down on his leather couch and watched him for a minute.</p><p>He must have gotten the eerie feeling someone was watching him. He sat very still for a second and then turned his face slowly. Seeing me sitting on his couch, he smiled. \u201cHey.\u201d He went back to his game instantly, not registering that I shouldn\u2019t be in his house.</p><p>Stopping again after a second, he froze. He looked scared to move as if I might be a ghost coming to say my goodbye to him. I could tell he was nervous as he turned again, peeking at me.</p><p>I waved at him. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but it wasn\u2019t the peaceful one he had given moments before. Instead, it was a tense smile, which made me laugh. \u201cAimes?\u201d he spoke carefully, not getting up from the chair.</p><p>I nodded, wanting to cry with relief. He removed his headphones and looked at me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and chewed my lower lip. I couldn\u2019t hold back the dam of emotions. It burst free and I lost control of myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rushed to my side holding me. \u201cDid someone hurt you, Aimes?\u201d</p><p>He wrapped around me, squeezing the life out of me. I let him cocoon around me and make me feel a sense of safety, even if it was fleeting. Even his love couldn\u2019t save me from what was coming.</p><p>I cried in sheets, like the cold coastal rain.</p> <p>It poured out in sobs and heaves.</p><p>I had lost it.</p><p>His shirt was getting soaked where I cried and left different forms of my bodily fluids on it. I started laughing, finding it funny that I had thoroughly snotted his shirt.</p><p>He pulled me back, and his eyes were intense. \u201cDid someone hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSort of, but I did it to myself.\u201d</p> <p>I wiped my eyes dry with my sleeves as he passed me a tissue. He took an extra one for himself and began wiping his shoulder. He looked horrified at the wet mark.</p><p>I laughed harder, unable to control myself.</p><p>He frowned at me. \u201cI\u2019m glad you find it so amusing that you\u2019ve left nasal secretions on my shoulder, dear God.\u201d</p><p>His fussing over the shirt made me laugh more. I couldn\u2019t look at him without being sent into a fit of giggles again. I turned away from him for a moment and straightened my face and waited for the fit to pass by.</p><p>He left the couch and sat across from me on the other leather couch.</p><p>I looked at him gravely when I finally found my calm.</p> <p>\u201cSomething terrible has happened and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m putting you in terrible danger coming here, but I don\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAimes, whatever is going on, we will find a rational and sensible solution. I\u2019m still your best friend, even if I haven\u2019t acted much like one.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI haven\u2019t either, Blake, and I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t care who you date. I was being petty.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI should have told you the truth years ago. I thought, honestly, that you knew. I\u2019ve been head over heels for that twit forever.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, not smiling.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bring myself to smile. I dreaded what was about to happen. I knew the possibilities that he would either commit me or kick me out lingered in the air as I started to speak.</p><p>\u201cRemember when you asked me to just listen and hear the whole story, before I slapped you and walked away?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking confused.</p> <p>\u201cI need that same favor. But I need you to act like an adult, not the child I acted like. Is that possible?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, sitting back on the couch getting comfy.</p><p>My stomach twisted and turned as my nerves prepared the rest of me for the worst-case scenario.</p><p>I took a deep breath and started. I watched as his brain was translating and diagnosing me as I spoke.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t understand what I was saying and couldn\u2019t imagine any of it would ever be real. He had a scientific reason for everything I said. I ignored his looks and continued speaking until I got to the very end of the story, which landed me on his couch, crying and homeless.</p><p>Blake sat there, looking very lost at the end of the story.</p><p>I looked at him, pleading with him. \u201cBlake, I want you to think about who is telling you this. Look at me. Have I ever given you cause to not trust something I was telling you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly. \u201cWhat are you becoming?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have an answer. I shrugged, still watching him take it all in.</p><p>\u201cYou ran from the bus stop at Miller\u2019s Crossing all the way here in a day?\u201d His voice was empty, no accusation or feeling.</p><p>I nodded, wanting him to believe me, so that I could finally rest a bit. I wasn\u2019t tired in the regular sense, but I was tired of not feeling safe.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, I am going to go with you on this one, until I can either disprove or solve it.\u201d</p><p>My eyes lit up. \u201cI can stay here with you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you stay here with me? You thought I would kick you out because you drank alien blood from that guy and don\u2019t require sleep or food anymore?\u201d</p><p>I nodded as he got up from the couch and grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cI need sleep and I suggest you try too.\u201d</p><p>I let him drag me to his room. We climbed on top of his bed. He turned the lights out and lay beside me on the bed.</p><p>\u201cHow are things with Alise?\u201d I asked, tired of my ridiculous life.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOh man, your sister is crazy. I have no idea what to do with her. It\u2019s like having a two-year-old around, and you know how I feel about other people's children in my house. She touches things and breaks them. She has to be doing something at every second of every day. I seriously think she might need Ritalin or something.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing.</p><p>He turned to look at me with a serious face. \u201cAimee, I\u2019m not kidding. She broke my vintage Luke Skywalker. It was still in the box, and she took it out and broke it. She said it was an accident, but I think she misbehaves on purpose to start fights with me.\u201d</p><p>He had hit the nail on the head. I chuckled, feeling sorry for him.</p><p>\u201cYou can't choose who you love; I\u2019m a prime example of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love him, Aimes, even after he left you in the hospital, lied to you about what he did for a living, and let Jaime die?\u201d Blake\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t cruel; he truly was curious.</p><p>I felt close to tears as I spoke, \u201cWhen I\u2019m with Shane, I feel so in love with him, but when I\u2019m with Aleks, I feel in love with him too. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAimes, love is supposed to lift you up, not bring you down. If you are obsessively in love with this guy, then you need to end it. No relationship that\u2019s healthy puts the other person above you. The relationship that ends all of the good things in your life is the wrong relationship. You\u2019re choosing the wrong guy if you love Aleks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you, Mr. Love Guru.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI saw it on Dr. Phil.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cI do love Aleks, but not as much as I love Shane. I wish I didn\u2019t love Aleks at all. I truly think that if he\u2019d never come along, I would have found my way to Shane naturally. I would be happy right now, instead of dying alone.\u201d</p><p>Blake pulled me onto his chest and kissed the top of my head. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be alone, Aimes, not ever. Besides, you can see ghosts now; you're good.\u201d</p><p>I whacked him in the gut and snuggled into his armpit.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Giselle?\u201d I asked, scared to hear the answer.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great, as far as I know. Her body has accepted the liver with no problems. Alise said your dad was there again today to see her. I guess he and Shane stayed in the city a few days. She\u2019s doing amazing. Your dad doesn\u2019t even worry about you though. He believes that lie about you being at the celebrity liver clinic. I knew it was bullshit the minute your sister told me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I couldn\u2019t believe that weirdo was able to trick my dad. Of all of the people in the world I would not call gullible. He bought it though\u2014it was strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was scared you were dead or something and that he just couldn\u2019t cope with it.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him tighter. \u201cI would have haunted you a little, so you would have known.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah, I expect you to haunt me when you die.\u201d</p><p>I felt so happy for Giselle. If anyone deserved a happy ending in all of this nonsense, it was her.</p><p>I fell asleep quickly.</p><p>I woke many hours later to an empty room and daylight streaming through the huge windows.</p><p>The room was warm. I felt re-energized and invigorated. I didn\u2019t know how to respond to waking without the feeling of wanting to go back to sleep. It had been so long since I\u2019d been healthy and not depressed. Sleep had been my companion over the course of the last ten months.</p><p>Blake was gone, which worried me. I climbed out of his bed and walked to the family room, hoping I would find him at the computer.</p><p>He was nowhere to be found in the basement. I climbed the stairs, hoping his parents were still in the city, or at the very least, on a vacation somewhere. I didn\u2019t think I could face his chipper and perky mom, not after everything I'd been through.</p><p>Blake\u2019s house was completely empty. I searched every room, starting to feel panicked. I sat on the peach leather couch in the front room. I watched out the front window for him to come home with my sister, dad, Shane, or worse. I assumed he had panicked when he woke and ran from the house, thinking me either crazed or drugged out.</p><p>I sat there for a long time, not moving. I noticed my lack of need to move. I wasn\u2019t restless or fidgeting; I wasn\u2019t feeling the need to change positions. I barely needed to breathe. I held my breath just to see how long I could go for. I started to feel weird about not breathing, but not desperate for air. When I breathed I felt better, but it wasn\u2019t as if I couldn\u2019t have made it another twenty minutes without the breath. I decided to test it out and walked to the backyard. I stripped down to my underwear and tank top. I jumped into the cool crisp pool and let out all of the air in my lungs. I sank like a stone to the bottom of the deep end of the pool. I sat and waited for desperation and panic to set in. Nothing happened, so I waited some more.</p><p>I saw a dark figure at the edge of the pool and felt my stomach fill with nerves. I pushed myself up to see Blake\u2019s frowning face.</p><p>\u201cYou were down there for seven minutes.\u201d He didn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>I frowned at him. \u201cI thought you were Dorian, not cool. I could have gone longer. Were you spying on me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI wanted to see what you would do when you were alone. I watched you hold your breath on the couch. This is crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He sat at the edge of the pool and hiked up his pants. He dipped his feet into the pool and cringed at the cold. \u201cMy dad hasn\u2019t turned the heat on yet. This weekend, he said. It's fifty degrees, Aimes, fifty. The chemicals were just balanced yesterday in preparation for summer.\u201d He pulled his legs out after a couple seconds.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel cold to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked worried. \u201cWhat if this is a nervous disorder and you\u2019re hurting yourself, but you just can\u2019t feel it\u2014like an after effect from the drugs.\u201d</p><p>I swam to the edge nervously. What if I injured my body and was stuck for all eternity with a deformed body? I climbed out of the pool, using no effort to lift myself up and out.</p><p>Blake raised his eyebrows at that. \u201cNot so feeble, huh?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled. \u201cOne benefit so far is that I\u2019m stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant something to eat?\u201d he asked, handing me one of the lush pool towels. I had always laughed at how his pool towels were nicer than most people\u2019s 'good' towels that you weren\u2019t even allowed to use. I wrapped the towel around me and followed him into the house.</p><p>\u201cHow long was I sleeping?\u201d I asked as I sat at the bar like always, waiting for him to feed me.</p><p>He looked puzzled. \u201cTwelve and half hours. You slept like the dead too, because I tried to wake you up and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I breathe?\u201d I asked, feeling pretty worried.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNope, not really, and none of the usual snoring either. Waffles or grilled cheese?\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him and crossed my arms. He shrugged and made me grilled cheese.</p><p>I had slept at Blake\u2019s house for five nights, hanging in his basement playing World of Warcraft and watching TV. Everyday he went to school and hung out with my sister.</p><p>In his free time, he spent every minute trying to solve my issues.</p><p>Drug-induced brain tumor was in the lead for things that could be wrong with me. I let him believe I had imagined it all, but my heart knew Aleks was real. I wondered where he was. I never left the safety of the basement, even for food. Blake brought it to me on a regular schedule, believing I would end up hurting myself by only eating when I needed to. The food filled me up but something inside me was still hungry. I felt a thirst or a hunger I couldn\u2019t explain. The thirst grew whenever Blake was around, but I had been able to control it.</p><p>Blake had gone out again. I was lying on his bed, not sure of what to do with all of my free time, when I felt it.</p> <p>Someone was watching me. My stomach twisted.</p><p>Scared it was Dorian, but hopeful it was Aleks, I looked around the room.</p><p>Instead of Dorian or Aleks, Shane stood in the entrance to the room. He looked at me with a burning intense pain in his eyes. He looked weak and sick. I sprang off the bed and grabbed him.</p><p>As if he needed to touch me too, I was off the ground and dragged up into his arms. He wrapped me around him and held me like a child. His body trembled. I wrapped my legs around him and buried my face into his shoulder. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I owed him an apology. I honestly didn\u2019t think I would do it justice.</p><p>I made the attempt anyway. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Shane. I didn\u2019t mean to leave. I just didn\u2019t have any choice. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you like that.\u201d</p><p>He never spoke. He just carried me to Blake\u2019s bed. I shook my head. \"The spare room is down the hall. We can talk in there.\u201d He obeyed, still not speaking, and carried me down the hall.</p><p>He sat me on the bed and knelt on the floor in front of me. He held me tightly to him. \u201cAimee, I don't understand why you left? Why did you trust Blake and not me with your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>I cuddled into him, trying desperately to pull him on to the bed with me.</p><p>He stood and closed the door. He walked toward me and picked me up again. He laid me down on the bed, back where the pillows were. His mouth crushed mine with a kiss so forceful I could barely keep up with him. His hands went up my fleece, tearing the shirt right from my body. I shivered, mostly from anticipation. He sat up for a second and looked down on me. I tried to cover myself. He smiled the most dangerous smile I had ever seen cross his lips. He ripped his shirt off, revealing his soft, firm muscled body. I ran my hands along his ribs and chest when he lay back down. His skin felt just as I imagined it would, warm and strong. His mouth caressed mine. His hands roamed my arms down to my stomach. He rolled on his back and pulled me on top of him. I loved the feeling of his soft skin against mine, with his huge hands roaming my back, pulling me into him. I felt his need and answered with my own. I gulped when he undid my pants. My stomach freaked out. I knew it was what I wanted, but I was terrified.</p><p>The hunger to be with him seemed to be outweighing the hunger I couldn\u2019t quite describe. Something about all his naked skin against mine was filling the void.</p><p>\"Aimee,\" he whispered, kissing my throat.</p><p>\"I'm glad you came.\"</p><p>\"I love you, Aimee.\"</p><p>\"I love you too.\"</p><p>His mouth roamed my neck, sending shivers up my spine. His hands slowly made their way up my stomach to my breasts. He cupped them both, massaging. He lifted his face to my nipples, and I moaned loudly in pleasure, not thinking about who else was in the house.</p><p>I dragged my hands down his torso. His body was hard but soft at the same time. He rolled me over and climbed between my thighs. Anxiety and excitement built inside of me. His deep-blue eyes seared mine.</p><p>I could feel his erection pressed against me when his lips caressed mine again. We both pulled off our remaining clothes in a heated frenzy.</p><p>He rested against me again, almost hesitating. His eyes met mine once more, as if checking with me. I nodded. I could feel my heartbeat exploding in my chest. He bent, kissing my lips, and slid against me, sending chills every which way. I took a deep breath when he entered me, filling me with warmth.</p><p>He moved slowly; I knew he was making sure I wasn\u2019t hurting. The initial pain was gone, and in its stead, I felt something building low in my stomach. He moved slowly, methodically. The feeling of his hardness inside of me was intense. I felt my fingers clutching him. Pulling at his skin. My breath was crashing upon his shoulders. When his breath matched mine, he began moving faster. I couldn\u2019t focus on anything. I felt my body wrap around him, enjoying the feel of his thick body. I was holding him to me everywhere.</p><p>I felt myself get lost in everything as pleasure filled every inch of my body.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>That was amazing and then it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The perma-grin that plastered my face was ridiculous; I looked like The Joker. I felt my red hot cheeks flashing, \u201cHey, I just lost my V-Card.\"</p><p>I glanced over at him and frowned. \"Shane?\"</p><p>He was still unconscious. I'd heard men always fell asleep right after, but this was ridiculous. He literally came and fell asleep. I poked him. He moaned and rolled over to look at me. He smiled sleepily.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\"</p><p>He shook his head and moaned. \"No. Aimes, you almost killed me.\" His grin was delicious. He closed his eyes, and I jumped out of the bed, running for the shower. I hoped the hot water in the shower would bring me back down to earth. I was happy, but I felt weird. It wasn\u2019t that I hadn\u2019t wanted it. It was that I was scared I was still changing into something not good, and this was just distracting me from my predicament.</p><p>I soaped up as the shower door opened. I covered myself when he walked in, taking all of the room and hot water with him. I sighed looking at him, obviously only from the belly button up. I may have had sex with him, but I was still the innocent, na\u00efve girl I had been only hours before. I looked up at his face, blushing harder and smiling even goofier.</p><p>He frowned at me as he kissed me. \u201cI'm so sleepy.\"</p><p>\"Is that normal?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, but not this sleepy. I think I was just so tired and stressed.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" My grin wasn\u2019t fading.</p><p>\"What?\u201d He looked at my dorky smile and arched an eyebrow.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cOh nothing. Just feels weird you being in my shower, seeing me naked with the lights on\u2014you know, that sort of stuff.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWe just had s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSTOP!\u201d I put a hand up to his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. Let\u2019s talk about other stuff.\u201d</p><p>I had stopped soaping and was rinsing with what little water I got off of him. He laughed, taking my hand away and kissing me slowly, sensually.</p><p>Realizing he was taking all of the water, he moved around me, pushing me into the water. It splashed down onto my face before I realized what was happening. I sputtered as I backed up into him.</p><p>It was not my idea of a shower. I wanted to wash my nether regions, which I couldn\u2019t do with him in the shower.</p><p>I gave up on trying to get clean and hoped to do a quick mini scrub of the area after he got out.</p><p>His face got serious. \u201cAimee, where have you been?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I gulped. I knew it was going to have to be talked about at some point. His eyes filled with fear.</p><p>He stepped close to me again, sucking up all of the hot water and pinning me against the cool tiled wall. \u201cYou\u2019re the only thing that makes me feel like the person I want to be. I need you. Without you, I have a hole in my chest. I've been going crazy for days.\u201d I could see the truth in his eyes; he needed me. I felt the same.</p><p>\u201cI need you too. I had to run away from this guy Dorian. He...well, he was mean to me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to tell him about Dorian assaulting me in the elevator. It was a fight he would never win, and he would feel like he needed to defend my honor.</p><p>His face stormed over into a dark and sinister expression. \u201cWho the hell is this Dorian? When did he try to hurt you? Does he work in the hospital? I'll kill him, Aimes.\u201d</p><p>I gulped. \u201cOh, sorry. I thought Blake told you the whole story. He's a demon of some sort, which I know sounds crazy, but he is. You just have to believe me. He tried to scare me, I think. It worked and I ran away.\u201d</p><p>His face looked a bit scary as he spoke, \u201cBlake told me what you believed happened. He seems pretty sure it\u2019s a brain tumor. We need to get you some help, Aimes.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cBlake is crazy\u2014brain tumor. No, Dorian made me swap blood with him. It was gross. It healed me. I went from deathbed to fully healed in like half an hour. He said I would change and be dangerous to you, my dad, and everyone. Nothing has happened since though. I\u2019ve had some bad stomach aches but that\u2019s about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shane looked confused. \u201cYou honestly believe this?\u201d</p><p>\"I don\u2019t know what I believe.

He didn\u2019t look like he believed me, but he wasn\u2019t giving me the same look Blake was.</p><p>He smiled, but something about his eyes worried me. \u201cGet out of the shower and meet me in the guest room.\u201d</p> <p>He bent and kissed me, tracing his lips over mine as he left the shower. My stomach leapt at the thought of going back into the guest room.</p><p>I quickly washed the things I hadn\u2019t been able to and jumped out when he left the bathroom. I wrapped myself in a towel and made my way, slinking through the basement into the guest room.</p><p>Blake was apparently not home yet.

He rubbed his hands up my arms. \u201cI love you, Aimee James. I love you so much. Please, don\u2019t leave me again.\u201d</p><p>He bent and kissed me.</p><p>I sat on the bed in my towel, waiting until he was gone to change.</p> <p>\u201cBe fast.\u201d He kissed my forehead and walked from the room. My face was on fire, thinking about what we had done. I grabbed the blanket we hadn\u2019t touched and rolled myself in it like a cocoon.</p><p>As I lay there, the room started to spin. My stomachache, which I hadn\u2019t noticed since Shane had come, was finding it way up into my chest.</p><p>I slipped out of the sheets, trying desperately to ignore the pain in my chest. I would need to clean the sheets if I was going to leave and stay with Shane. I threw on my clothes quickly and started on the guest bed.</p><p>\u201cUh, why are you washing the guest room sheets?\u201d Blake\u2019s voice made me jump.</p><p>I turned to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m heading to Shane\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, looking at my red face and raised an eyebrow inquisitively. \u201cWant to tell me something, Aimes? Did Shane come over?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cNo. What?\u201d My tone raised an octave.</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cWhy are you blushing like that? You look super guilty. Did you break something?\u201d He looked around panicking, making me laugh.</p> <p>I shook my head. \"I'm not Alise, dude.\" I closed the washing machine on my sheets and walked out of the laundry room.</p><p>\u201cYour sister is getting suspicious as to why I can\u2019t have her over right now while my parents are away.\"</p><p>\"You can. I'm leaving.\"</p><p>\"So why are you washing the sheets to the guest room you haven\u2019t even slept in if you're leaving?\u201d</p><p>He closed the laundry room door and slumped onto the couch with one leg up on the back of it. He was sprawled out, looking up at the ceiling. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be leaving.\"</p><p>I laughed and sat on the couch across from him. \u201cWhy?\"</p><p>He smirked, still looking at the ceiling. \u201cBecause you still need to tell me who you had sex with in my guest room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had any sex. I was seriously just cleaning the sheets, \u2018cause I want them fresh, you know. I like the smell of fresh sheets.\u201d My excuse made no sense. He looked amused.</p><p>\u201cI found this though, and I\u2019m pretty sure it isn\u2019t mine or my dad\u2019s.\u201d He pulled a white undershirt out of the couch cushions. I frowned at him, puzzled. It was Shane\u2019s undershirt. I wanted to grab it and smell it, but I resisted. I knew my eyes had already revealed more than enough with my surprised look.</p><p>\u201cI stashed it when I heard you in the laundry room. I saw the bed all rumpled and ripped apart. It was on the floor of the guest room. Now spill the beans or I\u2019m phoning Shane and asking why you couldn\u2019t just do it at his house.\u201d He joked, but I knew he was enough of a pest that he would do it.</p><p>I dropped my face into my hands, ashamed. \u201cOkay\u2014God! I lost my virginity in your guest bed. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cThrow the sheets out, Aimee. Damn, we aren\u2019t hard up for sheets around here. My mom has a whole closet with just sheets in it. Where is Shane, anyway?\u201d</p><p>I felt even worse and groaned into my hands. \u201cThe sheets are fine; I\u2019m washing them to be polite. Shane went home.\u201d</p><p>He sat up. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>I shivered. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s fine? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the guardian angel and the death prophecy?\u201d He seemed more sarcastic than usual, but of course Blake didn\u2019t believe Aleksander was real. He was part of my drug-induced brain tumor.</p><p>I looked up, meeting his worried face. \u201cThe magical guardian angel and I are done.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed with recognition, as he recalled that part of the story. \u201cBut the demon with molasses blood did say you were a danger to other people?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He grimaced again. \u201cWhy did Shane leave? Is he hurt?\u201d</p><p>I threw the couch cushion at him. \u201cHe was weirded out by what happened in your guest room, hamtard.\u201d</p><p>Blake shook his head, disgusted with me. \u201cI can't say I blame him; really could have happened at his house, dude.\u201d</p><p>Sheepishly, I nodded. \u201cI know. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope you don\u2019t mind that I told him what you told me, or that you were here.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cSee the reason I did is, uh, well we think you need medical help. I'm kinda sickened Shane had sex with you. He agrees with me that you need psychiatric help.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shot up at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d That had come up out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cWe just think that there is seriously something wrong with you, medically, and this brain tumor or whatever is wrong with you needs to be checked out. You\u2019re delusional. One minute you\u2019re soooo in love with some guardian angel, and then the next, it\u2019s Shane. Then some demon makes you drink his black blood and you\u2019re all better. Come on, Aimee. Listen to yourself for one minute.\u201d</p><p>I was lost. He was my best friend in the entire world and he wanted to lock me up.</p><p>Shane had agreed with him.</p><p>I was alone.</p><p>Blake\u2019s face hardened. I had never seen his face grow so cold. \"You have to go with me. I promise I won\u2019t let them hurt you. Psychiatry has come a long way. This is for the best.\"</p><p>I looked down. \"I'm not coming with you. I'm not going to an institute.\"</p><p>He sighed, rubbing his hands over his face. \u201cAimee, come on. Be reasonable.\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Then I think you need to leave. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t help you anymore. I\u2019ll keep your secret but that\u2019s it. If you\u2019re sick and won't let me help you, then I can't have you here hiding out. I can\u2019t keep this from your dad and Alise anymore. I\u2019m part of the family now.\u201d</p><p>I was in agony. I pressed my lips together and stood up from his couch. I picked my fleece off of the back of the computer chair and walked up the stairs to sneak out of his house, the way I had come in. I was ashamed of everyone I knew.</p><p>\"Aimee, I'll take you back to the hospital. If you'll come, I'm sure that they'll find what's wrong,\" he called after me, but I ignored him.</p><p>I had been abandoned.</p><p>How could Shane agree with him?</p><p>How could Shane think that I needed to be committed and still have sex with me?</p><p>When I got out of the garage door, I ran. I ran as fast as I could, until I reached the old highway where our secret beach was. I ran down the old road to the trail. When I crossed the road into the thick forest, I savored the cool air I got when I entered the trees. I didn\u2019t feel afraid of the forest, which I wished had been from feeling invincible, but unfortunately was from a lack of care. If I died, I wouldn't care.</p><p>I ran along the trail, barely seeing the greenery and trees as I made my way to the ocean. I could smell the salt and seaweed when I approached where the forest cleared and the trail ended. I ran down to the beach, still feeling angry with Blake and Shane.</p><p>I walked along the small part of the sandy beach, enjoying the feel of the sand under my sneakers. Slowly, it turned to rocks, the usual West Coast beach. The rocks got bigger, and it became more difficult to walk along.</p><p>I smiled, looking at a huge rock, and remembered my sister helping me to lift the rocks that were much too large for one small child. We poked at the crabs with sticks gently until they clamped a pincher on a stick. Then we would run around with the stick and the crab. I couldn\u2019t help but shake my head, remembering the terrified crabs as we each ran up and down the beach. No amount of running would make them let go; they hung on until their little crab feet touched ground again.</p><p>I wished I had that ability to hang onto something with all of the force and strength I had. I wished I were able to stay on my stick, no matter the amount of turmoil I was put through. Instead, I sat on some driftwood far down the beach and looked out at the grey, choppy waters. I had nowhere else to go. I wasn\u2019t completely cold, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable. I missed Blake\u2019s house. I contemplated if the shoe were on the other foot, if I would have tolerated this sort of madness from him. I knew the answer. He had made the right choice. I thought about Shane and imagined him walking up the beach with open arms, ready to believe my crazy story, knowing we loved each other.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Cabin fever without a cabin is called insanity.</p><p>I didn\u2019t sleep, and out of desperation, I made a small campfire on the beach the old-fashioned way. Rubbing dry sticks together did produce a fire. It was lucky my muscles never cramped, because it had taken me forever to get a spark with the damp wood.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to expect with the changes, but I definitely expected more than the odd stomachache or random sweat. I started to wonder if I was ever going to change, or if that was it. I was stronger, faster, required very little to survive, and didn\u2019t need a lot of sleep. I was like a super being but without anything cool. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My college years would be very cost effective at this rate. One meal a week and with no sleep required, my grades would never take that initial dip everyone experienced.</p><p>I decided that if after three days nothing was different, I would go home. I would tell my dad that I was cured and finish my school year on time.</p><p>Counting down three days was a tough way to think about life. I had nothing to do in my spare time but think. I walked the beach in both directions. I found neat tidal pools that contained all sorts of sea life. I swam in the ocean, made fires, and even built a small log cabin. That had taken most of the first day, but I wasn\u2019t a patient person anymore\u2014I felt restless.</p> <p>I thought about Shane; I thought about him non-stop. My heart deceived my mind and ignored the fact he had betrayed me.</p><p>I thought about him nonstop, regardless.</p><p>A couple with a small child, more than likely from Port Handley as I didn\u2019t recognize them, walked the beach the morning of day two. They greeted me cautiously. I noticed I could smell them. Something about them made me want to touch them. I stayed on my side of the beach to be careful. I wasn\u2019t sure of anything about myself and I didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone.</p><p>I watched them walk away from me, but I couldn\u2019t help but fantasize about touching their arms, holding them close to me. I frightened myself with my quirky thoughts. I thought about Aleks and the conversation we needed to have. I tried to distract myself. It might have worked if every thought hadn\u2019t turned to Shane, which in turn twisted into a memory about having S.E.X. with Shane.</p><p>I was going stir crazy, thinking about him touching me. I wanted him. I wanted to touch him, but mostly, I wanted to do it all again. I was having feelings I couldn\u2019t explain.</p> <p>At first I thought they were ordinary sex thoughts that a person would have after doing it for the first time. Then I realized that I was obsessing. I felt more like a teenage boy than a prudish girl.</p><p>I felt the warm wind off the fire and tricked myself into believing Aleks was back, but it had been from a breeze off the sea.</p><p>I had driven myself nutty long enough and decided to bail on my plan of three days. I started to extinguish the fire by spreading out the logs of wood, breaking apart the remnants with my shoe. I used a large seashell I had found and grabbed water from one of the tidal pools. I started to pour water on the fire when I saw movement behind me.</p><p>I turned to see Shane sitting on the log where I had been. I wanted to run to him, but I stayed very still. I put the seashell down and waited for him to talk.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak. He just sat, staring at the fire struggling to remain lit as if not realizing I was there. His face looked devastated.</p><p>I walked toward him, lost in the fear I had imagined him.</p> <p>\u201cShane, are you really there?\u201d I asked him, feeling terrified he was dead like Jaime had been.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, Aimee, I am. I waited for you, but you never came. Again, you left me. I was pissed, and I went to Blake's. He told me everything he said.\u201d</p><p>I felt anger inside of me brewing. I wanted to kill Blake. It felt like my anger was exaggerated.</p><p>He lifted his face to meet mine. \u201cI was so angry with him. I drove everywhere looking for you. I just wanted to tell you the truth about what I think and whatever. I looked everywhere for you, but I couldn't find you until I stopped to get gas. The old guy who sells his worms as bait there was telling Mike, the guy who owns the bakery, how he could swear he saw the crazy James girl running on the highway by the trail here.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and dragged a hand through his messy hair that I loved. \u201cThe funny thing about knowing someone for eighteen years, Aimes, is that you get to know certain things about them. I knew you would come to this beach.\u201d</p><p>He looked angry with me for a reason I couldn\u2019t place. I wondered what else Blake had told him, since I had pretty much divulged everything. My stomach hurt thinking about the ways I had betrayed him and vice versa.</p><p>I trembled, stopping dead in my tracks before I lashed out at him. I waited for him to finish. I needed to calm myself before I spoke to him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d He looked so defeated, it made me sick.</p> <p>I felt a trigger snap in my brain. \u201cYOU DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT TO SAY? YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY TO TELL ME THAT? AFTER YOU TOOK MY VIRGINITY AND AGREED TO COMMIT ME IN THE SAME DAY\u2014ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY IS YOU DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT TO SAY? WHAT THE FUCK?\u201d</p><p>He jumped at my shouting. \u201cAimes, please. The story is just so crazy, and you believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away from me.\u201d The words hurt me. They cut into my soul.</p><p>\u201cMaybe there is something, you know\u2014like a tumor. Aimes, you\u2019re living at the beach alone.\u201d He was pleading with me.</p><p>\u201cI know that, Shane. I know I\u2019m alone. None of the fucking assholes in my life believe me.\u201d I looked up at him. \u201cWell, except Aleks. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be here any minute. At least he hasn\u2019t abandoned me.\u201d It was a low blow; I knew that. I also knew Aleks wasn't coming, and I was truly alone.</p><p>He flinched. I saw anger flash in his eyes. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Aimee, what do you want? I will do anything!\u201d</p><p>I challenged him. \u201cBelieve me.\u201d</p><p>He slumped. \u201cAimee, there isn\u2019t anything wrong with you that I can see. You seem fine to me\u2014come home with me. I wish you\u2019d just come to me in the beginning of all of this. I wish you\u2019d trusted me. I hate the fact we've had all these secrets.\"</p><p>He stepped forward and put his hands over mine.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed the taste of him that lingered in the air, but as he neared me and touched me, my skin became electric.</p><p>I wanted to go home, I wanted a shower, I wanted to trust him, but I couldn\u2019t trust myself, not yet. I felt every move he made in the air around me. It scared me.</p><p>He snatched his hands back. \u201cOwe, Jesus! You shocked me.\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyes flutter from the ecstasy of touching him. \u201cGo, Shane.\u201d I breathed heavily, using all the restraint I had inside of me to stop myself from lashing out at him.</p><p>\u201cBlake told me you\u2019ve been seeing that Aleks guy behind my back the entire time we\u2019ve been seeing each other. Is that why you want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>The words hung out in the air. They felt like a black hole, taking everything good with them. I doubly hated Blake. I hated him for hurting Shane.</p><p>I didn\u2019t fight with Shane, because if I stopped fighting with myself, I would lose control. I knew I would hurt him. My hands wanted to hold him. They burned with the need. My stomach ached and twisted in pain and hunger.</p><p>He looked hurt. \u201cNothing to say? Well, anyway, I knew you were here, and I just wanted to give you this.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a piece of paper from his pocket.</p><p>His arm shook with rage as he held it out in the air for me. \u201cTake the fucking letter you wrote me, Aimee. I don\u2019t want those feelings or memories, because I know now that you\u2019re just like your sister. You\u2019re just like her.\u201d</p><p>He walked toward me. He looked like he would hurt me.</p><p>He stood over me, looming menacingly. I could taste his breath on the breeze.</p><p>He put the letter into my hands roughly. \u201cTake the fucking thing, Aimee. Just take it back. Take it all back\u2014I want to be free of you.\u201d</p><p>I flinched away from him. I was scared of what he would do next. Tears poured down my face.</p><p>He looked at me like I was nothing more than a nuisance.</p><p>I let him back away, before I whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from me to walk down the beach. I wanted to stay frozen in my tracks, but foolishly I ran to him as fast as I could. \u201cShane, wait, please.\u201d I grabbed his arm, pulling him back to me.</p><p>The minute his skin came in contact with mine, I felt it. I was pulling from him. He stood motionless as I filled up. The feeling was more joy than I had ever felt. I inhaled him through my hands somehow. I let go, hurting myself as if cutting off a vein feeding me. He shivered and swayed like he drank too much or stood up. Afraid of touching him, I backed away as he got his bearings.</p><p>He looked confused but turned away again, leaving me standing on the beach alone.</p><p>I hated Blake. I wanted to blame him for it all. It was fleeting and immature, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. I didn\u2019t move as I watched Shane get smaller and smaller. I felt cold and alone, even though the sun shone on me.</p><p>I blinked, realizing he was gone, probably had been for some time. I had stood there for a very long time. I watched the place he had entered the forest, leaving me forever. I knew I had made the wrong choice when I had met Aleks, and losing Shane was more painful than losing Aleks. I had never realized that losing him meant losing the person I wanted to be, and the life I wanted to have.</p><p>I turned and walked back to my campfire to stoke it for the night. I knew I would have to go home sooner or later, and at that moment, later sounded better. Whatever my hands had done was bad. Very bad.</p><p>The night was a cold one. Even I shivered with the breeze coming off of the water.</p><p>I heard rustling in the woods and hoped it was a wolf or bear coming to attack me and leave me in the woods to die.</p><p>I realized I would never die.</p><p>I had foolishly drunk from a demon.</p><p>In my despair, I fell asleep in between the logs and rocks. I woke up feeling refreshed again. I didn\u2019t know how long I had slept, but the summer fog had come in thick. On the North Coast the best way to tell when summer had hit was the fog. It rolled in every night at six and rolled out at eleven the next day. I was unable to see beyond a few feet in front of me. The fire had long gone out and was cold. I assumed I must have had one of those huge sleeps again. My hair was soaked from the mist in the fog and my fleece hung soaked on my shoulders. I curled my legs into me and waited for death to come and claim me.</p><p>After a very long time, I decided I was finished with the transition phase of my life. I needed to either be an undead, or to die, or to just be what I was at that moment. I stood stretching my legs and arms.</p><p>I started the long trek back to the trail. It had been more than three days, no doubt. I was ready to start my life all over again. I clearly wasn\u2019t a threat to my family as long as I didn\u2019t touch any of them. We had gone years without touching, and it wasn't like I would have a boyfriend or any friends when I got there. I got to the sandy beach but stopped walking. A grey figure sat on the sand looking down. I could tell immediately that it was Aleks. He looked bad, weak and exhausted, which I knew was impossible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walked toward him, but he never lifted his face.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you for leaving me with Dorian,\u201d I spoke quietly. I was defeated and tired of being alone.</p><p>He looked up. \u201cDon\u2019t forgive me. Never forget what I have taken from you.\u201d His voice scratched with despair. I didn\u2019t recognize it at all.</p> <p>I walked to him, getting lost in the beauty and feelings he made me feel. I stood between his legs and fought the urge to hug him and cuddle into him, just as I always did when I saw him. The memory of the look on Shane\u2019s face stopped me.</p><p>He raised his face and met my gaze. \u201cI love you so much, Aimee. It hurts so much to be away from you. I should leave you, but I can\u2019t bring myself to do it.\u201d</p><p>I dropped to my knees, accepting that my fate was to be with him, and that even with all we\u2019d been through a part of me still loved him.</p><p>I leaned into him. \u201cStay with me through this, Aleks. I need you as much as you need me.\u201d</p><p>I knew we were both alone in the world, and I had spent more than enough time alone. Okay, it had only been a few days, but it was enough to drive me to insanity. It wasn\u2019t a cruel fate, resigning myself to being with him, but it felt dirty. I was scared Shane was lurking around the woods watching me, seeing me snuggle into Aleks, even though it was him I loved.</p> <p>\u201cI need answers, Aleks.\u201d</p><p>He hugged me, burrowing his face into my neck.</p><p>He smelled me, ignoring my statement. \u201cI feel so much better when you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but agree, but I felt worried touching his skin. I kept my hands to cloth and tried not to think about what had happened with Shane.</p><p>\u201cDorian told me something about your dad; he said he had something to do with my mom's death.\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded hollow. \u201cHe did?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know you're sick right now, but I need you to tell me what that means.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Aimee. You can\u2019t hurt me unless you leave me again.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and cuddled into him, at least someone wanted to be with me.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo more running away.\u201d His voice still sounded hollow.</p><p>I slapped his chest. \u201cThe time where you get to dick me around and not share any secrets with me has past. I need and deserve at least, the truth.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, exhaling harshly. \u201cI know that, but I don\u2019t know how to tell you. This is serious. You know how you always say 'garden-variety this' and 'garden-variety that?' My curse was not one of those garden-variety ones; my dad angered a man whose powers still are unmatched to this day. No matter what I say, please try to remember that I love you,\u201d he whispered into my ear.</p><p>I nodded and waited for some serious answers to be laid out on the table.</p><p>He looked like he was trying to gather strength before he started to speak. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I sat there in silence, waiting.</p> <p>Finally he spoke. \u201cMy dad is immortal too. When I was young, he did something horrible. He raped and murdered a woman. I found him drunk with a woman dead beside him. I cleaned up the mess for him and hid the body. I thought it wasn\u2019t his fault. I thought he had been so drunk that it must have been an accident.\u201d</p><p>A small tear left his eye, making its slow trek across his face. \u201cMany times that year, people came looking for the woman. She was the medicine man's daughter. He was devastated that she had run away like that. They had apparently fought over whom she would marry. He used his magic, eventually, to try to find her. I don\u2019t know exactly how it works, but somehow the magic told him what had really happened. He showed up at my house when I was twelve\u2014he was angry. He cursed my dad, in hopes that my dad would murder our entire family. He cursed me with a type of immortality where I would forever feel responsible for my dad's actions. The curse would set in upon death.\u201d His voice wavered but he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cHe cursed me so that I would be forced to clean up after my dad every time. I would be forced to help the victims left behind, and from their suffering, I would get my sustenance. I would heal them over time, from the shadows. I have not seen my dad for over six hundred years.\u201d He stopped speaking as if unable, but I knew that was it. He was done speaking, even though an incomplete feeling hung in the air between us.</p><p>I allowed the knowledge to fill my brain and the feeling of heartbreak and anger to overwhelm me.</p><p>\u201cYour dad murdered my mom.\u201d It was a statement.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry, Aimee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came here to clean up the mess.\u201d Again a statement.</p><p>He nodded remorsefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat went wrong? How did we end up here?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou. I fell for you the moment I saw you. I spent too much time with you. I loved you. I couldn\u2019t focus on what I was doing. You sat on the side of the road telling me everything, and you were so perfect. You missed your mom the way I missed my family. You were right. This is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>I flinched at the thought of it. I wanted to comfort him, but I was not completely finished with the emotions I had brewing inside of me. I wanted answers more than anything at that moment. \u201cWhat does it mean now that your curse is gone?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cMy dad\u2019s victims will suffer incredibly. No one will help them.\u201d He looked sickened by it. \u201cI won't ever feel joy or peace again. I am now just a lost soul. I will forever be stuck in the in-between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have all of your abilities?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me incredulously.</p><p>I knew he was wondering how I was being so technical about it, but I had shut off my emotions for a moment to process what was going on. I was unable to feel sorry for him while I wasn\u2019t feeling sorry for myself.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel nothing being here with me now?\u201d</p><p>He smiled looking at me through his eyelashes, making my nerves quiver and my breath suck in. \u201cYou seem to be the exception to the rule. I love you and can feel love for you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in to kiss me, which I wanted, but I shook my head. \u201cYour dad raped and killed my mom. I can\u2019t do this right now. I need some more answers from you.\u201d</p><p>He looked dejectedly at me. \u201cAimee, I couldn\u2019t tell you the truth. You understand what I\u2019m saying, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIf you had been honest with me from the start when you realized I could see you, none of this would have happened.\u201d</p><p>\"You were already sick and my dad had already killed your mom.\"</p><p>I felt sick. \"I wish he hadn't. I wish we had never met.\"</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI know you do. I won't bother you. If that's your wish.\u201d He leaned in and kissed me and like a puff of smoke was gone.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to do. I hadn\u2019t wanted him to go, had I? He hadn\u2019t waited around for me to answer him.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to be alone again. I pulled my legs up and waited to die. I hadn\u2019t eaten. I hadn\u2019t drunk. I hoped at some point I would die and it would end.</p><p>I was sad about my mom, but I knew Aleks would be hurting more than I was.</p><p>His own dad killed the mom of the woman he loved\u2014was I a woman yet?</p><p>I shrugged, assuming if you had to ask, you were still a girl.</p><p>I curled into a ball and fell asleep again until I heard the bushes rustle behind me, waking me up. I wondered if it was his dad coming for his turn with me. I didn\u2019t turn around. I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Aleks whispered, \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He sat beside me, pulling me into him. He slipped his huge black fleece off and pulled it over my head. I didn\u2019t realize I was cold until the warmth from his jacket seeped into my skin.</p><p>I shivered, closing my eyes. I had gotten to the place of insanity. I wasn\u2019t certain any of it was real anymore. I was thinking either side effect of the drug, or that I was dead, or it was the long-assumed brain tumor.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going to go?\u201d I asked, knowing that I couldn\u2019t go back to my place. I couldn\u2019t stay one more day at the beach without murdering an entire village out of boredom.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou can\u2019t go anywhere until you change.\u201d</p><p>I laughed bitterly. \u201cI\u2019m not changing, Aleks. It isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m still me, just a bit different. I\u2019m the same as I was when I was at Blake\u2019s a week ago. Too bad Blake\u2019s didn\u2019t work out. I could use a shower.\u201d</p><p>He nodded laughing. \u201cYour body had to be healed by Dorian\u2019s blood before it can start to transform. You were on your deathbed. Dorian saved you, as much as that disgusts me. Now that you\u2019re all healed up inside, the change should start to take place.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him. \u201cWhy do you hate him, beyond the obvious winning personality traits I experienced?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t hate him. I just don\u2019t like dark angels. Everything they touch somehow turns to shit. Anyway, I want to get you somewhere warm for the night.\u201d</p><p>I smirked at him. \u201cOkay. I smell.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. It was still weak but he seemed to be a little perkier.</p><p>I was pretty sure I was thinking of the same thing as he was, a hotel room. That could get awkward.</p><p>Thinking about what had happened the other day with Shane, I changed my mind. \u201cUhh, we should probably stay out here. We can make a fire again.\u201d</p><p>Aleks looked at me doubtfully. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lower lip and sighed, feeling ashamed of myself. \u201cI saw Shane the other day. He came here and was so angry with me. Blake had told him everything that\u2019s happened so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlake knows everything? Everything, including me?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound impressed.</p><p>I knew my eyes answered for me when disappointment filled his face.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows at me. \u201cI told you those things in confidence.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cAleks, you kept leaving me, and I didn\u2019t know what to do or where to go. I just needed someone on my team.\u201d</p><p>He gripped my shoulders harshly. \u201cI am always on your team. I just know what kind of danger I bring with me everywhere I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShane was very angry about what happened between us. He was cruel, and I deserved every second of it. I dated you both at the same time. I\u2019m disgusting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aleks chewed the side of his lower lip. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be around him anyway. First, I don\u2019t like it, and second, you could hurt him.\u201d</p><p>All I heard was the word him. I could hurt him.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI can\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cNo. I am doomed to walk the earth alone. Nothing can hurt me. Do you honestly think that I\u2019ve never attempted dying?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t ever thought about it. I assumed he enjoyed his life of eternity, doing whatever he wanted and exploring. Well, beyond helping the odd family.</p><p>Aleks looked at me and rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not like in the movies, Aimee. I don\u2019t have a mansion somewhere with all kinds of international money and friends in all the right places. I am alone almost all of the time, except for the odd demon or other mythical being. Anyway, did you hurt Shane?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, flinching at the ever-increasing disappointment in his eyes. \u201cIt was an accident. I grabbed him to try to make him listen, and my hands pulled from him like they were sucking on him. I looked at him and he was still, like a zombie, and I was filling up. I let go and he left. He seemed dizzy and weird afterward.\u201d</p><p>He smirked at me. \u201cYou got lucky. Your abilities haven\u2019t set in yet. Until you learn to control that, you might want to refrain from touching anyone.\u201d He looked at me through his lashes. \u201cExcept me, of course.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at him, knowing I probably wouldn't be able to touch him, not while Shane was alive. That gave us anywhere from sixty to eighty years to work out what we were to each other. It made me smile disgustedly. It was the life sentence I deserved.</p><p>We walked back up the beach to where I had built my fire initially, and I watched as he made the new fire. He was much faster at it than I was, and within a very short amount of time, we were sitting by a very warm fire. I felt the damp and the cold, but I didn\u2019t hurt or ache the way I would have before kissing Dorian.</p><p>I needed to see my family before Blake decided to continue his witch-hunt and tell my sister. I didn\u2019t want Blake filling their heads with all sorts of truth without me explaining. I hadn\u2019t chosen the path I was on because I had a death wish. I looked at Aleks and recalled how it had only been a few weeks since I was ready to die to be with him.</p><p>If I could have one wish, I would end everything between us, just to have all of them back again. The fact that I wasn\u2019t graduating was bothering me beyond belief. I knew I could get my diploma instantly with only a few phone calls. All of my finals had been in January, and generally the last classes were labs and advanced placements. I could have done them all over again in university.</p><p>I missed my guild on World of Warcraft, and I missed just chilling, eating a bowl of cereal with my dad, watching the Discovery Channel. From the inside and safety of my home, I had wished for excitement and adventure before my mom had died.</p><p>I sat in the middle of a real life adventure and instead of having fun, I was very ready to turn in my hiking boots for flip-flops and boredom. I wanted regular. I wanted Giselle\u2019s million text messages about hot doctors. I wanted to hear where she was going to get a tattoo. She had millions of things to say about tattoos. First, it would have to be nice enough to hide her scars. Second, she would want to still have it when she was old, like thirty-five and shit. And third, it would have to enhance her sexiness, not make her look trashy. Exotic, not stripper. I smiled, recalling the conversation.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t make myself get past the fact that my happiness had been the price of Aleks. I knew it wasn\u2019t entirely his fault, but I saw him as the catalyst that had brought me to that moment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in love with me, are you?\u201d he asked, looking me in the eye, demanding an answer.</p><p>I was amazed at how easily he had read my face. I forgot that he had spent months memorizing everything I did.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know anything anymore.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and stood up. He walked to where I sat. He did look sexy in the firelight; I had to give him that.</p><p>He stood in front of me. \u201cI will wait as long as you need to figure things out. I\u2019ve waited over six hundred years for you. Every day I died being forced to live without love. You\u2019ve taught me to love again and given me a renewed sense of hope.\u201d</p><p>In the darkness, his blue eyes stood out even more. They sparkled. He knelt in front of me in the sand. He brushed my hair from my face on either side. His warm hands sent chills up my spine. I watched his eyes for a moment. They changed and became cold and hard. They burned with a hatred, frightening me. His face twitched as he spoke to the side of my head, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I realized he was speaking behind my head. I was off my driftwood, being pulled roughly to the far side of the fire, and placed behind him before I could register what was going on. I couldn\u2019t see anything, only feel his tense body holding me still.</p> <p>\u201cSon, I just wanted to see you. I\u2019ve missed you all these years. I know you've missed me,\u201d a man spoke. He laughed.</p><p>I looked through the rigid arms holding me in place to see a naked man. He was in his forties, if I had to guess. He was as large as Aleks was, and he looked like Aleks. His eyes were the same white blue. I knew him instantly to be Aleks' father.\"</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve missed me by running from me every time. I have spent six centuries cleaning up your messes.\u201d Aleks' voice was a deep growl. I had no idea what he was capable of until that moment. He had always seemed like a friendly gentle giant with me, but he was not the same man confronting his father. At that moment he scared me, even though he was protecting me.</p><p>The naked man stood tall, proud of his physique. I managed to avoid letting my eyes fall below his face, but it was a struggle.</p><p>He held his arms out as if in peace. \u201cSon, I just thought that maybe you would want to bury the hatchet. Besides, I haven\u2019t met your young lady yet. You\u2019re being rude, Aleksander.\u201d</p><p>His dad maintained his Norwegian accent, more than likely because he spent most of his time alone.</p><p>I felt Aleks's grip tighten on me, his muscles flexed in his back and arms. \u201cShe is none of your concern. This is between you and me.\u201d His dad looked as if he were starting to get upset. His body shook in a way I\u2019d only ever seen in a person having a seizure.</p><p>His eyes were fixed on me as he licked his lips. His stare was beyond menacing. Instantly, we were moving. I closed my eyes and we stopped.</p><p>I was standing outside Shane\u2019s house. Aleks faced me, looking down at me. \u201cI need to do this. I\u2019m so sorry, but I\u2019ve waited for over six hundred years to be able to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill him for me too.\u201d</p><p>He bent and pressed his lips to mine firmly. There was no messing around with flirty kissing. Just a solid kiss, and then the warm air surrounded me.</p><p>He was gone and I was alone again. I turned to look at Shane\u2019s huge house and knew I wasn\u2019t welcome there. I wanted to go home, but I was terrified Blake had been to my dad's already.</p><p>My poor dad. I wished I had just been honest with him from the beginning. I walked around the side of Shane\u2019s house and sat on the deck. His windows were closed and he was inside watching TV. I could hear the TV just faintly from the kitchen window that was wide open. I imagined I was in there watching it with him, snuggled into him and warm.</p><p>Instead, I sat on the hard deck and waited for Aleks to come back, which was unlikely. I knew his dad would either kill him or run away. I was completely alone again, but this time something was different.</p><p>My skin had started to burn and my vision had started to blur. I hugged myself tightly as the stomachache started again, but this time it was intense. I moaned\u2014I couldn\u2019t help myself. I got up, afraid Shane would hear me. I started toward the stalker woods. My legs crumpled along the way, taking me down on the grass. I heard a scream and should have been scared, but I hurt too much to worry about that girl. I crawled along the grass, feeling the sweat pour off of me. I heard the scream again. It was starting to annoy me that the girl wouldn\u2019t shut up.</p><p>\u201cAimee...Aimee... is that you? Aimee, oh my God.\u201d I heard Shane\u2019s voice in the background but I tried to crawl away from him. I needed to keep him safe. I felt the black coming to take me. Shane\u2019s worried face and mouth moving was the last thing I saw. I couldn\u2019t hear anything over the girl screaming.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>When is anything ever enough?</p><p>I heard noises. It sounded like someone talking. There were a few of them. I didn\u2019t know where I was, but I was worried Shane was with me. I was so worried I would hurt him. My body felt as if someone had taken a tiny blade and cut every inch of me, and then dripped orange juice on it. I even stung on the bottoms of my feet.</p><p>I figured the townsfolk had heard I was a monster and had come with pitchforks to claim me. I could hear them arguing, but I didn\u2019t know what they were saying. I tried to ignore the immense amounts of pain my brain was coping with, and turned off my emotional body. I listened as my sister, Blake, Shane, and someone I didn\u2019t know argued. It was a woman\u2019s voice. I assumed it was Shane\u2019s mom.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s changing, just like she said she would.\u201d Shane\u2019s voice sounded like he was defending me.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s sick. We need to get her to a mental institute. The drugs have done something very bad to her; I think she has drug-induced schizophrenia.\u201d Blake spoke coldly. I couldn\u2019t believe he hated me that much to want to commit me.</p><p>I heard a growl. \u201cBlake, you try to take her and I will kill you.\u201d Shane was defending me. Bliss and guilt rotated inside of me.</p><p>\u201cBoys, seriously. I think we need to think about the fact that it\u2019s Aimee. Boring, lame Aimee. She would never do this on purpose. She hates life or any sort of exciting things and would never worry my dad like this. This is not the norm for her; she is sick. She needs a hospital, not the nutter one either, Blake\u2014I can't believe you said that.\u201d My sister tried to help. I tried not to be offended.</p><p>\u201cShane, I think Alise is right. She needs a doctor. She seems very sick.\u201d The mystery woman spoke, trying to reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, she stays here. If we take her to a hospital, they\u2019re going to think it's what he thinks it is. There is no way I\u2019m doing that to her.\u201d Shane was defiant.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t choose you, man. You're defending some other dude's girl.\u201d Blake\u2019s words cut like a knife.</p><p>\u201cI chose her.\u201d Shane\u2019s words cut deeper. I wanted to scream I was so frustrated. \u201cYou\u2019re her best friend; you should have chosen her too. I want you both the fuck out of my house.\u201d Shane wasn\u2019t negotiating.</p> <p>\u201cShane, she's my sister. I\u2019ll go get my dad, and he\u2019ll come get her.\u201d My sister tried to threaten him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you really think involving your dad is the way to help her? If you really want to hurt your dad like that, Alise, go ahead. You\u2019re more selfish than I thought. Neither of you is thinking what\u2019s best for Aimee. What if she does change into something? What if she did drink demon blood? The doctors will lock her away, poking and prodding her.\u201d Shane was my only salvation at that point.</p><p>The pain was too brutal again. I moaned in agony.</p><p>I opened my eyes and cringed at the light. Shane was beside me. His mom looked down on me from behind him.</p><p>He knelt beside me. I was on a couch in his sunroom, the make out room. It was where it all started, and it was where it was all ending.</p> <p>\u201cAimee, can you hear me?\u201d Shane spoke.</p><p>My eyes flickered open and shut. \u201cYeah,\u201d I croaked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I tried to make a smile on my lips. \u201cNo, I am the one who is sorry. I love you, Shane, and I want you to have this. I meant it, every word.\u201d I reached into my fleece pocket and pulled out the crumpled damp letter. \u201cI chose you; I always chose you.\u201d</p><p>He took it from me and bent down to kiss my forehead.</p><p>I realized then and there that when faced with losing either guy in my life, it was Shane that was killing me. I could live without Aleks, but there was no way I could live without Shane.</p> <p>The pain grew in intensity again, making me scream.</p><p>Shane held me. He held me tightly until I pushed him away. \u201cMy skin sucks the life out of you. You can\u2019t touch me. I\u2019m becoming something evil.\u201d My voice was almost gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d He wrapped me in a blanket and held me. He wiped my face with something cold. It felt refreshing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s burning up, Shane. Maybe a hospital?\u201d his mom suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His responses had not improved.</p><p>I felt myself black out again, lost in a space and time that didn\u2019t matter. I floated in a black sea of emptiness.</p><p>I woke to someone laughing. I knew the voice. \u201cAimee, Aimee, Aimee, whatever will we do with you?\u201d It was an evil voice. It mocked my pain. \u201cYou foolish girl. You should have stayed with me. It\u2019s taken me a week to find you. Days you\u2019ve suffered needlessly.\u201d</p><p>I felt a finger roughly open my eye. I was on the couch in the sunroom. I recognized the pictures of Shane hanging over the fireplace. My eyes focused to see Dorian\u2019s smiling face. I would have been afraid, but at that point I just wanted death.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready to end this?\u201d he asked, grinning his evil-villain grin. I nodded.</p><p>He held his finger over my mouth and sliced it with his fingernail. I watched his black blood drip into my face from his other hand. I tried not to swallow, but he forced it in my mouth. I felt like I was drowning. The warm liquid slid down my throat like the slug it had looked like.</p><p>He picked me up and carried me to the back door. I looked around the house to see no one there. Where had Shane gone?</p><p>I blacked out again as I felt Dorian jump off the back deck and land in the grass with a thud.</p><p>I felt my face move. I felt cold air. I was outside again. I didn\u2019t hurt anymore. I sensed I wasn\u2019t alone, but I heard nothing. I opened one eye cautiously to see Dorian bent over me. He was smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy, good morning. Had a good sleep, I assume.\u201d He stood up, offering me his hand. I took his hand, feeling completely disoriented. I was in the forest again, not near the beach. There was no salt in the air, just the cool dampness of the woods. I looked around me, seeing nothing but Dorian. He stood looking at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cAm I dead?\u201d I asked slowly. I wondered if he had ended my life with his black goo.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, you are, and yet, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him. I hated him and his stupid riddles. He was as bad as Aleks; he never answered any of my questions.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Aleks?\u201d I asked, hoping he had at least killed his dad.</p><p>\"I'm not his keeper.\"</p><p>\"What are you?\"</p><p>He waved a finger in front of my face. \u201cDoes it matter? What I find more fun and interesting is that there is no one here to save you this time. Nowhere you can run to, that I can't find you. Elevators are tricky for me. Can't wink into moving objects. Not that it matters now. You\u2019re mine.\u201d He started to walk around me slowly in a circle, as if inspecting me. He looked like a wolf circling a bunny.</p><p>I didn\u2019t feel like a bunny though; I felt strong. I felt like I could kill him if I had to. I frowned, wondering how that thought had popped into my mind.</p><p>I squeezed my hands, flexing them. I was strong. I just knew it.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou can feel it, can't you? You\u2019re reborn and brand new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d</p><p>He looked innocently at me as he flashed his black eyes. \u201cI saved you, Aimee. You would have been in the ground already if not for me.\u201d He stepped very close to my face. \u201cWhere is your gratitude?\u201d His face grew very wicked.</p><p>He pressed his lips into mine forcefully. My lips crushed into my teeth. I winced as he forced his tongue in my mouth. I could taste a small amount of residue from his blood in my mouth. It made me want to gag. I pushed him away, and he flew backwards, slamming into a tree.</p><p>His evil smile grew as he moaned. \u201cThere\u2019s my girl. See how easy it is to lose your cool. If I had been a human, you would have hurt me very badly, if not killed me,\u201d he taunted me.</p><p>He relished in the moment. I could see it in his eyes. I looked down at my hands. I was very strong. I could never lose it around my sister or Shane, no matter what. I held off judgment on whether Blake was going to feel my full wrath or not.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d he asked as he walked toward me.</p><p>\u201cI am hungry.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but admit it. I felt ravenous.</p><p>He stepped behind a tree and pulled out a girl who looked terrified from behind the huge old cedar tree. She was tied up with a gag in her mouth.</p><p>\"Dorian, what have you done?\" I was horrified.</p><p>He brought her to me. She looked frightened as she glanced from me to him and back to me. Her soft, green eyes pleaded with me to save her. Her tear-stained cheeks and sniffling nose pained me, but the terror in her eyes sickened me. She spoke volumes with her eyes, begging me to free her.</p><p>I wanted to\u2014I wanted to untie her and run with her as fast as I could. I wanted to get her away from him, but something about her sweet face made me want to touch her. I felt compelled to let my fingers just brush, a little, against her soft skin.</p><p>She was my age, if not a little older. She had long, blonde hair like mine, but hers was thinner and wispier. She was very pretty, which didn\u2019t seem to affect me. All I saw was the life inside of her; it sparkled. I wanted some of that sweet life.</p><p>I looked at her white t-shirt with pink jammie pants, and assumed Dorian had taken her from her bed.</p><p>Everything in my body told me to save the girl. Nearly everything inside of me screamed to run away from her. A small dominant part of me whispered for me to just brush against her thin bare arm, with just one finger. I wanted just one taste of her. I couldn\u2019t fight myself as I lifted my right hand. I touched the soft fabric of her white cotton shirt. I could see her pink nipples sticking out in the cool forest air through her thin t-shirt. I let my hand fall to her bare arm, and her skin jolted against mine.</p><p>She had been struggling until I touched her. Then she stood very still. I let my finger drag down her bicep, filling me up.</p><p>I pulled my hand away, shutting off the sensation.</p><p>She looked dazed, taking deep breaths. I let my finger brush her warm skin again, and as I touched her, I felt the sensation again. I was being filled up.</p><p>I pulled away again. An unnamed need filled me so strongly. I felt my body act before my brain could react. I grabbed both of her bare arms with my hands and held her tightly. I was certain I would tear the arms right off of her. I felt a light come down from the sky like a sunbeam as I was filled completely.</p><p>There had been a void inside of me, a hole that had needed filling. I had been unaware of it until I touched her. I had mistaken it as hunger. I pulled every last little bit from her. I felt her run out\u2014I was still a little hungry, so to speak. I squeezed her thin arms hoping to get every last little drop.</p><p>As the connection faded and she was empty, I let go. She fell to the ground in a heap. I flexed my thin fingers, stretched them. I felt alive in that moment, like I was a battery that had just been recharged.</p><p>I looked at Dorian, whose eyes sparkled with life, as he watched me experience it for the first time. He knew the feeling I was having at that moment. It was ecstasy.</p><p>I looked down at the heap of girl on the ground. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, she\u2019s gone, my dear. Try to think of them as sheep. It gets easier.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. I didn\u2019t fully comprehend what was being said. I knelt beside her and shook her. I could see the places I had squeezed so hard on her thin arms. She moved like a sleeping person when I shook her, but she didn\u2019t stir.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve drained her life from her. She's a shell now. Her soul is free.\u201d His voice was a whisper in the silent forest.</p><p>I looked up at him and felt a tear form in my eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s dead. I killed her.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s either feed off of them or die yourself.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say. I wanted to run. I wanted to run away from her. She was proof that I was a monster. I felt the forest spinning around me as I looked for an escape or a solution. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat am I?\u201d I panicked. I could feel my breath getting out of control.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an immortal now. Every immortal has a specific need. It\u2019s how we survive. Vampires need blood, lycanthropes need raw flesh, succubi need human emotions, and we need souls, or rather, the separation of the soul. We feed on the tearing that occurs when the soul is set free.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him. \u201cWhat are we?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cDeath Deities, Sin Eater, Grim Reaper, Black Angel of Death. You choose. Either way, your touch does tend to finalize everything in one's life.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDeath Deities? No, that\u2019s a myth. That\u2019s mythology.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the dead girl and knew that what he had said was true. I was what he had said. I looked at my hands. They were long and slender but nothing about them looked out of the ordinary. They were my mom's hands. I'd always loved that. I shivered, imagining my mom looking down on me comparing our hands. Hers had never been as dirty as mine were.</p><p>I dropped to my knees, astonished at how much I could hate myself, Dorian, and Aleks, all at once.</p><p>\u201cThis is the fate I chose instead of death, instead of my one single death? I'll survive by doling out death, like I was God? Like I have any right to choose for others? How could you not tell me? How could Aleks not tell me?\u201d</p> <p>My words felt as if they belonged to another. My voice sounded too hollow to be mine.</p><p>Dorian ignored me. He looked at his cell phone, as if I were keeping him from something pressing. Something besides the death and burial of a girl. I knew, that to him, this was one useless girl. I shuddered as I looked at her. I wondered if he had used his mind tricks to do terrible things to her first.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t reason with myself. I was death, and that was a fate I was going to have to find a way to work around. \u201cYou've made me into Death. I'm Death. Will I kill everything I touch?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and sighed impatiently. \u201cNo, you have to learn to shut it off and on. You have to learn to control it.\u201d He kicked the girl on the ground, not respecting her limp dead body. \u201cThis is because you were too hungry. If you let it get too far, your hunger will take over. You will feed, Aimee. We always feed. If you don\u2019t get too hungry, you can be picky. You can choose the evil or sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her.\u201d I shrieked at him and picked the dead girl up off of the forest floor.</p><p>I held her like she was my sister, my kin. If she were my family, I would want something else for her, beyond some disgusting demon kicking her corpse in the woods. She was still warm in my hands. I didn\u2019t know what to do with her. I smelled in the air for the ocean and started to run toward the smell of the salt. I had never seen a dead body before, let alone held one in my arms. I wanted to hug her and cry and tell her everything would be okay, even when it wouldn\u2019t. It would never be okay; I had taken her life.</p> <p>I ran as fast as I could, which apparently was pretty fast. I saw the ocean through the trees and ran down to the beach. I looked both ways to ensure no one saw me carrying a dead girl out into the open waters. I felt the cold ocean water hit me like a refreshing wave. The cold didn\u2019t hurt like it should have. I swam out into the chuck, holding her hand. I swam as hard as I could, until I reached a good distance from the beach. I was amazed at how quickly I could swim. I let all of my breath out and grabbed the dead girl's hand. I sank like a stone down into the cool ocean water.</p><p>The seawater didn\u2019t bother my open eyes. I watched seaweed and small fish pass by us as we sank into the dark. When I reached the bottom of the sea floor, I found a big rock. I pinned her under the rock, trying desperately not to think about what I was doing. I left her there in her pink pajamas and white t-shirt. I looked at the peaceful look on her face and felt nauseous. I swam to the surface, kicking with my legs as fiercely as I could. When I broke the surface, I breathed in relief to feel the air in my lungs. No air in my lungs felt unnatural. I swam to shore and crawled out of the ocean waves. I felt defeated.</p><p>I tried to be realistic about the whole situation. It was my first time being a soul-sucking demon. It was my first kick at the can feeding off of a person. I made a rookie mistake. I could do better. I could find a cancer ward or criminals and easily put them out of their misery. I knew that if I\u2019d been warned or trained by someone with compassion and care, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. I looked into the forest where I knew Dorian was, and decided I would try my luck alone for a while. I knew I couldn\u2019t stay in my hometown, as no doubt I would be a danger to anyone I knew.</p><p>I started to run along the beach and dove into the water again. I knew Portland was my only hope. I shut myself off. I shut off my feelings for Shane. I had no feelings for Blake, not any I was willing to act upon. I knew my sister and my dad would be desperately sad without me, but at least they would be alive. I shut off my feelings for the girl on the ocean floor, who didn\u2019t deserve the death she received.</p><p>I swam until I reached the harbor. I never really tired, but I got winded and bored after a while.</p><p>When I got there, I crawled out breathlessly and dragged my sopping cold body into an alley. I pressed my back against the wall and waited for things to make sense\u2014no money, no food, no shelter. No friends. No Shane. No Aleks. I shook my head and tried to reason with myself. Tried to make it make sense.</p><p>I noticed a scent on the cool breeze. I lifted my nose and took a deep inhale. The smell was ecstasy\u2014like a donut shop or patisserie. My mouth watered. I opened my eyes and realized what I was seeing. It was a couple walking hand in hand. I was smelling them. They smelled like dessert. I turned and ran into the alley. I wouldn\u2019t take another life. No matter what. I dragged myself into a cardboard box and closed my eyes.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p> <p>How much sin can a sin eater eat in a city full of sin?</p><p>One Year Later - Portland, Oregon</p><p>My palms grew warm. They itched with a burning I could not soothe. I wiped them on my pants back and forth. I dragged them and waited for the release. It was the same every time. I still had no patience like I\u2019d had when I was alive. I had lost my ability to sit still. My trigger finger itched, so to speak. I had no trigger that the human eye could see. I was near the alley I had been in when she had rescued me. I shivered and tried not to think about how bad it had all gotten, how hungry I had been. I shook my head and snapped back to the visual I had on the mark.</p><p>I had been out for coffee when I saw him the first time. I knew he would work to fulfill my hunger once I cleared him with the Roses. He was raging when he had stormed past the coffee shop window where I had been sitting. I followed him cautiously. I knew one small move could send me into attack mode. I was still coping with the hunger. The training helped, but the hunger was something that I would battle my whole life.</p><p>I watched him from the building across the street, through the window. Even though I wanted to eat him, like I did all of them, I always looked for something I could save. It was always the same thing. I had to see there was no other option. It was also Roses protocol.</p><p>Secretly, I hated taking their lives, even though I knew their families would be free of the monster. Most of the time, the monster was someone they had unwittingly married or been born to. That was the part I tried to remember when I saw the family members crying. They were always devastated by the death, even if their life had been bad.</p><p>I heard a shout from the apartment. I looked up to see him pacing in the window. He screamed at motionless beings that I could not see within the tiny window. I could see him trembling. He was about to commit a crime and break Rose law. I sighed, thankful he was the one. I was getting too hungry and would end up attacking someone who didn\u2019t deserve it, not the way Peter did.</p><p>I thumbed the platinum ring on my right hand mindlessly watching, always watching. The Roses had saved me from myself in a moment of weakness and sorrow. I wished I could save Peter, but he had taken it too far; his kind always did. The Fae didn\u2019t work well with humans. Humans were too weak.</p><p>His hands flew back and forth, expressing his rage. He stopped, hovering a moment over something or someone. No one moved beyond him and no words were spoken besides his.</p><p>He was a monster, trying desperately to control his change, surrounded by humans. Weak and breakable humans. I literally watched as his mind lost its control. It was like a twig breaking from a branch. It made the most pronounced snap as the control was lost and the monster emerged.</p><p>He shouted and then his fists came down on the couch. They came down hard, making screams match the fury they hit with. His arms moved like a madman's clawing and hitting.</p><p>He was going to shift in front of them. I knew it wasn't entirely his fault. He had been desperately trying to contain the beast inside, but his history had proven he could not. He had made the mistake of thinking that he would be able to have a normal life.</p><p>I winked myself inside to see the madness. The inhabitants of the room could not see me as they covered themselves completely. I watched the horror show of Peter raging at the couch and the people curling against each other. A mom tried to protect her two small children. She used her body as a shield.</p><p>Peter\u2019s face grew distorted as his head shivered and shook.</p><p>His rage was bringing out the beast. He literally would not be human within seconds.</p><p>I leapt forward, not even worrying about whether I was seen or not. I touched Peter's quivering shoulder. I smiled down at the small child on the couch, who peeked up at me from under his mom's bleeding arm. He smiled through the tears when his eyes met mine. I watched as lips formed the word, \u201cAngel\u201d.</p><p>I winked quickly, removing Peter and myself from the house before I was seen by anyone beyond the small child. Outside in the alley, Peter tried to fight me, but once I let my hands have what they wanted, he was frozen. I sucked him dry in seconds, before anyone would see. I left his body on the ground outside of the apartment.</p><p>Peter\u2019s body would remain in human form long enough for the medical examiner to rule it a heart attack. His body wouldn\u2019t decay the way a regular human would, but he would be buried or burned before then. I wondered what I would decay into if I were able to die. It was the one thing I envied in them, all of them. I could kill them, but nothing could take me from my existence? I left my pain in the alley with his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was back on the street again in an instant, walking down the road. I felt the adrenaline I got from him bouncing around inside me. They gave me a better soul separation high than innocents; they were just harder to find. Bad humans were everywhere. The Roses didn\u2019t like me taking humans though. They wanted me to govern the way I was trained.</p><p>I looked down at my boots, clicking on the street. I wondered what it was about them that made me feel sexy. I had contemplated it over and over many times in my new life. Boots made me feel sexy, and it was a mystery beyond everything else as to why. For me, there was strength in a pair of boots, like a super power.</p><p>I had started wearing them when I first got trained to be a Rose. When Lydia had saved me from the alley and the starvation.</p> <p>The click of them made me happy.</p><p>My sister had always worn them.</p><p>I blocked that thought out of my mind. I wasn\u2019t that girl anymore. I didn\u2019t have a sister anymore. I had to let them all go.</p><p>I smiled to myself, feeling good about my night. I knew I had made a difference. I didn\u2019t think about the soul I had taken. I tried not to think about it once the choice was made.</p><p>I liked to think about the survivors.</p> <p>I had decided I was a warrior for the innocent. I had decided that being a death dealer didn\u2019t have to involve sucking good people dry. I decided it was time someone defended the innocent from the evil. It was better to be known for killing out of control monsters than innocent people. Luckily, it had turned out I wasn\u2019t alone in my pursuit, and had found people I belonged with. Or rather, they had found me. I fingered my platinum ring as I walked down the street.</p><p>I jumped on the subway and tried to blend in. I hoped my eyes weren\u2019t still glowing.</p><p>The subway ride was exactly the sort of mindless activity I craved when I was scouting for trouble. It was monotonous until the group of men a few seats away, started to harass the pretty waitress near me. I waited as always for them to stop being assholes\u2014I tried to not interfere. It almost always involved someone dying. I finally understood Aleksander not wanting to get involved with humans. Explaining anything I did was too complex.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t, however, going to sit by and let a waitress entertain a group of men against her will in the train tunnels either. I could tell the men weren't going to let it go. They were going to hurt her. They went further and further with the joking until they had worked each other up, and there was no turning back.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s a slut, boys. I think she wants something from us.\u201d One gentlemanly man spoke above the noise of the train. He groped his groin, smiling at the helpless woman. He stood up and rubbed his groin grotesquely on her shoulder. I sat, shaking, trying to keep my head down. I was supposed to be looking for supernaturals and immortals, not attacking young men. The woman had tried to pull away but the filthy pervert held onto her tightly. He stood hovering over her like she was his next meal.</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s hot. You\u2019re a ho, aren't ya, baby?\u201d another of the superior males muttered when the girl tried to stand up. The gyrating pervert pushed her back down into her seat. They hovered over her like vultures, awaiting the end of the ride.</p> <p>Every word and movement drove my upper lip to lift farther and farther on the right side, into a disgusted sneer. They wanted to do things I could never permit. I had forbidden myself from hurting regular humans, unless they were putting another human in danger.</p><p>\u201cL-l-leave me alone.\u201d The pretty girl begged, looking around the train for aid from anyone. As per the usual, the fine patrons of the train kept their eyes to their hands. They showed no sign of interfering in the pain she would certainly become victim to. I could sense their good intentions were being stifled by the fear they felt toward the group of men. I knew that they would dial 911 for the girl as soon as the men grabbed her and dragged her into the tunnels. That was what good Samaritans did. I almost rolled my eyes.</p><p>As if answering my prayer, a huge man dressed as a construction worker stood up. He was a beast. He looked menacingly at the small group of men. \u201cLeave her be.\u201d His voice was gruff. \u201cCome with me.\u201d He put a hand out. It shook as he reached for her.</p><p>The waitress stood quickly and ran away from the men. She rushed to the arm of the man who saved her, her savior. She clutched her bag and refused to look back at the pack of wolves.</p><p>The big man pulled her along the train and through the door to the next car. The men screamed obscenities and challenges of brute strength. The happy couple left the train car, ignoring them completely.</p><p>The men continued to shout. It was easy to be strong when you had several men guarding your back.</p><p>I smiled, knowing the waitress and the construction worker would probably fall in love because of his bravery. He had saved her and she would forever remember that, through thick and thin. I loved happy endings. I knew that they could get off the subway and never speak to each other again, but I liked to imagine the best since my world was the worst. Shane was my knight in shining armor. The one that chose me, even when he feared I never choose him.</p><p>I smiled as the fiends eyeballed me next. Their prey had been taken brutishly and they needed someone else to fulfill their need. I had my own needs and a group of thugs would do more than nicely to satisfy them.</p> <p>\u201cHow unfair, boys. No one to play with now?\u201d I taunted wickedly.</p><p>Eyebrows raised in confusion.</p><p>Confidence in a woman was considered a challenge to men who did their preying in packs. They instantly smelled, no, reeked of insecurities. They became uncertain of the young pretty girl who sat all alone\u2014but determined to crush me at the same time.</p><p>I looked them straight in the eyes and asked for trouble. I smiled. \u201cWell, I guess no one wants to play with me.\u201d I stretched a long, lean leg out, flaunting my F-me boots and batting my eyelashes.</p><p>The ugly brave or foolish man who had dry humped the girl's arm stood. He challenged me back. \u201cYou stupid bitch. You looking for trouble?\u201d</p><p>His filthy demeanor made me smile wider. \u201cBitch? Probably. Stupid? No. Why don't we step outside when the train stops? Then perhaps we shall see exactly who is stupid, your little rabble of filth or me.\u201d</p><p>I stood long and lean in my super-woman boots and felt the world vibrate under my foot. It might have been the train, but I was riding a high and enjoying the feeling.</p><p>I didn\u2019t flinch as one of them took a step toward me.</p><p>My long, light-blonde hair flowed around my back like a cape. I was invincible. I stared down the pack of dogs.</p><p>The ugly man waved his arms in the air dismissively and nodded to his friends. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy bitch. We don\u2019t like crazy bitches.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue with that. I was crazy.</p><p>They smiled nervously and nodded amongst their small circle, speaking in a low rumble. They continued their name-calling, but agreed amongst them that I wasn\u2019t pretty enough for their attentions. I walked over to the door and with my back to them, I watched in the window beside me. They conspired against me weakly, and I decided they were far too beneath my efforts.</p><p>I walked off the train, noticing the cool breeze in the air along with the familiar smell of burned incense. It was a dark smell, musty and old like the soul it belonged to. It was winter and the smell of decay, but in a romantic hue instead of the decomposition it truly was, overwhelmed the senses.</p><p>I looked around without seeing anything or anyone. I smiled at the true challenge of the night. There were many of them. Instead of winking home, I broke into a run. I winked a small distance and ran. They would have run me down if I'd just run. I was fast but not fast like them.</p><p>I loved the click of my high-heeled boots on the concrete as I sprinted up the stairs past the old courthouse. My lungs pushed for air as my leg muscles flexed strenuously. My heart beat faster than I\u2019d heard it beat in months. It was exhilarating. I almost felt alive.</p><p>My bright-blonde hair flew behind me like a white cape, flashing in the dark night. I pumped my arms harder and pushed myself. I fled for the safety of my home. The guards put there would stop them, the hounds of the darkness. The ground swirled with the darkness that always surrounded them.</p><p>I saw the street sign just as I heard their feet catching up and their breath nipping at my ears. I ran faster, pushing harder, but they too were fast. I almost winked, but instead, met the challenge. They had been made strong, just as I had been. I felt the guards grab me in time, just as one of the filthy dogs leapt at me.</p><p>I burst into a coughing laugh. I recovered from the excursion, bent over and smiling. I loved the feeling of my muscles in my legs contracting. \u201cYou filthy pups. You almost had me. Good job lads. Very excellent work. I won\u2019t forget that foot race for some time. Maybe next time, I\u2019ll wear bigger heels and I won't wink at all. That might give you a chance.\u201d I waved goodnight to the shadows pacing in the background, behind the wall of guards.</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ll have you, princess. We\u2019ll taste your dark blood soon.\u201d A dark and frankly daunting voice rode the wind above me. I pulled my sweater around myself as I curtsied. \u201cThe sun always wins, lads, and the north wind always loses. Goodnight, my fair princes.\u201d My heart seemed to be making a desperate attempt to slow itself down. I waved once again to the figures mulling around the road beyond me.</p><p>I walked up to the old house at the end of the road and opened the unlocked front door. In a city as busy as Portland, I had always told her she should lock the door. The old bat couldn\u2019t be bothered. She knew nothing in its right mind would ever attempt her front door. Except me. But I wasn\u2019t in my right mind, and we both knew that.</p><p>She sat in the old rocking chair looking millions of years old, smiling. \u201cTaunting your brothers of the night again?\u201d she cackled as only an old witch could.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah. I can't help myself.\"</p><p>\"Did you take a life?\"</p><p>\"I did. A girl's got to eat, you know?\u201d</p><p>Lydia smiled her old lady smile. \u201cYou could have some fruit like a normal girl. Maybe a steak.\u201d</p><p>I made a face. \u201cEwwww. Lydia, you know I\u2019m a vegetarian. Steak, yuck.\u201d</p><p>She laughed again as I walked to my bedroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lay back on my bed and relived the instant I pulled the soul from Peter. I imagined the freedom he felt. I imagined he flew away like a bird to discover whatever his imagination could muster. He had been a Fae man before he became a monster, and with his death, the man was truly free of the monster. I knew I had made the right choice. He had made the mistake of being with that woman and her kids. He would never have been able to control his inner beast. I knew I was justifying my actions, but I needed to. For longer than one of my slow heartbeats, I envied him and let a single tear drop from my left eye onto the bed. I looked over at the window and wondered where Shane was at that exact moment? I smiled and blew him a kiss.</p><p>No matter what, we were under the same moon.</p><p>I fell asleep with his smile in my mind.</p> <p>Epilogue</p><p>The dream was the same every time. The city stunk of decay and blood. Ruin was all around me. People were crying. In a panic, they all searched for their loved ones. A disaster had hit and destroyed it all in a moment. I searched for the one I\u2019d missed, the one who snuck through our system and had made the mess of everything.</p><p>I looked everywhere, but through all the pain and suffering, all I saw was his face.</p><p>Shane\u2019s.</p><p>He stood near to me, breathing me in. I wanted to touch him so badly. My dad\u2019s hands reached out to me, the same way the man on the train had done to the waitress. He was a knight in shining armor, there to save me by pulling me away from Shane. I stuck my hand out to take his hand just as I looked back at Shane. Suddenly I realized my dad was sticking his hand out to save Shane, and not me at all. I stepped closer to Shane and smiled at him. He smiled and melted all the pain and sorrow and loneliness.</p> <p>A woman screamed as I stood on my tiptoes and lifted my lips to meet his. As we kissed, the world shattered into a million pieces. I felt the warmth and realness of his face close to mine.</p><p>\u201cAimee, you have to wake up,\u201d the soft voice I knew so well whispered to me.</p><p>I woke startled. I felt my own embrace and the beads of sweat that soaked me. I had fallen asleep in my clothes again. I sat upright for a moment and pulled my sweater off. I felt the night air brush me. I looked around, dazed and expecting to see someone in the room with me. I had been certain a voice had woken me. I had been certain it was my mother.</p><p>Perhaps it had been her, finally trying to talk to me. Something about the dream always haunted me. I wished it would go away, but at least it allowed me to see his face, all their faces.</p><p>I rolled on my back, as I slipped off my jeans and pulled the blankets around me. The enveloping darkness was a warm comfort inside my bed.</p><p>I fell back to sleep, dreaming of him again.</p> <p>The End. </p> </body></html>"]
