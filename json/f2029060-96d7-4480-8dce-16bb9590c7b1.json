Failing that, an act of barbarous incivility.</p><p>By nature, Toby wasn\u2019t one to hold a grudge. As a gentleman of rank, wealth, and unarguable good looks, he\u2019d never received a slight he couldn\u2019t simply laugh off. He called every man friend, and no man enemy.</p><p>Until now.</p> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s him.\u201d Toby glared at the man twirling a fair-haired beauty across the gleaming parquet\u2014Benedict \u201cGray\u201d Grayson. The scoundrel who\u2019d stolen Toby\u2019s bride, his future, and his very respectability, then returned to a bloody hero\u2019s welcome.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him. Here, have a brandy.\u201d His host, Jeremy Trescott, the Earl of Kendall, extended a glass.</p><p>Toby accepted the drink and downed a quick, blistering swallow. \u201cI could call him out,\u201d he murmured behind the glass. \u201cI could call him out and shoot him dead tonight, in your garden.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You don\u2019t think I have it in me?\u201d Toby gave a bitter laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t you read the papers, Jem? That affable Sir Toby is a phantom of the past, and good riddance to him. Where did honor and decency get me, I ask you? Jilted, and replaced by a thieving, unprincipled bastard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGray\u2019s not a bastard. He\u2019s the legitimate nephew of a duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. And now a knight, as well. What isn\u2019t he? If you listen to the talk, Sir Benedict\u2019s a shipping financier, a West Indian planter, a feared privateer, a paragon of valor ...\u201d Toby shook his head. \u201cI know the truth. He\u2019s the thieving bastard who seduced my intended bride. It\u2019s within my rights to call him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you could do it,\u201d his friend said tersely, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to do it. This is Lucy\u2019s first ball. She\u2019s been planning it for months. If you turn it into scandal-sheet fodder, I\u2019ll take you into the garden and gut you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you didn\u2019t want scandal, you shouldn\u2019t have invited me. So long as I have the devil\u2019s own reputation, I might as well live up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ought to rise above it.\u201d Jeremy lowered his voice. \u201cListen, you\u2019re bound to meet with them at some point. Gray\u2019s bringing out his younger sister this year, and they\u2019ll be at every major social event. Best to make your public reconciliation now and quell the gossip. Why do you think Lucy and I planned a ball so early in the Season?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you waited a few months she\u2019d be too round?\u201d Eager to change the subject, Toby clapped his friend on the shoulder. He had no intention of reconciling with Grayson, publicly or otherwise. Ever. \u201cCongratulations, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know Lucy\u2019s with child?\u201d</p><p>Toby made eye contact with his friend\u2019s wife across the ballroom, as she weaved through the crush of guests. For years, Lucy Waltham Trescott had dogged their annual hunting excursions at Henry Waltham\u2019s estate. She\u2019d harbored a girlish infatuation for Toby but had forgotten him quickly enough when Jeremy captured her heart last autumn.</p><p>He said, \u201cI\u2019ve three older sisters, and ten nieces and nephews to date. I can tell. A woman\u2019s face gets a bit rounder, her hair shines. And her bosom, it...\u201d Jeremy shot him a glare, and Toby sipped his brandy. \u201cRight, well. I can just tell.\u201d</p><p>Lucy reached them, and Toby fortified his smile. He\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let this assembly catch him wearing any expression other than his usual rakish grin.</p><p>\u201cToby!\u201d Lucy exclaimed, taking his hands. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you, Luce.\u201d He gave her a sweeping gaze and an appreciative wink. The oncehoydenish twig of a girl had blossomed into the lovely, confident Countess of Kendall.</p><p>\u201cStunning. Most beautiful lady in the room.\u201d</p><p>Lucy made a dismissive wave of her hand, but behind the gesture she blushed to the ears. Just as he\u2019d known she would. Toby leaned in to kiss her cheek, ignoring Jeremy\u2019s forbidding glare.</p> <p>\u201cI know you say that to all the ladies,\u201d Lucy said. She gave him a cautious look. \u201cSophia looks well, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s radiant.\u201d Toby forced his grin wider as the Graysons waltzed by, Sophia\u2019s flaxen hair and porcelain complexion an elegant ivory blur. \u201cIncandescent, even. She has the look of a woman in love.\u201d</p><p>Sophia had never looked incandescent with him.</p><p>Lucy seemed to read his thoughts. She laid a hand on his sleeve. \u201cToby. You weren\u2019t in love with her, either.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. Lucy spoke the truth, but the truth didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. You\u2019ve got to move on.\u201d Jeremy nodded toward the crush of guests.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new Season, man. There\u2019s a fresh crop of debutantes just waiting to experience the renowned Sir Toby charm. Surely one of them has caught your eye.\u201d</p><p>Toby considered. True, a fresh conquest might provide a welcome diversion from murderous rage. He\u2019d always been a favorite with the debutantes. But lately, there was scarcely any challenge to it. His scandal-sheet notoriety as the \u201cRake Reborn\u201d had the mamas on alert and the young ladies in a flutter. All he had to do was appear.</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, there was one ... just one.\u201d Toby scanned the ballroom for a glimpse of vibrant emerald silk. There was only one lady who\u2019d caught his eye even briefly since he\u2019d made his entrance. He knew he\u2019d never seen her before\u2014he certainly wouldn\u2019t have forgotten her if he had.</p><p>Ah, there she was. An intriguing dark-haired beauty unlike any other lady in the room. Unlike any lady he\u2019d ever seen. Until now, he\u2019d caught only glimpses of her through the churning sea of dancers\u2014a flash of emerald, a cascade of raven hair, a swatch of honey-gold skin. Now she lined up with the ladies in preparation for a reel, and he had his first opportunity to study her in full view.</p><p>She was tall. Not nearly so tall as he, but taller than the ladies she stood amongst, and possessed of a lushly proportioned figure. The cut of her gown was modest, but she was the kind of woman who managed to look indecent, even fully clothed. Hers was a body plucked straight from some harem fantasy\u2014full breasts, flared hips, long legs. Toby watched as she favored her dance partner with the hint of a smile. That subtle curve of her lips was somehow more sensuous than any other curve of her body. Desire sparked through him, surprising him with its intensity. His whole body thrummed with that base, ineloquent instinct in which every seduction, no matter how suave, took its root: I want that.</p><p>Who was she? She was in her first Season, most certainly. With her beauty, she could not last more than a few months on the marriage mart\u2014even if her dowry were made up of cockleshells.</p><p>Toby shifted to view the row of gentlemen lined up opposite, to discern the identity of her partner. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be. She was partnered with Grayson, the thieving bastard. It wasn\u2019t enough he\u2019d already stolen the woman Toby had planned to marry\u2014now he had to strut and impress the debutantes, too? Damn it, they were Toby\u2019s territory. Now what had begun as vague, lustful inclination firmed into a plan:</p><p>I want that.</p><p>And I\u2019m going to take it.</p><p>\u201cFancy a reel, Luce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, I had not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for her answer, Toby took Lucy by the hand and tugged her onto the dance floor, wedging their way into the queued-up dancers just instants before the music began. He\u2019d positioned himself at Grayson\u2019s shoulder, and though he bowed to Lucy as the first chords were struck, he kept his gaze slanted toward the beauty in green silk beside her. The dance was one patterned in groups of three couples, requiring much interchange between adjacent partners, just as Toby had hoped. At regular intervals, he would have occasion to take his emerald-clad vision by the hand, exchange a few words, twirl her dizzy, and\u2014if all that failed to render her breathless\u2014flash his most winning smile.</p><p>But all in good time.</p><p>Winning over a lady was a matter of strategy, of patience. The first contact must not be skin-toskin, nor even glove-to-glove, but solely eye-to-eye. Toby moved forward to bow to her, his gaze riveted to hers. Her eyes were remarkable. Wide-set, almond-shaped, and fringed with sable lashes. So large and serious, they seemed to swallow up the rest of her face. For a moment, he let himself sink into those dark, placid pools.</p><p>He had a devil of a struggle fishing himself back out.</p><p>A few bars later, he was still recovering when the pattern compelled him to take her hand. He seized her gloved fingers firmly. The soft fabric heated between them as they circled, becoming warm and pliant as skin. Her bare flesh would feel like this, he thought. Satin-smooth. Supple. Hot to the touch as his hands glided under that cool silk to explore her every enticing curve. It would have the texture of cream against his tongue.</p><p>Lord. Toby hauled on his mental reins before those thoughts carried him away. Never before had he felt such a thrill simply taking a lady\u2019s hand. But then, never before had he seduced a woman straight from the arms of his enemy.</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d Lucy beckoned him with a twitch of her fingers, and Toby realized they\u2019d fallen behind in the pattern.</p><p>\u201cRight. Beg pardon.\u201d He leapt forward to claim Lucy\u2019s hands and sweep her down the dance.</p><p>\u201cAnd I apologize in advance, for what is about to occur.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flared. \u201cToby, no. You can\u2019t make a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I could. I could denounce Grayson and Sophia in front of the entire ballroom. Everyone thinks they\u2019re the golden couple, the freshly knighted hero and his beautiful, innocent bride? I could expose the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I could expose your innards.\u201d Lucy\u2019s fingernails dug into his arm, proving a fierce huntress still prowled within that elegant exterior. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare. I\u2019ve been planning this evening for months, Toby.\u201d</p><p>The dance parted them before Toby could respond. Then the lady in green silk smiled, and something in his chest pulled tight. He couldn\u2019t have spoken if he\u2019d tried. It was perfect, that smile, composed of full, sensuous lips the color of fine Madeira. Lips designed for sin, framing an innocent row of pearly teeth. And about the corners of her mouth, the slightest hint of melancholy\u2014just enough to intrigue the mind, stir the heart. Those lips defied mere admiration; they wanted a kiss.</p><p>There was only one thing wrong with that smile.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t directed at him. That bastard Grayson was its lucky recipient, and it was all Toby could do not to thrust out his boot and trip the man as he moved forward to take the beauty\u2019s hands.</p><p>Tempting, that idea\u2014but inconceivable. Toby might scuff his boot.</p><p>No, he would exact his revenge more subtly, more justly. No messy duel, no public denouncement. Did not the Bible advise an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth ... or, in this case, a lady for a lady?</p><p>When the pattern brought them together again, he pulled his dark-haired temptress close\u2014so close the green silk of her gown tangled with his legs. Her scent teased him: a crisp, freshsmelling blend of verbena and citrus. Tightening his grip on her arm, he whispered just as they parted: \u201cI must tell you a secret.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her fingers before releasing them, allowing his thumb to brush the sensitive center of her palm. He fancied he heard her gasp.</p><p>Grayson cast him a wary look. Toby\u2019s arrogance made a feast of it.</p><p>He turned back to the lady in green. \u201cYou will be shocked,\u201d he murmured as they brushed by one another again, \u201cbut it cannot be helped.\u201d</p><p>He did not imagine her gasp that time, nor the flush that bloomed from her hairline to her bosom. Lord, she had the most magnificent bosom, and now it was lifting slightly with her every breath, straining the seams of her bodice. Tearing his eyes from the sight was quite possibly the most difficult thing he\u2019d ever done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An eternity passed before the pattern reunited them. Toby dutifully twirled and promenaded, avoiding Lucy\u2019s inquisitive glances by watching her instead. Within him, bitter envy twined with lust. Admiration glowed on her face as she regarded her partner. He despised Grayson more every moment.</p><p>When at last he rejoined the lady in green, it was with profound, bone-deep relief. As though he\u2019d journeyed to the Holy Land and back to earn her favor, rather than circling a ballroom. If he\u2019d tried, he couldn\u2019t have explained the sense of purpose and destiny that gripped him. This jaunty reel had become a mission, more serious than any undertaking of his life. He kept up a low, seductive rush of words as they traced a tight spiral, denying her any opportunity to respond. \u201cI am drawn to you. I haven\u2019t taken my eyes from you all evening. I am enraptured.\u201d</p><p>He was a liar.</p> <p>Isabel Grayson trembled as she resumed her place in the line. Her heart pounded a wild rhythm, twice the tempo of the reel. Fortunately, the pattern now afforded her a few bars of rest. She ventured a furtive glance in the gentleman\u2019s direction, only to encounter the disquieting appraisal in his eyes.</p><p>Blushing, she dropped her gaze to the floor.</p><p>I am drawn to you, he\u2019d said. I haven\u2019t taken my eyes from you all evening. A lie, a lie. His eyes had most definitely not followed her all evening. If they had, Bel would have noticed\u2014for she\u2019d been staring at him the whole time.</p><p>How could she not stare? He was, quite simply, the most handsome man she\u2019d ever seen, despite the fact she\u2019d grown up in the company of three exceedingly handsome men: her father and two brothers. But their rugged, roguish appeal drew as much from their imperfections as from their well-formed features. By contrast, this man\u2014this man was an ideal. Sculpted profile, light brown hair threaded with gold, and a lean, confident grace to all his movements, grand or small.</p><p>She\u2019d observed him since the moment he entered the room. While he\u2019d circled the assembly with a lithe, easy step; as he\u2019d chatted with their hosts. Even when courtesy forced her to direct her eyes elsewhere, she\u2019d been aware of him, in some tingling notch at the base of her spine. And now, this dance. His bold glances, the stolen caresses, and those devastating murmured words: I am enraptured.</p> <p>Her whole body hummed with a foreign, forbidden thrill: desire.</p><p>Oh, this was a disaster!</p><p>Bel did not want to be feeling desire. She did not want to be feeling anything. Any other young lady in her place might dream of just this\u2014a divinely handsome man to sweep her away on a giddy tide of emotion.</p><p>But not her. She had come to this ball for one reason only: to select a husband from among the eligible lords. Her choice would be a wholly rational decision, made on the basis of reflection, prayer, and a well-informed portrait of the man\u2019s moral character and sphere of influence. In aid of the process, she knew that a measure of physical attraction on the gentleman\u2019s side would be beneficial; hence, this lavish, form-fitting gown. But for her part, Bel would not be influenced by capricious flutterings of sentiment, or worse\u2014by sinful stirrings of desire. And it must be desire, this plague of sensation rendering her feverish and lightheaded. It certainly felt sinful. And stirring.</p><p>\u201cYou dizzy me.\u201d</p><p>The words were a whisper as the pattern shifted and the handsome gentleman wove past. Reeling from an unwelcome frisson of pleasure, Bel missed a step.</p> <p>Her brother gave her a look of concern. \u201cCome now,\u201d Gray said, guiding her back into the pattern. \u201cDon\u2019t trust me to lead. You know I\u2019m just learning this country-dance nonsense myself.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t dare cease counting under my breath, or I\u2019ll lose my place completely.\u201d</p><p>Bel gave a nervous laugh and willed her molten-wax knees to solidify. Behave normally, she told herself. One, two, three. Dance, laugh, smile.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t smile.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d passed behind her again, that seductive phantom, trailing his serpentine whispers that wormed in through her ears and coiled low in her belly. And here he came once more.</p><p>\u201cWhen you smile, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear. This was not good. Not good at all.</p><p>She knew, because she was good. She was. She was a good, good girl. Not at all the type of lady to be tempted by a golden-haired, silver-tongued devil in fitted broadcloth. Yes, she\u2019d been raised by a degenerate father, a lunatic mother, and two brothers who had rebuilt the family fortune through violence and theft\u2014but Bel refused to follow that path. She\u2019d devoted her life to service and charity, although she\u2019d grown frustrated with the limits of her good work on Tortola. Visiting the infirm, teaching children to read, even supporting the sugar cooperative\u2014she was only sticking plasters on a rifle wound. She couldn\u2019t decrease unfair tariffs; she couldn\u2019t abolish slavery. The only people with the ability to effect meaningful change were here, in London: the lords, with their wealth and power and voices in government. Bel could not become one of them, but she could become one of the wealthy, powerful ladies at their sides.</p><p>It was a simple plan, really. She would marry a lord. She would become a lady of influence. And then she would make the world a better place. One, two, three. But first she must get through this dance without disgracing herself completely. The task was proving easier conceived than accomplished.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d the man whispered as they crossed paths again.</p><p>Right? What did he mean, right? Now irritation bubbled inside her. There was nothing right about his presumptive behavior. There was most certainly nothing right about the surreptitious touch that glanced off the base of her spine\u2014 there. A firm brush just above her left hip that had her startling, quivering, pivoting ...</p><p>Turning to the right.</p><p>\u201cThen left,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMind the feathers.\u201d</p><p>Bel turned to her left, ducking to avoid a sudden onslaught of ostrich plumes as she circled a dour-faced matron. Her mind whirled. He was helping her through the dance. It wasn\u2019t enough that he already had her intrigued, thrilled, angered, and just a little bit afraid. Now, to this stew of emotion inside her, he was adding gratitude.</p><p>He was making her like him.</p><p>\u201cNow back,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNicely done.\u201d</p><p>Oh, this just became worse and worse. They stood at rest again, and Bel felt his gaze burning over her skin. In a desperate effort to discourage him, she lifted her chin and shot the handsome stranger a haughty, quelling look.</p><p>In return, the man winked. Winked!</p><p>More distressed than ever, she averted her eyes. She should have known it wouldn\u2019t work. She had no talent whatever for haughtiness or quelling.</p><p>But she was an expert at following rules.</p><p>This dance had rules. A pattern. There was a right way to step, and a wrong way. The thought calmed her. If she adhered to the pattern, followed all the right steps, perhaps she could subdue this tempest of sensation within her\u2014all these inconvenient feelings stirred by a gentleman whose name she did not even know and whose fine profile she would never forget, should she live to the age of ninety-four.</p><p>Bel squared her shoulders. I have a mission, she reminded herself as she took her brother\u2019s hand and moved numbly through the pattern. Turning first left, then right, then releasing his hand to circle back round. I have a purpose, a cause.</p><p>\u201cYou have me utterly bewitched.\u201d</p><p>The words set her trembling anew. How did the man keep passing so close to her, so indecently near, without drawing attention?</p><p>Bel looked to her brother, whose forehead was wrinkled with concentration. As Gray danced, his lips moved ever so slightly. One, two, three ... He was too absorbed in the pattern to notice a thing.</p><p>Perhaps she ought to flee. Would it draw a great deal of attention, if she simply turned on her</p><p>heel and ran? She sighed. Of course it would. And as much as she hoped to draw society\u2019s attention, she didn\u2019t want to attract it that way. If she wanted to change the world, or even some small corner of it, these people must respect her and follow her example. Her comportment must be above reproach.</p><p>No, she could not flee. She must stay. She must follow the pattern of the dance. She must move toward this unnervingly handsome man and allow him to take her hand once again.</p><p>\u201cGive me a word.\u201d His hand slid up to clasp her arm just below the elbow. Just above her glove. His thumb stroked her bare flesh, and Bel quivered with exquisite fear. \u201cOne word.\u201d</p><p>Together they halted in the center of the dance. His eyes held her captive, warm copper alloyed with insistent steel. His voice was low, for only her ears. \u201cForgive me, but there is something between us. Some force I can no better explain than resist. I am faint with it, feverish. Give me a word. Tell me you feel it, too.\u201d</p><p>Bel made a feeble attempt to retract her arm, but his grip tightened, his thumb pressing against the racing pulse in the hollow of her elbow. She couldn\u2019t think what to do. There were no more thoughts in her head, only riotous, mad sensation pounding in her blood.</p><p>\u201cDo you? I beg of you, speak the truth.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. She was a good girl. A good, good girl.</p><p>She did not lie.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>\u201cThen you belong with me.\u201d</p><p>Toby slid one arm around his lady\u2019s waist, grasped her other hand in his, and danced her right off the parquet, twirling her toward the row of glass-paned doors that opened onto the terrace. They were almost to the door when that oaf Grayson finally looked up from his feet and noticed his partner had gone missing. He scanned his immediate circle in vain. The dancers around him stopped, their bemusement certain to become amusement soon enough. With a laugh, Toby swept his temptress and her yards of green silk straight out into the night. Now there was a story the ton would remember, when the names Sir Toby Aldridge and Sir Benedict Grayson bumped against one another in conversation. Grayson might have eloped with Toby\u2019s intended bride, but now Toby had stolen an admirer straight from Grayson\u2019s own arms.</p><p>He could not call it complete revenge, but he could call it a solid beginning. And now, he could turn his attention to the gorgeous creature he held in his arms. Could it possibly have been just minutes he\u2019d been yearning for this embrace? It felt like years. A lifetime. Or here, in this Greek-styled colonnade, he could imagine it an eternity. It was as though an enchantment had been cast around them, binding them together with some primeval, pagan magic.</p><p>\u201cRemarkable,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She froze in his arms, though she made no attempt to pull away. The rush of cool night air surrounding them only emphasized the heat building between their bodies.</p><p>\u201cWhat, precisely, is remarkable?\u201d Her voice was melodic, and flavored with some foreign spice.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he answered honestly. \u201cDo you realize, your hair is actually a shade darker than the night sky?\u201d He wound a jet-black tendril around his finger, enjoying the way her lower lip quivered in invitation. Oh yes, he was in fine form tonight. \u201cAnd softer than moonlight. How is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cDear heavens. You do this often, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweep ladies onto secluded terraces and pay them nonsensical compliments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... perhaps,\u201d he said, chastened.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she echoed. Her look went from one of skepticism to one of dismay.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret, darling. With you, I actually mean them.\u201d Toby gave her his most disarming grin\u2014</p><p>that lopsided, mischievous boyish smile he\u2019d honed on a mother and three older sisters, then polished to a seductive gleam. It was a grin that said, I know I\u2019m impossible, but it\u2019s useless to resist. We both know you can\u2019t help but love me.</p><p>Except\u2014evidently, this lady could. Her look of dismay became one of despair. She swallowed, then released a flurry of words. \u201cPlease tell me you are a lord.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Toby\u2019s involuntary burst of laughter increased the distance between them. \u201cA lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuke, marquess, earl, viscount, baron ...\u201d Her eyes were grave and pleading. \u201cPlease tell me you hold one of those titles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to disappoint you, but the arms holding you belong to a baronet. I\u2019m not a lord, but a sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d She pushed away from him, flinging her hands wide. The exasperated cry she made, the dramatic gesture\u2014so unreservedly passionate, so deliciously un-English. What other cries of passion might she produce, if expertly provoked? A man could not help but wonder.</p> <p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d She leaned against a marble column, framing her brow with her fingertips. \u201cNot a lord, but a sir. And a rake, to top it. This... this is a disaster.\u201d Her accent grew more pronounced as her agitation increased, her vowels tilting at interesting angles. Toby was almost too enthralled to take offense.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cA disaster?\u201d he repeated. \u201cSurely it isn\u2019t so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch behavior ... such impropriety. I\u2019ll never find a suitable husband now. What honorable man would have me?\u201d She dropped her hands and looked up at him. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t possibly marry you.\u201d</p><p>And that timeless, pagan enchantment? Popped like a soap bubble.</p> <p>Toby was tempted to point out that he didn\u2019t recall proposing anything, and that the notion of marrying her had not even formed in his mind. But neither of those facts mitigated the innumerable insults contained in her declaration. \u201cLet me understand you. You couldn\u2019t possibly marry me, because I am neither a lord, nor even suitable, nor do I qualify\u2014by your estimation\u2014as an honorable man.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair, muttering, \u201cRight, well. Doesn\u2019t that sum up public opinion nicely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry. I\u2019m not thinking. You ... you make it so I can\u2019t think at all.\u201d She turned and paced away from him. \u201cI must go back inside. I\u2019m a waste of silk, standing out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the contrary,\u201d Toby said, enjoying the sight of her nubile form in motion. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re putting that silk to excellent use.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a horrified look as she moved for the door. \u201cI must return, before my reputation is completely destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He caught her arm. She couldn\u2019t go back inside yet, not before everyone noticed their absence. What sort of revenge would that be? He made his voice soothing. \u201cPlease, calm down. Truly, you\u2019ve done nothing so scandalous. You merely became dizzied by the dancing and the closeness of the room, and I\u2019ve brought you outside for some fresh air.\u201d He tugged her over to a bench and motioned for her to sit. \u201cNow, what you need is a bit of refreshment. Allow me to bring you a glass of champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I never take spirits, not even medicinally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLemonade, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, thank you.\u201d Her hands fluttered in her lap. \u201cYou know I am not truly ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d He crouched before her. \u201cI distinctly remember you trembling. I told you I felt faint, feverish. You said you felt the same.\u201d It didn\u2019t seem possible that her eyes could widen any further, but widen they did. \u201cYou must have been ill. God knows, the attentions of an unsuitable, dishonorable, lowly baronet could not possibly bring you to such a state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are teasing me.\u201d The words were an accusation, spoken in a wounded tone. As though teasing were an offense tantamount to stealing bread from beggars. \u201cAnd we shouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in hiding. Anyone could come by at any moment.\u201d Toby tilted his head toward a cluster of guests down the colonnade. \u201cAnd a few minutes in a secluded corner with me are hardly a barrier to marrying well. Just ask half the ladies in that ballroom.\u201d</p><p>She turned a puzzled glance toward the glass-paned doors and the colorful blur of dancers beyond them. \u201cReally, I should be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said, scrubbing the teasing tone from his voice. He needed her to trust him. He needed her to stay. \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to fear from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an unmarried woman with a reputation to guard, and you are clearly the worst sort of rake.\u201d She touched a hand to the lone ornament she wore: a slender gold pendant in the shape of a cross. \u201cI have everything to fear from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you been reading that nonsense in The Prattler?\u201d Toby rose to his feet. \u201cMy dear, don\u2019t believe everything you read in the papers. You ought to thank me for whisking you out of that ballroom and rescuing you from your partner\u2014now there\u2019s a true scoundrel. That Grayson\u2019s the one you ought to fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d She shook her head, her black curls inky against the gleaming marble. \u201cWhy should I fear my own brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ...\u201d He stepped back, stared at her. \u201cYour brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my brother.\u201d</p><p>Toby returned to a crouch before her. He braced his hands on the bench, one on either side of her skirts, and stared hard into those dark, solemn eyes. \u201cTell me your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Isabel Grayson. I thought everyone knew. True, we\u2019ve only just arrived from Tortola, but the gossip ...\u201d Toby bent his head, and her tone sharpened. \u201cAre you laughing?\u201d</p><p>When his shoulders stopped shaking, he wiped a tear from the corner of his eyes. What an ass he was, congratulating himself on his revenge. Drawing a lady\u2019s eye from her own brother, what a triumph. \u201cMiss Isabel Grayson. Good God,\u201d he said, laughter quaking his chest anew.</p><p>\u201cHave you any idea who I am?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her eyebrows. \u201cOther than a baronet? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sir Toby Aldridge.\u201d</p><p>He waited for recognition to dawn in her eyes. He waited in vain.</p><p>\u201cSir Toby Aldridge,\u201d he repeated. Still nothing but blank indifference. \u201cDid Sophia\u2014Did Lady Grayson never speak of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. Should she have?\u201d</p><p>Toby flinched inwardly. How quickly she\u2019d forgotten him. \u201cNo, I suppose there is no real reason she should. And you don\u2019t read The Prattler? \u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI abhor it. I despise rumor and innuendo, though it seems these people think of little else.\u201d She waved toward the ballroom\u2014another of those expansive, impassioned gestures. \u201cThese are the leaders of government and society, yet they seem hopelessly shallow. Children starve in the streets, free men live in chains\u2014but their attention is absorbed with illicit liaisons, marital disputes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroken engagements,\u201d Toby added bitterly. \u201cElopements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, precisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevolting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He clucked his tongue. \u201cInsupportable. I\u2019m quite weary of scandal myself.\u201d</p><p>She perked with enthusiasm, a pretty flush warming her complexion. \u201cDo you know, I\u2019ve been in London over a month. I\u2019ve attended dinners and card parties, my brother\u2019s f\u00eate, and this ball. I\u2019ve heard ever so many words from these people\u2019s mouths, and all of it scandal and nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this disappoints you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d There went her vowels again, lilting and stretching. \u201cIt seems no one has any ideas or opinions worth the breath to speak them aloud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you, Miss Grayson? Something tells me you are full to bursting with ideas and opinions. Not only worth your breath to speak them aloud, but worth the silence of others, to be heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her lashes trembled. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>Such wonderment in her voice, as if he\u2019d divined the very key to her soul. No, he\u2019d done nothing so impressive. He\u2019d merely paraphrased what he knew to be every girl\u2019s desire: someone willing to listen.</p><p>Toby was a very good listener.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I come from a family rife with opinionated females.\u201d He felt himself sinking back into those wide, dark eyes, and there he perceived an inner depth to rival her fathomless gaze. Not every girl had that. \u201cI know an intelligent, principled woman when I meet with one.\u201d</p><p>Blushing deeper, she looked away. God, she truly was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cFeeling feverish and faint again?\u201d he teased. \u201cI know I am.\u201d</p><p>A smile pulled at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Don\u2019t smile. You\u2019ll kill me. I stop breathing when you smile.\u201d Those sensuous lips curved wide, and all teasing aside, Toby\u2019s heart gave his lungs a deflating kick. The irony did not escape him that here sat the sole lady in London who had no knowledge of his recent jilting, nor his outrageous reputation. The only lady who would not regard him as her entr\u00e9e into the scandal sheets, or a delicious brush with infamy. With her, he could simply be his old, carefree self.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized, until this moment, how much he\u2019d missed that. Just one more thing Grayson had stolen from him. How the same parents had produced both that scoundrel and this angel, Toby couldn\u2019t comprehend.</p><p>A thought struck him. Smacked him, really, with all the force of a brick. Of course. This was Grayson\u2019s sister. If he wanted an opportunity to exact revenge, well then ...</p><p>Here she sat.</p><p>Good God, he could\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou could what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Had he said that aloud? Damn. \u201cI could ...\u201d</p><p>I could seduce you. I could take your virtue. I could live up to my infamous reputation and make you a public scandal. I could refuse to marry you and leave you heartbroken and ruined, with no prospects. I could take all your brother\u2019s hopes for your future and dash them just as thoroughly as he destroyed my own.</p><p>\u201cI could ...\u201d His voice trailed off again as he stared into those wide, lovely, innocent eyes. No. No, he really couldn\u2019t.</p><p>It simply wasn\u2019t in him, no matter what the papers said. And if the only respect left to him was his self-respect, Toby would cling to it. Grayson had already taken his bride and his reputation. He\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d surrender his last shreds of honor, too.</p><p>Besides, he liked this girl. She deserved better treatment than that.</p><p>\u201cI could escort you back inside now,\u201d he said at length. \u201cOr fetch our hostess, if you prefer. Or perhaps you\u2019ve changed your mind and would like some refreshment?\u201d Smiling, he covered her gloved hand with his. \u201cCan I be of no service to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there is a way you can help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, my lady.\u201d He knelt at her feet, mimicking a gesture of fealty. \u201cYou\u2019ve only to say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Toby,\u201d she whispered, her fingers clutching his. \u201cFind me a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA husband?\u201d He cocked his head slightly and quirked one eyebrow. \u201cYou want me ... to find you ... a husband?\u201d</p><p>Bel\u2019s stomach flipped. In some unjust, inexplicable way, confusion rendered him even more handsome. If she did not recall her priorities quickly, she was in danger of forgetting them altogether. \u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cA husband. Tonight, if possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhat a mission you\u2019re setting me. You\u2019re determined to net a husband this very evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do not expect a proposal tonight. But I would like to identify a suitable candidate for marriage. Why else would I attend a ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. To enjoy yourself, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo enjoy myself?\u201d Bel suddenly realized she was still holding his hand. She released it abruptly.</p><p>She had not thought herself the sort of woman who would be susceptible to seductive, charming rakes... but here she was with one. Alone. On a darkened terrace. The warmth of his skin still dancing on her fingertips ...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not such a preposterous suggestion,\u201d he said. \u201cThese events are typically considered enjoyable, I believe.\u201d He rose from his knee and sat on the bench next to her\u2014too close for Bel\u2019s comfort. The masculine scent of his cologne surrounded her, intrigued her. Oh, dear. She could close her eyes to his handsome face, but how could she block out his scent? Much less close her ears to his rich, soothing voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome now,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you honestly tell me you have not enjoyed yourself at all this evening?\u201d</p><p>She wilted in silence. They both knew she could not.</p><p>He inched closer on the bench. \u201cI know I\u2019m finding the night more enjoyable by the minute.\u201d</p> <p>Not good, not good at all. Bel shot to her feet. \u201cI have but one purpose in attending this ball,\u201d</p><p>she insisted as much to herself as to him, \u201cand that is to find a husband. I must marry a lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must marry a lord?\u201d he echoed from the bench. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. Your brother\u2019s bartering you for connections? I would believe it of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d She briefly wondered how Sir Toby had formed such an ill opinion of her brother, when Sir Benedict Grayson was London\u2019s current cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Evidently he did pay little heed to rumor. \u201cDolly has given me an obscenely large dowry, expressly so I might select a husband without regard to title or fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDolly?\u201d Sir Toby chuckled.</p> <p>Bel cringed at her mistake. She knew her brother hated the pet name, but how could she erase her habit from girlhood? \u201cShortened from Adolphus, his middle name. I know everyone calls him Gray. At any rate, Gray wishes me to marry for love, as he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. As he did.\u201d</p><p>Did she detect bitterness in his tone?</p><p>\u201cMarrying a lord is my own wish,\u201d she rushed on. \u201cNot just any lord, mind, but a worthy one. A man of honor and principle.\u201d She gestured toward the ballroom full of elegant guests. \u201cBut how can I discern a gentleman\u2019s moral character in this setting? Dancing, cards, gossip, and drink\u2014a ball is all vice, and no virtue.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to Sir Toby, who was wearing his becoming expression of puzzlement once again. \u201cI\u2019ve only recently arrived in England, but you have lived among these people all your life. You know their titles, their characters, their spheres of influence. So long as you\u2019ve spirited me out onto the terrace, you can assist me in identifying a suitable match.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her intently. It seemed an age before he finally spoke. \u201cYou have the most intriguing accent. I can\u2019t place it at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy ... my accent? My mother was Spanish. She was our father\u2019s second wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. That explains it, then.\u201d</p><p>Still he stared at her. Bel grew self-conscious. \u201cIs it so hideous to the ear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. I find it enchanting. I could listen to you all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Now \u201cself-conscious\u201d did not begin to describe her state. Heat built low in her belly, melting her center of gravity. She felt unsteady on her feet. \u201cSo, will you help me?\u201d</p><p>He rose from the bench. She had not remembered him being so tall.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wish to marry for love?\u201d he said.</p><p>Bel swallowed hard as he approached.</p> <p>\u201cEverything about you\u2014your voice, your gestures, your opinions ... even the way you dance. So passionate.\u201d He reached out, brushing the backs of his knuckles against the bare flesh of her arm. \u201cSo warm. And yet, you would choose a husband in this cold, calculated manner? For a title and status? It hardly seems in your nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would presume to know my nature? I am not\u2014\u201d She stiffened. She could not claim to be without passion. That would be a lie.</p><p>She continued, \u201cIf I have passion, it is for God. If I marry for love, it is for love of His children in their hour of need. From my father and brother, I am burdened with this ill-gotten dowry, gold tainted with blood. From my mother, I inherit this.\u201d She swept an impatient gesture down her curvaceous form. \u201cHow can I live with myself, if I barter those advantages for my own pleasure, or for something so transitory as romantic love? No, I will redeem them instead\u2014by trading them for a title and status, as you say. For the opportunity to do good.\u201d</p><p>She shut her eyes and took a deep, steadying breath. Sir Toby didn\u2019t deserve her anger. After all, he was right. Her mother\u2019s unpredictable passions did simmer in her blood, and something about this man brought them to a boil.</p><p>Perhaps she had been born with a fiery nature, but she also had the choice to control it. As her mother\u2019s example proved, wild, emotional outbursts did not earn a woman respect or influence. They earned her a padlocked room, and years of derision and neglect.</p><p>\u201cPlease forgive me,\u201d she said, once she\u2019d banked her inner fire. \u201cIt\u2019s just... What can you know of my nature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it is human.\u201d He gave her a little smile that only stoked the flames. \u201cAnd I know it will be some undeserving man\u2019s great fortune to explore.\u201d</p><p>Without giving her time to respond\u2014not that Bel had any coherent response to make\u2014he linked his arm with hers and steered her toward the windows. \u201cWell, then. Let us begin our search for Lord Honorable.\u201d After a moment, he said, \u201cAh. I\u2019ve spotted an earl who is, by all accounts, a very excellent man and a respected landlord, if a bit stern in his demeanor. Impeccable aristocratic lineage, pots of money, and a burgeoning political career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, he sounds ideal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s just one snag, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Sir Toby smiled down at her. \u201cLord Kendall is already married, to Lucy.\u201d</p><p>With a cry of reproach, Bel attempted to withdraw her arm from his. He had already tightened his grip, in anticipation of just such a retreat.</p><p>She asked, \u201cWhy must you insist on teasing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are in dire need of it, my dear. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll learn to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall not.\u201d She was, however, learning to enjoy the warm press of his arm against hers, the solid support it afforded her. Charming devil of a man. \u201cSurely there are other honorable lords in the assembly, apart from our host. Other gentlemen with burgeoning political careers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s political acumen you seek, look no further. Here we have Lord Markham, the renowned orator.\u201d He directed her attention toward a lean, silver-haired gentleman. A great deal older than she, Bel thought, but perhaps his maturity boded well for her purpose.</p><p>\u201cIs he very influential?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, very. Legislation passes and fails on the wave of feeling generated by his speeches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Bel perked. This Lord Markham sounded promising.</p><p>\u201cYes, I understand he was instrumental in turning the majority against the abolition bill a few years back.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cThen he will not do at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you sought political clout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but it must be in aid of justice, not oppression. That is my entire design in marrying a lord\u2014to further charitable causes as a lady of influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lady of influence.\u201d He gave her an amused look. \u201cOver society? Or over a well-connected husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdeally, both.\u201d Bel rued the blush warming her cheeks. It had nothing to do with shame over her motives, and everything to do with the way he brushed aside a strand of hair that had fallen over her brow. So casually, as if it were the most natural thing in the world for him to do. Her brow tingled where his skin had grazed hers.</p><p>\u201cI see. So all this time we have been searching for Lord Honorable, when the man you truly seek is Lord Malleable.\u201d She attempted to protest, but he interrupted. \u201cLord Whittlesby would be an excellent candidate. He\u2019s a marquess, recently widowed. Rather stolid sort of man. A member of my club, though I never see him in his cups or sitting down to cards. His opinions are rarely solicited when conversation turns to matters of politics. He mostly speaks of puddings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuddings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Great connoisseur of puddings, Whittlesby. Goes on and on about them.\u201d He drew her close and turned her toward the window. \u201cHe\u2019s just there. By the potted palm.\u201d</p><p>Bel followed the line of his arm. There, by the aforementioned palm, stood a squat, balding man spooning custard from a flute. She watched as he withdrew a linen square from his breast pocket and proceeded to wipe first his mouth, then his glistening pate.</p><p>\u201cAn influential title, and possessed of opinions easily influenced,\u201d Sir Toby said. \u201cSurely you can find no cause to reject him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ... why, he\u2019s shorter than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not realize your definition of \u2018upstanding\u2019 encompassed actual physical stature. Must I add \u2018tall\u2019 to the list of qualifications, then? And handsome, as well? This task you\u2019ve set me becomes more and more difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine looks are of little importance,\u201d she replied, irritated with herself for her petty remark. \u201cAs is stature. Beauty of character is often at odds with physical appearance. A tall, handsome man may very well make the least desirable husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. You ruled me out some minutes ago, remember? I\u2019ve everything against me. Tall. Handsome.\u201d He pulled a face and made a dramatic shiver. \u201cNot a lord,\u201d he repeated, mimicking her accent, \u201cbut a lowly sir. This is a disaster.\u201d</p><p>This time Bel succeeded in wrenching her arm away. \u201cI did apologize. And I never used the word \u2018lowly.\u2019 My own brother is a sir, and I know him to be the equal of any duke.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cHow very loyal of you. But if that be the case, then why are you so set on marrying a lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor his influence in Parliament, of course. Knights and baronets have no seats in the House of Lords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParliament has two houses, darling. Don\u2019t neglect the House of Commons. That\u2019s where all social debate and progressive bills originate, before Markham and his followers shout them down. Perhaps it\u2019s an MP you ought to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre MPs more honorable, as a rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. This is government, my dear.\u201d He shook his head, chuckling. \u201cYou are like Diogenes with his lantern, roaming the earth in search of an honest man. Admittance to the House of Commons is only marginally more selective than that of the penny theater. Anyone with a few thousand pounds to spare might buy himself a rotten borough, and the fairly elected members are largely chosen out of habit or by default.\u201d</p><p>At his description, Bel suffered a pang of disappointment. She had hoped to marry an honorable, principled man with a seat in Parliament. A man for whom she could feel... not passion or love, but perhaps friendship, and a temperate sort of esteem. But what if that man simply didn\u2019t exist? She\u2019d have to settle for one like Whittlesby, she supposed. She caught sight of the cream-puffed, balding lord through the window and stared at him long and hard, taking careful assessment of her emotions.</p><p>Nothing. He stirred nothing within her, save a mild flutter that resembled indigestion. Sir Toby continued, \u201cWhy, even I could secure a seat in Commons whenever I wished. Lowly,</p><p>disastrous, unsuitable sir that I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said those things,\u201d she argued. \u201cI would never say such things, and it pains me to be accused of them. Kindly stop twisting my words.\u201d</p><p>He inched closer to her. \u201cWhich words am I twisting? I clearly remember hearing \u2018disaster,\u2019</p><p>and a pursuant discussion of my unsuitability.\u201d He chucked her under the chin, and his thumb lingered on the edge of her jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not one to hold a grudge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you tease me so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, as I said, you need teasing. You\u2019re taking yourself so seriously. Too seriously. It\u2019s a grave condition, solemnity. Causes ill humor, indigestion. And it\u2019s bad for the complexion. Teasing\u2019s one of two proven remedies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of two?\u201d Bel sighed. \u201cIf you\u2019re so concerned for my complexion, may I implore you to switch to the other?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand framed her jaw. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>And then his lips were on hers.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Oh.</p> <p>She was being kissed. Kissed, for the first time in her life, in a moonlit colonnade, by a man with the beauty of a Greek god and the morality of a satyr. It was everything right and everything wrong all at once, and Bel didn\u2019t know what to make of it. She was so used to placing actions in one category or the other.</p><p>She was too shocked to move, so she just\u2014stood still.</p><p>His lips brushed over hers in a series of slow, teasing caresses. Tender, gentle ... extending every invitation but making no demands. She caught the unmistakable scent of brandy on his breath\u2014a familiar aroma, but an as yet untested flavor. She never took spirits, and here this man\u2019s lips were giving Bel her first taste of sin. It savored of fire. Not bitter, as she\u2019d always imagined it would taste, but raw and potent. The flavor opened all her senses, awakened her entire body to the light pressure of his mouth against hers, the gentle stirrings of the breeze around them, the spar of whalebone pressing between her breasts.</p><p>She felt everything.</p><p>He whispered something against her mouth, something Bel could not hear through the roar of blood pounding in her ears\u2014but she felt it, rushing over her lips. His hand slid from her jaw to the back of her neck, tilting her head to meet his. And now he kissed her again, more firmly this time, his lips slightly parted as they covered hers. Once more, the flavor of brandy flooded her senses, intoxicating and dark.</p> <p>She might have pulled away at any moment. But she didn\u2019t. She remained still, so still as his thumb traced a lazy circle over her pulse. She did not move. She dared not breathe. But inside, her blood danced. A frenzied, pagan dance that resembled a minuet like a tropical hurricane resembled the London fog. Heat whirled in her center and spiraled out to her limbs, pulsing to a furious beat. The rhythm called to her, pulled her consciousness inward with insistent tugs\u2014until she followed it, sinking deep, deep into the heart of herself. Here was passion ... desire ... wild, untamed emotion.</p><p>Here was the enemy of all her hopes and dreams.</p><p>And yet\u2014he was the one to retreat.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The syllable escaped her lips the instant his pulled away. He stared down at her, so divinely handsome, clearly anticipating her further response. But what more was there to say?</p><p>She could not reproach him, when any fault was just as much hers as his. A taste lingered on her lips, that warm elixir of brandy and desire. Bel pressed her lips together to savor it a moment longer.</p><p>Soon they would have to go back inside. She would piece together her wits and refresh her composure and find herself a husband. A man who would offer her wealth and influence but hold no influence over her. A man who didn\u2019t stir her blood with a wink or a smile, who would pose no threat to her principles. A man who tasted of custard, not brandy and fire. Someone safe.</p> <p>When she swept back through those doors, Bel would regain control of her emotions and refocus on her goals. But for these few stolen moments, in the arms of this charming devil...</p><p>all rational thought was lost. Her soul belonged to him.</p><p>She closed her eyes, to remain in the darkness. If only a moment could last forever. If only he would kiss her again.</p><p>Well, Toby thought, he wouldn\u2019t be trying that again.</p><p>So much for curing her solemnity with a kiss. She still carried the weight of the world on that lovely brow, while he ... he seemed to have contracted a deathly case of serious. The night felt darker now; vast and humbling. He couldn\u2019t have made a joke if he\u2019d tried. And that kiss had left him too breathless to tease.</p><p>He\u2019d kissed her. How had that happened? Hadn\u2019t he just decided not to pursue her?</p><p>No. He\u2019d decided not to ruin her as a means of revenge. And somewhere between that moment and this one, he\u2019d decided to kiss her, simply for her. It had been lovely. Damn near magical. He couldn\u2019t regret it.</p><p>Still, he said, \u201cI think we had better go back inside.\u201d</p> <p>He slid his hand down the slope of her shoulder for one last caress, and her eyes fluttered open.</p><p>Blast. Now he\u2019d done it.</p><p>Toby recognized the dazzled look in those eyes. He knew it all too well. Charming young ladies was his singular talent, and he\u2019d developed it through years of practice. He knew the precise instant he had them. When they took all their youthful hopes and romantic dreams and shaped them into a tight little ball and tossed it into his hands. Here, they said. Take my heart and break it.</p><p>Normally, Toby was happy to oblige. What was that line in the novel his sister Augusta loved so well? \u201cA girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.\u201d Truer words were never penned. He took that ball of hopes and dreams, made a little show of juggling it, and handed it back\u2014a bit dented, perhaps, but largely intact. Occasionally, he misjudged and the ball slipped from his grasp to shatter on the floor. But even then, the young ladies recovered quickly enough.</p><p>Because they always held something back. This little plaything they tossed him\u2014it held the affections of a girl. Their true womanly hearts, their deepest passion and love, this they guarded, saved for another man. Anyone who labeled Toby a heartbreaker underestimated the shrewdness of feminine intellect. He knew, from years of experience, that young women were a great deal wiser than general opinion would allow.</p><p>There was something different about this woman, however\u2014aside from her enchanting accent and strident politics. When he\u2019d kissed her, she\u2019d offered him nothing\u2014but neither had she held anything in reserve. She didn\u2019t know how to flirt. None of his compliments or teasing had warmed her a single degree, but in that moment when their lips met ... she\u2019d simply been his. With her, there could be no half-measures.</p><p>That kiss had rocked him to his boots.</p><p>His blood was still fizzing with her nearness, her scent, her taste. Her skin was so smooth; the edge of temptation, keen. And just when he\u2019d nearly lost himself in those dark, serious eyes, she pursed her delicious lips and whispered ...</p><p>\u201cWhittlesby.\u201d</p><p>Toby blinked. Had he truly just heard her say\u2014</p><p>\u201cLord Whittlesby.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cWhen we go back inside, will you introduce us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014\u201d The breath rushed out of him in an indefinable question. He released her, cleared his throat, and tried again. \u201cWh\u2014\u201d</p><p>No use. He didn\u2019t even know how to complete that syllable. Who? What? Why? When?</p><p>Yes, that was it\u2014when? When did my amatory prowess sink to this low, where I might kiss a young lady on a moonlit terrace and the first thought that springs to her mind is ...</p><p>\u201cWhittlesby\u201d?</p><p>\u201cWhittlesby?\u201d he finally echoed, somehow hoping he\u2019d misheard her. Twice.</p><p>\u201cYes. You did promise to find me a husband. I\u2019ve decided he will do.\u201d</p><p>A burst of shocked laughter escaped him. \u201cNo. No, you\u2019ve misunderstood. Whittlesby will not do at all.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThen you won\u2019t introduce me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sooner die.\u201d Indeed, some small part of his pride was withering to dust as he spoke. But this was nothing, compared to the agonies he would suffer, surrendering this vibrant, intelligent, beautiful woman to a lump like Whittlesby.</p><p>Good God. Whittlesby?</p><p>\u201cBut you promised to find me a husband.\u201d She latched a hand over his wrist. \u201cTonight.\u201d</p><p>The pressure of her fingers did strange things to his pulse. He teetered on the verge of taking her into his arms and kissing her again\u2014thoroughly, this time. All night long, if need be. Until he kissed away her memory of any man but him.</p><p>Honor, he reminded himself sternly. And something about clinging to the few remaining shreds of it. The honorable course, sadly, did not involve kissing those perfect lips all night\u2014</p><p>but neither did it mean sending her into the arms of a perfect clod. He needed to set this girl straight. Only then, not before, he would let her go.</p><p>The first strains of a waltz reached his ears. \u201cYes, I promised to find you a husband. And so I shall\u2014inside.\u201d Where the light of a hundred candles would hold this feral temptation at bay.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said, tucking her gloved hand into the crook of his arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a lesson about the true nature of influence and the selection of worthy suitors.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a puzzled look.</p><p>He clarified, \u201cWe are going to dance.\u201d</p><p>He led her back inside and had her swept up in the waltz before anyone could notice their return.</p><p>She was an inexperienced dancer, he could tell\u2014she couldn\u2019t have had much opportunity to practice on that speck of a tropical island. But still, they glided through the room effortlessly, in perfect time with the music. Because Toby was an excellent dancer, and she gave herself over completely to his lead.</p><p>\u201cYou dance like a dream,\u201d he told her. His dream, likely tonight. Perhaps for weeks to come.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019ve never been fond of dancing, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...?\u201d</p><p>She released a sigh scented with brandy and resignation. \u201cBut I\u2019m enjoying dancing with you.\u201d</p><p>Well, praise God for small victories.</p><p>\u201cMiss Grayson,\u201d he said, feigning shock, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re enjoying yourself. And at a ball?\u201d When she blushed, he murmured, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your secret is safe with me. But only if you make me a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of promise?\u201d she asked, giving him a guarded look.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you will not marry Whittlesby. Not him, nor anyone like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll promise you nothing of the kind. Who are you, to tell me whom I should and should not marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho am I?\u201d He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m the gentleman you charged with finding you a suitable husband. Whittlesby and his ilk are categorically unsuitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand. I have goals, priorities.\u201d She looked to the ceiling. \u201cI wish to become a lady of influence. It\u2019s the only way to have any measurable effect on society. If I do not marry above my rank, I may as well remain unmarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do not marry your true equal, you will regret it the rest of your life. Listen to me, Isabel.\u201d</p><p>His use of her Christian name startled her. Good. Now she was paying attention. Plus, he liked saying it.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, you are intelligent. You are young and idealistic and brimming with passion. You don\u2019t lack for fortune or family. And you\u2019re the most intriguing, beautiful woman in the room. That arsenal of persuasion could bring the whole of London to its knees, if judiciously applied. For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t chain yourself to some pudding with a title. The power you seek\u2014it already resides within you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, spare me your nonsensical flattery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause you might start to enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>She set her jaw and stared stubbornly over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not speaking nonsense, Isabel. It\u2019s the most rational thing in the world.\u201d Toby shook his head. How could he make her see? \u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cImagine true disaster were to strike. Imagine you found yourself married to me. A lowly, dishonorable, too-handsome sir, unsuitable in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said lowly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he teased. \u201cBut you blush so prettily each time you protest. My point is this\u2014if it\u2019s influence you seek, there are any number of ways to achieve it. Even by allying yourself with such a hopeless case as me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer, ostensibly to whisper in her ear. But he could not help but enjoy the rustle of silk against his boots and the swell of her ample bosom brushing his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t make a show of looking,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut everyone in this room is staring at you. Can you imagine why?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you are holding me indecently close? Because we have just emerged from an illicit interlude on the verandah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. We are the latest scandal.\u201d</p><p>She went rigid in his arms.</p> <p>\u201cNow don\u2019t distress yourself, darling. Sometimes a little scandal is just what you need. Never underestimate the power of rumor and innuendo. At this moment, we are the object of intense speculation\u2014the infamous rake of the scandal sheets, paired with the newly arrived innocent. They\u2019re all desperate to know what we\u2019re whispering to one another. Tomorrow, they\u2019re asking themselves, what will be the headline? Am I ruining you? Or are you reforming me?\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he fanned his fingers across the small of her back. \u201cWhat a story that would be for The Prattler. Your name would be on the lips of every gossip in Town.\u201d</p><p>Finally, her mouth curved a fraction. \u201cYes, I can imagine it would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see? Isabel, you are free to marry where you choose, without regard to fortune or rank. Even if the unthinkable occurred, and you were wed to a lowly blighter like me\u201d\u2014he silenced her protest with a wink\u2014\u201cyou would still be a lady. You would attract a great deal of notice. You would have a husband with prospects in Parliament.\u201d Granted, they were prospects Toby had been purposely avoiding for the better part of a decade, but just for the sake of argument... He swept her through a turn. \u201cYou would not have married a lord at all, but you would be a lady of influence.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a cautious smile that set his world spinning. \u201cSurely you\u2019re not seriously suggesting I marry you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, forcing a self-deprecating laugh. \u201cI would never suggest such a thing.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t know how these blithe dismissals kept wounding him. She couldn\u2019t know that bruised male pride was a dangerous beast.</p><p>Toby lowered his voice to a seductive murmur. \u201cIf I paid court to you, Isabel, I would make more than suggestions. I would make promises. I would pledge to value your ideals, never stifle or belittle them. I would vow to display your talents to their best advantage, and to guard you from those who wish you ill.\u201d</p><p>The music stopped, and Toby whirled her to a halt.</p><p>\u201cIf I proposed marriage to you,\u201d he said, \u201cI would kneel at your feet. Pledge to you my undying devotion, a share in my worldly possessions, and the protection of my body. I would promise to cherish you all the days of your life, and make your happiness my own. Because that is what you deserve from a husband. No less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she sighed. Her lips fell slightly apart. Shallow breaths lifted her chest. At last. He had her well and truly enchanted now. Toby supposed he ought to release her. He\u2019d proven his point, hadn\u2019t he? He still knew how to dazzle a girl. But something compelled him to go on.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I did offer for you,\u201d he asked, \u201cwould it be so very horrible?\u201d</p><p>He hardly knew what murky pit of his soul that question had crawled out from, but he knew it wasn\u2019t aimed at this girl. It was meant for Sophia, and Lucy, and every other young lady who\u2019d grown out of loving him and married some other man.</p><p>But it was Isabel who must answer for them all. She was here, and she was breathless in his arms, and she had the power to crush or redeem him with a single syllable. Yes, he still knew how to dazzle a girl\u2014he\u2019d practically emerged from the womb with that gift. But deep down, at his core\u2014could he ever find what it took to secure a woman\u2019s love?</p><p>Give me a word. One word.</p><p>\u201cWould it be so unthinkable?\u201d he asked softly, earnestly.</p><p>Before she could speak, someone stepped between them and the nearby candelabra, throwing a shadow over them both.</p><p>\u201cExcuse the interruption.\u201d The voice was a smooth baritone. \u201cBut I\u2019d thank you to let the lady go.\u201d</p><p>Without releasing Isabel, Toby cast a glance toward the speaker. Of course, it was her brother. Sir Benedict Grayson, paragon of valor, miserable dancer, and great hulking brute with murder in his eyes. Worse, behind him stood Jeremy, Lucy, and the woman who\u2019d left him at the altar and fled halfway around the world\u2014Sophia.</p> <p>Now he needed to hear Isabel\u2019s answer more than ever.</p><p>Toby said, \u201cI beg your pardon. This is a private conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any longer, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Grayson folded massive arms over his chest. \u201cThe conversation is over.\u201d Lowering his voice, he growled, \u201cGet your hands off my sister.\u201d</p><p>The musicians struck up a new melody, but no one in the room was dancing. All eyes were on their little tableau.</p><p>\u201cIn a moment,\u201d Toby said smoothly, enjoying the upper hand. He refused to let Grayson cow him. The man might be a dockside laborer in gentleman\u2019s clothing, but Toby was taller. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting on a word from Miss Grayson. I\u2019ve asked her a question, and she hasn\u2019t yet answered.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to Isabel, tripping straight into her solemn, remarkable eyes. A strange sense of destiny overcame him. In his gut, Toby knew that the events of the next minute could very well mean the rearrangement of his life, his face, or both. He had a choice. He could release her, from his embrace and his question, surrender a second lady to this thieving bastard, and continue the miserable pastime of searching for his misplaced self-worth at the bottom of brandy decanters.</p><p>Or he could hold on to this beautiful, intelligent, passionate woman. Perhaps forever.</p><p>Grayson scowled. \u201cBel, what the devil is he talking about? You don\u2019t have to answer this man anything.\u201d He lowered his voice to a gruff whisper. \u201cDo you want me to hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she gasped, her gaze flitting around the assembled crowd. \u201cNo, nothing of the sort. Sir Toby just asked me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo marry him,\u201d Toby interrupted. Loudly and clearly, with a certainty that surprised even him. An excited murmur swept the crowd.</p><p>Leveling a cool gaze at Grayson, he continued, \u201cI\u2019ve asked your sister to marry me. And now I\u2019m waiting ...\u201d He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cIt would seem we\u2019re all waiting ... to hear her reply.\u201d</p><p>The excited murmur dissolved into silence. Grayson\u2019s face turned a satisfying shade of ash. And suddenly, Toby was having the time of his life. He\u2019d stolen Isabel straight from the scoundrel\u2019s arms, and he was not going to give her back. Not without a fight. He released Isabel\u2019s waist and took her soft, delicate hand in both of his. \u201cWas it public notice you wanted? All eyes are on you now, my dear,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cAnd I must confess, I\u2019ve always wanted to do this.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, mute with shock, as he sank to one knee.</p><p>\u201cMiss Isabel Grayson.\u201d His voice echoed off the marble tile. \u201cWould you do me the inestimable honor of becoming my wife?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m engaged.\u201d Bel joined her brother and sister-in-law at the breakfast table the next morning.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gray said tersely, his face hidden behind a newspaper. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>To be honest, neither could Bel. She\u2019d passed a fitful night, plucking at the lace-edged coverlet and reliving the evening\u2019s events again and again in her mind\u2014each time hoping for a different conclusion. By dawn, she\u2019d nearly convinced herself the entire episode was simply a strange, vivid dream. But judging by her brother\u2019s ill-humor this morning, it would seem to have been real.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m engaged,\u201d she said again. If she said it enough times, she might begin to believe it. Gray cleared his throat. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Bel, you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d He stopped himself and appeared to consider before beginning again, more softly this time. \u201cYour ... engagement\u201d \u2014he ground out the word\u2014\u201cis still a matter of discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat your brother means to say, is that it happened so quickly,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken us all by surprise.\u201d</p><p>It had taken no one by surprise more than Bel. She couldn\u2019t even recall her thoughts at the moment when her traitorous lips had formed the word \u201cyes.\u201d Obviously, there had been no thoughts in her head at all. Only the sight of Sir Toby\u2019s devilish grin, and the warmth of his hands grasping hers, and the sound of a hundred pairs of lungs seizing in anticipation of her very next word.</p><p>And\u2014God help her\u2014some emotion akin to enjoyment.</p><p>Madness, that\u2019s what her acceptance had been. A moment of sheer insanity. Not that she could let anyone suspect it now. No, the only thing worse than impetuously accepting a proposal at her first ball would be callously breaking it the next day. She would appear fickle, immature, prone to wild vacillations of emotion: everything a lady of influence was not. The decision had been made in a moment of madness, but as Sir Toby himself had pointed out, a marriage to him could still further her goals. So long as, from this point forward, she behaved with restraint and acted as though it were all part of her plan.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bel replied. \u201cIt did happen quickly, and I\u2019m glad of it.\u201d She nibbled at a point of toast.</p><p>\u201cBut why did we have to leave the ball so early? People wanted to congratulate us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to congratulate, not yet.\u201d Gray attacked a slab of ham with knife and fork. \u201cI haven\u2019t given my consent.\u201d</p><p>Bel stared at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to withhold it? You promised I might marry whomever I choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should know better than to make promises,\u201d her brother grumbled around a bite of ham.</p><p>\u201cPicked a devil of a year to start keeping them.\u201d</p><p>Sophia mediated with a soothing tone. \u201cGray wants to speak with Toby before he gives his formal consent. Joss will want to meet him, too. He may not be your guardian, but he is your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Joss this morning?\u201d Bel asked.</p><p>\u201cHe took a tray to the nursery. Little Jacob is cutting teeth and feeling out of sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name did that man say to you?\u201d Gray asked, snapping open a newspaper. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what dastardly lies he must have spun, to persuade you to accept him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he did not tell me any lies,\u201d Bel replied calmly. \u201cWe merely had the opportunity to converse, and arrived at the conclusion that we would be well-matched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell-matched,\u201d her brother echoed with disbelief. \u201cYou say he told you no lies? Well, then I suppose he told you about his history with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d Sophia whispered in a reproving tone. The two exchanged pointed glances over the paper before Gray folded it and laid it aside. What ever conflict had existed moments ago was evidently resolved now, as evidenced by the affectionate brush of Gray\u2019s fingers over his wife\u2019s wrist. Bel normally found it sweet, the way they conversed in looks and light touches in place of words.</p><p>It was less sweet when they were clearly discussing her.</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak privately,\u201d Sophia whispered to Bel, dismissing the servants with an elegant, self-assured flick of her wrist.</p><p>Bel sighed inwardly. She loved her new sister, but living with Sophia meant a daily struggle with envy. She was so beautiful, so graceful. And though Bel rejoiced to see her brother happily wed, in moments of weakness she\u2014just the tiniest bit\u2014resented sharing his attention. But she needn\u2019t share Sir Toby\u2019s attention with Sophia. He was her betrothed; he belonged to Bel alone. The thought sparked a little fire inside her.</p><p>Sophia inched her chair closer to Bel\u2019s. \u201cI wasn\u2019t certain how much to say last night, but after talking it over with Gray ...\u201d She cast Gray a cautious look, and he nodded in encouragement. Sophia turned back to Bel. \u201cThere is something I must tell you. Before I met your brother, I was betrothed to another man. Bel, I was engaged to Toby.\u201d</p><p>Bel choked on her toast. \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. We were to have been married last December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Sophia worried a crease in the tablecloth. \u201cI lied to him, and to all my friends and family, and then I ran away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat dreadful act could Sir Toby have committed, to make you flee your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cToby was a perfect gentleman. The dreadful acts were all mine, I\u2019m afraid. I can\u2019t regret making the choices that led me to Gray, but I\u2019m still ashamed of how I treated Toby.\u201d</p><p>Bel inhaled slowly, absorbing this new information. Sir Toby, once engaged to Sophia! So much for claiming the gentleman\u2019s undivided attention.</p><p>Gray swore under his breath. \u201cThe man\u2019s an oily bilge rat. He\u2019s angry with me for taking his bride, and now he\u2019s just trying to get back at me by\u2014\u201d He bit off the sentence when Sophia threw him a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cBy marrying me,\u201d Bel finished for him. \u201cI see. You assume the only reason Sir Toby would propose to me is to get back at you. He couldn\u2019t possibly be interested in me. Is that what you\u2019re implying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBel, no.\u201d Gray scrubbed his face with his hand. \u201cOf course, any man would be desperate to marry you. But considering past events, and the speed with which he pursued you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could he harbor any such scheme?\u201d Bel asked. \u201cSir Toby didn\u2019t even know my name.\u201d</p><p>They both stared at her.</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d Sophia asked. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bel insisted. \u201cWhen we ... left the ballroom together, he had no idea I was Gray\u2019s sister. When I told him my name, he was shocked indeed\u2014and even more surprised that I did not recognize his. He was sure you would have mentioned him to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I should have told you earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Gray told his wife. \u201cHow could you have predicted last evening\u2019s events?</p><p>Normally, there\u2019s time between introductions and betrothal to discuss such things.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>\u201cBel, you must admit, this \u2018proposal\u2019 happened with suspicious alacrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t entirely his fault, either. I\u2019m the one who broached the topic of marriage.\u201d Bel pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cI\u2019m not certain what came over me,\u201d she said, too stunned to censor her comments. \u201cOne moment, he was a handsome stranger, and the next I was conversing with him as though I\u2019d known him for years. He ... he put me so at ease. He made me smile.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d kissed her. It wasn\u2019t as though she could neglect that bit. She\u2019d lain awake all night, trying to erase the sensation of his lips against hers. Trying to forget the taste of him, so forbidden and sweet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Gray said. \u201cWhen the rat comes calling today, I\u2019ll send him scurrying. You\u2019re not going to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I must,\u201d Bel protested. \u201cOr what will people say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll say you\u2019ve come to your senses, recovered your wits.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019ll know I lost them. They\u2019ll see me as another flighty, impressionable girl. Bel said, \u201cI\u2019m going marry Sir Toby.\u201d She turned to Sophia. \u201cWhat\u2019s past is past. I don\u2019t see why your prior engagement should affect mine. Say what you will, I cannot suspect him of any malicious intent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be truthful, neither can I,\u201d Sophia said.</p><p>While Gray harrumphed and made a show of busying himself with his food, Sophia pushed aside her plate to make room for a stack of newspapers tied with twine.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to see these,\u201d she told Bel. \u201cI know you do not read The Prattler. I\u2019m not so fond of the scandal sheets as I once was, but Lady Kendall saved these and passed them along to me.\u201d She picked open the knot and opened the top paper to the third page. \u201cThere,\u201d she said, pointing out an illustration with her fingertip. \u201cThis appeared in February, a full month before we arrived in London and my marriage to Gray was announced.\u201d</p><p>Bel took the paper from her sister\u2019s hand to examine it more closely. The image was most definitely a likeness of Sir Toby, though his harmonious features were thrown out of balance by the caricaturist\u2019s pen. His forehead was too wide; his jaw, unnaturally square. Regardless, he remained breathtakingly handsome, even rendered in unkind strokes. Bel read the caption aloud. \u201cThe Rake Reborn.\u201d Then beneath it, a line in smaller print:</p><p>\u201cLondon\u2019s famed Lothario survives to carouse another day.\u201d In the background of the illustration, a group of ladies struck desperate postures, hands to their foreheads and shoulders limp. Ribbons of speech flowed from the ladies\u2019 mouths. \u201cIt\u2019s his golden-haired beauty,\u201d one sighed. \u201cNo, his silver tongue!\u201d argued another. The third fanned herself and declaimed, \u201cHow he gives me the vapors! We must recover by the sea.\u201d At the bottom, the caricature was signed, H. M. Hollyhurst.</p><p>Bel looked up, puzzled. \u201cRecover by the sea? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I disappeared, my parents spread the word that I\u2019d taken ill and been sent to the seaside to convalesce. Instead of focusing on the scandal of my disappearance, the gossipmongers\u2014</p><p>and this Mr. Hollyhurst\u2014took a keen interest in Toby. They labeled him the \u2018Rake Reborn,\u2019</p><p>insinuated that he rejoiced in my illness and used it as an opportunity to prolong his debauched bachelor life.\u201d</p><p>Bel looked at the illustration again, cringing. She\u2019d suspected him to be a rake, but seeing the evidence in print... Sir Toby surrounded by fair-haired, slender, classical beauties adorned with plumes and jewels. A dozen Sophias.</p><p>She laid aside her toast. \u201cI understand why Sir Toby said he\u2019s weary of gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be,\u201d Sophia said, riffling the papers, \u201cfor he\u2019s been in The Prattler every day for months. If it\u2019s not one of Mr. Hollyhurst\u2019s caricatures, it\u2019s a notice in the society column. They\u2019ve cataloged his attendance at every ball, boxing match, opera house, and gaming club. The paper has even gone so far as to tally the number of his paramours, since his near escape.\u201d</p><p>The number of his paramours? Bel almost asked Sophia to relate the estimate, then stopped herself. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t credit any of it? Sir Toby told me himself, one shouldn\u2019t believe everything in the newspapers. Do you believe such behavior of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cAt least, not to this degree. But I am amazed that he has tolerated such treatment.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cDo you realize, he could have made an immense scandal when I eloped, or even sued my father for breach of our marriage contract? Yet he said nothing, at least not publicly. He allowed the illusion of my illness to stand and took a drubbing in the papers all the while.\u201d</p><p>An unhappy realization settled on Bel. \u201cHe must have been very much in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Gray coughed violently.</p><p>Sophia pursed her lips. \u201cNo, actually. I don\u2019t believe he was. But his pride must have incurred deep wounds, even if his heart remained intact. It must have been difficult for him to endure all this\u201d\u2014she indicated the newspapers\u2014\u201cso quietly. I don\u2019t know why he did, after the way I used him so ill. But he has borne the brunt of public speculation regarding our broken engagement, and if he had not, I would have been ruined. We should not have been welcome in Society. Your own prospects for marriage would have been destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe owe him much, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do.\u201d Sophia gave her a meaningful look. \u201cWe owe him the chance to find happiness. I did not love him as a wife should, but I cared for him\u2014I care for him too much to see him trapped in a polite society marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrapped?\u201d Bel\u2019s teacup met its saucer with a loud crack. \u201cAre you saying Sir Toby shouldn\u2019t marry me? Am I not good enough for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it at all,\u201d Sophia replied.</p><p>\u201cBel, he\u2019s not good enough for you,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to say that, either.\u201d Sophia took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cBel, Toby will make some lady a fine husband. And you are everything he could dream of in a wife. Together, I daresay you could be very happy indeed\u2014if you loved one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in love with the man.\u201d Gray\u2019s knife clattered to his plate. \u201cShe only met him last night.\u201d He muttered an oath.</p><p>Bel cringed. Love. It seemed there was no escaping that word lately. Her brothers, Sophia ...</p><p>they all exhorted that she must marry for love. As if by saying this, they granted her some grand indulgence, a gift any young lady would be delighted to receive. But to Bel, this insistence on a love match presented an unwelcome obstacle. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to marry for love. Not romantic love, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhyever not?\u201d Sophia asked.</p><p>She hedged. It seemed impolite, and most likely in effective, to decry romantic love to two people so thoroughly steeped in it. Her parents had married for love, as had both of her brothers. Of the three matches, two had ended in desolation and the third\u2014successful as it appeared thus far\u2014was just a few months old. She avoided love for the same reason she eschewed spirits: she\u2019d witnessed, firsthand, the ravages of both.</p><p>\u201cI have so many plans, so much work to do,\u201d she said. Striving for a diplomatic tone, she added, \u201cAnd I\u2019ve noticed love has a way of altering a person\u2019s priorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well it should, if the thing\u2019s done right,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Sophia touched her wrist. \u201cOf course you could not be in love with Toby so soon. But deep in your heart, if you search, do you detect some inclination to affection? Could you grow to love him, with time?\u201d</p><p>I hope not. Bel pushed back from the table and stood. \u201cSophia, please understand. I am delighted that you and my brother have found one another. I know you mean to be kind. But I do not wish to marry for love; and I would ask you to consider that perhaps Sir Toby feels the same. Otherwise, why did he propose to you?\u201d</p><p>Sophia made a subtle wince. Bel\u2019s was overt. Those were the most uncharitable words she\u2019d ever spoken to her sister. Perhaps the most uncharitable words she\u2019d spoken to anyone. But here she\u2019d resolved to embrace this engagement with optimism, and Sophia seemed determined to ruin it all\u2014first with her revelations, then her stack of scandal sheets, and now this questioning.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Bel said, sinking back into her chair, \u201cI know you mean well, but Dolly ...\u201d She turned to her brother, knowing he was powerless to deny her anything when she employed a soft tone and his pet name from their youth. \u201cDolly, you promised I might marry whom I choose. I choose to marry Sir Toby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor ... several reasons.\u201d</p><p>Not because she desired him, or because she\u2019d allowed him to kiss her on the terrace. Truly, that wasn\u2019t it at all. It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI want a marriage that will place me in the public notice and make me a lady of influence.\u201d She gestured toward the stacked copies of The Prattler. \u201cSir Toby is perfect. All London takes an interest his exploits, he will soon serve in the House of Commons, and by Sophia\u2019s own account he is a fine man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby told you he would be serving in Parliament?\u201d Sophia asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Did he never mention it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked stunned.</p><p>Gray studied Bel for a moment, then put a hand to his temple. \u201cBel, it\u2019s not that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of the doorbell interrupted them.</p><p>\u201cThat must be him.\u201d Bel stood up again. Blood rushed to her head. Goodness, she\u2019d been up and down so many times, she might as well have been in church. \u201cDo I look well enough?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smoothed her hands over the skirt of her best day dress, a pale blue muslin frock trimmed with ivory lace.</p><p>\u201cBel, you are stunning, as always. You\u2019ll take his breath away.\u201d Ignoring Gray\u2019s harrumph, Sophia took one bite of her toast and then set it aside. \u201cShall I come with you to greet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gray said in a tone of finality. \u201cBel, kindly go up to the nursery and ask Joss to meet me in my study. If Sir Toby Aldridge wants a glimpse of either of the breathtaking beauties in this house, he\u2019ll have to get through me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir Benedict.\u201d Upon entering Grayson\u2019s study, Toby made a courteous bow. His gesture was not reciprocated. The brute narrowed his eyes at him. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste time pretending to like one another.\u201d</p><p>Toby straightened and set his jaw. \u201cFine with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd call me Gray.\u201d Gray indicated a chair as he rounded the desk to settle in his own.</p><p>\u201cEveryone does, even my enemies.\u201d</p><p>Toby smiled as he smoothed his trousers and took his seat. \u201cIsabel doesn\u2019t. She calls you Dolly.\u201d</p> <p>Instantly, the tension in the room leapt to a new plateau. Gray\u2019s narrowed eyes became slits. Then he leaned back in his chair and gave Toby a cold smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been curious to meet you, Sir Toby Aldridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I, you. Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting position I\u2019m in.\u201d Gray ran a fingertip along the edge of his blotter. \u201cI wonder if you can appreciate it. Here before me sits the man who let a remarkable, beautiful woman slip through his fingers last December. I revile you for that idiocy; yet I must also thank you for it. Your mistake was my good fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy discretion is your good fortune.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes locked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gray finally said, \u201cI\u2019m aware of that. But just when I am determined that I must push aside my extreme loathing for an otherwise contemptible ass and express some gratitude\u201d\u2014he suddenly shot to his feet and strode to the window\u2014\u201cthe contemptible ass manages to seduce my baby sister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow see here,\u201d Toby said coolly. \u201cYou may have all the contempt for me you wish, but there is only one seducer in this room. You\u2019re the blackguard who absconded with my intended bride. At least I\u2019m here offering for Isabel properly. Honorably. Do you seriously expect me to grovel and plead for the dubious pleasure of becoming your brother?\u201d</p><p>Gray turned from the window. \u201cI already have a brother. I don\u2019t need another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then one wonders why you are bringing your sister out. It would prove difficult to marry Isabel off without acquiring one.\u201d Toby ran a hand through his hair. \u201cCan a man get a drink in this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drink? Before noon?\u201d Gray crossed to the bar and uncorked a bottle. \u201cWell, there\u2019s one point in your favor.\u201d He handed Toby a snifter of brandy and started pouring another for himself. \u201cThe papers have a lot to say about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have a lot to say about you, too,\u201d Toby said, thinking of the exalted praise England\u2019s newest knight had enjoyed over past weeks. \u201cI know better than to believe them. You\u2019re quite the hero, Gray. Tell me, while you were braving fire, storm, sharks, and smugglers to rescue that boatload of helpless kittens and schoolgirls ... was it a two-headed sea serpent you wrestled into submission? Or did it have three heads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour,\u201d Gray said coolly. \u201cWell then, let\u2019s get to the heart of the matter, shall we? May I assume you know how I rebuilt my family\u2019s fortune and amassed the generous dowry you would waltz away with in the course of an evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivateering, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, privateering. Sanctioned piracy. I\u2019m a respectable shipping merchant now, but I\u2019ve years of cheating, stealing, and bloodshed in my past. I don\u2019t like violence, but I\u2019m not above it. I sank ships and spilled men\u2019s blood, all so my brother might have a profession and Bel could marry well. We may be of different mothers, but we are all Graysons, all family.\u201d Gray drained his brandy and sent the glass clattering to his desk. Then he crossed his arms over his chest and fixed Toby with an intense glare. \u201cFamily is everything to me. If you hurt my sister, I will gleefully kill you.\u201d</p> <p>Toby paused. He had no doubt in his mind that Gray meant that threat. Not only meant it, but would make good on it, even if doing so sent him to the gallows and they ended up sharing a hackney to hell. \u201cFortunately for my neck and yours, I\u2019ve no intention of hurting Isabel,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cI\u2019m going to marry her.\u201d</p><p>Gray shook his head. \u201cAt most, you\u2019re engaged to her. Engagements can be broken.\u201d</p><p>Oh no, he didn\u2019t. Not again. Toby would be damned if he\u2019d let this man break up his second betrothal. \u201cListen, what\u2019s done is done. You wanted to make a public scene at Kendall House last night, and you got your wish. Now your sister and I are quite publicly engaged. There\u2019s no way to undo it without tarnishing her reputation. Not to mention, disappointing her hopes.\u201d</p><p>Gray regarded him closely. \u201cAre you certain? You seem rather invested in bachelorhood, by all accounts. You wouldn\u2019t be interested in a nice, long holiday on the Continent instead? A thousand pounds can buy a fellow rather warm hospitality.\u201d</p><p>Toby stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re attempting to bribe me. With a bit of gold and a few Parisian gelettes as inducement. For God\u2019s sake, man, I\u2019ve a vast estate in Surrey and an income of six thousand a year. Your \u2018offer\u2019 insults us both. Does your sister know what a cheap price you place on her happiness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no price I would not pay for Bel\u2019s happiness. I\u2019ve made achieving her happiness my life\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now I\u2019ll be taking over that job.\u201d Toby smiled and relaxed in his chair. He was enjoying watching Gray sweat. He\u2019d been just a youth when his own sisters married, but he\u2019d already been the man of the family\u2014and he remembered well the helpless ire that accompanied surrendering one\u2019s sister to a stranger. Gray had his empathy, but not his mercy. \u201cYou\u2019re clearly not up to the task. If your sister were happy in her current situation, why would she jump to marry the first gentleman to pay her a bit of attention? She was miserable at that ball last night, until I put a smile on her face. I know how to keep a lady happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Gray smirked. \u201cI don\u2019t think my wife would agree.\u201d</p><p>Oh, now that was a low blow. And a damaging one. Toby\u2019s arrogance took a sizeable dent. It still plagued him late at night, the ceaseless speculation. He\u2019d treated Sophia with solicitude, patience, and, of course, copious charm. What could he have done to push her away, and into the arms of this rogue? She had not even received him today, in her own home. Gray continued, \u201cBel is not like other young ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well. I had noticed that.\u201d All thoughts of Sophia were instantly banished. He thought instead of Isabel\u2019s exotic beauty and her melodic accent, and the bold innocence of her kiss. The kiss that hummed in his blood, even now ...</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d Gray skewered him with a look, as though he read Toby\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cBel\u2019s grown up sheltered from society, but she\u2019s been a witness to misery no lady should ever see. Our father succumbed to drink and her mother to madness, while\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait just a minute. Her mother went mad?\u201d If he did want an excuse to back out of this, Toby had just been handed one. Few gentlemen sought a bride with a family history of insanity.</p><p>\u201cNot how you\u2019re thinking. When Bel was a girl, her mother was stricken with a tropical fever. She survived\u2014barely\u2014but her mind was never the same. Bel grew up essentially alone, once my brother and I were out on the sea. Her faith sustained her. She\u2019s strong in spirit, but filled with na\u00efve, fragile hopes ... and very high expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I can meet them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I don\u2019t.\u201d Gray resumed his seat. \u201cHowever, for the sake of humoring my sister and preserving her reputation, I\u2019ve decided to let you try. But I warn you\u2014if at any point during the engagement, Bel seems anything less than enraptured with the prospect of marrying you, I\u2019ll call the wedding off immediately.\u201d</p><p>His words gave Toby pause, as he recalled the lengths he\u2019d gone to just to elicit those few smiles. Now he would have an \u201cenraptured\u201d bride, or no bride at all? He wasn\u2019t sure he liked those odds. Isabel Grayson did not seem a lady inclined to romantic raptures\u2014she\u2019d only agreed to marry him for his influence. \u201cIf you\u2019ve such a low opinion of me, why are granting your consent at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake no mistake, I think you\u2019re an ass, and it eats away at my gut, just to imagine calling you brother. But I\u2019d take no pleasure in seeing you fail at betrothal again.\u201d Gray scowled. It was the expression of a man wrestling his own humility. \u201cBel\u2019s been disappointed with London, despite all our efforts to keep her entertained. Nothing amuses her. She\u2019s so damned quiet, so serious. I\u2019ve watched her frowning in silence through a dozen dinner parties and musicales. But when she danced with you\u2014and God, it kills me to say it\u2014she looked happy. And then this morning, she spoke angry words to Sophia in your defense.\u201d Gray shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard her speak angry words to anyone. Reproachful words, yes. Disappointed words, more often than I care to remember. But never angry ones.\u201d</p><p>Toby couldn\u2019t quite follow the gist of this argument. She was happy last night, angry this morning ... \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, I think my sister\u2019s built quite a fortress around her emotions. She\u2019d call it morality; I\u2019m inclined to call it fear. But what ever those walls are made of, for some unfathomable reason, you seem able to breach them. I\u2019m saying, you managed to put a smile on her face last night.\u201d He pinned Toby with a threatening look. \u201cKeep it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Toby answered, resolute. Indeed, never in his life had he been so determined to succeed at any venture. It was what he did best, keeping ladies smiling. He would find a way to keep Isabel happy, too. There was nothing in the world that could have convinced him to back down from the challenge in Sir Benedict Grayson\u2019s eyes. Nothing.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Gray called, rising to his feet. \u201cThat\u2019ll be my brother, Joss.\u201d</p><p>Toby stood, refreshing his grin and readying a bow. Perhaps the younger Grayson brother would be more congenial. Second sons typically had very different personalities.</p><p>\u201cSir Toby Aldridge,\u201d Gray said, \u201callow me to introduce my brother and partner in Grayson Brothers Shipping, Captain Josiah Grayson.\u201d</p><p>Well, Toby thought, he\u2019d been right. The brothers were certainly different. Gray had told him the Grayson siblings were born of different mothers, but Toby had been expecting a brother who was half-Spanish, like Isabel. Not one who was half-African, like ... like scarcely anyone he knew, save servants. Certainly like no one to whom he\u2019d ever bowed. Toby felt himself the object of keen scrutiny as he stared into Joss\u2019s face\u2014a darker copy of his brother\u2019s. Begrudgingly, he conceded a silent point to Gray. The bastard had certainly played this card well. Or, rather, he\u2019d played the bastard card well. There was no way Toby could register surprise now. Not when he\u2019d just wagered his pride and self-respect against Isabel Grayson\u2019s happiness.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Grayson. A pleasure.\u201d Smile frozen in place, Toby made a smooth bow. There, that hadn\u2019t been so difficult.</p><p>\u201cSir Toby.\u201d Joss returned the bow. \u201cI\u2019d say the pleasure is mine, but I have an unfortunate habit of honesty, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unfortunate indeed. This Grayson brother was not more congenial than the first. He was less. It was plain to see there was a plank-sized chip on Joss\u2019s shoulder, balanced by the weight of general ill humor on the other. A right surly fellow, if ever Toby had met one. Just bloody perfect.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to allow this?\u201d Joss spoke to Gray, making a dismissive gesture in Toby\u2019s direction. \u201cAfter one evening, you\u2019re going to let Bel marry this ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to let her remain engaged to this ass,\u201d Gray corrected. \u201cFor now. We\u2019ll see if she still feels the same, come September.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeptember?\u201d Toby echoed. \u201cIt\u2019s barely April. Six weeks is ample time for an engagement. We\u2019ll be married in May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuly, or not at all,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThat\u2019s my final concession.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ll see about that.</p> <p>Catching Toby\u2019s frown, Joss raised an eyebrow. \u201cBy all means, press your case further. \u2018Not at all\u2019 is my preference.\u201d</p><p>Toby kept his indignant retort to himself. What a family. A dandified footpad playing patriarch, seconded by his disagreeable bastard brother. But no matter. Their mutual loathing would only sweeten Toby\u2019s triumph. To win Isabel, he could stomach far worse.</p><p>And of course, just as he\u2019d formed the thought, along came worse.</p><p>\u201cPapa, Papa!\u201d</p><p>A tawny-skinned urchin with close-cropped hair barreled into the room, heading straight for the brothers but colliding instead with Toby\u2019s leg. The child went sprawling to the carpet, first scuffing the shine on Toby\u2019s boot, then attacking the offending boot in retaliation, to the point of sinking his teeth into the fine-grained leather.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Toby struggled for balance, attempting to shake the little demon off his leg. His efforts only resulted in encouraging the boy to cling more tightly, lashing his arms and legs around Toby\u2019s ankle until he seemed a more permanent part of the boot than the tassel. The imp even had the nerve to laugh.</p> <p>God only knew which brother\u2019s indiscretion this boy represented. Neither man rushed to claim him, presumably too amused by Toby\u2019s predicament to help.</p><p>\u201cJacob, no!\u201d Isabel flew into the room, coming to land at Toby\u2019s feet in a flutter of pale-blue muslin and lace. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said, attempting to disentangle the child from Toby\u2019s leg. \u201cI told the nursemaid I\u2019d take him down to the garden, but then he dashed away from me, and I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Toby said, placing a light touch on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve ten young nieces and nephews. Really, it\u2019s all right.\u201d She ceased struggling with the boy and looked up at him. And the grasping child, the insolent brothers, the world around them\u2014simply ceased to exist. Moonlight did not begin to do her beauty justice, Toby realized. Isabel Grayson was made for the morning sun. Gentle, warm light that was in no rush, that had the entire day ahead of itself, that labored patiently to illuminate each glossy strand of her hair, each golden contour of her features, the petal-soft texture of her lips. And when coupled with the radiance that emanated from within\u2014there was no other word for it.</p><p>She glowed.</p><p>\u201cSir Toby,\u201d she said, her expression aggrieved. \u201cMy nephew ... I beg your pardon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t distress yourself.\u201d He hooked a hand under her elbow to help her to her feet. She really needed to stand. Once he\u2019d finished his appraisal of her beauty above the neck, it was all too easy to let his gaze descend to where her lace-trimmed neckline gaped, offering a view of lush, full breasts and the dark, enticing valley between them. Toby ceased seeing features and began seeing ... possibilities.</p><p>Yes, she truly needed to stand.</p><p>\u201cJacob.\u201d The deep command from Joss had the instantaneous effect of loosening the child\u2019s grip. A moment later, circulation resumed in Toby\u2019s toes.</p> <p>\u201cYour son?\u201d Toby asked Joss.</p><p>Joss nodded in confirmation.</p><p>\u201cDelightful child. And did his mother travel with you to London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my wife remained on Tortola,\u201d Joss said. \u201cIn the churchyard.\u201d</p><p>Right. A surly, illegitimate widower. The man\u2019s ill humor began to make sense.</p><p>\u201cCome to Auntie Bel, darling.\u201d Rescuing them all from the awkwardness of the moment, Isabel scooped the child into her arms, jutting out one hip to make a seat for him, all the while tickling the squirming bundle of mischief. She had the look of an early Renaissance Madonna: dark, radiant, rounded and soft, serene in the face of squalling infants, and beautiful to an unearthly degree.</p><p>A strange compulsion gripped Toby. Sank teeth into him. Before him stood this living portrait of divine domesticity, and in some deep corner of his being, he longed to be a part of it. He\u2019d never experienced a need so sudden, so visceral, so strong. He couldn\u2019t even put a name to the sensation. It wasn\u2019t desire, lust, infatuation, attraction ... it most certainly wasn\u2019t love. But it still distilled to those three simple words:</p><p>I want that.</p><p>A wife. A child. All the pleasant activities a man enjoyed with his wife in the getting of a child. Months of anticipating the arrival of said child\u2014wondering if the shade of his hair would be black like his mother\u2019s or light brown like Toby\u2019s or some shade in the spectrum between. New boots fashioned in cured leather, resistant to the impressions of milk teeth. Marriage. Family. A smiling Isabel.</p><p>I want that.</p><p>And I\u2019m going to have it.</p><p>Isabel blushed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the intrusion. We\u2019ll leave you to your conversation,\u201d she said, dipping in a little curtsy.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toby blurted out, snapping himself from his reverie. \u201cThat is, don\u2019t go. After all, it\u2019s you I\u2019ve come to see. I thought perhaps you\u2019d like to go driving.\u201d When she looked nonplussed, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s something betrothed couples do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She gave him a shy smile. \u201cThen I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Toby looked to Gray and Joss. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve finished our business here, gentlemen?\u201d They</p><p>offered begrudging nods. \u201cOh,\u201d Toby continued, speaking to Isabel, \u201cthere was one thing. We were discussing the wedding date. I suggest July. Never mind the unbearable heat in July. The only reason to be married in June is to make a public splash, to have all of Society watching. In July, many of the good families will already be leaving for the countryside, and the guest list will be smaller. Your brother need not incur so much expense. This is my reasoning ... but naturally, Isabel, your own preference is paramount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, if the decision is mine, I think I should prefer to be married in June.\u201d Allowing young Jacob to slide to the floor, she turned to her brother. \u201cI\u2019m certain Dolly is not concerned with the expense.\u201d</p><p>Toby shot Gray a cold smile. \u201cWell, Dolly, are you concerned for the expense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>Toby captured Isabel\u2019s hand and tucked it into his arm. \u201cThen I gladly make the concession. June it is.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>An hour later, Bel feared she would not live out the day, much less survive to see June.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Sir Toby nestled closer on the phaeton seat. \u201cThis is a lovely morning.\u201d</p><p>Bel managed a slight nod in agreement. It was all the motion she dared venture. With one hand latched to the seat iron, the other gripping her bonnet, and both feet braced against the footboard, she had no free appendage with which to gesture. And as for speaking ... speaking was out of the question. She kept her jaw clenched, lest her teeth rattle loose from her skull as Sir Toby urged the horses faster over the cobblestones. When they rounded the bend at a perilous tilt, she did manage a little sound. Unfortunately, it was less of a word and more of a scream.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Turning to face her, he took the reins in one hand and stretched the other arm along the seat behind her. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>The phaeton bounced over a small rut, tossing Bel off-balance. Before she could catch herself, she had fallen against his side. His arm enfolded her shoulders, drawing her tight against his chest.</p><p>Whistling through his teeth, he slowed the horses and pulled the carriage to the side of the street. \u201cIsabel, darling, are you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no ...\u201d Bel fought to recover her breath. The carriage had come to a halt, but her world remained in motion. She was dizzy\u2014not only from that terrifying drive, but now from the sensation of his strong body wrapped so protectively around hers. \u201cI\u2019m not ill, it\u2019s only ... I\u2019m unaccustomed to driving like this, that\u2019s all. We don\u2019t have such fast carriages and fine teams on Tortola. It\u2019s a small island.\u201d She sat up a bit, placing her hand between them on the seat as a buffer.</p><p>\u201cWhat a dolt I am. I should have realized. And look, you\u2019ve gone all pale.\u201d He removed his hat and began fanning her with it. \u201cShall I take you back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, please don\u2019t. Truly, I am perfectly well now.\u201d Bel readjusted her bonnet.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m very certain.\u201d The concern in Toby\u2019s amber-flecked eyes pleased her. Sophia had been right. He would make a kind, solicitous husband. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to complain. It\u2019s a lovely phaeton.\u201d She ran a hand over the tufted, butter-soft leather.</p><p>At his soft command, the horses resumed a sedate walk. \u201cWe needn\u2019t continue driving at all,\u201d</p><p>he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we leave the phaeton with a groom and have a stroll about the shops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shops? I suppose we could, but I don\u2019t have need of anything. Do you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWhy, that\u2019s the very time to visit the shops\u2014when you don\u2019t need anything. To be truthful, however, I have been thinking of buying a new walking stick. I\u2019ve had my eye on a fine ivory-topped one at Brauchts\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA walking stick? Do you have some injury, then?\u201d Bel surreptitiously eyed his legs. They looked fit enough to her, his well-formed thighs and calves sheathed in tailored wool. She flushed and quickly averted her eyes. Yes, his legs looked well indeed. \u201cOr perhaps you suffer from the gout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gout?\u201d He laughed again, louder this time. \u201cNo, I have not lived such an immoderate life as to develop the gout at the age of nine-and-twenty. Nor have I suffered any injury, save that small one to my pride just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Then why do you need a walking stick, if you are not infirm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, no particular reason. They come in handy from time to time\u2014for gesturing toward sights of interest, rapping on doors, signaling the coachman ...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnd they look fine. It\u2019s the fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cSo this is the way you wish to spend our morning? Shopping for this ... this embellished stick, which a perfectly healthy gentleman carries around, for no real purpose other than to indicate his wealth?\u201d</p><p>His expression sobered. \u201cWell, that and gesturing,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t forget gesturing. And rapping on doors. There\u2019s that, too.\u201d</p><p>Bel had no response. Actually, she would have liked to respond that arms and hands generally worked well for her in those regards, but she had no wish to upset him further.</p><p>\u201cRight, well.\u201d He gave her a tight smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the shops another day, then. Are you fond of art? Shall I take you to an exhibition?\u201d</p><p>Bel perked up. Her appreciation for art had increased under Sophia\u2019s influence, as her sister-inlaw was an accomplished painter. \u201cThank you, I would like that very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He leaned closer and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll arrange a real treat for you. I\u2019ve a friend who can get us a private showing of the Parthenon marbles.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe sculptures Lord Elgin brought back from Greece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the very ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones Parliament just purchased on behalf of the English government?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy ... yes.\u201d He looked askance at her, obviously confused by the brittle tone of her remark. But Bel could not help herself. Useless walking sticks were one thing, but there was no holding her tongue on this matter. \u201cSir Toby, do you not realize Lord Elgin stole those statues from their rightful owners, the Greeks? And now Parliament has squandered millions of pounds to purchase them, while hardworking English farmers have not the corn to seed their fields, and orphaned children starve in the streets? It is a travesty!\u201d</p><p>He pulled the team to a halt. \u201cSo ...\u201d His lips pursed around the drawn out syllable. \u201cYou don\u2019t wish to see them?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe he would even ask! \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>An awkward minute passed. Embarrassed by her outburst but unable to apologize for it, Bel faced forward and made a show of straightening her gloves. She could feel Toby\u2019s eyes on her all the while. Eventually, the phaeton lurched into motion again.</p><p>Oh, he must think her inexcusably rude. Here he had suggested two different amusements, and she had refused them both. And with intemperate scoldings, no less. Bel made up her mind then and there to greet his next suggestion with polite enthusiasm, what ever it might be.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s Berkeley Square just up ahead. Can I offer you some refreshment?\u201d</p><p>Bel clapped her hands together and forced a bright tone. \u201cYes, thank you. That would be delightful.\u201d Her breakfast had been cut short, after all. A spot of tea would be most welcome. He maneuvered the carriage into the green in the center of the square, drawing the team to a halt beneath the shade of a large tree. Alighting from the phaeton, he tossed the reins and a coin to an eager boy, then beckoned a waiter from the establishment across the street. The two men conferred briefly, and then the waiter returned to the tea shop.</p><p>Wearing a renewed smile, Toby strolled around to Bel\u2019s side of the carriage. \u201cThere we are. Give it a moment, he\u2019ll have a lovely treat out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we go inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d He tossed his hat on the phaeton seat. \u201cIt\u2019s not the done thing. The ladies all take their refreshment out here, in the square, where they can see and be seen.\u201d</p><p>Bel folded her hands. She knew it would be impossible to become a lady of influence without attracting public notice; and one did not attract public notice without a certain amount of spectacle\u2014whether that spectacle involved sipping tea in a flashy carriage or selecting an infamous rake for a husband. So long as she reminded herself it was all for a purpose, she could justify the indulgence.</p> <p>Or so she thought.</p><p>The waiter appeared, bearing a tray with a glass dish. In the dish sat something that looked like a child\u2019s ball\u2014perfectly round, pale yellow in color, and sparkling in the morning sun.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely,\u201d she said, accepting the proffered dish and a small silver spoon. She looked to Toby. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, it\u2019s an ice, of course. Gunter\u2019s is famous for them. That\u2019s a sample of their newest flavor: lemon and lavender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn ice,\u201d she said wonderingly. The chill of the glass dish nipped at her gloved fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve never had one. Nothing freezes in the West Indies, you know. Until we arrived in London, I\u2019d never seen ice of any sort, much less one flavored with lemon and lavender.\u201d She prodded the treat with her spoon, breaking through a thin, granular crust to discover a softer, creamy texture beneath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best eat it quickly. Or it won\u2019t be an ice much longer, but only a syrup.\u201d</p><p>Bel looked up. \u201cIs that how it\u2019s sweetened, then? With sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes. It\u2019s sweet and cold, and ...\u201d He gave her a teasing grin. \u201cAnd you could discover that for yourself, if you\u2019d only have a taste.\u201d</p> <p>Her spoon hovered over the pale yellow ball. Beads of dew formed on the ice\u2019s surface and rolled down to pool in the shallow glass bowl. Bel\u2019s mouth watered, but she pushed the dish back at him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, feeling indescribably ill-mannered for refusing yet another of his gestures. But of all the things for him to suggest, why did he have to suggest this?</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He looked her up and down. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re concerned for your figure.\u201d</p><p>Her face burned, and she dropped her eyes. To be sure, he would have noticed her ample figure. She\u2019d learned some years ago that her body drew men\u2019s notice, whether she wished it or not. And she did not. Bel was extremely self-conscious about the voluptuous curves she\u2019d inherited from her mother\u2014over-large breasts, wide hips.</p><p>Though she had no wish to see those curves increase, they weren\u2019t the reason she declined the ice. \u201cI don\u2019t eat sugar,\u201d she explained. \u201cNot unless it is imported by my brothers\u2019 company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the sugar my brothers import is grown and harvested by free men.\u201d She cast a pointed look at the ice. \u201cThat is likely the product of slave labor.\u201d</p><p>Toby studied the growing puddle of lemon. \u201cDarling, that Quaker sugar boycott\u2014it went out with my grandmother\u2019s generation. The slave trade was abolished more than a decade ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe slave trade was abolished, yes. But slavery itself remains legal and is still the practice in nearly all sugar-producing countries.\u201d Bel clutched the seat iron with one hand, trying to keep a grip on her emotions. \u201cYou would offer this to me as refreshment? Tell me, what is refreshing about human bondage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I suppose ... That is to say ...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s only an ice.\u201d</p><p>They stared at one another then, in exquisitely painful silence. Bel started to wonder if she\u2019d made a very grave mistake. Of course, the entire engagement had been a mistake, but she\u2019d hoped it not an irredeemable one. Toby\u2019s infamous reputation would be of benefit in her quest to raise public consciousness, she\u2019d reasoned. But rakishness was one thing, and oppression was another. It\u2019s only an ice.</p><p>Of course, she reminded herself\u2014to him, it was only an ice. He didn\u2019t look at it and see the misery of a thousand souls served up in a chilled glass dish, as she did. He didn\u2019t know any of those thousand souls by name, as she did.</p><p>Toby lifted an eyebrow. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to melt, if you don\u2019t eat it. It will go to waste.\u201d</p><p>Bel sighed. He was right, there was no way to undo the injustice committed in the ice\u2019s creation. Still, she shook her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you shan\u2019t.\u201d Toby handed the dish to the young boy tending the horses. \u201cHere, lad. Have at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly, sir? You mean for me to eat it?\u201d A dirt-smeared hand closed around the dish.</p><p>\u201cYes, cert\u2014\u201d Before Toby could even make his assurances, the boy had devoured half the dish\u2019s contents. Wielding the spoon like a garden trowel, he ate greedily, as if the treat might disappear on its own, if he didn\u2019t work fast. The boy\u2019s enthusiasm was infectious, and Bel could not suppress a small laugh.</p><p>She suddenly realized Toby was watching her closely.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re smiling. Thank God. I was becoming a bit desperate there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I know you meant to be kind, but truly\u2014I could not have enjoyed the ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you can enjoy the boy\u2019s enjoyment of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly, though she didn\u2019t know how to explain. Growing up as she had, she\u2019d been acutely aware that every pleasure or convenience she enjoyed\u2014a clean shift, a warm bath, a cool drink\u2014came at the expense of another person\u2019s dignity. But viewing someone else\u2019s pleasure felt different. Safer. Last night, she\u2019d liked watching the dancers far more than she\u2019d liked dancing. Today, she could not enjoy eating the ice, but she could enjoy the boy\u2019s expression of innocent delight.</p><p>Bel tried to make sense of it, but the logic knotted in her mind. Biting her lip, she asked, \u201cDoes that make me a terrible hypocrite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Gently, he unfolded her fingers from the seat iron. She hadn\u2019t even realized she was still clutching the metal rail. His eyes warmed as he kissed her gloved fingers. \u201cIt makes you a selfless, generous angel. And it makes me wonder how I will ever deserve you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, and now a sweet, viscous emotion puddled in her belly. So rich, so indulgent, it made her feel a bit ill.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given me an idea,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. An inspiration, more like.\u201d He released her hand, then summoned the teashop waiter with a subtle nod. Bel watched as the two men conferred quietly. Then Toby returned to his side of the phaeton and vaulted into the seat. \u201cI have in mind an amusement, which I am positive will bring you great enjoyment. But it requires us to drive fast. Can you bear it?\u201d</p><p>Oh dear. Anticipation gleamed bright in his eyes, and Bel could not bring herself to dim it. She gave a brave nod and once again latched her fingers over the seat iron.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, glancing at her two-fisted grip as he gathered the reins. \u201cYou\u2019ll only feel more jounced about that way. Best to hold onto my arm.\u201d</p><p>He offered his elbow, and Bel stared at it. \u201cIf you insist...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>She threaded one arm through his, linking her hands around his upper arm. The waiter emerged from the teashop bearing a large hamper, which Toby directed him to secure behind the phaeton seat. Then, with a clipped word from their master, the horses jolted into motion. Bel clutched at Toby\u2019s arm as they turned out into the street. His muscles flexed under her fingers, and a thrill shot through her.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d he shouted, urging the horses faster.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed in a weak voice. When collision with an approaching barouche seemed imminent, Bel suppressed a cry of alarm and clamped her eyes shut.</p><p>Oh, this was much better in the dark.</p><p>He was right. The jolts of the carriage felt less pronounced now that she gripped his arm rather than the metal frame. Leaning into him, she endeavored to make her body pliant, weightless. Soon she learned how a small flex of his arm or shift of his weight preceded any alteration in course. The easy command he displayed soothed her concern, as did the familiar, sophisticated scent of his cologne. Yet they also stirred her, in some deep, undeniably feminine way. The more she became aware of his strength, the more her own body softened in response. She coasted along with the rocking motions of the carriage, the fear in her belly replaced by a new sensation ... a dark, sweet hunger that built and built.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he announced, drawing the team to a halt.</p><p>Surely we\u2019re not, thought Bel, feeling a profound sense of interruption. Wherever this wave of sensation was carrying her, she couldn\u2019t possibly be more than halfway along. She opened her eyes. A forbidding brick-and-stone fa\u00e7ade rose up before them. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dr. David\u2019s dispensary for children.\u201d He tossed the reins to a groom and slid down from the seat. \u201cQuickly now,\u201d he said, hurrying around to help her down. Puzzled, she watched him beckon a manservant from the dispensary\u2019s entrance. Together, the men worked to unstrap the hamper from the back of the carriage.</p><p>Toby grabbed her by the wrist, pulling her toward the entrance. \u201cHurry along. We don\u2019t want it to melt.\u201d</p><p>Bel followed him, mute with confusion, as they entered a cool, ceramic-tiled foyer and made a sharp left. Behind them, the manservant trotted to keep up, bearing the hamper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis way, then.\u201d Toby led them up a twisting flight of stairs and down a narrow corridor. A variety of unpleasant scents battled for prominence: sickness, laudanum, vinegar. Finally they emerged into a narrow ward lined with small beds on either side. In each bed lay a pale-faced, wide-eyed waif, frozen in an unnatural attitude of innocence. They wore the smug expressions of children interrupted in the midst of an illicit game and quite satisfied with their success at concealing it.</p><p>At Toby\u2019s direction, the servant began opening the hamper. Toby strode to the center of the room, clapping his hands. \u201cAll right, children. Time for medicine.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of groans rose up from the beds. A thin voice protested, \u201cWe already had our medicine!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, yes. But this is a different medicine. Especially ordered by your new nurse, Miss Grayson.\u201d He turned to Bel and gave her a frown that she immediately recognized as an exaggerated mirror of her own expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know she looks stern. But I promise, she\u2019s soft as kittens inside.\u201d He went to the hamper and pushed aside a layer of straw, then a sheet of waxed parchment. Inside, rows of pastel ices glistened like jewels. Toby lifted out two frosted glass dishes and held them out to Bel. \u201cHere,\u201d he whispered. \u201cEnjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Impossible man. Surely these children had other, more urgent needs he might have addressed, rather than spending money on this extravagant treat: bandages, linens, nourishing food, real medicine. But just like the children, he looked so pleased with his own mischief. And so handsome besides. Smiling, she took the ices from his hands.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my girl,\u201d he said, giving her a little wink. A correspondingly girlish thrill swept through her. Turning, he called to the room, \u201cWho likes strawberry?\u201d</p><p>The resulting clamor persisted for a good quarter hour, as the ices were distributed and demolished by the eager children. Bel seated herself at the bedside of a spindly-limbed boy sporting bandages on both arms, feeding him spoonfuls of apricot-flavored ice. The rapturous expression on his face warmed her heart.</p><p>Toby joined her, sitting on the other side of the boy\u2019s bed. \u201cWell? Are you enjoying yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know I am. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ward houses the children who are nearly ready to be released. Perhaps next time we\u2019ll visit some of the truly miserable ones. You\u2019ll be in perfect ecstasy, I predict.\u201d</p><p>Bel looked back at the bandaged child. He had fallen asleep, a cherubic smile on his face. \u201cPeter Jeffers, aged nine, ward of Charlesbridge-Crewe Chimney Sweeps,\u201d she read from a slate tacked to the boy\u2019s headboard. \u201cAged nine? Why, he looks no more than five or six!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderfed, most likely. Climbing boys have to be thin, or they won\u2019t fit up the flues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp the flues? What ever do you mean, up the flues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose they don\u2019t burn coal in the West Indies?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, these boys, they climb up the chimneys with brushes to remove the soot. The flues are narrow and often clogged, so it\u2019s dangerous work. This one must have suffered some burns.\u201d</p><p>Bel noted the bandages on the boy\u2019s forearms, and on his elbows above them, gnarled calluses with the texture of gravel. Observing the old, yellowed bruise on the child\u2019s jaw, she whispered, \u201cNot only burned, but beaten too.\u201d She shut her eyes, imagining the horror of being wedged into a soot-clogged chimney two bricks wide. \u201cAnd when he is healed, he will be released again to his employers? Only to be injured again, or maimed or killed? Can nothing be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a society, with a ridiculously long name, devoted to replacing the climbing boys with modern machinery. My sister Augusta is a member, but thus far I think they have met with little success. Climbing boys are the traditional method of cleaning flues, and we English do cling to our traditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraditions.\u201d Bel spat the word. \u201cAbominations, more like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d Toby tilted his head toward the boy, who stirred in his sleep. \u201cYou\u2019ll wake him.\u201d</p><p>Bel pressed her lips together, fuming in silence.</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, then leaned toward her across the bed. \u201cDo you know,\u201d he whispered, \u201cthat you\u2019re uncommonly beautiful when you\u2019re angry?\u201d</p> <p>Bel sniffed. What a time for trite compliments. \u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you admit to being beautiful. Very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Cringing, she lowered her voice. \u201cI do not admit to being beautiful, either.\u201d Possessed of a provocative figure, perhaps. But not beautiful.</p><p>\u201cCome now. If you will not admit to beauty, I must accuse you of dishonesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not dis\u2014\u201d She frowned and narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cAre you teasing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone so serious again. It\u2019s as though the misery of the world settles on your shoulders. If I don\u2019t tease you, I shall have to kiss you.\u201d He flashed her a sly grin. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to shock the children.\u201d</p><p>Bel\u2019s pulse raced. It was appalling, that he could even think of kissing in a place like this. Worse, now she was thinking of it too. How his lips had felt against hers last night, the flavor of brandy in his kiss. How would he taste if he kissed her this morning? Not of brandy, surely. What a man she meant to marry\u2014by turns insufferably vain and appallingly shallow, but so charming through it all. And so attractive ... She\u2019d been disappointed in his vanity earlier, but now Bel gave thanks for Toby\u2019s flawed character. She might be plagued by desire for him, but at least she would be in no danger of falling in love.</p><p>\u201cHow is it you thought to bring me here?\u201d she asked. \u201cSurely most gentlemen don\u2019t make it a habit to visit the children\u2019s dispensary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be perfectly honest, it\u2019s not at all a habit for me. I\u2019m a governor of the facility by virtue of a ten-guinea donation, but I\u2019ve only been here twice and I never attend the meetings. It\u2019s actually my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d</p><p>The double doors of the ward flung open. A hush smothered the room. Somewhere, a spoon clattered to the floor.</p><p>Bel looked up to see an elegant matron silhouetted in the door. High cheekbones lifted a face creased from decades of smiles, and her brows were thin, graceful sweeps. Her moss-green gown was exquisitely tailored, yet simple in style and topped by a dark-gray cloak and a mantle of extreme self-possession. Even the swish of her garments bespoke confidence as she strode forward to stand at the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cSir Tobias Aldridge,\u201d she addressed him sternly. \u201cWould you care to explain yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said smoothly, rising to his feet. Bel followed suit, shaking out her skirt as she stood. \u201cBut first, allow me to make the introductions. May I present Miss Isabel Grayson?</p><p>Isabel, this is Lydia, Lady Aldridge. My mother.\u201d</p><p>Numb with surprise, Bel made an inelegant curtsy. His mother! Well, of course she supposed she\u2019d be meeting his family soon, but she\u2019d expected to be prepared for the occasion. Did Lady Aldridge have any idea of their engagement? She didn\u2019t seem to, judging by the brief, indifferent glance she spared Bel.</p><p>\u201cMother compensates for my inattention as governor,\u201d Toby explained. \u201cShe comes here every Thursday, when she is in Town.\u201d</p><p>Bel looked from mother to son. Had this meeting been his entire design in bringing her here?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted to make your acquaintance, Lady Aldridge.\u201d</p><p>Toby reached across the bed and grasped her hand. \u201cMother, Isabel and I are engaged. We\u2019re going to marry in June.\u201d</p><p>Around them, the children burst into whistles and applause. Bel looked to Lady Aldridge, steeling herself against an outpouring of displeasure.</p><p>Lady Aldridge fixed her son with a look of mock reproach. \u201cToby. You really are impossible.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Bel, eyeing the empty dish in her hand and the sated child sleeping in the bed.</p><p>\u201cVery well, I approve.\u201d She skirted the bed and grasped Bel lightly by the shoulders before placing a kiss on her cheek. \u201cCome to the house for Sunday dinner, dear.\u201d She spoke over her shoulder to Toby.</p><p>\u201cShe can meet Augusta and Reginald if she comes Sunday. Of course, we\u2019ll have to arrange a more lavish occasion than roasted chicken to draw Margaret to Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Toby replied. \u201cWill Fanny and Edgar make it for the wedding, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn June?\u201d Lady Aldridge pursed her lips. \u201cI should think so. The babe will be six months old by then.\u201d</p><p>Bel watched this mother-son exchange with wonderment. The way they\u2019d forgotten her almost instantly, just gone on discussing family matters as if she weren\u2019t even there\u2014it was remarkable. Her gaze fell to the maltreated urchin in the bed, then rose again to Toby\u2019s charming, easy grin ...</p><p>And suddenly, she understood.</p><p>He simply couldn\u2019t know. Toby could view this miserable waif, feel a small, inconvenient twinge of sympathy, and then go on discussing kisses and weddings as if nothing had happened\u2014because nothing of the sort had ever happened, to him. One had only to observe the easy, loving repartee between Toby and his mother to see it. He could not know how it felt, to be a lonely, friendless child. He would never understand what it was, to receive beatings at the hand of a trusted adult\u2014to fear the same person he most loved in the world. No, Toby\u2019s world was Sunday dinners with Augusta and Reginald, newborn babies with two living parents, and an efficient, gracious mother who smelled of lavender and dispensed warm kisses, never blows.</p><p>And neither he nor his mother could realize the small miracle that had just occurred, when they\u2019d invited Bel to join them. To come by the house Sunday and dine on roast chicken, served up with dishes more exotic and tempting than any flavored ice: stability, affection, normalcy.</p><p>For the first time, Bel realized marriage meant more than choosing a husband. It meant acquiring a family.</p><p>How unexpected. How ... wonderful.</p><p>Toby\u2019s hand squeezed hers. \u201cAre you well, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cJust... a bit surprised.\u201d</p><p>Lady Aldridge patted her cheek, as if she knew how much Bel craved a maternal touch. \u201cOh, I know we can be overwhelming at first. You\u2019ll grow accustomed to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain I will.\u201d Bel cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m so gratified to see the good work you do here, at the dispensary. Might I accompany you on your weekly visits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel is devoted to charity,\u201d Toby said.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course she is.\u201d Lady Aldridge gave her son a beatific smile. \u201cShe\u2019s marrying you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cWill you take more chicken, Isabel?\u201d</p><p>Toby gave the nearest footman a significant look. The servant immediately extended a liveried sleeve toward the domed platter.</p><p>Isabel warned him off with a little shake of her head. \u201cThank you, no. I am quite satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Lady Aldridge asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve been having dinner with us for weeks now, and you seem to grow a bit thinner every Sunday.\u201d She turned to Toby. \u201cYou must be certain she\u2019s eating properly. It won\u2019t do to have her fainting dead away in the middle of your wedding ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d His sister Augusta smiled. \u201cImagine what the papers would say then.\u201d</p><p>Across the table, her husband laughed. \u201cYes, our Mr. Hollyhurst would have great sport with that one, after what happened the last time. Betrothal to Toby would be declared a public health concern, on par with smallpox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch yourself, Reginald,\u201d Toby said, giving his brother-in-law a look of limited forbearance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps I will take a bit more.\u201d Isabel extended her plate, and the footman served her another helping. \u201cThank you, Jamison.\u201d</p><p>As Bel ate, Toby studied his intended bride for any signs of embarrassment. He found none. Amazing, how easily she\u2019d fallen into the pattern of their family life. Most ladies would have been mortified to have their health or eating habits questioned in company, but Isabel never appeared to mind Lady Aldridge\u2019s presumptive mothering or Reginald\u2019s brash humor. She seemed only eager to become a part of the family madness, teasing and all. She even knew the footmen by name.</p><p>No, he noted no flush of humiliation or displeasure. But his mother was right, Isabel did look a trifle pale. Heart-stoppingly beautiful, as always. But pale.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re overtired,\u201d he said, taking the excuse to stroke the underside of her wrist. Her skin was so soft there. \u201cBetween the wedding preparations and your weekly visits to the dispensary, and then those meetings with Augusta\u2019s Society of the Ridiculously Long Name</p><p>...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so long,\u201d his older sister protested. \u201cIt\u2019s the Society for Obviating the Necessity of Climbing Boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now, that\u2019s not even all of it.\u201d Reginald forked a small potato into his mouth. \u201cToby\u2019s right, it goes on and on. It\u2019s a wonder you accomplish any business at those meetings. Once the name has been read aloud for the record, it must be time to adjourn. What is it, the Society for Obviating the Necessity of Climbing Boys, By Encouraging a New Method of Sweeping Chimneys and for Improving the Condition of Children, and so on and so on ad infinitum ...\u201d</p><p>Augusta gave her husband a sharp look. \u201cI refuse to be lectured on verbosity by England\u2019s most long-winded barrister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat ever the name,\u201d Toby interjected, \u201cperhaps Isabel ought to leave off attending the meetings and the dispensary, at least until after the wedding and honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Isabel\u2019s fork clattered to her plate. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly. Those poor children, Toby</p><p>... you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand. I understand that you are a selfless, generous angel who would put the most pitiful wretch\u2019s health above her own. But if you don\u2019t look after yourself, I shall be forced to look after you. I will insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForced? Insist?\u201d Augusta gave him an amused glance. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit barbaric, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely what is barbaric about expressing concern for my future wife\u2019s health?\u201d Toby set down his wineglass, a bit more forcefully than he\u2019d intended.</p> <p>Everyone\u2019s eyes fell to the table. In unison, each person lifted a glass and drank. Slowly.</p><p>\u201cToby is only teasing,\u201d Isabel said. \u201cHe knows how important my charitable causes are to me.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Toby sighed. He knew. Those damnable causes were everything to her. For weeks now, Isabel had declined any typical amusement, finding pleasure only in visiting orphans and collecting charitable subscriptions. Even the wedding preparations were a task she suffered through, he suspected. She probably thought of lepers while she looked at samples of lace.</p><p>\u201cHow are things in Surrey, Mother?\u201d he asked, desperate to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cWell, as always.\u201d Lady Aldridge motioned for the footmen to clear the table. \u201cExcept for one minor annoyance.\u201d</p><p>Reginald chortled. \u201cNeed we guess the annoyance\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>Toby asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s Mr. Yorke done this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s the plans for the irrigation canal. He agreed to the placement months ago. Now that the papers have been drawn up he refuses to sign, the impossible man. I know he does these things just to spite me. Toby, you\u2019ll have to speak with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCertainly I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always liked you. Though I never understood why.\u201d</p><p>With a self-effacing smile, Toby laid down his fork. \u201cThis, from my own mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t mean it that way, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014that man doesn\u2019t like anyone.\u201d</p><p>Archibald Yorke owned the lands bordering their estate in Surrey. He was a fixture in the neighborhood, known for his dry wit and shrewd bargains, and as the other primary landholder in the borough, he\u2019d taken some pride in his position as the Aldridge family\u2019s archnemesis. Because Toby had assumed the baronetcy in his infancy, for many years, the task of dealing with Mr. Yorke had fallen to his mother. Now their scuffling had simply become a matter of habit, a sport neither party seemed inclined to give up. Despite the history of rancor between the two\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014Toby had always liked the man immensely. In his youth, he\u2019d been drawn to the prickly old bachelor. They\u2019d spent many an afternoon in Yorke\u2019s stables or by the fishing stream. In keeping with his life goal of thwarting Lady Aldridge, Yorke had provided young Toby with sanctuary and a sympathetic ear anytime he fled a punishment or simply chafed on his mother\u2019s leading strings.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mr. Yorke?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d Toby replied.</p><p>At the same instant, Augusta answered, \u201cMother\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a neighbor,\u201d their mother said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not worth further discussion. Let us speak of pleasanter things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Augusta,\u201d Isabel said, brightening. As ever, charity absorbed her complete attention. \u201cI have an idea for the Society pamphlets. My sister-in-law, Soph\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off. Forks teetered midair.</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d his mother completed smoothly. \u201cWe know Sophia, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course you do,\u201d Isabel murmured. She cast a guilty look at Toby. He forced a smile and a wave of nonchalance. \u201cGo on then, darling,\u201d he said, although he hoped she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSophia has agreed to sketch a portrait of little Peter Jeffers, to illustrate the pamphlet. We must put a human face to the climbing boys\u2019 misery, to stir the hearts of potential donors. Augusta, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a splendid idea,\u201d Augusta answered. \u201cCan your sister provide a sample before the next meeting?\u201d</p><p>And on and on it went through dessert\u2014which, of course, Isabel did not eat. Toby stabbed at his portion of quince tart. It wasn\u2019t that he begrudged Isabel her good deeds\u2014he just wished she\u2019d warm up to him a bit. After nearly six weeks, he was still clinging to this betrothal by the skin of his teeth and an arm-long list of absurd promises.</p><p>By his own agreement with Gray, he had to keep Isabel smiling. And none of his usual methods\u2014compliments, jests, fawning attention, little gifts\u2014earned even the slightest twitch of her lips. No, there was nothing to make Isabel Grayson smile like an impetuous act of selfdenial: Yes, of course I\u2019ll raise funds for the dispensary\u2019s new building.</p><p>Though I\u2019d just as soon pay for the thing myself.</p><p>Certainly, I\u2019ll canvass the gentlemen\u2019s club for subscriptions.</p><p>The day they terminate my membership.</p><p>Absolutely, I\u2019ll let grimy gutter waifs ride on my shoulders.</p><p>Can\u2019t I just give them a pony instead?</p><p>No, I didn\u2019t notice the children had fleas.</p><p>Scratch, scratch, scratch ...</p><p>Charity was all well and good, but Isabel\u2019s version of it was extreme. If he made it to their wedding before completely impoverishing or debasing himself, it would be a small miracle. Of course, Toby would promise Isabel damn near anything now. Once they were safely married, he could negotiate different terms. But it bewildered him that even after weeks, none of his romantic overtures swayed her in the least. By what cruel twist of fate had he proposed to the one woman in creation who remained immune to all his practiced charm?</p><p>Well, if he was honest with himself, Toby had to admit there were apparently two women in creation who were immune to his charms. And the first had already jilted him. Isabel said, \u201cI long for the day we can disband the Society altogether.\u201d</p><p>Now that remark piqued Toby\u2019s attention. There was a sentiment he could wholeheartedly endorse.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Augusta agreed. \u201cIf only Parliament would pass meaningful restrictions on child labor, none of these efforts would be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Reginald interrupted. \u201cI smell a new charitable venture in the offing. The Society for Obviating the Necessity of the Society for the Obviating the Necessity of Climbing Boys ...\u201d</p><p>Isabel gave a soft laugh. \u201cNo, no. There is no need for another Society. Once Toby assumes his place in Parliament, he will take up that cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby,\u201d Reginald echoed. \u201cIn Parliament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>With an unladylike burst of laughter, Augusta turned to him. \u201cHas Mr. Yorke heard of this?</p><p>Toby, she can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugusta.\u201d Toby inhaled slowly through his nose. \u201cIsabel is always serious.\u201d</p><p>Of course, the notion of him serving in Parliament was patently absurd, but he couldn\u2019t very well admit it. Not when Isabel looked at him with expectation in those dark, solemn eyes. Promise her anything. Keep her happy. Make her smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd on Isabel\u2019s counsel,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been giving the matter serious consideration.\u201d</p><p>Isabel didn\u2019t smile. She beamed, and Toby viewed the expression with profound gratitude and just a trace of alarm. God, what wouldn\u2019t he promise her, just to earn her approval? It was a good thing less than a month remained before a clergyman declared them man and wife, or she\u2019d have him renouncing all his worldly belongings and taking orders himself.</p><p>\u201cToby in Parliament,\u201d Lady Aldridge said in a tone of false innocence. \u201cWhat an idea.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a warning look over his wineglass. She\u2019d been hinting at him to challenge Mr. Yorke\u2019s seat in Commons for an age now, and he\u2019d been loudly denouncing the idea for an age and a half. Indulging his mother\u2019s petty vendetta was an even worse reason to seek office than appeasing his na\u00efve bride.</p><p>Now his mother fixed him with the most unnerving gaze, coupled with a serene smile. Just like a mother, to take an unnatural delight in watching her offspring squirm.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d he said in a conciliatory croon, \u201cyou\u2019ve ten grandchildren now\u2014three of them tearing apart the nursery as we speak. Might I suggest you sharpen that look on one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel,\u201d she finally said, still directing her smile at Toby, \u201chave we told you how delighted we are to welcome you to the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil\u2014\u201d</p><p>Josiah Grayson bit off the chain of curses uncoiling in his mind. Such language wasn\u2019t meant for a child\u2019s ears. But then, neither were children meant to be climbing atop their fathers\u2019 desks and emptying inkwells onto stacks of crucial correspondence.</p><p>Joss lunged for his son, scooping the boy off the polished cherrywood desktop now marred with inky fingerprints. He attempted to pry Jacob\u2019s chubby fingers from the inkwell, holding the wriggling urchin at arm\u2019s length so as not to spoil his own new topcoat. Damn Gray. This was all his fault for leaving London so soon. He\u2019d gone to Southampton to survey progress on two ships under construction, taking Sophia with him. Two days he\u2019d been gone, and already everything had gone to hell. Wouldn\u2019t the arrogant devil just love to know it, too? First, Jacob\u2019s nursemaid quitting her post, then problems with these insurance contracts, and to top it all off, Bel taken ill...</p><p>\u201cJacob, give that to Papa. I said, give it to Papa. Jacob, for the love of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the boy let go the inkwell. Bereft of resistance, Joss\u2019s arm snapped back at the elbow. Ink splattered him from cravat to trousers.</p><p>\u201cBlast, bugger, damn, and hell.\u201d There was no preventing the improper vocabulary lesson Jacob received then. Mara would have been furious with him for using that language in front of their son. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMrs. Prewitt.\u201d Joss summoned the housekeeper from the hallway and deposited Jacob in her reluctant embrace. \u201cClean him up and send him to Cook for a biscuit.\u201d</p><p>His son temporarily occupied, Joss turned his attention to the ink-spattered contracts covering his desk. God, what a mess. As partner in Grayson Brothers Shipping, Joss was fully empowered to sign the contracts and deal with the matter in Gray\u2019s absence. But it chafed him that he didn\u2019t truly understand the crux of the problem, had no idea whether he signed the new contract for good or ill. He had only the advice of their solicitor to work from, and Joss didn\u2019t trust that toadying prig with tuppence.</p><p>Not that Gray would have known any better how to handle the situation. His brother had no education in legal matters, either. This was why Joss was determined to study law. They couldn\u2019t build a successful family business unless one of them could look at these piles of legal prattle and make sense of them.</p> <p>The butler appeared in the entryway. \u201cA caller, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sir Toby Aldridge, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Joss muttered, sifting through a stack of parchment. Just what he needed\u2014the task of entertaining that insufferable ass in addition to everything else. \u201cDidn\u2019t he get the message that Bel\u2019s taken ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d a voice said from the corridor. The insufferable ass himself rounded the doorway and entered the study. \u201cAll the more reason for me to call.\u201d</p> <p>Joss dismissed the butler with a look. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come back another day,\u201d he told Toby, sitting down to his desk. \u201cShe\u2019s feeling too poorly for social calls, and I\u2019m in no humor for them either.\u201d</p><p>Toby flopped into a chair opposite. \u201cDon\u2019t treat me as if I\u2019m some stranger off the street. I\u2019m marrying Isabel in less than a month, for God\u2019s sake. Now, what\u2019s the nature of her illness?</p><p>Has a doctor been called? Can I see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a sore throat,\u201d Joss said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want a doctor. And no, you can\u2019t see her.\u201d</p><p>The butler appeared in the doorway again. \u201cThe Countess of Kendall and a Miss Osborne, for Miss Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them I\u2019ll be there momentarily. I\u2019ll show them up to Miss Grayson\u2019s chambers myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow see here.\u201d Toby rose from his chair. \u201cYou just said she\u2019s not to receive callers. Why can Lucy and her friend go up, and not me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Bel asked to see them. She didn\u2019t ask to see you.\u201d Joss brushed past Toby and walked down the corridor to the entryway. Toby\u2019s footsteps followed him to the foyer, where Lucy waited. Joss bowed to the countess first. \u201cPlease excuse my appearance,\u201d he said, gesturing toward his ruined attire. \u201cThe work of my son, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard young Master Jacob is a handful.\u201d Her gaze drifted over Joss\u2019s shoulder. \u201cToby, what a pleasant surprise. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should it be such a surprise? Wouldn\u2019t any gentleman call on his invalid intended?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring Toby\u2019s complaint, Lucy continued, \u201cMiss Osborne, this is Miss Grayson\u2019s brother, Captain Josiah Grayson, and her betrothed, Sir Toby Aldridge. Gentlemen, allow me to introduce my friend, Miss Hetta Osborne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Osborne. You are welcome.\u201d Joss bowed to the newcomer, a young lady a few years older than Bel, dressed in a simple muslin frock and a curry-colored spencer. He straightened to find her regarding him with intense, unwavering curiosity. Joss suppressed the urge to pull a face, call attention to her rudeness.</p><p>\u201cMiss Obsorne\u2019s come to stay with me through my confinement. Her father is the doctor at Corbinsdale. When Bel sent word that she\u2019d been taken ill, I immediately thought to bring Hetta with me.\u201d Lucy laid a gloved hand on her friend\u2019s arm. \u201cMiss Osborne\u2019s practically a physician in her own right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA female physician?\u201d Now Joss enjoyed his turn to stare. Miss Osborne was a compact, efficiently made sort of woman. In manner and bearing, she had the air of a matron, but girlish freckles dusted her milk-white complexion. Indeed, she stared with all the unabashed curiosity of a child, but intelligence sharpened her eyes\u2014eyes that were a warm shade of hazel. They gave him pause.</p> <p>It had been a long time since Joss had noticed the color of a woman\u2019s eyes. Lately, a cursory glance was all he spared any new acquaintance before slotting the person into one of two categories: \u201cTolerate\u201d or \u201cDismiss.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t sure yet how to categorize this woman. He needed a closer look. Thus, he found himself studying her appearance with undue concentration.</p><p>He found himself noting that her eyes were a rather appealing shade of hazel, flecked with green.</p><p>Behind him, Toby made a sound of derision. \u201cPractically a physician? If Isabel is ill, she\u2019s going to be seen by a real doctor. I\u2019ll send my own personal physician.\u201d</p><p>Miss Osborne lifted her chin. \u201cThe only reason I cannot claim the title \u2018physician\u2019 is my sex. I\u2019ve received the same benefit of education and experience as any of my male counterparts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs any country quack, you mean.\u201d Toby turned to Joss. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously mean to entrust your sister\u2019s health to this ... this girl.\u201d</p><p>Lucy grasped her friend\u2019s arm. \u201cHetta, don\u2019t be offended. Toby doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s just upset over Bel\u2019s illness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d Miss Osborne fixed Toby with a withering look. \u201cI\u2019m well acquainted with the irrational behaviors gentlemen exhibit when their ladies are ailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrrational behaviors?\u201d Joss said. \u201cIt\u2019s irrational for a man to display concern?\u201d Now Miss Osborne was truly becoming a problem. She was making him side with Toby. Much as he begrudged Toby any consideration, Joss understood all too well the agony of watching\u2014at least, hearing\u2014a woman suffer. \u201cOne would think you\u2019d have some sympathy,\u201d he said. She gave a one-shouldered shrug. \u201cSympathy would imply understanding, and I\u2019ve never understood why women are labeled the weaker sex. In my observation, males suffer the condition of helplessness with far less courage than females suffer pain.\u201d</p><p>Her grip tightened on a small black valise. \u201cAs for me, I do not suffer ignorance. I came here to attend Miss Grayson. I assure you, I have the training and experience to provide her with excellent care, despite the efforts of some\u201d\u2014she shot a look at Toby\u2014\u201cto limit me, simply because of physical characteristics given me at birth.\u201d Her eyes flashed as she turned to Joss.</p><p>\u201cOne would think you\u2019d have some sympathy.\u201d</p><p>Well.</p><p>Joss inhaled slowly, considering. This Miss Osborne was either an impolitic fool or an example of cleverness. A physician, did she call herself? In a minute\u2019s time, she\u2019d managed sharp pokes to both of his raw, open wounds\u2014his lingering grief over Mara\u2019s death, and his frustration with the restrictions that accompanied his mixed parentage and illegitimacy. For a purported healer, she was a real pain.</p><p>Now she had the temerity to suggest he should reward her acid nature, endorse her abilities just because they shared this tenuous link of skirting social convention. As if it made them allies. He could not deny her access to Bel, Miss Osborne\u2019s gaze insisted, without impugning his own intelligence.</p><p>His alternative, of course, would be to deny her skills as a physician and turn her away\u2014</p><p>thereby siding with Toby. Joss suppressed a growl of annoyance. It was a devil\u2019s bargain, either way.</p><p>Miss Osborne knew it, too. As they stared one another down, her thin eyebrows arched with anticipation. Oh, she was clever. The woman was no fool.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Joss made a dismissive bow. \u201cMrs. Prewitt will show you to my sister\u2019s chambers.\u201d Damned if he\u2019d do it himself.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Lucy smiled, in an obvious effort to dispel the tension. Watching Miss Osborne ascend the stairs, she whispered, \u201cPlease don\u2019t mind Hetta. She rather delights in being shocking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Lady Kendall.\u201d As Lucy followed her friend above-stairs, Joss turned back to his study. Miss Osborne did not know her good fortune, to be able to choose the occasions on which she gave offense. People found Joss shocking as a matter of course, whether he delighted in it or not.</p><p>Toby\u2019s smooth voice stopped him halfway down the corridor. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re permitting this.\u201d</p><p>Joss sighed. Would the man never leave?</p><p>Toby continued, \u201cAnd here I thought you were the intelligent brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were smooth with ladies. You didn\u2019t display any of that reputed charm with Miss Osborne. After the way you insulted her, I could scarcely turn her away. Poorly done, Aldridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, leave off.\u201d Toby lowered his voice as he closed the distance between them. \u201cIf a dead wife entitles you to become a full-time prick, I should think an invalid betrothed earns me a moment of incivility. If Isabel\u2019s condition fails to improve\u2014or God forbid, worsens\u2014I will send for my doctor immediately, and you will have hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>Joss stared at him. He\u2019d never heard that tone from the man before. What a day this was. Mangled contracts, tipped inkwells, female doctors ... and now this insufferable ass began to demand his respect. Worse, Joss felt compelled to give it. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now agree to let me see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would let you see her. If\u2014\u201d Toby was three risers up the stairs before that \u201cif\u201d halted him mid-step. \u201cIf she wished it. But she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, she doesn\u2019t? I\u2019m going to be her husband in three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your wife yet. For now, she\u2019s just my sister. And my sister doesn\u2019t want to see you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>\u201cThere you are. At last.\u201d</p><p>Bel looked up from her reading. Toby stood at the entrance to her private sitting room, holding a parcel under one arm and stealing the thoughts straight from her mind. There he was. At last.</p><p>She wished she could stand to greet him, but her head was spinning. Throughout her illness, she\u2019d suffered bouts of dizziness. Spying his dashing figure in the doorway only made matters worse. Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to see him so soon, but she\u2019d been putting him off for more than a week now.</p><p>She laid aside the newspaper, forcing her lips into a tight smile. Oh, how she longed for him to turn away, so she might pinch a blush to her cheeks. Maybe she could manage the appearance of better health, if not the corresponding strength.</p><p>But she could tell, Toby was having none of it. \u201cHow pale you are,\u201d he said, placing his parcel on the table and sinking onto the divan next to her. He made an impetuous motion as though he would embrace her, then seemed to think better of it. Bel didn\u2019t know whether to be grateful or disappointed.</p><p>He asked, \u201cDo you know how sick I\u2019ve been with worry? I\u2019ve come by the house every day, you know. Why wouldn\u2019t you allow me to see you?\u201d</p><p>Warm brown eyes scanned her appearance. Bel felt his gaze catching on the dark circles beneath her eyes, the sallow tone of her cheeks, the dull texture of her hair. She must be hideous, and of course he looked as suave and handsome as ever.</p><p>\u201cHow could I have allowed you? It isn\u2019t proper.\u201d She fidgeted with the handkerchief in her lap, picking at the tatted edge. It wasn\u2019t quite a lie; just an incomplete truth. She couldn\u2019t very well tell him honestly, I couldn\u2019t let you see me until I felt completely assured of my sanity. She\u2019d spent days floating in and out of feverish dreams, terrified that, like her mother, she would never fully return from them. Even once the fever left her, she\u2019d lain awake in bed all night, scouring the darkest corners of her mind for any flitting moths of madness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019d visited, it would only have caused you distress,\u201d she said feebly. \u201cEven now, I must look so ill.\u201d She put one hand to her temple, shielding her face.</p><p>He ducked, peering under it. \u201cIsabel, listen to me. We are to be married in a couple of weeks. I\u2019m going to stand before all London, the Holy Trinity, and even those two boorish brothers of yours and pledge you my undying fidelity and protection. In sickness and in health.\u201d He pulled her hand away from her face, folding his fingers around hers. \u201cAnd with God as my witness, I will vow to you right now\u2014you are the most beautiful sight I\u2019ve beheld in ten days.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t decide whether he was teasing her or deceiving her. But then, she didn\u2019t really want to know. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d she said quietly. That was the simple truth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad of it.\u201d He smiled. \u201cMiss Osborne tells me you\u2019ve made nearly a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my fever is completely gone. I\u2019m just a bit weak yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not taking enough food, she says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... it\u2019s still painful to eat,\u201d she said. \u201cMy throat...\u201d She feigned a little cough, in lieu of completing the sentence.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, you must make an effort to regain your strength. I\u2019ve just spoken to your brother. He\u2019s suggesting we postpone the wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, he mustn\u2019t! I won\u2019t let him.\u201d Bel gripped his hand. \u201cI\u2019m feeling much improved already.\u201d</p><p>This, too, was the truth. Perhaps she had been wrong to keep him away so long. There was something about the way he looked at her, with that shadow of a smile in his eyes, that made her feel restored. His teasing infuriated her at times, but she was beginning to understand it as a strange sort of compliment to her character. While bullies teased to belittle and hurt, Toby\u2019s good-natured jibes had quite the opposite effect. He teased not out of malice, but because he believed she was strong enough to bear it.</p><p>And thus far, he had always been right.</p><p>She gave his fingers a little squeeze. \u201cThe wedding must go on as planned.\u201d</p><p>Relief was plain in the relaxation of his shoulders. He added his free hand to the tangle of their fingers, surrounding hers with his strong, warm touch. \u201cGood. To that end, I\u2019ve brought you some medicine.\u201d Releasing her, he reached for the parcel he\u2019d brought.</p><p>\u201cMedicine? But Miss Osborne has already dosed me with\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is a different sort of medicine. One you\u2019re sure to enjoy.\u201d A sly gleam stole into his eyes as he opened the package and withdrew a chilled glass dish mounded with a nut-brown ice.</p><p>\u201cThe flavor is chocolate. Blended with hazelnut and, I\u2019m told, a hint of cinnamon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby, really ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist.\u201d He pressed a spoon into her hand. \u201cIf it pains you to eat solid food, you must take what you can. An ice is the perfect remedy for a sore throat. The coolness is a balm; the sweetness is a restorative.\u201d He gave her a wicked smile. \u201cAnd everyone knows chocolate to be invigorating.\u201d</p><p>Bel could already feel her resistance melting. The glistening ice looked so cool, so inviting. Her raw throat worked as she imagined taking just one spoonful of chilled, soothing sweetness.</p><p>\u201cI... I couldn\u2019t possibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it the sugar that concerns you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, hoping he would take pity on her conscience and quickly pack the dish away. He pressed it closer, taking the spoon from her hand and scooping up a bite of the ice. \u201cIsabel, don\u2019t be concerned. I ordered this ice specially made for you. It\u2019s sweetened with honey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, pure English honey, collected from very contented bees. I interviewed the beekeeper myself, and he assured me the drones were treated most fairly, paid an honest wage, and given the Sabbath to rest. And now that they\u2019ve done their service, I\u2019ve arranged for the whole hive to be pensioned off to a charming little beech grove in Shropshire, right next to a meadow abundant with clover. So you see,\u201d he said, moving the spoon toward her lips, \u201cyou may partake of this ice in good conscience.\u201d</p><p>Bel giggled. For heaven\u2019s sake, she never giggled. With those smooth arguments and that persuasive grin, he was bound to be a terrific success in Parliament. \u201cYou are teasing me. Most shamelessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And you\u2019re enjoying it.\u201d Leaning closer, he lifted the spoon to her mouth. \u201cReally, Isabel. You must eat. You must get well, if we are to marry as planned, and ...\u201d His voice took on a sudden, thrilling intensity. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t wish to delay.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. If she were truly strong, she would find it in herself to push the temptation away. But she was ill and weak, and though she knew in her conscience she shouldn\u2019t give in</p><p>She did.</p><p>Her lips closed around the chilled spoon, and she drew on it with light suction, pulling the frozen confection into her mouth.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh, paradise.</p><p>At first, the cold burned her lips and tongue, and the ice crystals abraded her palate like small slivers of glass. But then the sharp edges melted to cream, and each tiny excoriation was now soothed, with exquisite coolness and a dark, bittersweet spice.</p><p>Swallowing, she opened her eyes to find him offering her a second spoonful. This bite she accepted with eyes wide open, held rapt by his warm, amber-flecked gaze as the oscillation of sharp pain and rich pleasure teased her senses again.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked, slowly retracting the spoon from between her pursed lips. Did she? Bel licked her lips, considering. She couldn\u2019t describe the sensation as wholly pleasant, but she knew one thing. \u201cI want more.\u201d</p><p>He gave a hoarse chuckle\u2014a sound more throaty and raw than his usual laugh. As he lifted another bite to her lips, Bel watched his dark pupils widening with anticipation, his full lips parting in unison with hers. He seemed to experience the same sweet torture she did, as the burning cold flooded her mouth. Once again, he dragged the spoon from between her lips. And for some unknown, wicked reason, Bel found herself pursing them tighter in defiance. As if to tease.</p><p>She licked her lips again, slowly, taking joy in the way his gaze riveted to her mouth. Yes, she felt strong when he teased her, but teasing him back ... this was power. The sensation rushed through the top of her head, like cold.</p><p>When he spoke, his voice was husky. \u201cMay I taste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she blurted out. How thoughtless she\u2019d been, not to offer before he could ask. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Instead of dipping the spoon again, however, Toby set the dish aside. And before Bel even knew what was happening, his hands were framing her jaw, angling her face to his. And then his body was flush against hers, his lips covering hers, and his tongue ... His tongue was inside her mouth, teasing hers. Tasting.</p><p>Shocked, Bel closed her eyes. This felt so good, it had to be wrong. She ought to push this temptation away. She shouldn\u2019t give in.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>And she discovered that her future husband tasted even better than chocolate. His mouth moved confidently over hers as his tongue swept between her lips, in and out. The effect was dizzying. Her breath rushed out in a little whimpering sigh. Toby\u2019s hands relaxed where they clasped her face, and his lips paused against hers in a deceptively innocent kiss. He was offering her a chance to resist. An opportunity to pull away. But as with the ice, she wasn\u2019t satisfied with one taste of him. Maybe that fever had done something to her. She knew it was wrong, but she wanted more.</p><p>Her hands flew around his neck, threading into the locks of his hair where it met his cravat. As he renewed the kiss, she allowed her fingers to explore. How long she\u2019d been wanting to touch him like this! His hair felt every bit as sleek as it looked, and the muscles of his neck were delightfully solid. And his skin ... When she slid one fingertip beneath his starched neckcloth, she discovered his skin to be smooth and hot and just a bit damp with perspiration. A new thrill went through her, to know that beneath his confident exterior, he was simply a man, raw and elemental. And she made him sweat.</p><p>\u201cIsabel.\u201d</p><p>He murmured the name against her mouth, sliding his hands down to her waist and pulling her close. When her breasts met his chest, a little moan escaped them both. But this time, Toby offered her no gentleness, no chance to retreat. No, he had become a true man of purpose, pulling her tighter still and taking her mouth with a possessive hunger. His kiss tasted dark and desperate, and it was undeniably flattering, how much he seemed to want her. That no matter how much she offered him, he took more, and still more. His mouth moved again and again over hers, his tongue thrusting in and out as he clutched her waist with both hands. And then ...</p><p>Oh, and then.</p><p>He began to slide one hand up. So slowly, so stealthily. His thumb lingered over each rib. With every inch his touch crept higher, Bel grew increasingly certain it would soon stop. It must stop.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t stop, this insidious, tantalizing caress that traveled up and up. And within her some forbidden sensation, some need, began to mount as well. It was as if all her awareness converged in her belly, following the rippling heat of his touch. Her breath grew shallow, and her fingers tightened around his neck. Somewhere in her mind, a shrill voice clamored for virtue, but she couldn\u2019t obey. The unbearable need climbed her from inside and out\u2014his touch, this sensation\u2014up and up ... and up.</p><p>His thumb grazed the underside of her breast.</p><p>Oh. Oh, please.</p><p>Bel didn\u2019t have the slightest idea what she was begging him for. But she was kissing him back now, arching her body and pouring that wordless plea into light motions of her lips and tentative sweeps of her tongue. He growled deep in his throat and rewarded her daring with another gentle caress up the side of her breast.</p><p>She clutched his neck tighter, kissed him harder. Telling him what she could never, ever bring herself to say in words.</p><p>Oh, please don\u2019t stop. Please do it again.</p><p>Her breasts ached. They were heavy, so heavy. She resented them, these useless, corsetstraining burdens she\u2019d been carrying around since the age of fourteen. And now, at long last, they seemed awakened to some purpose. Her nipples gathered to tight knots, straining against her bodice. Straining toward him. They hurt.</p><p>He could make it better. She knew he could.</p><p>Oh please. Oh please oh please oh please.</p><p>His hand cupped her breast. She nearly cried out with relief. His thumb found her nipple, and pleasure sang through her veins and curled between her thighs. So intense, she thought she might faint. With confident fingers, he stroked and kneaded, and Bel kissed him with every ounce of gratitude she possessed. They were heavy, so heavy\u2014but now he had taken the weight in his own strong hand, bearing it for her. Soothing the ache. It was everything wrong. But it was everything she needed. She needed him, and he had come, armed with chocolate and kisses and that teasing, devilish grin.</p><p>He was temptation incarnate, and she was giving in.</p><p>At last.</p><p>At last.</p><p>Toby thumbed her hardened nipple again, groaning into her mouth. How long had he been aching to hold these magnificent breasts? Since the evening they met\u2014weeks now, months. An eternity. God, how marvelously she filled his hand, the warm, soft flesh overflowing his cupped fingers. Desire pounded in his blood. He longed to push her back into the upholstery, wrench her free of this thin muslin bodice, and fasten his lips around the taut bud of her nipple. She would taste so good. These mewling, erotic noises she now made into his mouth ... she would make them aloud. Just the thought of it drove him into a frenzy. He\u2019d missed her, more than he could have expected. The need gripped him, to join with her\u2014</p><p>to carve out a home for himself in all that lush, generous femininity and never, ever leave. And though some fragment of reason in his melting brain insisted that there was no damned way he could deflower Isabel right here, right now, on her sitting room settee ... a distinctly baser portion of him quite desperately wanted to try. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was his, after all. She was marrying him in a matter of days, no matter what her brother said. The wedding must go on as planned. Those had been her words. The surge of triumphant pride only fueled his desire. He kneaded her breast greedily, relishing the way she arched into his touch, denying him nothing. Finally, she was responding to him\u2014not his forbearance with beggars or his philanthropic largesse. At last, here was that passion he\u2019d glimpsed at their very first meeting, all that pent-up emotion she buried under selfless good works. She might hide it from the world, even from herself. But she couldn\u2019t hide it from him. He had won her. She was his.</p><p>She would be his wife.</p><p>And ... and damned if he would steal her innocence like a thief. Not when she would soon belong to him, by rights.</p> <p>With great reluctance, Toby marshaled his will and released her breast. Framing her face in his palms, he gently pulled her away. Her labored breaths raced his. Resting his forehead against her lovely brow, he whispered, \u201cDarling, I\u2019m sorry. We really should stop.\u201d</p><p>He saw the flush of guilt creeping up her face.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. I know it, but...\u201d She chewed her lip. \u201cYou make me want to do things I know I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With a soft laugh, he pressed a kiss to her brow. \u201cFunny, isn\u2019t it? You make me want to do the things I\u2019ve always known I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we suit one another, do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSplendidly.\u201d And he meant it. The past few minutes had banished any of his concerns about their compatibility. During that kiss, they had suited one another to the ground. He couldn\u2019t resist stealing one more. And then another. Nuzzling her ear, he murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s a fortunate thing we\u2019re getting married soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She straightened and inched away, putting distance between them. Passion had been put aside, and her typically placid demeanor had returned. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t possibly wait any longer. I only wish we could marry today. I hope the timing of the wedding won\u2019t interfere with your campaign.\u201d</p><p>Toby blinked. \u201cMy ... my campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame, that we\u2019ll have to postpone the honeymoon. But I expect the Lake District will be just as lovely in August as it would have been in July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPostpone the honeymoon? What on earth are you talking about?\u201d Brushing a finger across the tip of her nose, he joked, \u201cIsabel, perhaps that fever affected you more seriously than we thought.\u201d</p><p>She went rigid, instantly. \u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he soothed. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d He slid his fingertip along her jaw. \u201cBut my word, you\u2019re so beautiful when you take offense. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s addled, darling. I don\u2019t seem to be following you. Take pity on a besotted fool and explain it again, a little more slowly.\u201d</p><p>Smiling again, she pulled a newspaper from the table beside her and held it out to him.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? The Prince Regent is expected to dissolve Parliament tomorrow. It\u2019s in all the newspapers. Polling will begin within a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Toby stared at the newspaper she\u2019d handed him, trying in vain to form a response. She couldn\u2019t possibly be serious. Isabel laid a hand on his sleeve, and his gaze jerked up to hers.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it perfect?\u201d she said, a smile spreading across her face. \u201cOur grand wedding, followed so closely by your candidacy? We\u2019re certain to be the talk of London, if not all England. At last, you\u2019ll have your place in the House of Commons, and I\u2019ll be ...\u201d She blushed and dropped her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be your wife. I\u2019ll be Lady Aldridge.\u201d</p><p>Good God. She was serious. She expected him to postpone their honeymoon and run for Parliament in a few weeks. Toby, on the other hand, had no wish to run for Parliament in a few weeks. Nor in a few years, for that matter. Not when he\u2019d successfully invested a decade in avoiding that very task.</p><p>\u201cDarling, there\u2019s no need to be in a hurry. Governments come and go. Our wedding will only happen once. Let\u2019s enjoy our honeymoon, and then I can run for Parliament the next time there\u2019s an election called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that will be years from now.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, precisely.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou\u2019ve been ill. You need rest, not the strain of a political campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the prospect of the campaign is what\u2019s made me feel better! As soon as I saw the paper, I knew I must resolve to recover my strength. You will need me, to stand by you and work with you. Oh, Toby,\u201d she said, her dark eyes shining. \u201cThink of all the good we will do together.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed and looked back at the newspaper. So this was what had prompted her swift recovery, her determination to regain her health and marry him as planned\u2014the prospect of an election. Not the prospect of being with him. A bitter taste filled his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Isabel, but I just don\u2019t think this is the time.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew sharp. \u201cWhat do you mean? I thought you understood when we became engaged, that I sought a match for political and social influence. You told me you would be serving in the House of Commons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She mimicked his baritone. \u201c\u2018Even I could have a seat in Commons, lowly sir that I am.\u2019 Those were your words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d She looked near tears.</p><p>He touched her cheek. \u201cBut I thought... there is something between us now. Something real and undeniable, and stronger than any words carelessly uttered on a verandah.\u201d He leaned forward to kiss her.</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cDesire, you mean?\u201d</p><p>Desire? Toby schooled his expression, trying not to look wounded. Certainly, there was desire</p><p>\u2014on his side, there was a prodigious amount of desire. But during that kiss just now ... he\u2019d fancied there was some deeper emotion beneath it.</p><p>Evidently, the fancies were all on his side.</p><p>She shook her head, casting her eyes to her lap. \u201cOther people may marry for desire, but I cannot. Have I not made it clear from our first meeting, I intend to marry for influence and the opportunity to do good? If you will not offer me that, then perhaps\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He put a finger on her lips, shushing her. Dear Lord, the girl was a breath away from crying off. Desperation welled in his gut. This could not happen again. First Sophia had jilted him; now Isabel threatened to do the same. Was there no lady in England who could see her way clear to actually marry him as promised?</p><p>Toby gathered what pride remained to him. Perhaps he could talk her out of this madness.</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean to say is, it won\u2019t work. Unless you mean for me to purchase a rotten borough</p><p>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Her eyes widened in horror at the suggestion of corruption. Just as he\u2019d known they would.</p><p>\u201cThen I should have to run against Mr. Yorke, you see. He\u2019s served our borough faithfully for years, and what\u2019s more, he\u2019s an old friend. He\u2019s also very popular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopular? But your mother loathes him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is a special case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe anyone could be more popular than you. You\u2019re the most popular gentleman in Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Town, perhaps I am. But these aren\u2019t society matrons, Isabel, they\u2019re farmers. Mr. Yorke understands their needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will you, once you have an opportunity to listen.\u201d</p><p>Dear, ridiculous girl, staring up at him with such expectation in her eyes. He pulled back, startled. No, this was more than expectation. Her eyes held the glimmer of faith. Wholly unearned and completely misapplied, but faith it was. By some miracle, she believed in him. What a novel sensation. He found himself quite rapidly drunk on it.</p><p>\u201cYou will win their loyalty,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m certain I know of no gentleman more persuasive. For heaven\u2019s sake, you just convinced me to eat an ice. Not to mention, to ...\u201d Her pale cheeks flushed with embarrassment. \u201cAt any rate, you\u2019re very persuasive.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him so sweetly, he almost wanted to believe her. As if farmers would respond to the same charm as debutantes. They\u2019d be mad to vote for Toby over Yorke, even if Toby paid out handsome bribes\u2014which Isabel would never allow him to do. This half-witted MP election scheme would be certain to fail.</p><p>But then\u2014perhaps that made it perfect.</p><p>Even if he agreed to run, he would most assuredly lose. Isabel would have to give him credit for trying, the sweet girl that she was, and Toby would never have to serve in Commons. By the time the next election rolled around, she\u2019d be occupied with her charities and\u2014God willing</p><p>\u2014a child or two, and she\u2019d forget all about this Parliament foolishness. He just had to get her to the altar first.</p><p>Promise her anything. Keep her happy. Make her smile.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Her face lit up. Oh, that look was worth anything.</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019ll run for MP?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll run,\u201d he told her, basking in her palpable excitement. \u201cMind, I can\u2019t guarantee that I\u2019ll</p><p>win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you will. I have complete faith in you.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Isabel. But for how long?</p><p>Toby bent his head to steal one last kiss\u2014and found himself being plundered. Within seconds, Isabel was half in his lap, tentatively exploring his mouth with her tongue. Perhaps there was nothing behind her kiss but desire and a glimmer of misplaced faith\u2014but Toby couldn\u2019t bring himself to complain. Right now, this felt like more than enough.</p><p>And though their wedding was still almost two weeks distant, he made a vow to himself, there and then. Whatever it took\u2014funds, misdirection, outright deceit\u2014he would find a way to make this last.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you wait a few minutes longer?\u201d Toby asked, as the orchestra struck the final chord and they whirled to a halt. \u201cI was hoping we could go speak with your brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, it\u2019s my ...\u201d Isabel gave him a pained look, then stood on her toes to whisper in his ear. The delicate warmth of her breath sent heat coursing through his veins. \u201cIt\u2019s my hem. I tripped on it during the quadrille.\u201d</p><p>Toby smiled. It was adorable, how aggrieved she became, owning up to something so meaningless as a ripped hem. But it warmed his heart that she overcame her distress and gave him the honest truth. He\u2019d heard his fill of enigmatic feminine excuses, and he certainly had no use for them in a wife.</p><p>But truly, of late he found everything about her adorable. Toby was well and thoroughly besotted with his future bride. How could he not be? He\u2019d been the recipient of admiring gazes, adoring ones\u2014he could count a half-dozen girls in this ballroom alone who\u2019d once regarded him with nigh-on-idolatrous worship in their eyes. But none of them had Isabel\u2019s principles and discernment, and none of them had ever regarded him with such faith.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf your hem is ripped, it\u2019s not noticeable in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut everyone\u2019s staring at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they are. Not only is this ball being held in your honor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, our honor\u2014but you\u2019ve committed the unforgivable sin of being the most beautiful lady in the room.\u201d He placed a hand on the small of her back. \u201cJust three minutes with your brothers, and I\u2019ll escort you to the retiring room myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just go while you speak with them? Whatever it is you want to discuss, surely you don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I\u2019d miss you.\u201d With his signature persuasive grin, he steered her toward the corner of the ballroom currently anchored by the broad-shouldered bulk of two Grayson men. Truly, he didn\u2019t need her there. But this was a complicated maneuver he\u2019d been planning for weeks, and all of it solely for Isabel\u2019s benefit. There was no way he would allow her to miss the crowning moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReginald,\u201d he called, pausing on his way toward Gray and Joss. \u201cMay I beg your company for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d With a polite bow to Isabel, his brother-in-law joined their group. \u201cWhat is it, Toby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that I told you Isabel\u2019s brother is interested in studying law, as it affects his shipping business?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you remember promising to take him as a pupil in your offices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>Toby nodded toward the corner. \u201cAllow me to introduce him, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve already met Gray,\u201d Reginald murmured, as they walked in that direction. \u201cThe other week, at Lord Fairleigh\u2019s dinner party.\u201d</p> <p>Toby\u2019s smile widened.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d he said smoothly, as they reached the Graysons. \u201cGray, I know you\u2019ve been introduced to my brother-in-law, Mr. Reginald Tolliver.\u201d</p><p>The men traded perfunctory nods.</p><p>\u201cReginald,\u201d Toby continued, \u201callow me to introduce Isabel\u2019s other brother, Captain Josiah Grayson. Joss, this is my brother-in-law, one of England\u2019s finest barristers. He\u2019s agreed to supervise your legal studies.\u201d</p><p>To his credit, Reginald refused to display the slightest hint of surprise that his new pupil was part African. After all, he hadn\u2019t become a top barrister by being easily rattled. He did, however, shoot Toby a look that told him Reginald knew he\u2019d been manipulated, he didn\u2019t appreciate it, and it would be his and Augusta\u2019s turn to summer in the Brighton cottage, two years running.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure to make your acquaintance, Captain Grayson,\u201d Reginald said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201d</p> <p>Toby moved to the side, allowing Reginald and Joss the space to discuss particulars. The step brought him closer to Gray, not entirely by accident.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gray muttered, in a tone that told Toby to expect no further comment. But really, those two words were more than enough. If all the remarks in the world were ranked according to how much pleasure Gray would take in saying them to Toby\u2014Toby suspected the list would be topped with \u201cI only wish I could kill you twice\u201d and end with something like, \u201cKiss me again.\u201d Just a rung or two above that last would be \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Toby replied in a magnanimous tone. It hardly signified that Gray had already left. His chest swelled with victory, until he damn near floated away. A tug at his sleeve yanked him back to earth.</p><p>\u201cToby?\u201d Isabel\u2019s low voice was resonant with emotion.</p><p>\u201cYes, darling?\u201d He turned to her, prepared to receive an outpouring of gratitude and affection.</p><p>\u201cMay I please go have my hem repaired now?\u201d</p><p>Toby stared at her, then gave a little laugh. He\u2019d just secured England\u2019s most unlikely aspiring lawyer the tutelage of England\u2019s most successful barrister, and Isabel\u2019s opinion of him hadn\u2019t altered one bit. She wasn\u2019t impressed, or even grateful in the least. Because she wasn\u2019t surprised. She simply expected heroics of him. He couldn\u2019t decide whether that response was mildly disappointing, or supremely satisfying in some bone-deep, essential way. One thing was certain. It was intimidating. Not to mention unsettling, the lengths to which he felt prepared to go, to win his lady\u2019s favor. He half wished some fire-breathing dragon would crash through the frescoed ceiling, just so he might have the pleasure of slaying it for her.</p><p>\u201cOff with you, then,\u201d he said, kissing her hand. \u201cBut don\u2019t be long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much time it will take,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find another partner for the next set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a ball held in honor of our engagement? No, no. Until you return, there\u2019s no other lady for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my dear Miss Grayson, surely you don\u2019t expect Toby to be faithful to you.\u201d Reclining carefully, Lady Violet shucked her slippers and propped her stockinged feet on the arm of the settee.</p><p>Hetta Osborne averted her gaze in an attempt to hide her disgust. Between the offense of Lady Violet\u2019s remark and the unsightly bunion on the woman\u2019s great toe, Hetta\u2019s fingers itched for a scalpel.</p><p>From the corner of the room, Isabel gave a huff of shock. Lady Violet flicked it away with her gilt-edged fan.</p><p>A blunt scalpel, Hetta amended.</p><p>\u201cCome now, we are all ladies here,\u201d the matron said, baring her teeth in a predatory smile. \u201cOf course we would not speak so frankly in the ballroom, but the retiring room is our feminine sanctuary. Here, we must be honest with one another. And honestly, we all know Toby to be the most incorrigible flirt.\u201d She looked around the assembled ladies. \u201cIs there any lady here who could claim she has never fallen under his spell?\u201d</p><p>Forbidden to move by the seamstress repairing her hem, Isabel craned her neck, looking from woman to woman. Sophia and Lucy\u2014and every other lady in the room\u2014developed a sudden interest in the plush blue carpet. Well, Lucy was presumably studying the carpet, if she could spy it around her enormously pregnant belly.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Hetta said clearly, and honestly. From a clinical perspective, she could observe that Sir Toby possessed fine features and the aura of good health. But she had never felt any stirrings of attraction.</p><p>Not toward him, at any rate.</p><p>Lady Violet gave a throaty laugh and massaged her bunion-afflicted foot with one hand. \u201cOf course you haven\u2019t. You don\u2019t count. Sir Toby may be a rake, but I\u2019m sure he is not the sort to dally with the help.\u201d</p><p>Before Hetta could clear the steam from her mind to fashion her own retort, Lucy jumped to her defense. As much as an enormously pregnant woman could jump.</p><p>\u201cMiss Osborne is not \u2018the help.\u2019 She is my friend, and she is here in Town as a guest of the Earl of Kendall. And at this ball, she is a guest of Her Grace, the Duchess of Aldonbury.\u201d</p><p>Lady Violet gave another dismissive flutter of her fan. \u201cCalm down, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to c\u2014\u201d Lucy began.</p><p>\u201cReally, Lucy, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Hetta said, deciding to expend her reserve of patience on Lady Violet\u2019s behalf. She was well acquainted with Lucy\u2019s explosive temper, and pregnancy had only shortened the fuse. It would not do to make a scene. \u201cI\u2019m certain her ladyship did not mean to disparage me, but rather to praise Sir Toby.\u201d In some bizarre, misbegotten way.</p><p>\u201cExactly so,\u201d Lady Violet continued. \u201cToby may not be so low as to forage through the servants\u2019 leavings\u2014\u201d</p><p>A blunt, rusted scalpel.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but he does have a healthy appetite. As all men do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is absurd,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cAll arguments of honor and fidelity aside, there is no reason a man cannot be wholly satisfied within the confines of his marriage. If he and his wife are well matched, of course.\u201d She gave Lady Violet a coy smile. \u201cWe ladies have our appetites, too.\u201d</p><p>Laughter skittered through the room.</p><p>In an obvious attempt to escape the conversation, Sophia rose from her chair and made her way to the refreshment table.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Lady Grayson, do your appetites lead you to stray?\u201d Lady Violet called after her. \u201cI would think that strapping husband of yours would have no trouble satisfying you.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for a tart, Sophia gave a little smile. \u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s eyes lit, and she clapped her hands together. \u201cSophia, you sly thing. Why didn\u2019t you say something before?\u201d</p><p>Isabel\u2019s brow wrinkled in confusion. \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what any of you are talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cReally, Sophia, you must pass along The Book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat book?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cNone. There is no book. I know nothing about any book.\u201d Sophia gave Lucy a quelling look, whispering, \u201cGray would murder me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s the best thing about our condition\u2014complete immunity from a husband\u2019s displeasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat condition? What displeasure? What book?\u201d Isabel stamped her foot. \u201cWill someone please explain to me what is going on?\u201d</p><p>Hetta took pity on her. \u201cYour sister-in-law is with child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Sophia!\u201d Isabel exclaimed. She started toward her sister, but the seamstress yanked her to a halt. \u201cHow wonderful! But what does that have to do with a book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Sophia replied.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d Lucy said smugly.</p><p>Now Hetta was beginning to feel left out. \u201cWhy have I never seen this book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I gave it to Sophia before I even arrived at Corbinsdale,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cAnd now she seems to be hoarding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no book,\u201d Sophia ground out, tilting her chin toward Isabel. Isabel whimpered, \u201cI\u2019m so confused.\u201d The maid released her hem, and she strode over to join the group. \u201cBut on one point I am certain, Lady Violet. No matter how infamous Toby\u2019s reputation, I know him to be a most decent and generous man. Why, just today, he has arranged for my brother to study law under his sister\u2019s husband, Mr. Tolliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray wants to study law?\u201d Lucy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not Gray. Joss.\u201d</p><p>The name gave Hetta a start, and she coughed into her lemonade.</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Sophia asked. \u201cAnd Toby arranged it? Well, that is something indeed. Gray\u2019s been making inquiries for weeks, with no success. Toby\u2019s efforts are a great compliment to you, Bel. There is no love lost between him and your brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Lady Violet\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cHe is devoted to securing her favor now. But men behave quite differently as suitors than they do as husbands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my brothers,\u201d Isabel protested. \u201cBoth were great favorites with the ladies in their bachelorhood, but I know Gray is devoted to Sophia, and Joss is still\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hetta rose from her seat and shook out her skirts. \u201cMiss Grayson, perhaps you should listen to Lady Violet\u2019s well-intentioned advice on the inconstancy of husbands. I am certain she speaks from her own experience.\u201d</p><p>With that, she quit the room. She could not bear to remain a moment longer. Perhaps she had an aversion to gossip. Or perhaps she simply did not want to hear the truth. Familiar as she was with the character of long-suffering widowers\u2014most notably, her father\u2014she was in no humor to hear Isabel extol the depths of Joss Grayson\u2019s devotion to his late wife. But now that she\u2019d escaped, where to go?</p><p>Even dressed in one of Lucy\u2019s gowns, Hetta stood out at this gathering like a tin kettle amongst porcelain. Well before Lady Violet\u2019s comments, she\u2019d been deeply conscious that her mannerisms, her accent, and her bearing all declared \u201cinterloper.\u201d She would not have come at all, if Lucy had not insisted. To refuse would have been rude. There had been the pull of curiosity, too\u2014it was entirely probable that this would be her one and only opportunity to attend a ball with society\u2019s elite.</p><p>Oh, feathers. Hetta blew out a breath, annoyed with her own prevarication. What did she care about manners or high society?</p><p>There was only one true reason she\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cAre you hiding, Miss Osborne?\u201d</p><p>Hetta startled, nearly colliding with a potted tree. \u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019m not...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off as she turned to face the man behind her. Of course, she\u2019d known it must be him. She\u2019d recognized the deep timbre of his voice immediately, but she somehow hadn\u2019t quite believed he was there until she spun around and came nose-to-button with his goldthreaded waistcoat. Hiking her chin, she prodded her gaze up to his sardonic dark-brown eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding, Captain Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he replied. \u201cI only ask, because it seems an odd vantage from which to view a ball\u2014</p><p>through this barrier of foliage. Hardly the place for a young lady to stand, should she wish invitations to dance.\u201d</p> <p>The nerve of the man. As if she would receive any invitations to dance. Still, she couldn\u2019t allow him to fluster her. Hetta was not a woman who became flustered. But then, she was not a woman who hid behind potted trees, either. Drat.</p><p>\u201cI was not hiding,\u201d she repeated evenly, determined to give as good as she received. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it seems an odd place, here behind the shrubbery, for a gentleman to troll for a dancing partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d His lips quirked at the corner. It wasn\u2019t a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve found one, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>Her heart fluttered in her chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t I mean?\u201d</p><p>Curse the man. He knew. He knew she\u2019d developed this embarrassing, girlish infatuation with him, and now he was teasing her about it, right here in front of everyone. Or rather, right here behind a potted tree. And now she knew she would blush\u2014she was fair-skinned and freckled, after all\u2014and that would make everything even worse. Oh, Lord. She was already lurking in the greenery. Where did she run and hide from here?</p><p>His hand captured hers. Neither of them wore gloves. His skin was smooth and warm\u2014which made her immediately conscious that her own hand must be cold.</p><p>\u201cCome dance with me, Miss Osborne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Because she was out of place in this elegance. Because she barely knew how. Because she found it annoyingly hard to breathe in his presence. For a hundred different reasons, all of which swarmed in her stomach like wasps, and none of which she dared let escape. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He stared out over the ballroom. \u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>What sort of remark was that? Was he agreeing with her? Arguing with her? Dismissing her?</p><p>Hetta waited for some further, less cryptic response. None came.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for dancing this evening,\u201d she said casually, trying to sound as though she turned down offers of this sort every day. There, that ought to put paid to the discussion. Still, he did not acknowledge her with a reply. Her hand remained in his, however. It warmed, began to grow comfortable there. Traitorous appendage.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI shan\u2019t require you to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her onto the dance floor and within moments had her trapped in his embrace. There was no way to escape without creating a scene. And before Hetta knew it, she was dancing. She, Hetta Osborne, freckled, plain physician\u2019s daughter with little romantic inclination and even less grace, was circling a ballroom in the arms of a tall, handsome gentleman. He led with such agile command, she forgot that she scarcely knew the steps. She almost forgot that she had feet. She floated in his arms, and her wits lay scattered behind her on the waxed parquet. Hetta was breathless.</p> <p>Unfortunate, then, that her partner wished to converse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to take up legal studies soon,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Sir Toby\u2019s brother-in-law, Mr. Reginald Tolliver. It was just decided this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d He frowned at her, then made a gruff sound of annoyance. \u201cI should have known. Nothing surprises the unflappable Miss Osborne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you wish me to be surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d A few measures passed before he continued, \u201cHave you no reaction to the idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat reaction should I have?\u201d If he would tell her, she would attempt to oblige. If he would put a bit more space between them, she might be able to devise replies of her own.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Beneath her hand, his shoulder tensed. The slight flex of his muscle sent a dangerous thrill through her. \u201cI thought you would be interested. You\u2019re determined to take up medicine, although its practice is barred to you. I am determined to study law, although its practice is barred to me. We have something in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do?\u201d Hetta tripped slightly as they whirled past the orchestra. She tried\u2014desperately\u2014not to ascribe any deeper meaning to his remark. She struggled mightily against any stirrings of hope. She failed. \u201cAnd you wish to explore our common interests?\u201d It was the closest to flirting she\u2019d ever come.</p><p>\u201cThat is the simplest method of beginning conversation, is it not? To remark on common interests?\u201d</p><p>Of course. He didn\u2019t mean a thing by it. Most definitely, he didn\u2019t mean to impress her. Why would he care what she thought of him?</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to care what anyone thought of him, and that was what made him so attractive. During Isabel\u2019s illness, Hetta had spoken with the man daily and observed him in the company of others. Unlike his rakish half-brother, Joss Grayson wasted no effort on charm and made only passing attempts at civility. He did not disguise the general contempt with which he regarded the world, nor did he hide the constant pain in his eyes. She\u2019d never met anyone like him. The man was one giant, angry, suppurating wound, and he didn\u2019t care who saw it. Wounds like that were difficult for most people to look upon. Most people would rather turn away, and Captain Grayson knew it.</p><p>But Hetta was not most people. She was a physician, and inured to the sight of blood and the marks of human suffering. She didn\u2019t find him difficult to look upon. To the contrary, she found herself hard pressed to look away. He wasn\u2019t simply handsome; he was defiantly so. His jaw was permanently set, teeth gritted on some imaginary leather strop\u2014as though he were steeling himself for an incision. And his eyes fascinated her. They were the rich brown shade of mahogany, and twice as hard.</p><p>Drat. She was staring at him again.</p><p>Was it her turn to speak? She cleared her throat. \u201cSo, you asked me to dance so we could talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Had I merely wished to converse with you, I might have invented any of a dozen excuses. But dancing affords me the excuse to touch you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers fanned over the small of her back, gathering her closer to him. Hetta gasped. He noted it. \u201cYou see? A little noise like that is most gratifying. Next, I mean to make you quiver.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse thundered in her ears. He couldn\u2019t possibly intend to court her, she told herself sternly, or even to seduce her. Surely there was some mistake, some other explanation. But once again, some unreasonable wisp of hope would not be repressed. It floated blithely about her chest, evading all her attempts to squash it flat.</p><p>A strange expression overtook his face. One she\u2019d never seen him make before. It was a smile. Not just a smile, but a devastatingly handsome grin. That smile could wreak havoc in an assembly of ladies. It was a fortunate thing he saved it for rare occasions. She blurted out, \u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d Because she was dying to know, and asking seemed the most efficient way to find out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying your distress.\u201d</p><p>Not quite the answer she\u2019d been expecting. Not the answer she\u2019d been hoping to hear. Stop that. No hoping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not distressed,\u201d she lied.</p><p>And now he laughed. Laughed! It was a brittle chuckle, rusty with disuse. \u201cOh yes, you are distressed. Distressed, blushing ... dare I say, mortified? And it is most satisfying to view, after weeks of your cool competence. The unfeeling Miss Osborne proves human after all.\u201d He swept her through a turn and lowered his voice. His breath teased her ear. \u201cAllow me to give you a word of advice. It is a dangerous thing, for a woman to cultivate such an air of selfpossession. It brings out the base insecurities of men. We long to see her unnerved, made helpless, brought low. We take perverse pleasure in inciting such states.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are distressing me on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd taking amusement in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d To her dismay, she could not keep her voice from heating a degree. What a fool she\u2019d been. She actually had believed they shared something in common. That here, at last, was someone who might intuit the reason for her cool demeanor. Someone who might understand that Hetta had to work ten times as hard as any other physician for each scrap of respect she might gather, and that she didn\u2019t dare compromise that hard-won reputation for anything so pejoratively feminine as emotional display.</p><p>If she could look straight through his hardened, bitter exterior without flinching ... she\u2019d fancied he might see through hers, too, and glimpse the woman\u2019s heart within. But no. He saw nothing. He called her \u201ccold\u201d and \u201cunfeeling.\u201d Well, for a cold, unfeeling stone of a heart, hers was doing a credible impression of breaking.</p><p>Oh, Hetta. This is your own fault. You\u2019re an intelligent woman. You should have known better than to dream.</p><p>\u201cDo you ...\u201d She swallowed. \u201cDo you despise me, then?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back and regarded her with those hard, dark eyes. \u201cA little. Or perhaps I merely envy you and despise myself for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKindly release me.\u201d She squirmed in his embrace. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to dance any more.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his arm around her waist, forbidding her to leave. \u201cCome now, Miss Osborne. We\u2019re having a grand time, indeed. Don\u2019t you delight in being shocking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed? Everyone is watching us.\u201d</p><p>She had not noticed. She\u2019d been entirely focused on him. But now that Hetta surreptitiously viewed the room, she realized how many eyes tracked their progress around the dance floor. He said dryly, \u201cWe must make quite the striking couple.\u201d</p><p>Hetta contemplated striking him.</p><p>\u201cBut then,\u201d he added smoothly, \u201cI\u2019m accustomed to being the object of curiosity. People stare at me a great deal.\u201d He gave her a pointed look, steering her toward an empty corner of the ballroom. \u201cYou stare at me a great deal, Miss Osborne. Why is that? Am I an object of curiosity to you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, why did the worst five minutes of her year have to happen all in a row? Hetta planted her feet. He would not dance her a single step further. \u201cWhy are you doing this? What have I done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve unsettled me,\u201d he said, gripping her wrist until it hurt, \u201cand I thought to repay the favor. So tell me, how do you enjoy being made a public spectacle? How does it feel, to know you\u2019ll be the talk of the ladies\u2019 retiring room\u2014the milk-and-roses English miss, dancing in the arms of the bastard half-breed?\u201d</p><p>What? As if a woman like Lady Violet would care what sort of gentleman Hetta danced with. As if Hetta would care, should Lady Violet deign to object.</p><p>\u201cIf I am unsettled,\u201d she whispered hotly, wresting her arm from his grip, \u201cit has nothing to do with the censure of others, and everything to do with my own sad error in judgment. I am not some \u2018milk-and-roses miss,\u2019 Captain Grayson. I am a woman, with a name and an education and a profession, and even after this humiliating evening, I still lay claim to a shred of dignity. And as for you ... I had thought you were a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>A strange emotion flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Hetta didn\u2019t stay long enough to decipher it. She backed away, desperate to flee. The potted trees were no longer an option, but surely somewhere there was a secluded alcove or insectplagued balcony where she could fall to pieces in private.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she told him, stumbling away. \u201cFor showing me the bastard you truly are.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Isabel hadn\u2019t meant to go looking for The Book.</p><p>Really, she hadn\u2019t. She came across it almost entirely by accident. Sophia and Gray were out that evening, attending yet another ball. Bel had stayed home, presumably to rest\u2014but she found herself unable to sleep. The closer her wedding day approached, the more her sense of nervous excitement grew. Ridiculous, really. Weddings were meant to be solemn, quiet affairs between a man, his bride, and their God. The pomp and extravagant display that would accompany the ceremony were for the benefit of drawing public notice, not to swell Bel\u2019s own vanity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still, when she laid her head on the pillow at night and closed her eyes, she could not stop her imagination from tracing the pearl-seeded trim of her gown, the Belgian lace flounce that would lap at her silk slippers, the posy of hot house blooms she would carry ... Fourteen orange blossoms!</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t sleep at all.</p><p>Reluctant to rouse the maid at this late hour, Bel rose from her bed and crept to Sophia\u2019s bedchamber. She knew her sister-in-law had been having similar problems finding sleep, in these early months of her pregnancy, and Miss Osborne had given her some sort of sleeping draught. Although Sophia\u2019s insomnia was due to the aftereffects of marriage, not the anticipation thereof, Bel reasoned the draught might be of aid to her as well. By the light of a single taper, she cautiously searched the drawers of Sophia\u2019s vanity. Finding nothing but earbobs and hairbrushes, she moved to the small bedside table. The drawer slid open noiselessly, revealing the corked blue bottle of sleeping draught and\u2014</p> <p>And a book.</p><p>The Book.</p><p>This must be The Book, the subject of Lucy\u2019s insistent hinting and Sophia\u2019s equally insistent denial.</p><p>Tilting the leather binding until the embossed letters caught the candlelight, she read the title in a whisper. \u201cThe Memoirs of a Wanton Dairymaid.\u201d</p><p>Oh my.</p> <p>Bel recognized that this moment was one of those little tests life presented, from time to time. She held The Book in her hand, and now she must decide what to do with it. The right thing to do with it, she suspected, would be to put it back in the drawer, take the sleeping draught, and return to her bedchamber immediately.</p><p>But then, here was one of those little ironies life presented, from time to time. Knowing the right thing to do was far simpler in daylight, with people looking on and all potential regrets fully illuminated. When one was alone at midnight in a candlelit bedchamber, and any future beyond the present moment was as vague as the shadows ... discerning the right course\u2014or, more to the point, following it\u2014was considerably more difficult.</p><p>A very large, very curious part of her wanted to open the book. And that was what she did. It began innocently enough. There was a printed text, and then there were pen-and-ink illustrations, which looked to have been inserted after the printing. In parallel, both words and images told the story of a courtship between a dairymaid and her gentleman employer. The dairymaid possessed a buxom, rounded figure, which immediately endeared her to Bel. And perhaps she imagined it, but the gentleman suitor bore a passing resemblance to Toby\u2014lean, dashing, classically handsome.</p><p>Feeling reassured, Bel fixed her taper in a candlestick and settled herself on the edge of the bed to continue reading.</p><p>The beginnings of the lovers\u2019 assignations were almost sweet, she thought, despite her general disinclination to romance. A kiss on the hand here, a whispered endearment there ... She lingered over one depiction of the couple in a lovely pastoral scene, with rolling countryside in the background and gauzy clouds overhead. Those deft, light strokes, the attention to detail\u2014it was the oddest thing, but Bel felt that the style of illustration was somehow familiar to her. Feeling certain that a proposal of marriage would be imminent, Bel eagerly flipped another page</p><p>\u2014and nearly dropped the book.</p> <p>The dairymaid\u2019s sweet, meandering romance had taken an abrupt, quite carnal turn down the road to ruin. There she was in the dairy, reclined against the tiled countertop, hiking her skirts to her knees while the gentleman reached for her bared breast. Bel quickly scanned the preceding pages. No, no proposal of marriage therein. She felt more than a bit disappointed in the moral character of this dairymaid, with whom she\u2019d come to identify. But then, considering the word \u201cwanton\u201d in the title, perhaps she ought to have been forewarned. Even the gentleman looked different in this illustration\u2014less refined, more dark and devious. Still, she turned the page with great curiosity. Not curiosity of a prurient nature, of course. This was purely academic interest. Gentleman\u2019s hand on lady\u2019s breast\u2014this much Bel had experienced. But she was to be married in less than a week, and everything that filled the pages beyond could prove invaluable education.</p><p>Lady Violet\u2019s remarks still haunted her. Toby had such a rakish reputation. Surely he was experienced in what God intended to be the marital act, even though he had not been married. She was keenly afraid of disappointing him in her ignorance and ineptitude. She was even more afraid he might turn to another\u2014adultery being a sin even greater than fornication\u2014</p><p>should her efforts fail to please.</p><p>That was it. She was reading the rest of The Book for the good of Toby\u2019s soul. Certainly not to slake her own depraved curiosity.</p><p>With fumbling fingers, she leafed through the next several printed pages, barely skimming the text. A strange rustling sound gave her a start\u2014until she realized it to be her own raw-edged breath. Finally she came to the next illustration.</p><p>What an education it was. There were all sorts of body parts on display\u2014male, female\u2014but they remained fortunate blurs in Bel\u2019s peripheral vision as her gaze trained in on the gentleman\u2019s face. She realized, for the first time in several chapters, the illustration offered a full view of the hero\u2019s face. A face that had altered, since the first pages of the book. It now looked a great deal like her brother\u2019s.</p><p>Oh dear sweet heaven. It was. It was Gray\u2019s face. And these illustrations were Sophia\u2019s artistic hand at work\u2014that was why the style had struck Bel as so familiar.</p><p>With a cry of horror, she clapped the book shut and flung it back in the drawer. She rose from the bed, rubbing her hands briskly up and down her arms. Never mind the hour-long soak she\u2019d taken earlier that evening\u2014Bel felt unclean. And well she should, for spying through her sister\u2019s personal belongings. She ought to have known it was the wrong thing to do. No wonder Sophia had resisted all of Lucy\u2019s hints that she should pass along The Book. How could she, after filling it with illustrations of such ... such a private nature?</p> <p>Well, if Bel had been after an education, she\u2019d certainly learned her lesson. She made up her mind then and there that all further instruction in marital relations would come from her husband, and her husband alone. She did not need That Book, nor anything like it.</p><p>\u201cAppalling,\u201d she muttered, referring to her own behavior. With a resolute shove, she slammed the table drawer shut.</p><p>A moment later, she opened it again.</p><p>She might not need That Book, but one thing was clear. She now had desperate need of that sleeping draught.</p><p>A quarter-hour before his wedding was scheduled to begin, Toby stood in the annex of St. George\u2019s of Hanover, wearing a new tailcoat of close-cut superfine and a wide, idiotic grin. Hundreds of guests representing the first skim of the cream of English society crammed the church pews, all waiting to see the infamous bachelor at long last take a wife. And they would not be disappointed. They would be treated to a spectacle of blossoms and lace and seed pearls the likes of which London had never seen, and a wedding breakfast so richly spiced they\u2019d be tasting it for weeks. And at the center of it all would sparkle an unparalleled, legendary beauty: Isabel.</p><p>His Isabel.</p><p>Toby smoothed his coat sleeve. He was determined to present a relaxed exterior, but inwardly he hummed with anticipation. This morning, he claimed a public victory. Tonight, in private, he claimed his prize. Barring a last-moment crisis, this was going to be a good day. When Gray entered the room and shot him an angry glare, Toby\u2019s grin only widened. Gray\u2019s presence meant Isabel had arrived at the church; the rage in his eyes meant the wedding was still on.</p><p>It was going to be a very good day.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to do this,\u201d Gray said, prowling the small room. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to hand my sister over to you.\u201d</p><p>Toby watched him with satisfaction. \u201cI thought agitated pacing was the groom\u2019s duty. Come on, Gray. It\u2019s not so bad as all that. You make it sound as though you\u2019re leading her to the guillotine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your head I\u2019d have on a platter.\u201d Gray stopped circling the room and drilled him with a threatening look. \u201cI told you months ago\u2014keep her happy, or there will be no wedding.\u201d</p><p>The bottom dropped out of Toby\u2019s stomach. \u201cIs Isabel not happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s not happy. She\u2019s goddamned ecstatic, and I hate you for it.\u201d</p><p>Toby covered his sigh of relief with a laugh.</p><p>Gray continued, \u201cAfter today, I\u2019ve no threat to hold over your head. Well, I suppose I could always kill you.\u201d He said this with an insulting, nonchalant wave of his hand that suggested dispatching Toby would cost him all the effort of swatting a gnat. \u201cBut I\u2019m not eager to make my sister a widow at the tender age of twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... Thank you? I guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I\u2019m serious. After today, I can\u2019t order you to keep her happy.\u201d Gray approached him. \u201cSo I\u2019m not threatening you anymore, I\u2019m ... Bloody hell, I\u2019m begging you. This is my baby sister. My only sister. And this morning, she\u2019s happier than I\u2019ve ever seen her in her life.\u201d He jabbed a finger in Toby\u2019s chest. \u201cDon\u2019t cock it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, man. I think you\u2019re going to cry.\u201d</p><p>Gray bristled. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, I swear it. Your eyes are all glittery.\u201d Toby raised a finger to the corner of his own eye. \u201cLook, right here ... a little tear just about to fall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d Gray turned on his heel, making a show of raking his hand through his hair before surreptitiously swiping at his eyes.</p><p>Toby felt a pang of sympathy for the man. Perhaps it was poor form to gloat, when he\u2019d already won the battle. \u201cListen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to worry about. No one wants to see Isabel happy more than I do.\u201d</p><p>Gray threw him a look of utter skepticism.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it,\u201d Toby said slowly, just as surprised as anyone to realize he was speaking the truth. \u201cI know you can\u2019t credit it. She\u2019s been your sister all your life, and here she\u2019s been my intended just a matter of months. I don\u2019t expect you to believe me, but I tell you quite honestly, there\u2019s nothing more important to me than seeing Isabel happy. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>Gray made a sound of derision.</p><p>For both their sakes, Toby decided to lighten the mood. \u201cLook at it this way. You\u2019re not losing a sister, you\u2019re gaining a brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Now I really will weep.\u201d Collecting himself, Gray gave Toby a superior smirk. \u201cWell, I\u2019d best be getting back to Sophia. You know, my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. That won\u2019t work anymore, either. I\u2019m not envious of you. How could I be, seeing how it all turned out?\u201d For the second time in the space of a minute, Toby\u2019s impulsive honesty came as a revelation. It was true. What ever his mixed feelings toward Gray, jealousy no longer had any part in them. \u201cMind, I still think Sophia\u2019s too good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she is. I\u2019m no fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know we can agree Isabel\u2019s simply too good for this world.\u201d Toby smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for it, Gray. I think we\u2019ll just have to get along.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s shoulders scrunched together, as if the idea sent chills down his spine.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Toby prodded, enjoying the moment thoroughly. \u201cI\u2019m an amiable sort. I\u2019m friends with everyone.\u201d He opened his arms and tilted his head to the side. \u201cBrotherly hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake. I\u2019d sooner cut off my own bollocks.\u201d Gray made for the exit, leaving Toby\u2019s arms suspended mid-air. He paused at the door just long enough to repeat those encouraging words: \u201cDon\u2019t cock it up.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t cock it up, indeed. What an enlightening chat. All this time, Toby had focused on getting even with Gray\u2014only to find they\u2019d emerged as allies. At some point in their betrothal, somewhere in the midst of begging, charming, cajoling, and outright lying to earn her approval </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2014Isabel had crawled straight into his breast pocket and made a home there. To be honest, it could also have had something to do with the point when his fingers crawled into her bodice ...</p><p>At any rate, the game had changed. He didn\u2019t want to get even with Gray anymore, or assuage his own wounded pride. He\u2019d grown accustomed to Isabel\u2019s lovely smiles and expressions of kindhearted delight. He\u2019d come to live off her sweet faith, the perfect trust in her eyes when she gazed at him. Now he couldn\u2019t imagine surviving without it\u2014any more than he could imagine surviving without air, or food. Whether her brother believed it or not, Toby truly wanted, more than anything, to keep his wife happy.</p><p>Which meant keeping his promises.</p> <p>Good Lord.</p><p>All his promises. Every blasted one of them.</p><p>The door burst open again. Toby looked up, expecting to see Jeremy, prepared to assume his role of best man. Instead, in walked a much older friend\u2014in more ways than one.</p><p>\u201cMr. Yorke,\u201d Toby greeted him. \u201cWhat a pleasant surprise. Come to give me last-minute advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s this for advice? Run away. You\u2019re making a terrible mistake. Marriage is for virgins and fools.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd here you\u2019ve remained a bachelor all these years.\u201d Toby chuckled. \u201cAstonishing.\u201d</p><p>The old man released a heavy sigh. \u201cDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to dissuade you. Thought it was worth a try, though\u2014just to witness the fit that woman would have when her son\u2019s wedding fell through for the second time.\u201d Mr. Yorke withdrew a flask from his breast pocket. \u201cSince you\u2019re determined to go through with it, perhaps you need some encouragement of the liquid variety?\u201d</p><p>Toby reached for the flask gratefully. \u201cActually, I believe I do.\u201d He leaned against the stone window ledge and motioned for Yorke to join him. \u201cYou do realize, it\u2019s been a good fifteen years since she took me to task for drinking. I hope you\u2019re not expecting to ruffle her feathers with this.\u201d He tossed back a mouthful of liquor.</p><p>\u201cI only wish. Speaking of that woman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, \u2018that woman\u2019 happens to be my mother. Not to mention, a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman has just related to me another of her pernicious lies. She says you mean to stand up against me in the election. You mean to contest my seat in Parliament, she says! I know it has to be a falsehood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d Toby hedged. Here was one of those promises, come back to haunt him. \u201cIt\u2019s true, I had been planning to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know how I know it\u2019s a falsehood? Aside from the fact that you\u2019d have no hope of winning, of course.\u201d Yorke took back his flask and downed a swallow. \u201cThat woman tells me you\u2019re running as a Whig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman speaks the truth, I\u2019m afraid. But I can explain. You see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d Yorke drained the brandy and sent the flask clattering to the floor. \u201cHonestly. As a Whig, Toby?\u201d He might as well have recited, \u201cEt tu, Brute?\u201d \u201cHave I taught you nothing? It would be one thing if you wanted to take up politics on the proper side. I\u2019d take you under my wing, find a borough for you. Hell, I\u2019d nominate you myself. But after all these years\u2014all those times I let you sleep off mischief in my hayloft, poach grouse from my woods\u2014this is how you repay me? By turning Whig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s a tragedy. I\u2019ll have to start frequenting Brooks\u2019.\u201d Toby put a hand on Yorke\u2019s shoulder, taking quick stock of his friend and their lifelong acquaintance. The old man was right, Toby did owe him better than this. He owed him a great deal. He recalled many a fine afternoon spent angling for trout in the stream between their lands, and he recalled several occasions when his neighbor had fished him out of a scrape.</p><p>What he didn\u2019t recall was precisely when Yorke had become so ancient. The man\u2019s snowy hair had thinned considerably in recent years, and his once-subtle smile lines had deepened to permanent furrows.</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment to explain,\u201d Toby said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my mother\u2019s idea, it\u2019s my lovely bride\u2019s. She\u2019s a very principled girl; I don\u2019t deserve her at all. She has her heart set on seeing me in Parliament, Lord knows why. But I promised her I\u2019d run, in a moment of... weakness. Serious weakness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Yorke said meaningfully. \u201cWhile your wits had gone south on holiday?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Toby said. His wits began packing their trunks for a return visit, just at the memory. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ve explained to my bride your long history of service and unparalleled popularity with the electors. She\u2019s been well informed that I have no hope of winning, but she is determined to see me try, I\u2019m afraid. And besotted fool that I am, I\u2019ve decided to indulge her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to inconvenience me.\u201d</p><p>Toby raised his hands in an exasperated gesture. \u201cWhat can I say? She\u2019s prettier.\u201d</p><p>Yorke laughed heartily. \u201cShe\u2019s a rare beauty, is what she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she, though? And I\u2019m going to marry her in a matter of minutes. I can\u2019t go ruining it the first week, by kidnapping her to the Lake District instead of fulfilling my promise to stand up in Surrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be much of a honeymoon, would it? No, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll not put up any real opposition. After the nominations, I\u2019ll stay away from the hustings entirely. Once Isabel understands how capably you represent the borough and what faith the electors have in you, she\u2019ll recover from any disappointment. In the meantime, I\u2019ll do my best to find other methods of keeping her occupied.\u201d</p><p>Yorke gave him a merry look. \u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? There\u2019s no need for concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s concerned?\u201d The old man harrumphed. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though I\u2019ve been running unopposed all these years, you know. I know something about beating out upstart candidates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadman Montague doesn\u2019t count. Don\u2019t throw me in with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Yorke continued, undeterred, \u201cit gives me one more opportunity to thwart that woman\u2019s machinations. She\u2019ll be bitterly disappointed when you lose.\u201d</p><p>Toby smiled. \u201cIndubitably. Don\u2019t you see? I\u2019ll keep my promise to run for Parliament, you\u2019ll keep your seat. I\u2019ll make my bride happy; you\u2019ll continue making my mother miserable. It\u2019s the perfect solution, all around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long as the women don\u2019t catch on, eh?\u201d</p><p>Toby gave a self-conscious tug on his ear. It might not be an auspicious beginning to a marriage, plotting to deceive his bride just minutes before the ceremony. But once they were married, he fully intended to go about deserving Isabel\u2019s good opinion. On his own terms, by some endeavor of his own choosing. Surely he could find some way to make himself useful that did not involve sooty foundlings or arse-numbing sessions of Parliament. A method that didn\u2019t require him to publicly trounce an old, respected friend.</p><p>Chuckling, Yorke held out his hand. \u201cI do like the way you think. Very well, then. May the best man win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Toby said, shaking it.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Jeremy said, standing impatient in the doorway, \u201cthe best man is here. And he\u2019s tired of fending off anxious looks from the priest, the bride\u2019s brothers, and the mother of the groom. Can we get this thing underway?\u201d Remembering himself, he added a perfunctory bow toward the older man. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us, Mr. Yorke.\u201d</p><p>Toby stood, pulling down the front of his waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cThis is your last chance to change your mind,\u201d Yorke said. \u201cAre you certain you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Toby answered, to all the questions implied. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>At the knock on the connecting door, Bel nearly jumped out of her skin. Absurd, to be so surprised by the very event she\u2019d been standing there anticipating. Her heart slammed into her ribs, and her eyes darted wildly about the bedchamber. Should she meet him at the door? Lie down on the bed? Flee to her dressing room and hide?</p><p>And here she\u2019d thought the wedding ceremony taxing on her nerves. Parading down the aisle of St. George\u2019s under the scrutiny of hundreds? That was nothing, compared to waiting for her new husband to attend her on their wedding night. At least in church, she\u2019d known in which direction to walk.</p><p>In the end, she did what she always did when shock rendered her immobile. She stood still. The door swung open, and Toby struck a casual pose, leaning one shoulder against the doorframe. \u201cGood evening, Lady Aldridge.\u201d</p><p>He was still dressed in the same pinstriped trousers he\u2019d worn for the wedding, though his topcoat, waistcoat, and cravat had disappeared. Bel tore her gaze from the gaping collar of his shirt to focus on the one permanent fixture of his appearance: that charming, boyish grin. She attempted a smile in return, instinctively wrapping her arms about her chest and gathering the edges of her lace-trimmed dressing gown. How she envied his easy confidence in every situation. Throughout the ceremony, the wedding breakfast, their installation here at Aldridge House, and even their first dinner as husband and wife\u2014he\u2019d been the epitome of poise. Bel had remained close to his side all day, praying some of his self-assurance might rub off on her. Perhaps, she thought, the same strategy would serve her well this evening. Perhaps she did know in which direction she should walk. Really, it was the same as in church. She walked toward him.</p><p>His grin widened as she approached. She felt her own smile growing, too.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Sir Toby,\u201d she said, stopping just inches from him.</p><p>His arm snaked around her waist, and he pulled her tight for a kiss. It was the briefest, most chaste of kisses, but somehow more intimate than any kiss they\u2019d shared before. This was not a suitor\u2019s kiss, but a husband\u2019s kiss. Comfortable, authoritative ... and performed in a state of undress.</p><p>Before Bel had any chance to catch her breath, he released her waist and strolled past her into the bedchamber. Now she was the one left leaning against the doorframe for support.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you,\u201d he asked, taking up the poker and stirring the fire, \u201chow immensely proud you made me today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d she said, smiling to herself. \u201cSeveral times.\u201d In the carriage, after the ceremony. Then again, whispering in her ear during the wedding breakfast. Once more, over dinner. \u201cI begin to believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be certain to tell you several more times, so there can be no misunderstanding.\u201d He replaced the poker and met her in the center of the room, grasping her hands in his. \u201cTruly, Isabel. I\u2019m the most fortunate fellow in England. As long as I live, I\u2019ll never forget how lovely you looked this morning.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Bel wished she had his easy way with words. She wanted to compliment him, too, tell him he\u2019d made the most dashing groom imaginable. That he\u2019d stolen her breath with his radiant male beauty. That she\u2019d been aching for his kiss all day, and the slight brush of his lips against hers just now had her whole body humming with desire.</p><p>\u201cToby, I...\u201d Oh, how she cursed her clumsy tongue! \u201cI feel fortunate, too.\u201d She stared up at him, hoping her eyes conveyed the admiration her words could not.</p><p>His fingertip brushed the place between her eyebrows. \u201cAlways so serious,\u201d he teased. Smiling, he withdrew a small box. \u201cI have a wedding present for you.\u201d</p><p>Bel took the box and opened it. Cradled on a bed of blue velvet lay a magnificent pendant, set with an iridescent opal as big as her fingernail and ringed with sparkling diamonds. \u201cOh, Toby. You shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I should. I know you\u2019re not much for extravagant jewels. Little do you need them, beautiful as you are. But you are Lady Aldridge now, and if you\u2019re to be a lady of influence, you must look the part.\u201d He plucked the necklace from its box and laced the chain through his fingers. Between them, the pendant twirled, flashing in the firelight. \u201cThere are several more valuable pieces in the family, of course, and those will be yours as well. But I wanted to select something especially for you. Did I choose well?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pendant bobbed just a bit as he dangled it, and Bel caught a flash of anxiety in his eyes. Sweet man. He was genuinely worried that she might not like it. Her heart squeezed. That hint of uncertainty endeared him to her more than any gift could possibly have done. That, more than anything, showed that he cared.</p><p>\u201cYou chose perfectly. I adore it, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I put it on you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He circled behind her, undoing the clasp of the necklace with sure fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret. This is the real reason a gentleman gives his lady a necklace. For the pleasure of fastening it round her neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Bel shuddered as his fingers brushed the sensitive skin above her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cTruly. And lucky me, you\u2019ve even left your hair up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should have let the maid take it down.\u201d Bel cringed. Her maid had asked, and she hadn\u2019t known what to tell her. Her hair ... there was so much of it. It had such a habit of getting in the way.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It will be my pleasure to do so later. For now, it makes it all the easier for me to do this...\u201d The weight of the pendant settled between her breasts as he fastened the clasp. \u201cAnd this...\u201d His touch whispered up to caress the soft place beneath her ear.</p><p>\u201cAnd this ...\u201d His open mouth pressed against her nape, warm and wet, his breath rushing over her sensitized flesh.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her knees buckled, and she fell back against his chest. But he was there to support her, so tall and strong.</p><p>Light kisses feathered down the column of her neck, each one sending a current of pleasure straight to the soles of her feet. And then his tongue ... oh, his tongue climbed a path straight to her ear, and desire screamed through her. At least, Bel thought she might scream\u2014or faint, or plead, or do something else equally mortifying, like melt into a puddle at his feet. She seemed to be melting already, at the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>He drew her earlobe into his mouth and suckled it lightly. Oh. Oh. Yes, something unmistakably liquid was happening down there. Ohhh ... dear. She tensed every muscle in her body, attempting to solidify her will and her person.</p> <p>He stopped instantly. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered quickly. Too quickly to be credible.</p><p>\u201cForgive me. I\u2019m moving too fast. We have the whole night ahead of us. Perhaps you\u2019d prefer to rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I think I\u2019d rather ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave it over with?\u201d His soft laugh tickled her ear.</p><p>\u201cYes. I mean ...\u201d Bel\u2019s face burned as she realized how ungracious she sounded. \u201cThat is, unless you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>His voice went dark. \u201cOh, I want to. I very much want to.\u201d His hands slid to her hips, and for the first time Bel noticed something hard and hot pressing into her lower back. She knew it had to be his manhood. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you since the first moment I saw you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. Against her crossed arms, her nipples hardened and ached. And what was the polite response to such an admission? Thank you? Sir, you flatter me? Please be gentle, and if at all possible, quick?</p> <p>At the heart of the matter, Bel wasn\u2019t sure how to respond simply because she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about the entire enterprise. Her racing pulse, her quickened breath, the heightened awareness of all her senses\u2014her body was readying for something. She just didn\u2019t know what. Excitement and terror mingled in her veins, and she couldn\u2019t tell whether her instincts were urging her to fly at her husband or simply flee the room.</p><p>Of course, the second was not an option at all. She was married now, and conjugal relations were her wifely duty. The thought calmed her. Bel might not know what to make of this unruly sensation, but she understood duty. And she wanted to make Toby happy, she did. Closing her eyes, she resolved to focus on him\u2014on the warm, solid planes of his chest supporting her frame, his confident hands grasping her shoulders, the heat of his breath against her ear. He was her husband, and she could deny him nothing.</p><p>And just when she had decided to turn, face him, and brazenly offer herself for his pleasure, he took a step back. Suddenly cold, she hugged herself tight and shivered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take things slowly,\u201d he said, twining a finger through the loose strands of hair at her temple. \u201cMay I take your hair down?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. After pausing to take a hairbrush from the dressing table, he guided her to sit at the foot of the bed and then knelt behind her. It made Bel increasingly anxious, how much time he was spending behind her. She couldn\u2019t comfort herself by focusing on his warm eyes or his easy grin. He was all seductive touch and smooth whispers and masculine heat. She couldn\u2019t see him; she could only feel him. Hear him. Breathe the last traces of his expensive cologne as they evaporated into the natural musk of his skin.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He teased a pearl-studded pin from her hair and held it above her left shoulder. Bel held up her open palm to receive it. Soon another pin joined the first, and another and another</p><p>\u2014until her hair tumbled free down her back, the blunt ends just brushing the coverlet. She curled her fingers over the clutch of pins, unsure what to do with them.</p><p>\u201cMagnificent,\u201d he murmured, lifting her hair and allowing it to spill over her shoulders and around her breasts. \u201cLike black silk.\u201d He tugged the brush through her hair in a long, slow motion, stroking a wave of delicious pleasure from her scalp to the base of her spine. Behind her, Toby made a strange sound in his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s like pulling a brush through water. Do you know I\u2019ve dreamed of doing this?\u201d</p><p>Had he, truly? Dreamed of this? Bel had experienced some rather intimate dreams of her own the past few weeks. None of them so specific as brushing hair. No, her own dreams were restless and vague and shadowy and just never quite complete. With expert care, he worked his way through each section of her hair. A pleasant languor settled over Bel as he brushed, and the knot of tension in her belly began to uncoil. She closed her eyes, bracing her weight on her right hand and still clutching the handful of hairpins in the left.</p><p>\u201cIsabel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do understand, don\u2019t you? What occurs between a husband and wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d She winced as the brush snagged on a hidden tangle. \u201cI understand.\u201d At least, she comprehended the basic idea. Even without reading That Book, she\u2019d lived too rural a life to grow up completely innocent of mating.</p><p>\u201cDid your ...\u201d Toby cleared his throat, then continued in a tone of false nonchalance. \u201cDid your sister speak with you, tell you what to expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. That is, Sophia offered.\u201d His hand jerked slightly when she said the name. Oh, how unspeakably embarrassing this was! \u201cBut as I said, I already understood the general concept, and I told her ... I told her I would prefer to learn the rest from you.\u201d</p><p>He set the brush aside. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She craned her neck, needing to see his expression. Had she done the right thing? To her relief, he looked pleased. \u201cI trust you will explain to me anything you wish me to know. And if there are things you do not wish me to know\u2014well then, it is best they remain unexplained.\u201d</p><p>A puzzled smile appeared on his face. \u201cThank you. I think.\u201d He swept a heavy lock of hair behind her ear. Their gazes met, and she caught a peculiar glimmer in his eyes. \u201cYour trust humbles me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I find myself quite humbled by my ignorance, so perhaps we are well matched in that respect.\u201d</p><p>He moved to sit beside her at the edge of the bed, taking her open hand in his. \u201cI believe we are well matched, in many respects.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and stared down at their interlaced fingers. His thumb stroked idly back and forth across the back of her hand. So gentle, so soothing\u2014even though his uneven breath betrayed his growing passion. Truly, she had the best, most patient of husbands. How could she not give him her trust?</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d she said haltingly, \u201cit\u2019s clear you have considerable experience with ...\u201d She cast a darting glance over her shoulder, toward the vast expanse of mattress. \u201cWith this. How could I doubt your ability to guide me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsiderable experience?\u201d He laughed. \u201cAgain, I thank you. I think. Darling, my experience</p><p>\u2014while not negligible\u2014is probably less than you imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Bel paused, thinking of the scandal sheets tallying his paramours.</p><p>\u201cBut what? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve been reading The Prattler?\u201d</p><p>She slanted her gaze to the floor. \u201cNot purposely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, don\u2019t believe all you read in the newspapers.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cIsabel, I\u2019m not a monk. But though I may flirt with every debutante to flounce in my direction, when it comes to ...\u201d His eyes darted toward the bed. \u201cTo this, there haven\u2019t been so many as the papers imply. There haven\u2019t been any, actually, in some time. Do you understand what I\u2019m telling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are selective and principled?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou always give me too much credit. I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019m quite desperate for you.\u201d He let go of her hand and caressed her cheek. Then her bottom lip. The smooth charm in his voice gave way to raw need as the distance between them narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you, for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>His lips took hers in a passionate kiss. Bel\u2019s fingers curled into fists. The hairpins bit into her left palm. How absurd, that she was still holding them, but what else could she do? Should she break the kiss to say, Dear, sweet husband, I know you\u2019ve been waiting for me for a very long time, but can I beg you to wait a moment longer while I dispose of these hairpins?</p><p>No, of course not. She would not ask him to wait, not a moment longer. She would allow him to kiss her, just as deeply as he wished. And she would kiss him back, stroking his tongue with hers\u2014because he made a little growl of approval when she did so, and Bel craved his approval even more than she craved his kiss. He was proud of her, he\u2019d said. And even if he had told her so several times already, she couldn\u2019t hear it\u2014or feel it\u2014enough. His hands moved to the front of her dressing gown, untying the simple ribbon bow and drawing the two sides apart. With deft fingers, he dispatched the row of tiny buttons dividing her nightgown. One, two, three, four ... Bel lost count when his mouth broke away from hers to trail urgent kisses along her jaw and down her throat. His fingertips brushed her breastbone as he worked the buttons loose, one after another\u2014and that unbearable, heavy ache swelled her breasts.</p><p>Bel squeezed her eyes shut as he parted the sides of her nightgown, exposing her bosom. She could feel him staring at her chest, her nipples tightening under his gaze. But she would gladly forgive him a lifetime of lurid glances, if only he would touch them. And, oh. Oh, at last. He did.</p><p>Someone gave a ragged sigh. Bel wasn\u2019t sure if it had originated in his chest or hers. She opened her eyes to see his strong, sculpted hands cupping her breasts, lifting them, taking their ponderous weight from her frame. Oh, heaven. It was like bathing in the sea, buoyant and weightless. Her dark, swollen nipples jutted out for attention, and he brushed his thumbs over the straining tips. Twin jolts of pleasure raced to her core.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Bel resisted the impulse to disagree. Her breasts always looked grotesquely large and indecent to her, but in his hands they looked\u2014not beautiful, exactly. But as though they fit. As though they were just right. The heavy globes were the perfect size for his fingers to hold, to lift, to shape. Her large, dark areolas seemed expressly fashioned to wedge in the crook of his thumb and forefinger as he ever-so-gently squeezed.</p><p>Bel gasped as he bent his head and took her taut, aching nipple into his mouth. She was a perfect fit there, too. Wild sensation swirled through her as he licked and sucked. There she went, melting again. Damp heat surged between her thighs, and she clamped them together. Toby transferred his attentions to the other breast, working dark, dangerous magic with his lips and tongue. All the while, his hand groped for the hem of her nightgown. With rough movements, he gathered the fabric up to her knee, and then his hand encircled her bare thigh. The air in the room grew thin. No matter how her lungs worked, Bel couldn\u2019t draw enough of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsabel.\u201d His brow rested on her chest. \u201cLet me touch you there.\u201d</p><p>How could she refuse? It didn\u2019t seem possible to accomplish what she knew they must accomplish without some part of him touching her there. But her panic built as his hand crept slowly higher, up the sensitive slope of her inner thigh, knowing that he would most certainly discover\u2014</p><p>He groaned as his fingers reached her cleft. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet.\u201d</p> <p>To her surprise, he didn\u2019t sound appalled, but pleased. Approving. His fingers rubbed against her, and Bel gave a sharp cry. She couldn\u2019t help it. The sensation was so intense. The hairpins bit into her palm as she struggled for control.</p><p>He kissed her, stifling her next unwilling moan. \u201cI knew it would be like this,\u201d he said between kisses, his fingers rubbing her more firmly. More quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re so serious, my darling. Always so serious. But not here, not with me. Here, I knew you would be so passionate. So free.\u201d</p><p>No, no, she wanted to protest. I\u2019m a woman of faith and principle. I refuse to be ruled by my passions. That way lies madness.</p><p>But then with a single finger, he parted her folds and slipped inside her. Inside her. The feeling was ... shocking. Glorious. Incompatible with thought, much less conversation. A hot, restless longing built as he stroked her relentlessly, inside and out. The sensation was not wholly unfamiliar. Sometimes in the night Bel woke with this same dull ache between her legs. And she\u2019d learned years ago that if she rolled over and ground her hips against the bed, first it got a bit worse, but then it got a bit better\u2014until it broke into pieces and mercifully went away.</p><p>But it was never like this. Never this bad. Never this good.</p> <p>Without ceasing his sweet torment, Toby sank to the floor and knelt in front of her, spreading her legs. It seemed wrong, in so many ways: him kneeling before her, her thighs splayed in this lewd posture, the manner in which her most intimate places were revealed to his gaze, to his touch ...</p><p>To his mouth.</p><p>Oh. Oh. Oh.</p><p>Never this bad. Never this good. It was too much, too much.</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d She wriggled away from him, but his hand tightened over her thigh. \u201cToby, please. Don\u2019t you want to take your pleasure now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pleasure is my pleasure.\u201d He licked her over and over, so very lightly. And sensation detonated in her each time, destroying her presence of mind. She understood why her mother had gone mad from passion. With each tender caress, he pushed her closer to some terrible brink of sanity. She would shatter apart. She would never be whole again.</p> <p>\u201cToby, please.\u201d She forced the words out. \u201cYou must ... must stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat must I stop?\u201d he asked, his voice joking. \u201cThis?\u201d He licked. \u201cThis?\u201d He stroked. \u201cOr this?\u201d He pursed his lips and did something ineffably wicked.</p><p>Another little cry escaped her. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Because I know how you love it.\u201d</p><p>She did. She did love it. In this insane moment she nearly believed she loved him for it. Because she trusted him so completely. She knew that when he teased her, it meant she was strong enough to bear it.</p><p>Proving the point, he took pity on her unease, kissing his way back up her belly. His hand resumed stroking her, inside and out, as he fastened his lips around her nipple. Pleasure built, rolling through her body, making her quiver and writhe helplessly. Bel tensed again. She didn\u2019t like feeling helpless. This all felt so wrong. She\u2019d been fully prepared for Toby to take pleasure from her, but she didn\u2019t know how to handle receiving it from him.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d he murmured, kissing his way from one breast to the other. \u201cDon\u2019t fight it. You\u2019ll make it better for me, if you just let go.\u201d</p><p>Let go. You\u2019ll make it better for me. His words freed her. She could do this\u2014even this\u2014for him. With a rough gasp, she bucked against his hand.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he sighed, stroking her faster. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>She clutched his shoulder with her right hand, and her left unfurled. The hairpins fell to the floor in a cascade of metallic pings. His hand and lips made wet sounds of suction as they worked her moist flesh. But the crashing roar of her pulse overpowered all; the pleasure overtook all.</p><p>And she let go.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Toby held her tight.</p><p>In all his life, he thought he would never hear a sound more arousing than Isabel\u2019s hoarse cry of passion. As her climax subsided she slumped against him, spent and breathless. Her intimate muscles were still clenching around his sheathed finger, but Toby\u2019s restraint had reached its limit.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said, withdrawing his hand and lifting her onto the bed. \u201cBut I must have you. And it must be now.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a groggy nod and a murmured, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Toby scrambled to unbutton his fall before his erection burst right through his trousers. God, he was still almost fully clothed. But then, so was she\u2014and he had no intention of slowing down for even the few seconds it would take to rectify the situation. In fact, he loved her this way. The contrast of her glossy black hair and olive skin against that virginal white lace took him from aroused to fair frenzied with desire.</p><p>He worked his trousers down over his hips and positioned himself at her entrance, gathering his control just long enough for one last murmured apology: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. The pain lasts only a moment, darling.\u201d</p><p>He eased into her, a bit. Then a bit more.</p><p>She winced. He held still, offering her body time to adjust even though every cell in his own body urged him to drive home. \u201cBetter?\u201d He grated out the word.</p><p>She gave a little nod, and he advanced again\u2014this time sheathing himself in one long, gliding thrust that seemed interminable in all the best and worst ways. When at last he was fully seated, he stretched his body over hers, guarding her between his arms. \u201cIsabel,\u201d he whispered, closing his eyes and reveling in the blissful sensation of her warm, wet body gripping him, holding him.</p><p>Her body made a home for his, her legs spreading a bit wider to cradle his hips, her soft breasts cushioning his chest. When he felt her relax, and every muscle in his own body tensed, only then did he start to thrust. Slowly, at first. As gently as he could. And then, bracing himself on his elbows, he drove a bit harder, a bit faster. Which was a mistake, because as he drove harder and faster, she began to make little sensual noises with each thrust. And those magnificent breasts began to dance to his tempo. Which aroused him further, pushed him harder and faster</p><p>\u2014until he knew he was striking a most inconsiderate pace, for a gentleman bedding his lovely, innocent virgin bride.</p><p>But damn if she didn\u2019t give everything he asked, and then more. Her body yielded to his, moved with his in ways that made his mind go blank. She felt so good. He was on the verge of abandoning gentleness in favor of brevity and making a desperate surge toward climax, when he looked down to find those solemn, dark eyes staring up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d she asked. \u201cTell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>And that was when Toby changed his mind. For this, he would take his time.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI... I want to please you.\u201d</p><p>Just the words shot a thrill down his spine. His jaw clenched. \u201cYou could touch me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes skipped over his body. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever you like.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, and stayed still.</p><p>\u201cMy chest,\u201d he said hoarsely, making the decision for her. \u201cHelp me remove my shirt.\u201d</p><p>She grasped the hem of his shirt and gathered it toward his shoulders, and together they worked his arms free before she pulled it over his head. Then, slowly, she reached for him with both hands, until her fingertips rested against his chest. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. God, yes.\u201d</p><p>Her touch feathered toward his shoulders, tentative and achingly sweet. He allowed himself to move again, just the slightest of nudges into her intimate embrace. Then her thumbs brushed his nipples, and he had to freeze again, to keep from spilling his seed that instant. That would have been a tragedy, because this was too good to rush.</p><p>Using just the pads of her fingers, she cautiously skimmed every contour of his chest, his shoulders, his upper arms. Such light caresses, so devastating in their tenderness. His every nerve, every capillary pressed to the surface of his skin, eager to meet her seeking fingertips. He felt alive, in ways he\u2019d never felt before.</p><p>Her fingers skimmed up his neck, pausing against his throbbing pulse.</p><p>\u201cKiss me there,\u201d he said, realizing too late that his tone was a bit brusque. To be ordering his wife about on their wedding night, without so much as a \u201cplease\u201d ... he\u2019d always prided himself on being a patient, solicitous lover. But Toby was several inches deep in paradise, and his hands were full of Isabel\u2019s generous curves, and charm was simply not within his grasp. She didn\u2019t seem to mind. Without so much as a blink, she craned her neck and pressed her lips to his pulse\u2014once, then again. His low moan of pleasure earned him a third.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d she asked, her breath tickling his throat.</p><p>\u201cYes. More.\u201d</p><p>She trailed light kisses over his neck and chest, and the torture of her velvet-soft lips was even more exquisite than that of her fingers. Impatient with need, his hips drove home of their own accord. Startled, Isabel fell back against the pillow, her swollen lips parted in invitation. And Toby was never one to refuse an invitation.</p><p>He kissed her hungrily as he began to thrust again, relishing the sensation of pressing himself into her two ways at once. Her lovely, fresh scent wreaked its familiar havoc on his senses, but now that hint of verbena mingled with the heady aroma of arousal\u2014his, hers. Theirs. Oh, this was good. So good. Better than he could have dreamed.</p><p>And still he wanted more.</p><p>\u201cIsabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrap your legs around my waist.\u201d She obeyed. Another terse command, another accommodating response. It drove him wild, to know that she would comply with his every wish, willingly. Even eagerly. It seemed the more curtly he spoke, the more aroused she became. Those serious eyes were now heavy-lidded, drugged with desire, and her breath was a shallow tide in her chest, lifting her bosom as it ebbed and flowed. He growled, \u201cHold tight to me now.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she loved it. She ground against him, her mounting desire evident as she laced her fingers behind his neck.</p><p>What more would she do for him, if he only asked? A thousand erotic possibilities overflowed his mind, forcing all awareness down to his groin. They would all have to wait. His body clamored for release\u2014 now. He took her hard and fast, raising up on his arms for better leverage, and she clung to him tightly. Just as he\u2019d told her to.</p><p>Rebalancing his weight, he worked one hand between them. He found that small, sensitive nub at the crest of her sex and covered it with his thumb, circling lightly. Her eyes flew open. Her neck rotated back and forth, as if she were shaking her head no.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he insisted through gritted teeth. \u201cYes. Come for me again.\u201d</p><p>And she did. Just as he\u2019d told her to. Crying out and convulsing around him in hot, satin waves, pulling him deeper. Pulling him closer.</p><p>Toby clenched his jaw tight, silencing his own passion. The only words that came to mind now were unspeakable, coarse and profane. And then there were no words at all\u2014just a harsh, primal growl of release as the pleasure ripped through him.</p><p>It had never been like this. Not ever.</p><p>He collapsed onto her, panting into her silken hair. He felt wrung out, exhausted. He felt blissful and blessed. He felt like starting from the beginning and doing it all again. And again. But most of all, he felt inexpressibly fortunate in his choice of a wife. Or more accurately, in his wife\u2019s choice of him.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, my darling.\u201d He kissed her brow, damp with perspiration. \u201cThank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She made a muffled squeak in response, and Toby realized his weight was crushing her into the mattress. God, what a boor he was. He quickly withdrew from her body and rolled aside, smoothing her hair away from her face and murmuring apologies.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t distress yourself,\u201d she said, her tone one of strained formality. \u201cI\u2019m sure there is no need for apology, or gratitude.\u201d</p><p>No need for gratitude? \u201cIsabel\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t thank me.\u201d She rose up on an elbow, pushing her nightgown back down her legs. \u201cI haven\u2019t even given you your wedding gift yet.\u201d</p><p>And she was up out of bed, before Toby could argue that she\u2019d already given him the greatest gift he could possibly imagine. While she disappeared into the adjoining room, he took the opportunity to straighten his trousers and run a hand through his hair. He sat on the edge of the bed when she emerged, her dressing gown now wrapped tightly around her body. Her hands were behind her back, and her eyes were downcast.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing,\u201d she began. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any idea what to get you. You\u2019re ... you\u2019re very difficult to shop for, you know.\u201d</p><p>Toby smiled. Her anxiety was adorable. Combined with her disheveled hair and flushed complexion\u2014the effect was utterly enchanting. She could have pulled a lump of coal from behind her back, and he would have treasured it.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a lump of coal she withdrew. It was a walking stick, topped with carved ivory and inlaid with gold leaf.</p> <p>\u201cIs it the style you wanted?\u201d she asked, holding it out to him.</p><p>\u201cYes, the very one.\u201d He took it from her hand and laid it horizontally across his palm, testing its balance. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you remembered. I thought you held walking sticks in the highest contempt.\u201d He lifted an eyebrow at her. \u201cAn embellished stick, which a perfectly healthy gentleman carries about for no other purpose than to indicate his wealth ...?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sly smile. \u201cWell, and don\u2019t forget gesturing. And rapping on doors. Truthfully, I still don\u2019t understand the idea\u2014but it was the only thing I could think of to buy you. And I must admit, it does suit you.\u201d She gave him an appraising look, and he struck a cocky, barechested pose that made her blush most satisfactorily. She asked, \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore it.\u201d He held one end out to her, as though urging her to take it. When she grasped the polished wood, however, he gave a swift tug, pulling her to him. \u201cBut I adore you more.\u201d</p><p>He meant it to be a tender kiss. A kiss of thanks and appreciation. A kiss that made no demands. But one taste of her, and his body formed quite different intentions. Within seconds, he was as hard as a walking stick. Harder.</p><p>\u201cIsabel.\u201d He nipped her ear. \u201cI want you again. Can you bear it, so soon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She pulled back and studied him, that boundless trust shining in her eyes. \u201cYou would not ask it of me, if I could not.\u201d</p><p>And right then, Toby knew. He knew he was doomed.</p><p>He could run for Parliament. He could win. He could become bloody Prime Minister and the Prince Regent\u2019s closest adviser. He could travel to Ceylon and back just to bring her a cup of tea, converting a thousand heathens along the way\u2014and he would still never live up to that look in her eyes. No man could. Someday, somehow, he would hurt her\u2014and it would mean the end of everything. Oh, she would forgive him, generous soul that she was. They would still share a cordial affection. But she would never look at him like this again, as if ... as if he deserved her faith in him. One day, they would both know he did not. But for now\u2014and for as long as he could keep it so\u2014it remained Toby\u2019s secret. He slid his hands around her waist. \u201cDarling girl. Come back to bed.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>\u201cJust a few miles more.\u201d Toby peered at the carriage window, watching the familiar landscape roll past. He turned his attention to his obviously uncomfortable wife, whose clear, honeycolored complexion was tinged with green. \u201cYou\u2019re miserable, aren\u2019t you? Too much jouncing about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying the lovely countryside. But I must admit, I\u2019m not accustomed to lengthy carriage rides.\u201d Again, she twisted her hips to find a slightly different position on the tufted seat. He winced. She must be sore. No, she was not accustomed to lengthy carriage rides, nor to lengthy nights of being ridden like a carriage horse. Not for the first time since their wedding, he felt a stab of guilt. He knew he\u2019d been using his wife as if he were a sailor on shore leave\u2014</p><p>but damned if he could help it. He wanted her, all the time. And she obliged him, whenever he asked.</p><p>Even now, the sight of those luscious breasts bouncing in time to the horses\u2019 clopping hooves</p> <p>He said casually, \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d feel the ruts less if you came over here and sat in my lap.\u201d</p><p>She gave him that typically Isabel look\u2014serious and searching. He could practically see the thoughts turning over in her mind. Could her husband possibly be so wicked, she was wondering, as to suggest what her recently expanded imagination supposed?</p><p>No, she decided mutely\u2014and incorrectly\u2014with a little shake of her head. \u201cIt is kind of you to offer, I\u2019m sure. But I would not wish to wrinkle you.\u201d</p><p>Just like her, to give him far more credit than his due. If Toby had his way, her light-blue traveling habit would meet with a fate far worse than wrinkling. She had so much misplaced faith in him\u2014he only hoped a shred of it might survive his electoral defeat.</p><p>\u201cWill it be a large crowd, there at the hustings?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, undoubtedly. Hundreds, most likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I understood the number of electors to be rather small. Only those freemen who hold land, your mother told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s rather a holiday, you see. It\u2019s the spectacle that draws people from miles around, whether or not they can cast a vote. Little enough excitement to be had in a sleepy borough like ours. Any excuse for a day spent gawking and lifting pints of ale will serve. And this is just the announcement of candidacy\u2014wait until the polling begins in earnest. That\u2019s when the real debauchery starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how long will the polling last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil there is a clear winner\u2014as many as fifteen days, not counting Sundays.\u201d It wasn\u2019t likely to last five, Toby thought to himself. By all reasoning, Yorke ought to take a commanding lead from the first and end the thing swiftly.</p><p>\u201cAs many as fifteen days of drunken debauchery?\u201d Isabel\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cNo wonder people anticipate an election.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be worse. Ours is a sedate little corner of England. We could be in one of those counties up north, where the polling always ends in riots. Or worse,\u201d he added, jerking his head toward the window, \u201cjust a ways back, in Garret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat takes place in Garret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they have a sort of sham election, every Parliament. People from all around come to see it</p><p>\u2014outlandish costumes, coarse humor, barrels and barrels of ale. You see, a man needn\u2019t be a landowner to vote there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gave her a teasing grin. \u201cThere is only one qualification to vote in Garret. A man must have enjoyed a woman in the open air, somewhere within that district.\u201d</p><p>The green cast of her complexion turned to pink. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Unable to resist, Toby rose from his seat opposite and crossed the gap, settling down next to her. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he continued, leaning into her and directing her gaze out the window, \u201cI believe we may still be traveling through that district now. You did remark on the lovely countryside. And I think a breath of open air may be just the remedy you need. Shall we venture out and find an obliging little haystack or hillock to enjoy, hm?\u201d</p><p>She blushed deeper. \u201cYou are an outrageous tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not teasing at all. I\u2019d have a far better chance of winning in Garret than in my own borough. There\u2019s just that small matter of eligibility.\u201d He snaked an arm behind her waist and cupped her lush, rounded hip in his palm. With his other hand, he reached for his walking stick. \u201cI\u2019ll halt the carriage right now, if you like.\u201d He stretched his arm, extending the knob of ivory toward the coach\u2019s side, as though he would rap to signal the driver.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d Twisting her body, she stretched out a hand to stay his arm.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I would,\u201d he said, reaching out again.</p><p>\u201cToby!\u201d she exclaimed, wrestling his arm with both hands now and wriggling herself straight into his lap. Just where he\u2019d been wanting her.</p><p>He said quietly, \u201cI would.\u201d Then he paused, waiting for that beautiful face to turn toward his. \u201cI would, but only if you asked it.\u201d</p><p>Her frown melted to an inviting, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his arm, he cast aside the walking stick. He needed two hands on her delicious body</p><p>\u2014one simply wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThere now. Isn\u2019t it better, sitting like this?\u201d</p><p>She nodded breathlessly, her eyes never leaving his.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel ill anymore?\u201d</p><p>She gave a barely perceptible shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d he whispered, lowering his mouth to hers.</p><p>And when their lips met, the world stopped. God, he loved kissing her, nearly as much as he loved bedding her. Toby had never thought himself an especially fanciful fellow, but damned if there wasn\u2019t something magical in the brush of her mouth against his. Not in the sense of fairystory pixie dust or cauldrons bubbling with superstitious claptrap. Magic of the ancient, primeval sort. The unleashing of an elemental force. When they kissed, a vast realm of passion opened between them, wild and uncharted. And they explored it together, feeling their way through the dark with questing lips and seeking tongues and bold, wandering fingers. He could have held his wife in his lap and kissed her all the way to Devonshire. But as luck\u2014</p><p>and geography\u2014would have it, they reached his borough in Surrey first.</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the town?\u201d</p><p>Preoccupied with tasting every inch of her delicate throat, he spared only the briefest of glances out the window. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>With a little yelp, she squirmed out of his lap and flung herself to the opposite seat. He followed her. \u201cWe\u2019ve a few minutes yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby, no!\u201d She evaded his grasp, volleying back to her original seat. This time, he let her escape. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, darling. No one can see in. Unless they\u2019re trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they\u2019ll be trying! And look at us, all mussed and wrinkled.\u201d Her hands fluttered over her gown, and she threw him a grieved look. \u201cToby, please. Make yourself presentable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is my cravat askew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s not your cravat that\u2019s askew, it\u2019s your ...\u201d She flicked a glance at his lap. Toby looked down, then laughed. \u201cWell, my wife, unless you intend to come over here and relieve the condition\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cRight. Then the only other remedy would be time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know,\u201d she asked in a matter-of-fact tone, \u201cthat mechanical brushes can clean a flue in one-third the time of a climbing boy, and with twice the efficiency? You might mention that in your speech today.\u201d</p><p>Time, or talk of chimney sweeps.</p><p>\u201cIsabel,\u201d he said, making discreet adjustments to his fall, \u201cthese are country cottagers. They don\u2019t employ chimney sweeps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they are humans, and Christians, and must therefore respond to the plight of those pitiable children. An injustice perpetrated against the most meek of souls is an injustice against us all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Toby held his tongue. It was becoming a bit of a pattern, he\u2019d noticed. Isabel was a willing, and even enthusiastic, partner in lovemaking. But the moment their physical pleasure was concluded, her charitable zeal returned in double force. Just last night, while he\u2019d been struggling for breath in the aftermath of an explosive coupling, Isabel had popped straight from bed and fished the tinderbox and candle from the drawer of his writing desk. Her reason? It had been imperative, at two in the morning, to pen a note to Augusta regarding some alteration in the text of their Society leaflet.</p><p>For his part, Toby had gone to sleep.</p><p>Well, he supposed, different women had differing reactions following the coital act. Some found languor and sleep, while others experienced a burst of energy. And no matter what task Isabel rose from their bed to complete, in time she always came back. Toby could understand the habit, on a rational level, and he hardly knew how to object. But he still felt a small surge of resentment, each time he lazily stretched to embrace his wife and grasped nothing but air. The coach rolled to a halt in the town square.</p> <p>\u201cHere we are, then,\u201d Toby said, leaning forward in his seat. He took his wife\u2019s hand. \u201cShall I have the driver take you on to Wynterhall? Our trunks have likely arrived by now, and the house staff will be expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I don\u2019t want to go on to the house, not alone. I want to stay here with you, and watch the proceedings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel, it\u2019s only the nomination of candidates ... a trifling matter of procedure and an excuse to tap a few kegs of ale. Not a referendum on the human condition. Besides, the hustings can become disorderly. This isn\u2019t a scene for a lady.\u201d</p><p>She peered out the carriage window. \u201cBut there are several ladies in the crowd already. Please, let me stay. If you like, I\u2019ll sit in the carriage and watch from here. I want to witness the birth of your political career.\u201d With a little smile, she added, \u201cAnd I\u2019d so looked forward to hearing your speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you?\u201d Toby asked, suddenly wishing he\u2019d prepared one.</p> <p>Isabel asked the coachman to retract the landau top so she might enjoy the open air. From her vantage point at the edge of the square, she watched the crowd churn with anticipation. The taverns bordering the green were doing a brisk business, and the dry-goods merchants as well. Wandering piemen and orange-sellers hawked their wares in colorful song. Above all, a string of bright banners fluttered in the breeze. Bel had never attended a country fair, but in her imagination, they looked much like this.</p><p>A man wearing an outmoded jonquil-yellow topcoat mounted the hustings platform and called out to the throng. His voice was every bit as loud as his coat. Bel could tell from his proud bearing, he took his duties very seriously.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d he called. \u201cWe all know how this goes. As your returning officer, empowered by the sheriff to oversee this election, I\u2019ve summat to read aloud.\u201d He withdrew a folded sheaf of parchment from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we skip over that part?\u201d a voice whined from the crowd.</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t skip over that part,\u201d the yellow-clad man mimicked back. He shook his clutch of papers and fortified his booming voice. \u201cIt\u2019s procedure, you idiot. It\u2019s government. It\u2019s this paper what separates us from the heathens.\u201d</p><p>Another bystander called out, \u201cIt\u2019s that paper what makes you a pompous arse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it ain\u2019t,\u201d a third shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s that bloody coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, gents, it\u2019s neither.\u201d This came from a round-cheeked woman draped over the sill of a second-story window. \u201cHe\u2019s a pompous arse, wearing nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>The crowd roared with laughter, and the yellow-clad man\u2019s face turned a violent shade of red.</p><p>\u201cI only wish he\u2019d read me that paper some night,\u201d she continued. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be any more boring than his\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bel couldn\u2019t make out the remainder of her remark. A fresh storm of laughter drowned it out. Still, she blushed as her mind filled in the blank.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d the man in the yellow coat berated the crowd. \u201cDrink your ale, you uncivilized idiots. And you, woman\u201d\u2014he waved a finger at the cackling figure in the window\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll paddle your meddling arse six shades of red this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Colin,\u201d she sang out, fluttering her eyelashes. \u201cDo you promise?\u201d</p><p>When the crowd finally settled\u2014several minutes later\u2014the man in the yellow coat began to read. Bel understood why the crowd had protested the idea. First there was the writ calling for a new Parliament, and then the act against bribery. Then another man came forward, to administer the officer\u2019s oath against bribery. And as the gears of government creaked along, the sun inched higher in the sky, baking the square with soporific heat. Soon the horses were stamping and whickering with impatience. The coachman\u2019s head slumped to the side, and even Bel was swallowing back a yawn.</p> <p>Finally, the yellow-clad returning officer put out the call for nominations.</p><p>\u201cMontague!\u201d the crowd roared as one. They repeated the name until it became a three-syllable chant: \u201cMon-ta-gue! Mon-ta-gue!\u201d</p><p>Montague? Who was Montague, and why had Bel not heard of him if he possessed such a loyal following? She\u2019d thought Mr. Yorke posed Toby\u2019s only opposition. A bent, decrepit man mounted the platform, helped up the stairs by a man half his age and twice his size. He wore a faded Army redcoat with tarnished buttons and cuffs worn white at the edge. The crowd\u2019s chanting increased in volume until he doddered to the center of the stage and snapped a military salute.</p><p>To a man, the assembled electors came to attention and saluted in return.</p><p>\u201cAll hail Madman Montague!\u201d a man cried out from the throng.</p><p>The hulking man at the candidate\u2019s elbow made a threatening gesture with his fist. \u201cDon\u2019t you be disrespecting the colonel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on. Ain\u2019t as though he can hear me.\u201d</p><p>The man in the yellow coat regained control of the stage. \u201cColonel Geoffrey Montague is hereby a candidate for the office of Member of Parliament.\u201d</p><p>A general cheer rose up again. The old man saluted with even greater vigor, sending the epaulette of his uniform askew.</p><p>Bel understood it now. The crowd took amusement at this old man\u2019s expense. He must present himself as a candidate in every election, with no serious hopes of winning, and the people of the borough took from him a hearty laugh. It was pathetic, really. Poor thing.</p><p>\u201cOthers?\u201d the man in the yellow coat called out.</p><p>\u201cI nominate our esteemed incumbent, local freeholder and my friend, Mr. Archibald Yorke.\u201d It was Toby\u2019s voice. Wasn\u2019t that a bit odd, Bel thought, for a man to nominate his own opponent? But perhaps it was a show of good sportsmanship on Toby\u2019s part. Mr. Yorke mounted the platform, accepting the crowd\u2019s generous applause with a gracious nod. He spied Bel in her carriage and tipped his hat, his silvered hair glinting white in the sun. A twinge of conscience pinched her, to think that Toby would usurp not only this old man\u2019s seat in Parliament, but this accompanying measure of public respect. How sad for Mr. Yorke. But then she remembered Lady Aldridge\u2019s dislike of the man. Bel trusted her mother-in-law\u2019s judgment. Besides, Mr. Yorke was a Tory, which meant he sat in opposition to nearly every cause she intended to champion.</p><p>Mr. Yorke has had his time. It\u2019s Toby\u2019s turn now.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then that\u2019s done,\u201d the returning officer said. \u201cAny others?\u201d he asked, in a tone that said he expected none.</p><p>Mr. Yorke tapped him on one yellow-covered shoulder. \u201cI have a nomination to make.\u201d</p><p>The crowd quieted, seemingly as confused as Bel by this statement from the incumbent MP.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re already nominated,\u201d the officer replied.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019d like to nominate someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else? Well, I don\u2019t know that you can.\u201d The officer riffled through his sheaf of papers. \u201cSeeing as you\u2019re already a candidate ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a freeholder in this district, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Mr. Yorke asked gruffly. \u201cWell then, I can nominate a candidate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI nominate Sir Tobias Aldridge.\u201d</p><p>The crowd reacted with silence. Men looked from one to another, seemingly uncertain whether to laugh or applaud.</p><p>Bel decided to pity their indecision. As Toby mounted the platform, she clapped heartily, and soon a wave of polite applause built, sweeping toward the stage. Toby removed his hat and made an agile bow. The interest level of the ladies scattered through the assembly increased appreciably. They did not merely look; they gawped.</p><p>And who could blame them? Oh, he looked so handsome. The golden highlights of his hair caught the sunlight and reflected it to dazzling effect. The white gleam of teeth in his charming, boyish grin was visible even from here, at the edge of the square. Had he not been attired in such elegant clothes and so animated with youth and vitality, one could have mistaken him for a purloined Greek sculpture. A possessive sense of pride swelled her heart, to think that this tall, dashing figure of a man commanding the admiration of hundreds\u2014he belonged to her.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is interesting,\u201d the man in the yellow coat said, scratching the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cSeems we may actually need to count votes this year. We haven\u2019t done that in a generation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeeches!\u201d someone called from the crowd.</p><p>The request was quickly seconded, and soon the whole assembly clamored for oration.</p><p>\u201cSpeeches! Speeches!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d The yellow-clad man indicated Mr. Yorke. \u201cWe\u2019ll hear from the incumbent first, if you please.\u201d</p><p>Bel had not heard many political speeches in her life. In fact, this one counted as her first. Still, Mr. Yorke\u2019s address from the hustings struck her as very odd. For one thing, it was short\u2014</p><p>barely a few minutes in duration. For another, he spoke not a word on any matter of legislative importance. He merely reminded the electors of his years of service in the House of Commons, cobbled together a few phrases about service and progress, and promptly ceded the floor. Bel was almost offended on Toby\u2019s behalf. Did Mr. Yorke think so little of Toby\u2019s threat to his candidacy that he would first nominate Toby himself, then make only the slightest attempt to woo the electorate? While the crowd rewarded Mr. Yorke with a smattering of polite applause, she sniffed and busied herself arranging the folds of her skirts across the carriage seat. Well, perhaps she should be grateful for Mr. Yorke\u2019s overconfidence and underestimation of her husband. Once Toby took the platform, he would charm the votes right out of the old man\u2019s pocket.</p><p>A roar of excitement rose up from the milling throng. Bel looked up to see the ancient Colonel Montague shuffling to the center of the stage. Merciful heavens, why did they have to put the old man through such humiliation, just for a bit of entertainment? Did so little of interest happen in this borough?</p><p>The crowd hushed as Montague snapped another open-palmed salute.</p><p>\u201cDuty!\u201d The word creaked from the old man\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cDuty!\u201d the assembly echoed, at a volume magnified one thousandfold.</p><p>\u201cHonor!\u201d Montague called.</p><p>\u201cHonor!\u201d came the unified roar. Fists pumped in the air.</p><p>The aged colonel raised both arms as high as he could. Which ended up being barely shoulderlevel. \u201cVigilance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVigilance!\u201d the crowd returned, overlapping the colonel\u2019s own cry. It was clear this was a familiar litany to everyone in attendance.</p><p>Everyone but Bel, that was. She looked around the square. Hadn\u2019t Toby called this a sedate borough, not prone to rioting? Over the waving arms of the crowd, she managed to catch her husband\u2019s eye. He gave her a carefree shrug and a cheeky wink, apparently unconcerned. She could not say the same for the team of horses, who stamped and whickered with each rousing cry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy friends and neighbors,\u201d Montague addressed the crowd, \u201cour noble country faces a threat. An enemy more pernicious than any Moorish infidel or encroaching barbarian.\u201d</p><p>Who on earth did he refer to? Surely not Napoleon. The Battle of Waterloo was three years ago now.</p><p>\u201cNo, our enemy attacks not from without,\u201d the old man continued, \u201cbut from within.\u201d His voice trembled, as did his raised fist. \u201cYes, I speak of traitors. Those vile betrayers who would raise arms against their own king.\u201d</p> <p>Now Bel was thoroughly confused. At the moment, England wasn\u2019t even under the rule of a king. No one in the crowd seemed especially concerned about infidels or traitors, however. The general mood remained one of amusement.</p><p>\u201cWe must quell the rebellion,\u201d Montague went on. \u201cIt is the moral imperative of every Englishman to stamp out the uprising, seek out the treasonous brigands, and bring them to justice. Secure England\u2019s rule and God\u2019s dominion, before the traitors come after you.\u201d He leveled one bony finger at the assembly and swept it in an arc, pivoting to stare down individual members of the crowd.</p><p>For a moment, his bent finger and wild-eyed gaze rested on Bel, and she shifted nervously on the carriage seat. She began to understand the large turnout for these proceedings. This was high drama indeed. How the carriage driver could sleep through it all was beyond her.</p><p>\u201cAttack is imminent,\u201d the old man warned, his voice cracking as its pitch soared. \u201cThe peril is real.\u201d With a shaking hand, he withdrew an old-fashioned pistol from his coat and waved it in the same arc his finger had just traced. The general mood of the onlookers went from amusement to concern. Apparently, this was not part of the script. A nervous murmur rippled through the square, and the horses danced with unease.</p><p>\u201cI call on every able-bodied man to join us. To take up arms with the Montague Militia. To secure our home county by answering the call: Duty! Honor! Vigilance!\u201d</p> <p>Montague pointed the pistol heavenward and called out, \u201cMake ready!\u201d</p><p>From behind her came a chorus of loud clicks. Bel pivoted in her seat to see a half-dozen men lining the rear edge of the square. One of them was the burly fellow who\u2019d helped Colonel Montague onto the platform. In unison, the men lifted muskets to their shoulders, pointing the barrels high into the air above the assembly. Accordingly, the people in the assembly threw themselves to the ground. Somewhere a woman screamed. Bel wasn\u2019t certain, but it might have been her.</p><p>\u201cAim!\u201d the colonel ordered, tightening his own bony finger over the trigger of his pistol.</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d</p><p>A salvo of shots fractured the silence, and then panic poured through the cracks. Deafened by the booming shots and smothered in acrid smoke, Bel could scarcely tell her boots from her bonnet. All around her, people swarmed and shouted. The pair of carriage horses reared and whinnied, and the landau rocked on its wheels before lurching forward into the crowd. And now there was no doubt about it. Bel really did scream.</p><p>The carriage driver, finally startled awake, hauled on the reins. \u201cHo, there! Ho!\u201d</p> <p>But the horses\u2019 panic would not be quelled. They charged forward, dragging the carriage on a wild, serpentine course through the square. Before them, people leapt and dove, scrambling out of the way. Bel clung to the door sash and prayed, expecting at any moment the carriage wheel would meet with a human obstacle and leave a maimed or lifeless body in its wake. Instead, the carriage wheel met with an inanimate obstacle\u2014the stone border of the sidewalk\u2014</p><p>and for a heart-stopping moment, the landau teetered on its two left wheels. Bel was thrown against the side of the cab, and the driver\u2014</p><p>Oh, God. The driver was thrown completely. The landau righted itself with a bouncing jolt, and Bel looked up to see the driver\u2019s box empty and the reins dangling. Then the reins, too, slipped from view.</p><p>With them went her last shred of hope. There was no way she could stop this carriage. Even if she could somehow leap the gap to the driver\u2019s seat; even if she could somehow retrieve the reins\u2014if an experienced coachman could not slow these horses, Bel had no hope of doing so herself. In their panic, the horses would drag her on until one of them stumbled or the carriage overturned. In all likelihood, she was going to die. It was only a matter of how many human and equine lives went with her.</p><p>Her impulse was to shrink low in the carriage and simply close her eyes until it was all over. But she couldn\u2019t even bring herself to move that far. Instead, she remained frozen, clutching the seatback and door sash in white-knuckled grips as the horses continued their frenzied rampage through the square.</p><p>Between the threats of musket fire and an out-of-control carriage, much of the crowd had already dispersed, the people squeezing into any available building or doorway. The remaining onlookers huddled around the hustings platform itself\u2014on it, under it, clinging to its girders. And, having careened off the sidewalk and altered their course, now the horses were headed straight for them.</p><p>No.</p><p>No, no, no. Not all those people.</p> <p>\u201cRun!\u201d she cried. And the people obeyed, fleeing the spurious safety of the wooden platform for the edges of the square. They scattered in different directions, but wise souls that they were, they all ran away.</p><p>Except for one. One man was running straight at her.</p><p>Toby.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>Bel\u2019s pounding heart rate kicked into a gallop.</p><p>Dear God, no, she prayed. Not Toby.</p><p>While everyone else in the square had spent the past thirty seconds fearing for his life, Toby had apparently used the time to shuck his topcoat. His arms were blurs of white linen as he leapt from the hustings platform and dashed out to meet the stampeding team.</p><p>\u201cToby, no!\u201d she screamed. \u201cMu\u00e9vete!\u201d</p><p>Madre de Dios. She needed to warn off her English husband, and suddenly her tongue could only work in Spanish. He was going to die, and it would be all her fault. Even now, the horses were gaining speed, bearing down on him. Any moment, he would be trampled, dragged under the carriage. She only prayed God would be merciful enough to take her with him.</p><p>As if he\u2019d come to his senses, Toby drew to a halt. Just in the perfect place for the horses to brush past him and the carriage wheels to grind him up.</p><p>But it never came to that.</p><p>As one horse came abreast of him, Toby changed course, now running alongside the panicked beast. He grabbed its mane with both hands and jumped, vaulting onto the horse\u2019s back. Bel looked on in disbelief as Toby grabbed the reins near the bit and tugged with one hand, pulling the horse\u2019s head to the side. The team and carriage followed, turning in a tight spiral. Flung against the side of the cab once again, Bel muttered incoherent prayers and imprecations in her mother\u2019s tongue. All the while, Toby soothed the horses, and her, with his deep, steady baritone.</p><p>\u201cHo, there,\u201d he told them. \u201cEasy now.\u201d</p><p>Holding the reins firmly, he kept the team turning in a circle, murmuring succinct commands and words of assurance. Gradually, the hoofbeats slowed. Bel\u2019s thundering pulse slowed, too. Toby eased up on the bit, steering the team off the green and onto a side road. They ambled on for several minutes thus\u2014Toby droning on in a hypnotic monologue, holding tight to the reins, never turning his attention from the horses. As they moved away from the center of town, the dwellings they passed grew smaller, further apart. The cobblestones paving their path gave way to dirt, muffling the horses\u2019 hoofbeats. The world felt very quiet. Finally, Toby drew the team to a halt where a wooden stile marked the boundary between town road and country lane. Sliding down from the horse\u2019s back, he lavished pats and verbal praise on the mare as he looped the reins around the stile.</p><p>Then\u2014at last\u2014he turned to Bel.</p><p>\u201cSoftly now,\u201d he said, approaching the carriage door and unlatching it with a gentle click. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to startle them again.\u201d He held out a hand to her.</p><p>Bel stared at it. She\u2019d been clutching the onto carriage with both hands for so long, she couldn\u2019t muster the courage to release them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right now,\u201d he said, in the same deep, soothing tone in which he\u2019d spoken to the mare.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>That tone worked on her, too. She gave him her trembling hand, and he helped her down from the landau\u2014slowly, cautiously\u2014supporting her with one arm about her waist. There were no people milling about the nearby cottage; presumably its occupants had assembled at the square. Wordlessly, he led her over to a low wall of stone, beyond which farmland spread like a rumpled quilt.</p><p>Lifting her effortlessly, he set her on the wall and stood back a step. His eyes scanned her from head to toe as he assessed her condition. \u201cAre you well?\u201d he asked, frowning with concern. With sure fingers, he untied her bonnet and set it aside. He lifted one of her arms, then the other, running his hand along each to test the soundness of her bones and joints. \u201cYou\u2019re not injured? You took such a blow with that turn, I\u2019m concerned for your ribs.\u201d He placed his hands flat against her torso, framing her ribcage.</p><p>\u201cToby,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He did not lift his head. \u201cAre you hurt here at all? Any difficulty drawing a breath? Do you feel any pain when I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d Bel raised a hand to his lips, damming the stream of anxious speech. Then she slid her palm along his smooth-shaven jaw.</p><p>Exhaling slowly, Toby closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m unharmed, thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>His hands slid around her waist, and he gathered her to him tightly. Tightly enough that, had she truly suffered a broken rib, there would have been no denying it.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he said, sighing into her hair and gently rocking her in his arms. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>Bel buried her face in the linen of his shirt, now softened with heat and the scents of both man and horse. And then she began to weep.</p><p>\u201cYes, darling,\u201d he murmured, stroking her back. \u201cGo ahead, cry. The danger is over and you are unharmed, and for that you may weep just as long as you wish. Shed tears enough for us both, if you\u2019d be so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Toby.\u201d After a time, she sniffed against his waistcoat. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so frightened in all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it?\u201d She lifted her face to his.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his brown eyes growing thoughtful. \u201cNo, I think it makes us one. Doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Bel nodded as he lowered his lips to hers. Yes, she understood perfectly. Nearly a week ago, they\u2019d been married. She\u2019d lost count of the times they\u2019d engaged in the marital act since. But only now, in this moment, did she feel truly wed to him. As though they shared one future, one life. For better or worse, in safety and in peril. He\u2019d risked his life to save hers, and now\u2014now there was no more \u201chis life\u201d or \u201chers.\u201d This was their life now. And their life began with a sweet, tender kiss.</p><p>The kiss didn\u2019t stay sweet or tender for long.</p><p>Toby tried to hold back. He really did. But one stroke of her tongue against his, and the reins of his passion slid straight out of his grip.</p><p>So he filled his hands with Isabel instead.</p><p>With artless greed, he clutched at her hips, her breasts, her bottom, her thighs. He wound the fingers of one hand into her hair and cinched it so tight, she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured against her throat. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. But Isabel... Christ, I need this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, tugging at his cravat. \u201cI need it, too.\u201d</p><p>He needed to feel her. All of her. Every living, unharmed inch of her body. For a terrifying moment, she\u2019d been lost to him. She\u2019d been safely returned, thank heaven, but it wasn\u2019t enough to simply see her alive and hear her say she was well. He needed to feel it. To verify with his hands, lips, tongue that each glossy strand of hair and silky curve of her flesh remained exactly the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsabel.\u201d He groaned as she worked her hands under his collar and her fingernails raked against his bare flesh. \u201cYou have to stop me. God knows, I can\u2019t stop myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Three more arousing syllables were never spoken.</p> <p>He had so much energy coursing through him\u2014the fuel of resolve and desperation and veinchilling fear. And now that there was nothing to fear, no desperate crisis... all that energy simmered inside him, building, rising, needing release. He wanted nothing more than to get inside her and let it all explode. Right here, on this stone wall\u2014which seemed to be just the perfect height, God bless the world.</p><p>And God bless his wife, she pulled up her skirts so he could nestle his hips between her thighs and test that theory.</p><p>Yes. A low moan escaped them both as he pressed the hard ridge of his erection against her feminine core. Just exactly the perfect height. Now it was only a matter of removing these bothersome layers of fabric ...</p><p>He snaked one hand under her petticoat. Her thigh went rigid beneath his palm.</p><p>\u201cToby, someone\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>He rested his brow on her shoulder and cursed. Someone\u2019s coming. Oh, why, why, why, why couldn\u2019t it be him?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the coachman,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Toby said. Stepping back, he released her thigh and rearranged her skirts with sullen tugs. \u201cNow I can kill him.\u201d</p><p>Here came that gently reproving Isabel look, and the matching patient tone. \u201cToby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I know you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll sack him. Without a reference. And then I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault.\u201d</p> <p>No, it was mine, Toby thought ruefully. He should never have let her stay. He should have anticipated the melee. He should never have agreed to run for office in this blighted borough in the first place. \u201cAre you well enough to drive home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She paled. \u201cMust we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Toby. I can\u2019t get back in that carriage right now, not with those horses. Not today. I just can\u2019t.\u201d Tears welled in her eyes, catching on the ebony fringe of her lashes.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I understand, darling.\u201d He cast a glance over her shoulder, out at the countryside. \u201cWynterhall is only about two miles\u2019 distance, if we cut across the fields. Would you prefer to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Her face brightened. \u201cI would prefer it. In fact, I suspect I\u2019d enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Toby suspected he would, too. There were any number of stone borders between here and his estate. Haystacks, too, and smooth-barked trees. Yes, walking could prove a very enjoyable alternative to traveling by carriage.</p><p>He exchanged a few words with the driver and then vaulted the wall before swinging Isabel around and helping her down the other side. She laughed. It was a giddy, girlish sort of laugh that he didn\u2019t recall ever hearing from her before. He liked it.</p> <p>He took her hand, and together they started off across the field.</p><p>For some time, they did not talk. It seemed too soon to speak about what had happened in the square, but also too soon to think of anything else. So they simply walked in silence. They walked like children, letting their linked hands swing between them as they made large, purposeful strides past the knee-high grain. First fast, then slow, then quickly again as they gathered momentum coming down a slope.</p><p>When they reached the opposite edge of the field, Toby helped her squeeze through a gap in the hawthorn hedgerow.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment,\u201d he said, once they\u2019d both made it through. \u201cYou\u2019ve a bit of bramble in your hair.\u201d He disentangled the offending twig and held it up for her inspection before tossing it aside.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She blushed, popping up on her toes to kiss him.</p><p>It was lovely, that kiss. Petal-soft, and innocent. And it told Toby instantly that he would not be tumbling his wife against a tree, somewhere along the journey home. All that sensual urgency between them earlier\u2014they\u2019d lost it somewhere in that barley field. Now it was comfort that warmed the place where his fingers grazed her wrist. Comfort, and companionship, and a general sense of all being well with the world. Toby couldn\u2019t honestly say it was better than sexual release. But neither could he say it was worse.</p><p>It was different. Different from anything he\u2019d known with a woman before. He was still pondering it minutes later, when Isabel gasped and drew to a halt in the center of a pasture.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour speech!\u201d She clapped her free hand over her mouth and turned to him, smothering a burst of giddy laughter with her palm. Lowering her hand, she continued, \u201cOh, Toby. You never made your speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you mind.\u201d Chuckling, he squeezed her hand as they continued walking. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though anyone would have listened after that uproar, now is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... but what happened? That Colonel Montague and his strange speech, the musket fire ...</p><p>I still don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColonel Montague is our local war hero. He stands for every election and has done for decades. Always runs on a platform of subduing treasonous rebellion in the American colonies.\u201d</p><p>Isabel slanted a look at him. \u201cHaven\u2019t the American colonies been independent for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-five years? Yes. He\u2019s not called Madman Montague for nothing. The old soldier\u2019s a bit touched in the head, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had. And I thought it was horrid, how his illness was exploited for the public\u2019s amusement. The poor man.\u201d</p><p>Toby refrained from noting that the \u201cpoor man\u201d had very nearly got her killed today. Just like his sweet wife, to look back on the afternoon\u2019s horror and feel nothing but sympathy for the decrepit sot. \u201cIt\u2019s not so mean-spirited as you might think. The old fellow enjoys the attention; the crowd enjoys his enthusiasm. He never gets any votes that don\u2019t come from those oafish nephews of his; but one could say he achieves his goal just the same.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a skeptical look.</p><p>\u201cHe rallies the borough,\u201d Toby explained. \u201cFor an entirely fictional cause, to be sure, but the unity he engenders is real. It can\u2019t be a completely bad thing, for the townspeople to gather every few years and answer the call of duty, honor, vigilance.\u201d He recited the words with gusto and gave her a wide grin.</p><p>She was not amused. \u201cI take it the musket salute is not usually part of the routine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. That part was a surprise, I assure you. And I\u2019m certain this will have been Montague\u2019s last candidacy. Wild-eyed speeches are one thing, but he\u2019ll not be permitted to pull a stunt like that again.\u201d Toby shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t know what the old fool will live for now. It\u2019s a bit tragic, really.\u201d</p><p>Isabel replied hotly, \u201cWhat\u2019s tragic is a man stripped of his dignity. If he\u2019s touched in the head, as you say, he should be pitied and protected. Not paraded before the town every few years as a laughing stock.\u201d Her accent grew increasingly pronounced as she spoke; her strides became clipped. \u201cMadness is a serious condition, not a joke.\u201d</p><p>Toby couldn\u2019t recall ever seeing her so agitated. Was this some misdirected reaction to the day\u2019s distressing events? The way she defended Montague so vigorously, one would think she had a personal reason to take offense.</p><p>Bloody hell. She did. Toby silently cursed his thoughtlessness.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten your mother\u2019s illness.\u201d Her fingers slipped in his grasp, but Toby tightened his grip. She wouldn\u2019t get away from him that easily. \u201cForgive me, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about my mother\u2019s illness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray told me. Before we were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd it didn\u2019t disturb you at all?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy should it disturb me, that your mother contracted brain fever?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an incredulous look, as though the answer ought to be obvious. \u201cBecause she went mad. No one wants to marry into a family with a history of insanity.\u201d Her eyes fell to the carpet of grasses and wildflowers. \u201cI should have told you myself, but I was afraid you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid I would change my mind?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Toby pulled her close and wrapped an arm about her waist. He wasn\u2019t certain how to reassure her. He could tell her that of all the potentially objectionable things about her family\u2014their precarious social standing, her connections in trade, her bastard half-brother Joss, her other half-brother Gray, who was his own brand of bastard ... not to mention the fact that her sisterin-law was the woman who\u2019d jilted him not one year ago\u2014the information that her mother had narrowly survived a tropical fever would hardly have tipped the scales. But he suspected that little speech wouldn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cDarling, I can assure you\u2014your mother\u2019s condition never gave me a moment\u2019s pause. Everyone\u2019s family has some sort of madness in it. If you think there\u2019s none in my own ...</p><p>well, you simply haven\u2019t spent enough time around my sister Fanny yet.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. It wasn\u2019t quite the girlish laugh he\u2019d been trying for, but it was an improvement. Soon she grew thoughtful again. \u201cSometimes I wonder if my mother truly was touched in the head, as you call it. Perhaps she was simply heartbroken and angry. She loved my father, and he ...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off. Curious as he was to hear the end of that sentence, Toby suspected prompting would not result in its completion. They covered a good bit of ground before she finally continued.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, my mother disagreed with the doctors. She did not believe she was mad. Not from a fever, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut mad people never know they\u2019re mad. That\u2019s part of their illness. Do you think Colonel Montague believes he\u2019s mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d She frowned.</p><p>\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t stand for election if he did. That\u2019s the paradox of it\u2014if you\u2019re aware that you\u2019re mad, then you\u2019re not mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s nonsensical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d He gave her a reassuring squeeze. \u201cMontague\u2019s nephews don\u2019t accept the extent of his illness, either, or they wouldn\u2019t have put on that display today. It\u2019s only natural, for people to believe the best of their loved ones. Their affection blinds them to the truth. Love is its own form of madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My mother said that, too.\u201d</p><p>She fell into a ponderous silence. They walked on together, joined at the hip.</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen now?\u201d she asked, as they entered a copse of beech trees. \u201cWith the election?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin Brooks\u2014\u201d He kicked a stone out of their path. \u201cHe\u2019s the returning officer ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one in the horrid yellow coat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d Toby laughed. \u201cHe\u2019ll set a date for the polling to begin, probably a few days hence. There\u2019ll be speeches at the hustings every day, and the accumulated votes tallied each afternoon. When one candidate has a clear majority, they\u2019ll close the polls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back there,\u201d she said, shuddering.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t allow you to return, if you did. Even I don\u2019t have to attend. Some candidates stay away from the hustings entirely, and let their supporters speak for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you must attend! How else will you persuade the electors to give you their votes?</p><p>You never had a chance to address them today.\u201d She looked up at him through her lashes.</p><p>\u201cThough if your heroics with the horses did not convince them of your suitability, I don\u2019t know what will. The way you leapt onto that moving horse ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally, it was nothing,\u201d Toby said, in a tone of false humility that he knew would draw him even more praise. Isabel\u2019s admiration was perhaps a bit more than he deserved, but he wasn\u2019t about to spurn it.</p><p>\u201cIt was wonderful. And terrifying. Oh, Toby. I was so certain you would be trampled.\u201d</p><p>She nestled close to him, and he let his hand wander down the curve of her hip. Really\u2014</p> <p>shouldn\u2019t a daring rescue like that entitle a man to a few liberties? Here he\u2019d been wanting to slay a dragon for her, and Toby supposed subduing a panicked carriage horse was as close as he\u2019d ever get.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, resting her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cReally, the trick of it\u2019s all in the timing. And it\u2019s Mr. Yorke you ought to thank,\u201d Toby replied, breathing in the delicious scent of her hair. \u201cI\u2019d never have learned that maneuver if not for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother forbade me to practice that vault, you see. Told me I\u2019d break my neck. So naturally, Yorke encouraged me just to spite her. I spent most of my fourteenth summer in his eastern pasture, practicing. Took me weeks, and I took my share of nasty spills, but I finally mastered the way of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can understand why your mother objected. It sounds horribly dangerous.\u201d She raised her head and looked up at him. \u201cWhy on earth did you want to learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my heart set on joining the cavalry. Though deep down, I knew I never could. With my father gone, it was too great a risk. If I died without an heir, my mother and sisters would be left alone. Still, at fourteen I had my dreams. Pictured myself charging around French battlefields, spilling Bonapartist blood.\u201d</p><p>Toby laughed a little. Ah, to be young and spend hours spinning detailed, grandiose fantasies of changing the world. Isabel certainly wasn\u2019t a girl any longer, but she\u2019d somehow retained that youthful idealism he\u2019d long outgrown. He didn\u2019t always understand her zeal, but he did admire it. At times, he envied it. Honor, Justice, Charity ... the way she pronounced those terms, he could hear the capital letters implied. They were words she spoke often, but never lightly. And she took the same earnest tone when she spoke of being a Lady, with a capital L. Toby hadn\u2019t thought much of being a Sir since he was a boy, envisioning himself the hero of a lost Arthurian legend: Sir Toby the Valiant. Isabel made him feel that there could be something to this whole notion of nobility, aside from assuming his place in the throng of bored aristocrats\u2014men with nothing better to do of an afternoon than sit at the club swilling brandy. Perhaps he could make his title something more than just the fading gleam on a centuries-old suit-of-armor.</p><p>Or perhaps Isabel could.</p><p>\u201cCavalry or no, that vault turned out to be a useful trick.\u201d He squeezed her hand and donned a devilish grin. \u201cSoon I came to appreciate its other application.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy, impressing the young ladies, of course.\u201d He brushed a light kiss on her lips. \u201cDid it work?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, blushing.</p><p>\u201cVery good. Let\u2019s see if I can impress you further.\u201d He thrust his free arm under her hips and swept her off her feet.</p><p>She squeaked with surprise. \u201cToby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I like that noise,\u201d he said, holding her in his arms as he crossed the shallow stream. \u201cCan you make that one again?\u201d he asked, lowering her to her feet. \u201cLater tonight?\u201d</p><p>She dismissed his teasing with a little wave of her hand and walked on ahead.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rather bold of you,\u201d he said, grinning at the enticing sway of her hips as she marched away. \u201cHow do you know you\u2019re not walking the wrong direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she asked, without pausing to look back.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d</p><p>He watched her walk a few paces more before starting after her. Following her path at a leisurely pace, he twisted a length of ivy from a nearby branch and worked it with both hands.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he called. \u201cHold right there.\u201d</p><p>She paused, framed between two trees\u2014standing in the doorway between this small, shaded grove and the sunlit world beyond. A corona of golden light surrounded her, caressing every lush curve of her silhouette.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Toby couldn\u2019t even answer. He just stood there, blinking, awestruck by the vision of loveliness before him. Swallowing the lump in his throat, he slowly approached his wife. One by one, he pulled the pins from her hair as she looked up at him, adorably befuddled. At last her dark tresses tumbled free, and she arranged them about her shoulders with an unconscious toss of her head.</p><p>\u201cThere, that\u2019s better.\u201d Grinning like a fool, Toby adorned her gleaming ebony crown with the ivy wreath he\u2019d fashioned, then framed her bewildered smile in his hands. \u201cIsabel, I know I\u2019ve told you this a hundred times or more. And now I regret not saving the words for this moment. For that matter, I regret ever speaking them to anyone else, because now the words seem too paltry, too common. Completely inadequate. But I promise you, I\u2019ve never meant them more honestly than I do right here, right now. You are ... beautiful. Truly, you take my breath away.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cOh, my. Now that was impressive indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she laughed. \u201cEven I\u2019m breathless, and I\u2019m not romantic by nature. I can\u2019t imagine what that little speech must have done to your young, impressionable ladies.\u201d</p><p>Toby felt his grin fading. He\u2019d never made that speech to anyone else. The crown of ivy nonsense, countless times\u2014but never that speech. Those words were for her alone.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize I\u2019ve already married you?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd here you are pulling out all your best tricks. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said honestly. What an astute question she posed. Why, indeed? Out of habit? Simply for sport?</p><p>No. No, it was because he knew\u2014they both knew\u2014he might have stolen her away from Gray, wedded and bedded her, even rescued her from certain peril, but he hadn\u2019t yet engaged her heart. He, who had female hearts flung at him with all the frequency, and velocity, of cricket balls\u2014hadn\u2019t secured the adoration of his own wife.</p><p>And she was his wife. For what ever shallow reasons he\u2019d begun this courtship\u2014for the first time in his life, Toby was out of his depth. Isabel was a woman of strong principles and simmering passions. It would take more than adolescent flirtation to touch her heart. But her heart was the only one that mattered. He had to win it before he lost the election, or he might never have a chance again.</p><p>She looked out at the sloping hillside beyond the woods. \u201cI think we must be nearing your estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat stream was the property line, as a matter of fact. How could you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour whole manner has changed,\u201d she said, placing her hands on his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re ...</p><p>boyish. Carefree. Full of mischief.\u201d She smoothed his waistcoat with her palms. Toby knew it wasn\u2019t wrinkled. She simply wanted to touch him.</p><p>And God, did he want to touch her. It was all coming back now, the rush of desperate need.</p><p>\u201cFull of mischief, I\u2019ll grant you.\u201d Sliding his hands to her backside, he backed her up a step, so that she stood braced against the trunk of a tree. \u201cBut boyish?\u201d He ground his hips against hers, eliciting her small gasp. \u201cI have to disagree with you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby,\u201d she said, her voice tight. Her open palms pressed against his chest. \u201cWe really should keep moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Very well.\u201d</p><p>He released her, but stayed close\u2014denying her the space to walk away. Heart pounding with lust and brain churning with confusion, he stared down at his wife\u2019s flushed countenance. She wouldn\u2019t even meet his eyes. Something was wrong, but damned if he knew how to name it. He couldn\u2019t understand why one minute she could be so passionate, even flirtatious, drawing him near\u2014and the next, pushing him away. As she said, they were already married. And today he\u2019d used all his most impressive tricks, and invented a few new ones in the bargain.</p><p>\u201cSomeday,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll take you back to visit Tortola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your home. Don\u2019t you miss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d She tried to wiggle past him, but he had her boxed in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see your childhood home. I wonder, would I see the girlish Isabel there? Carefree, full of mischief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Her tone was light. Falsely so. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I was ever full of mischief.\u201d</p><p>Nor carefree, he supposed. A hint of sadness pulled at the corner of her mouth, and Toby found himself wishing he could perform the truly impossible\u2014reach back in time to slay the dragons haunting her past.</p><p>She toyed with the end of his cravat where it hung loose about his neck, then looked off into the distance for a moment. A heartbeat later, those wide, dark eyes flashed up at him again.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re seeing her now.\u201d</p><p>With that, she plucked the cravat from his neck, ducked under his arm and ran off\u2014charging</p><p>up the hill, scattering laughter on the breeze behind her. Toby gave chase. Despite her head start, he gained on her quickly. He caught up to her at the crest of the hill, where she\u2019d stopped in her tracks with her back still to him. The cravat fluttered in her dangling hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve caught you now.\u201d He whipped one arm around her chest and reached for the cravat with the other. \u201cGive it here, you minx.\u201d</p><p>He encountered no resistance as he yanked the neck cloth from her grasp. She didn\u2019t even turn to look at him. Instead, she simply reclined against his chest and stared down at the valley below.</p><p>\u201cOh, Toby,\u201d she said in a tone of breathless awe. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Smiling through his labored breaths, he hugged her tight. He\u2019d been wrong. He did have one last trick up his sleeve, and this the most impressive one yet.</p><p>\u201cWhy, that\u2019s our home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>Isabel had always been a grateful sort. She had always been aware that her life situation was one of great wealth and comfort, relatively speaking. But if she had felt one source of deprivation in her girlhood, it was that she had grown up in a house with very few books. Very few books of interest to a young girl, at any rate. Still, she read any volume she could, several times over. There had been a book of fairy stories she could probably recite by heart even now, if she tried. And the frontispiece of that book was permanently engraved upon her memory. It depicted a castle. A smallish one, though stout. Fortified with a turret and moat, but made friendly by the ivy clinging to its stone face and the manicured gardens in its shadow. As a girl, Isabel had stared at that etching for more hours than she could count, imagining the homelands of her parents, dreaming of centuries long past, missing her brother when he was at Oxford, and sometimes simply wishing to be anywhere far, far away.</p><p>And now\u2014here it was. Her castle. Moat, turret, ivy, gardens ... it was an exact rendition of her girlhood dream, washed in brilliant color. Real.</p><p>\u201cHow can it be?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Toby\u2019s arms tightened around her waist. \u201cI told you we\u2019d be here soon enough. It isn\u2019t a long walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean ... I\u2019ve seen this place before. This very house, in a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She felt him shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt it. More than one artist has painted this prospect. When my great-great uncle had it built, he was excessively proud of the place. Invited just about everyone in England to come visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it hasn\u2019t been here for centuries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Not even one. It\u2019s only built in the medieval style, but it\u2019s quite modern inside. The old man had a rather romantic imagination, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Twisting her neck, Isabel looked up at him. \u201cI would say he shared the family talent for impressing young ladies.\u201d She looked back down at the fairy-tale vista. \u201cAnd you truly live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe truly live here. And you, my dear, are the lady of the keep.\u201d He released her waist and stepped to her side, kissing her hand gallantly before tucking it into his elbow. \u201cI\u2019m near famished. Shall we go home?\u201d</p><p>Together they picked their way down the gentle slope and through the hedge-rimmed gardens. As they approached the castle, Isabel was surprised to discover how much smaller it was than she\u2019d first thought. The proportions had been carefully designed to give a grand appearance from a distance. Up close, however, the house had a human scale that made it welcoming, rather than imposing. The moat was a clear, shallow pool dotted with lily-pads, and Toby was able to open the arched wooden door with one hand.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome to Wynterhall,\u201d he said. \u201cHope you don\u2019t find it too fanciful for your tastes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... it\u2019s enchanting.\u201d Truly, there was no other word. Bel stood gaping at the grand hall into which they had entered. It was oval-shaped, and capped with an oval skylight that, with the blue sky shining through, gave the appearance of a cabochon sapphire set in gold. The floor was tiled in an intricate pattern of black and white marble.</p><p>Toby led her toward a narrow stone staircase. \u201cOur chambers are upstairs.\u201d</p><p>As they ascended the steps, Bel was conscious of how their footfalls echoed through the silence. \u201cIs there no one else here? Have you no servants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have an army of servants,\u201d he replied as they reached the top of the staircase. He led her down a wide, carpeted hallway. \u201cThey are led by Mrs. Tremaine, the housekeeper, a woman of unflagging good spirits and infinite energy. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s prepared a completely overwhelming display to welcome you\u2014food, d\u00e9cor, music, every comfort you could imagine. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she\u2019s taught the parlormaids and footmen some sort of song and dance routine in your honor. That\u2019s why I sent word with the driver that they were to clear out for the afternoon. You\u2019ve had a trying day, and I thought a bit of restful quiet was in order. Meeting the servants, touring the estate\u2014all that can wait.\u201d</p> <p>Bel breathed a sigh of relief. He was right, she didn\u2019t feel up to a grand welcome just now.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u201d\u2014Toby pushed open one half of a set of double doors\u2014\u201cI directed them to bring your things here for the time being, to my suite.\u201d Ushering her inside with a rakish smile, he added,</p><p>\u201cAfter all, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re going to sleep apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d He paused. \u201cThat is, unless you wish to, in which case I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she interrupted, sorry to have caused him doubt. \u201cNo, this is fine.\u201d She wished she hadn\u2019t blurted the question out, but it was something that had already been on her mind. They\u2019d slept in the same bed every night of their marriage thus far, but Bel had been uncertain whether it was merely a honeymoon arrangement or a habit in the making.</p> <p>The latter, she hoped. She liked having him nearby. Heavens, what a wanton she was becoming! She would have thought her desire for him might have waned, now that the elements of curiosity and novelty had been removed.</p><p>But no. Not waning at all. Waxing by the day.</p><p>\u201cAt any rate,\u201d she said, \u201cit looks as though four or five of us could fit in that.\u201d She gestured toward the bed\u2014an enormous, ancient four-poster affair with golden velvet draperies and a jewel-toned coverlet. It was a bed fit for a king ... and a queen. And a handful of courtiers besides.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. The ancestral bed.\u201d Toby walked over to it and sat, bouncing on the high mattress.</p><p>\u201cNow this bed truly is centuries old, even if Wynterhall is not. I think my great-great uncle must have built the entire house around it.\u201d He patted the space next to him, and Bel accepted the invitation to sit. \u201cYes, this bed has served its purpose well. Generations of Aldridge heirs have been conceived under this canopy.\u201d</p><p>Taking her hand in his, he flopped on his back, leaving her no choice but to do the same. She could hear the devilish grin in his voice as he said, \u201cI shall do my best to make you pregnant in this bed.\u201d</p><p>Bel\u2019s cheeks burned as she stared up at the embroidered canopy. \u201cWhat a thing to say.\u201d She refrained from adding, if the past week had not constituted his best attempts at making her pregnant, she was quite uncertain what more to expect.</p><p>\u201cBut first,\u201d Toby said, releasing her hand and struggling up on his elbows, \u201cwe really must have something to eat. I did give instructions... Ah, there it is. I knew she would not disappoint.\u201d He rose from the bed. Bel turned on her side in preparation to follow, but he stilled her with a gesture. \u201cNo, stay right there. I\u2019ll just bring the tray.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre we to have a picnic, then?\u201d Bel rose to a sitting position, kicking off her slippers and folding her legs under her skirts. She unbuttoned the restrictive spencer of her traveling habit and laid it aside, leaving her dressed in a chemisette and skirt.</p><p>\u201cJust so.\u201d Toby returned, balancing a covered tray on one hand. Bel drank in the sight of him. When this marvelous castle had come into view, she\u2019d lost eyes for anything but Wynterhall. But now, Toby recaptured her full attention. With his untied cravat slung loose around his neck, his hair mussed, his skin aglow with sun and exertion ... she could have told him to skip the picnic and proceed straight to dessert.</p><p>But that just wasn\u2019t something Bel could say. She was a bit shocked at herself for even thinking it.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Tremaine will have my head,\u201d he said, uncovering the tray and setting it in the center of the bed. \u201cShe\u2019s likely prepared a ten-course feast downstairs, and here I\u2019m serving you cold chicken and bread as your first meal at Wynterhall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d Bel broke off a piece of bread and bit into it gratefully. She reached for a leg of chicken. Until he\u2019d placed the food before her, she hadn\u2019t realized how hungry she was.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cGood. Eat up, darling. This is why I requested simple fare. I knew you\u2019d not eat a morsel if it was accompanied by too much pomp and display.\u201d He sliced into a small wheel of cheese and held out a wedge to her. Her hands occupied with bread and chicken, she accepted the bite with her teeth.</p><p>Absurdly, her eyes misted as she chewed that little bit of cheese. Such an intimate, caring, husbandly gesture. He was right, she would never have accepted a bite of food from his fingers, had they been seated at table in an opulent dining room. Toby had known just the way to make her feel immediately comfortable in his home. She had simply grown comfortable with him.</p><p>After they ate, Toby cleared the tray and returned to the bed. \u201cNow,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you feeling? Are you certain you are unharmed after the ... after the incident earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, quite certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I ring for your maid? Perhaps you\u2019d like to undress, bathe, sleep ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll three, eventually\u2014but I\u2019m in no rush.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cAre you still feeling frightened? Do you need me to hold you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not frightened anymore.\u201d But oh, how I need you to hold me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate. Because I\u2019m still a bit rattled, truthfully, and I think I need to be held.\u201d</p><p>Reclining, he laid his head in her lap. \u201cThere, that\u2019s much better.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed the hair from his forehead.</p><p>He closed his eyes and sighed. \u201cYes. Much, much better. \u201c</p><p>She combed his golden-brown hair with her fingers, massaging his temples and scalp with light pressure and enjoying the little groan of pleasure that ensued. After a few minutes, his breathing steadied. He seemed on the verge of falling asleep.</p><p>Bel didn\u2019t want him to fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps ...\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps what?\u201d he mumbled back.</p><p>She lost her courage. Instead of the amorous suggestion she\u2019d intended, a flood of nonsense came forth. \u201cPerhaps we should ring for a maid to remove the tray. There\u2019s still so much food there; it would be a shame to let it spoil. Perhaps there\u2019s a servant who could take it home to his family.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou are always so good, always thinking of others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. It\u2019s so refreshing. Do you know how few ladies of your rank would think of sending leftover chicken home with the servants?\u201d</p><p>Bel shook her head. If only he could divine the true nature of her thoughts right now, he would understand just how selfish they were\u2014and how common, among ladies of every rank who chanced to look on this beautiful man. She ran her fingers through his hair again, and he nestled deeper into her lap. Her heartbeat raced, and a sweet, hollow ache built in her womb. Really, she was becoming quite desperate for him.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cIsabel, you are too good to be true. Tell me honestly, are your motives always so pure? Don\u2019t you ever want to do something that you know is just wrong?\u201d</p><p>She laughed dryly. \u201cOh, Toby. Only every time I look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His eyes flew open and locked with hers. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean ...\u201d Bel\u2019s face heated. She\u2019d meant it as a joke. He was supposed to laugh. But instead, his expression had gone completely serious. That would teach her to attempt humor.</p><p>\u201cSurely you must know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He rose from her lap and sat up, facing her. \u201cAre you saying you desire me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to force me to say it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou desire me,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAnd you think this is wrong.\u201d</p><p>Bel didn\u2019t know what to say. This was terrible. She\u2019d meant to compliment her husband, in the same way he always showered her with praise. And somehow she\u2019d managed to offend him. He took her hand. \u201cWe\u2019re married, Isabel. I\u2019m your husband. There\u2019s nothing at all wrong with desiring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d She chewed her lip. She\u2019d come this far; there could be no prevarication now. \u201cTo be truthful, it started long before we were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose ... from the first time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wanted you from the first, as well. All the more reason for us to have wed.\u201d He inched closer to her on the bed. \u201cAnd still, we did wait. We did everything properly, and believe me I know\u2014because doing it the proper way damn near killed me. But still, you think it\u2019s wrong. Why is that? Does it...\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cDoes the act feel unpleasant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Bel bounced on the mattress with the force of her disavowal. \u201cIt feels very pleasant indeed. Too pleasant, I fear. Anything that feels so good must be a little bit wrong.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, obviously dismayed. \u201cSo this is why you\u2019re always so eager to leave our bed,\u201d he said. \u201cAfterward. You feel guilty, having experienced pleasure, and you feel compelled to atone for it with some good deed.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. He was correct, in part. There was more to it than that, but Bel didn\u2019t know how to explain. How to tell him, that in those moments of physical release, she lost all other cares, all other motives, all thoughts of good or charity or even her husband? She lost her self. How could she tell him, that every time she slipped into that blissful nothingness, she was a little bit afraid that she would never find her way back?</p><p>\u201cIsabel,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t have you feeling that way about making love to me.\u201d</p><p>Fear gripped her heart. Did he mean they wouldn\u2019t make love anymore? She didn\u2019t want that. As conflicted as desire made her feel, she could not bring herself to reject it. Toby\u2019s eyes grew dark. With anger, she feared\u2014or perhaps, simply with determination. With his free hand, he slowly removed the cravat hanging loose round his neck. \u201cYou trust me. Don\u2019t you, Isabel?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she assured him, squeezing his fingers. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know ...\u201d he said, sliding his hand up to circle her wrist. \u201cAfter today, you must know\u2014I would give my life before I let you come to harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, her mouth going dry. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d She pictured him rushing straight for those panicked horses, risking death to save her. The memory quickened her pulse, until it throbbed against the pressure of his fingertips. And the way he stared at her now\u2014so intently, so possessively ... She\u2019d never been so aroused in her life.</p> <p>Her heartbeat only pounded more furiously as he wrapped the cravat about her wrist, winding it tight. What did he mean to do?</p><p>\u201cI do trust you,\u201d she assured him quickly. \u201cWith my life, with my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Yes, but not with your heart.\u201d</p><p>Bel had no answer to that. She had no more words in her head. She stared at the long swath of linen as he knotted it securely around her wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he said, hoarsely. \u201cI swear it. You are my wife, and I mean to have all of you. I shall win you one piece at a time, if I must. Give me your other hand.\u201d</p> <p>She could not refuse him. She could not have refused him anything at this moment. Her desire only grew as he bound her wrists together, slowly winding the smooth fabric over her galloping pulse, then cinching it tight. Between her legs, she softened and ached.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d he told her. \u201cFlat on your back.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed him willingly, allowing him to position her body as he wished. He arranged her diagonally on the bed, then lifted her arms, stretching her bound wrists over her head. She felt a series of sharp tugs as he tied the loose end of the cravat to the upper left bedpost.</p><p>\u201cIs it painful at all?\u201d he asked, testing the knot.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Bel could not pretend to understand why her husband was lashing her wrists to the bedpost, nor why her body quivered with excitement as he did so. But what ever his intended purpose, she knew he would not hurt her. Of that, she had no doubt.</p><p>He placed a pillow beneath her head, and she looked down at her body, still clad in her sensible, light-blue traveling habit. With her arms positioned thus, her breasts thrust upward, straining her buttons of her high-necked chemisette.</p><p>Toby\u2019s fingers went to the row of overworked buttons, freeing them with a series of swift, deft flicks of his fingers. Once all were undone, he pushed the sides of the garment aside to reveal her stays and light summer shift. He undid the small closures of her skirt and tugged the garment down over her hips, knees, stockinged feet.</p><p>\u201cThere now,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIsn\u2019t that more comfortable?\u201d</p><p>Comfortable? Was he teasing her again? She was tied to a bedpost. And any relief that normally accompanied the shedding of clothing was more than offset by the sweet tension coiling in her belly. Her breath rolled in her chest, shallow and quick, lifting her bosom in rhythmic waves.</p><p>He slid one hand up her thigh to untie her garter, then slowly rolled the stocking down her right leg. His fingertips brushed her sensitive inner thigh, caressed the vulnerable hollow of her knee, then swept down to the tingling arch of her foot. She shuddered with pleasure, twisting on the bed.</p><p>He grasped her ankle firmly. \u201cNow, Isabel. Can I trust you to remain still? Or must I use your stockings to bind your legs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...\u201d Her voice faltered, and she swallowed hard. \u201cI will be still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Spread your legs a bit wider, then.\u201d His voice was dark and brusque\u2014a tone she\u2019d come to know well, from their nightly encounters. A tone she\u2019d come to welcome, even adore. It thrilled her, to hear the impatient need in his voice. To know that he\u2019d passed the threshold of tender solicitude and gone over to raw, masculine want. And it gave her so much pleasure, to obey his terse directives. When he spoke to her thus, he absolved her of the burden of choice. She could not feel conflicted over her own feelings of desire, not with her husband demanding her willing compliance. It was simply her duty to please him, and to accept the pleasure he offered her, and she delighted in doing precisely as he bid.</p><p>Only later\u2014only afterward, did shame and regret creep out from the shadows. He removed her other stocking, putting her through the same slow, sweet torture as he drew the fine silk down her left leg and eased it over her foot. Sliding his hands back up to her waist, he undid the ties of her petticoat and whisked it down and away. He would not look her in the eye, but concentrated on his task as he placed his hands around her ribcage and rolled her slightly onto her side.</p><p>As his fingers yanked at the laces of her stays, a rush of air entered her lungs. Bel went dizzy with euphoria. The cravat chafed her wrists as she wriggled to help him remove the corset entirely. She was intoxicated with the delicious irony of it\u2014how he was binding her and freeing her at the same time.</p><p>And now she lay naked, except for her simple, unadorned shift. The thin muslin was damp with her perspiration and clung to her skin, growing increasingly translucent. Toby repositioned her on her back and knelt between her outstretched legs, just inches from the place where she throbbed and ached for him. She could clearly see the outline of his arousal, so large and male, pressing against the fall of his trousers. Her body bowed as her hips arched toward him in an instinctive invitation. She was desperate for him to possess her body, to take his pleasure from her.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what he had in mind.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said gruffly, smoothing his palms over her waist and pulling her chemise tight against her breasts. Her nipples hardened with the tantalizing friction. \u201cNot yet. I have bound you, Isabel\u2014not for my own pleasure, but for yours. And I shall not release you until you have reached your peak\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree times.\u201d</p><p>Three times? He couldn\u2019t be serious. She wrestled her bindings and drew one knee up, planting her foot on the mattress. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grasped her thigh and pushed her leg back down, gently but firmly. \u201cI thought you promised to remain still. Must I retrieve the stockings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes. \u201cNo,\u201d she said again, willing her body to relax. \u201cBut Toby, don\u2019t you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I want,\u201d he said, his voice regaining a bit of that devilish charm. \u201cBelieve me, I want.\u201d</p><p>Framing her between his arms, he leaned forward and drew her nipple into his mouth, licking and teasing it through the muslin of her shift. Her hips jerked upward as the pleasure lanced through her, and her mound brushed against his erection. He moaned around her nipple, then gave it a gentle bite. \u201cBe still,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Bel obeyed him, as best she could. She lay perfectly, miserably still as he leisurely suckled one breast, then the other. All the while, a terrible need built in the cleft of her legs. She felt her flesh swelling there, growing moist and ready. So ready.</p><p>She was far past ready and well into desperate when at last his hand slid down the length of her body, lingering over her breast, her hip, her thigh, and finally gathering to a fist around the hem of her shift. He drew the fabric up over her waist, then eased his palm up the slope of her inner thigh. As he approached her center, Bel panted with anticipation.</p><p>So close. Closer. Closer still, but just not quite\u2014</p><p>There.</p><p>His hand cupped her sex, and Bel couldn\u2019t lie still. She rocked against the heel of his hand\u2014</p><p>once, twice. And then she came, in a bright explosion of bliss and relief. With a throaty chuckle, Toby raised his head from her breast. \u201cMy, that was fast. Almost too fast. I shall have to take care, or this will all be over too soon.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be over soon enough for Bel. The climax had merely blunted the edge of her desire. She still ached for him, but now she felt a strange sense of remorse ... and guilt, that he was denying himself because of her.</p><p>\u201cToby, please,\u201d she said, lifting her head with great effort. \u201cRelease me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, my darling. I know this is the moment where you long to pop out of bed and pen charity leaflets, or roll bandages for the dispensary. But I shan\u2019t let you. I\u2019ll not allow you to do penance for something that isn\u2019t wrong. The desire between us\u2014it is nothing but what God intended for a husband and a wife.\u201d</p><p>Sitting back on his haunches, he drew her shift up and up, until her breasts were bared and the thin muslin bunched under her arms. \u201cLook how beautiful you are,\u201d he said, lightly stroking his hands over her nude, trembling body. \u201cYou are everything perfect and right.\u201d</p><p>Bel looked down at her full, rounded figure, illuminated by unforgiving sunlight. Lucidity pierced the fog of her brain. Heavens, it was only the middle of the day, and he had her tied nude to the bedpost... She hoped he\u2019d been serious when he\u2019d told her all the servants had been dismissed for the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cSo lovely,\u201d he murmured, gently spreading her legs.</p><p>Dear Lord. Must he examine her there? She closed her eyes, shivering with pleasure as his fingers explored her tender, sensitized flesh. Her bound hands curled into fists. \u201cToby, please stop.\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled, and he looked up. \u201cWhy? Am I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019re making me uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy touching you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy looking at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should you be uncomfortable? I\u2019m simply admiring my beautiful wife.\u201d Dropping his eyes again, he resumed stroking her, tenderly parting the folds of her sex. Bel squirmed. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you admire a different part of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admire every part of you.\u201d He withdrew his hand. He crawled up her body on hands and knees, surrounding her. Covering her, like a blanket. \u201cI admire this glorious dark hair ...\u201d He pressed a kiss to the crown of her head. \u201cThis stern, serious brow...\u201d His lips brushed the place between her eyebrows. \u201cThis exquisite nose ... these luscious lips... the adorable turn of your chin ...\u201d He trailed soft, sensual kisses from her nose, to her mouth, to her jaw. She wished she could thread her fingers into his hair, pull his mouth back up to hers for a deep, lingering kiss. But her hands remained bound above her, and Toby continued along his downward path.</p><p>\u201cThe delicious curve of this neck ...\u201d</p><p>He kissed his way down her center, pausing to rest his chin on her breastbone, plump her breasts with his hands, and give her a cheeky grin. \u201cAnd I think you know how much I admire the view of this happy valley.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dipped lower. \u201cYour navel tastes of apricots,\u201d he murmured, tickling her with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cIt does not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d he teased. \u201cAnd here ...\u201d He settled between her thighs and lowered his mouth to her core. \u201cHere, you taste of paradise.\u201d</p><p>Bel whimpered with pleasure as his lips and tongue caressed her most intimate place. She\u2019d grown more accustomed to this form of... attention, since their wedding night. He brought her to climax this way nearly every time they made love\u2014and clever devil that he was, he\u2019d learned how to bring her there quickly.</p><p>He\u2019d also learned\u2014clever devil that he was\u2014how to take his time.</p><p>He teased her mercilessly with his mouth and hands, until she was molten with desire. As he slid a finger inside her, she bit her lip so hard it bled.</p><p>\u201cCry out,\u201d he told her. \u201cDon\u2019t fight it. I live for those passionate noises you make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that was almost it. The one from earlier, you know\u2014when I carried you across the river?</p><p>Let\u2019s try once again.\u201d He pressed another finger into her.</p><p>\u201cToby!\u201d she scolded, her voice tweaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, yes. That\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>Growling with frustration, she arched against his hand. Finally he took pity on her and put that teasing mouth to better use. Within seconds, he had her crying out in exquisite pleasure. The second climax left her shuddering and weak. Her whole body sang with bliss, but she still ached for more. She needed him inside her, needed to feel that sense of completion when their bodies joined.</p><p>He stroked her thigh. \u201cWhat do you want, Isabel? Tell me. Ask me anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRelease me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything but that.

You\u2019re so passionate, you\u2019re frightened of it. Don\u2019t be.\u201d He gently caressed her between her legs. \u201cGod, you are so wet, so ready. You\u2019re wet for me. Ready for me. Don\u2019t deny it. Don\u2019t deny me. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want...\u201d</p> <p>I want you inside me.</p><p>She just couldn\u2019t say it, not like that. Not with him staring down at her in the full sunlight, while she lay bound to the bed. He had all the power in this situation, and while that had excited her earlier ... now she found herself needing to even the balance.</p><p>\u201cI want you to disrobe,\u201d she said. If he would not loose her restraints, at least she could force him to remove his clothes. They would be equal in nakedness, at least.</p><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d With a roguish grin, he unbuttoned his waistcoat and cast it aside, before making short work of his cuffs. In a matter of moments, he\u2019d gathered his shirt and pulled it over his head. Then he sat up to remove his boots, offering Bel a splendid view of his bare-chested form. She admired the lean, sculpted tone of his muscles; the masculine grace of his movements. She had to remind herself again that this paragon of male beauty was her husband</p><p>\u2014 hers.</p><p>His boots removed, Toby unfastened his trousers and smallclothes and slid them down over his hips. And then there he sat, gloriously naked and proud. He hadn\u2019t a tremor of selfconsciousness in his whole body, and Bel envied that strength and confidence almost as much as she desired to feel it, covering her. Inside her.</p> <p>\u201cAnd ...?\u201d he prompted. \u201cTell me what now.\u201d</p><p>Come make love to me. Join with me.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t say it, not yet. He still had her at his mercy, and she did not want to beg.</p><p>\u201cCome kiss me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d Cautiously, he stretched his naked body over hers. Tenderly, he touched her lips with his. Those lips that had so recently tasted every inch of her body, so that it was almost as though Bel were kissing herself. How curious. She did taste of apricots. They kissed slowly, and then deeply. And then quite urgently.</p><p>His arousal pulsed against her thigh, and her own body throbbed and ached for him.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want it,\u201d he whispered against her neck. \u201cGod, tell me soon, or I swear I shall die. I\u2019ve wanted you all day, every moment. So fiercely I thought I\u2019d explode with it. Say the words, Isabel. Let me in.\u201d</p><p>Bel felt a wide, giddy smile stretching her face. At last. He might have her bound by the wrists and panting with pleasure, but she had him naked and desperate and utterly tied in knots. And now, all the power was hers.</p> <p>She hooked one leg over his and ground against him in invitation.</p><p>\u201cIsabel,\u201d he groaned. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to say it,\u201d he demanded, in that curt, arousing voice.</p><p>She laughed. He lifted his head, and their eyes locked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said, giving him a coy smile.</p><p>His amber-flecked eyes warmed with understanding. \u201cYou tease,\u201d he accused, a grin spreading across his face. And then, taking her mouth, \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her passionately, moaning against her mouth as he lifted her hips and\u2014merciful heaven\u2014 finally slid into her.</p><p>Oh, it felt so perfect. So right.</p><p>Holding steady deep within her, he reached over her head to untie the cravat. Once her hands were free, they flew straight to him. He took her in strong, deep strokes, and she explored his body boldly with her fingers, caressing him in places she\u2019d never dared to touch before: the taut swell of his buttock, the downy slope of his thigh. She felt free now, free to possess all of him. Locking her ankles behind his back, she reached under them, to touch where their bodies joined\u2014his hard, thick shaft sliding in and out of her body, the soft, vulnerable sac beneath. He swore. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She squeezed gently, and he groaned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014God, I can\u2019t stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try.\u201d She raised both hands to his shoulders and clung to him tight. \u201cJust let go.\u201d</p><p>Grasping her hips, he took her hard and fast, driving her back toward the edge of that blissful nothingness.</p><p>And in that last moment of delicious tension before she cried out in release, Bel thought to herself\u2014if she never returned from it, she would not mind.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>The next morning, Bel knew she must have gone mad sometime during the night. Surely she must be seeing things.</p><p>Lambs.</p><p>Honestly, lambs. White, fluffy, innocent lambs frolicking on a sloping green. They even made adorable little bleating noises to one another.</p><p>As if Wynterhall weren\u2019t idyllic enough already\u2014as if Bel hadn\u2019t just spent the morning touring what was now her very own enchanted castle and made the acquaintance of a benevolent house staff surely taken from the pages of some fairy story\u2014now Toby had swept her out onto the terrace to see the well-tended gardens.</p><p>And greet the lambs.</p><p>Really. Even for her, this was a bit much. And it felt so incongruously innocent, after the torrid night of passion they\u2019d shared. She could scarcely look at Toby this morning without blushing.</p><p>\u201cAre they pets?\u201d she asked, as one of the bleating creatures nosed her skirts. \u201cSome sort of pastoral decoration, like park deer?\u201d</p><p>Toby chuckled. \u201cNo, they\u2019re a nuisance. We\u2019re overrun with the creatures. Our steward increased the flock last autumn\u2014with the new stocking factory down the river, wool is a good investment. And then it was a particularly fruitful spring for lambing, I gather. Now we\u2019re drowning in the things.\u201d</p><p>Together they walked across the green. The grass was still damp with the last touch of morning dew.</p><p>\u201cThey were meant to have the north fields for pasture,\u201d Toby continued. \u201cBut those plans met with a bit of a snag when the north fields flooded last month, and now... now, they\u2019re rather everywhere. It\u2019s positively biblical, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He tugged sharply on her hand. \u201cWatch your step, darling. Their leavings are everywhere, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Bel hopped, narrowly missing the offense to her slippers.</p><p>Toby gave her a sheepish grin. \u201cThis is rural life, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be concerned on my account. I grew up on a plantation. I spent my childhood tossing grain to the chickens and gathering eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? You were made to tend chickens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no one made me. I wanted to do it.\u201d Bel bit back a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to redistribute their eggs, depending on how well I liked the hens. My favorites, I tallied as good layers\u2014whether or not it was the truth. If one pecked my fingers, however, she would be ...\u201d Bel shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDinner.\u201d He gave her an exaggerated look of reproach. \u201cYou scheming thing, you. I tell you, my entire opinion of you has changed. I\u2019ll never look at you the same again.\u201d</p><p>Bel made a show of laughing, because she knew him to be in jest. She knew it in her mind, but still, some anxious twist of her belly argued otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWhat confessions you make,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall make you wait years to hear mine, until you are old and feeble and mostly deaf. Even then, I\u2019ll have to surround you with pillows in the event you fall over with shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d just as soon never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s probably best.\u201d They had crossed the green now and entered a wooded glen. Toby turned them onto a narrow, root-scored path. \u201cThis is the way to Yorke Manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would we wish to follow it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy, to visit Mr. Yorke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? But you\u2019re opponents.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t it be awkward for the two of them to meet, socially?</p><p>Bel would find it awkward, at any rate.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re opponents since yesterday. But we\u2019ve been friends for years, and neighbors since I was born. None of that is negated by the election.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course.\u201d Bel sighed. It hadn\u2019t been very gracious of her to object. She felt so on edge with Toby this morning, as though he would disapprove of her every remark. Perhaps it was the pressure of entering this grand estate as its mistress.</p><p>No, of course not. She knew her anxieties stemmed from their lovemaking yesterday. And last night. And very early this morning.</p><p>By all evidence, Toby had been well pleased with their use of the ancestral bed\u2014as had she\u2014</p><p>but Bel worried that he would regard her differently, now that she\u2019d been so bold with him. Had any of his respect for her survived the night?</p><p>\u201cDo you know, your little chickens tale started me thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really. Me, thinking.\u201d He gave her a self-effacing look. \u201cHard to credit, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it.\u201d Smiling, he took her hand in his. \u201cBut I was thinking, about what a supremely fortunate fellow I am. I get along with most everyone, Isabel. There are many people I like, many people I call friend\u2014but in all my life, I\u2019ve met few individuals I can honestly say I admire. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she answered carefully, worried about where she now fell in that divide. \u201cBut we each have a measure of goodness. Surely one can find something\u2014some act or personal quality\u2014to admire in any person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you can do so\u2014but you are better than me. No, I can count only a small number of my acquaintances that I deem worthy of unequivocal admiration. Can you guess who they might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d That was an easy guess. Isabel admired her mother-in-law, too, for her sharp wit and easy grace.</p><p>\u201cYes, for one. Mr. Yorke is another.\u201d He laughed a little. \u201cAnd if I ever wanted to start an interesting scene, I should gather them both in the same room and tell them so.\u201d With his free hand, he picked up a fallen branch and swung it idly, swatting at the bushes and vines as they went. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? If there are only a handful of people I can admire in the world, how lucky am I? I was born to one of them, grew up a stone\u2019s throw from another ...\u201d He brought her hand to his lips and kissed it. \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve managed to marry a third.\u201d</p><p>Bel\u2019s heart warmed. How did he do it? How did he always intuit just exactly what she needed to hear and then speak the words so convincingly? It was beyond charm, it was ... She didn\u2019t even know what to call it. \u201cToby, that\u2019s very ...\u201d Romantic? Generous? Undeserved? \u201c...</p><p>sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d He hurried forward a step, then swung around to face her, halting her progress. Suddenly, his tone wasn\u2019t teasing anymore\u2014simply husky and soft. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with being sweet. I\u2019m being honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t lie to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie to you?\u201d Pausing, he gave her a little smile. \u201cNever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And how could she doubt him, when he looked at her thus\u2014with those amber-flecked eyes warm with admiration, wide enough to reflect all her hopes and dreams?</p><p>\u201cI honestly meant what I told you yesterday,\u201d he told her, skipping his finger from the crown of her head, to her brow, to the tip of her nose, to her chin. \u201cI admire every part of you, inside and out. And I\u2019m ... I\u2019m simply so very grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrateful?\u201d she breathed. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the fact you\u2019re not wearing a bonnet this morning.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands and kissed her.</p><p>She almost laughed into his kiss, for in that moment Bel was grateful, too\u2014and for an equally absurd reason. Not because she\u2019d married a man who could turn her insides to jelly with a smile, or because he\u2019d made her mistress of her very own lovely, lamb-plagued castle. Not even because she trusted him so implicitly, so completely that she could accept not only kisses, but pleasure and praise from these lips.</p><p>No, in that moment she was overwhelmed with a most vain sort of gratitude\u2014for the fact that Toby was tall. Taller than she, when so many men weren\u2019t. She would always have to reach for his kiss\u2014stretch her neck, arch her feet\u2014and feel just a bit girlish and uncertain and excited as she did. This kiss would never lose its thrill.</p><p>A giddy bubble of infatuation rose in her belly. By sheer force of will, she tamped it down. She may have lost the struggle against desire, but she was doubly resolved to guard her heart. Desire would inevitably fade\u2014but love?</p><p>Love had a way of altering one\u2019s priorities. And Bel needed to keep hers intact. She pulled away, and he growled deep in his throat.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s enough of that,\u201d he said, planting one last firm kiss on her lips before releasing her. \u201cElse we\u2019ll never make it to Yorke\u2019s this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it we\u2019re going there at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a matter of estate concern. It\u2019s this business with the irrigation canal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Isabel remembered her mother-in-law\u2019s complaint. \u201cMr. Yorke went back on his agreement, simply to vex your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain there\u2019s more to it than that. Mother has a way of exaggerating when it comes to Yorke. You\u2019d think him the three-eyed ogre under the bridge, rather than the neighbor living across it.\u201d Their boots made hollow clunking noises as he led her over the graying planks that bridged a small rill. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind the walk,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d feel up to the carriage just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bel agreed, her pulse accelerating at the mere mention of yesterday\u2019s calamity. She\u2019d be just as happy never to ride in a carriage again.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I suppose I could have left you at home and allowed you to rest,\u201d he continued, winking at her. \u201cBut I\u2019m too selfish for that. This is our honeymoon, after all, and I mean to keep you close.\u201d</p><p>They edged a wheat field in silence, walking arm in arm, and Isabel tilted her face to the warm June sunshine. If God had ever created a more beautiful morning, Isabel would still prefer this one. She didn\u2019t think her heart could withstand a day that came any closer to perfection. If the breeze teasing the grain were just a degree warmer, if this sky were just a slightly deeper shade of blue ... if her husband, the handsomest thing under the sun, winked at her just one more time\u2014true disaster could strike.</p><p>She could fall in love.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem.\u201d</p><p>Toby frowned as Mr. Yorke tugged him closer to the garden hedge. Behind them, Isabel marveled over a clump of late-blooming strawberries, gathering the tiny red fruits in one palm. Imagine, the dear girl had never seen strawberry plants. There were so many things he could show her, so many delights she\u2019d never experienced.</p><p>\u201cWe have a serious problem,\u201d Yorke whispered again. \u201cThis little plan of yours is off to an inauspicious start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Toby asked.</p><p>\u201cLet me give you a hint. If you don\u2019t want the populace to support your candidacy, you shouldn\u2019t go performing dashing heroics in front of the crowd. You\u2019re the talk of the borough, after that little trick-riding stunt.\u201d</p> <p>Toby winced. He\u2019d imagined that wouldn\u2019t help his cause. \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t have done differently. Should I have simply stood back and waited for disaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Yorke looked over his shoulder at Isabel. \u201cAnd even I have to applaud you. It was well done, Toby. For a moment there, even I was certain you\u2019d break your neck. But you should know, much as it pains my pride to admit it\u2014now you may have to make a real effort to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a bit of excitement and chatter. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be completely absent from the hustings; I\u2019ll send no one to speak in my stead. You\u2019re still a sure bet for reelection, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But it is a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a problem?\u201d Isabel asked, surprising them both with her sudden nearness. She extended her hand to Toby. \u201cHave some strawberries?\u201d</p><p>He declined with a slight shake of his head. It was all the movement he could manage, what with his heart thudding against his ribs. Surely she hadn\u2019t heard them. She didn\u2019t have the look of a trusting newlywed bride who just discovered she\u2019d been betrayed by her husband, less than one week into her marriage.</p><p>Toby cleared his throat. \u201cWe\u2019re just discussing the irrigation canal. Mr. Yorke was about to tell me what his problem is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you suddenly refusing to proceed? I need that canal, Yorke. Ever since they built that factory downriver, the north fields are flooding every spring. Meanwhile, our lands to the west are under-watered. The canal remedies both conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but those are your problems. Not mine. Why should I allow you to dig a trench through my land, let alone share the costs of the labor to dig it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the canal will water your western fields, too. Hadn\u2019t you complained of the low yield last harvest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had,\u201d Yorke said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve since realized, it\u2019s not for lack of water. The land\u2019s merely overworked. I\u2019ve decided to let it lie fallow this season, and therefore, I\u2019ll reap no benefit from your canal. Neither do I have the extra income to pay for it. It\u2019ll have to wait until next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but the lambs!\u201d Isabel said. \u201cThink of the lambs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lambs?\u201d Yorke echoed.</p><p>\u201cYes, the lambs,\u201d Toby groaned. \u201cThey\u2019re overrunning Wynterhall. And they\u2019re reasonably compact and adorable now, but by next year they\u2019ll simply be sheep. Great, woolly, malodorous sheep. I need those north fields drained for pasture, this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo build the canal. Just keep it on your lands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know very well that would double the length and the cost. Come on, man. Be a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe a friend?\u201d Yorke gave a chortling laugh. \u201cWhat sort of negotiation is that? If you want your canal, you\u2019ll have to make it worth my while.\u201d</p><p>Toby narrowed his eyes at the old man. For the first time in his life, he was growing truly impatient with Yorke. \u201cCrafty old devil. You want this canal, too. You\u2019re just trying to get out of paying for it.\u201d</p><p>Yorke puffed his chest. \u201cNow you\u2019re starting to sound like that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave that woman\u2014\u201d Toby bit off that sentence and began again. \u201cLeave my mother out of this. We\u2019re the landholders, and this is between you and me. Now, if we can\u2019t begin work on that canal directly, I shall have to spend much more time in Surrey this summer. I may have to go talking with the farmers in the neighborhood. Perhaps even perform another display of horsemanship.\u201d</p><p>He stared hard at Yorke, letting the implications of his words sink in. The old man looked a bit shocked. Toby was a bit shocked, too, truth be told. He had no idea where it had come from, the gall to threaten his friend\u2019s seat in Parliament simply to see a trench dug in the dirt. But much as he appreciated Yorke\u2019s friendship over the years, he wasn\u2019t going to let the man take advantage of it.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, my boy,\u201d Yorke said in a low, warning tone. The old man\u2019s watery gaze flicked toward Isabel. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bluff you want me to call.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. He wouldn\u2019t dare. A knot formed in Toby\u2019s gut. Surely Yorke wouldn\u2019t betray their secret. If Isabel learned about their gentlemen\u2019s agreement to fix the election, she\u2019d never forgive him. He\u2019d spend the rest of his life sleeping with the sheep. Mr. Yorke smiled at Isabel. \u201cMay I, Lady Aldridge?\u201d he asked, plucking a strawberry from her palm.</p><p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d she replied, returning his smile. So sweet, so innocent. So completely unaware of what a deceitful cad she called husband.</p><p>\u201cA word to the wise, Toby,\u201d Yorke said, popping the strawberry into his mouth. \u201cNever gamble with something you\u2019re not prepared to lose.\u201d</p><p>Toby exhaled with frustration. He knew he was beaten. Yorke knew it too, damn his eyes. The old man could demand to plow a canal straight through Wynterhall\u2019s gardens, and now Toby would be forced to agree.</p><p>\u201cSurely some compromise can be reached.\u201d Isabel raised another strawberry to her juicestained lips. \u201cTake pity on the lambs, Mr. Yorke,\u201d she said, her eyes twinkling. \u201cDon\u2019t God\u2019s little lambs deserve a home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the newlywed love talking?\u201d Yorke directed his question at Toby. \u201cOr is she always like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m always like this,\u201d she said. \u201cAren\u2019t I, Toby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Toby smiled despite himself. Only Isabel could insult him so sweetly. She continued, \u201cI\u2019m not a romantic, Mr. Yorke. Fairness, justice, honesty\u2014these are the qualities that move my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Yorke gave Toby a chastening look.</p><p>Toby shrugged and studied the oak standing sentinel atop a distant hill. He imagined he saw his own noose hanging there, twisting in the breeze. Yes, old man. There you have it. I\u2019m sunk.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Yorke said gruffly. \u201cIn the interests of fairness, we\u2019ll proceed with the canal as agreed, if\u201d \u2014he stayed Isabel\u2019s thanks with a curt gesture\u2014\u201cif you lease my western fields for the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just said you plan to let them lie fallow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. You can use them as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs pasture,\u201d Toby said, shaking his head as the obvious dawned. \u201cOf course. And the land will be the richer for it, in time for winter planting.\u201d He had to hand it to Yorke; the man really was shrewd. No wonder he\u2019d been so successful in Parliament all these years. What mad whim had led Toby to consider making a serious challenge? \u201cThis was your plan all along, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Yorke said, slapping him on the back. \u201cReally, Toby. You were supposed to be clever enough to think of it yourself. It\u2019s a fortunate thing you married this one,\u201d he said, nodding at Isabel. \u201cAt least she knows God\u2019s little lambs need a home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>A primal scream greeted them as Toby and Isabel crossed the threshold of Grayson House.</p><p>\u201cDear heavens.\u201d Isabel clutched at his arm, drawing her body into his. Her instinctive response gave Toby a deeply male sense of satisfaction. His wife trusted him. To protect her, to pleasure her. Surely it could not be long before she surrendered her heart. When this absurd election was over, Isabel would put aside her disappointment, and Toby had every hope that their relationship could continue to deepen and grow. In short, life was good. A savage growl shook the walls.</p><p>Or not so good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophia rushed toward them, her cheeks flushed and hair in disarray. \u201cThank God you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil is going on?\u201d Toby handed his hat and gloves to a footman. \u201cAre they murdering cats above-stairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lucy,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cShe\u2019s gone into labor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere?\u201d Isabel asked. A moan rumbled through the plastered ceiling, and she tilted her head toward its source. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sophia ushered them toward the salon, drawing them aside for a private conference just before they entered. She lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cShe and Jeremy had some kind of row, and Lucy left in a fit of temper. She drove here in the phaeton, and by the time she arrived her pains had already begun. Miss Osborne says it\u2019s not safe to move her. She must deliver the child here.\u201d</p><p>Toby exchanged a quick glance with his wife. \u201cWe really should leave.\u201d</p><p>Isabel nodded. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d When another muffled cry floated down the corridor, she turned to Sophia. \u201cWe\u2019ll come for the Society leaflet another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sophia reached for them, grasping Toby\u2019s arm in one hand and Isabel\u2019s wrist in the other. \u201cDon\u2019t leave, I beg you.\u201d</p> <p>Toby said, \u201cSurely Miss Osborne has matters in hand. Or would you like me to summon another physician?\u201d</p><p>Sophia shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not Lucy I\u2019m concerned for. Hetta says her labor is progressing well, if a bit slowly. That\u2019s normal with first babes, she says. No, it\u2019s Jeremy who needs looking after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJem?\u201d Toby flicked a glance toward the salon. \u201cHe\u2019s already here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Gray and Joss are there with him, but I think he\u2019d be glad for the company of a friend. He\u2019s not taking this well, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>A long, piercing scream interrupted their conversation. All eyes rolled ceiling-ward.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toby said finally, staring at the stamped plaster. \u201cI can imagine Jem wouldn\u2019t be taking this well at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you say Joss is with them?\u201d Isabel asked. Sophia nodded, and a speaking glance passed between the ladies. \u201cOh, dear. This must be torture for him.\u201d</p><p>Toby thought it rather sounded like Lucy was the one being tortured. He himself wasn\u2019t overly concerned, seeing as how his three sisters had survived ten noisy births, collectively, and he knew Lucy to be hardier than any of them.</p><p>But then\u2014he took the briefest moment to imagine these were Isabel\u2019s cries of pain. He immediately shared Jeremy\u2019s unease. Now each small moan and whimper had him wincing like a kick to the gut. How much worse for Joss, who had lost a wife in childbirth?</p><p>Sophia squeezed his arm. \u201cPlease, just sit with them.\u201d Imploring him with watery blue eyes, she tilted her head toward the salon. \u201cTry to convince Jeremy that all will be well. Keep his mind occupied with other things. Just... Toby, just be yourself. More than anyone I know, you have a gift for putting people at ease.\u201d</p><p>Words failed him for a moment. Of all the people he hadn\u2019t expected to hear praising his character, the woman who\u2019d run away rather than marry him was at the top of the list. At length, he gave a mute nod of assent.</p><p>Releasing his arm, Sophia turned to his wife. \u201cBel, would you come upstairs and help me? I\u2019m gathering fresh linens and supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, certainly.\u201d</p><p>Toby watched them disappear up the stairs, hand in hand. Remarkable. He wished now were the time to really talk to Sophia. To ask her why\u2014if he put everyone so at ease\u2014she\u2019d fled halfway across the world rather than speak to him about ending their engagement. But now wasn\u2019t the time. At the moment, he had a friend in need.</p> <p>Mustering all the blithe, irreverent charm he could find, Toby donned a carefree smile and sauntered into the salon. \u201cGood afternoon. Gray, Joss ... Jem. No, don\u2019t get up.\u201d He crossed to the bar and began pouring himself a brandy. After filling his own glass, he took the decanter over to Jeremy and topped off his friend\u2019s drink, noting the pale, drawn mask of worry on his face. \u201cWell, Jem,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cI understand congratulations are in order.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy stared into his glass. \u201cPrayers are in order. This shouldn\u2019t be happening. It\u2019s too soon. And it\u2019s all my fault. We argued, and ...\u201d He scrubbed his face with one hand, leaving his eyes heavy and laced with red. \u201cI should send an express to Waltham Manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me do it,\u201d Gray said, sitting down to a writing desk. \u201cShe\u2019s at my house, after all. Shall I address it to her father or her mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo her brother, Henry. Lucy hasn\u2019t any parents living.\u201d When another growling moan sounded from above, Jeremy dropped his head in his hands. \u201cOh, God. I can\u2019t endure this.\u201d</p><p>Toby sat down next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly normal, Jem. All my sisters sounded the same in labor, or worse. And babies arrive in their own time\u2014a few weeks early, a few weeks late. Everything comes out fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept when it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Joss rose from his chair and strode to the window. Toby glared at him, and Joss stared back with hollow eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Joss.\u201d Gray gave his brother a warning look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d Joss asked defensively. \u201cDon\u2019t prepare a man for all possibilities? There\u2019s no benefit in denying the truth. We all know women die in childbirth. It happens.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy groaned into his hands.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Toby said in a matter-of-fact tone, \u201cit happens.\u201d He refused to let his annoyance with Joss taint his efforts at reassurance. \u201cBut this is not some random woman we\u2019re discussing.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his voice, he spoke to Jeremy. \u201cThey don\u2019t know Lucy like we do, Jem. Listen to me. I\u2019ve a mother and three older sisters, all of whom eat adversity for breakfast. I\u2019m married to the most principled lady on earth. But when it comes to strength of will, Lucy bests them all. She\u2019s healthy, she\u2019s young, and she\u2019s determined to give you a beautiful child. And when Lucy\u2019s determined to do something, she does it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy!\u201d Lucy\u2019s pained cry clawed through the ceiling. \u201cIf you hear me down there, I want you to know ... You are never. Coming near me. Again.\u201d</p><p>Toby and Jeremy looked at one another.</p><p>The voice became more of a growl. \u201cNever. Ever. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d Toby remarked at length. \u201cThat\u2019s determination for you.\u201d</p><p>When Jeremy made no response, Toby decided it was time to speak of other things. Diversion, that\u2019s what this group needed. \u201cHow are the legal studies progressing, Joss?\u201d</p><p>Joss stared out the window. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Several moments\u2019 silence followed. Well, so much for that vein of conversation.</p><p>\u201cI met with Felix in the park the other day,\u201d Toby began again. \u201cJem, really\u2014one of us needs to ward him off whenever he mentions Tattersalls. Or accompany him, at the least. He laid down an outrageous sum for a team of bays last week, more than double their worth. They\u2019re not evenly matched at all, and his carriage pulled left so egregiously, I found him spinning in circles in the midst of Rotten Row.\u201d Toby chuckled. \u201cNot that driving has ever been Felix\u2019s forte. He really ought to leave it to coachmen, instead of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d Lifting his head from his hands, Jeremy gave him that insufferable autocratic Look. There really was no disobeying that Look. He would make a formidable father, indeed.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it.\u201d</p><p>Toby raised his eyebrows. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy lowered his head again, and quiet reigned. Gray sipped his drink. Joss stared out the window. Toby tugged at his neck cloth. The midsummer heat choked the room, oppressive and mute.</p><p>A scream tore through the tense silence.</p><p>Every man froze.</p><p>\u201cToby,\u201d Jeremy said, his fingers white-knuckled webs against his black hair.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking.\u201d</p><p>So he did. For hours. Afternoon faded toward evening, brandy dwindled in its decanter, and coats and cravats peeled away from restless, perspiring men. Through it all, Toby kept talking. He talked of foxhounds and boxing and every inane, meaningless topic he could dredge from his imagination. Mundane, everyday concerns that he hoped would serve as a reminder that beyond this day, beyond Lucy\u2019s labor, mundane, everyday life would continue. As the sinking sun painted the salon carpet in shades of plum and crimson, Toby was just embarking on a detailed description of the new writing desk he\u2019d ordered for his study. By this point, he was growing hoarse, and boring even himself. But until Jeremy told him to stop, he was going to keep talking. \u201cI ordered dark-blue felt to line the drawers,\u201d he said, yawning.</p><p>\u201cAnd the handles are carved in the shape of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Miss Osborne saved them all, thank God, when she flung open the salon doors. Jeremy shot to his feet. Toby, Gray, and Joss followed suit, with lumbering movements.</p><p>\u201cNo babe yet,\u201d Miss Osborne said.</p><p>Four chests deflated in unison. Jeremy sank back into his chair with a muttered oath. \u201cOh, God. She\u2019s going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not going to die,\u201d Miss Osborne said firmly. \u201cThere is no cause for concern. Everything is progressing as it should. First labors are always lengthy, and Lucy is weathering the pains well. I expect it will be a few hours more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see her?\u201d Jeremy asked.</p><p>She paused. \u201cNo, my lord.\u201d</p><p>At the words \u201cmy lord,\u201d Jeremy seemed to recall his position of authority. Toby watched the decision to pull rank travel up his face, starting with the firming of his jaw and ending with his ice-blue eyes and heavy brow as they flexed the Look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see her,\u201d he said, standing again and drawing to his full height.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Toby had to salute Miss Osborne. There weren\u2019t many women\u2014there weren\u2019t many people\u2014</p><p>who would have stood their ground against Jeremy in full Earl-of-Kendall arrogance.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep him away from her,\u201d Joss objected. \u201cShe\u2019s his wife.\u201d</p><p>Gray joined the effort to argue Jeremy\u2019s case. \u201cMiss Osborne, surely you can permit him a few minutes with Lucy.\u201d</p><p>The young woman shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of me granting my permission, it\u2019s a matter of Lucy granting hers.\u201d Her sharp gaze landed on Jeremy. \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t want to see you, my lord. She expressly told me so, and I will heed my patient\u2019s wishes above even the demands of an earl.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy swore again.</p><p>When Joss echoed him, Miss Osborne threw him a strange look.</p><p>\u201cI came to inform you of Lucy\u2019s condition,\u201d she continued. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve done so, I must return upstairs.\u201d</p><p>She turned to leave, but Jeremy darted forward to catch her arm.</p><p>\u201cHetta, please.\u201d His voice cracked. Toby thought he had never seen his friend look so vulnerable. \u201cI know Lucy\u2019s angry with me. We did not part well earlier. But you must let me see her, give me a chance to put things right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will have a chance, my lord. After the babe is born, but not before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to keep me from her?\u201d Jeremy loomed over the young woman. Her face blanched, throwing her freckles into sharp relief. \u201cIf I decide to see my wife, ten men couldn\u2019t keep me from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJem.\u201d Toby stepped between them, placing a hand on Jeremy\u2019s shoulder and guiding his friend back with a light yet firm touch. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult, but you must respect Lucy\u2019s wishes. As Miss Osborne says, you\u2019ll have ample time to make up later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to your friend, my lord.\u201d With that, Miss Osborne dropped a perfunctory curtsy and left the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frustrated, impotent silence resumed. Jeremy paced the carpet. Gray moved to uncork a fresh bottle of liquor. With a vicious oath, Joss quit the room. The door slammed shut behind him. Toby supposed he ought to start prattling again, provide more distraction. But he didn\u2019t really feel like talking. What he felt like doing was charging upstairs, finding Isabel, gathering her into his arms and burying his face in her sweet-scented hair. He didn\u2019t want to kiss her, or lie with her, or even speak to her. He just wanted to be near her. Desperately. The yearning hit him like a fist, leaving a dull ache in his chest. And with it came a realization that left him without words.</p><p>He was deeply, irretrievably in love with his wife.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p> <p>Miss Osborne froze on the first riser of the staircase, hand on the banister. She didn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>\u201cIf a man wants to see his wife, who are you to stop him?\u201d Joss demanded, stepping closer. Staring into the fine wisps of auburn hair where they curled against her pale neck. So delicate and soft. So completely unlike her.</p><p>\u201cIf a woman does not wish to see her husband,\u201d she said calmly, pivoting to face him, \u201cwho am I to force her?\u201d Miss Osborne was a small woman, but with the benefit of one step\u2019s height, she stood nearly eye-to-eye with him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what it does to a man, listening to his wife in such agony, knowing he is powerless to help her? Knowing she could die? It is the most acute form of torture imaginable. Any devoted husband would swallow hot coals to spare his wife a moment\u2019s suffering.\u201d He jabbed a finger toward the closed salon door. \u201cThat man is sick with worry, and your heartless remarks only multiply his distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Lord Kendall is sick with anything, it\u2019s guilt. He regrets their argument, and well he should, from Lucy\u2019s report of it. But his apologies will have to wait. I\u2019m here to deliver an infant, not coddle a grown man\u2019s conscience.\u201d</p> <p>Her impersonal tone only added fuel to Joss\u2019s anger. It was clear from her prim carriage, the proud jut of her chin\u2014she meant to deny his presence had any effect on her. But he knew it did.</p><p>He stepped closer, knowing she would not back down. Though she stood perfectly still, her pupils widened a fraction, and her auburn lashes quivered as she blinked. Good. He wanted to unsettle her. He wanted to crack open the ice encasing this woman and discover the warm, beating heart that instinct told him must lie somewhere within. \u201cMiss Osborne,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cHetta. Can you truly be so cold, so devoid of sympathy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cold, I\u2019m competent. I\u2019m a physician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA physician treats people, not merely injuries and illnesses. You would be a better doctor if you gave some consideration to your patients\u2019 feelings. And you would be a better person if you allowed yourself to feel.\u201d</p><p>She laughed bitterly. \u201cYou would encourage me to feel. Of course\u2014by your accounting, one cannot claim true suffering without a proportional measure of public grief. Not all of us have the luxury of indulging our emotions, Captain Grayson. Don\u2019t you know Lucy is my dearest friend? I do not enjoy watching her in pain, any more than Lord Kendall does. Should I come join you gentlemen, then? Spend the evening cursing into my brandy? Perhaps that would give you sufficient proof of my sympathy, but it would not help Lucy deliver her child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiss Osborne, you\u2019re the most educated woman I know. Surely you\u2019re more clever than that argument implies.\u201d Joss inhaled slowly, tempering his frustration. Why did this woman affect him so? Every time he was in her presence, he felt compelled to defend his behavior, explain himself in ways he shouldn\u2019t need to explain himself to anyone. He didn\u2019t know why it should matter what she thought of him, but somehow it did. It mattered a great deal. \u201cYou needn\u2019t choose between the two,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t you be both a physician and a human? Both Lady Kendall\u2019s doctor and her friend?\u201d</p><p>She stood silent for a long moment. Joss waited for her to speak.</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d she began at last, \u201cwas ill, bed ridden for more than a year. My father personally saw to her treatment. He consulted specialists, spent long nights scouring medical journals for new treatments. Not once\u2014not even toward the end, when she forgot our names\u2014did my father indulge in a moment\u2019s self-pity. Not once did he allow her to see his distress. And the day she died, did he sit by her bedside and weep useless tears, just to prove his love for her?</p><p>No, he went to tend victims of a mining explosion the next county over. Because he was the doctor, and they needed his help.\u201d The sparks of green flashed in her hazel eyes. \u201cEveryone has wounds, Captain Grayson. Some of us do our bleeding on the inside.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she raised a hand to her temple and closed her eyes. Her posture softened, and Joss finally glimpsed what he\u2019d been waiting to see since the day of their introduction. At that moment, she wasn\u2019t a doctor. She wasn\u2019t efficient or headstrong or abrasive or cold. She was simply a woman\u2014and an exhausted one, at that. The long hours of work weighed heavy on her shoulders. Eyes still shut, she swayed slightly on her feet. She desperately needed a rest. More than that, she needed to be held.</p><p>He could hold her. He had two strong arms, and her slender frame would fit quite neatly in their circumference. On another day, she might be strong enough to hold him in return. But it couldn\u2019t be that easy. Nothing was ever that easy. There were questions and enmity and ghosts between them. And Joss knew from experience that taking a woman in his arms was a great deal simpler than letting her go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He rested a hand on the banister, sliding it slowly higher until it rested an inch from hers. \u201cI realize this day has been a trial for you as well. It\u2019s just that I know what a living hell it is to be in Lord Kendall\u2019s place. In many ways, his misery is my own. If you cannot have a care for his feelings, perhaps you could have a care for mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would ask me to care,\u201d she said, eyes still shut. \u201cCare for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, damn it. Do I not deserve as much? Am I not just as human as Lord Kendall, as any man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord. You are just as much a fool, as any man.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened and looked to his. There was something there. Not the respect he\u2019d been seeking, but something better and worse at once. Emotion, raw and intense. She did care for his feelings. She cared a great deal. Good Lord, the girl was half in love with him, the devil knew why. For weeks now, he\u2019d been searching for her weakness, and the truth had been staring him in the mirror all the while. He was her weakness. And now that they both knew it, she trembled.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said softly. \u201cForgive me. I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><p>She made a choked sound, rather like a swallowed sob.</p><p>Some tender, protective impulse uncoiled in his heart. Leaning forward, he slid his hand along the banister until his thumb rested in the crook of hers. A warm pulse fluttered there, where her skin was chafed and cracked from frequent scrubbing. He soothed the spot with his thumb, at every moment expecting her to pull away. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cCould you, Hetta?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cCould you care for me?\u201d He hadn\u2019t known, until that moment, how much he\u2019d been wanting to ask her exactly that. Neither had he realized how much of his rudeness had been aimed at avoiding the answer.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Grayson ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoss,\u201d he corrected, raising his other hand to cradle her smooth, flushed cheek. Closing her eyes, she leaned ever so slightly into his palm. \u201cMy name is Joss.\u201d</p><p>Then a low moan sounded above them. Hetta bristled away from his touch. Joss dropped his hand from her face, but he kept the other twined with hers. They stared into one another\u2019s eyes for a few seconds more, and in that remarkable shade of hazel, Joss read possibilities and questions and fears. And then\u2014he saw the moment of her decision.</p><p>He released her before she could pull away.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t care for you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGrief, bitterness ... those are wounds I don\u2019t know how to cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHetta, wait. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have work to do.\u201d Crossing her arms, she retreated up the staircase. \u201cGo back to your brandy and be at ease. No one is going to die here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to murder him.\u201d</p><p>Bel exchanged a worried glance with Sophia. Her sister-in-law stood at the other side of the bed, fanning Lucy industriously. For her part, Bel placed a fresh damp cloth against Lucy\u2019s brow.</p><p>Their efforts did nothing to cool the laboring woman\u2019s temper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to murder Jeremy for doing this to me,\u201d Lucy said, panting for breath between contractions. \u201cDoes he know how much this hurts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been making enough noise to give him a fair idea.\u201d Miss Osborne swept back into the room, bearing an armload of towels in one hand and dabbing at her eyes with the other.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Lucy growled, curling in on herself. Her face contorted in pain as another spasm gripped her.</p><p>Bel noted Sophia\u2019s bleached countenance. She\u2019d probably never witnessed a woman in the worst pains of labor. Bel herself was no midwife, but she\u2019d been present at a handful of births</p><p>\u2014most notably, and most tragically, that of her nephew, Jacob.</p><p>She knew enough to realize something was wrong.</p><p>Skirting the edge of the bed, she approached Hetta at the washstand.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Lord Kendall?\u201d Bel murmured, making a show of folding and refolding the towels as Hetta scrubbed her hands with the cake of soap.</p><p>\u201cNo. What purpose would it serve? He\u2019s already worried sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to tell Lucy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s no benefit in distressing her.\u201d Hetta flicked a glance over her shoulder at Sophia.</p><p>\u201cAnd your sister-in-law looks ready to faint as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just anxious for her friend, and for herself. It will be her turn, come the winter. Right now, she is imagining herself enduring the same ordeal. Perhaps you could explain to her, afterward ... why it is likely to go easier for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it might not.\u201d Hetta rinsed her hands, and Bel offered her a towel. \u201cOne never knows. I can\u2019t make your sister any promises. A physician never makes promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have attended births like this before? Where the babe is turned backward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, several. Most of them with perfectly healthy outcomes for both mother and infant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost.\u201d Bel\u2019s stomach knotted. \u201cBut not all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not all.\u201d Hetta turned to her and looked her square in the eye. \u201cLucy and her child will be fine. I\u2019ve made a promise, and I mean to keep it. No one is going to die here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you just said a physician doesn\u2019t make promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Wilting against the washstand, Hetta put a wrist to her brow. \u201cA physician doesn\u2019t. That promise was made by a stupid, fanciful girl.\u201d Shrugging back into her mantle of brisk professionalism, she added, \u201cBut the physician means to keep it.\u201d</p><p>Hetta returned to her position at the foot of the bed, lifting the bedsheets to examine Lucy\u2019s progress. Bel returned to Lucy\u2019s side, replacing the warmed cloth on her forehead with yet another, freshly doused. There was little she could do, except make Lucy as comfortable as possible. And pray.</p><p>Silently, she resumed the litany she\u2019d been reciting all afternoon. Now she expanded her petitions, applying not just to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but to the Virgin Mary, too. Normally, Bel avoided anything that smacked of papist beliefs. She avoided following her mother\u2019s example in general\u2014be the passions holy or profane. But sometimes it comforted her, to put faith in a divine mother. One who embodied all the serenity and grace her own had lacked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God knew, the women in this room could stand to borrow some grace and serenity. Another scream forced its way through Lucy\u2019s gritted teeth.</p><p>Sophia looked as though she would be ill. Typically Bel envied her sister-in-law\u2019s elegant selfpossession. At times, she\u2019d even resented her for it and longed to see Sophia\u2014just once\u2014the tiniest bit ill at ease. But watching her come unraveled like this... it brought none of the satisfaction Bel had imagined. And finding herself the voice of composure between them, well</p><p>\u2014that rather flipped her world on its ear.</p> <p>When the contraction subsided, Hetta pushed the bedsheets to Lucy\u2019s waist. \u201cLucy, listen to me. The hard work is about to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo start?\u201d Lucy shouted. \u201cWhat the devil do you mean, to start? I know you did not just tell me, after I\u2019ve been laboring in this bed for six hours, that we are just about to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are going to start to push. It\u2019s time to deliver your child. With the next pains, I want you to grasp your knees and bear down.\u201d</p><p>Following Hetta\u2019s instructions, Bel and Sophia helped raise Lucy to a half-sitting position. They all stood frozen, waiting, until Lucy\u2019s low growl began again.</p><p>\u201cAll right now,\u201d Hetta directed. \u201cPush.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy pushed. And she pushed Bel\u2019s ear drums together, with the splitting scream that accompanied her effort.</p><p>\u201cNo more screaming,\u201d Hetta said, once the pains had passed and Lucy sagged limp in Bel and Sophia\u2019s arms. \u201cEvery scream is effort wasted. You need to save your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will this take?\u201d Sophia asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cImpossible to tell,\u201d Hetta answered her. \u201cHours, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Lucy moaned. \u201cHours? I can\u2019t do this for hours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d Bel told her.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d Lucy said hysterically. \u201cI really can\u2019t. I\u2019ve changed my mind. Go tell Jeremy I\u2019ve changed my mind. It\u2019s all his fault this child won\u2019t come out. What was I thinking, marrying a great, stubborn brute? I should have married the vicar\u2019s son. He\u2019d have given me runtish, compliant babies. Babies that wouldn\u2019t take hours to\u2014\u201d Her rant gave way to another pained cry.</p><p>\u201cPush, Lucy,\u201d Hetta ordered. \u201cPush as hard as you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d Lucy panted, once the contraction had ebbed, \u201cit will be you in labor, Hetta, and I\u2019m going to stand by the bedside and repay you tenfold for all this heartless tyranny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be welcome to do so, Lucy, should that day ever come.\u201d</p><p>For an instant, pain shimmered in Hetta\u2019s eyes. She quickly blinked it away, but not before Bel saw it. Saw it, and felt it twisting in her heart. While the three of them fell to pieces, this one woman was holding them all together\u2014and she was doing it all on her own. Alone. At the end of this day, Hetta was the only one of them who would not know the comforting embrace of a husband.</p><p>Bel closed her eyes. Behind her eyelids floated the image of Toby\u2019s reassuring smile. On the heels of reassurance, however, trod confusion. Somewhere in the past hour, she\u2019d stopped pleading with deities and started picturing her husband. Where were her priorities?</p><p>Her eyes flew open when someone clutched at her shoulder.</p><p>It was Sophia, reaching across from Lucy\u2019s other side. Her eyes were wide, and she trembled. She mouthed, \u201cI want to leave.\u201d</p> <p>Bel shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d Sophia whispered.</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d said Lucy, through clenched teeth. \u201cIf I have to stay, so do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy, you\u2019re doing beautifully,\u201d Bel said, smoothing the damp hair from Lucy\u2019s brow. \u201cJust think, soon you\u2019ll be holding your baby. It won\u2019t be much longer now. It can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>But it was.</p><p>After more than an hour of pushing, Lucy was pale and soaked with perspiration. \u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d she moaned through cracked lips.</p><p>\u201cHere, take a bit of tea.\u201d Bel raised the cup to her lips.</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Lucy shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want tea. I want this to stop. I want out. I can\u2019t do this, really I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then,\u201d Hetta said, stepping back. \u201cPerhaps you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sophia cried. \u201cBut how will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t mean that,\u201d Bel soothed. \u201cLucy\u2019s doing beautifully.\u201d Meanwhile, panic fluttered in her stomach. If even Hetta was losing confidence, they were really in trouble. They all watched as Hetta untied the apron from around her waist and went to rinse her hands at the washstand. Then she made for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Lucy demanded, craning her neck to see her friend. Hetta stopped at the door. \u201cI\u2019m going downstairs, to tell Lord Kendall you can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I go with you?\u201d Sophia asked, ignoring Bel\u2019s attempts to shush her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Jeremy going to do about it?\u201d Lucy asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though he can come up here and birth the child hims\u2014aah!\u201d She curled around another contraction. Bel supported Lucy\u2019s shoulders as she pushed, murmuring words of encouragement in her ear.</p><p>\u201cNo, he can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Hetta said, speaking over Lucy\u2019s cries of pain. \u201cBut perhaps he\u2019d like to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye?\u201d Bel and Sophia exclaimed in unison. If Lucy could have spoken through her pains, Bel was sure she would have made their duet a trio.</p><p>Arms crossed over her chest, Hetta strode back to the bedside. \u201cLucy, listen to me. Your child is breech. The chances of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bel grabbed Hetta\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t. Please.\u201d They couldn\u2019t give up hope, not yet. There were still a few saints she hadn\u2019t petitioned.</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Hetta murmured. \u201cI know Lucy.\u201d</p><p>The contraction over, Lucy flopped back against the pillows and glared up at her friend with flashing green eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare. I\u2019ve no intention of saying good-bye to Jeremy. I\u2019m still too vexed with him over this morning.\u201d</p><p>Hetta sat on the edge of the bed and took Lucy\u2019s hand. \u201cThen listen to me. The babe is breech, not headfirst as it should be. That\u2019s the reason you\u2019re having such difficulty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d Lucy blew a wisp of hair from her mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s an incorrigible brat already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Clearly he takes after his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I going to die? Tell me honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I would never lie. There is danger, for both you and the child. But when has a bit of danger prevented you from doing anything?\u201d Hetta squeezed Lucy\u2019s hand. \u201cLucy, you\u2019re the most stubborn, foolhardy woman I know. Your friends love you despite it. Your husband loves you for it. Lord Kendall believes you can do anything. Don\u2019t make me go down there and tell him otherwise. Don\u2019t let him suspect you\u2019ve given up, or you know as well as I, you\u2019ll never know the end of it. If he\u2019s overprotective now ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d Lucy\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re a cold woman, Hetta Osborne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll place more restrictions on you than ever,\u201d Hetta threatened. \u201cHe\u2019ll treat you like a plate of glass. He\u2019ll be so afraid of getting you with child, he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever touch me again?\u201d Lucy scoffed. \u201cNot likely. If he were that strong-willed, we\u2019d have never married in the first place.\u201d She sighed up at the ceiling. \u201cBut he might hold out for a year, or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Hetta replied. \u201cLucy, you can do this. If you concentrate and work hard, and most difficult of all, follow directions, both you and your baby will survive. But if I go down to Lord Kendall right now, your pride will never recover.\u201d</p><p>Lucy closed her eyes and lay still, breathing steadily in and out through her nose. Her dry, pale lips thinned to a line, then curled into a grimace.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Lucy,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cWe\u2019re all here to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help me,\u201d Lucy bit out. \u201cNo one can.\u201d</p><p>Hetta released her hand. \u201cVery well, then. I\u2019m going downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body.\u201d Lucy struggled to her elbows and gritted her teeth. \u201cNo one can help me, but I\u2019ll do it myself. I\u2019m going to push this baby out, if it kills me.\u201d</p><p>The supper trays went untouched. As the evening wore on, Lucy\u2019s cries grew louder. And then fainter. The poor girl must be exhausted, Toby reckoned. He certainly was, and he hadn\u2019t done a damn thing beyond sitting in this salon all day, talking himself into a stupor and watching his best friend in agony. He envied Isabel her manual tasks. Why couldn\u2019t he have been put to work boiling linens?</p><p>Gray apparently shared his feelings. He prowled the room like a caged animal. \u201cGod. How much longer can this go on? I can\u2019t take much more of this.\u201d</p><p>Still holding down the same armchair he\u2019d occupied all evening, Jeremy raised his head. \u201cYou think it\u2019s difficult for you? Imagine how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he is imagining it,\u201d Toby said to Jeremy. \u201cThat\u2019s precisely why he\u2019s so agitated. It\u2019ll be his turn soon enough.\u201d He raised his head and called to Gray. \u201cWhen\u2019s Sophia expecting? Late November, I\u2019d guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecember.\u201d Gray stared at him. \u201cHow did you know? Unless... Surely she didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Toby said. \u201cI\u2019ve three older sisters, with ten nieces and nephews between them. I can just tell. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we please speak of something besides breeding?\u201d Joss asked, propping his boots up on the side table. He leveled a gaze at Toby. \u201cSurely there is some topic left untouched in that prodigious lexicon of yours. Think of it as practice for your career in Parliament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a topic. Let\u2019s hear about the campaign,\u201d Gray said. \u201cHow is it progressing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... progressing.\u201d Toby shifted in his chair.</p><p>\u201cLast I heard, the polls were running dead even between you and Yorke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. But most of the electors have yet to cast their votes. They\u2019re waiting, I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Joss asked.</p><p>\u201cFor bribes.\u201d Gray flicked a glance at Toby. \u201cThey want to see which candidate will pay the highest price. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Toby scratched his neck. \u201cPerhaps. But they\u2019ll wait in vain. Mr. Yorke is unlikely to engage in bribery, and you know as well as I how Isabel would react to the idea of my buying votes.\u201d</p><p>Gray and Joss chuckled.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Toby said.</p><p>Some topic of shipping or tariffs took the Grayson brothers on a separate branch of conversation.</p><p>Jeremy rose from his chair and went to the window. Toby followed him. Lowering his voice, he said, \u201cCan I ask your advice on something, Jem?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy grunted in assent.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the House of Lords, obviously,\u201d Toby continued. \u201cTell me, with regards to this election ... what do you think is the surest way to lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo lose? Don\u2019t you want to win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not especially. I mean, Yorke\u2019s served our borough for years. Parliament is his life. Doesn\u2019t seem right to take that away from him. The man\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you running in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I promised Isabel, before we were married.\u201d Toby sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s got this idea that if I\u2019m an MP, she\u2019ll have more influence in society.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jeremy gave a half shrug. \u201cShe likely will. And from what I hear, Yorke\u2019s influence is waning. He\u2019s ready to retire. Seems like a beneficial arrangement all around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for everyone but me.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy gave him a questioning look.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it, Jem. I don\u2019t want to be an MP. I know, it sounds disgustingly self-serving. It\u2019s just...\u201d Toby ran a hand through his hair. \u201cIt seems like running for Parliament is something I ought to be doing for my own reasons, you know? Because I want to do it. Not just because it\u2019s what Isabel wants me to do.\u201d</p><p>This was all coming out wrong. Toby honestly did yearn to find some goal, some larger purpose to his life beyond tending an estate that hardly needed tending and waltzing girls onto verandahs. He realized now, watching Isabel\u2019s principles in action, he\u2019d been craving just that for years. But, selfishly enough, Toby wanted to find that purpose or goal for himself\u2014not be handed it by someone else. Not even her.</p><p>\u201cMy Lord. Can you hear yourself?\u201d More ungodly noises filtered down from upstairs, and Jeremy winced. His eyes rolled toward the ceiling. \u201cSomeday that\u2019s going to be your wife up there, screaming. Going through hell just to bring your child into the world. At this moment, there is nothing\u2014 nothing\u2014I would not give for Lucy, up to and including my own life. And here you\u2019re complaining about the prospect of sitting through a few boring committee meetings and assuming your long-shirked duty as a gentleman of privilege. You want me to advise you how to lose.\u201d</p><p>Toby cringed. Well, when he put it that way ... For a plan that was supposed to keep everyone happy, this election scheme was making him feel a downright cad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how to lose,\u201d Jeremy continued, his voice a raw whisper. \u201cStart an argument with your very pregnant wife. Shout hateful, unforgivable things at her. Send her tearing off in a fury so she\u2019ll go into labor a month too soon. Endanger her health and the life of your unborn child. Make her so bloody angry with you that she won\u2019t even allow you at her bedside while she\u2019s suffering. That is how to lose ... everything.\u201d</p> <p>Toby hurt for his friend. He knew Jeremy was prone to bouts of dark humor, but this was extreme pessimism, even for him.</p><p>\u201cJem.\u201d He leaned closer, forcing Jeremy to meet his eyes. Keeping his voice firm and level, he said, \u201cLucy\u2019s going to be fine, and the babe as well. You\u2019ll see. Whatever row the two of you had, it will all be forgiven when you\u2019re cooing over your newborn child.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy shook his head. \u201cHow can she forgive me? I will never forgive myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, precisely? I can\u2019t imagine any argument so horrible as you\u2019re implying.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy blew out a slow breath. \u201cI came home early, around noon. I suspected I\u2019d find Lucy in the new nursery. Lately she spends the whole day in there, arranging and rearranging it. Imagine, I\u2019m rounding the door, eager to surprise my wife by coming home for luncheon\u2014</p><p>only to find her standing atop a tiny three-legged table, adjusting the netting that goes round the cradle.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cOf course I startled her, and with her being so awkward and round, perched on that spindly table ...\u201d</p> <p>Toby\u2019s heart stalled. \u201cDid she fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI raced to her side and bodily hauled her down from the table. I may have uttered some rather coarse words in the process.\u201d</p><p>Toby fought the urge to chuckle, imagining that scene. \u201cAnd how did Lucy take that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think?\u201d Jeremy raised an eyebrow. \u201cOf course she took offense, started berating me for my interference. But damn it, she could have fallen at any moment. What was the woman thinking? We have no shortage of servants to fuss with netting, if that was what she desired. No, Lucy had to do it herself\u2014never mind her own safety, or that of the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all get like that, when the time is close.\u201d Toby sipped his drink. \u201cToward the end of my sister Fanny\u2019s last pregnancy, her husband found her down on her hands and knees, using a hairpin to clean the grooves between the kitchen floorboards.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy shook his head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the fact that I pulled her down, it was everything that came afterward. We argued, like we haven\u2019t argued since the first weeks of our marriage. I was so damned scared, and then I was so damned angry. The things I said to her, Toby ... Lucy will never forgive me. That\u2019s why she\u2019s refusing to see me now. She knows I pushed her away, pushed her into labor before her time. She wants to punish me, and God knows I deserve it.\u201d</p> <p>He made a fist and pressed it against the window sash. \u201cRight now, I scarcely care about the baby, that\u2019s what a fiend I am. I just want Lucy to be all right. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I lost her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t lose her.\u201d Toby put a hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cJem, I hate to put it this way, but Lucy knew well before this morning what an overbearing tyrant you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn addle-brained brute.\u201d Jeremy grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s what she calls me when she\u2019s cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. She knows you\u2019re an addle-brained brute, then. But she also knows you love her. And she loves you. You\u2019re not the only one with protective impulses. If she\u2019s keeping you away, I doubt it\u2019s from some desire to punish you. If I know Lucy, she\u2019s the one shielding you. As your little row this morning proves, you can\u2019t bear to see her in distress. She knows that, and she doesn\u2019t want this to be any harder for you than it already is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d Jeremy rubbed his temples. \u201cBut I wish to God you were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to women, I\u2019m always right.\u201d</p><p>With that, Toby lost his grip on the conversation. Joss and Gray had long ago ceased talking, and the room tumbled into a well of silence. Eerie, lifeless silence. No screaming Lucy. No wailing infant. Just silence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone quiet up there,\u201d Gray finally said. \u201cOr had you noticed?\u201d</p><p>Toby cursed inwardly. Of course he\u2019d noticed. He\u2019d been trying not to speculate on what it meant.</p><p>Jeremy returned to his armchair and sank into it. With a low moan, he buried his face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Joss said. \u201cShe won\u2019t die, not today.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy made a sound of derision. \u201cSuddenly you\u2019re the voice of optimism? How do you know she\u2019ll be fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know.\u201d</p><p>Before there was any time to elucidate that pronouncement, Miss Osborne entered the salon. The young woman\u2019s apron was rumpled and stained, but her cool self-possession was intact. Her placid expression revealed no hint of emotion, neither sorrow nor joy. \u201cLord Kendall,\u201d she said, \u201cLucy\u2019s asking for you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Jeremy groaned. \u201cShe\u2019s dying, isn\u2019t she? That\u2019s the only reason she\u2019d want to see me. She wouldn\u2019t ask for me unless she was dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dying,\u201d Miss Osborne said.</p><p>Jeremy paused. \u201cThe child?\u201d</p><p>The young lady sighed. \u201cMy lord, I think you should go upstairs and see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy swore under his breath. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good. Are you certain Lucy wants to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain. She asked for you, in no uncertain terms.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy rose to his feet. \u201cTell me what she said. I want to know her exact words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Miss Osborne crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI believe they were something like this: \u2018Tell my addle-brained brute of a husband that his son is in need of a name.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Toby added his voice to the masculine chorus of congratulations. \u201cYou see, I told you all would be well. You\u2019ve gained a son, and you haven\u2019t lost Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t I?\u201d Jeremy\u2019s face remained impassive. \u201cYou heard her words. She can\u2019t forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t allow me to finish, my lord.\u201d The faintest hint of a smile played on Miss Osborne\u2019s lips. \u201cShe said, tell my addle-brained brute of a husband that his son is in need of a name, and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his wife is in need of a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Toby imagined that a rare smile cracked Jeremy\u2019s stern expression as he bolted from the room</p><p>\u2014but he didn\u2019t really notice his friend\u2019s exit. His attention was occupied with the arrival of Sophia. She brushed past Miss Osborne and flew straight to Gray\u2019s embrace, burying her face in his chest. As she wept, Gray exhaled with obvious relief, releasing a string of colorful oaths befitting a seaman. Toby would never have uttered such words in a lady\u2019s presence\u2014hell, he\u2019d never even heard a few of them before\u2014but Sophia didn\u2019t seem to mind. Her shoulders shook with laughter along with the tears.</p><p>Then he noticed Joss and Miss Osborne exchanging peculiar glances. The two stared at one another, not speaking\u2014Miss Osborne still frozen in the doorway and Joss still reclined on the settee, arms propped behind his head. Toby could not quite name the emotions conveyed in</p><p>their eyes, but he could tell they were of a private nature. No gentleman\u2014not even one as illmannered as Joss\u2014greeted a lady in that posture unless some intimacy existed between them. Well, this was a day of surprises. Of all the unlikely couples in the world ...</p><p>Feeling a voyeur, Toby turned to stare out the window. A profound sense of envy welled inside him. It wasn\u2019t jealousy. No longer did he hate Gray for stealing Sophia. Clearly the two belonged together, and without their marriage, Toby would never have found Isabel. No, he envied Gray\u2014and Jeremy, and perhaps now Joss, too\u2014for a different reason altogether. They were loved, unreservedly. Unconditionally. Not just for their strengths, but for their weaknesses, as well. Jeremy could rant and roar at his wife by morning, and find forgiveness before nightfall. Sophia was devoted to her husband, whether he was a f\u00eated knight or a coarse sea captain.</p><p>Toby knew Isabel cared for him. So long as he lived up to all her ideals, he felt secure in her esteem. But just how long would that be? He was only human, after all. Even if he managed to come through this election business unscathed ... he\u2019d always known, from the day of their wedding onward, that he would inevitably falter in her estimation. When Isabel did see him at his most callow, self-serving worst, he would have no loving reprieve. It would be over. What a fool he was. He\u2019d been working so hard to win his wife\u2019s heart, he\u2019d neglected to guard his own. Now it beat for her, yearned for her, and the stakes were higher than ever. If he lost her regard now ...</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d</p><p>A light touch warmed his hand. Isabel had entered so quietly, he hadn\u2019t even heard her. But here she was\u2014solemn, graceful, and so damned beautiful his heart ached. Only the shadows pooling under her eyes betrayed her fatigue. He pulled her into his arms, settling her weight against his chest. \u201cOh, my dear girl. How hard you\u2019ve worked today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a beautiful baby,\u201d she murmured, nestling into his body.</p><p>\u201cOf course he is.\u201d He pressed a kiss to the crown of her head, inhaling the familiar verbena essence of her hair. He loved this scent, so fresh and comforting. He loved this woman. Someday he would tell her so\u2014and then stand there with his heart lodged in his throat, waiting to hear if she felt the same.</p><p>But not today. Today, he was all out of words.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>\u201cReally, Toby. Are you certain it\u2019s proper?\u201d Isabel frowned up at the gilded, curlicued sign: Mme. Pamplemousse, Modiste. A young couple jostled past, causing her feet to shuffle on the Bond Street pavement. \u201cDo gentlemen truly accompany their wives to such a place?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, holding open the door for her. \u201cGentlemen usually accompany their mistresses to such a place.\u201d</p><p>Bel halted, one slipper balanced on the threshold.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so anxious,\u201d he teased, prodding her inside and up the narrow staircase. \u201cI wasn\u2019t referring to me. If I\u2019d brought a mistress to this establishment, I wouldn\u2019t bring my wife around now, would I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir Toby!\u201d As they reached the top, an unseen woman called from the interior. Her voice blended silk and smoke. \u201cMon dieu. We thought you\u2019d never return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Bel asked, eyeing her husband warily as she stepped inside. A dazzling sight waited within. Bolts of fabric in every color of the rainbow, lining both walls in perfect, parallel symmetry. After blinking a few times, she realized the fabric actually lined one wall, and mirrors covered the other, creating the illusion. Spools of ribbon and lace filled any available gap between the bolts, and toward the window, a glass case held a glittering array of plumes and brilliants. The crowded, colorful space gave the appearance of disarray, but the floorboards beneath Bel\u2019s slippers gleamed. The corners were the cleanest parts of the room, free of cobwebs or collected dust.</p><p>\u201cWe heard you had married.\u201d A silver-haired matron clad in violet silk swished forward to greet them, her broad hips trading the rustling weight of her skirts back and forth. As the woman took Toby\u2019s arm, her thin, dark eyebrows rose. \u201cWe did not want to believe it. We were so delighted when you escaped that little pale thing, that Sophie. She had an eye for color, that one, but I always knew she would have played you false.\u201d She turned to Bel. \u201cBut I see your taste has improved. This one, she is not English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly half,\u201d Bel told her.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Madame said, looking Bel up, then down. \u201cOne hopes it is the correct half.\u201d</p> <p>Bel gaped at Toby. He gave her a sly grin. \u201cIsabel, allow me to introduce Madame. She\u2019s designed every one of my sister Margaret\u2019s gowns, since her debut Season. I was Margaret\u2019s unwilling escort for many a fitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnwilling?\u201d The Frenchwoman pursed her lips in a rouge-red moue. \u201cThis does not match with Mirette\u2019s account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMirette?\u201d Bel bit her lip. Had she said that aloud?</p><p>Madame Pamplemousse grasped Bel\u2019s arm. \u201cMy niece and apprentice seamstress, come from Paris to learn our trade. Sir Toby corrupted her most horribly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI corrupted her?\u201d Toby laughed. \u201cI was a tender fifteen years old. That niece of yours had three years on me, and a half-dozen beaux on her chatelaine. It was all I could to wheedle a kiss.\u201d</p><p>The modiste made a very French sound of skepticism. \u201cWhat of Josephine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPray, let us not speak of Josephine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie-Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us not speak of Marie-Claire either.\u201d Toby pressed a hand to his lapel and made a dramatic face. \u201cDo you know, this shop made a pincushion of my adolescent heart. Sent me down the path toward waste and ruin. Forget good intentions. I tell you, the road to hell is paved with toile. But\u2014\u201d His hand caught Bel\u2019s waist. \u201cI have here to protect me my very own angel, who is determined to redeem my corrupted soul.\u201d</p><p>Madame Pamplemousse turned her kohl-rimmed gaze on Bel. Her lips curved in a feline smile.</p><p>\u201cAn angel? I do not think so. Not even half.\u201d She slowly circled Bel, running her palms over the contours of her shoulders, her arms. Then her hips. Bel stiffened.</p><p>\u201cArms to the side, ma ch\u00e8re.\u201d With two well-placed jabs to the ribcage, Madame forced Bel\u2019s arms out. Then, grasping her by the hips, the modiste pivoted her body until they faced the wall of mirrors. Bel felt rather like a marionette.</p><p>\u201cTo be a true angel,\u201d the modiste said, sliding her hands up Bel\u2019s corseted torso, \u201cyou must offer men a glimpse of heaven.\u201d With that, she cupped Bel\u2019s bosom in her palms and thrust upward, until olive skin overflowed her muslin bodice in two generous scoops. Mortified, Bel worked her throat. No sounds came out. Most likely, the woman had cut off her supply of air. Fortunately, Toby had bent over the display case and was not watching.</p><p>\u201cYes, much better,\u201d Madame said, scrutinizing Bel\u2019s reflection. \u201cLady Aldridge, we will make you a proper corset. One that will have these\u201d\u2014she plumped the handfuls of flesh again</p> <p>\u2014\u201cfloating like clouds.\u201d</p><p>The modiste dropped her hands, and Bel\u2019s breasts fell back into her stays with a nearly audible plunk. Immediately, she crossed her arms over her chest to ward off any further assault. She must be nearing her courses. Her bosom was already heavy and achy today, and Madame\u2019s liberties hadn\u2019t helped matters any.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a gown,\u201d Toby said, turning from his study of plumes. \u201cSuitable for the opera, ready three days hence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe opera?\u201d Bel echoed. \u201cBut we can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days?\u201d Madame clucked her tongue. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly we can,\u201d Toby said, striding forward and meeting Bel\u2019s gaze in the mirrored reflection. Turning to Madame, he continued, \u201cAnd it is possible. I have seen you work miracles before. Don\u2019t tell me those nimble fingers are losing their touch, Maxime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you know of my nimble fingers?\u201d She threw him a coquettish glance as she retrieved a measuring tape from a drawer. \u201cYou should not have wasted your time with those girls, mon lapin. I would have corrupted you beyond all hope of redemption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises,\u201d said Toby, catching the Frenchwoman\u2019s hand and kissing her fingers playfully. Then he murmured something in French. Something that sounded exceedingly ribald</p><p>\u2014but then, in French, nearly everything sounded ribald.</p><p>From behind the draperies at the back of the room came a chorus of feminine giggles. Ribald it must have been.</p><p>Bel sighed. She wondered if she would ever grow accustomed to watching Toby flirt with other women. The envy nipping at her elbows was absurd, she knew. Like Madame, most of his partners in this sort of repartee were not even especially young or attractive. They were simply women Toby sought to amuse or flatter, for one reason or another. She doubted he was even aware of it, this constant trade in compliments, any more than he tracked the pennies that entered and left his pocket. He gave the ladies what was, in essence, a glittering token: a fleeting moment of feeling desired by the most attractive man in London. In return, they gave him ... pretty much what ever he wished. And as she was well aware of her husband\u2019s desirability, Bel could not argue that it was an unfair trade.</p><p>At least he did not treat her the same way. He gave Bel more than moments, she reminded herself. He gave her whole nights of tender affection and asked nothing in return. And it wasn\u2019t as though she expected his wholehearted devotion. It wasn\u2019t as though she wanted his love. Therefore, she should not be jealous. In fact, she ought to encourage his use of charm\u2014</p><p>the same talent, albeit differently employed, would ensure his political success. But still. Those giggles grated on her nerves, to an alarming degree. She really must be nearing her courses.</p><p>Growing even more tetchy at that thought, she protested, \u201cWe can\u2019t go to the opera this week. You can\u2019t expect the polls to close early again.\u201d He\u2019d surprised her that afternoon, arriving home shortly after luncheon due to some unexpected event. \u201cWhat was the reason, again? The returning officer\u2019s wife took ill?\u201d</p><p>If he heard her question, he did not acknowledge it. \u201cOn the day of the opera, I\u2019ll simply leave early. A few hours\u2019 absence from the hustings won\u2019t damage my campaign. It may hurt the tavern keeper\u2019s profits, but that can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way, my lady.\u201d The modiste beckoned her toward the rear of the shop. \u201cWe will take measurements.\u201d</p><p>Bel ignored her. \u201cWell, even if your schedule will accommodate frivolity, mine will not. The Society is planning our demonstration of chimney-sweeping machinery on Friday. There are leaflets to be printed, invitations to be delivered. I must speak with Cook about the refreshments, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel.\u201d He placed a hand on her shoulder. It was a weighty, authoritative gesture, and it made Bel keenly aware of how childish she sounded. \u201cIt\u2019s an opera,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cNot a bacchanal. Why does the idea distress you so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know.\u201d And she honestly didn\u2019t. But it did distress her, greatly. She didn\u2019t like being in this shop, perfumed as it was with Toby\u2019s amatory past. She wished they could just leave. \u201cI don\u2019t need a new gown,\u201d she tried again. \u201cI have a closet full of gowns at home.\u201d</p><p>Toby dismissed them all with a shake of his head. \u201cDebutante gowns. Virginal, modest, pretty. You\u2019re a married lady of wealth and influence, and you ought to look it. Worldly, bold, exquisite.\u201d</p><p>Bel frowned. None of those words described her in the least.</p><p>Madame Pamplemousse tugged at her again. \u201cCome then, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a moment,\u201d Toby told the modiste. \u201cIsabel, tell me about your demonstration. What is its purpose?\u201d</p><p>Had she not told him a dozen times? Didn\u2019t he listen to her at all? Her voice clipped and impatient, she answered, \u201cTo demonstrate the modern advances in flue-cleaning machinery. To convince the influential ladies of society that climbing boys are inefficient and obsolete. To keep poor children from suffocating to death in chimneys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And worthy goals, all. But do you really think the machinery\u2019s efficiency will be the persuasive factor? No, of course not. Perhaps if you were inviting housekeepers it would be, but the ladies of the ton care little for function. They care for fashion. To persuade them to take notice of automated brushes, you must make those brushes appear beautiful, desirable, and au courant. More to the point, you must appear beautiful, desirable, and au courant\u2014and therefore, worthy of emulation. The first two qualities, God has already provided. Let us entrust Madame with the third, hm?\u201d</p><p>Bel gave up. It seemed ridiculous, the idea that her purchasing an opulent gown would somehow save the lives of miserable waifs. But the argument was so tangled now, she didn\u2019t know how to unravel it.</p><p>Toby spoke to the Frenchwoman. \u201cShe needs rich color, and sparkle, and the most stylish cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Madame tutted, herding Bel toward the room\u2019s fabric partition.</p><p>\u201cI want her shining like the jewel she is,\u201d Toby called after them as they ducked behind the velvet drapery.</p><p>\u201cFirst I was an angel,\u201d Bel muttered as two young maids beset her, prying apart hooks and unlacing tapes. \u201cNow I\u2019m a jewel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d the modiste said in a lilting whisper, \u201cbe happy your husband admires you so and wants others to admire you, too. Take care you do not drive him to call you unpleasant names. Take care you do not drive him into another\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><p>One of the maids made a comment in French. Bel couldn\u2019t understand the exact words, but she gathered the general implication: The girl\u2019s own arms would be open and available, should Bel fail to heed Madame\u2019s advice.</p><p>More giggling.</p><p>Bel growled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that giggling about?\u201d Toby called in a teasing voice. \u201cMust I come back there and supervise?\u201d</p><p>The maids tittered at the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bel answered sharply. \u201cAll is well.\u201d Except for this unreasoned, bitter jealousy in her heart. She flung her arms wide to aid the young women in removing her clothes. \u201cLet\u2019s do this quickly, please?\u201d</p><p>Madame Pamplemousse lifted her voice. \u201cSir Toby, be seated. There are newspapers behind the counter, should you require diversion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there?\u201d The sounds of his footfalls and rustling paper filtered through the draperies. His tone became one of amused discovery. \u201cYes, indeed there are. Including the most diverting publication of all... The Prattler. What are they saying about me today, I wonder?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bel winced. \u201cToby, don\u2019t.

Perhaps I ought to deliver copies when I ride out there each morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Bel said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cBecause\u2014according to today\u2019s edition\u2014I\u2019m not riding to Surrey at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says right here, I\u2019ve been completely absent from the hustings. My entire candidacy is a sham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? But that\u2019s absurd!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Toby\u2019s slow footfalls crossed the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course it is. You\u2019ve been gone from dawn to dusk every day. Where else would you have been spending your time?\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cDo you really wish to know?\u201d</p><p>Bel considered. Did she? His serious tone boded ill, but in the end her curiosity won out. \u201cYes. Yes, read me what ever scandalous falsehood they\u2019re peddling now.\u201d</p><p>He heaved a dramatic sigh. \u201cWell, according to this distinguished publication, I\u2019ve been spending my days here in London, at the Hidden Pearl. There\u2019s a charming illustration provided by Mr. Hollyhurst. Would you care to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bel closed her eyes. \u201cDare I guess the nature of this establishment, the Hidden Pearl? I don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s a shop that sells jewels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell... I wouldn\u2019t call them jewels. Cheap trinkets, more like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby!\u201d Bel\u2019s teeth ground together. How he found this amusing was beyond her comprehension. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d She jostled on one leg as a maid peeled the muslin gown from her torso. \u201cBut that\u2019s a preposterous assertion!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely,\u201d Toby agreed. His voice sounded nearer now, just on the other side of the drapery. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone near the Hidden Pearl in weeks.\u201d</p><p>Bel gasped with indignation.</p><p>\u201cVery well, months.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the drape to the side and craned her neck around it to glare at him. He grinned at her over the paper. \u201cYears?\u201d</p><p>Insufferable tease. \u201cIt\u2019s not a laughing matter, Toby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. As you say, it\u2019s a preposterous assertion. The only thing for it is to laugh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe know it to be preposterous, but what of everyone else? What if people read that paper and believe that you ... that you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a penchant for trinkets?\u201d His eyebrow quirked. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re jealous. Have you so little faith in me?\u201d</p><p>Bel gripped the curtain to her chest and blinked away an unshed tear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so out of sorts today.\u201d</p><p>But she did know. Stupid girl, she chided herself. She\u2019d been well aware of Toby\u2019s reputation before she married him. Her husband was an infamous rake. What had she thought, that public speculation would miraculously cease on their wedding day? That the women of London would stop batting their lashes in his direction? That The Prattler would plaster his image on a broadsheet as a sterling example of morality\u2014\u201cThe Rake Reformed\u201d?</p><p>Stupid, stupid girl.</p><p>Toby\u2019s gaze flitted back and forth between her face and the velvet drape wrapped around her chest. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely color on you,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cYes, that will serve very well.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed.</p><p>\u201cCome with me to the opera, darling.\u201d Tossing aside the newspaper, he framed her face in his warm, confident hands. His brown eyes held her, made her strong. \u201cLet me dress you up and devastate London with your beauty. I promise you, no newspaper will dare accuse me of dallying again\u2014because no one would ever believe it. They\u2019ll know, no painted bauble at the Hidden Pearl could ever compare with the radiant, elegant woman I married. One look at us together, and they will know the truth.\u201d His thumb stroked her cheek. \u201cThere\u2019s no other lady for me.\u201d</p><p>Bel\u2019s lips pressed together. The rest of her fell apart. Oh, how she wished he would kiss her. Right here in the modiste\u2019s fitting room, while she stood wrapped in her shift and a velvet curtain, in front of all these preening French coquettes.</p><p>He did.</p><p>And this time, she did not mind the giggling.</p><p>Toby held that kiss just as long as he dared. While he kissed her, her lips couldn\u2019t form questions. While he kissed her, his lips couldn\u2019t lie.</p><p>There\u2019s no other lady for me.</p><p>That much was the truth. The simple, soul-baring truth, and he poured it all into this chaste, sweet kiss, hoping his wife could feel and believe it.</p><p>Lord knew, she wasn\u2019t too quick to recognize truth when it was spoken aloud. His heart still pounded in his chest, after that close scrape just now with The Prattler. He\u2019d come a heartbeat from simply confessing everything. But once again, she\u2019d displayed such complete faith in him, he just couldn\u2019t bring himself to destroy it. Confession was out of the question.</p><p>No, Toby had a different plan.</p><p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d he whispered, breaking the kiss. \u201cBe a good girl and have your measurements. Allow me to discuss the style with Madame. I\u2019ll make certain you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>And he would, he vowed silently, dropping a final kiss between her eyebrows. He would make her happy. Underneath all those angelic ideals and heavenly curves beat a heart that was simply human. Simply woman. And though he might have no head for philanthropy or politics, Toby understood women.</p><p>He had this one week. For God knew what reason, he and Yorke remained close in the polls, but the numbers were certain to turn at the end. In a handful of days, the polling would close and Colin Brooks would certify his defeat. Somehow, in that short window of time, he had to replace Isabel\u2019s na\u00efve faith in him with deeper emotions, ones he could sustain. It was time to step up his campaign, and it all began with the opera. She was so wary of life\u2019s little amusements\u2014ices, jewels, beautiful gowns. Plea sure distressed her, for some unfathomable reason, but he could help her overcome that distress. Surely his success in the bedchamber could be repeated in other settings. He could teach her to enjoy herself, and to enjoy being with him. He would make her feel perfect and adored and deserving of every indulgence the world had to offer.</p><p>And then, she would surrender her political dreams and embrace a future of domestic bliss. He didn\u2019t have to destroy her faith in him, just give it a new foundation. Love. That was the plan.</p><p>And if he got her with child in the process ... call it insurance.</p><p>\u201cOh, Madame?\u201d he called, holding up the edge of the velvet drape. \u201cCe couleur, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBon choix, monsieur.\u201d</p><p>He traded instructions with the modiste in French, so that Isabel would be unable to understand, and therefore unable to object. Aside from the gown for Tuesday, he ordered three more evening gowns and five day dresses, as well as a full complement of petticoats and the like. His wife would have protested the expenditure with every word in her bilingual vocabulary\u2014but Toby knew her to be worth every penny, and more.</p><p>An hour later, they emerged from the shop.</p><p>\u201cFancy a drive in the park?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Isabel shook her head violently. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>Toby cursed inwardly. Stupid suggestion, that. Ever since that incident in Surrey, she suffered carriage rides with all the enjoyment of a kitten receiving a bath.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you need to buy?\u201d He tucked her hand in his arm. \u201cOr shall we find a teashop and take some refreshment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry, thank you. But if there is a draper\u2019s nearby, the children\u2019s dispensary is in need of new bed linens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He turned them left, and together they ambled down the street. \u201cWhile we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s choose some for ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we? Don\u2019t we deserve new linens, just as much as sickly foundlings do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that,\u201d she hissed, in a voice that communicated her wish for him to lower his own. \u201cIt\u2019s not proper, for a husband and wife to go shopping for bed linens together. \u201c</p><p>\u201cWhyever not? Seems the most proper thing in the world, to me. But if we are to be shocking, why stop at linen? Let\u2019s order five sets of sheets in aubergine satin.\u201d</p><p>She did not even reply to that, aside from turning a shade that hinted toward aubergine, herself. He murmured in her ear, \u201cHave you ever experienced that sensation, Isabel? The feel of satin against bare skin? All your bare skin?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed. \u201cToby, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? It\u2019s like gliding through water, darling. Cool and smooth at first. And then the heat of your flesh makes it warm and slick, like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby,\u201d she growled, drawing to a halt. \u201cYou must stop. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike oil,\u201d he finished, bending low to whisper in her ear. \u201cOil, perfumed with the musk of your skin and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her bright voice interrupted him. \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Yorke.\u201d</p><p>Toby froze, his lips poised less than an inch from his wife\u2019s ear. Fortunate thing he hadn\u2019t followed the impulse to lick it. As if sensing itself in danger, Isabel\u2019s ear dipped out of reach. Right. She was curtsying.</p><p>Following his wife\u2019s example, Toby greeted his silver-haired friend with a polite bow. \u201cYorke. Hadn\u2019t expected to meet with you in Town.\u201d In other words, why the devil aren\u2019t you at the hustings, in Surrey?</p><p>The old man regarded him with a bemused expression. \u201cHadn\u2019t expected to meet with you, either.\u201d</p><p>Isabel said, \u201cYes, so unfortunate isn\u2019t it? The returning officer\u2019s wife, taken ill.\u201d</p><p>Yorke looked to Toby. \u201cMrs. Brooks took ill?\u201d</p><p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cSurely you heard?\u201d Isabel asked. \u201cWeren\u2019t you there when they closed the polls earlier?\u201d She looked to Toby. \u201cBut perhaps I misunderstood.\u201d</p><p>Toby glared at the old man until he startled, realizing his mistake.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Yorke said hastily. \u201cYes, of course. She took ill. What was her ailment...?\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cRheumatism.\u201d</p><p>This would have been a perfectly acceptable answer, had Toby not chosen the exact same moment to blurt out, \u201cThe grippe.\u201d</p><p>Isabel\u2019s brow creased as she looked from Toby to Yorke, and then back.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s achy, you know. And generally out of sorts. Bit of a fever, some stiffness. It\u2019s a medical mystery, really. She has the doctor quite flummoxed.\u201d The words streamed from Toby\u2019s mouth at record speed. If he spoke quickly and incoherently enough, he might squeak through this muddle. He hoped. \u201cBut last I heard, she\u2019s on the mend. I\u2019m certain the polls will reopen Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Yorke said. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll see you on Monday, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Monday.\u201d Toby said, absorbing Mr. Yorke\u2019s strange look. A look that said the crafty old fellow would be nowhere near Surrey on Monday.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re staying in town, perhaps we\u2019ll meet at church tomorrow,\u201d Isabel said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, Lady Aldridge.\u201d With a smile and a tip of his hat, Mr. Yorke went on his way. Toby stared after him. What the hell was going on? Toby hadn\u2019t been in Surrey today, but apparently neither had Yorke. Was it possible the old man wasn\u2019t even campaigning? It would explain why the polls remained so close, and the turnout of electors so low. He found himself wanting to chase after Yorke, take him to the club for some quality liquor and one of their honest discussions. The man was hiding something, and Toby was, too. And he didn\u2019t know where that left them, but he knew it was a great deal further apart than they\u2019d been before. That was a damned shame. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scenarios tumbled together in his mind. There was no way to explain it, except to assume</p><p>Yorke wasn\u2019t making much effort at reelection. And if that was the case, the unthinkable could happen.</p><p>Toby could actually win.</p> <p>\u201cToby?\u201d Isabel pulled on his arm. \u201cThe bed linens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, gathering his wits and flashing her a carefree smile. \u201cAubergine satin.\u201d</p><p>What was he thinking? He had no chance of victory. Yorke knew that too, that\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t even bothering to make an effort. And really, which was a better use of Toby\u2019s time?</p><p>Trolling the farmlands of Surrey for votes, or waging a campaign of sensual persuasion to win the heart of his beautiful wife?</p><p>No contest there.</p> <p>Winning the election would be a mere temporary victory\u2014a stay of execution, until Isabel next put him to the test. No, to ensure their lasting happiness, he had to win her. And he would. He had a new weapon in his arsenal now: Love. He loved her, and that had to count for something. He only hoped it would count for enough.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>\u201cToby, it is indecent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is merely a well-cut and finely-sewn piece of silk, with no moral code to speak of. And you, my dear wife, are ravishing.\u201d</p><p>Isabel tugged at the bodice of her gown, trying to coax it higher. She turned slightly, eyeing the effect in her mirrored reflection. Perhaps she could tuck a fichu under the neckline? Oh, what was the use? A mortifying amount of cleavage would still be on display. It would be like trimming a haunch of mutton with paper frills, and hoping they discouraged the appetite.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Toby said, his reflected image sidling up behind hers, \u201cthe style is not so brazen as you think. It\u2019s practically prudish by French standards.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut we are not in France.\u201d And never would they travel there, if Bel had anything to say about it. It wasn\u2019t only the cut of the gown that shocked her. The deep wine-red hue was the color of sin itself, and the crystals sewn into the bodice flashed like little beacons designed to draw prurient attention. But Toby had ordered the gown made thus, and judging by his expression in the mirror, Bel assumed he was well pleased with the result. \u201cI just feel so exposed. But if it pleases you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does please me, and that is why. Because you are exposed. That\u2019s what the opera is about\u2014</p><p>seeing and being seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the opera was about Don Juan.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Toby placed his hands on her nearly-bare shoulders. Tracing lazy circles with his thumbs, he leaned over to brush a kiss below her ear. \u201cI love your hair like this, upswept.\u201d His lips trailed down her neck and over her nape. \u201cSo tightly coiled and expertly bound.\u201d The words sent excitement rippling down her spine. \u201cIt makes me think of the exquisite joy I will have, freeing it later tonight.\u201d His tongue flicked against her ear. As he drew his fingertips down the sensitive flesh of her arms, Bel\u2019s knees dissolved. At this rate, they would never leave the house. She could not say that she would mind. Their planned outing made her uncomfortable, in any number of ways.</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful,\u201d he crooned, resting his chin on her shoulder and wrapping his arms around her. Together they stared at their entwined reflections. \u201cWe are beautiful together.\u201d</p><p>She had to concede they did make a striking couple. People commented on it so often, she was growing accustomed to hearing it.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll make love to you like this,\u201d he whispered. \u201cRight here, in front of the mirror.\u201d</p> <p>Comments like that, on the other hand, she had not grown accustomed to hearing. At all. Not that they were unpleasant to her ear. She loved hearing how badly he wanted her\u2014loved feeling the evidence of it pulsing against her back. Her cheeks went crimson in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cWould you like that?\u201d he asked, his voice an insidious rumble against her nape. \u201cWould you like me to strip you bare and kiss you all over until you watch yourself cry out in ecstasy?\u201d</p><p>Just the suggestion had her moist and aching between her legs. She swallowed hard. Her voice came out as a squeak. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>His smiling brown eyes caught hers in the mirror. \u201cNo. Not now. Later. For now, it is enough to know you desire me.\u201d His voice grew rough, and his hands moved down, roving over her silk-sheathed hips. \u201cIsabel. I want you to want me, the way that I want you. All the time. Always. Tonight your beauty may be on display for all London to see, but underneath this gown, you belong to me. All evening long, in your darkest, most secret places, I want you hot and wet and yearning for me. And when we come home, I intend to claim what\u2019s mine. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, entranced by the commanding desire in his eyes and aroused beyond all reason. Her nipples peaked, and she turned in his arms, rubbing her breasts against his strong, solid chest to ease the ache. If only he would make love to her now, strip her free of this indecent gown and make her tremble with pleasure.</p><p>She pressed her lips to his throat. \u201cToby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d Grasping her by the elbows, he pulled away. His eyes bored into hers. \u201cIsabel. I want you to want me, the way that I want you. And that is not the work of a few minutes. No, to make you truly comprehend, I shall require hours, darling. Hours.\u201d</p><p>Hours? He meant to make her wait for hours?</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d She knew he would laugh the moment she asked. But she couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cHow many hours?\u201d</p><p>To his credit, he did not laugh too loudly. He tucked her arm in his and steered her toward the door. \u201cWell, the performance itself is nigh on four. Then we have the carriage rides to and fro, the intermission ...\u201d His free hand cupped her bottom as he guided her into the corridor. They nearly collided with a footman, and Bel gasped. Toby quickly donned his usual grin\u2014</p><p>that charming expression of equal parts innocence and devilry. \u201cI should say above five hours, Lady Aldridge. Why ever do you ask?\u201d</p><p>Five hours. How many had passed? Not even one yet, by Bel\u2019s estimation. And here she was practically a puddle of wax on the floor of their theater box. How would she survive the night?</p><p>It was a private box, of course. Perfectly chosen for this war of seduction her husband seemed so intent on waging. Seduction was not even the right word\u2014that would imply he sought her surrender. No, this was a campaign of subtle, sensual teasing with no end in sight. It was not battle, but torture.</p><p>It was exquisite.</p><p>In the carriage, he\u2019d stared blankly out the small window in an attitude of perfect nonchalance. All the while, his gloved fingers were working their way beneath her voluminous skirts, caressing her calf, her knee, her thigh.</p><p>When they joined the crush of opera attendees, he held her close at his side, guiding her through the crowd with an authoritative touch. With an insouciant smile pasted on his face, he kept up a steady stream of suggestive whispers in her ear. To the casual onlooker, it probably looked as though he were relating the latest on-dit, or perhaps discussing the weather. But the only humidity of note was the perspiration collecting between her breasts, not to mention the veritable storm of arousal gathering at the apex of her thighs.</p><p>And now they were seated in their box, surrounded by ornate, gilded majesty and cascades of heavy blue velvet, listening to the discordant hum of the orchestra tuning their instruments. Toby pressed a glass of champagne into her hand.</p><p>Bel stared at it, entranced by the small bubbles soaring to the glassy, amber surface. \u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t. You know I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, you do. This is the opera, my dear. It\u2019s about excess, spectacle, sensation, and opulence. It\u2019s about pleasure. We\u2019ve been working so hard, between the charities and the campaign. You\u2019ve earned the right to enjoy yourself tonight. Have I not earned the right to spoil you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. He was right, they had both been working tirelessly over the past week. Every day, Toby rode out to the hustings in Surrey while Bel went about her charitable endeavors. In the evenings, they reunited just in time for dinner and bed, where a bout of lovemaking\u2014</p><p>sometimes tender, sometimes wild\u2014sent them into an exhausted sleep. There was no doubt in Bel\u2019s mind that her husband had been laboring tirelessly to satisfy her, in every way. How could she deny him this one evening of amusement?</p><p>She took a small sip of the champagne. The tart-sweet taste exploded on her tongue, fizzing through her whole body.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so strange.\u201d She sipped again, holding the potent liquid in her mouth. Bubbles teased her nose, and she swallowed, giggling. \u201cBut delicious.\u201d</p><p>She sipped again and closed her eyes. When she opened them, the world stayed dark. It took her a moment to realize they had dimmed the gaslights to signal the beginning of the performance. Her brain felt misty. The air was cottony around her, warm and soft to the touch.</p><p>\u201cMay I taste?\u201d Toby asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She offered him the glass, but that wasn\u2019t what he wanted. She realized her mistake the instant before his mouth captured hers. As their lips met, some champagne-soaked shred of her conscience trilled in alarm. Here they were kissing in public. In full view, for anyone to see.</p><p>It was marvelous.</p><p>She leaned into the kiss, caressing his tongue with hers, sipping lightly at his lower lip. She couldn\u2019t get enough of him, and she wanted all London to see. Perhaps it was the champagne, or the rich surroundings, or the arousal he\u2019d so cleverly been stoking all night. But at that moment, Bel wanted the world to know how much her husband desired her, how much she desired him. How beautiful they were together, how young and alive. Then the orchestra struck a chord, and she jumped in her seat. The kiss broke apart. Champagne splattered the exposed tops of her breasts and the bodice of her indecent, extravagant gown\u2014and she didn\u2019t even care. Because the music was beginning, and the music</p><p>... it was everything.</p><p>The orchestra launched into the overture, and Bel felt certain the power of the music would lift the roof from the opera house. She felt it reverberating in her bones. She breathed it into her lungs. It had colors, and flavors\u2014and that was when Bel realized she must be a bit drunk, to believe she could taste a piece of music. But she sipped her champagne again, wanting to stay drunk forever. Wanting to drown in this sea of glorious sound.</p><p>Then the curtain opened to reveal a fantastic garden and costumed performers who shortly began to sing. With voices surely stolen from angels, they sang. And the whole world fell away. Bel forgot even Toby. The champagne went flat in her glass. She was swept into the grandeur of Don Giovanni, and if she had not known it to be impossible, she would have later sworn she did not breathe or blink once during the whole of the first act. As the curtain closed for intermission, Toby\u2019s hand covered hers. \u201cAre you enjoying yourself?\u201d</p><p>She clutched his hand. \u201cOh, Toby. It\u2019s wonderful. I never dreamed ...\u201d The amber fog of the gas lamps slowly diffused, and she looked up into his handsome face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThe best is yet to come.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. The unthinkable reality struck with orchestral power. An ominous, thundering chord of truth.</p><p>She loved him.</p><p>What a fool she\u2019d been. It wasn\u2019t the music that made her feel everything so acutely. It wasn\u2019t the champagne that laid waste to her inhibitions. No, it was this man sitting next to her, who\u2019d wreaked havoc on her senses and stoked her passions since the moment they met. It was Toby, all Toby.</p><p>And she loved him.</p><p>A dark, sweet melody played in her heart, and her pulse beat a fierce, insistent percussion. She loved him. Loved him, loved him, and it terrified her.</p><p>Worry creased his brow. \u201cAre you well? Shall I fetch you another glass of champagne?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cPerhaps some water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d He kissed her hand before releasing it. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a trice.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone, giving Bel a few precious moments to collect her thoughts and reevaluate her life. She\u2019d fallen in love with her husband, and now everything was ruined. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>How could she fully devote herself to service and charity, with this loud, symphonic love suffusing her body, drowning out all her best intentions? She tried to recall her schedule for tomorrow. She was certain she had some appointment, some visit scheduled ... perhaps a meeting with the house staff about the upcoming demonstration of flue-sweeping machinery?</p> <p>But for the life of her\u2014for the love of Toby\u2014she couldn\u2019t remember. The champagne\u2019s effect had faded now. Bel saw clearly what she needed to do. She must choose. This love had infected her unawares, but perhaps she still had hope for a cure. It was not too late to deny this passion, to push her husband away and refocus on her work. She\u2019d been in London society long enough to understand the polite, affectionless arrangements that characterized most marriages. She could insist upon the same.</p><p>Or she could love. Freely, deeply\u2014embracing both passion and terror at once. She could place her soul in the keeping of a man well known to be a suave, charming rake. Really, there was no choice at all.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d Toby slid back into the box, a dewy glass of water in his hand. Bel took it, tipping the glass and downing the water gratefully. Slowly. So long as she was drinking, she need not speak. Soon the lights dimmed again, and Toby pulled his chair close to hers. Close enough that she felt his warmth, even in the dark.</p><p>\u201cAre you able to understand the opera?\u201d he asked in a low voice. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any Italian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered back, setting the water glass aside. \u201cBut I learned Spanish from my mother. It\u2019s similar enough that I can follow the story.\u201d And what a story it was\u2014the dashing, infamous lothario and the besotted women who would follow him anywhere, even to his grave. Out of blind, unrequited love.</p> <p>Yes, she\u2019d learned this story from her mother in more ways than one. If her father had had fewer lovers than Don Giovanni\u2019s thousands\u2014it surely was only because their island was so small. And yet, despite the man\u2019s faithless philandering, her mother had loved him with a fierce, loyal passion\u2014even beyond the boundaries of reason and health. The doctors said her mother\u2019s madness was a lingering effect of her brain fever, but her mother had believed otherwise.</p><p>She insisted she\u2019d gone mad with love. El amor es locura, she\u2019d said. Love is madness. An all-consuming, feverish passion that robs the mind of sense, that spins a soul toward darkness and despair.</p><p>Bel would be a fool to follow that example. Her gloved hands fisted in her lap. She must resist this love. She must break free of the bond he\u2019d somehow tied around her heart. Then the woman on stage began to sing, Toby\u2019s hand covered hers, and she knew. She didn\u2019t truly want to be freed.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen this opera before?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does it end?\u201d She turned to him. \u201cI need to know how it ends. Happily?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, darling.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cOur hero dies, alone and unrepentant, and the devil takes his soul to hell.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God help her.</p><p>As she listened to the haunting aria, the hairs rose on Bel\u2019s neck and a familiar, terrible heaviness formed in her chest. She wanted to cry, but the tears wouldn\u2019t come. Until a few weeks ago, she\u2019d believed this to be the sort of tension a woman could only resolve by weeping. Now, thanks to her talented husband, she knew there to be another cure. Her body cried out for the pleasurable release only he could give.</p><p>\u201cRemarkable, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Toby\u2019s whispered question mingled with the fading applause.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cThe way the note hangs in the air, even after she ceases to sing ...</p><p>I know I\u2019m not actually hearing it any longer, but I feel it, resonating in the air. In me.\u201d</p><p>He was silent. Bel\u2019s cheeks heated. She must sound ridiculous and na\u00efve.</p><p>\u201cI understand perfectly,\u201d he finally said. His voice held no trace of amusement\u2014only warmth and tenderness. \u201cI think I feel that way sometimes, when I\u2019m parted from you. Even when you\u2019re not with me, it\u2019s like ... there\u2019s an echo of you that settles in my chest.\u201d He lifted her hand from her lap and brought it to his lips, then pressed it to his solar plexus. \u201cHere. I feel you here, always. Sometimes it hurts.\u201d</p> <p>Bel swallowed hard. \u201cToby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you take me home? I want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d His eyes searched hers in the near dark. \u201cThe second act has only just started. Don\u2019t worry about the ending. It\u2019s a comedy, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go home. Immediately.\u201d Bel squeezed her eyes shut to gather her strength, then opened them again. \u201cI want you,\u201d she said meaningfully, lifting her free hand to cup his strong, handsome jaw, \u201cto take me home.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing. Only sat motionless in the dark, like the chiseled marble likeness of a Roman god. But as she inched closer, Bel thrilled to the evidence that he was very much alive. His breaths came thick and ragged, and his pulse hammered against her hand. Scooting closer, almost into his lap, she craned her neck to kiss him. \u201cI want you,\u201d she murmured against his lips, kissing him again to silence her moan as his free arm lashed about her waist. Oh, how she needed his hands on her. Needed it more than she needed air. She was mad for him, and she didn\u2019t care what price she would pay tomorrow, or for the rest of her life and beyond. Tonight, she just wanted him.</p><p>\u201cI want you to take me home,\u201d she whispered, licking lightly against his ear. \u201cTake me home and make love to me, Toby.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, they were in the carriage.</p><p>It really was a remarkable feat. Toby doubted Isabel could appreciate the amount of strategy, charm, and discreetly exchanged silver required to collapse what was normally a twenty-minute process to less than five. Amazing, what a man could accomplish when his lady lit a fire under him.</p><p>Lit a fire within him, more like.</p><p>Toby was burning for her like he had burned for no woman in his life. The air in the carriage was arid with heat. All his plans for hours of slow, sensual teasing? Evaporated. He wanted her, as soon as he could possibly have her.</p><p>And apparently\u2014miraculously\u2014she felt the same.</p><p>She gripped his arm, pressing her body to his as the coach lurched into motion. The soft swell of her breast against his biceps was pure, sweet torture.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take us to get home?\u201d The throaty pitch of her voice sank straight to his groin.</p><p>Toby cleared his throat. \u201cTen minutes... perhaps fifteen.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent, still clutching his arm. He clenched his hands at his sides to keep from mauling her. She had asked him to take her home, after all. Take her home and make love to her properly. Not sweep her off for a crude, sweaty tup in the coach.</p><p>Suddenly, she launched herself into his lap, hiking up her red silk skirts to straddle his hips. The sound of fabric ripping registered in his brain just an instant before his wife\u2019s husky whisper: \u201cI can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d</p><p>Oh, thank God.</p><p>Toby scarcely recognized the woman tugging impatiently at his cravat, thrusting her tongue into his mouth, scraping her teeth along his jaw. Was this truly his solemn, saintly wife? She was frenzied with passion and desire. She wanted him, just as desperately as he wanted her. They were fighting to get closer, kiss deeper, expose more skin to press against hot, damp skin. They ceased the tussle just long enough to unite against the common enemy of her skirts, hiking yards of silk and petticoats up to her waist until the fabric settled around them in a shimmering cloud. He grasped her hips and pulled her feminine core flush against his aching erection. A fierce groan rose from his chest. Straightening her spine, Isabel rode him eagerly, rocking her hips against his hard length again and again. Even through the layers of his smalls and trousers, she felt warm and soft and absolutely amazing.</p><p>So. Damn. Good.</p><p>She leaned forward, grasping the seatback behind him for leverage. And now her breasts were thrust in his face with each rolling tilt of her hips. Yes, this passionate, lustful woman was indeed his wife. Toby would know these magnificent breasts anywhere. He pressed his face into her cleavage, inhaling deeply, then stroked over their exposed tops with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou taste of champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped, straightening in his lap and pulling her bosom out of his tongue\u2019s reach. His disappointment was short-lived, however, for she grasped her bodice in both hands and eased it downward, aiding the process with erotic, wriggling motions of her shoulders. \u201cYes, taste them. Touch them.\u201d</p><p>Her breasts finally sprang free, in all their bounteous, dark-tipped glory, and Toby thought he would spill in his trousers for the first time since the age of fifteen. He gratefully caressed, lifted, suckled, and she rode him faster, grinding her hips against his in a frantic rhythm. She gave a little cry, and he knew by the timbre of it that her peak was near. It was tempting to slide a hand between them and stroke her over the edge. Better yet, wrench open his fall and slide into her just at the moment she came. But instead he held back. This time, he didn\u2019t want to bring her to pleasure. He wanted to observe her as she pleasured herself. There was nothing more arousing than the feel of her riding him, the acceleration of her breath against his ear. He allowed her to set her own pace, learn the rhythm and pressure and precise angle that would send her into bliss.</p><p>She did it all on her own, his passionate lover, his beautiful wife. But as her climax rocked her, it was his name she called.</p><p>And that was when Toby knew himself to be the luckiest man on earth. Isabel was still quivering in his lap and breathing hard against his neck, when the carriage rolled to a halt. He helped her adjust her bodice and skirts as best she could, offering his coat for her modesty as they alighted from the coach. She ducked her head as they entered the house, avoiding the curious gaze of the servants. Toby sent them away with a pointed glance.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d she whispered as they entered the foyer, indicating the wine-stained, bedraggled condition of her gown. \u201cWhat a state I\u2019m in. Perhaps I should clean up, before ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore?\u201d he prompted, a grin spreading across his face.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d She blushed.</p><p>Toby thought about telling her that he rather liked her mussed and soiled, and what ever repairs she made to her appearance were likely to be undone in seconds ... but he supposed he could rein in his desire for a few more minutes, to indulge her feminine sensibilities. A very few. He pulled her close, thrusting the hard ridge of his arousal into her hip. \u201cHow long?\u201d he asked gruffly. \u201cHow long before you\u2019ll be ready for me?\u201d</p><p>She pulled away and gave him a coy, seductive smile. Good Lord, but he\u2019d done himself no favors, teaching this woman to tease.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d she said, fluttering her jet-black lashes. \u201cPerhaps fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinx.\u201d Toby lifted her into his arms and swept her into the nearest room with a door, which happened to be the blue parlor. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d</p><p>He kicked the door shut and pressed her against it, using one hand to lift her leg over his hip and working his way under her skirts with the other. The moment his fingertips found the slick warmth of her sex, there was no more coy conversation. There was only need\u2014mindless and intense. He needed to get inside her, and he needed to come. Ideally in that order. With shaking fingers, he unbuttoned his fall and freed his straining erection. She helped him, hooking her legs around his waist and tilting her hips to ease his way. He positioned himself and thrust, sinking straight into her moist heat with no resistance. His body came alive with bliss. Lifting her backside with both hands, he pistoned his hips, pounding her against the door again and again. He thrust fast and hard, shamelessly using her snug, willing body. Pursuing his own release just as selfishly as she\u2019d chased hers in the coach. And she loved it. She writhed and moaned in his arms, urging him on. Taking him deeper. Pulling him closer ... closer ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There.</p><p>A hoarse cry ripped from his throat as he came. He sagged against her, spent and weakened. But far from sated.</p><p>He rested his brow against her bare collarbone. Her skin was slick with perspiration\u2014his, hers. Theirs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished with you,\u201d he told her, digging his fingers into her hips. \u201cYou do know that, don\u2019t you? I\u2019m going to take you upstairs and strip you of every last stitch of clothing and have you in as many different ways as I please. In crude, animal ways that will turn you pale with shock and then pink with pleasure. And tomorrow, the beggars and foundlings of London will just have to fend for themselves, because my wife will be too exhausted to move.\u201d He raised his head and stared straight into her dark, almond-shaped eyes. \u201cWhat say you to that?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHow long will it take us to get upstairs?\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, Toby nuzzled the curve of her neck. \u201cI love you. My God, how I love you.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but say it. He couldn\u2019t hold it in a second longer. Her fingers stilled in his hair. \u201cOh, Toby. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. Don\u2019t speak, I beg you.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked at him.</p><p>Toby\u2019s heart pounded in his chest. This night had been so perfect. If she didn\u2019t love him in return, he didn\u2019t want to know. Not tonight. Heartbreak like that could wait for tomorrow ...</p><p>but tonight, he would embrace ignorance. If he wanted her to love him, the way that he loved her\u2014it seemed logical that he should first let her know how very much that was.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He smoothed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve never said those words before, to any woman. I\u2019ve never felt this before, for any woman. You\u2019re so rich with love, my darling. You give of yourself so freely to even the most undeserving wretches, and I include myself in that group. When it comes to love, I\u2019m but a pauper next to you, but even we paupers have our pride. Perhaps I have just this one coin to give, but I should like to watch it glitter a bit, before you go burying it under ten-pound notes like the generous angel you are. So for tonight, just... just listen. All right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, biting her lip.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, my heart. My own.\u201d He kissed her tenderly. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>Her fingers laced behind his neck. \u201cToby, take me to bed.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>As it turned out, Bel did find enough strength to move the following day. Eventually. Long after Toby had left for the hustings, she dragged herself from their rumpled bed. As she stretched, her body protested with pain. It was the sort of mild, dull ache one typically experienced the day following some strenuous exertion\u2014the muscles clinging to their memories of flexing, stretching, drawing taut. The ache ensured she would think of him and their passion, all day. It was not at all unpleasant.</p><p>She examined herself in the mirror, finding other ways in which he\u2019d marked her. Her fingers lingered over a berry-stain bruise at the crest of her right breast. No daring necklines for her today.</p><p>She found another small purpling mark, just below her nipple, and she remained there for several minutes, transfixed by its reflection.</p><p>It had been a long time since Bel had stood before a mirror thus, contemplating wounds inflicted by love. Not since she was a child. Bruises, scratches ... bite marks, on occasion\u2014her mother had given her all these, and more.</p><p>El amor es locura. Love is madness.</p><p>There had been so many good days. So many lovely hours spent in that quiet, sunlit room. Her mother would brush and plait her hair, all the while humming pleasant melodies and murmuring words of love and praise.</p> <p>It took only an instant for everything to change. It didn\u2019t matter how good she was, or how carefully she followed the rules. And Isabel knew, because she had tried hard\u2014so very hard\u2014</p><p>to be good. In the space of a heartbeat, the spit of a curse, the smack of a silver brush\u2014the madness would take hold. The madness would clutch at anything within reach: clothing, hair, flesh.</p><p>Then it would release its grip, just as quickly. So quickly, Bel could have imagined the whole feverish, violent episode to be only a dream, were there no bruises or marks to bear witness. But they hadn\u2019t been a dream, all those years of love twining inexorably with hurt. And last night hadn\u2019t been a dream, either. It had been a revelation.</p><p>Toby had wounded her, here\u2014her fingers drifted to her other breast\u2014and here. And this morning, she looked upon those marks without a trace of shame or self-loathing or fear. In fact, she found them thrilling.</p><p>Yes, he had marked her in a moment of wild, mindless passion, just as her mother had done. But these marks were different, so different. Everything was different. He\u2019d changed her life, this dear, sweet man who would never lie to her, never let her come to harm, who would risk his life to guard hers. With Toby, at last she felt safe.</p><p>Not only safe, but loved.</p><p>He loved her. How many times had he told her so, the night before? She\u2019d stopped counting at four. She might have\u2014now that she thought about it\u2014briefly lost consciousness at four. At any rate, it was clear that he\u2019d been wishing to say it for some time, and now she could expect to hear it quite often.</p><p>He loved her, and she loved him. And shouldn\u2019t life be wonderful now?</p><p>Perhaps it was the first whisper of madness speaking, but as Bel bathed and dressed, she began to believe it could be. Surely her heart was strong enough, surely her love was sufficiently deep. She could devote herself to both Toby and charity. Passion by night, good works by day. Why couldn\u2019t she have it all?</p><p>She found herself humming a theme from Don Giovanni as the carriage conveyed her to the printer\u2019s shop, where she retrieved two stacks of Society leaflets bound with twine. Bel scanned one with satisfaction. Augusta\u2019s clear prose described the plight of the climbing boys and articulated the argument in favor of replacing horrific child labor with grown men and modern machinery. And while Augusta\u2019s text appealed to the reader\u2019s reason, Sophia\u2019s deft illustrations pulled at the heart. Now it fell to her, as a lady of increasing social influence, to convert sympathy into action. That was the purpose of the demonstration Friday. And Bel\u2019s mission today, as befitted a lady of influence, was to issue personal invitations. It was time to pay a call on Aunt Camille. Otherwise known as Her Grace, the Duchess of Aldonbury.</p><p>The Duchess of Aldonbury was, as duchesses went, a rather minor one. She was not a royal duchess. Nevertheless, Aunt Camille held her own version of court. She hosted a ladies\u2019 card party on the third Wednesday of every month, and she guarded the invitations with every ounce of supercilious zeal her aristocratic rank allowed. Add to this the talent of a renowned Frenchtrained pastry chef, and each third Wednesday afternoon saw London\u2019s most elite and influential ladies converging on Her Grace\u2019s residence. To merit an invitation, one must bring a purse bursting with coin to wager and a quiver of witty rejoinders to amuse. Bel didn\u2019t meet either qualification, but she was family and therefore exempt.</p><p>When she entered the Roman-styled parlor, there were already nearly two dozen ladies in attendance, arranged in neat clusters of four. Sophia was seated at a table of whist players near the hearth. Bel exchanged a warm smile with her sister-in-law as she moved to greet her aunt.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Bel dipped in a graceful curtsy, and followed it with a warm kiss to the matron\u2019s rouged cheek. \u201cHow are you, Aunt Camille?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am well, child.\u201d Aunt Camille waved Bel to a seat and then promptly forgot her. Which suited Bel\u2019s purpose, because she was here to speak with everyone except Aunt Camille. Armed with a small clutch of leaflets, she approached a knot of ladies chatting by the tea service.</p><p>\u201cLady Violet, Mrs. Breckinridge,\u201d she greeted them brightly. The ladies turned to her with expressions of benign amusement. \u201cI\u2019m so delighted to see you. Did you receive my invitation to breakfast at Aldridge House, this Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I thought surely it was a joke,\u201d Lady Violet replied. \u201cBreakfast, at half-eight in the morning? Why, I\u2019m scarcely abed by five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only a breakfast,\u201d Bel said. \u201cThe meal will be followed by a demonstration, of an exciting innovation in house hold management. This is the reason for the early hour, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lady Violet gave her friend a speaking look. \u201cAn innovation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd an exciting one,\u201d Mrs. Breckinridge said with a smile. \u201cIt must be thrilling indeed, my dear. You\u2019re positively aglow. I should like to learn your secret.\u201d</p><p>The ladies tittered, and Bel\u2019s confidence wavered. Then she thought of Toby and lifted her chin. \u201cI do find it exciting,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a grave transgression being perpetrated on the helpless children of London, and we have the power to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough innovations in house hold management?\u201d Lady Violet looked dubious.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bel passed each of them one of her leaflets. \u201cAs a member of the Society for Obviating the Necessity of Climbing Boys, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an absurdly long name,\u201d opined Mrs. Breckinridge. \u201cWhy, it hardly fits on the leaflet.\u201d</p><p>Bel resisted the urge to roll her eyes. \u201cAs a member of the Society, I invite you to attend our demonstration this Friday. The practice of forcing small children to remove soot from flues is not only barbaric, but inefficient. As our demonstration will show, the proper cleaning of chimneys is a task that can only be performed satisfactorily by a grown man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA grown man.\u201d Lady Violet\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cDid I hear you correctly? Only the services of a grown man are satisfactory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, not any grown man ... he must have the proper equipment, of course.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Breckinridge looked on the verge of losing her mouthful of tea. She swallowed with apparent difficulty. \u201cBut of course. Tell me, Lady Aldridge, will your husband be a party to this demonstration? I think all the ladies of the ton have been curious regarding the state of Sir Toby\u2019s equipment. One has only to look at you to see his services are quite satisfactory.\u201d</p><p>Now Lady Violet choked on her biscuit.</p><p>Bel frowned, trying to imagine why these women would think Toby would be cleaning his own flues. \u201cWhy, my husband is currently occupied with the polling in Surrey. But if the election concludes early, perhaps he will attend. The demonstration itself will be performed by a chimney sweep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lady Violet murmured to her friend. \u201cShe has turned to the help already. And a chimney sweep, no less. Worse than a footman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a demonstration for gentlemen,\u201d Bel went on, ignoring the cryptic comment. \u201cThe power to change this deplorable situation rests within the female sex.\u201d She continued speaking over their giggles. Why did this strike them as so amusing? \u201cIt is a true mark of our modern age, when we, the ladies of English society, find ourselves in a position to exert influence over our husbands and effect social change.\u201d</p><p>Lady Violet struggled to compose her expression. \u201cAnd what position would that be, Lady Aldridge? For exerting influence over one\u2019s husband? Not supine, one supposes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed not. This is precisely my point. We must not take this injustice lying down.\u201d</p><p>The ladies collapsed into laughter. Bel wanted to growl with frustration. Why could she not make these women see? Were they purposefully misunderstanding her, or merely that obtuse?</p><p>And was it her passion-addled imagination, or did all of their barbs have a distinctly carnal implication?</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d she muttered, rising to her feet. Perhaps she would find a more sympathetic audience with the Countess of Vinterre across the parlor. \u201cI do hope you will be able to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we shall,\u201d Lady Violet said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world, Lady Aldridge. Friday promises the best amusement of the season.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It is not meant for your amusement, Bel longed to retort. It is for your edification, you silly, thoughtless wench.</p><p>Oh, heavens. Had that thought truly originated in her brain? She felt so queer, so out of sorts. She would have liked to blame her odd behavior on fatigue from the night before, but she suspected the lingering passion had more to do with it. Even staring at the illustration of poor, maltreated climbing boys, she could not muster her usual zeal. Instead, as she surveyed the assortment of wan ladies decorating the richly hued salon, all she could think was that she wanted to return home, return to bed. Return to Toby.</p><p>And worse, it was as though everyone in the room could sense it. Lady Violet\u2019s comments were only the beginning. From every corner of the room, the ladies stared at her, whispering to one another across the card table and laughing into their tea.</p> <p>\u201cBel.\u201d Sophia touched her elbow. \u201cThe air in here is so close, and with the baby\u201d\u2014she laid a hand over her abdomen in a universal gesture of incipient motherhood\u2014\u201cWill you take a turn with me, outside?\u201d</p><p>Bel nodded and followed her sister-in-law out the door and into the garden. The moment they rounded the corner of a hedge, Sophia turned to her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning\u2019s Prattler.\u201d</p><p>Bel shook her head. She avoided the rancid tabloid on principle, only bothering to glance at it when Toby needed soothing over another assault on his character. Why that paper had such a vendetta against her husband, she could not comprehend.</p> <p>Sophia withdrew a scrap of rolled newsprint from her reticule and extended it to Bel with one hand, taking the stack of leaflets in her other. \u201cI am so sorry to be the one to show you this. But after Lady Violet\u2019s comments inside ... I really thought you must be made aware. People will be talking.\u201d</p><p>Bel\u2019s stomach plummeted as she took the bit of paper and unrolled it cautiously. Had they linked Toby with another woman? She knew now that The Prattler grossly overstated his rakish exploits, and she believed that no rumor of infidelity would have a mite of truth. But still</p><p>\u2014it wounded her, to hear the gossip suggest he had already strayed. And as she took her first glance at the caricature, she thought indeed that was what the illustration implied. It depicted Toby with a loose woman on his arm, her clothing agape and one sleeve sliding from her shoulder. Her exaggerated breasts squeezed to the top of her bodice, overflowing her gown as she leaned against Toby\u2019s frame. The two figures were depicted in the dark of night, tripping down the stairs of a grand stone edifice. Bel peered closer. Why, it was the opera house!</p><p>She read the caption aloud. \u201cThe Rake Unrepentant. Is Sir Toby London\u2019s own Don Giovanni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bel,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Dread stirred in Bel\u2019s chest as she looked again at the loose woman draped over Toby\u2019s dashing form. For the first time she examined the face, instead of the voluptuous figure indecently spilling across the page. Black hair. Wide, dark eyes.</p> <p>\u201cOh, dear Lord.\u201d</p><p>It was her. She was the woman on Toby\u2019s arm, slavering over her own husband like a glassyeyed prostitute. Now Bel noticed the ribbons of speech attributed to these disgusting renditions of her and Toby. From his mouth: \u201cDid you really think to reform me?\u201d From her: \u201cLa! I never knew ruin was so sweet.\u201d</p><p>Behind them, in the shadows of the opera house, Mr. Hollyhurst had drawn a pair of underfed children, their hands out in an attitude of begging. Their pleas went unheeded.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Bel said numbly, rolling the paper again. \u201cThank you for showing me. It explains a great deal.\u201d No wonder the ladies inside had greeted her overtures with amusement, doubted her charitable intentions, taken all of her words as innuendo. This was their opinion of her: a lust-mad female, incited to depravity by her husband\u2019s rakish charm and dissolute example. And the worst of it was\u2014Bel worried that they were right. Mr. Hollyhurst, Lady Violet, Mrs. Breckinridge. Why would anyone draw such an image, or give credit to its implications, if it did not contain truth at its core? She thought of leaving the opera house last night, flushed and frenzied with desire\u2014too desperate even to wait until they returned home. Good heavens, she\u2019d thrown herself on him in the carriage! A respectable lady of influence didn\u2019t behave in such a manner. And had there truly been hungry children, huddling in the shadows in need of help, whom she had ignored in her passion-blinded state?</p><p>There could have been.</p><p>Who would look to such a woman for their moral direction? How could such a woman be the wife of an influential MP?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make overmuch of it,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cAs scandals go, desire for one\u2019s own husband is not much of one. Never mind Lady Violet\u2014she\u2019s just an old, embittered dragon. She can\u2019t help but breathe fire. She\u2019ll tire of teasing you quickly enough, if you refuse to give her the satisfaction of showing distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just Lady Violet. All London reads The Prattler.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, and there is a new issue printed each morning. Within a few days, people will find a new topic of gossip, and this will all have been forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\u201d But in a few days, the election would be over\u2014the demonstration, as well. And all of it could be ruined, because of her. Because she had allowed passion to overrule her principles. \u201cI...\u201d She choked back a wave of bile. \u201cI feel suddenly ill. I think I\u2019ll slip out by the garden path and make my way home. Please make my excuses to our aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Sophia stroked Bel\u2019s arm soothingly. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Bel forced a little smile. \u201cReally, this is nothing. I\u2019m just fatigued. I need to rest, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>After bidding Sophia good-bye, Bel made her way to the front of the residence. To make her failure complete, she ordered the carriage to simply return her home. She knew Toby would still be out, campaigning in Surrey. Perhaps she ought to complete her visits to distribute leaflets, or take supplies to the children\u2019s dispensary. But she didn\u2019t want to be near ladies or orphans right now. She wanted to be near Toby, in what ever way she could. She would cast off this fine, French-striped day dress and beribboned bonnet, put on one of her old, plain muslin shifts, and creep into the bed that might still be warm from their night of passion\u2014that might still retain some comforting hint of his scent. And then she might weep, or fitfully dream the day away, until he came home to hold her and love her.</p><p>Oh, she was weak indeed.</p><p>When she entered Aldridge House, she heard low, masculine voices down the hall. Her heart leapt. Was Toby home? Perhaps he\u2019d been laughed off the hustings in Surrey, if today\u2019s Prattler had reached the borough already. To her surprise, Bel didn\u2019t even care\u2014so long as he was here, with her.</p><p>On light feet, she hurried down the corridor. The voices seemed to be coming from Toby\u2019s library. Nearing the door, she recognized the warm timbre of her husband\u2019s voice. It was him. Thank heaven. Toby would make everything better. Toby loved her. He would never let her come to harm. With him, she was safe.</p><p>As she put a hand to the door handle, it dimly registered in her mind that Toby was not just speaking, but shouting. Bellowing, really, as she\u2019d never heard him raise his voice to anyone.</p><p>\u201cYou had clear instructions,\u201d he thundered. \u201cShe was never to be a part of this.\u201d</p><p>A milder tenor answered. Bel had to press her ear to the door to make out the words. Her conscience pricked her for eavesdropping, but how else was she to discern if it was safe to interrupt?</p><p>\u201cYes, but it wasn\u2019t working,\u201d the milder voice argued back. \u201cYou told me to be more severe, do my worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour worst at me, not her,\u201d Toby answered. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd didn\u2019t you tell me you wanted to lose, at any cost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it had to be her. There\u2019s nothing left to insinuate about you. That\u2019s how I reasoned it, at least.\u201d</p><p>A loud crack reverberated through the door, startling Bel. Her stomach plummeted with the weight of dread. Perhaps she should summon a footman.</p><p>Toby\u2019s voice again. \u201cDamn you, Hollyhurst, you\u2019re not paid to reason. You\u2019re paid to draw.\u201d</p><p>Hollyhurst? Was that vile man here, in Toby\u2019s study?</p><p>Bel didn\u2019t recall making the decision to open the door. The next thing she knew, she was standing in the center of the Aldridge crest stamped in gold on the blood-red carpet. The men stared at her; Toby from behind his desk, and\u2014could this truly be the H. M. Hollyhurst, reclining in the chair opposite? He wasn\u2019t at all the grizzled, pointy-eared troll she\u2019d imagined him to be. He was barely older than she, Bel judged\u2014smooth-faced and handsome. Pale with shock, the young man rose to his feet. \u201cBollocks,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cToby?\u201d Bel\u2019s voice shook. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Toby knew precisely what was going on. This ill-fated day was gathering to its horrific climax. The jig was up. This was the moment he\u2019d been dreading ever since the day they married. And yet, there came with it an odd sense of relief.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, may I introduce Mr. Hiram Hollyhurst?\u201d The anemic twit bowed clumsily. Toby added with a pointed look, \u201cHe\u2019s leaving.\u201d</p><p>Hollyhurst was not so obtuse that he missed that hint. Isabel stood frozen in the center of the carpet, staring at Toby in disbelief for long moments after the door had been closed and they were alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Her jaw worked. \u201cToby, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Of course she didn\u2019t, the sweet girl. She could never understand the motivations behind such callous behavior. It simply wasn\u2019t in her to comprehend. \u201cWill you sit down?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThank you, no.\u201d She clasped and unclasped her hands, as though unsure how to begin. \u201cSo that was Mr. Hollyhurst.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question. Which was fortunate, because Toby really did not want to answer. What he wanted to do was hold her. After all that had happened this morning, the news he had just received\u2014how cruel, that he should destroy his marriage on this, the day he most needed the comfort of a wife.</p><p>\u201cThe Mr. Hollyhurst,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe same man who has vilified you in The Prattler all these months by drawing those horrid caricatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWe\u2019re ... friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d she cried. \u201cBut how can that be? However could you become friends with a man like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the son of a former steward, and ... and it\u2019s not important how we met.\u201d Toby paused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been paying him, Isabel. All those caricatures, the assaults on my character\u2014they were all created at my behest.\u201d</p><p>She made an inarticulate noise in her throat. Her eyes then slid toward the ceiling, as though some explanation for his behavior might be found in the scrolls of the brass chandelier. A silent</p><p>\u201cwhy\u201d formed on her pursed lips, but she seemed to lack the breath to dislodge it.</p><p>\u201cReally, please sit down.\u201d Toby moved toward her and laid a hand on her arm. She shook it off. \u201cThank you, no.\u201d Still, she could not form the question. He sighed. He would not force her to ask. \u201cIt began last year, after Sophia disappeared and her parents spread the falsehood about her illness. It was winter, and people had little enough to talk about. The gossips would out the truth inevitably, I feared\u2014unless I gave them something else to discuss. I came to London and tracked down Hollyhurst. Hiram and I devised this</p><p>\u2018Rake Reborn\u2019 nonsense.\u201d</p><p>Toby moved toward the bar. God, he needed a drink. \u201cAt first, I simply meant to deflect suspicion, absorb the brunt of the scandal,\u201d he continued, pouring whiskey into a glass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShould Sophia miraculously return and still wish to marry me, her reputation would be intact. Later, when it became clear she wasn\u2019t returning ... then I suppose it became a matter of pride. I didn\u2019t want anyone to know why she\u2019d truly jilted me. Hell, even I didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d truly jilted me. Far preferable to let people suppose my dissolute behavior drove her to cry off.\u201d</p><p>At last, Isabel found her voice. \u201cBut why continue it, even after we became engaged? After we married?\u201d</p><p>Toby took a slow draught of whiskey, allowing her time to piece the reasons together. He knew she would. She was a clever girl.</p> <p>When he lowered his glass, she was frowning down at her hands. See? Hadn\u2019t taken her but seconds.</p><p>She said, \u201cMr. Hollyhurst mentioned a plan, to lose. Was he referring to the election?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been trying to lose?\u201d</p><p>Toby felt like telling her it was more that he\u2019d been trying not to win\u2014but that would be mincing words. Anyway, it scarcely mattered, given the morning\u2019s events. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the campaigning, the hustings\u2014you\u2019ve been going to Surrey every day.\u201d</p><p>Toby shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cDear Lord. You haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>A look of revulsion formed on her face, and it nearly killed him to view it. But he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to turn away.</p><p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t been going to Surrey,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhere have you been spending your days?</p><p>Not... Oh, heavens. Not at the Hidden Pearl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cNever there, nor anywhere like it. I went... different places. The park, the club. Much of the time, I was simply here in my study. I half-expected\u2014half-hoped, I think</p><p>\u2014you\u2019d one day discover me, and the ruse would be over. But you\u2019re always so occupied with your charitable efforts, your society meetings ...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou never noticed I was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t notice you! Why would I go searching the house for my husband, when he\u2019s supposedly off in Surrey? I believed in you. I trusted you. I thought you wanted this, as much as I did. Even before our wedding, from the first night we met, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now, Isabel. Be honest. You know I never truly wanted to run for MP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I thought you wanted me!\u201d She brought a hand to her throat, as if astounded by the volume of her own anger. \u201cEven if politics wasn\u2019t your inclination, you knew I sought a husband with influence in Parliament. And before we were married, you promised to run. You promised me, Toby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised you many things, darling. The promises came to me easily then, when I had no real intention of keeping them.\u201d Toby took a deep breath and put down his glass. There was no going back now. Half-confessions served no purpose. It was time to lay the truth out before her, and let her do with it what she would.</p><p>\u201cWhen we first became engaged,\u201d he continued in an even tone, \u201cI would have told you anything you wanted to hear\u2014tales, fancies, lies. I simply had to make you mine, by any means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPride,\u201d he said in a matter-of-fact tone. \u201cAnd some juvenile form of retribution. I wanted to take you from Gray the way he\u2019d taken Sophia from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia?\u201d Her hand dropped from her throat to her stomach, and she looked as though she might be sick. \u201cAll this time, it was about her? You never wanted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true.\u201d Toby rushed forward, catching her in his arms. She tried to pull away, but he held her firmly. \u201cIsabel, I wanted you from the first, before I even learned your name. And once I knew you for the intelligent, principled, passionate woman you are, I fell in love with you, body and soul. By the time we married, I wanted nothing more than to keep you happy. But by then I\u2019d made you so many absurd promises, and you had this na\u00efve, idealized impression of my character. At first, I wanted to earn that good opinion. I wanted to deserve you. And I thought maybe, if I just tried hard enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first.\u201d She refused to look at him, staring instead at his lapel. \u201cAt first, you wanted to earn my good opinion. But not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t.\u201d Toby\u2019s mouth went dry. \u201cI just don\u2019t have it in me. To be truthful, I\u2019m not sure any man would. Your expectations are so high. I knew I\u2019d inevitably disappoint you\u2014if it wasn\u2019t by losing this election, it would be by losing the next, or by failing to gain the level of influence you desired ... Sooner or later, I knew you\u2019d learn the truth. I\u2019m not the man you\u2019d wish me to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could be that man. With a bit more time, if you only made the effort. You have so much potential. Such warmth, such compassion, a natural gift for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Just stop.\u201d Toby released her and raised a hand to his temple. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I could be, with just a bit of improvement. I\u2019m not one of your blasted charity projects, I\u2019m your husband. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not enough for me anymore, to earn your good opinion. I want your love, whether I deserve it or not.\u201d</p><p>She choked back a sob. \u201cYou lied to me. The campaign, the opera, Mr. Hollyhurst... and now this.\u201d Fumbling with the pursestring, she opened her reticule and withdrew a scrap of paper.</p><p>\u201cLook at this. Just look at it.\u201d</p><p>She waved the caricature under his nose. Toby didn\u2019t need to look at it\u2014the horrid image was burned into his memory.</p><p>Mimicking his voice, she continued, \u201c\u2018Let me take you to the opera,\u2019 you said. \u2018Let me spoil you,\u2019 you said. \u2018If you want to be a lady of influence, you must appear beautiful, desirable, au courant.\u2019 And look at me in this horrid drawing\u2014depraved, disgusting, mad with lust. Who would listen to that woman, I ask you? What kind of influence can I have now?\u201d She balled the paper in her hands and threw it at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me a public joke. You\u2019ve ruined everything. If you really loved me, how could you do this? You ... you liar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel\u2014\u201d</p><p>With an open palm, she buffeted his shoulder. \u201cYou told me you would never hurt me. You said you would die before you let me come to harm.\u201d She hit him again. \u201cYou made me trust you, you ...\u201d</p><p>She unleashed a series of epithets in Spanish. From the tenor of them, Toby was glad he could not understand their meaning. She punctuated each insult with a blow to his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastardo!\u201d she cried, striking him again.</p><p>That one, he understood. And accepted as his due.</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d she cried again, pulling back her arm.</p><p>He caught her wrist before she could land another blow. \u201cIsabel.\u201d</p><p>Breathing hard, she stared at her hand with disbelief. The anger in her eyes cooled to shock. Finally she whispered, \u201cI struck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve never struck anyone in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could tell you it didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Gentling his grip, he folded both her hands in his and held them tight. Almost the same way they\u2019d stood as they\u2019d recited holy vows. Together they paused there, just breathing. Holding disaster at bay for a few moments more. Her bottom lip trembled. It gutted him, that he didn\u2019t feel he had the right to kiss it.</p><p>\u201cI went to my aunt\u2019s card party this morning,\u201d she said quietly, staring at their hands. \u201cThe ladies there ... they were all laughing at me, whispering about me in the corners. And then Sophia showed me that picture of me, crazed and disheveled. Just like my poor mother. No one listened to her, either. You can\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve worked, how hard I\u2019ve tried to never be that woman. This woman.\u201d Her voice cracked, and Toby\u2019s heart cracked with it. \u201cI wanted their respect, and they all laughed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, I\u2019m sorry. So sorry. But every lady in England could laugh at you, and I would love you still. And I\u2019d gladly endure the derision of the world, if you could feel the same for me.\u201d</p><p>It was true. All his life, Toby had been happy to be every man\u2019s friend. But it wasn\u2019t enough anymore, to be that fellow everyone liked. He wanted to be the man one woman loved, beyond reason.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, this is who I am. I\u2019m a flawed, self-absorbed aristocrat of middling consequence. I enjoy my life, my friends, and my family. I like to have a good time, and I like to surround myself with nice things. Much as I admire your zeal for charity, I doubt I\u2019ll ever match it. I have no interest in Parliament and accordingly little talent for politics. I am deeply, deeply sorry to have hurt you, but I\u2019ll spend a lifetime making it right if only you\u2019ll give me the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>She struggled against his grip. \u201cYou would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel, please.\u201d Desperation frayed his voice. \u201cGive me one moment. Afterward, I promise you, you may strike, insult, and berate me as much as you wish. I know I deserve it. But for just this one moment, pretend with me that this morning never happened. Pretend the lies were never spoken. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>He waited until she did.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he repeated slowly, \u201cfor just this moment, and see me for the man I truly am. And know that I love you, more than I can express. More than I can comprehend. Can that be enough for you?\u201d His heart climbed into his throat, and he swallowed hard around it. He needed to ask. \u201cIsabel, can I be enough for you?\u201d</p><p>Tears slid down her cheeks. Impossible to say whether despair or joy propelled them. Blast those enigmatic female tears.</p><p>She said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you ask of me.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands to her face and cupped it roughly. \u201cYes, I do. I\u2019m asking you to love me, the way that I love you.\u201d He kissed her lips, needing to taste her. More tears escaped her trembling eyelids. \u201cCompletely,\u201d he said, kissing her cheek, then her jaw, her ear. \u201cUnreservedly, passionately, madly ...\u201d</p><p>Her body went rigid in his arms, and she made a strange sound in her throat. Planting her hands on his chest, she pushed away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Toby. Last night, I thought perhaps I... but now you\u2019ve ...\u201d She shook her head and turned away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>And there it was. The verdict he\u2019d been dreading. She didn\u2019t love him. At least, not the way he loved her. Perhaps she loved him in some dutiful, selfless, Christian way. But she did not live and breathe and burn for him, the way he lived and breathed and burned for her. Very well, then. Now he knew.</p><p>And look, the world even kept turning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she repeated weakly.</p><p>\u201cStop apologizing. The fault is entirely mine. I understand.\u201d</p><p>Awkward silence blanketed the room.</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t keep you,\u201d he said, clearing his throat and stepping back around the desk. As he walked, his step faltered slightly. He felt off-balance, as though he were learning to walk with a javelin skewering his chest. \u201cI know you\u2019re busy. You must have some kind of meeting or appointment to keep. But before you go, I have something to tell you.\u201d He picked up the urgent message he\u2019d received that morning, fingered the broken wax seal. How odd, to think he\u2019d read it just hours ago.</p><p>\u201cMr. Yorke died last night,\u201d he said. \u201cOr perhaps early this morning. I\u2019m not sure. At any rate, he was here in Town, and he has no close family ...\u201d Toby made a fist and propped it on the chair\u2019s back. \u201cHad no close family. My mother and I will accompany his body back to Surrey, for the burial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Toby.\u201d</p><p>She came toward him, and he turned to look out the window. It was a revoltingly sunny day. Isabel stopped a few paces away. \u201cToby, I\u2019m so sorry.

It wasn\u2019t until today that I realized ... Yorke was the closest thing to a father I ever had.\u201d</p><p>She made a soft, soothing noise and reached for his hand.</p><p>He pulled it away, folding his arms over his chest. Of course, now she would comfort him. She could shower him in sweet, generous affection now, when he was down and plainly hurting and as wretched as some leper in a parable. Isabel had no shortage of pity to offer him. It was only the deep, abiding passion that he was denied.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have everything you wanted now,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll be the MP. You\u2019ll be Lady Aldridge, the influential MP\u2019s wife. This house is yours, to host as many demonstrations and</p><p>Society meetings and social functions as you please. Turn it into a home for foundlings, if you wish. I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll be in Surrey for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ... you\u2019re just leaving me here?\u201d</p><p>Her tone was wounded.</p><p>Good. Petty though it might be, he wanted to hurt her. To inflict just a fraction of the pain she\u2019d caused him.</p> <p>\u201cDid you have some better plan?\u201d Toby walked around her, crossing to the doorway. \u201cForgive me, but I really must be off to Yorke\u2019s town house. There\u2019s a sort of gathering, and I promised my mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your poor mother.\u201d Suddenly she flew across the carpet to stand before him, latching one hand over his arm. \u201cToby, let me come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Surrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I meant to the town house.\u201d Her brow wrinkled. \u201cI mean, I do have the demonstration Friday. The invitations have already gone out. I must be here in Town for that, I couldn\u2019t possibly cancel it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly. I understand you perfectly, Isabel. You\u2019re under no obligation to come with me to Yorke\u2019s house, nor to Surrey ...\u201d He gave her what he hoped was a cold, unfeeling look. \u201cI\u2019m certain we\u2019ll see one another soon enough.\u201d He turned to leave.</p><p>She dodged around him, blocking the door. \u201cToby, please. I can see how you\u2019re hurting. I want to help. Let me go with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated firmly, walking past her to exit the room. \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome. This is a family matter, not a charity event.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Toby had been an infant when his father died. He had no memory of the man, nor any recollection of his mother in her year of mourning. When she referred to Sir James Aldridge she did so in respectful, dispassionate tones\u2014and always in past tense. By all appearances, the dowager Lady Aldridge maintained a cordial relationship with her late husband\u2019s memory.</p><p>\u201cCordial\u201d had never described her relationship with Mr. Yorke. The two had argued over one thing or another\u2014and yet another\u2014for as long as Toby could remember. They made cutting remarks to one another\u2019s faces and said worse behind each other\u2019s backs. By all appearances, they were equally matched in only one respect\u2014mutual dislike.</p><p>And never, until this day, had Toby realized the obvious.</p><p>They had been in love.</p> <p>How had he missed it? Toby prided himself on his keen understanding of women, but as it turned out, he had a blind spot of mother-sized proportions. But then, she\u2019d never been \u201ca woman\u201d to him, because she was his mother and he\u2019d never looked for her vulnerabilities. He hadn\u2019t wanted to see them. She was his only parent, the rock of their family, the strongest person he knew.</p><p>But not today. Today, she was a pale, teary shambles.</p><p>\u201cMother, why did you never tell me?\u201d Toby sat at her side, holding one of her hands while she pressed a handkerchief to her eyes with the other. The two of them were tucked away in the corner of Mr. Yorke\u2019s parlor. The room was filled with visitors, come to pay their respects before his body was taken to Surrey. People came and went, seemingly at a loss as to where to direct their condolences, considering the deceased\u2019s lack of immediate family. His mother wiped her eyes and whispered, \u201cShould I have told you about my lover? Really, Toby, I know we are close. But there are some conversations a mother does not wish to have with her son.\u201d</p><p>She had a point there. \u201cHow long had you been ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecades.\u201d</p><p>Decades. Toby frowned at the carpet, trying to decide whether he wished to know how many.</p><p>\u201cNot for that long,\u201d she said, reading his thoughts. \u201cI was never unfaithful to your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no memory of my father,\u201d he said. He glanced up, toward the bedchamber above-stairs where Yorke\u2019s body lay. \u201cAll my memories are of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved you, Toby. He told me he would have left his estate to you, were it not entailed. I know he thought of you as the son he never had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not the son he did have? Why did the two of you never marry?\u201d</p><p>His mother shook her head. \u201cWe would have killed each other, had we lived under the same roof. No, I was accustomed to my independence, and we were both simply too stubborn.\u201d She released Toby\u2019s hand and blew her nose. \u201cHis health had been failing for some time. The doctors told him to slow down. For years, I begged him to resign his seat in Parliament, but the mule-headed man wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been after me to run against him?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cMother, you should have just told me the truth. I would have\u2014\u201d Toby clapped his mouth shut. There was no way to complete that sentence without indicting himself as a complete and total fraud. I would have kept the spirit of my promises. I would have accepted the duty that accompanies my fortunate birth. I would have put someone else\u2019s needs above my own, for a change. All things he should have done, regardless.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should have told you,\u201d his mother said. \u201cBut again, there\u2019s that uncomfortable matter of discussing one\u2019s lover with one\u2019s son. At any rate, he came around in the end. He told me just last week, he\u2019d decided to let you win. You were ready now, he said. He thought you and Isabel made a good team ... something about lambs.\u201d</p><p>Toby felt a pinch in his chest. So that was why the polls remained so close, and why Yorke had been in Town the other day. Toby had been right\u2014the old man hadn\u2019t been campaigning at all.</p><p>Just then, Jeremy entered the room, accompanied by Miss Osborne. Toby stood to greet them.</p><p>\u201cJem, Miss Osborne. Good of you to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just received the news,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cLucy wanted to join us, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course she couldn\u2019t,\u201d Toby replied. \u201cNot with a week-old infant at home. How is little Thomas Henry Trescott, the fifth Viscount Warrington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving up to his aristocratic lineage,\u201d Miss Osborne answered. \u201cHe has the whole house hold at his beck and call already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t claim to be surprised,\u201d Toby said with a smile. He indicated chairs nearby and invited them to sit. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad Mr. Yorke no family?\u201d Miss Osborne asked, scanning the room, presumably for black armbands or mourning gowns.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toby replied. \u201cNo close family, at any rate. There are some cousins, I believe, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had us. We\u2019re his family,\u201d Toby\u2019s mother interrupted, beginning to cry anew. \u201cDon\u2019t make it sound as though he was alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course he wasn\u2019t.\u201d Toby grasped her hand again. To Jeremy and Miss Osborne, he explained, \u201cOur families have always been close. He and mother were ... good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were lovers,\u201d she said, impatiently wiping her tears. When the other three simply stared at her, she said to Toby, \u201cI\u2019m an old woman, and now he\u2019s dead. It doesn\u2019t matter who knows. We were lovers.\u201d</p><p>And now Jeremy and Miss Osborne stared anywhere but at her. His mother\u2019s outburst, however, would not be subdued. What ever dam she\u2019d built to restrain her grief had cracked, and a tide of emotion flowed forth.</p><p>\u201cYou were right, Toby. I should have married him. He asked me, you know. So many times, but I always refused. And now\u201d\u2014her speech caught on a sob\u2014\u201cnow I\u2019ve no right to claim him. I\u2019ve no right to wear mourning for him, no right to be buried next to him. No right to go upstairs and make certain his valet dresses him in his green striped waistcoat, not that horrid blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, please don\u2019t cry,\u201d Toby said. \u201cI... I\u2019ll speak to his valet.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. Of all the lame attempts at comfort. His mother was falling to pieces before his eyes, and Toby hadn\u2019t the slightest clue how to hold her together. Normally, this was his forte, making women feel better. Ladies crossed ballrooms, streets, even lines of propriety just to exchange a few words with him, because they all knew: a girl could always depend on Sir Toby Aldridge to put a smile on her face.</p><p>Suddenly, he\u2019d lost the gift. Because now he knew: A girl shouldn\u2019t depend on Sir Toby Aldridge for anything. Any trust his wife had in him had vanished the moment she saw him for his true self. His own mother had been keeping secrets from him for decades. He wanted to soothe her, make her feel better, but he didn\u2019t know how anymore. It was a talent built on a cornerstone of arrogance, and this wretched day had knocked the foundation straight out from under him.</p><p>He spied Reginald entering the room. Behind him trailed Joss. Toby rose to his feet again, whispering, \u201cMother, Reginald is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, let him know, too,\u201d his mother said, wringing her handkerchief. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Yorke\u2019s dead, and nothing matters anymore.\u201d She broke into tears, listing sideways until her head came to rest on Miss Osborne\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>The young woman\u2019s eyes widened in alarm. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d she asked Toby, gesturing discreetly toward the matron wetting her sleeve with tears.</p><p>Toby had no advice to offer her, only a helpless shrug. He\u2019d never seen his mother in such a state. Ever.</p><p>Having picked his way through the crowd, Reginald finally reached Toby\u2019s side. \u201cAugusta sent a note to my offices. Yorke, gone. What a damned shame.\u201d He cast a glance toward Toby\u2019s mother. \u201cTaking it hard, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently they were close,\u201d said Toby.</p><p>\u201cWe were lovers,\u201d his mother cried, pressing her face further into Miss Osborne\u2019s shoulder. Raising his eyebrows, Reginald whistled quietly through his teeth. \u201cWell.\u201d</p><p>It was the greatest display of shock Toby had ever seen him make.</p><p>Miss Osborne raised a hand to the older woman\u2019s shoulder and gave her an awkward pat.</p><p>\u201cThere, there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHullo, Joss.\u201d Toby nodded at his brother-in-law, who stood a pace behind Reginald, looking every bit as uncomfortable as Toby felt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to intrude,\u201d Joss replied. \u201cI was at Mr. Tolliver\u2019s offices when the notice arrived, and I thought to pay my respects.\u201d He looked toward the women huddled on the divan. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d Toby said. \u201cNo one realized. It was good of you to come.\u201d</p><p>His mother began to sob. Miss Osborne stiffened.</p><p>\u201cIs that Montcrief at the door?\u201d Jeremy asked hopefully. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to speak with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toby snapped, cutting off his friend\u2019s path of retreat. Not that he could blame Jeremy for trying. He\u2019d escape the scene, too, if he could. It was hell, sitting here, feeling the loss of his friend and his wife in one morning, watching the pillar of strength who\u2019d supported his home, his family, his life, dissolving in abject grief. Knowing he could have\u2014should have\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>prevented it all. In all his life as a pampered child, a directionless youth, a pleasure-seeking gentleman of leisure\u2014Toby had never felt so utterly worthless.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know how he died,\u201d his mother cried, her words muffled by the fabric of Miss Osborne\u2019s sleeve. Reginald offered her a fresh handkerchief, which she accepted blindly.</p><p>\u201cThey say some kind of apoplexy, but the doctor won\u2019t talk to me. Was it painful? Did he suffer? I can\u2019t bear it, the thought of him dying here alone, in his bed ...\u201d She sobbed again.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too horrible to contemplate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was apoplexy,\u201d Miss Osborne said quietly, \u201cand it happened in his sleep ... he likely suffered no pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you to say, dear. But if you\u2019ll forgive me for saying so, I would feel more assured if that came from his physician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a physician,\u201d Joss said.</p><p>\u201cWhat Captain Grayson means to say,\u201d Miss Osborne explained, sparing Joss only the briefest of glances, \u201cis that I\u2019ve received a great deal of medical training and experience by virtue of being a doctor\u2019s daughter. But what I tell you now, I learned as a child. My mother suffered an apoplexy when I was a girl\u2014a severe one. She survived, but the attack left her paralyzed and bedridden, unable to walk or speak. Over the next year, she suffered many spells.\u201d She swallowed hard before continuing. \u201cI always sat with her, you see, while my father was working. I would read aloud, work my lessons, spoon her tea and broth. Her fits were difficult to even recognize at first. It almost looked as though she were asleep, in the midst of a dream. She would tremble a bit. Her breathing went agitated, and her eyelids fluttered against her cheeks. Afterward, she would be weakened and perhaps a bit scared, but not in pain. Never in pain.\u201d</p> <p>No one spoke. Toby was certain it was because they were all thinking the same, unspeakable thing. Thank God Mr. Yorke had gone quickly and not remained clinging to life in a useless, wasting shell. What a tragedy that would have been\u2014not just for Yorke to live through, but for his mother to witness. To imagine a young girl, forced to become caretaker to her own parent</p><p>No, no one had much to say to that.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t suffer, then?\u201d Lady Aldridge asked weakly. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Miss Osborne answered, her voice growing warm and soft. \u201cI was there with my mother, when she died. She went peacefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am glad of it, for her sake. And yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d A voice from the periphery pierced their bubble of silence. \u201cMother, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>Heads lifted. Augusta had arrived, bringing with her a fresh reserve of womanly efficiency. Toby absorbed the accompanying wave of relief. He gratefully moved aside, offering his sister the seat beside their mother.</p><p>\u201cOh, Augusta.\u201d The older woman slid from Miss Osborne\u2019s shoulder to meet the waiting embrace of her daughter. \u201cAugusta, I loved him.\u201d</p><p>Augusta soothed her, with soft touches and soft words. Mumbling some excuse, Miss Osborne bolted from the room. A heartbeat later, Joss followed her, leaving Reginald and Jeremy to make strained conversation amongst themselves.</p><p>And Toby just stood there, alone.</p><p>Hetta lurched from the room, pausing in the foyer to borrow strength from the carved walnut banister. Clinging to it with both hands, she bowed her head to her sleeve and wept. Noisily. She wished she could have made it a bit further away before breaking down, rather than dissolving in tears six feet from the parlor door. She wished the emotion tearing her to pieces were a more altruistic empathy for Lady Aldridge in her time of mourning, or grief for her own long-dead mother\u2014but it wasn\u2019t. It was envy, mixed with fear. Envy for anyone who knew the comfort of lasting affection. Fear that she would live her whole life and grow into an old woman with no one to mourn.</p><p>And no one to mourn her.</p><p>Strong hands gripped her shoulders. Every muscle in her body tensed.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she choked out, without lifting her head from her sleeve. She didn\u2019t need to look up. She knew who it was.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d came the predictably contrarian reply. \u201cNo, you need to be held. I\u2019m going to hold you.\u201d</p><p>There was no fight left in her, no more pride in the way. A word, an embrace\u2014whatever scrap of affection he offered her, she would gratefully accept. The strong hands turned her away from the banister, and then strong arms folded her into his chest.</p><p>She burrowed her face into his coat and sobbed. \u201cOh, Joss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. It\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>His hand went to her hair, stroking and soothing. As no one had soothed her in a very long time, since before her mother took ill. He released her name as a deep, soulful sigh, and his whole body relaxed, making a soft place for her. She breathed deeply, too, inhaling the comforting scents of clean linen and masculine spice.</p><p>He murmured comforting words as she wept, and Hetta tried desperately to stem the flow of her tears, so she might hear them.</p><p>\u201cWhat you said to Lady Aldridge ... it was brave of you, Hetta. I know it wasn\u2019t easy, but you gave her some peace.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed again, and he held her tight.</p><p>\u201cWhat an ass I\u2019ve been,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve treated you so ill. Can you ever forgive me? I know I don\u2019t deserve to be forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were right,\u201d she said, wiping at her eyes. She was only too glad to share the blame for their arguments. Perhaps now they could be friends. \u201cI know I should be more feeling with my patients, with their families, but...\u201d She made an impatient gesture with her hands, indicating her red, swollen eyes. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult. Just look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am looking at you.\u201d</p><p>He thrust a finger under her chin and tilted her face to his. Oh, how unfair that he should be so composed and handsome when she was a teary disgrace.</p><p>\u201cI am looking at you,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand I can scarcely understand\u2014how can this tiny, delicate woman possess so much strength, so much intelligence and courage?\u201d His hand lifted to her cheek, brushing away a tear. \u201cAll this, and such lovely eyes.\u201d</p><p>No. Surely he wouldn\u2019t be so cruel as to tease her again.</p><p>His hand caught her chin. \u201cNo, don\u2019t dare look away now. Do you know how those eyes have haunted me?\u201d</p><p>Hetta shook her head, suddenly afraid to blink.</p><p>The corner of his mouth curved. \u201cAt first they annoyed me, no end. They were always staring at me, asking me questions I didn\u2019t want to answer. Then I found myself wanting to stare back, ask questions of my own, and that irritated me even more. Then Bel recovered, and suddenly you weren\u2019t coming around anymore, and I found myself\u201d\u2014he sighed heavily\u2014\u201cmissing them. Intensely. That made me angriest of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you felt disloyal to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d His arm tightened around her waist. \u201cBecause I felt alive. Suddenly, painfully alive, when I\u2019d invested so much time and effort, making myself dead to the world. Because I began to yearn for things I swore I\u2019d never seek again. You can\u2019t know how I resented you for it.\u201d</p><p>She choked on a laugh. \u201cI think I have some idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do, to my shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought you a curiosity,\u201d she told him, needing him to understand. \u201cI tried not to stare at you, really I did. But you\u2019re so handsome and attractive and ... and I just couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side. \u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>Hetta held her breath, waiting. Then she said, \u201cI hate it when you say that, with that smug, enigmatic expression! I don\u2019t know what it means, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d His thumb covered her lips, then brushed over them in a tender caress. \u201cIt means I\u2019m going to kiss you now. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>And he did. He kissed her gently, sweetly\u2014and then Hetta kissed him back, with every ounce of passion she possessed. She felt uncertain and vulnerable and suspected she was doing everything wrong\u2014but since she\u2019d reached the age of three-and-twenty before receiving her first kiss, and since her first kiss stood an excellent chance of also being her last, she wasn\u2019t about to hold anything back.</p><p>When his hand fisted in the back of her gown and a little growl rumbled through his chest, she hoped it meant she\u2019d done something right.</p><p>And then it was over, and he held her in his arms again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trembling,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her tight. \u201cDon\u2019t be. I mean to marry you, Hetta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re worried what people will say. I know it wouldn\u2019t be easy, but we\u2019re both of us accustomed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, of course it\u2019s not that.\u201d Pulling away, she met his questioning gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re very kind, Joss, but you don\u2019t have to offer. I\u2019m not expecting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kind in the least. I know I don\u2019t have to. I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Tears pricked at her eyes again. \u201cBut you can\u2019t possibly want to marry me. I\u2019ve no money, for one thing. I\u2019m prickly and preoccupied, for another. I won\u2019t give up medicine. I\u2019d make a terrible wife. And you have a child ...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea what to do with a child, once the cord is cut. I\u2019d make a horrid mother.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it you only laugh when you\u2019re laughing at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you\u2019d better marry me, Hetta. Or I may never laugh again.\u201d He planted a quick kiss on her lips. \u201cFirst, I couldn\u2019t give two straws whether you have a dowry. I\u2019d never ask you to give up medicine, or anything that meant so much to you. And I\u2019m certain you would make a terrible housekeeper, and a perfectly horrid nursemaid. But I don\u2019t need either of those. My son needs a mother who believes he can do anything, who won\u2019t accept the restrictions society will place on him. And as for me ... I hardly know how to put words to what I need, but I know I\u2019m holding it here in my arms. I need not just a wife, but a partner. A strong, intelligent woman who expects no less of me than I expect of myself. I need to laugh, and often. And you need all those things, too.\u201d</p><p>Hetta stared numbly at his cravat.</p><p>\u201cI need to love,\u201d he said quietly, gathering her to his chest. His heartbeat pounded against her cheek. \u201cAnd be loved. Do you think you could love me, Hetta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I already do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, then.\u201d His chin settled on her head. \u201cAnd now for the trickier part. Can you allow me to love you?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI think so. Yes.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss to the crown of her head, and she felt his wide smile. \u201cThere now,\u201d he teased. \u201cWas that so hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was terrifying.\u201d</p><p>He held her tight. \u201cI know, my dear. I know.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>It was nearly dark by the time Toby left Yorke\u2019s townhouse. After seeing his mother into the keeping of Augusta and Reginald, playing impromptu host to a parade of mourners, and speaking with Yorke\u2019s valet\u2014about the waistcoat, among other arrangements\u2014he finally made his way to the carriage.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re for Wynterhall,\u201d he told the driver before climbing in. It didn\u2019t matter that it was late, or that he hadn\u2019t any of his belongings packed. He\u2019d send for them tomorrow. Perhaps he was a coward, but he just hadn\u2019t the heart to go home and face Isabel again. Toby settled onto the seat of the gloomy carriage and immediately turned his gaze to the small window. He couldn\u2019t abide the darkness right now, and he certainly couldn\u2019t sleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw her tear-streaked face, her pale expression of betrayal. That image would haunt him forever\u2014as would the knowledge that he\u2019d caused it. Staring out the carriage window thus, with his mind so filled with sorrow and regrets, it took him some moments to realize he was not alone. Not until the shadows across from him shifted in a stealthy, sinister way, drawing his eye. Toby\u2019s heart began to pound in his chest. He held his breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then ... the shadows spoke.</p><p>\u201cBel sent me a note.\u201d</p><p>Toby jumped in his seat. \u201cJesus,\u201d he said, pressing a hand over his racing heart. He leaned forward, blinking to make out his companion\u2019s form. \u201cSophia? Is that you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d He exhaled loudly. \u201cFor a moment there, I thought you were Gray, come to kill me.\u201d</p><p>She gave a disbelieving laugh. \u201cWhy would Gray want to kill you?\u201d</p><p>Well, if that answer wasn\u2019t obvious to her ...</p><p>Toby cleared his throat. \u201cJust what did Bel\u2019s note say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat Mr. Yorke had died, of course. And that you\u2019d be leaving for Surrey. Gray\u2019s away on business today, but I wanted to come pay my respects.\u201d She leaned forward and placed a hand on his arm. \u201cI know he meant a great deal to you, Toby. I\u2019m so sorry he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He stared at her hand on his sleeve, until she withdrew it. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem right,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew your whole family was there, and considering our history ... I didn\u2019t want to be a distraction.\u201d</p><p>The carriage wheels rattled over cobblestones as they rounded a turn.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d</p><p>He had to ask. He had to know, no matter how much it hurt to hear it, just what it was that made him so patently undesirable as a husband. And she was the only one who could tell him.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you run?\u201d</p><p>She faded back into the shadows and fell silent.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you jilt me?\u201d he continued, growing agitated. \u201cWhy did you leave without saying a word? Was it something I did? Something I didn\u2019t do? Was the prospect of marriage to me so revolting that you simply had to remove yourself to the other side of the globe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He punched the seat cushion. \u201cI said nothing. When you disappeared without so much as an adieu, I said nothing. When you returned from your little honeymoon cruise and all London was toasting Gray ... I said nothing, to anyone. I could have ruined you both, made you the center of speculation and scandal. But I didn\u2019t. And still, even now\u2014we\u2019re practically family, and yet you\u2019re barely civil to me. Damn it, you owe me some answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said hurriedly. \u201cI know I do. And I know I owe you far more than that. I\u2019ve simply been so ashamed, so sorry for how I treated you. I didn\u2019t know how to face you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re so ashamed of your behavior, why did you behave that way in the first place?</p><p>Did you have so little regard for my feelings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not. I cared for you, Toby, a great deal. I ... I suppose I cared for you too much to marry you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed bitterly. \u201cWhat a sentiment. Truly, it warms the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cared for you, but we didn\u2019t love one another,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought we both deserved to find love.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. Oh, yes. He had gotten what he deserved all right.</p><p>She spoke slowly now. Gently. \u201cI know the way I fled our wedding was wrongheaded and thoughtless, and you can\u2019t know how sorry I am for causing you pain. But would you have me regret it? Would you wish I hadn\u2019t left?\u201d</p><p>Now it was Toby\u2019s turn to evade answering. \u201cI think you shouldn\u2019t ask me that today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you and Bel have some sort of row?\u201d</p><p>He dismissed her question with a shake of his head. There was no way he was going to explain Hollyhurst to her. Instead, he tapped his knuckles against the coach side to signal the driver. It took several smart raps before he caught the man\u2019s attention and could direct him to the Grayson residence. If he\u2019d only had his walking stick, he would have had an easier time of it.</p><p>\u201cNo real purpose, my eye,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sophia asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He heaved an exasperated sigh. \u201cNo, there is something. I don\u2019t want to ask it. I don\u2019t want to hear the answer. But I simply have to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Toby crossed his legs, then uncrossed them. There was no way to say it but to say it. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have loved me? What does Gray have that I haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Toby. Please understand. It wasn\u2019t like that at all.\u201d She crossed the carriage to sit beside him. \u201cThis may not be what you want hear, but it\u2019s the truth. My leaving had very little to do with you, and everything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re giving me that line. Have you forgotten to whom you\u2019re speaking?\u201d He adopted a patronizing tone. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s not you, darling, it\u2019s me.\u2019 I\u2019ve used that excuse a hundred times if I\u2019ve used it once. It\u2019s never the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know ...\u201d She wrung her hands in her lap. \u201cI\u2019m trying my best to explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry harder.\u201d Toby didn\u2019t even attempt to mask the bitterness in his voice. He was hurting. No, it wasn\u2019t entirely her fault, or even mostly her fault, but she was the one nearby. Even though he had no hope of saving his marriage to Isabel, for some self-punishing reason he needed to understand why the first one had failed before it had even begun.</p><p>\u201cToby, I knew you admired my good qualities. My genteel accomplishments, my beauty ... my considerable dowry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t some impoverished fortune-hunter,\u201d he objected. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to marry for money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me honestly it wasn\u2019t an inducement?\u201d</p><p>Toby sighed. He couldn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t so much the dowry itself, but simply the suitability of the match. With her fortune and accomplishment and beauty, Sophia had seemed the sort of lady he ought to marry. The sort of lady who ought to want to marry him. She continued, \u201cI never felt like you truly knew me. At first, your praise was flattering. You were so charming, and you said all the things a girl most wants to hear. But after a while, those little compliments made me feel like a fraud. You always treated me as though I were perfect\u2014</p><p>and I wasn\u2019t. No one is. I feared I\u2019d be living a lie for the rest of my life\u2014that if you knew my</p><p>true nature, any regard you had for me would disappear.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cCan you understand? I had no shortage of people to admire my best qualities. What I needed was a man who understood me, and loved me even at my worst. Gray is that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he told her. \u201cI understand perfectly.\u201d Some help this conversation had been. She hadn\u2019t shed any light on Isabel\u2019s feelings, just made him even more acutely aware of his own. That was all he wanted, to be loved at his worst. And he\u2019d married a woman who just couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>Bollocks.</p><p>The carriage rolled to a halt at the Grayson house. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m anxious to be getting on to Surrey. Will you be offended if I don\u2019t see you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d The carriage door swung open, and Sophia reached for the footman\u2019s hand. At the last moment, she stopped. She said, \u201cI know I don\u2019t have to tell you, Bel is very invested in goodness. If I was anxious about revealing my worst to a husband, I can only imagine her fear. It must be ten times what mine was.\u201d</p><p>Silly woman, talking about Isabel as though she had something to fear from him. He loved that woman, body and soul. He\u2019d told her so, time and again. She was the one rejecting him.</p><p>\u201cSophia, my wife has nothing to worry about. Isabel doesn\u2019t have a worst. She\u2019s a selfless, perfect angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d Sophia\u2019s blue eyes flashed at him in the dimming twilight. \u201cDo you honestly want to know what drove me to jilt you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded mutely.</p><p>\u201cStatements like that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>On Friday morning, Bel waited for her guests in the Rose Parlor.</p><p>Except, it wasn\u2019t a rose parlor this morning. It was white\u2014all white. In preparation for the chimney-sweeping demonstration, the curtains had been removed and the carpets rolled away. The bric-a-brac had been boxed up, and each painting or stick of furniture had been carefully draped with a muslin dustcover.</p><p>In its austerity and simplicity, the space reminded Bel very strongly of her girlhood, and the hours spent in her mother\u2019s bedchamber. That room, too, had been stripped of drapery and ornament, for her mother\u2019s safety. After that horrific incident with the bedcurtains\u2014and then, a year or two later, the hearthrug catching fire ... Simple d\u00e9cor had seemed best. Yes, Bel thought, twisting her hands in her lap\u2014this morning, the Rose Parlor bore a striking resemblance to that spare, sunlit bedchamber in Tortola. All it lacked was the madwoman. Or ... perhaps it didn\u2019t.</p><p>El amor es locura.</p><p>Folding over her lap, Bel buried her face in her hands. She did not cry. In the two days since Toby had left, she\u2019d simply exhausted her supply of tears. Still, her shoulders quivered with the echoes of sobs. So many emotions cycled through her, faster and faster with each hour since he\u2019d left\u2014anger, despair, fear, loneliness, heartbreak. One moment, she missed Toby so fiercely she began packing for Surrey; the next, she would remember the artistic stylings of one Mr. Hollyhurst and resolve never to see his patron again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to think anymore. Except that she must be going mad. She ought to be grateful, that Toby had gone away. It had saved her the task of removing herself, or even more difficult\u2014creating false distance between them while they lived under the same roof. Because she had to distance herself, for both their sakes. After the way she\u2019d flown at him, cursed him, struck him ...</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t allow that scene to ever recur. She had to stay away from him. By leaving, he\u2019d spared her the trouble.</p><p>Not that they would stay apart forever, of course. They were married, after all. Eventually, she and Toby would have to cross paths. But by then, their anger with each other would have cooled, and their passion as well. With clear heads and mended hearts, they could begin again</p><p>\u2014and have the same kind of cordial marriage so many of their peers enjoyed. The sort of marriage Bel had always intended to have.</p><p>She knew Toby would have no difficulty finding physical pleasure in the arms of another; or others\u2014and Bel would not deny him that. She wanted him to be happy, and his warm, personable nature would not lend itself to solitude.</p><p>No, that part would be Bel\u2019s. She would put her emotions aside. She would rededicate her heart and mind to charity. She would save miserable waifs from suffocating in chimneys. Love and passion were not for her.</p><p>The room gradually filled with ladies, all attired in shades of gray and black, in accordance with the invitation. The women arranged their dark skirts over the muslin-draped furniture, until the entire tableau began to resemble not a snowdrift, but rather a flea\u2019s-eye vantage of a spotted hound.</p><p>And here came the flea.</p><p>\u201cLady Violet Morehouse,\u201d the butler intoned. The matron swept into the room, dressed head to toe in a repellent shade of puce.</p><p>\u201cLady Aldridge, my dear.\u201d She curtsied and flashed a smile so brittle and false, it threatened to slide right off her powdered face and shatter on the floor.</p><p>Bel yearned to help it along.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for not adhering to the dress requirements,\u201d she said, indicating her plumed, blood-red gown. \u201cBut while your morning may be beginning, my own evening is just coming to its close. I have not yet been home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter,\u201d Bel said, forcing a generous curtsy. \u201cI\u2019m simply delighted that you could find time to join us.\u201d</p><p>Lady Violet cleared her throat and placed a hand to her temple. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have a spot of tea to offer? I imagine wine is out of the question. I feel as though I\u2019ve wandered into a Quaker meeting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The ladies tittered with laughter.</p><p>Bel tamped down the irritation rising in her breast. Charity. She was living for charity now, and Lady Violet needed a great deal of it. \u201cTo be sure, I can offer you tea.\u201d She turned to address the room. \u201cOr coffee, or chocolate. Ladies, shall we go in to breakfast?\u201d</p><p>As the ladies filed down the corridor, someone clutched at Bel\u2019s elbow. She wheeled about.</p> <p>\u201cSophia! Oh, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve arrived.\u201d She wrapped her sister in a warm embrace. \u201cI was beginning to worry you wouldn\u2019t come. Augusta\u2019s in Surrey, of course, and I\u2019m on my own this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly I came. Do you think I\u2019d leave you to face these dragons alone?\u201d Sophia\u2019s blue eyes twinkled. \u201cBut before I forget,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI have a gift for you.\u201d She placed a small, flat package in Bel\u2019s hands, wrapped in brown paper and knotted with twine. \u201cIt\u2019s a book,\u201d she explained in a low voice. \u201cBut don\u2019t open it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the book. The one Lucy kept hinting about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, not that exact volume. I had to send a manservant to locate a fresh copy.\u201d The corner of her mouth pulled in a grimace. \u201cWhat an errand that was. Anyway, you really ought to have it. These things are meant to be passed on.\u201d</p><p>With a regretful look, Bel pushed the parcel back at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this...</p> <p>but I\u2019ve already seen it. Your copy, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Sophia clapped a hand over her burst of laughter. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was by accident, I assure you. I was looking for a sleeping draught and\u2014\u201d Bel nudged her sister down the corridor, where they could speak without drawing notice. \u201cI scarcely looked at the pictures, I promise. Once I realized ... what I realized, I quickly put it away. But truly, I read enough to know I\u2019m not interested in reading the rest. You can take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t read all of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no.\u201d Bel pressed the package toward Sophia again, but her sister would not take it.</p><p>\u201cThen you absolutely must have this one.\u201d</p> <p>Bel shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want it. Come now, The Memoirs of a Wanton Dairymaid? It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous book, filled with wicked fantasies and silly notions and improbable romance. But you ought to read the rest, just the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Sophia smiled. \u201cBecause it has a happy ending.\u201d</p><p>Too disheartened to argue further, Bel accepted the book and laid it on a side table. With a weak smile, she said, \u201cThis morning will end unhappily indeed if I keep my guests waiting any longer.\u201d</p><p>Crumpets dusted with powdered sugar, iced cakes, jam tarts, and macaroons... all these and more weighed down the sideboard in the breakfast room. Bel had been planning this menu for weeks. She held her breath as Mrs. Framingham plucked a glac\u00e9ed apricot from the apex of an artfully arranged pyramid. When the tower of fruit refused to topple, Bel heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cI must say,\u201d Sophia murmured, biting into a crumpet, \u201cas social gatherings go, I\u2019ve never seen its like. A ladies\u2019 breakfast party with requisite mourning attire, rife with potential for scandal and innuendo? Remarkable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they really here for the potential of scandal and innuendo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not here for chimney sweeping, I\u2019ll tell you that much.\u201d</p><p>Bel wilted in her chair. With Toby away and in mourning, she thought surely Mr. Hollyhurst\u2019s last caricature would have faded from public memory. If they had wished to see a lust-crazed Bel slavering over her rakish husband, they ought to have known it would not happen today. It would not happen, ever again.</p><p>\u201cBut they are here,\u201d Sophia continued, \u201cand you\u2019ll see, good will come of it. Sometimes a little scandal is just what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Toby once told me the same.\u201d</p><p>Toby had told her many things, so very few of them true.</p><p>\u201cLady Aldridge,\u201d Mrs. Breckinridge called, her mouth full of cake. \u201cYou must tell me how your cook gets this icing so creamy, so perfectly white. Is it a special recipe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s sweetened with love,\u201d Lady Violet said smugly. \u201cThat\u2019s the secret ingredient. This is a honeymoon house, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bel blurted out. She bit her lip. \u201cI mean, it isn\u2019t the recipe. It\u2019s the superior quality of the sugar. We use only the most refined sugar, imported by my brothers\u2019 shipping company. It\u2019s farmed on Tortola, on a freedmen\u2019s cooperative.\u201d She perked with inspiration. \u201cIf you like, I can give you a list of the merchants who stock it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do,\u201d Mrs. Breckinridge mumbled, taking another bite of cake. \u201cThis is divine.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, several other ladies expressed an interest in receiving the same list.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d Sophia murmured, giving Bel a smile. \u201cI told you good would come of it. And we haven\u2019t even had the demonstration yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of the demonstration, I had better make certain the equipment has been readied.\u201d Bel ducked into the corridor and made her way back toward the Rose Parlor. Then she stopped short.</p><p>A tall, familiar masculine silhouette filled the foyer. Bel\u2019s heart leapt.</p><p>\u201cJoss!\u201d she exclaimed, hurrying to greet him. \u201cHow good to see you. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. I need a list of the merchants who stock sugar from the cooperative. The ladies are ...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off as she noticed something odd about her brother\u2019s appearance. He was smiling. Grinning, really. Almost idiotically so. She hadn\u2019t seen him wear an expression like that in nearly two years, not since before Mara\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou obviously have something to say, and here I\u2019m blathering on. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you to help look after Jacob. I\u2019ll be away for a month or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course I will. Are you going to sea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. This is a land journey.\u201d He took her hands in his. \u201cBel, I\u2019m getting married.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. The breath whistled in and out of her a few times before she could convince her lips to form words. \u201cMarried? But to whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Miss Osborne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Hetta?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, grinning wider still.</p><p>\u201cMarried. To Hetta.\u201d Bel shook her head wonderingly. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I thought you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespised her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I did, too. Fortunately, Hetta\u2019s a great deal more clever than I.\u201d His eyes lit with pride. \u201cWe\u2019ll be traveling north, to see her father and be married from her home. Lord Kendall has generously offered us Corbinsdale for our honeymoon.\u201d He bent his head, seeking her gaze. \u201cBel, are you all right? You\u2019ve gone pale.\u201d</p><p>Bel put a hand to her brow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to act so shocked. I adore Hetta, and I\u2019m happy for you both. It\u2019s just such a surprise. After Mara, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would, either. But I\u2019ve never been so happy to be proven wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut marriage, Joss? And so quickly? Aren\u2019t you ...\u201d She chewed her lip. \u201cAren\u2019t you frightened at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m scared witless. That\u2019s how I know I\u2019m in love.\u201d</p><p>The mellow tones of his laughter warmed Bel, deep inside. She hadn\u2019t seen him like this in so long. How cruel life could be. She was getting her brother back and losing him again, all in the space of one morning. \u201cThat would explain why I\u2019m terrified for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt must be because I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>His demeanor turned serious. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget Mara,\u201d he told her. \u201cI loved her. I know you loved her, too. And I\u2019ll never forget how devastating it was to lose her. But I can\u2019t let fear keep me from living, from loving. Not anymore. I\u2019ve survived some of the worst life can throw at a man, but I\u2019m not going to let that keep me from enjoying the best.\u201d</p><p>She blinked back a tear. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, on the mail coach. Sophia and Gray are there with Jacob, of course, and his nursemaid. But I know he\u2019d enjoy frequent visits from his Auntie Bel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he shall have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBel?\u201d Sophia called from down the corridor. \u201cI think the ladies are nearly finished with breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d Bel said, sniffing. She gave Joss an apologetic smile. \u201cI must go. I have guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be going, too.\u201d He bent to kiss her cheek. \u201cOffer my congratulations to Toby, when you see him next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations? On what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn his election, naturally. The polls close today. I heard it from Gray, just this morning. Not that the outcome is in any doubt.\u201d Joss grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame. I\u2019m certain Toby would rather have won under different circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bel said, not wishing to make any contrary statement she would then be forced to explain. She was sure Toby would rather have not won at all. He\u2019d gone to such lengths to ensure his defeat. The image of that appalling caricature appeared in her mind, and she felt the stab of his betrayal anew. This, from the man who claimed to love her. Well, she was accustomed to receiving gestures of love and hurt from the same hands. She was a fool to have ever dropped her guard with Toby. And she most certainly should never have entertained notions of loving him in return. Bel knew how to survive the wounds of love, but she couldn\u2019t live with herself for inflicting them. He\u2019d made her feel safe, but it had all been a lie. No one could protect her from herself.</p><p>Meeting Joss\u2019s concerned gaze, she willed a smile to her face. Truly, she had no reason for complaint. Toby had been right\u2014now she\u2019d gotten exactly what she wanted. A polite, advantageous marriage to a man with a seat in Parliament, and the funds and opportunity to work tirelessly for the causes of good.</p><p>This was her happy ending.</p><p>\u201cPlease give my best wishes to Hetta, as well,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cShe\u2019s won herself the best of husbands. Here\u2014\u201d She snatched the paper-wrapped book from where she\u2019d left it earlier, on the side table. Pressing it into Joss\u2019s hand, she said, \u201cAn engagement gift for your bride.\u201d</p><p>Having bid her brother good-bye, Bel returned to the breakfast room and invited the ladies to join her in the parlor for their demonstration.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d said Lady Violet, settling into the wingbacked chair nearest the hearth, \u201cwhere is this strapping chimney sweep with his marvelously efficient equipment?\u201d</p><p>Laughter rippled through the assembled ladies.</p><p>\u201cThe equipment is here,\u201d Bel said, waving her hand toward a slender, jointed rod topped with an arrangement of stiff wire brushes. \u201cBut there is no chimney sweep. No man, at any rate. I will be the one to demonstrate the machinery.\u201d</p><p>The ladies all stared at her in shock, but Bel ignored them as she threaded her wrists through the armholes of an apron. After the scene at Aunt Camille\u2019s card party the other day, she was not about to bring a man into this assembly to be the target of carnal jibes, or worse\u2014the supposed object of Bel\u2019s lust. Besides, how better to demonstrate the brushes\u2019 efficiency than to show that even a lady could use them?</p><p>Her apron donned, Bel lifted the brushes for the ladies\u2019 inspection. \u201cYou see, the wires are arranged like a parasol. They remain collapsed as the machine is inserted into the flue.\u201d She flipped the brushes over. \u201cAs they are withdrawn, the bristles expand to scrub the walls clean. Unlike a climbing boy, who has but two arms and one small brush, this machine reaches every corner of the flue at once.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bel knelt at the hearth to insert the brushes through the fireplace. Unfolding the jointed rod and locking the sections into place, she advanced the contraption higher and higher. It wasn\u2019t quite as easy as she\u2019d imagined it would be. The flue was clogged with a winter\u2019s worth of soot, and it took a great deal of effort to push the brushes through the narrow passageway. Small trickles of ash filtered down periodically, dusting her hair and clothes.</p><p>As she worked, she sensed the ladies in the room growing restless. She surreptitiously wiped her brow on her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cIs your husband not at home, Lady Aldridge?\u201d Of course, it was Lady Violet\u2019s smug voice.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bel clipped, forcing the brushes upward with a vicious shove. \u201cHe is away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity,\u201d Lady Violet said. \u201cHe is so amusing with the ladies. One can always count on Sir Toby to enliven a dreary party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Bel said, her movements growing more agitated. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a party. If it\u2019s amusement you seek, you may wish to go elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>A hush cloaked the room. The scrapings of brush against flue were the only sounds.</p><p>\u201cAs for my husband,\u201d Bel continued, \u201che is not amusing any ladies this morning. He is in Surrey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, but surely there are ladies in Surrey,\u201d the matron said significantly. \u201cLadies eager to be amused, no less. But from what I read in The Prattler, Sir Toby\u2019s corner of Surrey has a most interesting geography. I understand it quite closely resembles an establishment known as the Hidden Pearl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t, dear girl.\u201d Lady Violet gave her a cruel smile. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why he\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>Bel\u2019s every muscle tensed. Anger heated her blood, but she could not let it boil over. She\u2019d worked so long and so hard to make this demonstration a success, and the lives of children could very well hang in the balance. Even though she was annoyed with Lady Violet for making such crude insinuations, and even more irritated with Toby for the caricatures that spawned them ... she would not be a slave to unpredictable passions.</p><p>Patience, she admonished herself. Goodness. Charity. Miserable waifs.</p><p>\u201cThe brushes are fully inserted now.\u201d She addressed the room calmly, rising to her feet and clapping the dust from her hands. \u201cAnd now, I give a small twist on the handle to expand the bristles, and as I retract the device, the soot will be removed.\u201d She gave Lady Violet an innocent smile. \u201cYou may wish to retreat now, my lady. To the back of the room, perhaps. Or further. This may get dirty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I think I shall remain. I\u2019m enjoying my front-row view immensely. What an enlightening morning this is proving to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Bel knelt again and began retracting the brush with rough yanks, twisting and turning the rod as she did. With each motion, a shower of soot rained down the chimney, settling around her skirts.</p><p>\u201cNow, typically this method is not so untidy,\u201d Bel explained as she worked. \u201cSweeps who use this machinery also have a set of curtains that they arrange before the hearth, so as not to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped short as her brush caught on an obstacle. \u201cSo as not to soil the\u2014\u201d A rougher tug gained her nothing. She braced one boot on the grate and pulled hard with both hands. No progress.</p><p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s stuck, dear,\u201d Lady Violet said helpfully.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s stuck,\u201d Bel snapped, releasing the rod and scrambling to her feet. Her breathing was quick and shallow. \u201cJust as these young children get stuck in flues with alarming frequency. Imagine, Lady Violet, that you\u2019re the one wedged into that flue two bricks wide. Imagine that you\u2019re the one stuck, unable to move, suffocating in a cloud of soot, frightened beyond belief. Imagine that your cruel master below is jabbing pins into your flesh to convince you to move\u2014</p><p>or, if that fails to work, lighting straws on fire and using them to toast the soles of your feet. Imagine, Lady Violet, that you are a miserable, impoverished, friendless child about to die. To be sacrificed on the altar of English tradition simply because a lady of the ton could not be bothered to instruct her housekeeper to embrace modern improvements.\u201d Bel sniffed and pushed a stray wisp of hair from her eyes. \u201cAre you enjoying that image, Lady Violet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the matron said smugly. \u201cBut I think you are.\u201d</p> <p>Bel gasped. Lady Violet was right. She was enjoying the image of a cramped, choked, sootcovered Lady Violet. She was enjoying it far too much. What was wrong with her? This was meant to be a charity function, not an exercise in hostility. But she had so much emotion churning inside her\u2014she felt like a volcano, preparing to erupt. The worst of it was, she couldn\u2019t very well flee the danger, when it resided in herself.</p><p>She could do this, she told herself, taking a deep breath and releasing it slowly. She could conquer her simmering passions and complete this demonstration with dignity and grace. She would not explode.</p><p>Sophia moved toward her. \u201cBel, you\u2019ve been working so hard. Perhaps you need a rest.\u201d</p><p>Bel warned her off with a shake of her head and bent down to take up the rod again. \u201cWhat I need is a bit of assistance. Let us work in harmony, Lady Violet. May I ask you to lend a hand?\u201d</p><p>The matron cast her a withering look. \u201cSurely you\u2019re joking, Lady Aldridge. As if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot strong enough, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that, I assure you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of a little soot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lady Violet\u2019s mouth thinned to a slim red gash in her face. She rose from her chair and placed her hands on the rod above Bel\u2019s. \u201cAnything to get me out of this mad house,\u201d she muttered to Bel. To the room at large, she sang, \u201cWhat a lark this is, Lady Aldridge. It\u2019s giving me all sorts of ideas for my next party. I think I shall distribute aprons at the door and invite all the ladies to take turns at scullery maid. After tea, each guest must wash her own cup and saucer.\u201d</p><p>The ladies giggled. Bel seethed inside, but she forced herself to remain outwardly calm. \u201cOn three, then?\u201d she asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cOn three,\u201d Lady Violet agreed. \u201cOh, but wait! I\u2019ve just had a brilliant idea for my autumn house party. We\u2019ll all play at dairymaid!\u201d</p><p>Bel ignored the laughter and began counting. \u201cOne ...\u201d</p><p>And somehow\u2014in that brief, fleeting moment\u2014a strange thing happened in Bel\u2019s mind. Grasping that wooden rod in her hand, listening to the mocking laughter of her peers, feeling the anger bubble and rise inside her ... she faced down the specter of madness.</p><p>\u201cTwo ...\u201d</p><p>She felt it keenly, the temptation to just give in. To go into a rage, scold Lady Violet, cast these insufferable women out of her home, and smash a few ceramic figurines, just to complete the dramatic effect. It would be so easy, to fly off the handle.</p><p>But Bel chose not to. Instead, she made a very calm, very rational decision. To let it go.</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>Bel released her grip and stepped back. She stood watching a few paces distant as\u2014. Whoosh.</p><p>Lady Violet\u2019s full-strength tug released a deluge of ashes and soot. A plume of black vapor swallowed her puce-clad form.</p><p>Turning away from the cloud of ash, Bel clapped her hands over her face. Oh, there was no more laughter now. The room was so silent, she could hear the coal dust settling to the floor. Slowly, she lowered her hands, uncovering only her eyes, and turned back to face the hearth.</p><p>Lady Violet stood before her, coated with coal dust from crown to toe, sputtering and fuming like a snuffed candlewick. Around them, a dozen ladies stood stock-still, handkerchiefs pressed to their mouths in horror.</p><p>Bel kept her own hands clamped over her mouth, to no avail. No matter how hard she pressed her fingers against her lips, she couldn\u2019t prevent it.</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>It started with a few inane giggles, then quickly progressed to full-throated peals of laughter. She couldn\u2019t help it. This demonstration was a travesty and her marriage was a disaster and she was very likely going insane\u2014and there was just nothing for it but to laugh. Laugh loudly and long. Really, where was the benefit in being a madwoman, if it didn\u2019t entitle one to bursts of wild laughter?</p><p>Bel laughed until her sides ached and she was wiping away sooty tears with her handkerchief. Then she met Lady Violet\u2019s shocked blue eyes, staring out at her from an ash-powdered face. The matron stood frozen in place, hands raised in surrender, and before Bel even knew what she was doing, she embraced the woman. She caught Lady Violet in an unabashed, exuberant hug and laughed harder still.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could say I\u2019m sorry for your gown,\u201d Bel said at length, stepping back. \u201cBut really, the invitation did explicitly call for black.\u201d</p><p>She removed her own soot-matted apron and cast it aside. \u201cWell,\u201d she said to the gawping ladies, who had now most certainly witnessed the scandal they came for, \u201cthis concludes the demonstration. Lady Grayson will pass round the list of professional chimney sweeps who use machinery in place of climbing boys. I do hope you will employ their services in your house holds. Unless, of course, Lady Violet is taking on clients.\u201d She giggled again as she headed for</p><p>the door.</p><p>Sophia rushed to her side. \u201cBel, where are you going? Are you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m well. But I\u2019m going to Surrey.\u201d Craning her neck, she glanced at the clock in the corridor. \u201cAnd I have to make haste, or I\u2019ll be too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for what?\u201d Sophia asked.</p><p>Ignoring her, Bel turned to the ladies. \u201cPlease excuse me, but I\u2019ve just remembered an urgent appointment and I need to ...\u201d Her laughter turned to nausea as she realized what her plan entailed.</p><p>Oh, blast.</p><p>But she\u2019d made the decision now. Just as Joss had said, she couldn\u2019t let fear hold her back. She finished weakly, \u201cI need to order the carriage.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>Toby stood at the foot of the hustings platform, waiting for Colin Brooks to wrestle into that abominable yellow topcoat and come make his victory official. As he waited, he paced back and forth, every so often tossing his walking stick into a fresh grip and resisting the urge to do something truly ridiculous, like fondle the ivory knob.</p><p>Really, what a sentimental fool he\u2019d become. He had a full set of clothing at Wynterhall\u2014more than enough to see him through Yorke\u2019s funeral and the election\u2014yet he\u2019d sent two servants to Town with directions to pack up half his wardrobe. All that effort, simply an excuse to retrieve this useless walking stick.</p><p>Certainly, if he could have done so without looking a complete ass, he would have requested even more embarrassing mementos. A lock of jet-black hair, a verbena-scented pillow, a swatch of that red silk gown ... But this walking stick was the only thing of her that belonged unequivocally to him\u2014and as a consequence, he was making rather a fetish of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s keeping Brooks?\u201d he asked the sheriff\u2019s deputy.</p><p>The man gave him a mumbled \u201cdunno\u201d and picked his teeth.</p><p>Toby paced away again, swinging the stick with impatience. The sooner Brooks arrived, the sooner the election results could be made official\u2014and the sooner Toby could be on his way back to London. To her.</p><p>What an idiot he\u2019d been. Sophia\u2019s words had shown him the error of his ways even before he\u2019d left the Town limits. Well, truthfully, he\u2019d sulked most of the way to Surrey, but he\u2019d come to his senses sometime before the carriage drew up to Wynterhall\u2019s moat. All he\u2019d wanted was for Isabel to see him at his worst, and love him. And stupid blighter that he was, he\u2019d failed his own test. He\u2019d professed his undying love for her, and the moment she\u2019d become (quite rightfully, he might add) angry with him, he\u2019d deserted her. God, what a struggle he\u2019d had over the past two days, fighting the urge to ride back to her and simply fall at her feet, beg her forgiveness. But there were things he needed to do here in Surrey\u2014not just because they needed doing, but because Toby needed to do them, to prove his own worth. He needed to see his friend buried with honor, he needed to lend support to his grieving mother ... and now he needed to secure this seat in Parliament. Really, it was all she\u2019d ever asked of him. Such a small thing. Why the devil had he ever resisted? He could have so easily secured her regard, if not her love. Now he\u2019d lost any chance for either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could only try his best to put things right and hope her anger would fade with time. Perhaps he\u2019d never earn her love, but Toby could live with being allowed to love her. He\u2019d have to learn to live with that much, because he certainly couldn\u2019t survive without her. The past two days had taught him that.</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d</p><p>He ceased pacing. His eyes snapped up, and he spied a familiar figure coming toward him. Make that two familiar figures.</p> <p>\u201cGray. Jem.\u201d Toby nodded at his brother-in-law, then his friend. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m financing your campaign,\u201d Gray said, patting the pocket of his coat.</p><p>\u201cWhat, with bribes?\u201d Toby asked.</p><p>\u201cIf it comes to that. So far, pints of ale are doing well enough.\u201d</p><p>Toby turned to Jeremy. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d Jeremy shrugged. \u201cI have no idea. Gray made me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bring the gold,\u201d Gray said, gesturing toward Jeremy, \u201cand he brings the class. Figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to have an earl backing you.\u201d</p><p>Toby scratched the back of his neck. \u201cGray, you do realize that, of the two opposing candidates, one has died\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other is the local bedlamite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd nearly all the votes have been cast and tallied, and I have an insurmountable lead. Yet you still seem to think I need bribes and aristocratic backers to scrape out a victory?\u201d Toby shook his head. \u201cYour faith in me ... What to say? It\u2019s so inspiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for you,\u201d Gray said testily. \u201cI\u2019m here for Bel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for Bel, too,\u201d Toby said. \u201cJem, are you here for Bel?\u201d</p><p>Jeremy heaved an exasperated sigh. \u201cI have no idea why I\u2019m here. I really wish I weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Toby said. \u201cThen go home, the both of you.\u201d</p><p>Gray narrowed his eyes. \u201cNow see here. I\u2019m not taking any chances with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you see here.\u201d Toby leveled his walking stick at his brother-in-law. \u201cIsabel is my wife. She asked me to run for Parliament, not you.\u201d He turned to Jeremy. \u201cAnd she hasn\u2019t asked you for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jeremy said, raising his hands in defense. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here. He told me we were going to the club.\u201d</p> <p>Toby continued, \u201cWhen I win this election, it may be no great victory\u2014but it will be my victory. Mine alone to lay at Isabel\u2019s feet. I refuse to share what ever thimbleful of glory I earn with either of you. So go home. You don\u2019t get to be the heroes today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d a gravelly voice announced from behind, \u201cnone of you do.\u201d</p><p>The barrel of a musket forced its way into their triangle, sending Toby\u2019s walking stick clattering to the ground. All three men took a quick step back\u2014</p><p>Only to freeze in unison when they heard a chorus of ominous clicks\u2014the unmistakable sound of several guns being cocked.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Toby whispered, raising his hands. He swiveled his head to either side. Colonel Montague\u2019s oafish nephews surrounded them, each training a gun on Toby\u2019s person. \u201cWhat the devil is going on?\u201d he asked the nephew who\u2019d spoken. The largest one, he noted with dismay.</p><p>\u201cNow Sir Toby,\u201d he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t think you really want to be a candidate for MP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Toby said. \u201cI assure you, I do.\u201d</p><p>The oaf prodded Toby\u2019s chest with his gun. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. A London toff like you? You never cared spit about this borough before. Going on thirty years, the colonel\u2019s been standing up as a candidate. The old man\u2019s getting weaker every winter. He won\u2019t likely have another chance. And now that Yorke\u2019s dead, he can finally win. So you\u2019re going to let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him?\u201d Toby echoed, incredulous. \u201cEven if I wished to, I couldn\u2019t. The polling is closed. Colin Brooks will be out here any moment to make the result official.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin Brooks is currently having a little chat with my cousin,\u201d the oaf said. \u201cI have it on good authority, he won\u2019t make it out here until after you\u2019ve withdrawn your candidacy.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Gray took a step to the left. The red-faced oaf swung around, training his gun on him. Gray froze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t anyone try anything funny,\u201d Montague\u2019s nephew said.</p><p>Toby sighed. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, man. Do you honestly think you\u2019re going to shoot us? I may be just a baronet, but Jem there is an earl. Murdering a peer of the realm is a certain ticket to the gallows. And you\u2019re surrounded by witnesses.\u201d He gestured broadly at the spectators pressing in around them, all of whom had gone stone quiet. \u201cNot to mention, the Colonel\u2019s election would never stick. Someone would have him declared incompetent and removed from office, and where would that leave the poor old fool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then he\u2019d have been an MP, wouldn\u2019t he? Even if only for a while. The poor old fool would die happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is pointless,\u201d Toby said, shaking his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you say. I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>The gun swung back to point at him. \u201cYou really think you\u2019ve earned this seat in Parliament?</p><p>You think you want it as badly as the Colonel does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and no,\u201d Toby answered. \u201cBut my wife wants me to have it with a righteous passion. And I love my wife more than I love the Colonel.\u201d</p><p>The crowd erupted in laughter, and Montague\u2019s nephew\u2019s face turned an impressive shade of purple.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Toby said, lifting his hands and flashing a disarming grin, \u201cbut it\u2019s the truth. She\u2019s prettier.\u201d He slowly extended one hand toward the man. \u201cCome on, now. Let\u2019s not do things this way. I have great respect for your uncle, I do. So does everyone here. We can work out some other way to honor him\u2014declare him the borough\u2019s sergeant-at-arms, perhaps. Tell your cousins to lower their guns. Let\u2019s all head into the tavern for a pint, and we\u2019ll discuss this like civilized folk.\u201d</p><p>And just when Toby was sure he had him\u2014just when the man\u2019s face faded to a pinkish hue, and the barrel of the musket lowered a fraction\u2014it all went to hell. From the back of the crowd, a panicked cry went up. The sounds of hoofbeats on stone and horses whinnying quickly followed. Spectators began to scatter, though the armed men surrounding them held their ground. Madman Montague had trained them well.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Toby whispered. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d His heart plummeted to his boots. He couldn\u2019t possibly be reliving this nightmare.</p><p>But evidently he was.</p><p>The crowd parted, just as it had that day. And here was the carriage bearing down on them, the horses driving at breakneck speed.</p><p>And there, perched on the tufted leather, clutching the irons for dear life, her face a pale mask of terror\u2014was Isabel.</p><p>\u201cYou can stop now,\u201d Bel called.</p><p>The driver hauled on the reins, drawing the horses to an abrupt halt in the center of the village square. Bel didn\u2019t even wait for someone to help her down. She leapt from the open carriage as soon as its wheels slowed and raced toward her husband.</p><p>\u201cToby,\u201d she said, gulping air. \u201cToby, I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, keeping his hands raised near his shoulders, as if he was afraid to touch her. Well, and really\u2014who wouldn\u2019t be? Bel\u2019s hands flew to her face. Heavens, she must look a sight. What bits of her that hadn\u2019t already been covered in soot were now dusty from the road, and her hair was blown every which way. And of course, Toby was turned out in magnificent splendor, every inch the tall, dashing gentleman.</p><p>\u201cYou look marvelous,\u201d she told him, just because she could.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said slowly, taking in her appearance. \u201cYou look ... rather singed. But I\u2019m very glad to see you, despite the fact that you nearly scared me into an early grave just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, shaking out her skirts. \u201cI told him to drive like the devil was on our heels. And I am a bit crisped at the edges, aren\u2019t I?\u201d She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s to be expected, I suppose. I spent my morning dueling a dragon. They haven\u2019t called the election yet, have they?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head no.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Truly, I apologize for scaring you. I just had to speak with you right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, still holding his hands up. \u201cYou, and several other people.\u201d</p><p>He twisted his head from side to side, and for the first time since she\u2019d driven into the square, Bel looked at something other than her husband.</p><p>Oh, my.</p><p>Here was her brother. And Lord Kendall. And a half-dozen men surrounding them all with guns. She took a startled step back, tripping over something that felt like a stick\u2014not that she was going to look down to verify it.</p><p>\u201cToby?\u201d she asked in a cautious voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you see\u2014\u201d</p><p>A big red-faced man poked Toby in the chest with the barrel of a musket. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on is that we have guns. And you\u2019ll listen to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Bel said, turning to stare up at the man. \u201cI\u2019ve just traveled three hours by carriage at a thundering clip\u201d\u2014she turned to her husband\u2014\u201cand Toby, you know how I hate traveling by carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, flashing a gorgeous smile. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the man with a gun. \u201cAnyhow, I\u2019ve suffered through three hours of torment just to speak with my husband, and guns or no guns, he\u2019s going to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBel,\u201d Gray said in a low voice, \u201cperhaps you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDolly, please don\u2019t take this the wrong way. But why are you even here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been asking him the same thing,\u201d Toby said.</p><p>\u201cAs have I,\u201d Lord Kendall said dryly. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019d have received a more satisfactory answer if we called him Dolly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDolly?\u201d A few of the men with guns began to snicker.</p><p>Bel clenched her hands into fists and dropped her gaze to the ground. Why was it that whenever she had something important to say, the people around her couldn\u2019t stop laughing?</p><p>Her eyes caught on Toby\u2019s walking stick, where it lay at her feet. That must have been what she\u2019d tripped over earlier.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d the red-faced man shouted.</p><p>The laughter ceased.</p><p>The man continued, \u201cBeggin\u2019 pardon, my lady, but Sir Toby doesn\u2019t have time to listen to you just now. Sir Toby is going to make his way onto that hustings platform and make a little announcement. Or else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr else what?\u201d Bel asked.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? Or else I\u2019ll shoot him,\u201d the man ground out, jabbing Toby again with the gun.</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Bel said, rolling her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to shoot anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d he snarled, his face reddening further, \u201cI suggest you go back to your\u2014\u201d</p><p>She never did hear that suggestion in its entirety. Bel crouched, grabbed Toby\u2019s walking stick, and came up swinging. She smacked the oaf in the head with its blunt ivory knob, and he slumped to the ground with a thud, unconscious.</p><p>Bel yelled at him anyway. \u201cI\u2019m speaking to my husband, you ... you ... Oh, you\u2019re not worth it.\u201d She held the stick aloft and turned to Toby. \u201cYou were right. It does come in handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A burst of laughter escaped him. \u201cYes, it does.\u201d</p><p>She looked around at the other armed men, who had all lowered their weapons, seemingly bereft at the loss of their leader. Then she looked back down at the unconscious brute. \u201cDid I truly just do that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d Toby said, coming forward wearing a smile handsome enough for the devil.</p><p>\u201cAnd it was magnificent.\u201d He took the walking stick from her hand and let it fall to the ground before folding her into his arms. \u201cMy God, Isabel, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait!\u201d She pushed away from him. \u201cToby, I came here to talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d he said, still smiling. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came here to say that I...\u201d</p><p>He nodded encouragingly. \u201cThat you ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m so angry at you!\u201d</p><p>His face shuttered. \u201cOh.\u201d He shifted his weight, flicking a self-conscious gaze sideways.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019ve come all this way to say? That you\u2019re angry at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her hands balling into fists. \u201cYes. You need to know. You need to see me for who I truly am. I\u201d\u2014she jabbed a finger in her chest\u2014\u201cam a woman who gets angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. How could you? I didn\u2019t see it until just today. I\u2019m not selfless, Toby. I\u2019m certainly no angel. And I can\u2019t be mad. Didn\u2019t you tell me, if you\u2019re aware that you\u2019re mad, you\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen I can\u2019t be insane. What I am is angry. I get angry, all the time, in the most useless ways. I get angry at things I can\u2019t hope to correct, like injustice and violence and oppression. I get angry at things years in the past\u2014at my brothers for leaving me to grow up alone, at my poor dead father for being an intemperate lecher, and at my poor dead mother just for going mad. I get angry when people make fun of the old and infirm. I go positively livid when I see a maltreated child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he said, stepping toward her.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d she insisted, tears stinging her eyes. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly understand. You\u2019ve always been happy, always been so loved. You can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, to see people in pain and feel that suffering, all tangled up with your own. To need some way to channel all that anger into something good ... or you\u2019ll simply go mad with it.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out a hand. \u201cDarling, please. Let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d she said, ignoring his hand and leveling a finger at him. \u201cWhen women flirt with you, I get so angry I could stick them with pins. When men point guns at you, I get so angry I\u2019ll club them with sticks.\u201d</p><p>The oaf at her feet began to moan and stir.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d she told him, \u201cor I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d To Toby she asked, \u201cWhat did he want, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Toby tilted his head and regarded the crumpled figure. \u201cHe wanted me to withdraw my candidacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d A wild giggle bubbled up from her chest. \u201cThat\u2019s what I meant to ask of you, too.\u201d She tapped the man\u2019s shoulder with the toe of her boot. \u201cSo sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t withdraw my candidacy,\u201d Toby said, frowning, \u201cor Colonel Montague will win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Bel asked.</p><p>\u201cSo ... he\u2019s ancient, deaf, and insane.\u201d Toby crossed his arms. \u201cI can\u2019t allow it to happen, in good conscience. Besides, isn\u2019t this what you wanted? You wanted a husband in Parliament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you,\u201d she blurted out. Her hand went to her throat. \u201cI wanted you, from the very first moment I saw you. I\u2019ve been pushing you into all these political and charitable roles ever since, so I could pretend I had some nobler cause in mind. But I didn\u2019t. I just wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel ...\u201d He came toward her again, arms open.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stayed him with an open palm. \u201cI\u2019m not done being angry yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His arms fell. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll just... wait for you to do the embracing, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be best.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cToby, of all the things and people I\u2019m angry at, I\u2019m most angry at you. I trusted you, and you lied to me. And I understand why you did it, and I can even forgive you ... but that doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less. So I\u2019m angry at you for lying, but I\u2019m angrier still at how deeply you\u2019ve made me care.\u201d Tears leaked from the corners of her eyes, and she dabbed at them impatiently. \u201cYou made me love you, Toby, so much I could hate you for it.\u201d She smothered a sob with her palm. \u201cI\u2019ve never said that to anyone before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe part about love?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she choked out through tears. \u201cThe part about hate.\u201d</p><p>From that very first kiss, he\u2019d made her feel everything\u2014the good and the bad. He brought all her passions to the surface, when she\u2019d worked so long to subdue them. It was infuriating and wonderful and so very frightening. She just didn\u2019t know what to do. Fortunately, he seemed to have an idea.</p><p>\u201cI lied,\u201d he said, putting his hands on her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I lied to you again just now. I\u2019m not going to wait for you to do the embracing.\u201d</p><p>His arms went around her, and Bel rested against his strong, solid chest, shedding tears and soot all over his coat.</p><p>\u201cHush, love,\u201d he said, rocking her gently. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Haven\u2019t I told you, time and again?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back slightly and tilted her face to his. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful when you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him. Tightened her arms around his neck, stretched up on tiptoe, and kissed him, in front of everyone. In front of hundreds of gaping spectators, in front of six men with muskets</p><p>... good heavens, in front of her brother.</p><p>And it was wonderful. Everyone cheered. Even the men with guns.</p><p>Well, perhaps not her brother.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she said, between nibbles at his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to withdraw from the race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to win,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter to me whether or not you serve in Parliament. I won\u2019t force you into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being forced.\u201d Putting some distance between them, he took her hands in his. \u201cI know it wasn\u2019t my original intention, but now I want to serve, for several reasons. It\u2019s my duty as a gentleman of privilege, for one. And I want to honor Mr. Yorke\u2019s legacy, for another. In many ways, he was a father to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Bel said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there for you when he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I was sorry you weren\u2019t, too\u2014but I knew it was my own fault.\u201d He kissed her hand.</p><p>\u201cBut Isabel, the largest reason I want to be elected to Parliament is this: I want to do it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening? You shouldn\u2019t do this for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I should. I love you, and there\u2019s no better reason to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He took her in his arms again. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to have my say, all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He spoke softly, only to her. \u201cIsabel, you were right about me. I\u2019m capable of far more than this frivolous life I\u2019ve been leading, and I knew it long before we met. For years now, I\u2019ve wished for some greater purpose, and you were right to push me to find one. But you don\u2019t get to choose it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d She stroked his cheek. \u201cI was wrong to even try. That\u2019s why I want you to withdraw from the race.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m going to be elected to Parliament, where I will represent this borough with honor. And I will continue to manage my estate. I think I\u2019ll prove reasonably competent at both. But my highest goal, my true reason for living, is right here in my arms. It\u2019s you, darling. It\u2019s us. You are everything I\u2019ve been yearning for, for so long\u2014a perfect fit for all my natural talents.\u201d He smiled, and brushed a tear from her cheek. \u201cLoving you gives meaning to my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d She bent her head, resting her brow against his chest.</p><p>He whispered in her ear, \u201cAnd by God, I will excel at it. I mean to love you so well, so fiercely. To make certain you never doubt what a remarkable, beautiful woman you are. To make certain the world knows it, too. To create a stable, loving home for you and our family. To give you a place where you will always feel safe.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her hands inside his coat, needing to hold him tight.</p><p>\u201cThose may not be the sort of accomplishments that end up in the papers,\u201d he continued, \u201cor earn a man society\u2019s applause. But they\u2019re important, just the same. And as I look around at the world, I realize ... it\u2019s astonishing, how few men are truly good at them.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her face to his. \u201cYou will be magnificent at them. A true champion. I have complete</p><p>faith in you.\u201d</p><p>He was right, of course. Toby was a rare man indeed.</p><p>In all her life, Bel had never met a person with such infectious warmth and good humor, or his instinctive talent for making those around him feel confident and secure. That combination had attracted her to him from the very beginning. Well, that and the devastating grin spreading across his face.</p><p>Oh, she was the luckiest woman alive.</p><p>He said, \u201cThen I advise you to get accustomed to this idea, that you are worth any effort. Learn to live with the burden of being adored. Take all that righteous anger, darling, and go forth to battle the dragons of injustice ... but you must always come home to me.\u201d He kissed her nose.</p><p>\u201cBecause I intend to be, above everything, a devoted husband.\u201d A sly gleam stole into his eye as he added, \u201cAnd a doting father.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cHow did you know? Even I\u2019m not certain yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain. And I knew it the moment I saw you. I\u2019ve three older sisters, with ten nieces and nephews between them. I can just tell.\u201d</p><p>She buried her face in his coat. \u201cI\u2019m frightened. I\u2019m not sure I know how to be a good mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be the most loving, patient mother who ever lived.\u201d He held her tight. \u201cExcept on the rare days you aren\u2019t. On those days, I\u2019ll take the children to the park.\u201d</p><p>She laughed into his chest. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d She raised her face to his. \u201cHow do you always know exactly what it is I most need to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy.\u201d He bent to whisper in her ear. \u201cHere I divulge a great secret, darling. I just say what ever it is I\u2019d most like to hear back.\u201d His breath warmed her cheek as he murmured hopefully, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Toby.\u201d She melted inside. If there were a better man on this earth\u2014she would still want this one. Forever. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>FIVE YEARS LATER</p><p>\u201cWell? Did you manage to kill anything today?\u201d</p><p>Toby stretched out on the grassy riverbank, reclining on one elbow. \u201cBagged one partridge. Henry has himself a fine brace of pheasants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all? I knew I should have gone with you.\u201d Lucy looked up at him, the faint gleam of bloodlust in her eye. It was an expression completely at odds with her otherwise maternal appearance. She sat on a quilted picnic blanket, resting her weight on one outstretched hand while the fingers of the other combed her infant\u2019s dark curls.</p><p>Beside her, Sophia shaded a charcoal sketch of the slumbering baby boy. \u201cEventually,\u201d she said without looking up, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to stop calling this our annual hunting party. You men so rarely bring anything back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough,\u201d Toby said, watching the play of sunshine and brisk autumn breeze on the stream\u2019s dappled surface. \u201cBut then, our annual \u2018tromping-through-the-woods-to-prove-ourmanliness party\u2019 lacks that certain ring.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd where are these other exemplars of manliness?\u201d Lucy asked, drawing a thin blanket over her child.</p><p>\u201cFelix went up to the manor, I think. Henry took Jem and Gray by the kennels to see his new foxhounds. They\u2019ll be around shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure why Gray goes along with you,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like violence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither does Jeremy,\u201d Lucy replied. \u201cHe never could bring himself to shoot a single bird. And then there\u2019s Felix, whose aim has always been hopeless. Soon Tommy will start begging to go along, and that may put a stop to the hunting excursions completely.\u201d She cast a glance toward her older son, who was entertaining a trio of little girls downstream: two fair, one dark. Lucy continued, \u201cJeremy\u2019s determined that no child of his will ever touch a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not wise,\u201d Toby said. He could understand his friend\u2019s protectiveness, considering how Jem\u2019s brother\u2014Tommy\u2019s namesake\u2014had been tragically killed. But he didn\u2019t agree with it. \u201cThe boys will only grow more curious, if he forbids them, and it\u2019s curiosity that breeds accidents. In fact, I once knew a girl who secretly followed a hunting party and very nearly got herself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Lucy asked, feigning innocence. They both knew he referred to the day they\u2019d met, when young Lucy startled a covey and Toby\u2019s shot missed her by inches. They\u2019d been close ever since.</p><p>\u201cWhat an incorrigible child,\u201d she continued. \u201cI suppose she came to a very bad end indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. She grew into a lovely, elegant countess.\u201d He smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the boys. I\u2019ll talk to Jem.\u201d</p> <p>A chorus of squeals broke out as young Tommy plucked a grass snake from the rushes and held his wriggling prize aloft. Shrieking, the two blond girls went scurrying up the bank. The third, darker girl held her ground, however, shouting not at the snake, but at Tommy\u2014adjuring him to set the poor creature free.</p><p>Toby smiled. That was his Lyddie. She\u2019d inherited her mother\u2019s keen sense of justice, along with that dark, glossy hair.</p><p>\u201cDrat,\u201d Sophia muttered, putting aside her sketch to chase after her two daughters. \u201cThey\u2019ll run crying all the way to their papa now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d Lucy called after her. She shook her head and grinned at Toby. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do in her place. It\u2019s a good thing I give birth to boys, while she has the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far.\u201d He flicked a meaningful glance toward Sophia. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if the pattern holds true in six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? She hasn\u2019t said a thing.\u201d Lucy\u2019s cheeks dimpled with a wide grin. \u201cBut I suspected she\u2019d brought home a little memento from Italy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Toby said cannily, \u201cSophia\u2019s baby won\u2019t even be the next.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cSurely Isabel isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s far too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know it\u2019s not me,\u201d Lucy said. Her chin ducked. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He nodded toward two women sitting under a beech tree: their hostess, Marianne Waltham, and Sophia\u2019s sister, Kitty. \u201cLooks like Felix has finally hit the mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank heavens. Kitty\u2019s been waiting so long. For a moment there, I thought you meant Marianne again.\u201d</p><p>They laughed together. Henry, as the first to marry, had them all bested with six children ... but so far, Toby judged, no seventh on the way.</p><p>\u201cIs Isabel up at the house?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat an old, complacent husband you\u2019ve become. You went all of five minutes without asking after her. Yes, she took the baby for his feeding, a short time ago.\u201d She touched the back of her fingers to her own child\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou will talk to Jeremy, about the boys and hunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I have my ways of making him listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, brilliant politician that you are. And Jeremy would never let on, but I know he respects your opinion immensely.\u201d A breeze feathered her dark-brown curls, and she tilted her face to it. \u201cAs do I. Now that Aunt Matilda\u2019s gone ... besides Henry and Marianne, this group is all the family we have. You must promise me you\u2019ll never stop returning to Waltham Manor each year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jesting? Isabel and Lyddie love it here. You couldn\u2019t keep us away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has never really been a hunting party, Toby. It\u2019s always been a family party, long before any of us married. And you were always the one who held us together, with your affable nature and warmth. You taught a handful of surly, wounded orphans what it was to be happy and secure, surrounded by people who care.\u201d She gave him a self-conscious smile.</p><p>\u201cThat must be why I was so in love with you, all those years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, were you?\u201d he teased, remembering the way she\u2019d clung to him all those autumns, like a spindly second shadow. \u201cI never guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d She lifted one eyebrow. \u201cBut here is something I\u2019ve never told you.\u201d Despite the fact there was no one but a sleeping infant to hear, she leaned closer and lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cDo you know, that year you brought Sophia here ... I was so desperate with jealousy, I planned to sneak into your room and seduce you, so you\u2019d have to marry me instead.\u201d</p><p>Toby\u2019s jaw went slack. No, he hadn\u2019t known that. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what happened? I suppose you came to your senses in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way,\u201d she said, smiling impishly. \u201cI somehow ended up in Jeremy\u2019s room instead.\u201d Her head made a pensive tilt, and she looked up at him, a girlish vulnerability shining in her green eyes. \u201cI sometimes wonder, though ... what would have happened if I\u2019d found my way to yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat indeed.\u201d He chucked her under the chin. It was a tender, reassuring gesture honed through years of practice\u2014a gesture he often used with his daughter now. \u201cLucy,\u201d he said,</p><p>\u201cplease take this in the kindest possible way. I\u2019m very glad we\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>Slowly ... gingerly ... easy now.</p><p>Bel lowered her sleeping baby to the bedding. She rocked his cradle gently, keeping one palm flat on his tiny belly until his rhythmic breaths told her he\u2019d fallen into a deep sleep. Still she stood there, admiring the tiny notch carved in his earlobe, and the sweet curve of his eyelashes fluttering against a rounded, cherubic cheek. Such a beautiful, perfect boy. Love swelled within her, until her heart ached.</p><p>\u201cDu\u00e9rmete, mi amor,\u201d she whispered. Sleep, my love. When she\u2019d first married, Bel had been terrified by the intense emotions her husband inspired in her. Gradually, with Toby\u2019s patience and care, she\u2019d learned to delight in their shared passion rather than fear it. But nothing could have prepared her for this\u2014the fierce, boundless love a mother felt for her children. There was no controlling this emotion, and certainly no way to separate it from fear.</p><p>As she watched her baby sleep so innocently, guarding him with the light pressure of one palm, it pierced her heart to acknowledge that, no matter how she and Toby tried to protect him, no matter how tightly they wrapped him in love\u2014this child would inevitably know pain, illness, danger, sorrow.</p><p>But he would never know them at his mother\u2019s hand. Of that much, Bel felt assured. The door creaked softly behind her.</p><p>\u201cOnly me,\u201d a familiar voice whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t be startled.\u201d</p><p>The door clicked shut just as quietly, and moments later, strong arms cinched around her waist. Toby settled his chin on her shoulder. \u201cIs he asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His lips grazed the sensitive place beneath her ear, and the kiss echoed in the soles of her feet. Bel released a sigh of pleasure. He always knew just where to kiss her, to set her knees quivering.</p><p>\u201cLyddie\u2019s down at the stream with the others,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe have some time to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back against his chest, and his hands slid to cup her breasts. They were emptied of milk now\u2014soft, and sensitized at the tips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wake the baby,\u201d she protested feebly, and insincerely.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d he said, taking her hand and tugging her toward the adjoining bedchamber. \u201cWe\u2019ll be very, very quiet.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a mischievous smile. He knew as well as she, it was difficult for her to be quiet when they made love. Being in Toby\u2019s arms\u2014it was the safest place in Bel\u2019s world, and the one place she released all her inhibitions. He delighted in making her cry out in bed. Sometimes he made her scream. Oftentimes lately, he made her laugh.</p><p>And sometimes, like this afternoon, when a sleeping child was nearby and they needed to be very, very quiet\u2014he loved her so gently, so sweetly, he made her weep silent tears of pleasure and joy.</p><p>Afterward, she lay in his arms, breathing deep, labored breaths scented with his comforting masculine spice. The afternoon sunlight gilded the sculpted contours of his shoulders and chest and painted amber streaks through his light brown hair.</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d he replied, \u201cI was about to speak those exact words to you.\u201d</p><p>Together they floated in that magic, idyllic space between wakefulness and sleep.</p><p>\u201cToby,\u201d she asked softly, \u201cwill we always be this ridiculously happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d His voice was drowsy. \u201cWill you still love me anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hugged him tight. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>No sooner had she whispered the words than the baby woke crying. A quarter-hour after that, in came Lyddie with tears in her eyes and two scraped knees. Then an express arrived from Wynterhall, bearing news that meant Toby must leave at once ... some sort of crisis with the sheep.</p><p>Their afternoon idyll was over, the perfect enchantment broken\u2014</p><p>But the love remained, beneath it all. Always. </p> </body></html>"]
