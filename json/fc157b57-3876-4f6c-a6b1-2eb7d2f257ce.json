Though her architecture and streets called to him, they did so with hollow voices. It was as if a great light had been extinguished, not just from the city, but from the world.</p> <p>\u201cQuomodo sedet sola civitas plena populo! Facta est quasi vidua domina gentium . . .\u201d</p><p>His eyes scanned the Lamentation he\u2019d quoted only moments previous. The words of the prophet Jeremiah were woefully inadequate.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice,\u201d he whispered, his heart seizing in his chest. Even now, two years after her death, he had difficulty writing about his loss.</p><p>She would remain forever young, forever noble, forever his blessedness, and not all the poetry in the world could express his devotion to her. But for the sake of her memory and their love, he would try.</p><p>Chapter One</p> <p>June 2011</p><p>Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania</p><p>Professor Gabriel Emerson stood in the doorway of his study, hands in his pockets, gazing on his wife with no little heat. His tall, athletic form was striking, as were his rugged features and sapphire eyes.</p><p>He\u2019d met her when she was seventeen (ten years his junior) and fallen in love with her. They\u2019d been separated by time and circumstances, not least of which was his indulgent lifestyle.</p><p>Yet Heaven smiled on them. She became his graduate student in Toronto six years later and they\u2019d rekindled their affection, marrying a year and a half after that. Almost six months into their marriage he loved her even more than before. He envied the very air she breathed.</p><p>He\u2019d waited long enough for what he was about to do. It was possible she\u2019d need to be seduced, but Gabriel prided himself in his expertise at seduction.</p> <p>The strains of Bruce Cockburn\u2019s song \u201cMango\u201d floated in the air, casting his memory back to their trip to Belize before they were married. They\u2019d made love outside in a variety of places, including the beach.</p><p>Julia sat at a desk, oblivious to the music and his scrutiny. She was typing on her laptop, surrounded by books, file folders, and two boxes of papers Gabriel had dutifully carried from the downstairs of what had been his parents\u2019 house.</p><p>They\u2019d been resident in Selinsgrove a week\u2014a respite from their busy lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Gabriel was a professor at Boston University while Julia had just finished her first year of a PhD at Harvard, under the supervision of a brilliant scholar, formerly of Oxford. They\u2019d fled Cambridge because their home in Harvard Square was in upheaval, as an addition to the house was under construction.</p><p>The Clark house in Selinsgrove had been renovated to accord with Gabriel\u2019s exacting standards prior to their arrival. Much of the furniture left behind by Richard, Gabriel\u2019s adoptive father, had been placed in storage.</p><p>Julia had chosen new furniture and curtains and persuaded Gabriel to help her paint the walls. Whereas his aesthetic ran to dark wood and rich, brown leather, Julia preferred the light colors of a seaside cottage, with whitewashed walls and furniture, accented with various shades of Santorini blue.</p><p>In the study, she\u2019d hung reproductions of paintings that were displayed in their house in Harvard Square\u2014Henry Holiday\u2019s Dante Meets Beatrice at Ponte Santa Trinita, Botticelli\u2019s Primavera, and Madonna and Child with Angels by Fra Filippo Lippi. Gabriel found himself staring at the latter painting intently.</p><p>It could be said that the paintings illustrated the stages of their relationship. The first figured their meeting and Gabriel\u2019s increasing obsession. The second represented Cupid\u2019s arrow, striking Julia when he no longer remembered her, and also their courtship and subsequent marriage. Finally, the painting of the Madonna represented what Gabriel hoped might be.</p><p>This was the third evening Julia had spent at her desk, writing her first public lecture, which she would deliver at Oxford next month. Four days ago, they\u2019d made love on the bedroom floor, covered in paint, before the furniture had been delivered.</p> <p>(Julia had decided that body painting with Gabriel was her new favorite sport.)</p><p>With memories of their physical connection in mind, and the music increasing its tempo, Gabriel\u2019s patience had come to an end. They were newlyweds. He had no intention of allowing her to ignore him for another evening.</p><p>He prowled over to her, his footfalls silent. He moved her shoulder-length hair aside, exposing her neck. The slight stubble of his unshaved face rasped against her skin, intensifying his kisses.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Goose pimples rose on her skin. His long, thin fingers traced the arch of her neck as he waited.</p><p>\u201cMy lecture isn\u2019t finished.\u201d She lifted her pretty face to look at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass Professor Picton, especially when she invited me. I\u2019m the youngest person on the program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t embarrass her. And you\u2019ll have plenty of time to finish the lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get the house ready for your family. They\u2019re arriving in two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t my family.\u201d Gabriel gave her a blazing look. \u201cThey\u2019re our family. And I\u2019ll hire a maid. Come. Bring the blanket.\u201d</p><p>Julia turned and saw a familiar-looking plaid blanket resting on the white overstuffed chair that sat under the window. She peered out into the woods that bordered the backyard. \u201cIt\u2019s dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201d He helped her to her feet, clasping his arms momentarily around her waist and bringing their chests together.</p><p>She felt his warmth through the thin material of her sundress, the temperature comforting and alluring.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to visit the orchard in the dark?\u201d she teased, pulling his glasses from his face and placing them on the desk.</p><p>Gabriel fixed her with a look that would have melted snow. Then he brought his lips to her ear. \u201cI want to see your naked skin glow in the moonlight while I\u2019m inside you.\u201d</p><p>He drew part of her earlobe into his mouth, nibbling it gently. He began to explore her neck, kissing and nipping as her heart rate increased.</p><p>\u201cA declaration of desire,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Julia gave herself over to the sensations, finally becoming conscious of the music in the air. Gabriel\u2019s scent, a mixture of peppermint and Aramis, filled her nostrils.</p><p>He released her, watching her the way a cat watches a mouse, as she picked up the blanket.</p><p>\u201cI suppose Guido da Montefeltro can wait.\u201d She glanced down at her notes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been dead over seven hundred years. I\u2019d say he\u2019s practiced at waiting.\u201d</p><p>Julia returned his smile, shifting the blanket so that she could take his proffered hand.</p><p>As they journeyed downstairs and across the yard, his expression grew playful.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever made love in an orchard before?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m glad I\u2019m your first.\u201d</p><p>She tightened her grip on his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re my last, Gabriel. My only.\u201d</p><p>He quickened his pace, switching on the flashlight as they entered the woods behind the house. He led the way, navigating over roots and uneven ground.</p><p>It was June in Pennsylvania and very warm. The woods were thick and the canopy of leaves blocked much of the light from the moon and the stars. The air was alive with the evening song of birds and the sound of katydids.</p><p>Soon they were entering the clearing. Wildflowers littered the expanse of green. At the far edge of the area stood several aged apple trees. Extending back into the remains of the old orchard, the new trees that Gabriel had planted were spreading their boughs toward the sky.</p><p>As they walked to the center of the clearing, his body relaxed. Something about this space, sacred or otherwise, always soothed him.</p><p>Julia watched as he spread the blanket carefully over the thick grass, then turned off the flashlight. Darkness wrapped around them like a velvet cloak.</p><p>Overhead, the full moon shone, its pale face occasionally muted by wisps of cloud. A clutch of stars twinkled above them.</p><p>Gabriel brushed his hands up and down her arms before tracing the modest neckline of her sundress.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He took his time admiring his wife\u2019s beauty, visible even in the shadows: the arch of her cheekbones, the pout of her mouth, her large, expressive eyes. He lifted her chin and brought their lips together.</p><p>It was the kiss of an ardent lover, communicating with his mouth that he desired her. Gabriel pressed his tall body against her petite one, his fingers tangling in her soft brown hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat if someone sees us?\u201d she panted, before slipping her tongue into his mouth.</p><p>She explored him earnestly until he retreated.</p><p>\u201cThese woods are private. And as you mentioned, it\u2019s dark.\u201d His hands found her waist, spanning her lower back.</p><p>He traced the space where her dimples lay, as if they were landmarks that pleased him, before sliding up to her shoulders. Without ceremony, he slowly removed her dress, dropping it to the blanket. Then he unfastened her bra with a mere flick of his fingers.</p><p>She giggled at his practiced move, while holding the bra up to cover herself. It was made of black lace and was attractively transparent.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good at that,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cAt what?\u201d His large hands moved to cup her breasts over her bra.</p><p>\u201cAt removing bras in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s silence echoed around them. He didn\u2019t like being reminded of his past.</p><p>She reached up on tiptoes to press a kiss to his angular jaw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining. After all, I\u2019m the beneficiary of your skill.\u201d</p><p>At this, he traced her breasts through the lace.</p><p>\u201cWhile I appreciate your lingerie, Julianne, I prefer you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about this.\u201d She peered over his shoulder, scanning the perimeter of the clearing. \u201cI keep expecting someone to interrupt us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one here but us. And what I see is breathtaking.\u201d</p><p>With another provocative move, his hands left her breasts to trace the hills and valleys of her spine before covering her hips. His thumbs hovered over her skin. \u201cI\u2019ll cover you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what? The blanket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my body. Even if someone were to stumble upon us, I won\u2019t let anyone see you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The edges of her lips turned up.</p><p>\u201cYou think of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI simply think of you. You are everything.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel took her offered lips and with great restraint slowly peeled the lace bra away from her body. He kissed her deeply, languidly exploring her mouth, before tugging her panties down.</p><p>Now she was naked before him in their orchard.</p><p>O gods of all orchard sex, she thought. Please don\u2019t let anyone interrupt us.</p><p>She removed his shirt eagerly, her fingers playing in the few strands of chest hair before sliding over his abdominal muscles to unbuckle his belt.</p><p>When they were both naked, he wrapped his arms around her and she breathed out a sigh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s warm tonight,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe only brought one blanket.\u201d</p><p>With a smile she lowered herself to the ground and he covered her with his body. His blue eyes bore into hers as he placed a hand on either side of her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2018To the Nuptial Bowre I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav\u2019n,</p><p>And happie Constellations on that houre.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cParadise Lost,\u201d she whispered, stroking the stubble on his chin. \u201cBut in this place, I can only think of Paradise found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have been married here. We should have made love here for the first time.\u201d</p> <p>She ran her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where I discovered true beauty.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, his hands gently exploring. Julia reciprocated, and their passion kindled and burned.</p><p>In the months since their marriage, their desire had not abated, nor had the sweetness of their coupling. All speech melted into motion and touch and the bliss of physical love.</p> <p>Gabriel knew his wife\u2014he knew her arousal and excitement, her impatience and release. They made love in the night air surrounded by darkness and the greenness of life.</p><p>At the edge of the clearing, the old apple trees that had observed their chaste love in the past politely averted their gaze.</p><p>When at last they\u2019d caught their breaths, Julia lay weightless, admiring the stars.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you.\u201d He felt around for the flashlight and used it to locate his trousers. When he returned to her side he slipped something cool around her neck.</p><p>Julia glanced down to see a necklace made of individual rings. Three charms hung from the necklace\u2014a heart, an apple, and a book.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d She breathed, fingering the charms one by one.</p> <p>\u201cIt came from London. The rings and charms are silver, except for the apple, which is made of gold. It represents when we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante is engraved on the cover.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him coyly. \u201cIs there a special occasion I\u2019ve forgotten about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just enjoy giving you things.\u201d</p><p>Julia kissed him deeply and he moved her to her back, once again putting the flashlight aside.</p><p>When they separated, he placed his palm against her flat stomach and brought his lips to the indentation that lay just beyond his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI want to plant my child here.\u201d</p> <p>As his words echoed in the clearing, Julia froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to have a child with you.\u201d</p><p>She caught her breath. \u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>His thumb moved over her skin. \u201cWe never know how much time we have.\u201d</p><p>Julia thought of Grace, his adoptive mother, and of her biological mother, Sharon. Both died at younger ages, but under very different circumstances.</p><p>\u201cDante lost Beatrice when she was twenty-four,\u201d he continued. \u201cLosing you would be devastating.\u201d</p><p>Julia reached up to touch the slight dimple in his chin. \u201cNo morbid talk. Not here, after we\u2019ve celebrated life and love.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel spread repentant kisses across her abdomen before reclining on his side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve almost outlived Beatrice and I\u2019m healthy.\u201d She placed her hand on his chest, over his tattoo, and touched the name on the bleeding heart. \u201cIs your anxiety because of Maia?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s features tightened. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right if it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that too.\u201d Julia hesitated, as if she were going to say something more.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about Sharon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t a good role model as a mother.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward to brush his lips against hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be an excellent mother. You\u2019re loving, patient, and kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d figure it out together. I\u2019m the one who should be worried. My biological parents were the definition of dysfunctional, and I haven\u2019t exactly lived a sterling moral life.\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re very good with Tammy\u2019s little boy. Even your brother says so. But it\u2019s too soon for a baby, Gabriel. We\u2019ve only been married six months. And I want to finish my PhD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agreed to that, if you remember.\u201d He traced the arch of her ribs with a single finger.</p><p>\u201cMarried life is wonderful, but it\u2019s been an adjustment. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>He paused his movements. \u201cAgreed. But we need to talk about the future. It would be best if I began having conversations with my doctor sooner rather than later. It\u2019s been so long since my vasectomy, a reversal might not be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one way to make a family. We can discuss other medical options. We could adopt a child from the Franciscan orphanage in Florence. When the time is right.\u201d Her expression grew hopeful.</p><p>He smoothed a lock of hair away from her face. \u201cWe can do all those things. I intend to take you to Umbria after the conference, before we go to the exhibition in Florence. But when we get back from Europe, I\u2019d like to speak to my doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her on top of him. A strange charge seemed to jump between their skin as he gripped her hips.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll start trying.\u201d</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably practice a lot in preparation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Julia startled awake early the next morning. Dawn had yet to break and the bedroom was quiet, the silence broken only by the sound of Gabriel\u2019s rhythmic breathing and the distant chattering of birds outside.</p><p>She clutched the sheet to her naked chest and closed her eyes, forcing her breathing to slow. The act only brought the scenes from her nightmare into stark relief.</p><p>She\u2019d been at Harvard, running across campus to find the location of her general exam for her PhD. She stopped person after person, begging for help, but no one seemed to know where the exam was being held.</p><p>She heard the sounds of crying and was shocked to find an infant in her arms. She clutched the child to her chest, trying to shush him, but he wouldn\u2019t stop crying.</p><p>Suddenly, she was standing in front of Professor Matthews, the chair of her department. A large sign at his left indicated that the general exam was taking place in the classroom behind him. He blocked the doorway, telling her that children weren\u2019t allowed.</p><p>She argued. She promised she\u2019d keep the baby from crying. She begged him to give her a chance. All her hopes and dreams of completing her PhD and becoming a Dante specialist rested on the exam. Without it, she\u2019d be dismissed from the program.</p><p>At that moment, the infant in her arms began to wail. Professor Matthews scowled, pointing to the stairwell nearby and ordering her to leave.</p><p>An arm reached across her body, hugging her. She looked down to see that Gabriel was still asleep. Something in his unconscious state must have prompted him to comfort her. She watched him with a mixture of love and anxiety, her body still trembling from the nightmare.</p><p>She stumbled to the bathroom and switched on the lights and the shower. She hoped the hot water would calm her. Certainly, the brightness of the bathroom helped dispel some the darkness.</p><p>As she stood under the tropical rain shower, she tried to forget the nightmare and the other worries that fought to breach the surface of her consciousness\u2014her lecture, their family\u2019s impending visit, Gabriel\u2019s sudden urge to have a baby . . .</p><p>Her fingers went to the silver necklace clasped around her throat. She knew that Gabriel wanted children with her. They\u2019d discussed it prior to their engagement. But they\u2019d agreed to wait until she graduated. Graduation was still a good five or six years away.</p><p>Why is he bringing up the subject of children now?</p><p>She was anxious enough over her studies. Come September, she\u2019d be taking courses and looking ahead to her general exams, which would have to be completed the following year.</p><p>More pressing was her lecture, which was to be delivered at Oxford in a few weeks. Julia had completed a paper on Guido da Montefeltro in Professor Marinelli\u2019s graduate seminar that past semester. The professor liked the paper so much, she\u2019d mentioned it to Professor Picton, who encouraged Julia to submit an abstract to the conference.</p><p>Julia had been overjoyed when her paper proposal was accepted. But the thought of standing in front of a room of Dante specialists and lecturing them on topics they were far more expert in was daunting.</p><p>Now Gabriel was talking about having his vasectomy reversed when they returned from Europe in August.</p><p>What if the vasectomy reversal is successful?</p><p>Guilt washed over her. Of course she wanted to have his child. And she knew that undoing the vasectomy was more than just a physical procedure. It would be a symbolic gesture\u2014that he\u2019d finally forgiven himself for what happened with Paulina and Maia. That he\u2019d finally begun to believe that he was worthy of fathering and parenting children.</p><p>They\u2019d prayed for children. After their wedding, they\u2019d approached the tomb of St. Francis and said spontaneous, private prayers, asking for God\u2019s blessing on their marriage and the gift of children.</p><p>If God wants to answer our prayers, how can I say, \u201cWait\u201d?</p><p>Julia worried she was being selfish. Maybe she should prioritize having a child over her education and aspirations. Harvard wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Lots of people went back to university after starting a family.</p><p>What if Gabriel doesn\u2019t want to wait?</p><p>He was correct to point out that life was short. The loss of Grace was testament to that. Once Gabriel knew he was able to father a child, he\u2019d probably want to do so immediately. How could she say no?</p><p>Gabriel was a consuming fire. His passion, his desires, all seemed to overtake the desires of those around him. He\u2019d told her once that she was the only woman who\u2019d ever said no to him. He was probably correct.</p><p>Julia worried about her ability to say no to his deepest longing. She\u2019d be overwhelmed with the desire to please him, to make him happy, and in so doing would sacrifice her own happiness.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had much growing up. She\u2019d been poor and neglected when she lived with Sharon in St. Louis. But she\u2019d distinguished herself in school. Her intelligence and discipline had served her well through Saint Joseph\u2019s University and the University of Toronto.</p><p>Her first year at Harvard had been successful. Now was not the time to quit or drop out. Now was not the time to have a child.</p><p>Julia covered her face with her hands and prayed for strength.</p><p>A few hours later, Gabriel walked into the kitchen, carrying his running shoes and socks. He was clad in a Harvard T-shirt and shorts and was about to retrieve a bottle of water from the fridge when he saw Julia sitting at the kitchen island, her head in her hands.</p><p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d He dropped his shoes and socks to the floor and greeted her with an insistent kiss. \u201cI wondered where you\u2019d gone.\u201d</p><p>He remarked her tired eyes and the purple smudges below them. She looked distressed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just finished cleaning the kitchen and the fridge, and now I\u2019m making a list for the grocery store.\u201d She pointed to a large piece of paper that was covered in her flowing script. It sat next to a cup of coffee that was stone cold and half empty, along with another equally long list of to-do items. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel looked around at the kitchen, which was sparkling within an inch of its life. Even the floors were immaculate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s seven o\u2019clock. Isn\u2019t it a bit early for housekeeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lot to do.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound enthusiastic.</p><p>Gabriel took her hand, stroking his thumb across her palm. \u201cYou look tired. Didn\u2019t you sleep well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI woke up early and couldn\u2019t get back to sleep. I need to make up the bedrooms and clean the bathrooms. Then I need to go shopping and plan the meals. And . . .\u201d She heaved a shuddering sigh.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he prompted, lowering his head so he could meet her eyes, which had moved to the long to-do list.</p><p>\u201cI need to keep moving. I\u2019m not even dressed.\u201d She tugged the edges of her pale blue silk bathrobe together and moved to stand.</p><p>Gabriel stopped her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anything. I said I\u2019d find someone to clean the house, and I will.\u201d He gestured to the grocery list. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the store after my run.\u201d</p> <p>Her shoulders relaxed slightly. \u201cThat will help. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek with his hand. \u201cGo back to bed. You look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still too much to do,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look after it. You need to work on your lecture.\u201d He offered her a half-smile. \u201cBut get some sleep first. A tired mind doesn\u2019t work very well.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her once again and led her upstairs. He pulled the covers back on their bed and watched her settle before tucking her in.</p><p>\u201cI know this is the first time we\u2019ve had houseguests. I don\u2019t expect you to be the maid. And I certainly don\u2019t want our relatives to keep you from meeting your deadline. Work in the study for the rest of the day. Forget about everything else. I\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p> <p>He pressed his lips to her forehead and turned out the light, leaving Julia to her slumber.</p><p>Gabriel usually listened to music when he jogged, but on this morning his mind was distracted. Julianne was overwhelmed; it was obvious. She wasn\u2019t an early riser and from the looks of her this morning, she\u2019d been awake for hours.</p><p>They probably shouldn\u2019t have invited their relatives to visit prior to her conference. But since they were going to Italy for most of the summer, this was the only time everyone could be together.</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten how time consuming it was to have company. He\u2019d never entertained more than one or two people at a time, and then only with the support of a housekeeper and a bank account that permitted him to take his guests out for meals.</p><p>Poor Julianne. Gabriel recalled his own years at Harvard: how vacations were never true holidays since there was always work to do, languages to learn, and exams to prepare for.</p><p>He was relieved to be tenured. He wouldn\u2019t trade places with Julia for anything. Especially since he\u2019d coped with the pressures of grad school by drinking, doing cocaine and P\u2014</p><p>Gabriel stumbled, pitching forward as the toe of his shoe caught on the sidewalk. He righted himself quickly and regained his stride, forcing himself to concentrate on his steps.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like to think about his years at Harvard. Since his move back to Cambridge, he\u2019d experienced drug flashbacks so vivid, he would swear he could feel the cocaine entering his nostrils. He\u2019d drive down a street or enter a building on the Harvard campus and feel a craving that was so sharp it was painful.</p> <p>Thus far, with the grace of God, he\u2019d resisted. Certainly, his weekly Narcotics Anonymous meetings had helped, as had his monthly appointments with his therapist.</p><p>And then, of course, there was Julianne.</p><p>If Gabriel found his higher power in Assisi last year, Julianne was his guardian angel. She loved him, inspired him, made his house a home. But he could not shake the fear that Heaven had smiled on him only to bide its time before snatching her away.</p><p>Gabriel had changed in myriad ways since Julianne was his student. But he had yet to abandon his belief that he was not worthy of sustained happiness. As his therapist had warned, Gabriel had a pattern of self-sabotage.</p><p>His adoptive mother, Grace, had died of cancer almost two years previous. Her untimely death symbolized the shortness and uncertainty of life. If he were to lose Julianne . . .</p><p>If you had a child with her, you\u2019d never lose her.</p><p>A still, small voice spoke in his ear.</p><p>Gabriel quickened his pace. The voice was right, but it didn\u2019t express his primary motivation for wanting a baby with Julianne. He wanted a family that included children\u2014a life filled with laughter and the knowledge that he could right the wrongs done by his own parents.</p><p>He\u2019d kept his internal struggles from his wife. She was burdened with her own concerns and he was loath to add to them. She\u2019d worry about his addictions and his fears, and he\u2019d already given her too much anguish.</p><p>While Gabriel jogged the familiar circuit of his old neighborhood, he began to wonder why she\u2019d been so dispirited this morning. They\u2019d spent an incredible night together, celebrating their love in the orchard and later, in bed. He racked his brain, trying to figure out if he\u2019d done something to hurt her. But their lovemaking had been, as usual, both passionate and tender.</p><p>There was at least one other possibility, and Gabriel cursed himself for not having thought of it sooner. Julianne always carried with her a degree of anxiety about being back in Selinsgrove. A year and a half ago, her ex-boyfriend, Simon, had broken into her father\u2019s home and assaulted her. Subsequently, his current girlfriend, Natalie, had confronted Julia at a local diner, threatening to release lewd pictures of her if she didn\u2019t withdraw her assault complaint.</p><p>Julianne had convinced Natalie that it was not in her interest to release the pictures, since they\u2019d implicate Simon, as well. His father was a U.S. senator who was running for president, and Natalie was working for his campaign.</p><p>At the time, Gabriel kept his doubts about Julia\u2019s success to himself. He knew that once a person acquired a taste for blackmail, he or she would keep trying to draw from that well.</p><p>Gabriel cursed again, now running at a punishing rate of speed. He\u2019d never told Julia what he\u2019d done. He didn\u2019t want to do so now. But if she was worrying about Simon and Natalie, then perhaps it was time to tell her the truth . . .</p><p>When Gabriel returned from his run, Julia was sleeping. He chuckled, noticing that her bare feet were sticking out from under the covers. Julia didn\u2019t like it when her feet grew hot and so she\u2019d bare them to the air while snuggled under several blankets.</p><p>Leaning over, he tucked the covers around her feet and walked to the shower. After he dressed he checked on her, but she was still asleep. He hurried down the stairs, grabbing her lists from the kitchen and heading to the Range Rover. With any luck, he\u2019d be able to complete the shopping and secure a maid before she awoke.</p><p>At eleven o\u2019clock that evening, Julia finally descended the stairs from the second floor. She found Gabriel seated in the living room, reading. He was in a leather club chair, his feet resting on a footstool, his eyes moving behind his glasses.</p><p>\u201cWhy, hello there.\u201d He greeted her with a smile, closing his book.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>He showed her the cover. The Way of a Pilgrim.</p><p>\u201cIs it good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. Did you ever read J.D. Salinger\u2019s Franny and Zooey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long time ago. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFranny reads this book and it troubles her. That\u2019s where I first heard about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d She picked up the book, glancing at the back cover.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about a Russian Orthodox man who tries to learn what it means to pray without ceasing.\u201d</p><p>Julia arched an eyebrow. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m reading it to discover what he learned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you praying for something?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed at his chin. \u201cI\u2019m praying for a good many things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me to become a good man, a good husband, and, someday, a good father.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little and looked at the book again. \u201cI suppose we\u2019re all on our own spiritual journeys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of us are further along than others.\u201d</p><p>She put the book down and climbed into his lap. \u201cI don\u2019t think of it that way. I think we chase God until He catches us.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel chuckled. \u201cLike The Hound of Heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the things I admire most about you is your compassion for human frailty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my own vices, Gabriel. They\u2019re just hidden.\u201d</p><p>She looked around the room, noting the vacuum marks in the carpet and the freshly dusted furniture. The air smelled of lemon and pine.</p><p>\u201cThe house looks great. Thank you for finding someone else to clean it. I was able to get a lot of work done today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He looked at her over the rims of his glasses. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better. Thanks for making dinner.\u201d She rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t hungry when I brought it up to you.\u201d He ran his fingers through her hair.</p><p>\u201cI finished it eventually. I ran into a problem with my paper, so I had trouble stopping long enough to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d He removed his glasses, resting them on top of his book.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want people thinking that you\u2019re the brains behind my research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was offering.\u201d Gabriel sounded offended.</p><p>\u201cI need to do this myself.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed. \u201cI think you worry a little too much about what other people think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cIf I present a paper that sounds like you wrote it, people will notice. Christa Peterson has already been spreading rumors about us. Paul told me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled. \u201cChrista is a jealous bitch. She\u2019s going backward in her career, not forward. Columbia made her enroll in the M.Phil program in Italian. They wouldn\u2019t admit her directly into their PhD. I\u2019ve already spoken to the head of her department at Columbia. She slanders us at her peril.\u201d He shifted in his chair. \u201cAnd when were you speaking to Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe emailed me after the conference he went to at UCLA. That\u2019s where he saw Christa and heard the rumors she was spreading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even let me read your paper. Although we\u2019ve discussed Guido so much I\u2019m sure I know what you\u2019ll say.\u201d</p><p>Julia chewed on the edge of her thumbnail but said nothing.</p><p>He hugged her more closely.</p><p>\u201cHas my book been helpful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m taking a different tack,\u201d she hedged.</p><p>\u201cThat can be a double-edged sword, Julianne. Originality is admired, but sometimes established methods are established for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you read it tomorrow, if you have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll have time.\u201d He began rubbing her back, up and down. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m looking forward to it. My goal is to help you, not hurt you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She kissed him again before burrowing against his chest. \u201cI just worry about what you\u2019ll think.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, but supportive. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best I can hope for.\u201d She smiled up at him. \u201cNow I need you to take me to bed and cheer me up.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed thoughtfully. \u201cWhat would cheering you up entail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking my mind off my troubles by tantalizing me with your naked body.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not ready for bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll have to go to bed by myself. And maybe cheer myself up.\u201d She stood and stretched, glancing at him out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>In a flash he was behind her, scooping her into his arms and racing for the stairs.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>You can\u2019t present this.\u201d Gabriel strode into the study the following afternoon, clutching a printout of Julia\u2019s lecture.</p> <p>She looked up from her laptop in horror. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d He set the pages down and pulled off his glasses, tossing them on top of her desk. \u201cSt. Francis comes for the soul of Guido da Montefeltro after he dies. We discussed this. You agreed with me.\u201d</p><p>Julia crossed her arms defensively.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the only interpretation that makes sense!\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, shaking her head.</p> <p>He began to pace in front of her desk.</p><p>\u201cWe talked about this in Belize. I sent you an illustration of the scene while we were separated, for God\u2019s sake! Now you\u2019re going to stand in front of a room full of people and say that it never happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d read my footnotes, you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped pacing and turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cI read the footnotes. None of those sources go as far as you. You\u2019re merely speculating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerely?\u201d Julia pushed back from her desk. \u201cI found several reputable sources that agree with most of what I say. Professor Marinelli liked my paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too easy on you.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cToo easy? And I suppose you think that Professor Picton invited me to the conference merely out of charity?\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s expression softened. \u201cOf course not. She thinks well of you. But I don\u2019t want you to get up in front of a crowd of senior professors and offer a na\u00efve interpretation. If you\u2019d read my book, you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read your book, Professor Emerson. You only mention the text I\u2019m analyzing in passing. And you na\u00efvely adopt the standard interpretation, without reflecting on whether you should.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI accept the interpretation that makes sense.\u201d His tone was glacial. \u201cI never na\u00efvely adopt anything.\u201d</p><p>Julia stood, huffing in frustration.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want me to have my own ideas? Or do you think I have to repeat what everyone else has already said just because I\u2019m a lowly grad student?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face reddened. \u201cI never said that. I was a grad student once, too, if you\u2019ll recall. But I\u2019m not anymore. You could benefit from my experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, here we go.\u201d Julia threw up her hands in disgust and walked out of the study.</p><p>Gabriel followed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, here we go?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother turning around.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just upset that I\u2019m going to disagree with you in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit?\u201d She turned around. \u201cThen why are you telling me to change my paper so I fall in line with your book?\u201d</p><p>He placed a hand on her arm. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to get you to fall in line. I\u2019m trying to help so that you won\u2019t make a fool\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d She shook off his hand.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he appeared calmer. \u201cIf you start now, you should be able to rewrite your paper in time for the conference. I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your help. And I can\u2019t change my thesis. They\u2019ve already published the abstract on the conference website.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Katherine.\u201d He gave her an encouraging smile. \u201cShe\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. I\u2019m not changing it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s lips pressed together into a thin line.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the time to be stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, it is. It\u2019s my paper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulianne, listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried I\u2019ll make a fool of myself. And embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look that was wounded if not betrayed. \u201cYou just did.\u201d</p><p>She stalked into the bedroom, attempting to close the door behind her. His hand shot out, stopping the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulianne, stop.\u201d He gazed around helplessly. \u201cWe can talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not your student anymore. I\u2019m allowed to have my own ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I was saying at all.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him and walked toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cJulianne, damn it. Stop!\u201d he bellowed from the doorway.</p><p>She whirled around.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yell at me!\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up in an expression of surrender and drew a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s sit down and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk to you right now without saying something I\u2019ll regret. And you obviously need to cool down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the bathroom. I\u2019m locking the door and I\u2019m going to avoid you for the rest of the day. If you don\u2019t leave me alone, I\u2019m going to my dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel winced. She hadn\u2019t stayed with her father since before they were married.</p><p>\u201cHow would you get there?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t leave you without a car. I\u2019ll call a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any cabs in town. You\u2019ll have to call one in Sunbury.\u201d</p><p>Julia glared. \u201cI know that, Gabriel. I used to live here, remember? You must really think I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>She walked into the bathroom, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>Gabriel heard the lock click into place.</p><p>He paused for a moment before knocking on the door. \u201cRachel, Aaron, and Richard are arriving soon. What will I tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them I\u2019m an idiot. Obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulianne, just listen to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>He heard water running from behind the door.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d He shouted. \u201cAvoid me. Our first fight and you lock yourself in the God damned bathroom.\u201d He smacked his palm against the door.</p><p>Abruptly, the water shut off.</p><p>She raised her voice in order to be heard. \u201cMy first public lecture and you tell me it\u2019s shit. And not because it is, but because I didn\u2019t agree with you and your own God damned book!\u201d</p><p>After a lengthy hot bath, Julia emerged. The bedroom was empty.</p><p>She dressed quickly before entering the hall. She padded over to the staircase, listening.</p><p>Satisfied that the house was empty, she walked to the study and closed the door. Then she sat behind her desk, turned on some soft jazz as background noise, and returned to her paper.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Julia?\u201d Rachel hugged her brother before rolling her small suitcase and that of her husband, Aaron, into the living room. Her tall and willowy form was clad in a pair of khaki pants and a V-necked white T-shirt. Her long blond hair hung straight and perfect, pushed back from her attractive face by large black sunglasses. She looked like she could have starred in a Gap ad.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression tightened.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working on her paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her we arrived?\u201d Rachel moved to the foot of the stairs. \u201cJules! Get your ass down here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel, please,\u201d her father said reprovingly before greeting Gabriel with a hug.</p><p>Richard stood an inch or two shorter than his son and had light hair and gray eyes. He was quiet and serious, and his intelligence and kindness engendered respect in all who knew him.</p><p>When there was no movement upstairs, Rachel turned to her brother, gray eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she hiding?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook Aaron\u2019s hand in greeting. \u201cShe isn\u2019t. She probably didn\u2019t hear you.</p><p>\u201cYour rooms are ready and there are fresh towels in the guest bathroom. Dad, you\u2019re welcome to stay in your old room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine in the guest room.\u201d Richard picked up his bag and began climbing the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAre you and Julia fighting?\u201d Rachel gave Gabriel a suspicious look.</p><p>He pressed his lips together. \u201cYou can say hello when you go upstairs. Then we\u2019ll meet for drinks on the back porch. I\u2019m barbecuing ribs for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRibs? Fantastic.\u201d Aaron clapped an appreciative hand to Gabriel\u2019s back. \u201cI was going to stop to pick up some Corona before we arrived, but Rachel wanted to come straight to the house. I\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his car keys and was about to head to the door when his wife stopped him. She shook her head.</p><p>Gabriel watched the exchange between Rachel and Aaron and decided that was his opportunity to excuse himself.</p><p>\u201cSee you on the patio in a few minutes.\u201d He walked toward the kitchen.</p><p>Rachel shook her head at her husband. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting. I\u2019ll go talk to Jules and you talk to Gabriel. Then you can pick up the Corona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could they be fighting about?\u201d Aaron ran a hand through his dark curly hair.</p><p>\u201cWho knows? Maybe Julia rearranged his collection of bow ties without asking him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Rachel opened the door to her father\u2019s former study.</p><p>Julia greeted her best friend with a wide smile. \u201cRach! Hi.\u201d</p><p>The two women embraced and Rachel settled herself in one of the comfortable chairs by the window.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up with you and Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie like a carpet.\u201d</p><p>Julia turned away. \u201cWhat makes you think something is up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel is downstairs looking unhappy and you\u2019re up here looking unhappy. There\u2019s tension in the house. I don\u2019t need to be a psychic to pick up on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are jerks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t argue with that.\u201d Julia collapsed in the chair opposite her best friend, flinging her legs over the arm.</p><p>\u201cI fight with Aaron, sometimes. He\u2019ll get mad and take off for a couple of hours, but he always comes back.\u201d Rachel looked at her friend carefully. \u201cDo you want me to go and beat Gabriel up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But you\u2019re right. We\u2019re fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made the mistake of letting him read the lecture I\u2019m working on. He told me it\u2019s terrible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe said that?\u201d Rachel sat up in her chair, her voice raised.</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him? I would have thrown something at his head.\u201d</p><p>Julia grinned wryly. \u201cI thought about it, but I didn\u2019t want to have to clean up the blood.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhy does he think your paper is terrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I\u2019m wrong. He said he was trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like Gabriel is trying to control your paper like he tries to control everything else. I thought he was in therapy for that.\u201d</p><p>Julia was quiet for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to lie to me just to spare my feelings. If the paper needs work, I need to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should know how to help you without saying your paper is terrible.\u201d</p><p>Julia exhaled in frustration. \u201cExactly. He says he wants to start a family with me. Then he turns around and acts like a condescending ass.\u201d</p><p>Rachel lifted her hand and gestured for her friend to stop. \u201cWait a minute. He wants to have kids?\u201d</p><p>Julia squirmed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules, that\u2019s huge! I\u2019m so happy for you. When are you going to start trying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot for a while. We agreed to wait until I graduate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long time.\u201d Rachel\u2019s voice grew quiet.</p><p>\u201cIt would be too difficult to work on a PhD and have a baby.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded. She fidgeted with the hem of her T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>Julia moved so that she could see her friend better. \u201cWhat, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know you were ready?\u201d</p> <p>Rachel smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t, really. I\u2019ve always wanted kids, and Aaron feels the same way. We\u2019ve been talking about it since high school. I love Aaron. I would be happy to live with him, just the two of us. But when I envision the future, I see kids. I want us to have someone who will come home for Christmas. If I learned anything from losing my mother, it\u2019s that life is uncertain. I don\u2019t want to wait to start a family and then lose my chance.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt tears threatening, but she blinked them back. \u201cYou have yearly mammograms, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ve had genetic testing. I don\u2019t have the breast cancer gene, but I don\u2019t think Mom had it, either. Even if she did, by the time they would have realized it, it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Rachel sighed and looked out the window. \u201cI don\u2019t like talking about it, but it weighs on me. What happens if we have kids, and I get cancer? It\u2019s always in the back of my mind.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face her friend. \u201cHaving kids is one way to rid Gabriel of his condescending attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be condescending when the baby empties a dirty diaper on him. He\u2019ll be shouting your name, begging for help.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. But all too soon, she grew sober.</p><p>\u201cI just want him to think that my ideas are important. They\u2019re just as important as his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they are. Tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. But right now, I\u2019m not speaking to him.\u201d</p><p>Rachel ran her hand over the armrest, back and forth.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s come a long way. To see him married and talking about starting a family\u2014it\u2019s remarkable. Mom told me that when they first brought Gabriel home, he used to hide food in his room. No matter what they said or did, he pocketed something at every meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was afraid of being hungry. He didn\u2019t trust that Mom and Dad would feed him. So he was building up a reserve for when they stopped. He didn\u2019t unpack his bags, either. Not until after they adopted him. He kept expecting them to send him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d Julia\u2019s heart felt heavy.</p><p>Rachel offered her a sympathetic look. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother and I love him. But he speaks without thinking. His issue with your paper is probably that you didn\u2019t write it the way he would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to write things his way. I have my own ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy advice is to talk to him. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to let him sweat a little. Make him sleep on the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019ll probably be the one on the couch.\u201d Julia pointed to the sofa that stood against the opposite wall.</p><p>To say that dinner was awkward would be an understatement.</p><p>Julia and Gabriel sat side by side. They even held hands during grace. But there was only painful, detached politeness\u2014no warm glances, no whispered words of affection, no fleeting touches under the table.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s spine was ramrod straight, his demeanor cool. Julia was quiet and remote.</p><p>Richard, Aaron, and Rachel kept the conversation fluid while the Emersons barely spoke. After dinner, Julia declined dessert and excused herself to work on her lecture.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes followed her as she left the table, a muscle jumping in his jaw. But he didn\u2019t stop her. He simply watched her walk away.</p><p>When Rachel went to the kitchen to make coffee, Aaron decided that he\u2019d had enough. He leaned across the table.</p><p>\u201cMan, suck it up and tell her you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lifted his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you assuming that I\u2019m at fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the one with a dic\u2014\u201d Aaron caught his father-in-law\u2019s eye and began coughing. \u201cUm, statistically speaking, eighty percent of fights are the guy\u2019s fault. Just apologize and get it over with. I don\u2019t want to have to sit through another meal like that. It\u2019s so cold in here, I\u2019m going to have to go outside to warm up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I have to side with Aaron. Not that you\u2019re asking.\u201d Richard chuckled to himself.</p><p>Gabriel looked between the two men with something akin to disgust.</p><p>\u201cI tried talking to her. That\u2019s how our argument started. She locked herself in the bathroom and told me to get lost.\u201d</p><p>Richard and Aaron exchanged a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Aaron whistled. \u201cYou\u2019d better talk to her before bed or you\u2019re looking at couch time.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head before moving to the kitchen to join his wife.</p><p>Richard tapped the stem of his wine glass thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cEt tu, Brute?\u201d Gabriel scowled.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Richard looked at his son kindly. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a reason why old married couples tell the young ones not to let the sun go down on their anger. Dealing with problems when they\u2019re small will make both of your lives easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t exactly have a conversation through a locked door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. You wooed her once; woo her again.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wore an incredulous expression. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me to woo my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you to let go of your ego, apologize, and then listen to her. I wasn\u2019t always the man you see before you. You can learn from my mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Mom had the perfect marriage.\u201d</p><p>Richard laughed.</p><p>\u201cOur marriage was far from perfect. But we made a pact early on that we would keep the imperfection out of sight and hearing of you children. Children get anxious when their parents argue. In my experience, couples fight over money, sex, and a lack of respect or attention.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel began to protest, but Richard lifted a hand. \u201cI\u2019m not asking what your disagreement was about. That\u2019s between you and your wife. It\u2019s obvious that Julia\u2019s feelings have been hurt. She was very withdrawn over dinner, the way she used to be before she began seeing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who shut down rational communication.\u201d Gabriel sounded imperious.</p><p>\u201cListen to yourself.\u201d Richard\u2019s tone turned scolding. \u201cJulia isn\u2019t irrational. She\u2019s hurt. When someone hurts you, it\u2019s rational to withdraw. Especially considering her history.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grimaced. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true. But I\u2019m also confident that you don\u2019t fight fairly. Learning how to argue with a spouse is an art, not a science. It took your mother and me a long time to figure it out. But once we did, we rarely argued. And when we did, it wasn\u2019t ugly or hurtful. If you can argue with Julia while still convincing her that you love her and that she\u2019s important to you, your conflicts will be easier to manage.\u201d Richard finished his wine and placed the glass on the table.</p><p>\u201cTake it from someone who was married a while and who brought up a daughter. When a woman withdraws and is cold, it\u2019s because she\u2019s protecting herself. My advice is to be gentle with your wife and coax her out of that locked room. Or prepare to spend a lot of lonely nights on the couch.\u201d</p><p>It was after midnight by the time Julia closed her laptop. She knew everyone had gone to bed. She\u2019d heard their footsteps in the hall.</p><p>She crept to the door of the study and opened it. Light shone from underneath the closed door to the master bedroom. No doubt Gabriel was awake, reading.</p><p>She contemplated going to him. But the distance to his bed seemed interminable.</p><p>She grabbed the bottle of bubble bath she\u2019d spirited away from their bathroom after dinner. She\u2019d take another hot bath in the guest bathroom and try to forget her troubles.</p><p>A half hour later, Julia reentered the study, shutting the door behind her. She felt refreshed but only marginally more relaxed. Since Gabriel seemed determined to keep his distance, she\u2019d sleep on the couch.</p><p>As she lay under the old wool blanket they\u2019d first shared so many years ago in the orchard, she thought of their home back in Cambridge. She thought of their first few months of marriage and how happy they\u2019d been.</p><p>She wanted to be a Dante specialist. It was a long road that would require sacrifice, hard work, and humility. She didn\u2019t want to be the kind of person who thought herself above criticism. She knew that her writing needed improvement.</p><p>But when Gabriel said she was going to make a fool out of herself, the pain was excruciating. She needed him to encourage her, to cheer her on. She didn\u2019t need him belittling her. Her belief in herself was shaky enough.</p><p>Why can\u2019t he see that I need his support?</p><p>As her sadness swelled, she wondered why he hadn\u2019t come to her.</p><p>No doubt he\u2019d spent the evening with his family, smoking a cigar on the porch and talking about old times. She wondered what kind of explanation he\u2019d given to Rachel about their conflict. She wondered why she was lying alone in the dark, close to tears, and he seemed perfectly content to leave her to it.</p><p>Just then, she heard a door open down the hall. She heard Gabriel\u2019s quick, determined steps. They stopped outside her door.</p><p>She sat up, holding her breath. A muted light shone from the hallway, entering the study through the crack beneath the door.</p><p>O gods of fighting newlyweds, please make him knock on my door.</p><p>She heard what sounded like a pained sigh and a thump that could have been a hand resting against the door. Then she saw a shadow pass across the light as the footsteps retreated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia tightened into a ball but did not cry.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Very early the next morning, Julia\u2019s cell phone rang.</p><p>She jerked awake, the sound of the Police\u2019s \u201cMessage in a Bottle\u201d reverberating around the room. She stared as the phone vibrated against the desk. But she didn\u2019t answer.</p> <p>A few minutes later she heard a chime, indicating she\u2019d received a text.</p><p>Curiously, she walked over to the desk and picked up her phone. The text was, remarkably, from Dante Alighieri.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>While she was contemplating what to type in response, another text arrived.</p><p>Forgive me.</p> <p>She began formulating a reply when she heard movement in the hallway. Someone rapped on her door.</p><p>Please let me in.</p><p>Julia read the newest text before walking to the door. She opened it a little more than a crack.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Gabriel greeted her with a hesitant smile.</p><p>She gazed at him, noting that his hair was wet from the shower but that he hadn\u2019t shaved. An attractive dark stubble covered his face and he was dressed in a white T-shirt and old jeans, his feet bare. He was, perhaps, the most beautiful sight she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re knocking on my door at six o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d Her tone was colder than she\u2019d intended.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Julianne.\u201d His expression was suitably contrite.</p><p>(It certainly helped that his eyes were bloodshot and his clothes were rumpled, as if he\u2019d simply lifted them out of a bag destined for the Salvation Army and put them on.)</p><p>\u201cYou hurt me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He took a step forward. \u201cI reread your paper.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand on her hip. \u201cYou knocked on my door to tell me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called, but you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIt reminded me of Toronto, when I had to climb through your window.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s cheeks flamed at the memory of Gabriel standing in her backyard in order to bring her dinner, as she greeted him in a towel, fresh from the shower.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot something. Something important.\u201d</p> <p>In his hand, he held the illustration of The Contention for Guido de Montefeltro. \u201cI found it on the floor of the bedroom last night. I\u2019m not sure which one of us was carrying it, but someone dropped it.\u201d</p><p>Julia ignored the illustration that he\u2019d left in her mailbox back in Toronto and searched his expression, instead. He appeared agitated, a sharp worry visible in his eyes. He ran his fingers through his wet hair.</p><p>\u201cI know you needed to get away from me, but I think we\u2019ve been separated long enough. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>Julia stepped back.</p><p>He entered and she closed the door behind him.</p><p>She crossed over to the couch and curled up on it, wrapping the old blanket around her shoulders.</p><p>He watched her movements, noticing that her body was now curved into a protective ball. He placed the illustration on top of her computer and shoved his hands into his pockets.</p><p>\u201cI read your paper again. I also went back to the Inferno.\u201d His eyes met hers. \u201cI said some things yesterday I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her posture relaxed somewhat.</p><p>\u201cI have some suggestions to improve your paper.\u201d He leaned back against the desk, resting his hips against the edge. \u201cI know it\u2019s important that you stand on your own two feet. But I\u2019m happy to help, if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d welcome your advice, as long as you don\u2019t tell me what to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never tell you what to think. How could I?\u201d His face grew gentle. \u201cYour ideas are one of the many things I love about you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes fell to the illustration.</p><p>\u201cI overreacted. I apologize. But the subject of your paper is somewhat personal, Julianne. The story of Francis risking Hell to save Guido\u2019s soul represents what I was trying to do when I made my confession to the disciplinary committee back in Toronto.\u201d</p><p>A lump appeared in Julia\u2019s throat. She didn\u2019t like thinking about what had happened the previous year. The disciplinary committee and their subsequent separation were far too painful to dwell on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t merely reacting to your thesis. I was reacting to what I took to be your dismissal of the story. Our story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant to dismiss something so important. I know you risked everything to help me. I know you went through Hell.\u201d Her features grew determined. \u201cIf the situation had been reversed, I would have descended to Hell to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>A smile pulled at the edges of Gabriel\u2019s lips. \u201cBeatrice knew she couldn\u2019t accompany Dante through Hell, so she sent Virgil, instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only Virgil I know is Paul Norris. I doubt you would have welcomed his help.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel snorted. \u201cPaul is hardly a candidate for Virgil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was for me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled, for the thought of Paul comforting Julia in his absence still rankled.</p><p>\u201cI was a bastard. Then and now.\u201d He pushed off the desk and stood in front of her, taking his hands out of his pockets.</p><p>He glanced at the space next to her. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He sat beside her and held out his hand. She took it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry, too.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her onto his lap and buried his nose in her hair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to lock yourself in the bathroom to get away from me.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face and pressed their lips together. After an instant, she responded.</p><p>Gabriel kissed her with restraint, his lips warm and inviting. Back and forth and back and forth, he teased and nibbled at her mouth. Finally, she wrapped her hand around his neck, urging him closer.</p><p>He traced the seam of her mouth with his tongue. When she opened, he gently slipped inside, touching their tongues together. He\u2019d never been able to lie with his kisses. They communicated far too much of his feelings. Julia felt his contrition and his sadness, but she also felt the undiminished flame of his desire.</p><p>His palms slid from her face to her hips, lifting her until she was straddling him. Their upper bodies pressed together as they continued to embrace, mouths eager and exploring.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice was a husky plea as he cupped her backside, pushing her over the evidence of his arousal.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He brought his lips to her ear. \u201cWe still have time to make up properly before our houseguests expect breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Julia pulled away. \u201cWe can\u2019t make up properly with guests in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes we can.\u201d His blue eyes glinted dangerously. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night was terrible.\u201d Gabriel lay on his back, one of his arms behind his head. He hadn\u2019t bothered to cover himself. Their bedroom was warm and his beloved wife was lying next to him on her stomach, equally naked. In moments like this he wished they could spend their days in bed, unclothed.</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Julia lifted herself on her forearms so she could see his eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come and talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to read your paper again. And I thought you needed space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like fighting with you.\u201d Julia ducked her head, the strands of her hair skimming the tops of her breasts. \u201cI hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it either, which is surprising, really. I used to love to fight.\u201d His lips curled into a pout. \u201cYou\u2019re turning me into a pacifist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll ever be a pacifist, Gabriel.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice wobbled. \u201cBeing a grad student is hard enough. I need your support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have it,\u201d he whispered fiercely.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t set out to disagree with you in my paper. It just sort of\u2014happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Julia stretched out on top of him and he placed his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cWe need to figure out a way to disagree without having a repeat of yesterday. My heart can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can mine,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI promise not to be a selfish bastard, if you promise not to lock yourself in the bathroom.\u201d His eyes bore into hers.</p><p>\u201cI promise not to lock myself in the bathroom, if you can give me space. I was trying to get away from you while things were escalating. You wouldn\u2019t let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken. We can take a break during an argument, but we have to promise to talk later on. And not the next morning. I\u2019m not letting you, or myself, sleep on the couch again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. The couch is very uncomfortable. And lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t express myself very well when we talked about your paper. I\u2019m sorry for that. I wasn\u2019t worried about you disagreeing with me. In fact, it\u2019s probably better if you\u2019re on record as disagreeing with me because it will show everyone that you think for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with you for the sake of being contrary.\u201d A wrinkle appeared between Julia\u2019s delicately arched eyebrows.</p><p>Gabriel tried to kiss the wrinkle away, but without success. \u201cOf course not. Much as it may surprise you, I can be wrong, on occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Professor? Wrong? Inconceivable.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cYes, it really is surprising, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He shook his head wryly. \u201cBut by the time I finished your paper the second time, you\u2019d convinced me that the standard interpretation was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Julia couldn\u2019t believe her ears.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. Your paper changed my mind. Although I have some suggestions for how you can strengthen the last part. You didn\u2019t quite convince me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use a few pointers. I\u2019ll give you credit in the footnotes.\u201d</p><p>His hands slid to her backside. \u201cI\u2019d be honored to appear in one of your footnotes.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t think the paper is terrible? That I\u2019ll make a fool of myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Once I got over my knee-jerk reaction and paid closer attention to your argument, I realized that Professor Marinelli is right. Your paper is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Julia pressed her cheek against his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to be a student in the same field as you. I always feel as if I\u2019m trying to catch up.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s fingers tangled in her hair.</p><p>\u201cI can work harder at being more supportive. We aren\u2019t in competition. In fact, I\u2019d like to co-author an article with you, someday.\u201d</p><p>Julia lifted her head. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be good for us to create something together, out of our shared love of Dante. And I\u2019m proud of you for having the courage of your convictions. When you defend your paper at Oxford, I\u2019ll be sitting in the front row thinking, \u2018That\u2019s my girl.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true, to hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll keep saying it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The Emersons\u2019 relatives wisely refrained from commenting on how relaxed and happy they appeared when they finally exited their bedroom, just before lunch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel\u2019s brother, Scott, arrived that afternoon with his wife, Tammy, and their son, Quinn. Everyone, including Julia\u2019s father, Tom, and his girlfriend, Diane, sat down to an early dinner.</p><p>Diane Stewart was an attractive African American woman, with flawless skin, large dark eyes, and shoulder-length curls. At forty, she was almost ten years younger than her boyfriend. She\u2019d known him a long time, having lived in Selinsgrove her entire life.</p><p>As dessert was supposed to be served, Diane happened upon the Emersons dancing in the kitchen. Gabriel had wired the house with a central sound system, and the strains of soft Latin jazz filled the air.</p><p>The newlyweds were wrapped around one another, swaying softly to the music. Gabriel whispered something in Julia\u2019s ear. She seemed embarrassed and turned away, but he chuckled and pulled her close, kissing her.</p> <p>Diane backed away, intending to return to the living room, but the aging hardwood creaked beneath her feet. The Emersons stopped abruptly and turned to face her.</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>\u201cSomethin\u2019s cookin\u2019. And it ain\u2019t the apple pie.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughed, a loud and happy sound, while Julia smiled and rested her forehead against him.</p><p>Diane nodded approvingly. \u201cYou took so long to make coffee, I thought you\u2019d forgotten how.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel ran his fingers through his hair, which was mussed because of his wife\u2019s earlier explorations. \u201cDarling?\u201d He looked down at her.</p><p>\u201cThe coffee is ready and the pie is cooling. It won\u2019t take a minute.\u201d Julia reluctantly stepped away from her husband, who surreptitiously patted her backside.</p><p>At that moment, Rachel and Tammy joined them. Tammy was the newest member of the family, having married Gabriel\u2019s younger brother Scott a month previous. At five feet eleven inches, she was tall and curvaceous, with long strawberry blond hair and pale blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the holdup?\u201d Rachel looked suspiciously at her brother, as if he were the sole cause of the delay.</p><p>\u201cWe were just making coffee.\u201d Julia hid her embarrassment by pouring the beverage into a series of mugs.</p><p>\u201cI bet you were.\u201d Tammy winked slyly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was coffee they were making. Mm-hmm.\u201d Diane wagged a finger in their direction.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ll leave you ladies to it.\u201d Gabriel kissed Julia chastely before escaping to the living room.</p><p>Rachel examined the apple pies on the center island, testing their temperature with her finger. \u201cGrab a knife, Jules. Let\u2019s sample these pies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking.\u201d Diane declined Julia\u2019s offer of coffee and parked herself on one of the kitchen stools.</p><p>\u201cSo what was cooking out here? And please tell me you didn\u2019t use the counters.\u201d Rachel eyed the granite upgrades that Gabriel had insisted on purchasing.</p><p>\u201cToo cold.\u201d</p><p>Julia clapped her hand over her mouth, but it was too late.</p><p>The women burst into peals of laughter and began to tease her unmercifully.</p> <p>\u201cIs it hot in here, or is it just me?\u201d Diane fanned herself with a paper napkin. \u201cI\u2019m going to start calling this the house of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were like that.\u201d Rachel looked around the room. \u201cNot on the counters that I know of. But they were very affectionate. It must be something about the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t disagree. There was something warm and comforting about the space and the house itself. She and Gabriel had trouble keeping their hands off each other, except while she was working on her paper.</p><p>\u201cSo has my big brother made up for yesterday?\u201d Rachel looked at Julia.</p><p>She blushed a little. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I need to have a talk with him, though. He\u2019s supposed to buy flowers after a fight. Or diamonds.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked at her engagement ring, which featured a large center stone surrounded by smaller diamonds. \u201cHe\u2019s given me enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good-looking ring, honey.\u201d Diane turned to Tammy, her eyes focusing on her left hand. \u201cAnd so is yours. How\u2019s married life?\u201d</p><p>Tammy watched the halogen lights catch the facets of her engagement ring. \u201cI never thought it would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Rachel, her mouth half full.</p><p>Tammy\u2019s eyes darted toward the doorway. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we serve dessert?\u201d</p><p>Rachel swallowed. \u201cThe men have working legs. If they want pie, they can come and get it.\u201d</p><p>Tammy chuckled and picked up her coffee, cradling the mug in both hands.</p><p>\u201cBefore I started dating Scott, I lived with someone. He was my boyfriend in law school. We talked about getting married, buying a house, the whole white-picket-fence thing. Then I got pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Julia shifted uncomfortably on the bar stool, her eyes on the floor.</p><p>Tammy gave her friends a wistful look. \u201cScott told me that he was a surprise, but his parents were happy about it. I wish I\u2019d had the chance to meet Grace. She sounds like a wonderful woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cGabriel wasn\u2019t planned either. My parents took him in after his mother died and later adopted him. It isn\u2019t the planning that matters. It\u2019s what happens after.\u201d</p><p>Tammy nodded. \u201cWe\u2019d talked about having kids. We both wanted children. Then, all of a sudden, Eric decided he wasn\u2019t ready. He thought I got pregnant to trap him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you got pregnant all by yourself.\u201d Diane waved her fork in the air.</p><p>Julia said nothing, ashamed of the fact that she sympathized with Eric\u2019s lack of readiness, although she deplored his actions.</p><p>\u201cEric gave me an ultimatum\u2014the baby or him. When I hesitated, he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d muttered Rachel.</p><p>\u201cI was devastated. I knew the pregnancy wasn\u2019t my entire responsibility, but I felt like I should have been more careful. I considered an abortion, but Eric was already gone. And deep down, I was happy about being a mom.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Julia squirmed, struck by the sincerity of Tammy\u2019s tone.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford the rent on my own, so I moved back with my parents. I felt like such a failure\u2014pregnant, single, living at home. I used to cry myself to sleep thinking that no man would ever want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Julia\u2019s eyes began to water.</p><p>Tammy reached over and hugged her.</p><p>\u201cThings got better. But I\u2019ll never forgive Eric for signing away his parental rights. Now Quinn will never know his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSperm donors aren\u2019t fathers,\u201d Rachel interjected. \u201cRichard didn\u2019t contribute genetic material to Gabriel, but he\u2019s his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who contributed genetic material to Gabriel, but he must have been good looking because that boy is fine.\u201d Diane gestured toward the living room. \u201cNot as fine as my man, but then, no one is.\u201d</p><p>Julia giggled uncomfortably as she contemplated the notion that someone found her dad to be \u201cfine.\u201d</p><p>Tammy continued. \u201cI was lucky I had a job. I worked at the district attorney\u2019s office with Scott. We went out a couple of times while I was pregnant. We were just friends, but he was so sweet to me. I thought that once I had the baby, I wouldn\u2019t hear from him again. But he came to see me a few weeks after Quinn was born. He asked me out and I was smitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was smitten with you too, as I recall.\u201d Rachel grinned. \u201cHe was in deep smit.\u201d</p><p>Tammy touched her engagement ring, moving the band back and forth on her finger. \u201cI was breast-feeding the baby, so I had to pump before he picked me up. My parents babysat. But Scott never made me feel awkward or weird. He saw me as a person, a woman, instead of simply a mom. I guess he had a little crush on me when I was with Eric.\u201d She looked at her friends and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI was so nervous about meeting you all. I was worried about what you\u2019d think. But you were so welcoming.\u201d She glanced at Julia. \u201cI didn\u2019t meet Gabriel until later, but he was nice, too. Even when Quinn ruined his suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen him before he met Julia.\u201d Rachel made a face. \u201cHe would have handed Quinn the dry cleaning bill.\u201d</p><p>Julia was about to protest on Gabriel\u2019s behalf, when Tammy spoke again. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine Gabriel doing that. He\u2019s wonderful with Quinn. And Scott? Well, fatherhood does something to a man. To a good man,\u201d she clarified. \u201cScott gets down on the floor and wrestles with Quinn. He\u2019s playful and gentle. It\u2019s a whole different side to him.\u201d</p><p>Julia pondered Tammy\u2019s remarks, wondering what Gabriel would be like as a father.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to have a girl.\u201d Tammy smiled to herself. \u201cScott will treat her like a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want more kids?\u201d Rachel asked, her eyebrows lifting in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYes. I think two kids will be enough for us, but if I have another boy, I\u2019d like to try for a girl.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Scott entered the kitchen, carrying a sleepy twenty-one-month-old boy. He nodded at the other women before walking over to Tammy. \u201cI think it\u2019s bedtime.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled at the contrast between Scott, who was six foot three and strongly built, and the small blond angel he cradled protectively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d Tammy rose to her feet. She kissed her husband and they went upstairs.</p><p>Rachel looked at the stack of dessert plates and at the pies. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better take the men their dessert.\u201d She cut two slices of pie, plated them, and carried them into the living room.</p><p>Diane looked at Julia and fidgeted with her cup.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk for a minute, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Julia shifted her weight on the stool and turned to give Diane her full attention.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this, so I\u2019m just going to say it. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with your father.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave Diane an easy smile. \u201cI think that\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe met my mama and the rest of my family. He\u2019s even started coming to church with me on Sundays, to hear me sing in the choir.\u201d</p><p>Julia hid her surprise at the thought of her father in a church.</p><p>\u201cWhen Dad asked if he could bring you to my wedding, I knew things had to be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWow. Does he know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. He loves me too.\u201d Diane smiled tentatively. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about the future. Making plans . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Diane\u2019s dark eyes searched Julia\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy he\u2019s with someone who loves him. As much as I don\u2019t want to bring Deb up, I\u2019m sure you know they were together for a long time. Nothing seemed to come of it. And I really didn\u2019t like them as a couple.\u201d</p><p>Diane was quiet, as if she were mulling something over.</p><p>\u201cYour dad and I are talking about making things permanent. I want you to know that when we do that, I won\u2019t try to take the place of your mama.\u201d</p><p>Julia stiffened. \u201cSharon was not my mama.\u201d</p><p>Diane placed a comforting hand on Julia\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what Dad has told you about her, but I\u2019m guessing it isn\u2019t much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve let sleeping dogs lie. When a man\u2019s ready to talk, he\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Julia sipped her coffee in silence. She didn\u2019t enjoy talking or thinking about her mother, who died during Julia\u2019s senior year of high school. Sharon had been alcoholic and indifferent for most of Julia\u2019s life. When she wasn\u2019t indifferent, she\u2019d been abusive.</p><p>\u201cGrace was like a mother to me. I was closer to her than to Sharon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGrace was a good woman.\u201d</p><p>Julia searched Diane\u2019s expression and saw hope in her eyes, mixed with a slight anxiety.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about you becoming my stepmother. And if you and Dad get married, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do more than be there, honey. You\u2019ll be one of my bridesmaids.\u201d Diane wrapped her arms around Julia, hugging her tightly. Eventually, she pulled back, dabbing at her eyes with her fingers. \u201cI always wanted a family. I wanted a husband and a home of my own. I\u2019m forty years old and finally all my dreams are coming true. I was worried about how you\u2019d feel. I wanted you to know that I love your dad so you\u2019d know I\u2019m not with him for his money.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave her a puzzled look before both women began laughing. \u201cNow I know you\u2019re kidding. Dad doesn\u2019t have any money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man, he\u2019s got a job, and he makes me happy. A woman finds a man like that, who\u2019s fine to boot, she holds on to him and doesn\u2019t worry about the money.\u201d</p><p>Before Julia could respond, Tom joined them. When he saw Diane\u2019s wet eyes, he strode over to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d His hand went to her face, swiping the tears away with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDiane was just telling me how much she loves you.\u201d Julia offered her father an approving expression.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d His voice sounded gruff.</p><p>\u201cNot that you\u2019ve asked, but you have my blessing.\u201d</p> <p>He looked down, his dark eyes meeting his daughter\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d he repeated, his tone softening.</p><p>Tom wrapped an arm around both women before pressing a kiss to the tops of their heads.</p><p>\u201cMy girls,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>A short while later, Julia said good-bye to Diane and her father. She\u2019d thought that perhaps they were living together, at least a few nights a week, and was surprised when Diane explained that they weren\u2019t, out of respect for her mama, whom she lived with.</p><p>Now Julia began to understand why Diane was in such a hurry to get married and have a home of her own.</p><p>After dessert was served, Richard Clark sat on the back porch, drinking Scotch and smoking a cigar. The air was cool and quiet. If he closed his eyes he could almost imagine his wife, Grace, coming out the back door and settling in the Adirondack chair next to him.</p><p>Heaviness overtook his heart. She would never sit next to him again.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>Richard opened his eyes to see his daughter-in-law, Julia, sitting in the nearest chair. She\u2019d tucked her slim legs up under her and was wrapped in one of Gabriel\u2019s old cashmere cardigans.</p><p>Richard switched his cigar to his left hand and moved the ashtray so it wouldn\u2019t bother her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner was great,\u201d he offered. \u201cReally exceptional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to replicate some of the dishes we had in Italy. I\u2019m glad you liked it.\u201d She leaned her head back against the chair, staring up at the dark sky.</p><p>He tasted the Scotch again, sensing that something was troubling her. But not wishing to force a confidence, he was silent.</p><p>\u201cRichard?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI thought we\u2019d agreed that you\u2019d call me Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Dad. Sorry.\u201d She ran a fingernail down the arm of the chair, scoring the wood.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be sorry. We\u2019re family, Julia. And if you ever need anything, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She traced a finger across the wound she\u2019d given the chair. \u201cDoes it bother you that we\u2019ve changed things? Inside the house?\u201d</p><p>Richard hesitated before answering.</p><p>\u201cThe bathroom needed to be renovated, and it was smart to add another on the main floor and in the master bedroom. Grace would have liked what you did with the kitchen. She begged me for granite countertops for years.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt her heart clench.</p><p>\u201cWe kept a lot of things the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. Grace would have helped you redecorate the house gladly, if she were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you comfortable in the guest room? I was wondering if you\u2019d changed your mind about staying there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good of you to ask, but I\u2019m not bothered by any of these things. It troubles me that Grace is gone and she isn\u2019t coming back. I\u2019m afraid that feeling will never go away.\u201d</p><p>Richard focused on his wedding ring, a plain gold band.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m inside the house, sometimes, I swear I hear her voice or smell her perfume. I don\u2019t feel her when I\u2019m in Philadelphia. My condo has no memory of her.\u201d He smiled to himself. \u201cOur separation isn\u2019t so bad when I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it painful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Julia sat for a moment, as she thought about how she\u2019d feel if she lost Gabriel. She\u2019d be devastated.</p><p>The length of a human life was uncertain. One could get cancer, or die in a car accident, and in the blink of an eye a family would be torn apart.</p><p>From somewhere, Julia heard a little voice whisper, If you had a child with Gabriel, you\u2019d always have a part of him.</p><p>The voice, more than the thought behind it, made her shiver.</p><p>Noticing her reaction, Richard stood up and wrapped a blanket around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured. \u201cDo you like living in Philadelphia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy research position isn\u2019t quite what I expected. I\u2019ve been thinking about retiring.\u201d He flicked the ashes into the ashtray. \u201cI moved to be closer to Rachel and Scott, but I don\u2019t see them much. They\u2019re busy with their own lives. All my friends, including your father, are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He turned in his chair to face her.</p><p>\u201cMove back to Selinsgrove. Live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your home now, with my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only here during vacations. We can switch bedrooms immediately and you can move your things back from Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>He raised his cigar to his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of you to offer, but I made my choice. I sold the house to Gabriel over a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d be happier knowing you were where you belong.\u201d</p><p>Richard shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d never go back on my word.\u201d</p><p>Julia wracked her brain for a persuasive strategy.</p><p>\u201cIt would be a mitzvah for us. And we need the blessing.\u201d</p><p>Richard chuckled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing I used to say to Gabriel, on occasion, when he was being stubborn. What kind of blessing do you need?\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s expression shifted.</p><p>\u201cI have an unanswered prayer.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t comment further, he inhaled from his cigar and exhaled the smoke.</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion, all prayers are answered eventually. Sometimes the answer is no. But I\u2019ll certainly pray that you receive an answer. I can\u2019t pretend that the thought of moving back doesn\u2019t tempt me. But you\u2019ve put so much time into making the house yours. You\u2019ve furnished the downstairs, you\u2019ve painted walls . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mortgaged this house to pay Gabriel\u2019s drug debts.\u201d</p><p>Richard looked at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHe told you about that, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago. Gabriel paid us back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason for him to open his home to you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA father would do anything for his child.\u201d Richard\u2019s expression was grave. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about the money. I was trying to save his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. You and Grace.\u201d Julia looked around the yard. \u201cAs long as the house is in the family and we can be together for Thanksgiving and Christmas, it doesn\u2019t matter who owns it. Or who lives here.\u201d</p><p>She tightened the blanket around her as a whisper of a breeze blew across the porch, caressing her face. \u201cGabriel would never part with the orchard, though. He\u2019s hired people to revitalize it. They\u2019ve planted trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old trees haven\u2019t yielded a good crop in years. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s a bit optimistic.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked toward the woods, in the direction of the orchard. \u201cOptimism is good for him.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Richard.</p><p>\u201cIf you lived here, you could supervise the orchard. It would relieve Gabriel to know it\u2019s in capable hands. You\u2019d be helping us out.\u201d</p><p>Richard was quiet for what seemed like an age. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand before leaving him to his cigar and his thoughts. As he closed his eyes, a feeling of hope washed over him.</p><p>After her guests retired for the evening, Julia sat on the edge of her whirlpool tub testing the temperature of the water. She was looking forward to a few moments of relaxation.</p><p>She knew she should be working on her lecture, but the tumult of the day had left her weary. She wondered if she should call her therapist back in Boston. Surely Dr. Walters would have suggestions about how to deal with anxiety, marital conflict, and Gabriel\u2019s renewed interest in starting a family.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a terrible thing to want a baby. Julia contrasted Gabriel\u2019s tender enthusiasm with the cold indifference Tammy described in Eric. Of course, Julia knew which she preferred. She just needed to stand her ground and not let Gabriel\u2019s passion overwhelm her and her dreams.</p><p>If anything, her conflict with Gabriel the day before illustrated how much they had to learn as a couple. They needed to learn those lessons before bringing a child into the world.</p><p>As she waited for the water level to rise, she felt the hairs of her neck stand on end. She turned to find Gabriel standing by the vanity. He\u2019d unbuttoned the top three buttons of his dress shirt; a few strands of chest hair were now visible over the band of his white undershirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never tire of looking at you.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her neck before removing the plush towel she\u2019d wrapped around herself.</p><p>\u201cI should paint you.\u201d He stroked her spine with his fingertips, up and down.</p><p>\u201cYou painted me the other night, Caravaggio. We got paint all over the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. It pained me to have to clean it up. I was hoping we could add to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will have to wait for a night when we don\u2019t have guests.\u201d She gave him a saucy look. \u201cCare to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be sure to put on a show.\u201d She lifted her hair from her neck with both hands, arching her back into the pose of a pinup girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He groaned and took a step forward.</p><p>She held out her hand, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cI left my bubble bath in the guest bathroom last night. Would you mind getting it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Goddess.\u201d He tasted her lips before walking away.</p> <p>It took him a few minutes to locate the bubble bath, because someone had knocked it to the floor and it had rolled next to the wastepaper basket. When he stooped to pick it up, he noticed something wedged in between the basket and the wall.</p><p>It was a small, rectangular box.</p><p>He read the label. Pregnancy test.</p><p>But the box was empty.</p><p>When he\u2019d overcome his surprise, and double-checked that he\u2019d read the label correctly, he placed the box where he\u2019d found it and returned to his room.</p> <p>Wordlessly, he handed the bubble bath to Julia, who proceeded to lace the water with its sandalwood-and-satsuma-scented essence before climbing into the tub.</p><p>She arranged herself in what she thought would be a provocative pose.</p><p>Lost in thought, Gabriel stood motionless.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d She angled herself in the bathtub so she could see him better.</p><p>He passed a hand over his mouth and chin.</p><p>\u201cIs Rachel pregnant?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot that I know of. She told me they were trying. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found an empty box for a pregnancy test in the guest bathroom. It looked like someone tried to hide it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was probably her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it were you.\u201d Gabriel gave her a look that was so intense, she felt its heat on her skin.</p><p>\u201cEven after what happened yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Couples argue. Husbands are asses. We have hot, sweaty makeup sex and move on.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the water. \u201cI\u2019d rather have the hot, sweaty makeup sex without the fighting.\u201d</p><p>His voice dropped to a husky whisper. \u201cThat would rather defeat the purpose of making up, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>She inhaled deeply and lifted her dark eyes to meet his. \u201cI\u2019m not ready for a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur time will come.\u201d He took her hand, pressing his lips to her soapy fingers. \u201cAnd believe me, I don\u2019t want to start another argument tonight or add to your stress.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled weakly.</p><p>\u201cI suppose the test could be Tammy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already has a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn will be two in September. I know she wants children with Scott.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel adjusted the lighting, dimming it before disappearing into the bedroom. A moment later, he returned, and Julia heard the voice of Astrud Gilberto floating from the speaker that was mounted in the ceiling.</p><p>Julia gave her husband an appreciative look. \u201cWhoever took the test might have discovered she isn\u2019t pregnant. But if she is, you\u2019ll be an uncle again. Uncle Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Without reacting, he unbuttoned his shirt. He pulled it off and removed his T-shirt, exposing his tattoo and the light dusting of dark hair on his muscled chest.</p><p>Julia watched as he hung his shirt on a hook before his hands went to his belt. He smirked as he slowed his movements, teasing her.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cThe bathwater will be cold by the time you finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. I certainly won\u2019t be standing out here when I finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I intend to finish inside you.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk, he hung up his trousers before divesting himself of his boxers.</p><p>Julia knew her husband\u2019s body well, but even so, his figure always took her breath away. He had wide shoulders that tapered to a narrow waist and hips, which framed muscular thighs. His arms, along with his abdominals, were well defined, as was the V that sloped to his all-too-prominent sex.</p><p>\u201cIt kills me when you look at me like that.\u201d His eyes fixed hers hungrily.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She stared at him shamelessly, moving forward in the bathtub to make room for him.</p><p>\u201cBecause you look as if you want to lick me. All over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, Gabriel settled behind her, wrapping his long legs around hers. \u201cThat scent is familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought the bubble bath because it reminded me of the massage oil you used in Florence. You rubbed my back, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, I rubbed more than that.\u201d Gabriel nuzzled her ear with his nose. \u201cYou have no idea what that scent does to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I do.\u201d Julia rested against his chest, feeling him hard against her lower back.</p><p>\u201cBefore we move on to\u2014ah\u2014other activities, I\u2019d like you to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Julia tensed.</p><p>He placed his hands on either side of her neck and began to massage her.</p><p>\u201cRelax. I\u2019m not the enemy. I\u2019m simply trying to persuade you to confide in me a little. You tend to take bubble baths when you\u2019re stressed. And you\u2019ve been taking them daily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just have a lot on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She used her left hand to skim the surface of the water, pushing the suds back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI worry about grad school and flunking out. I worry about my lecture.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken about your lecture and I gave you my honest opinion\u2014 it\u2019s good. You aren\u2019t going to flunk out of your program. You just have to take grad school one semester at a time. You don\u2019t have to entertain our relatives this week. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll announce that you\u2019re spending the day working on your paper. They\u2019ll entertain themselves during the day, and tomorrow night I\u2019ll grill steaks for dinner. I\u2019m sure Rachel and Tammy will pitch in.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s muscles began to soften under his fingers. \u201cThat would help. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything for you,\u201d he whispered, pressing his lips against her neck. \u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She turned and kissed him earnestly.</p><p>When they broke apart, she smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll have your birthday when we\u2019re in Italy. How would you like to celebrate it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you. In bed. For a couple of days.\u201d He spread his arms around her waist, stroking the skin around her navel.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to invite people to join us in Umbria? They could come with us to the exhibition in Florence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you all to myself. We can invite them to Cambridge for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>Julia placed her hand over his, stopping his movements. \u201cI don\u2019t like making a big deal about my birthday.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back. \u201cI thought we were past that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be busy in September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five is a milestone birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is thirty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy milestones are only important because of you. Without you, they\u2019d be empty days.\u201d</p><p>Julia buried her face in his chest. \u201cDo you have to be so sweet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve eaten sour for most of my life, yes.\u201d With his mouth, he explored the curve of her neck and the soap-slicked skin of her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess we\u2019re having a party in September. We should celebrate Labor Day weekend.\u201d She kissed his pectorals before facing forward once again. \u201cWhat did Richard say when you spoke to him tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d like to move back, but he doesn\u2019t want to buy the house. I think he was counting on the money for his retirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can live here without buying it. You don\u2019t care, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019d rather he lived here. But he feels badly about taking advantage of the renovations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow he can enjoy them. The only problem is what to do with the furniture. There\u2019s no room for it back in Cambridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could give it to Tom. His furnishings have seen better days.\u201d The Professor sounded prim.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, Julianne. Your father is not my favorite person. But since you are . . .\u201d He kissed her.</p><p>\u201cRichard has things he bought with Grace that he doesn\u2019t want to part with, and there\u2019s some of the furniture he left behind that we put into storage. We\u2019ll have to move the new furniture out to make room. We could offer it to Rachel, if you\u2019d rather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be nice to offer it to my dad. He and Diane are talking about getting married.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tightened his arm around her middle. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good to my dad and she\u2019s good to me. I\u2019d like him to have someone to grow old with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to break it to you, darling, but your father is already growing old. We all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He moved her so she was facing him, bringing her legs around his waist.</p><p>\u201cLucky for you, I\u2019m not too old to keep you up all night. I believe this is a room we haven\u2019t christened\u2014yet.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Sometime after midnight, Richard felt the mattress dip as someone crawled under the blankets. He rolled over, spooning the body of his wife. Her figure was familiar and soft, and he sighed loudly as he pressed against her.</p><p>She sighed equally in contentment, as she always had in such moments, nestling into him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d He stroked her hair, kissing it. It didn\u2019t seem strange to him that her hair was long and straight, the way it had been before chemotherapy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too, darling.\u201d Grace reached for his hand and wound their fingers together.</p><p>Richard felt her wedding and engagement rings tap against his wedding band. He was glad he hadn\u2019t removed it.</p><p>\u201cI dream about you.\u201d</p><p>She kissed where their rings touched. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were so young. We had our lives ahead of us, so many things we wanted to do.\u201d His voice caught on the last word.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss this,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHolding you in the dark. Hearing your voice. I can\u2019t believe I lost you.\u201d</p><p>Grace freed his left hand and pulled it toward her chest.</p><p>Richard steeled himself for the feel of the concave impressions where her breasts had been. Although he was sorrowful over her scars, it never bothered him to look at or touch her there. But she wouldn\u2019t permit it.</p><p>She\u2019d been planning on having reconstructive surgery, but the cancer returned, making surgery impossible. She was always beautiful to him, always enchanting, even at the end.</p><p>As she brought his hand up, his palm met round, full flesh. He hesitated, but only for a moment. She placed her hand over his and pressed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been healed,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt was more wonderful than you can imagine. And it didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s eyes pricked. \u201cHealed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pain. No tears. And it\u2019s so, so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize you were sick.\u201d His voice caught again. \u201cI should have paid attention. I should have noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my time.\u201d She reached down and kissed the back of his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s so much I want to show you. But not yet. Rest, my love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The next morning, Richard awoke to an empty bed and the knowledge that he\u2019d been given a very precious gift. He felt lighter, more at peace than he had been in a long time. He breakfasted with his family and began making arrangements to resign from his research position in Philadelphia.</p><p>In the next week, he put his condo up for sale and hired movers to return his things to the house he\u2019d bought with his wife so many years ago. Gabriel insisted that the items they\u2019d placed in storage also be returned to the house.</p><p>When the moving trucks arrived, he directed the movers to the master bedroom, asking them to remove its furniture before bringing in Richard\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Richard placed his hand on his son\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe guest room is mine now.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel indicated to the movers that they should give him a minute. He turned to his father, eyebrows knitted together.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want your old room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master bedroom is yours now, with Julia. She\u2019s painted it and made it her own. I won\u2019t undo that.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel protested, but Richard lifted his hand to stop him.</p><p>\u201cGrace will be with me wherever I sleep. She\u2019ll find me in the guest room.\u201d He clapped his hand on Gabriel\u2019s shoulder once again before calling to the movers and directing them upstairs.</p> <p>Gabriel wasn\u2019t about to argue with his father, especially when he seemed content with his decision. And if he found his father\u2019s remarks strange, he kept that to himself.</p><p>(But in truth, he didn\u2019t find the remarks strange.)</p><p>That night, when the house was empty and quiet, Richard could almost imagine Grace getting into bed with him. He rolled onto his side and slept peacefully before meeting her in his dreams.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>July 2011</p><p>Oxford, England</p> <p>Professor Gabriel O. Emerson peered contemptuously around the modest guest room in staircase five of the Cloisters of Magdalen College. His blue eyes alighted on a pair of twin beds that were situated along the wall, and he pointed at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are those?\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes followed the path of his accusatory finger. \u201cI think those are beds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>He picked up their bags and approached the door, but she stopped him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, Gabriel. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Where the hell are we supposed to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do Magdalen students usually sleep? On the floor?\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a withering look. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping in a ridiculous abomination of a single bed ever again. We\u2019re checking into the Randolph.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her eyes with both hands. \u201cOur reservation isn\u2019t until two days from now. And besides, you promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNigel promised me one of the unused don\u2019s rooms, a room with a double bed and an en-suite.\u201d He looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s the double bed? Where\u2019s the en-suite? We\u2019ll have to share the bathroom with God knows who else!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind sharing a bathroom with the other guest room for two nights. We\u2019ll be at the conference most of the time.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her husband\u2019s irate sputtering, Julia walked to the window, which overlooked the beautiful quadrangle below. She stared longingly at the strange stone figures that were set above the archways to the right.</p><p>\u201cYou told me that C.S. Lewis was inspired by those statues when he wrote The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they say,\u201d Gabriel said in a clipped voice.</p><p>She rested her forehead against the leaded glass. \u201cDo you think his ghost ever wanders around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019d haunt a room like this.\u201d Gabriel sniffed. \u201cHe\u2019s probably at the pub.\u201d</p><p>Julia closed her eyes. It had been a long day, traveling from the hotel in London to the railway station, then to Oxford, and now here. She was so very, very tired.</p><p>He took in her subdued form from across the room.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as ghosts, Julianne. You know that.\u201d His voice was gentle.</p><p>\u201cWhat about when you saw Grace and Maia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the statues wistfully before joining him at the door, wearing a defeated expression.</p><p>\u201cWould it make you unhappy to stay at the hotel?\u201d His eyes searched hers. \u201cWe\u2019d have greater privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would, yes.\u201d She looked away.</p><p>He glanced at the twin beds. \u201cSex is almost impossible in those things. There isn\u2019t enough room.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cThat isn\u2019t how I remember it.\u201d</p><p>A slow, provocative smile spread across his face, and he brought his lips within inches of hers.</p><p>\u201cIs that a challenge, Mrs. Emerson?\u201d</p><p>Julia regarded him for a moment. Then she seemed to shrug off her fatigue as she wrapped his silk tie around her hand, pulling his mouth to hers.</p><p>Gabriel dropped their luggage and kissed her, forgetting his irritation. Then he reached back with his foot and kicked the door shut behind them.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Some time later, Gabriel was entwined with his wife in one of the narrow beds. She breathed his name against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lost your skill. I found your most recent innovation extremely\u2014satisfying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His chest swelled. \u201cIt\u2019s late now. Time for sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel coaxed her chin upward. \u201cAre you worried about your paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make you proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will always be proud of you. I am proud of you.\u201d His blue eyes lasered into hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Professor Picton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t invite you if she thought you weren\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if someone asks me a question and I don\u2019t know the answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou answer it as best you can. If they press you, you can always say they\u2019ve asked a good question and you\u2019ll give the matter some thought.\u201d</p><p>Julia rested against his chest, her fingers scaling his abdominal muscles.</p><p>\u201cDo you think if I asked C.S. Lewis to intercede on my behalf, he\u2019d pray for me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel snorted.</p><p>\u201cLewis was a Protestant from Northern Ireland. He didn\u2019t believe in petitioning the saints. Even if he heard you, he\u2019d ignore you. On principle.</p><p>\u201cAsk Tolkien. He was Catholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask Dante to pray for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante is already praying for you.\u201d He spoke against her hair.</p><p>Julia closed her eyes, listening to the sound of his heartbeat. She always found its rhythm comforting.</p><p>\u201cWhat if people ask why you left Toronto?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll say what we always say\u2014I wanted to be in Boston because you were going to Harvard and we were getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrista Peterson has been telling a different story.\u201d</p><p>The Professor\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cForget about her. We don\u2019t need to worry about her at this conference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t lose your temper if you hear something\u2014unsavory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a little credit.\u201d He sounded exasperated. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to deal with gossip at BU and Harvard and I haven\u2019t lost my temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She kissed his chest. \u201cBut academics get bored and like to talk. Nothing is more exciting than a sex scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s eyes twinkled.</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex with you is more exciting than a scandal.\u201d</p><p>He flipped her to her back and proceeded to kiss her neck.</p><p>Before the sun peeked over the horizon, Julia crept back into the room. A shaft of light from the window partially illuminated the naked man in her bed. He was lying on his stomach, his dark hair mussed. The sheet was slung dangerously low, exposing his lower back, his dimples, and the top of his backside.</p><p>Julia gazed at him appreciatively, her eyes resting a beat longer than necessary on his muscular back and gluteus maximus. He was beautiful, he was sexy, and he was hers.</p><p>She removed her yoga pants and T-shirt, placing her clothes and underthings on an obliging chair. Since they\u2019d been married, she almost always slept naked. She preferred it that way\u2014to sleep skin against skin with her beloved.</p><p>Gabriel stirred when he felt the mattress move. He accepted her into his arms immediately, but it took a few moments for him to awake.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d He began to run his fingers up and down her arm.</p><p>\u201cI went to see the stone figures in the quadrangle.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes opened. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read the Narnia books. They were special to me.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face.</p><p>\u201cSo you wanted to stay here because of Lewis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd because of you. I know that Paulina lived here when you did, and I . . .\u201d She stopped, regretting the fact that she\u2019d mentioned someone they were both trying to forget.</p><p>\u201cThat was before we were involved. I spent very little time with her here.\u201d He wrapped Julia in his arms. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have tried to take you to the Randolph tonight, if I\u2019d known your reasons. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d think my attachment to the Narnia books was juvenile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything important to you can\u2019t be juvenile.\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment as he considered what she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cI read those books, too. There was a closet in my mother\u2019s apartment back in New York that I was convinced would open into Narnia if I was a good boy. Clearly, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to laugh, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be willing to do anything to make the stories real,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s hold on her tightened. \u201cIf you want to see where Lewis lived, I\u2019ll take you to The Kilns, his house. Then we\u2019ll go to The Bird and Baby, where the Inklings met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a kiss against her hair. \u201cI said once that you were not my equal, but my better. I\u2019m afraid you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to believe that you think that, sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He winced.</p><p>\u201cI need to do a better job of showing you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure how.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>After breakfast in Magdalen\u2019s dining room, Gabriel insisted that they take a taxi to St. Anne\u2019s, the venue for the conference. He was worried that Julia (and her high heels) wouldn\u2019t survive the walk, and there was no way in hell he was asking her to change shoes.</p><p>\u201cThis is a dream come true,\u201d Julia murmured, as they drove through Oxford. \u201cI never imagined being able to visit here, let alone being able to present my research. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked very hard.\u201d He brought her hand to his lips. \u201cThis is your reward.\u201d</p><p>Julia was silent, as she felt the weight of expectations on her shoulders.</p><p>When they passed the Ashmolean Museum, Gabriel\u2019s eyes suddenly grew alight.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what kind of trouble we can get into in there.\u201d He pointed to the museum. \u201cAs I recall, there are ample locations for a tryst or two.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia blushed and he pulled her into his side, chuckling.</p><p>He still had the ability to make her blush, a feat in which he took no little pride. And he\u2019d done more than make her blush a few days previous when they\u2019d tangoed against a wall in the British Museum.</p><p>(The Elgin Marbles had yet to recover from their shock.)</p><p>The Emersons arrived at St. Anne\u2019s College just prior to the beginning of the first session. Inside, a group of fifty academics were milling about the refreshment tables, sipping tea and enjoying cookies while chatting about the extraordinary world of Dante studies.</p> <p>(For indeed, that world was much more interesting than it appeared to outsiders.)</p><p>Gabriel poured Julia some tea before helping himself to coffee. He introduced her to two prominent Oxford professors of his acquaintance as they sipped their drinks.</p><p>When it was time to enter the lecture theater, Gabriel placed his hand at the small of Julia\u2019s back, urging her forward. She took two steps before she stopped.</p><p>A familiar and careless laugh filled her ears, the source of the laughter visible a few feet away. In the center of a group of old and young men dressed primarily in tweed was a raven-haired beauty, holding court. She was tall and lithe, her attractive form clad in a fitted black jacket and skirt. Four-inch heels made her long legs even longer.</p><p>(For once in his life, the Professor regarded a pair of elegant designer shoes with something other than appreciation.)</p> <p>The woman\u2019s laugh was curtailed when a man with black hair and very tanned skin began whispering something in her ear, his eyes focusing on the Emersons.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d said Gabriel, under his breath.</p><p>He offered Christa Peterson and Professor Giuseppe Pacciani a thunderous look, while Julia catalogued the reactions of the men who stood nearby. As her eyes drifted from one to the next, a terrible and sinking feeling washed over her.</p><p>More than one man stared back at her, their eyes resting longer than was appropriate on her breasts and hips. She released Gabriel\u2019s hand and buttoned up her suit jacket so that it covered more of her chest.</p><p>A look of visible disappointment marked several of the men\u2019s appraisals. Clearly Julia didn\u2019t live up to their expectations of a young and delectable graduate student, a woman who\u2019d slept with her professor and become enmeshed in a scandal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m settling this once and for all.\u201d Gabriel surged forward, but Julia dug her fingers into his arm, pressing into the wool of his suit as well as his flesh.</p> <p>\u201cCan I talk to you for a minute?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAfter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Julia hissed. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble in Paradise?\u201d Christa\u2019s smug voice reverberated in the room. \u201cI guess the honeymoon didn\u2019t last very long.\u201d</p><p>She fixed her eyes, catlike, on Julia, her attractive mouth curling into a sneer. \u201cNot that I\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>Julia tried to pull Gabriel away, but he stood his ground, his body vibrating with anger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a word, Miss Peterson.\u201d</p><p>Christa inched closer to Professor Pacciani. She made a show of appearing to be intimidated by Gabriel.</p> <p>\u201cNot after what happened in Toronto. If you have something to say you\u2019ll have to say it in front of witnesses.\u201d</p><p>From the safety of Pacciani\u2019s side, she leaned forward, dropping her voice. \u201cIt isn\u2019t in your interest to make a scene, Gabriel. I found out a few things after you resigned, such as your involvement in BDSM. I didn\u2019t know that Professor Ann Singer was your Domme.\u201d</p><p>A hush fell over those closest to the antagonists, their eyes shifting from Christa to Gabriel.</p><p>Julia took his hand in hers and tugged. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Please.\u201d</p><p>Despite Gabriel\u2019s fury he was conscious, all too conscious, of the now rapt attention of his peers. Still, it took every ounce of his self-control not to lunge forward and seize Christa by the throat.</p><p>Stifling a curse, he turned abruptly and took a single step away from his former student.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to your paper, Julianne.\u201d Christa lifted her voice so more people could hear. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual for a first-year student to be included in such an important conference. However did you manage it?\u201d</p><p>Julia paused, looking at Christa over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Picton invited me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Christa appeared puzzled. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been better to invite Gabriel to speak? I mean, you\u2019re probably repeating things you learned from him. Or maybe he simply wrote your paper for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do my own research.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice was quiet but steely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d Christa made a point of glancing at Gabriel\u2019s back. \u201cBut your \u2018research\u2019 can\u2019t help you write a lecture. Unless you\u2019re planning to tell us about all the professors you slept with in order to get into Harvard.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel swore and released Julia\u2019s hand. He turned around, casting furious eyes in Christa\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. You don\u2019t speak to my wife. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemper, temper, Gabriel.\u201d Christa\u2019s dark eyes shone with perverse amusement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Professor Emerson,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Julia blocked his path with her body.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She placed a light hand on his chest, just under his bow tie.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way.\u201d He looked like a dragon preparing to breathe fire.</p><p>\u201cFor me,\u201d she begged, her expression pleading.</p><p>Before Gabriel could open his mouth, an authoritative voice sounded at his elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>Katherine Picton stood to his right, her white hair short and impeccably styled, her gray-blue eyes flashing behind her glasses. She eyed Professor Pacciani with distaste before turning her attention to Christa.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Christa\u2019s posture shifted from defensive to ingratiating. She extended her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Christa Peterson, from Columbia. We met at the University of Toronto.\u201d</p><p>Katherine ignored the proffered hand. \u201cI\u2019m familiar with the faculty at Columbia. You aren\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>Christa reddened, withdrawing her hand. \u201cI\u2019m a graduate student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t present yourself as anything else,\u201d Katherine snapped. \u201cYou aren\u2019t from Columbia. You attend Columbia. I repeat, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>When Christa didn\u2019t respond, Professor Picton stepped closer, raising her voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you hard of hearing? I asked you a question. What are you doing at my conference, insulting my guests?\u201d</p><p>Christa almost faltered, feeling the energy in the room shift under Professor Picton\u2019s antipathy. Even Professor Pacciani took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to attend your lecture, like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>Katherine straightened to her full five feet and looked up at the much taller and half-century younger graduate student.</p><p>\u201cYour name isn\u2019t on the guest list. I certainly didn\u2019t invite you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Picton, excuse me. The young lady is a friend.\u201d Professor Pacciani smoothly interceded. He bowed and moved to kiss Professor Picton\u2019s hand, but she waved at him dismissively.</p><p>\u201cAs a companion of yours, Giuseppe, her attendance might be excusable. But barely.\u201d She glared at him. \u201cYou need to teach her some manners.\u201d</p><p>Katherine turned to address Christa directly.</p><p>\u201cI know the havoc you wreaked in Toronto. Your lies almost destroyed my department. You\u2019ll follow the rules of decorum here, or I\u2019ll have you removed. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for a response, Katherine began scolding Pacciani in fluid Italian, pointing out in no uncertain terms that if his friend made her guests\u2019 visit unpleasant in any way, she would hold him personally responsible.</p><p>She added that she had a perfect and unforgiving memory.</p><p>(It should be mentioned that she was correct.)</p><p>\u201cCapisce?\u201d She glared at him through her glasses.</p><p>\u201cCerto, Professor.\u201d He bowed, his face drawn and angry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the injured party,\u201d Christa protested. \u201cWhen I was in Toronto, Gabriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCodswallop,\u201d Katherine spat. \u201cI\u2019m old, not senile. I recognize a woman scorned when I see one. And so should everyone else.\u201d At this, Katherine directed her scathing expression to the men who had surrounded Christa, eager to give ear to her gossip.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more, inviting yourself to an invitation-only event is unprofessional in the extreme. This isn\u2019t a fraternity party.\u201d</p><p>Professor Picton looked around the room once more, pausing as if to challenge anyone to contradict her. Under her withering stare, the prurient onlookers began shuffling their feet and backing away.</p><p>Seemingly satisfied, she turned her attention back to Miss Peterson and lifted her chin. \u201cI believe I\u2019m quite finished.\u201d</p><p>With that, she favored Christa with her back. The other occupants of the room stood by, somewhat shell-shocked by just having witnessed the academic equivalent of a mud-wrestling match, handily won by a small (but feisty) septuagenarian.</p><p>\u201cMy dear friends, it\u2019s good to see you. How was your flight?\u201d Katherine placed her arm around Julia\u2019s stiff shoulders, giving her a fraternal squeeze, before shaking Gabriel\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThe flight was fine. We spent a few days in London before arriving by train.\u201d Gabriel kissed Professor Picton\u2019s cheek. He tried to force a smile but failed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not impressed with the fact that they\u2019ve admitted riffraff.\u201d Katherine sniffed. \u201cI must speak to the conference organizers. It\u2019s bad enough that you young people should be subjected to such a person, but to have to endure her in public. What a ridiculous girl.\u201d</p><p>Professor Picton\u2019s aged eyes quickly took in Julia\u2019s expression of distress, and her demeanor softened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a drink this evening, Julianne. I think it\u2019s time for us to have a little chat.\u201d</p><p>The professor\u2019s words jarred Julia out of her quietude. A thinly veiled expression of terror flashed across her features.</p><p>Gabriel grasped her around the waist. \u201cThat\u2019s very generous, Katherine, but why don\u2019t you join us for dinner, instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I\u2019d enjoy that. But I\u2019ll speak to Julianne first.\u201d She turned to her former student, her expression kind. \u201cCome and find me after the last lecture and we\u2019ll walk to The Bird and Baby.\u201d</p><p>Professor Picton took her leave and was immediately surrounded by several academic admirers.</p><p>It took a moment for Julia to regain her composure, but when she did, she leaned against Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Katherine interrupted when she did. I would have liked to say a few words.\u201d</p><p>Julia began wringing her hands. \u201cI never should have answered Christa. We should have walked away.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression tightened. He looked around, then brought his mouth close to her ear. \u201cYou stood up for yourself, which was the right thing to do. And I\u2019m not going to stand there and let her call you a whore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019d walked away, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. She\u2019s already slandering us. You said so yourself.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s face was marked by disappointment. \u201cI asked you to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I explained that I wasn\u2019t about to let her speak to you that way.\u201d He clenched his jaw and released it. \u201cLet\u2019s not fight because of that bitch. That\u2019s precisely what she wants.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was spoiling for a fight. And you gave it to her.\u201d Julia glanced around the rapidly emptying room. \u201cTomorrow I have to stand up in front of everyone, knowing that they witnessed that embarrassing scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d said nothing, if I\u2019d done nothing, then it would look like I agreed with her.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice rumbled, low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cI asked you to stop, and you brushed me off.\u201d She gave him a wounded look. \u201cI\u2019m your wife. Not a speed bump.\u201d</p><p>She clutched her old Fendi messenger bag and followed the crowd into the lecture theater.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>Professor Emerson seethed with anger as he watched his wife walk away. He wanted to drag Christa Peterson outside by her hair and teach her a lesson. Unfortunately, based on her seductive behavior when she was his student, she\u2019d probably enjoy it.</p><p>(And take photographs for her scrapbook.)</p><p>It was not like him to want to strike a woman.</p><p>Or perhaps it was. Perhaps it was precisely like him to want to strike a woman. Anger and violence were written in the bone, the product of DNA. Perhaps Gabriel was just like his father.</p><p>He closed his eyes. As quickly as the thought emerged, he tamped it down. Now was not the time to think of what he did and did not know about his biological parents.</p><p>Gabriel knew he had a temper. He tried to control it but frequently failed. On one such occasion, to his shame, he\u2019d struck a woman.</p> <p>He was teaching in Toronto. The women were beautiful and sexy; the city was ripe with diversions of music and art. Yet he\u2019d been depressed. Paulina had been to see him and they\u2019d resumed their sexual relationship\u2014again. After every encounter, he\u2019d swear it would be the last time. But every time she put her hands on him, he gave in.</p><p>He knew it was wrong. His continued involvement with her was damaging to both of them. But his spirit, although willing, was tied to flesh that was very, very weak.</p><p>After she went back to Boston, he began drinking heavily. He became a VIP at Lobby and fucked a different woman every night. Sometimes fucking more than one in a single Scotch-soaked evening. Sometimes fucking more than one at the same time.</p><p>Nothing helped. Haunted by his past, made all the more recent by his few days with Paulina, he felt as if he were one careless moment away from resuming his cocaine habit.</p><p>Then he met Ann. They shared an enthusiasm for fencing and fenced a few times at their club, only to retire to a darkened room on the last occasion for a brief but explosive sexual encounter.</p><p>Ann Singer promised new, tantalizing diversions. She whispered words of raw, intense pleasure the likes of which he\u2019d never experienced.</p><p>He was intrigued. She had the power to drag his mind into his body and keep it there, unable to think or worry. And that was how he found himself in the basement of her town house in Toronto, naked, restrained, and on his knees.</p><p>She confused his senses by both pleasing and punishing him. With every strike, all his emotional pain seemed to bleed away. His single errant thought was why had he waited so long to use physical pain to alleviate his mental suffering. But even that thought was soon forgotten.</p> <p>Then came the humiliation. Ann\u2019s dominance was over the mind, as well as the body. As she bruised his flesh, she sought to break his will.</p><p>Gabriel realized what she was doing, and his psyche bristled. He desired physical pain and accepted it, but not psychological manipulation. His mind was fucked up enough thanks to his past.</p><p>He began to resist.</p><p>She accused him of attempting to top from the bottom and redoubled her efforts. She retold his life story, spinning a speculative myth based solely on her own armchair analysis. Some of it came perilously close to the truth. And the rest of it . . .</p><p>Without warning, something inside him snapped.</p><p>Standing in St. Anne\u2019s College, Gabriel couldn\u2019t recall exactly what Professor Singer said that set him off. He couldn\u2019t remember how long the encounter lasted. He only remembered white-hot, blinding fury.</p><p>In one swift motion, he broke the restraint on his right wrist (a considerable feat) and backhanded her across the face. Her diminutive form crumpled to the tiled floor.</p><p>He stumbled to his feet and stood over her, breathing heavily. She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>A door flew open and Gabriel found himself boxing one-handed with her bodyguard, who\u2019d rushed to her defense. Bruised and bloodied, Gabriel was flung outside into the snow, his clothes scattered behind him.</p><p>That was his last sexual encounter with Ann and his final experience with BDSM. He was revolted by the fact that he\u2019d lost control and hit her, and he was determined never to strike a woman again. Even now, the shame washed over him.</p><p>Gabriel closed his eyes and tried to compose himself. He\u2019d never explained the entirety of what happened with Professor Singer to Julianne. He wasn\u2019t about to do so now. Some things were better left unsaid.</p><p>He mentally catalogued the eminent Dante specialists who\u2019d overheard Christa\u2019s remarks about his past. It was embarrassing, to be sure. But he was tenured and full professor. They could go to hell.</p><p>(And study Dante\u2019s Inferno in person.)</p><p>But he needed to neutralize Christa before she damaged Julianne\u2019s reputation any further. She\u2019d all but called Julia a whore, suggesting her academic success was won on her knees.</p><p>With that thought twisting in his mind, he straightened his bow tie, smoothed his suit jacket, and entered the lecture theater.</p><p>Julia watched as her husband approached, his eyes averted, his visage grim.</p><p>He glowered at Christa, who sat with Professor Pacciani, before taking the seat between Julia and Professor Picton. Gabriel didn\u2019t speak as he pulled his Meisterst\u00fcck 149 fountain pen and a notepad out of his leather briefcase. His body language was decidedly cross.</p><p>Julia tried to concentrate on the lecture, which was on the use of the number three in Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. The subject matter and delivery of the presentation could only be described as contravening the Geneva Conventions on cruel and unusual punishment. Worse still was being next to Gabriel and feeling his anger radiating through his handsome three-piece suit.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw that he was taking copious notes, his elegant script uncharacteristically forceful and angular. There was tension around his mouth and a familiar crease between his dark brows, behind his glasses.</p><p>Julia was disappointed in him, but she wasn\u2019t angry. She knew it was consonant with his character to be the avenging angel. There had been times when she welcomed that aspect of his personality, such as when he\u2019d beaten Simon senseless after he\u2019d attacked her.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t like fighting with him, especially in public. She certainly didn\u2019t enjoy the sight of him losing his temper and causing a scene in front of so many important people, even if Katherine defended him.</p><p>She sighed quietly. His love for her and his desire that she succeed likely fueled his anger.</p><p>You\u2019re his first serious and committed relationship. You should cut the guy some slack.</p><p>She wanted to touch him but was wary of how she might be received. Certainly, she didn\u2019t wish to interrupt him. She imagined him peering at her over the rims of his glasses, his expression censorious. Such a reaction would cut her deeply.</p><p>It had been a long time since she\u2019d seen him truly angry. Julia thought back to their explosive interactions in his Dante seminar, when she\u2019d challenged him about Paulina. He\u2019d been furious until his anger shifted to passion.</p><p>She uncrossed and crossed her legs. Now was not the time to think about passion. She\u2019d wait until they were back in their room at Magdalen before she reached out to him. Otherwise, he might decide to make up with her and drag her into a corner for conference sex.</p><p>(Conference sex was a peculiar compunction of certain academics. It should be avoided at all costs.)</p><p>The next lecture was as torturous as the first. Julia feigned interest while her thoughts fixated on one point. If Gabriel had listened to her, Christa would have been forced to spin her web of slander without a large, focused audience. Now Julia would have to mingle with the other attendees knowing they\u2019d witnessed the embarrassing display. She was shy to begin with. Christa had magnified her unease a hundredfold.</p><p>Despite their falling out, Julia would have preferred to spend the day at his side, especially during lunch and the frequent tea and coffee breaks. But they\u2019d agreed the night before to circulate among the conferencegoers, giving Julia the opportunity to network.</p><p>She forced herself to make small talk, allowing Professors Marinelli and Picton to introduce her to their old friends, while Gabriel mingled on the other side of the room. He was obviously on a charm offensive\u2014trying to speak to as many conferencegoers as possible. From the glances Julia received, it was clear he was speaking about her.</p><p>Women flocked to him. No matter where he was, there were always one or two women standing near him. To his credit, he suffered their attentions patiently without encouraging them.</p><p>Julia focused on her own interactions, but she couldn\u2019t help but keep apprised of where he was situated and with whom. She also marked Christa\u2019s position, but she was never far from Professor Pacciani.</p><p>Julia found the fact curious.</p><p>Pacciani\u2019s eyes seemed to follow her and on one occasion, she was certain he winked. But he made no attempt to approach or speak with her. He seemed content to remain at Christa\u2019s side, despite her occasionally flirtatious behavior with other men.</p><p>Julia sipped her tea as she listened to professor after professor regale her with tales of their latest research projects, longing for the end of the day.</p><p>During the final lecture, Gabriel noticed Julia squirming in her seat. She\u2019d been doing so for an hour, as if she were in desperate need of the ladies\u2019 room.</p><p>Gabriel had been nursing his irritation with Christa for hours, fanning the embers with myriad justifications for his words and actions. He was in the middle of composing a self-righteous speech that he intended to deliver to Julia when they were back at Magdalen, when she stunned him by passing a note.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to fight.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Thank you for defending me.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry she mentioned Professor Pain.</p><p>Gabriel reread the note twice.</p><p>The sight of Julia\u2019s contrition in black and white made his heart constrict. She\u2019d said that she was sorry, even though she\u2019d done almost nothing.</p><p>He would have appreciated more support from her. He coveted her compassion\u2014compassion for a plight brought about because of his strong desire to protect her. But he hadn\u2019t expected an apology.</p><p>Their eyes met and she gave him a tentative smile. The smile, perhaps even more than the note, undid him.</p><p>His irritation cooled, under the frigid waters of remorse.</p><p>Without delay, he turned her note over and wrote,</p><p>Emerson was an ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he hopes you\u2019ll forgive him.</p><p>It took an instant for her to read it. And when she did, she restrained a laugh, resulting in a strangled snort.</p><p>The sound echoed around the room and the lecturer looked up from his notes, wondering how a wild pig had managed to wander into St. Anne\u2019s College in order to attend his paper.</p><p>Blushing furiously, Julia feigned a coughing fit, while Gabriel patted her back. When the lecture eventually continued, he added to his missive,</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry I embarrassed you.</p><p>I promise I\u2019ll do better.</p><p>You are not a speed bump.</p><p>You\u2019re my Beatrice.</p><p>Julia\u2019s delicate features lightened, and he watched as her shoulders relaxed.</p> <p>Hesitantly, she reached out her baby finger and linked it with his own. This was her way of holding his hand without others seeing.</p><p>He curved his pinky around hers, looking at her from out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>Yes, Professor Emerson could be an ass, on occasion. But at least he was sorry.</p><p>After the conference ended for the day, Katherine spirited Julia away to The Eagle and Child pub for a drink. The pub was referred to locally as \u201cThe Bird and Baby,\u201d or \u201cThe Fowl and Foetus.\u201d It was, perhaps, the most famous pub in Oxford. Julia was eager to see it because it had been one of the meeting places of the Inklings, the literary group that included C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Charles Williams.</p><p>Inside, Katherine purchased two pints of Caledonian ale and piloted her former student to a back corner. Once they were comfortable, she clinked their glasses together and took a long pull from her pint.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Julianne. You\u2019re looking well.\u201d Katherine took in her former student\u2019s appearance with a single glance. \u201cYour wedding was a triumph. I haven\u2019t had that much fun in years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you could join us.\u201d Julia gripped her glass a little too tightly, the whiteness of her knuckles telegraphing her nervousness.</p><p>\u201cAre you anxious about your lecture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhat.\u201d Julia sipped her ale, wondering why Katherine had insisted on speaking to her alone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s understandable to be apprehensive, but you\u2019ll do fine. No doubt you\u2019re still a bit shaken after encountering that dreadful woman.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s stomach flipped, and she nodded.</p><p>Katherine noted that the other patrons were engaged in their own conversations before continuing.</p><p>\u201cDid Gabriel ever explain how I came to be in his debt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned something about doing you a favor, but he wasn\u2019t specific.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine tapped her pint thoughtfully with a single unpainted fingernail.</p><p>\u201cI would have thought he\u2019d have told you. But it\u2019s like him to keep another person\u2019s confidence.\u201d</p><p>She removed her glasses, placing them on the table.</p><p>\u201cSix years ago, I was in phased retirement in Toronto. Jeremy Martin hired Gabriel to replace me, but I was still supervising graduate students and teaching a seminar.</p><p>\u201cAt the beginning of the fall semester, I received an email from an old friend here in Oxford. He told me that our former professor, John Hutton, was in hospice dying of cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Professor Hutton\u2019s work. He was one of the sources for my paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld Hut probably forgot more information about Dante than I ever knew.\u201d Katherine\u2019s expression grew almost wistful. \u201cWhen I received news that he was dying, I\u2019d already begun teaching my seminar. And I\u2019d agreed to deliver a series of lectures on Dante and the seven deadly sins for the CBC. I approached Jeremy and asked if it would be possible to take a week off so I could come here.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s sharp gaze missed very little, and she certainly didn\u2019t miss seeing Julia start at the mention of Professor Martin\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cJeremy was an ally to both of you last year. He tried very hard to help Gabriel, but in the end, there was only so much he could do.\u201d</p><p>Julia shifted in her seat. \u201cI always wondered why he helped Christa transfer to his alma mater. There were rumors they were involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumors hurt people. Sometimes, they hurt innocent people. I expect better from you, Mrs. Emerson, than to be listening to gossip about Professor Martin.\u201d</p><p>Julia grew flustered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Jeremy and his wife for years. Believe me, Christa Peterson couldn\u2019t catch his eye if she were naked, holding the original manuscript of The Decameron and a case of beer.\u201d</p><p>Julia stifled a laugh at Professor Picton\u2019s imaginative description, such as it was.</p><p>\u201cTwo days after I explained my situation, Jeremy approached Gabriel. In short order, he volunteered to take over my seminar and any other responsibilities while I was away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Katherine tipped her head to one side. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t surprise you. Gabriel likes to do his good deeds in secret, I think, but that he does them is unremarkable. When he volunteered to help he was a first-year assistant professor, just out of graduate school. It was an extraordinary kindness on his part for someone he knew only in passing. As it happened, I was away until after Christmas, burdening him with everything for four long months. And then afterward, when I came home, he was a very good friend to me. So as you can appreciate, I owe him a debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he was happy to help, Professor. After everything you\u2019ve done for us, the debt is more than forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Katherine paused, peering at their surroundings thoughtfully. \u201cGabriel tells me you\u2019re an admirer of the Inklings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Did you know them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Tolkien once, when I was a little girl. My father was a Beowulf specialist at Leeds and he and Tolkien used to correspond with one another. I came down on the train with my father to visit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d</p><p>Katherine sat back in her chair and regarded the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI liked him. At the time, I simply thought of him as old, like my father. But I can recall that he coaxed me into telling him a story I\u2019d made up about a family of badgers that lived behind our house. He seemed quite taken by it.\u201d She gestured to the corner in which they sat. \u201cThis was the exact spot where the Inklings used to meet.\u201d</p><p>Julia slowly examined the space. As a child, hiding in her room with a stack of Narnia books, she would never have imagined that one day she would be sitting where Lewis sat. It was nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>\u201cThank you for bringing me here.\u201d Her voice almost caught in her throat.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s expression shifted.</p><p>\u201cIt took me almost an entire semester to see Old Hut. When I arrived in Oxford, his wife banned me from the hospice. I showed up every day for weeks, hoping to change her mind, hoping that he wouldn\u2019t pass away before I could see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would be so cruel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask this question after the Shoah? After countless instances of genocide? Human beings can be incredibly cruel.</p><p>\u201cIn the case of Old Hut, I was the cruel one and I paid for it. But that semester, it was Mrs. Hutton\u2019s opportunity to exact her revenge, with interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Professor Picton waved her hand. \u201cGabriel gave me the chance to make my peace. I will always be in his debt, which means I feel a special responsibility for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you able to see your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Hutton\u2019s aunt fell ill. While she was visiting her, I managed to see the professor. By then, he was near death, but we were able to talk.</p><p>\u201cI came back to Toronto and worked through my depression. But I never told Gabriel the entire story, or why it was so important for me to see John before he died.\u201d Katherine pursed her lips, looking as if she were divided about something. Then she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAll the important players are dead, with the exception of me. There\u2019s no point in keeping it a secret.\u201d She looked at Julia over her glass. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to keep things from your husband, but I ask that you be discreet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Professor.\u201d</p><p>Katherine wrapped her aged fingers around her pint.</p><p>\u201cOld Hut and I were involved while I was his student, and afterward, when I taught at Cambridge. He was married. Lucky for me, no one found out about us while I was living here in Oxford. But eventually, there were rumors, and the rumors followed me for ten years.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s mouth dropped open.</p><p>Katherine glanced at her, her blue eyes sparkling in what could have been amusement.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re surprised. But I wasn\u2019t always this old. In my day, I was considered attractive. And is it really so surprising? People work closely together on something they\u2019re passionate about, and that passion has to go somewhere. Dante speaks of it when he describes Paolo and Francesca.\u201d</p><p>Katherine replaced her glasses on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was trying to get an academic position, the gossip became particularly vicious. There were those among my student colleagues who were jealous of Old Hut\u2019s attentions and the fact that he clearly preferred me. Even without evidence of our amour, they began circulating stories that he authored my research. In fact, someone wrote to the University of Cambridge after I\u2019d applied for a job there, claiming that Old Hut wrote a letter of recommendation for me simply because I was sleeping with him.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed.</p><p>Then she clapped a hand to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. That isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s eyes twinkled.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s funny. You should have seen his recommendation letter. He wrote, Miss Picton is competent in the study of Dante. I was his lover, for God\u2019s sake. Don\u2019t you think he could have troubled himself to write more than one sentence?\u201d</p><p>While Julia stared in horror, Professor Picton chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI can make light of it now, but I was unhappy for many years. I fell in love with a married man and I mourned not having him all to myself. No marriage, no children. Once I began presenting my research, the rumors died. People heard my lectures, some of which disagreed with Old Hut\u2019s positions, and they realized I knew what I was talking about. I worked very hard to make a name for myself and to come out from under his shadow. That\u2019s why when he was dying, the only other person who knew what had transpired between me and Old Hut was his wife.\u201d</p><p>Katherine stared at Julia intently.</p><p>\u201cI tried my best to discredit Miss Peterson this morning and I will continue to do so. But even if I fail, eventually everyone will move on to the latest scandal. By the time you have your own faculty position, the rumors will be forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s six years away, Professor.\u201d</p><p>Professor Picton smiled. \u201cGiven what I\u2019ve shared with you this evening, I think you should call me Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Katherine.\u201d Julia returned her smile shyly.</p><p>\u201cYou can help people forget the gossip by being excellent. If you prove yourself, all the gossip in the world can\u2019t diminish it. It\u2019s possible you\u2019ll have to work harder than others, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re bothered by hard work. Are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Katherine sat back in her chair. \u201cMy next piece of advice will be a little bit more difficult to hear.\u201d</p><p>Julia braced herself for the words to come.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be more assertive, academically. I understand that it\u2019s your nature to be shy and that you\u2019d prefer to avoid confrontation. But in the academic arena, you cannot do that. When you deliver a paper and someone challenges you, you have to challenge him right back. You can\u2019t sustain misguided or malicious criticisms, especially in public. Do you understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t seem to have trouble speaking up in my seminars. Professor Marinelli has been pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. My advice is to be yourself tomorrow. Be bright. Be excellent. And don\u2019t let yourself be ravaged by wolves like some diseased moose.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened at the strange reference, but she said nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t let your husband defend you, either. That will make you look weak. You need to defend yourself and your ideas if you\u2019re going to be successful. Gabriel isn\u2019t going to like that. But you must make him see that when he comes to your aid, he makes you look helpless, and that does more harm than good. Chivalry in academia is dead.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded a bit uncertainly.</p> <p>Katherine finished her pint.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s see if Gabriel has managed to charm the old bastards of the Oxford Dante Society into forgetting what they might have heard this morning.\u201d She winked. \u201cFor some of them, what they heard would only make him more appealing. I\u2019m afraid your husband is far more interesting than any of them could have imagined.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel spent his time apart from Julianne wisely. He visited with old friends and new acquaintances at the King\u2019s Arms pub, putting his silver tongue to good use. By the end of the hour, he\u2019d succeeded in giving a half a dozen Dante specialists reason to think that Christa Peterson was a jealous ex-student and that he and Julia were the victims of slander.</p><p>So it was with a markedly improved mood that he joined Professor Picton and Julia for dinner. Katherine spoke fluidly as the wine flowed, while Gabriel kept up his end of the conversation.</p><p>Julia was quiet, even more so than usual, her large eyes tired. She merely picked at her dinner and couldn\u2019t even be tempted by dessert. It was clear that the events of the day had caught up with her.</p><p>When she excused herself to go to the ladies\u2019 room, Katherine gave Gabriel a concerned look.</p> <p>\u201cShe needs rest. The poor girl is worn out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s expression was thoughtful, but he didn\u2019t comment further.</p><p>Katherine nodded at his empty wine glass. \u201cYou\u2019ve stopped drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d He offered her a patient smile.</p><p>\u201cNot a bad idea. I go through periods of teetotaling myself.\u201d She wiped her lips with her napkin. \u201cWill you accept some maternal advice, from someone who is not your mother?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel turned to her abruptly. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry sometimes about your ability to handle your detractors. Especially now that you\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>He started to disagree but she interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m old, I can behave how I wish. But you cannot be Julianne\u2019s champion at academic conferences. If you rise to her defense, you\u2019ll make her look weak.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel folded his napkin and placed it on the table. \u201cThe incident this morning with Christa Peterson was anomalous. She tried to destroy our careers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so. But even in that case, I\u2019m afraid you did more harm than good.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel frowned, and Katherine decided to change tactics.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been good friends, you and I. I\u2019d like to think that if I\u2019d had a son, he would be your equal in intelligence and talent.\u201d</p><p>His expression softened. \u201cThank you, Katherine. Your friendship is important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given Julianne some advice. No doubt she\u2019ll tell you all about our conversation. But before she returns, I\u2019d ask that you consider what I\u2019ve just said. She\u2019s a nice young woman and very bright. Let her brightness shine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I want.\u201d He looked down at his hands. His eyes were drawn to the way the light caught on his wedding band, and he found himself staring at it.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Katherine tapped her finger on the table, as if to signal that the matter had been decided. \u201cNow, I hope I\u2019ll be invited to dinner at your house when I give my lecture series at Harvard in January. Greg Matthews always takes me to these appalling molecular gastronomy restaurants that serve you deconstructed entr\u00e9es cooked in liquid nitrogen. I can never decide whether I\u2019m having dinner or sitting for an exam in organic chemistry.\u201d</p><p>After dinner, Gabriel insisted that they escort Katherine to her residence at All Souls, where they bade one another good night and agreed to meet for breakfast the following morning.</p><p>\u201cEight thirty, sharp.\u201d Katherine tapped her wristwatch. \u201cDon\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d Gabriel bowed.</p><p>\u201cSee that you don\u2019t.\u201d With a wave, she disappeared behind the great wooden door of the college, which closed behind her.</p><p>Left standing together, Gabriel took Julia\u2019s hand, noticing that her fingers had grown cold. He tried to warm them, touching her wedding band and engagement ring.</p><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019re tired,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to show you something. It will just take a minute.\u201d</p><p>He led her around the corner to Radcliffe Camera, a great, circular building that had become an icon of the university. The sky was dark, moonless, but a few lights illuminated the impressive structure.</p><p>He squeezed her hand as they approached. \u201cI used to spend a lot of time walking around this building. I\u2019ve always admired it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic.\u201d</p><p>Julia eagerly perused the architecture and its interplay of stone and dome and pillar. The sky was the color of ink, and the dome almost seemed to glow against its backdrop.</p><p>Gabriel brought his hands to cup her cheeks. \u201cI want to speak to you about what happened this morning.\u201d</p><p>He felt her tense beneath his touch. His eyes sought hers and he moved his thumbs gently across her cheekbones. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for embarrassing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it was difficult for you to walk away from her at first. But you did. And I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201d Her dark eyes glinted. \u201cYou still like to fight.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel took her hands in his and pulled them into his chest.</p><p>\u201cI like to fight with people other than you. Christa is a bully. The only way to deal with bullies is to confront them.\u201d</p><p>Julia lifted her chin. \u201cSometimes, you should let the nastiness speak for itself. Or at least, let her target decide for herself what\u2019s to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that. At least, I can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask.\u201d Julia brushed her lips against his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry she brought up Professor Pain. I had no idea they knew each other.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel closed his eyes. When he opened them, they were pained.</p><p>\u201cI confessed my past. I left it behind. Must I be reminded of it forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She wrapped her arms around his back, bringing their chests together.</p><p>They were quiet for a moment and Gabriel pushed his face into her neck, clutching her tightly.</p><p>\u201cCaravaggio,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember what you said about his painting of St. Thomas and Jesus\u2014how our scars might heal but they never disappear. You can\u2019t eliminate your past but you don\u2019t have to be controlled by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. But I doubt anyone would want their sexual encounters broadcasted to their work colleagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone who would judge you based on old gossip isn\u2019t a friend of yours, anyway.\u201d She pulled back so she could look into his eyes. \u201cThose of us who know you will ignore the gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He pressed his lips to her forehead before meeting her gaze. \u201cPeople and circumstances will conspire to alienate us from one another, Julianne. We can\u2019t let them do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to ignore you. You mean more to me than anything,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me.\u201d</p><p>She breached the distance between their mouths in order to kiss him, her lips soft and ever moving.</p><p>Some distance away, Professor Giuseppe Pacciani groaned his release and collapsed on top of his lover\u2019s body. Sex with her was always magnificent, and this coupling was no exception.</p><p>He mumbled a few phrases in Italian, as was his custom. But instead of welcoming his words, she pushed him aside and rolled away. Sadly, this was not unusual.</p><p>\u201cCara?\u201d</p><p>Christa Peterson pulled the sheet over her naked body. \u201cI need the room tomorrow night. You\u2019ll have to stay somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>With a curse, Giuseppe eased his bare feet to the floor. He walked to the bathroom to dispose of the condom. \u201cThis is my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she called to him. \u201cIt\u2019s my room. You always pay for my accommodations. And I\u2019ll be entertaining tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>He returned to the bed and soon she was under him again, his forearms on either side of her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d take someone to your bed so soon? The sheets will still be warm.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes flashed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge me. You\u2019re married. Who I fuck is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>He bent down and kissed her, his lips insistent until she opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSuch a dirty mouth, Cristina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it when I\u2019m dirty.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, and his expression morphed into a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d</p><p>He moved to his back, taking her with him.</p><p>\u201cI want to get up.\u201d She pulled against his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She struggled but he would not let her go. Finally, she relented, resting her head against him.</p><p>He toyed with her hair. This was part of their arrangement. Afterward, she had to let him hold her.</p><p>Perhaps he did so simply to satisfy himself that there was something affectionate about their fucking. Perhaps he did so because he was not an entirely ruthless adulterer. But whatever the reason, she always resisted for a moment or two, even though she secretly liked being held.</p><p>\u201cI was surprised to hear from you, Cristina. We were supposed to meet a year ago. You never answered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was busy.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the ends of her raven hair to his nose, inhaling its fragrance.</p><p>\u201cI wondered why you insisted I bring you. You\u2019re here for revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both getting what we wanted.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stilled.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Cristina. You don\u2019t want Professor Picton as an enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Pacciani cursed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand the patronage system? Departments around the world are filled with her admirers. Your chair at Columbia was her student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d Christa shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. I\u2019ve already pissed her off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pacciani grabbed Christa\u2019s chin roughly, forcing her to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m responsible for you now.

Certo.</p><p>\u201cAll the time I\u2019ve known you, you\u2019ve had lovers but no suitors. You should be married. You should be having babies. Instead, you fuck old men for expensive gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuck you for your gifts. I fuck you because I like to fuck.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p> <p>\u201cGrazie. But still, there must always be gifts.\u201d He brought his lips to her forehead. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like nice things. That isn\u2019t a crime. And I\u2019m worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think, tesoro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me that.\u201d She pulled away.</p><p>His hand wrapped around the back of her neck, holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re worth it, which is why you demand gifts. Sad, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have it, all the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019re a fool.\u201d</p><p>His grip on her tightened. \u201cYou fuck priests and old, married men because you\u2019re afraid. You\u2019re afraid of what might happen if you were to sleep with someone who was unattached.\u201d</p><p>She struggled in his arms.</p><p>\u201cSince when did you become a psychiatrist? Don\u2019t project your bullshit on me. At least I\u2019m not fucking around on my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttenzione, Cristina.\u201d His tone was a warning. \u201cSo who is the man you fuck tomorrow night? A priest? A professor?\u201d</p><p>She regarded him for a moment, then traced her finger across his lower lip. \u201cWho said it was a man?\u201d</p><p>Giuseppe gave her a ravenous look.</p><p>\u201cThen I expect you to share.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Wake up, darling.\u201d Gabriel ran his thumb over Julia\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cYou need to get ready.\u201d</p><p>She buried her face in the pillow and mumbled something unintelligible.</p><p>He chuckled, thinking about how adorable she looked.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you need to grab the shower before one of our neighbors occupies it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already showered, shaved, and dressed, darling.\u201d He ran the back of his hand down her naked spine, taking pleasure in the tremor that resulted.</p><p>\u201cYou kept me up too late,\u201d she groaned.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get moving, Katherine will be cross with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking a shower. I can sleep longer.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rolled her over and ran his nose along her collarbone, inhaling her scent.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like sex,\u201d he whispered, flicking out his tongue to taste her skin. \u201cAnd me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not taking a shower. We had incredible makeup sex, which I\u2019d like to remember.\u201d</p><p>It was all he could do not to pull the sheets off her and engage in wild, passionate (and scent-transferring) sex. But he quickly restrained his impulses.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t deliver a lecture at Oxford smelling of sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked at his wristwatch. Then he looked at his wife.</p><p>Then he took off all his clothes and commenced in wild, passionate, scent-transferring (albeit quick) preconference sex.</p><p>The Emersons were late departing for All Souls College. On the hurried walk over, Julia told Gabriel the story of Katherine and Old Hut.</p><p>He was surprised. He knew Professor Hutton by reputation but had never met him. Apparently, he was a bit of a bastard.</p><p>(One might wonder how much of a bastard Hutton had been, given the former nature of the professor making the judgment.)</p><p>Gabriel was grateful for Professor Picton\u2019s support and told her so over breakfast inside All Souls, expressing his hope that Christa would forgo the opportunity to make trouble for Julia at her lecture.</p><p>\u201cApplesauce,\u201d said Katherine. \u201cJulianne has the situation in hand and we\u2019d all do well to let her see to it.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled bravely, fidgeting with the silver necklace Gabriel had given her back in Selinsgrove.</p><p>As they entered St. Anne\u2019s after breakfast, Gabriel wrapped an arm around Julia\u2019s waist, hugging her.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely. And you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her navy suit and plain navy pumps. Gabriel had wanted her to wear Prada or Chanel, but she was wary of flaunting their money. She\u2019d rather people focused on her research than her clothes. So she\u2019d purchased a simple jacket and skirt from Ann Taylor, with modestly high-heeled shoes from Nine West. Even so, given the way some of the other conferencegoers dressed (with the exception of Christa Peterson), she felt a bit overdone.</p><p>Underneath her clothes, she knew she wore Gabriel\u2019s scent along with the corset he\u2019d bought for her, which bolstered her confidence considerably.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get a coffee. What would you like?\u201d He smiled and released her.</p><p>\u201cA bottle of water, please. I\u2019d like to sit down, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. See you in there.\u201d</p><p>Julia returned his smile and entered the lecture theater alone.</p><p>Gabriel exchanged a few pleasantries with some colleagues before he approached the refreshment table. By the time he\u2019d poured his drink and taken a bottle of water, everyone had exited.</p><p>Or so he thought.</p><p>\u201cHello, Professor.\u201d</p><p>A sultry voice behind him arrested his attention. Gabriel turned to find Christa hovering nearby like a malevolent ghost.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d His expression grew murderous.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to talk yesterday. So\u2014talk.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel glanced around the empty room, wondering if their voices would carry into the lecture theater.</p><p>Christa stepped closer to him than was appropriate and closed her eyes, inhaling deeply. When she opened them, her eyes were hungry.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play games with me. I want the slander to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sue you.\u201d</p><p>Something flitted across her face, but she quickly pulled her features into a relaxed smile.</p><p>\u201cFor what? Telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no truth to your character assassinations. You weren\u2019t harassed back in Toronto. And Julia does her own research, as is obvious to anyone with half a brain.\u201d</p><p>The sound of laughter echoed from the lecture theater. Gabriel turned in its direction.</p><p>Christa lifted her voice to regain his attention.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting the part where you fucked one of your students and were placed on administrative leave. That\u2019s a story worth telling. Not to mention the fact that Professor Singer had quite a bit to say about you. It\u2019s a pity she didn\u2019t take photographs. I would have liked one.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to brush imaginary lint off the lapels of his navy blue suit.</p><p>He caught her hand at the wrist and squeezed. Hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire.\u201d</p><p>She leaned even closer, bringing her mouth within inches of his. \u201cOh, I hope so, Professor.\u201d</p><p>With disgust he released her, stepping back and wiping his hands as if they\u2019d been contaminated. With another glance toward the theater, he decided to end their confrontation.</p><p>\u201cYou keep your mouth shut. Or I\u2019ll make your life a living hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be unfriendly. The power to end this is in your hands.\u201d She gestured to his crotch, her lips turning up into an appreciative smile. \u201cActually, it\u2019s a bit lower.\u201d</p><p>He muttered an expletive and began to walk away, but she followed him.</p><p>\u201cCome to my hotel and tomorrow, you won\u2019t have to worry about my talented mouth anymore.\u201d She placed her hand on his arm, dropping her voice to a seductive whisper. \u201cI know you. I know what you like and I know what you want. We\u2019ll fuck all night then go our separate ways.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her hand away roughly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happens next is on your conscience.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel took a step in her direction. \u201cYou stay away from my wife, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the Malmaison. It used to be a prison, which should appeal to you.\u201d She reached up to bring her lips to his ear. \u201cI brought handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was too busy pushing her away to realize that she\u2019d dropped something into his suit pocket.</p><p>With a smirk, she waved.</p><p>\u201cTonight is your only chance. Come before midnight.\u201d</p><p>She turned on her very high heels, swaying seductively as she walked. Then, almost as an afterthought, she paused and looked at him over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGive my best to your wife.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>A few minutes later, Gabriel scanned the crowd of the lecture theater, looking for Julia. His eyes widened as he took in the scene at the front of the room. Julia was being hugged. By someone large. By someone male.</p><p>By someone\u2014handsome.</p><p>Gabriel took the stairs two at a time in order to reach the front of the hall. He watched as Julia pulled back from the man, her face happy, her kissable lips curved up into a smile.</p><p>The man reluctantly withdrew his arms from her waist before saying something that caused her to laugh.</p><p>Gabriel was ready to strangle the man, and then he was going to challenge him to a duel.</p><p>As he approached, Julia\u2019s eyes found his. The man turned in the direction of her gaze.</p><p>Gabriel stopped short.</p><p>\u201cAngelfucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>Paul Norris squinted at his former dissertation supervisor, not quite sure he\u2019d heard what he thought he\u2019d heard. Certainly, he had his own favored descriptors for the Professor, few of which were complimentary.</p><p>Studentfucker, Paul thought.</p><p>\u201cThis conference keeps getting better and better,\u201d Gabriel muttered, straightening himself to his full height of six feet two inches.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Emerson.\u201d Paul subconsciously flexed his biceps and broadened his chest.</p><p>\u201cPaul.\u201d Gabriel moved to Julia\u2019s side possessively, handing her the bottle of water.</p><p>\u201cShake hands, gentlemen.\u201d She frowned, looking between her friend and her husband.</p><p>The men followed her suggestion less than enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming.\u201d Gabriel looked pointedly at Paul.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. One of the presenters backed out, so Professor Picton invited me. I\u2019m giving the paper just before Julia\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Paul beamed in return. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan I take you to lunch?\u201d He focused solely on Julia.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid she already has plans.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave her husband what could only be referred to as the look before nodding at Paul.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to go to lunch with you. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel clutched Julia\u2019s elbow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d she whispered back a warning.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Norris,\u201d Katherine interrupted. She shook Paul\u2019s hand firmly before turning to Gabriel. \u201cMr. Norris and I are having dinner this evening. I\u2019d like you and Julianne to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be delighted.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice was strained. \u201cSince we\u2019ll be dining with you this evening, Mr. Norris, I\u2019ll claim my wife for lunch.\u201d He smiled, showing all his gleaming white teeth.</p> <p>\u201cDarling, can I have a word?\u201d Julia asked. She turned to Katherine and Paul. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Julia took Gabriel\u2019s hand and led him to a quiet corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cI want to have lunch with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body.\u201d Gabriel crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old friend who kissed you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was after you left me. As you may recall, I turned him down.\u201d She crossed her arms, mirroring his posture.</p><p>Gabriel scowled. \u201cHe wants you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul is not someone who would make a pass at a married woman. It\u2019s just lunch. So I\u2019m asking you, please, don\u2019t make a big deal out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in a year. I\u2019d like to talk to him and see how he\u2019s doing. Maybe he\u2019s back together with Allison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel crowded her, dropping his voice.</p> <p>\u201cYou forget that women who are beautiful, intelligent, and kind are in short supply. A man would do anything to have a woman like you. Including stealing you from your husband.\u201d</p><p>Julia squared her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou forget that when a woman finds a good man, a man who loves her and makes her happy, she doesn\u2019t fuck around.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel flinched.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it\u2014his eyes found Christa\u2019s and he watched as she taunted him, looking between himself and Julia smugly.</p><p>Gabriel turned back to his wife and uncrossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy about this.\u201d</p><p>Julia reached up to kiss his cheek. \u201cI can live with that. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Within minutes, Gabriel found himself in the unhappy position of having to watch his wife sit next to the Angelfucker, while he sat on her other side. She and her friend exchanged a few playful words before the session began, and Gabriel resented each and every one of them.</p><p>This conference is like a tour through the various levels of Hell, he thought. The only things missing are a respectable Virgil and hordes of people screaming.</p><p>It was one thing to suffer the slings and arrows of Miss Peterson. It was quite another to find his wife in the arms of another man. And in the arms of the Angelfucker, of all people.</p><p>Gabriel started reciting the prayer of St. Francis in Italian in an effort to calm down.</p><p>He knew that he should tell Julia about his confrontation with Christa. But he also knew that it would upset her, potentially ruining her opportunity to appear poised and self-confident in front of the conference attendees. So he kept the distasteful details to himself.</p><p>Besides, he had Mr. Norris to worry about.</p><p>Paul had been a good and loyal friend to Julia, especially when she\u2019d needed him. But he\u2019d made a play for her, something Gabriel understood but would never forgive.</p><p>He wanted to keep Julia as far away from him as possible. But the look on her face when she saw him killed that possibility. She\u2019d had precious little to smile about the day before. Gabriel was not about to kill that look.</p><p>He tapped his foot quietly as the first conference speaker began her presentation. He was absolutely oblivious to the distracting noise his handmade Italian shoes were making against the floor until Julia laid a gentle hand on top of his knee.</p><p>He took out his Meisterst\u00fcck 149 and toyed with it, trying in vain to flip it over his fingers in a single motion.</p><p>In an effort to distract himself from a paper he swore he\u2019d heard before, he thought back to his very public fight with Julia, when she\u2019d been a student in his seminar. She\u2019d provoked him in front of Paul, Christa, and the rest of the class. He\u2019d been horribly embarrassed and furious. In his rage, he\u2019d even destroyed what had been a very serviceable Ikea chair.</p><p>He\u2019d learned a great deal from Julia in the interim, not least of which was the importance of forgiving others and one\u2019s self. But Julia\u2019s pacifist tendencies were too extreme. Without him, or someone like him, she\u2019d been broken and abused.</p><p>Gabriel watched her thoughtfully. Perhaps she\u2019d become a pacifist because she\u2019d been abused. Perhaps the bearer of scars was all too aware of the damage that could be done by vicious words and deeds. He pondered that insight for some time, staring at her, until she squirmed.</p><p>Julianne was beautiful, with clear skin and large eyes, but she didn\u2019t know it. She didn\u2019t see what others saw, and although she\u2019d made much progress since they\u2019d been together, Gabriel knew that her self-image would always be less than it should be. He knew this and because of it, he was careful to protect her, even from himself.</p><p>He certainly wouldn\u2019t let the Angelfucker capitalize on her weaknesses.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>January 2011</p><p>Near Essex Junction, Vermont</p><p>Paul Norris stepped into a very large pile of cow shit.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he exclaimed, lifting his boot.</p><p>Bessie, one of his father\u2019s prized Holsteins, cast him a baleful look.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Bessie. I meant fudge.\u201d He patted the cow on her neck and began to clean off his boot.</p><p>As he shoveled manure in his father\u2019s barn in the early morning, he contemplated the inner workings of the universe, karma, and what his life had become. Then he thought about her.</p><p>Julia was going to marry the bastard. By this time tomorrow, the wedding would be over.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>After everything Emerson had put her through . . . after all of his paternalistic, asinine, controlling bullshit. She took him back. Worse\u2014she didn\u2019t just take him back; she was marrying him.</p><p>Emerson the ass.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why do good guys always finish last?</p><p>Why do the Emersons of the world always get the girl?</p><p>There is no justice in the universe. He gets the girl and I\u2019m shoveling shit.</p><p>Julia said that he\u2019d changed, but really, how much could one man change in the space of six months?</p><p>He was glad he hadn\u2019t accepted the invitation to the wedding. To have to stand there and watch them look into one another\u2019s eyes and say their vows, knowing all the while that Emerson was going to take her to a hotel somewhere and . . .</p><p>Paul groaned the groan of a man in love who\u2019d lost his beloved.</p><p>(At least he had a lot of shit with which to occupy his time.)</p><p>He was working on his parents\u2019 farm in Vermont because his father was recovering from a heart attack. Despite his recovery, the doctors instructed him to refrain from performing manual labor.</p><p>Walking back to the house from the barn at eight o\u2019clock, Paul was ready for breakfast. It was cold and the wind whistled through the trees that a Norris ancestor had planted as a windbreak around the large farmhouse. Even Max, the family\u2019s border collie, was cold. He ran in circles, barking at the falling snow and begging to be let inside.</p><p>A car traveled up the long drive from the main road, stopping inches from Paul\u2019s feet. He recognized the car immediately\u2014a lime green Volkswagen beetle. And he recognized the driver as she opened her door and placed one Ugg-clad foot after the other onto the freshly plowed driveway.</p><p>Allison had dark curly hair, freckles, and snapping blue eyes. She was funny, she was smart, and she was a kindergarten teacher in nearby Burlington. She was also Paul\u2019s ex-girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She waved. \u201cI brought coffee from Dunkie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Paul saw that she was carrying a tray that had four large coffees from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and a bag that contained mysterious treats. Treats that he hoped included fried dough covered in sugar.</p><p>\u201cGo inside. It\u2019s freezing out here.\u201d Paul waved his gloved hand at the house and followed Allison and Max through the snow.</p><p>Paul pulled off his boots and outdoor clothes in the mudroom, placing his gloves on a rack to dry. Then he began washing his hands, scrubbing vigorously under the warm water.</p><p>He could hear his mother, Louise, speaking to Allison in low tones in the kitchen. She didn\u2019t sound surprised at Ali\u2019s sudden appearance. Paul began to wonder if her appearance wasn\u2019t all that sudden.</p><p>When he entered the kitchen, his mother disappeared with two of the coffees.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your dad?\u201d Allison handed him his cup.</p><p>He sipped it quickly, wanting to put off his answer. The coffee was perfect\u2014black with two sugars. Ali knew how he liked his coffee.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better.\u201d Paul\u2019s voice was stiff as he sat across from her at the kitchen table. \u201cHe keeps trying to work, and Mom keeps telling him not to. At least he didn\u2019t make it out of the house this morning. She caught him in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sent flowers to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw them. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>They sat quietly, awkwardly, until Allison reached her hand across the table to take Paul\u2019s large paw in hers.</p><p>\u201cI heard about the wedding.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYour mom told my mom. They ran into each other at Hannaford\u2019s.\u201d She rolled her eyes.</p><p>He shook his head but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry. She\u2019s clearly a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t, but thanks.\u201d He squeezed her hand. He was going to withdraw, but it felt nice to hold her hand. It felt familiar and comfortable and God knew that he needed comfort, so he kept it there.</p><p>She smiled and sipped her coffee. \u201cI know this is a bad time. I just wanted to let you know that I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his weight, focusing on his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go to a movie?\u201d she blurted. \u201cI mean, sometime. Not right now. It\u2019s too early to go to a movie now.\u201d Her cheeks pinked up as she searched Paul\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He released her hand and sat back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want things to be weird between us. We\u2019ve been friends forever and we promised each other we\u2019d always be friends.\u201d She began to score the sides of her coffee cup with her fingernail.</p><p>\u201cThings are just\u2014difficult right now.\u201d</p><p>Allison scratched at the surface of the cup.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to rope you into something. I really want to be friends. I know you\u2019re busy and\u2014stuff.\u201d She began ripping off small pieces of her coffee cup and placing them neatly on the kitchen table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d Paul\u2019s hand shot out across the table to catch hers mid-rip. \u201cRelax.\u201d</p><p>She looked into his eyes and saw acceptance and kindness. She exhaled in relief.</p><p>Paul withdrew his hand again, wrapping it around his cup.</p><p>\u201cWe have a history and it\u2019s a good one. But I don\u2019t want to jump back into something with you. It would be too easy to do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been easy, Paul.\u201d She sounded offended.</p><p>He cleared his throat and looked her straight in the eye. \u201cI never said you were. What I mean is it would be tempting to go back to what we had because it was comfortable. You deserve to be with someone who\u2019s serious and not half in it.\u201d</p><p>Paul lost himself in the momentary silence that followed before realizing that Allison was waiting for something.</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. So are we on for a movie sometime or what? I might even take you to dinner at Leunig\u2019s, now that I\u2019m pulling in the big bucks as a teacher.\u201d</p> <p>Paul found himself smiling, and his smile was genuine.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you let me take you to breakfast at Mirabelle\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your coat.\u201d</p><p>He followed her to the back door and helped her with her coat. When she nearly toppled over trying to put her Uggs back on, he knelt on the sandy, salt-licked floor and slid them on her feet.</p><p>\u201cHalf of you is better than the whole of anyone,\u201d she whispered, if only to herself.</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>July 2011</p><p>Oxford, England</p><p>At the beginning of the conference\u2019s lunch break, Julia excused herself to go to the ladies\u2019 room, asking Paul to wait for her return. She was ascending the staircase on her way back to the lecture theater when a pair of Christian Louboutins came into view.</p><p>Julia\u2019s gaze traveled up a pair of legs clad in silk stockings to a black pencil skirt, to a fitted jacket, and thence to the face of Christa Peterson.</p><p>Her expression was hostile but noticeably tense as she clutched the railing with whitened knuckles. She shifted her weight between her feet as if she were uncertain whether to proceed or to retreat.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear your paper. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a few questions.\u201d</p><p>Julia ignored her and tried to move forward, but Christa blocked her.</p> <p>Julia huffed impatiently. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, we do.\u201d</p><p>Julia screwed her eyes shut before opening them incredulously. \u201cSeriously? You want to have this argument here, at a conference? Don\u2019t you see how your actions are hurting your career? Gabriel says that Columbia made you enroll in the M.Phil rather than the PhD. You burned bridges in Toronto, and you\u2019re burning them here. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to let things go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give up that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour vendetta is ridiculous. I never did anything to you.\u201d</p><p>Christa laughed darkly.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t about you. You aren\u2019t worth troubling about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>Christa tossed her hair. \u201cYou have something I want. I always get what I want. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d Julia lifted her chin defiantly.</p><p>Christa\u2019s almond-shaped eyes passed over Julia from head to foot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what he sees in you. You aren\u2019t that pretty.\u201d She waved a contemptuous hand at Julia\u2019s unassuming suit and less-than-designer shoes.</p><p>\u201cGabriel is beautiful. He\u2019s a legend. All the women at Lobby knew him and all of them wanted to fuck him.\u201d She looked at Julia scornfully. \u201cYet, somehow out of everyone, he ends up with you. But you won\u2019t be able to keep him. He needs to be with a woman whose appetite is as voracious as his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>Christa laughed, the sound tinny and brittle. \u201cHardly. I\u2019m sure he enjoyed the conquest, at the beginning. But now he\u2019s had you, his eye will wander and you\u2019ll lose him.\u201d Her eyes flashed with a knowing light. \u201cHe\u2019s probably cheated on you already. Or he\u2019s planning to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t let me go, I\u2019m calling for help. Do you really want to be embarrassed in front of everyone? Again?\u201d</p><p>Christa hesitated, and Julia took the opportunity to brush past her. She was two steps from the top of the staircase before she stopped. She turned around.</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wondering what Gabriel sees in me. The answer is love. I know about the other women. He hasn\u2019t kept secrets from me. But they aren\u2019t a threat.\u201d</p><p>Christa put her hands on her hips. \u201cYou\u2019re delusional. So you love him. So what? Look at yourself. Why would he want such a vanilla little mouse when he could have a tiger in his bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter a loving mouse than an indifferent tiger.\u201d Julia straightened her shoulders. \u201cThose women didn\u2019t see who he truly is. They didn\u2019t care that he was miserable. They would have used him until there was nothing left and then thrown him away. I\u2019ve loved him since I was seventeen. I love all of him\u2014the light and the dark, the good and the bad. That\u2019s why he\u2019s with me. He left the others behind and he will never go back. So do your worst, Christa. But if you\u2019re planning to seduce my husband, you\u2014will\u2014fail.\u201d</p><p>Julia turned to walk away but stopped again, facing Christa one last time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about one thing, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d Christa sounded contemptuous.</p><p>Julia smiled knowingly. \u201cMy husband is an exceptional lover. He\u2019s attentive, creative, and absolutely mind-blowing. And tonight and every night, the woman enjoying his adventurous nature will be me.\u201d</p><p>She gave Christa a long look.</p><p>\u201cNot bad for a mouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had another run-in with Christa.\u201d Paul\u2019s tone was sympathetic as he escorted Julia from St. Anne\u2019s to a small Lebanese restaurant that was within walking distance. \u201cI guess she\u2019s only here to harass you.\u201d</p><p>Julia fidgeted with her wedding ring, moving it back and forth with her thumb.</p><p>\u201cShe told me she was going to ask questions after my paper. She\u2019s going to try to make me look stupid.\u201d</p><p>Paul wrapped his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t make you look stupid because you aren\u2019t stupid. You stand your ground. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her before removing his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou look good. Much better than the last time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, recalling when she\u2019d said good-bye to Paul outside her apartment in Cambridge the summer before. She\u2019d been thinner and sadder, but cautiously optimistic that life at Harvard would suit her.</p><p>\u201cMarried life agrees with me.\u201d</p><p>Paul grimaced. He didn\u2019t want to think about what Julia\u2019s married life included, because he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her sleeping with Professor Emerson. He hoped to God Emerson had given up his penchant for BDSM and treated Julia with gentleness.</p><p>An image of Emerson tying Julia up flashed through his mind. His stomach rolled.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Julia peered up at him. \u201cYou look a little green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve just noticed that the Rabbit is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was about time, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss her.\u201d</p><p>Julia focused her attention on the sidewalk in front of them.</p><p>\u201cShe returns at tense moments. My legs are wobbly just thinking about standing in front of all those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it. Just pretend you\u2019re presenting your paper to me. Ignore everyone else.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively, Paul reached out to take her hand but stopped himself.</p><p>He gestured to her awkwardly, trying to disguise his movement.</p><p>\u201cUh, you cut your hair.\u201d</p><p>She tugged one of the dark locks that fell short of her shoulders. \u201cI thought it would look more professional. Gabriel doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>(Paul neglected to mention the fact that he agreed with the Professor.)</p><p>He gestured to her left hand. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a rock you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Gabriel picked it.\u201d</p><p>Of course he\u2019d buy her a big-ass ring, Paul thought. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t have his name tattooed on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI would have married him with a ring from a box of Cracker Jack.\u201d Julia looked at her hand wistfully. \u201cI would have married him with a tie from a garbage bag. I don\u2019t care about this kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>Exactly. I could have never given her a ring like that. But Julia is the kind of girl who would be happy with next to nothing, provided she loved the guy enough.</p><p>\u201cHe paid off my student loans,\u201d she offered quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat, all of them?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI was going to consolidate them and start making payments, but he insisted on paying them.\u201d</p><p>Paul whistled. \u201cThat must have cost him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did. It\u2019s taken some getting used to\u2014the fact that we share everything including a bank account. I had a very small checking account when we got married. He had . . . more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you like living in Cambridge?\u201d Paul changed the subject, far from eager to learn how much more the Professor had.</p><p>\u201cI love it. We live close enough to Harvard so I can walk. Which is good, because I don\u2019t drive.\u201d Julia sounded sheepish.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept getting lost and ending up in sketchy neighborhoods. I called Gabriel from Dorchester one night and he had a fit. And that was after I\u2019d used the GPS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up in Dorchester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe GPS screwed up. It didn\u2019t recognize one-way streets. It even told me to do an illegal U-turn while I was driving through one of the underpasses. So I ended up farther and farther away from my house. After that, I quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t drive at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the greater Boston area. Gabriel\u2019s Range Rover is difficult to park and I was always worried I was going to hit someone. Boston drivers are crazy. And don\u2019t get me started on the pedestrians.\u201d</p><p>Paul resisted the urge to itemize Gabriel\u2019s myriad failings, and settled on one.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he get you a new car? Obviously, he can afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want something small, like a Smart car or one of those new Fiats. Gabriel says they\u2019re like driving a can of tuna.\u201d She sighed. \u201cHe wants me in something bigger, like a Hummer.\u201d</p><p>He bumped her shoulder playfully. \u201cPlanning on invading Baghdad? Or just Charlestown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. If I can\u2019t parallel park the Range Rover, how the hell am I going to park a Hummer?\u201d</p><p>Paul laughed, opening the door to the restaurant.</p><p>Before he could ask the host for a table for two, a commotion emerged from a nearby table. A little girl, who was probably three or four years old, was hitting a button on her book repeatedly, generating a few bars of a song over and over again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the girl continued this behavior, Paul and Julia looked around the restaurant. The other patrons were less than impressed.</p><p>A woman who was modestly dressed and wearing a hijab tried to persuade the girl to exchange her musical book for another, nonmusical one. But the girl shrieked in protest.</p><p>It was at that moment that an older man who had been sitting near them noisily demanded that the waiter silence the girl. He further complained that she was ruining his lunch and that children who cannot behave themselves should not be allowed in restaurants.</p><p>The woman flushed a deep red and tried once again to persuade her daughter to switch books. But once again, the girl refused, kicking loudly against the table leg.</p> <p>At that moment, the host approached them.</p><p>\u201cA table for two,\u201d said Paul cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cBy the window?\u201d The host gestured to a table in the far corner, next to the window.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Paul moved to follow the host as he retrieved two menus.</p><p>As they were walking across the dining room, Julia noticed that the older man was still grumbling about the little girl and that she was still playing her music loudly and erratically. Julia wondered briefly if the little girl was autistic. Regardless, she was appalled at the older man\u2019s behavior.</p> <p>She addressed the host. \u201cMaybe we could trade tables with the girl and her mother? If they don\u2019t want to move, that\u2019s fine. But the girl might like to look out the window and she\u2019d be able to play with her book in peace.\u201d</p><p>The host glanced in the direction of Julia\u2019s hand, noting the increasing discomfort of the other diners.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, before approaching mother and child.</p><p>The mother and the host had a quick exchange in Arabic, and then the mother addressed her daughter in English.</p><p>\u201cMaia, we can sit by the window. Isn\u2019t that nice? We can look out at the cars.\u201d</p><p>The little girl followed her mother\u2019s gesture to the table in the corner. She blinked a little behind her thick glasses and nodded.</p> <p>\u201cMaia, can you say thank you?\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s name seemed to carry across the restaurant. At the sound of it, Julia startled. She found herself staring at the child, her body frozen.</p><p>Maia looked up at the host and mumbled, while the mother smiled at Julia and Paul.</p><p>A few minutes later, mother and child were happily situated in the corner. The little girl pressed her face against the window, looking outside at the cars and pedestrians, her musical book forgotten.</p><p>Julia and Paul were seated at the other table, next to the now triumphant older man. They ordered a few plates to share and quietly sipped their drinks.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me first.\u201d Paul\u2019s voice broke into Julia\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t mind sitting here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. In fact, it\u2019s better that you dealt with the situation because I was about to walk over to that guy and talk to him. What a jerk.\u201d</p> <p>Julia looked at the man who\u2019d been so censorious and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I continue to be surprised by people\u2019s insensitivity. But I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you are. I know too many cynical people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes flickered to the mother and child. \u201cAre you planning to have a Maia of your own anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>Julia winced, the child\u2019s name continuing to jar her.</p><p>\u201cNo. Um, not yet, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Paul gazed at her for a moment, his large, dark eyes radiating concern.</p><p>\u201cYou look panicked. Are you worried about having kids?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want kids. But later on.\u201d She sipped her water. \u201cHow\u2019s your father?\u201d</p><p>Paul considered exploring her anxiety but thought better of it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay. I\u2019m still at the farm helping out, so I had to let my apartment in Toronto go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your dissertation coming?\u201d</p><p>He snickered. \u201cTerrible. I don\u2019t have a lot of time to write, and now Professor Picton is pissed with me. I was supposed to give her one of my chapters two weeks ago and it isn\u2019t finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you want to write the damn thing for me. I\u2019d like to go on the job market this fall, but Picton won\u2019t let me unless I\u2019m further along.\u201d He sighed loudly. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to be on the farm for at least another year. The longer I\u2019m there, the harder it is to write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>Julia put her glass down and began rubbing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d Paul sounded concerned.</p><p>\u201cA little. My eyes bother me sometimes. It\u2019s probably stress.\u201d She put her hands in her lap. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t want this conversation to be all about me. I\u2019d rather hear how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come to that. When did your eyes start bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I moved to Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of grad students end up with eyestrain. You should get your eyes checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that. Do you wear glasses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I drank a lot of milk growing up. It helped my vision.\u201d</p><p>She appeared puzzled. \u201cI thought carrots did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilk helps everything.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>Paul couldn\u2019t help but appreciate Julia\u2019s beauty, made even more lovely when she laughed.</p><p>He was about to say something but was interrupted by the waiter, who served their lunch. When he withdrew, Julia spoke.</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing anyone?\u201d</p><p>Paul fought a frown.</p><p>\u201cAli and I go out occasionally. But it\u2019s casual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a nice person. She cares about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d His expression darkened.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be happy . . .\u201d</p><p>He changed the subject. \u201cHow are things in your program?\u201d</p><p>Julia toyed with her silverware before answering. \u201cThe professors are tough and I\u2019m working all the time, but I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other students?\u201d</p><p>Julia made a face.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re very competitive. I consider a couple of them friends, but I don\u2019t necessarily trust them. I went to the library once and found that someone had hidden a bunch of the Boccaccio resources so the rest of us couldn\u2019t use them for our seminar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I guess you aren\u2019t spending late nights in the library sharing a carrel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d She nibbled on her food.</p><p>\u201cDo you go out at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRarely. It\u2019s awkward because the other students bring their partners and Gabriel won\u2019t join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to socialize with grad students.\u201d</p><p>Paul bit his tongue. Hard.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to have a baby,\u201d Julia blurted.</p><p>She cringed, immediately regretting her lack of discretion.</p><p>\u201cIt might be a bit difficult, given his biology,\u201d Paul teased. When he saw the look on her face, he grew serious. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right away.\u201d She twisted her linen napkin in her lap. \u201cI want to finish my program. I\u2019m worried if we have a baby, I\u2019ll never graduate.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head, berating herself internally for mentioning so personal a struggle to Paul. Gabriel would be livid if he knew she was sharing these kinds of confidences. But she needed to talk to someone. And Rachel, although sympathetic, did not understand the academic world.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Julia. Have you told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He said he understood. But it\u2019s out there, you know? Once you express that kind of desire, it can\u2019t be taken back.\u201d</p><p>Paul tapped his foot under the table. Their conversation had taken a surprising turn, and truthfully, he didn\u2019t know what to say. He quickly thought of something.</p><p>\u201cThere were some mothers in our program back in Toronto, but only a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they finish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthfully? Most of them didn\u2019t. A lot of the guys had kids. But most of them had wives who either stayed at home or worked part time. . . . Hey.\u201d He waited until she lifted her face. \u201cThat\u2019s a small sample. I wasn\u2019t paying a lot of attention to who was getting pregnant and who wasn\u2019t. There\u2019s probably a group at Harvard that can give you advice about balancing a family and grad school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to have those conversations now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that.\u201d</p><p>Paul shook his head.</p><p>\u201cJules, it\u2019s none of my business, but don\u2019t get pressured into living someone else\u2019s life. If you aren\u2019t ready for a family, say so. And stick to your decision, otherwise you\u2019ll end up miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think having a baby with my husband would make me miserable.\u201d She sounded defensive.</p><p>\u201cDropping out of Harvard would. I know you, Julia. And I know what\u2019s important to you. You\u2019ve been working so hard for this. Don\u2019t throw it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to, but I feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>Paul cursed obliquely.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said he was supportive of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would you feel guilty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m putting myself first. I\u2019m putting my education first, over his happiness.\u201d</p><p>Paul gave her a hard look. \u201cIf he loves you, then he won\u2019t be happy at the cost of your happiness.\u201d</p><p>Julia adjusted the silverware in front of her, lining up the ends so they were perfectly symmetrical.</p><p>\u201cMuch as I hate to say this, I think you should talk to him again. Tell him what you want and ask him to wait.\u201d Paul grinned. \u201cAnd if he won\u2019t, then kick him to the curb.\u201d</p><p>She looked over at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cPaul, I don\u2019t think that\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted her. \u201cSeriously, Julia. If your husband loves you, then he needs to wake the fuck up and cut out the barefoot-and-pregnant bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have no reason to feel guilty. You\u2019re young. You have your whole life ahead of you. You don\u2019t have to choose between grad school and a family. You can have both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only person whose dreams count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d Paul lowered his voice, his eyes fixed on hers. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly objective when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Julia, softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a good friend. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks needed.\u201d His voice grew gruff.</p><p>\u201cFriends are in short supply. Yesterday, Christa told almost everyone about what happened in Toronto. I was humiliated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish someone would shut her up. Permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel tried. They made a scene. Then Professor Picton arrived and threatened to throw Christa out.\u201d</p><p>Paul whistled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed that. Picton and Christa in a steel-cage death match? We could have sold popcorn.\u201d</p><p>He caught sight of Julia\u2019s face, which was lined with distress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a jerk.\u201d</p><p>He continued tapping his foot under the table, an expression of discomfort.</p><p>\u201cI said some stupid stuff in the email I sent before you got married.

And to hear that the rumors are still swirling around you\u2014rumors that are his fault, not yours\u2014and that he\u2019s pressuring you to have a baby when you just started your program . . . Fuck.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhen is he going to wake up and realize that he married an incredible woman and that he needs to care for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does care for me. He isn\u2019t who you think he is.\u201d</p><p>Paul leveled his dark eyes at hers.</p><p>\u201cFor your sake, I hope not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe volunteers at the Italian Home for Children.

I\u2019m the one who\u2019s struggling. It\u2019s hard to withhold something from someone you love, knowing that it would make him happy. And I\u2019m happy, too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou recognized it yourself. I know he has his faults, but so do I. He\u2019d give me the world if he could fit it in his pocket, and he never, ever, lets me fall.\u201d</p><p>Paul looked away, his knee bouncing under the table.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Paul\u2019s paper was well received, if not a little short in Gabriel\u2019s estimation. He noted with grim satisfaction that both Paul and Julia appeared uneasy after their lunch, as if things hadn\u2019t gone quite as they\u2019d expected.</p><p>If Gabriel wanted to quiz Julia for details, he hid it well. He greeted her warmly when she returned, and they sat together during Paul\u2019s presentation.</p><p>Soon, it was Julia\u2019s turn. Professor Patel, one of the conference organizers, introduced her, dubbing her a rising star at Harvard. Gabriel\u2019s grin widened as he saw Christa seethe.</p> <p>The audience included fifty academics, in various stages of their careers. Professor Picton and Professor Marinelli sat in the front row near Gabriel. All three smiled at Julia encouragingly.</p><p>With uncertain fingers, she placed the pages of her paper on top of the lectern. In contrast with it, her petite form seemed even smaller. Professor Patel adjusted the microphone downward so that it would catch her voice.</p><p>She looked young and pale and nervous. Gabriel caught her chewing at the inside of her mouth and he silently willed her not to do so. He was grateful when she stopped.</p><p>With her eyes fixed on his, she took a deep breath and began.</p><p>\u201cThe title of my presentation is \u2018The Silence of St. Francis: A Witness to Fraud.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn canto twenty-seven of Dante\u2019s Inferno, Guido da Montefeltro tells the story of what happened after he died,</p><p>\u2018Francis came afterward, when I was dead,</p><p>For me; but one of the black Cherubim</p><p>Said to him: \u201cTake him not; do me no wrong;</p><p>He must come down among my servitors,</p><p>Because he gave the fraudulent advice</p><p>From which time forth I have been at his hair;</p><p>For who repents not cannot be absolved,</p><p>Nor can one both repent and will at once,</p><p>Because of the contradiction which consents not.\u201d</p><p>O miserable me ! how I did shudder</p><p>When he seized on me, saying: \u201cPeradventure</p><p>Thou didst not think that I was a logician!\u201d \u2019</p><p>\u201cGuido lived in Italy from about 1220 to 1298. He was a prominent Ghibelline and military strategist before retiring in order to become a Franciscan, around 1296. Afterward, Pope Boniface VIII persuaded him to give fraudulent counsel to the Colonna family, with whom he\u2019d been having trouble.</p><p>\u201cBoniface wanted Guido to promise the family amnesty if they would leave the security of their fortress. Guido did so, but only after he secured absolution. As a result of his counsel, the Colonna family left the fortress only to be punished by Boniface. Later, Guido died in the Franciscan monastery in Assisi.</p><p>\u201cGuido\u2019s account of what happened after his death is dramatic. We can envision St. Francis courageously confronting a demon in order to rescue the soul of his fellow Franciscan.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flickered to Gabriel\u2019s, which were a lively, expressive blue. A look passed between the two, and for an instant she knew they were both thinking of the ways they had rescued each other.</p><p>\u201cBut as is usual with Dante\u2019s writings, appearances can be deceiving. In life, Guido had a persuasive but deceptive tongue. In death, he inhabits the circle of the fraudulent. So his words should be treated with skepticism. Certainly, skepticism is warranted about Guido\u2019s claim that Francis came for his soul. If that was Francis\u2019s purpose, he failed.</p><p>\u201cNowhere else in The Divine Comedy do we witness evil overcoming goodness. The Comedy is so called because the narrative moves from disorder in Hell to order in Paradise. If one soul were to be punished unjustly, it would undermine the entire narrative. So a lot is at stake in this passage. Our interpretation of it has significance for the entire Comedy.\u201d</p><p>Julia paused and took a sip of water, her hand shaking slightly.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Dante, justice motivated God to create Hell. Virgil alludes to this when he explains that justice motivates the souls of the departed to pass over the river Acheron into Hell. Dante seems to take the view that those who inhabit Hell do so justly, because they merit their final destination. Souls aren\u2019t in Hell by accident or because of divine caprice. If that\u2019s the case, how do we interpret Guido\u2019s statements?\u201d</p><p>Katherine nodded, her eyes sparkling with pride. The movement caught Julia\u2019s attention, and a short look passed between the two women.</p><p>\u201cWith the understanding that Dante believes the souls that inhabit Hell do so justly, let\u2019s reconsider Guido\u2019s story. The demon sees Francis and shouts at him, saying that Guido\u2019s soul belongs in Hell and that it would be robbery for Francis to take it. If that\u2019s true, why would Francis appear?\u201d</p><p>Julia paused, hoping that the audience would join her in considering the question.</p><p>\u201cA survey of the literature in Dante studies for the past fifty years reveals at least two interpretations of this passage. First, that Guido is truthful and Francis appeared for his soul. Second, that Guido is lying and Francis didn\u2019t appear at all.</p><p>\u201cI believe that both possibilities are too extreme. For the first interpretation to be the correct, we\u2019d have to attribute either ignorance or injustice to Francis, neither of which is reasonable.</p><p>\u201cThe second interpretation asserts that Francis didn\u2019t appear, but then the demon\u2019s speech doesn\u2019t make sense, since Guido cannot steal his own soul. So we\u2019re left with a puzzling report of Francis\u2019s appearance, accompanied by an explanation that strains credulity. The explanation is given by Guido and a demon, neither of whom is trustworthy.</p><p>\u201cI believe we can solve the puzzle of Francis\u2019s appearance by rejecting Guido\u2019s explanation, and substituting one that would be consistent with Francis\u2019s life and character. According to my interpretation, Francis appeared and was seen by the demon. But the demon misunderstood why Francis was there.\u201d</p><p>Julia began to grip the lectern more tightly, as the members of the audience began to murmur. Her mouth felt dry as the desert, but she continued, her eyes locked on Gabriel\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMuch as it might be . . . comforting to think of Francis coming down from Heaven like an archangel to fight for Guido\u2019s soul, that can\u2019t be what happened.\u201d A look passed between the Emersons before Julia continued.</p><p>\u201cGuido capitalizes on Francis\u2019s well-known commitment to his brothers, no doubt thinking that reasonable people will believe that he appeared at the death of a fellow Franciscan. Further, Guido wants Dante to spread this tale, so others will think that he was important enough to merit the saint\u2019s attention, or that his condemnation to Hell was a mistake.</p><p>\u201cThe demon, thinking to persuade Francis not to rob him, explains why Guido deserves to be in Hell. Guido sought absolution for the sin of fraudulent counsel before he committed the sin. He believed absolution would free him from the consequences of his sin, and so he willingly and unrepentantly committed fraud against the Colonna family.</p><p>\u201cThe demon points out that absolution only works if the human being repents. You can\u2019t sin intentionally and be repentant of your sin at the same time.\u201d Julia gave the audience a tentative smile. \u201cAbsolution isn\u2019t like fire insurance.\u201d</p><p>(At this, a few members of the audience, including Paul, laughed.)</p><p>\u201cGuido cloaks himself in Franciscan robes and preemptive absolution, but he\u2019s a fraud. Francis would have known this. If anything, Guido shamed the Franciscans by behaving the way he did.</p><p>\u201cAlthough Francis could have condemned Guido\u2019s sin, he remains silent. He can\u2019t save Guido. He has to watch as the demon takes Guido by the hair and drags him down.</p><p>\u201cThe ugliness of the demon\u2019s shouting and Guido\u2019s false Franciscanism appear even worse when contrasted with Francis\u2019s quiet, pious presence. His silence and lack of action give the lie to the demon\u2019s explanation that Francis is there to steal. And his silence forces us to reexamine Guido\u2019s tale.</p><p>\u201cWould Francis have been so passive in trying to rescue a soul that was condemned unjustly? Of course not. But since Guido hasn\u2019t repented of his sin, all Francis can offer him is his silent compassion and, possibly, his prayers.\u201d</p><p>Julia paused and intentionally looked in Christa\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cFrancis could have argued with the demon. He could have called him a liar for presenting a false account of his appearance. He could have protested that the demon is simply gossiping about him. But instead of fighting to preserve his good name, Francis is quiet so that the evil can be heard for exactly what it is.\u201d</p><p>Julia shifted her gaze to the other conferencegoers, noting numerous nods of agreement and Paul\u2019s wide, expressive grin.</p><p>\u201cGuido would have us believe that St. Francis was either gullible enough to believe that Guido belonged in Heaven or arrogant enough to believe that he could second-guess God. Guido would have us believe that Francis confronted a demon but lost, because he wasn\u2019t smart enough to best the demon in a match of logic.</p><p>\u201cFrancis\u2019s life and his actions give the lie to those possibilities. In my view, he comes to the grave of Guido da Montefeltro to mourn him and his life of fraud, not to rescue him. In so doing, Francis manifests compassion and mercy, although it is a severe mercy.\u201d At this, Julia\u2019s eyes met her husband\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrancis was not a thief. He was not deceptive or fraudulent, and he made no attempt to use vain words to further his cause. If anything, Guido captured the essence of Francis\u2019s nature by describing him as being present but silent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s surprising, perhaps, that someone so skilled in fraud would be so adept at painting a picture of virtue. But when we reflect on the stories Francis\u2019s followers told about his life and works, we see that that\u2019s exactly what Guido does, even though he attempts to overshadow the picture with his skillful use of rhetoric.</p><p>\u201cIn conclusion, I think that the two historical interpretations of this passage are mistaken. Francis appeared at the death of Guido, but not to steal his soul.</p><p>\u201cFrancis\u2019s appearance contrasts true Franciscanism with the false Franciscanism of Guido da Montefeltro. If anything, Dante uses Guido as a foil to praise the piety of St. Francis by providing a stark contrast between the two men. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>Julia nodded at the audience as they offered her a respectable level of applause. She noticed several of the academics whispering to one another before her eyes found the faces of Professors Picton, Marinelli, and Emerson.</p><p>Gabriel winked, and her face broke into a relieved smile.</p><p>\u201cAre there any questions?\u201d Julia asked, turning to the audience.</p><p>There was a moment that in Julia\u2019s mind seemed to last forever, in which no one spoke. She found Christa\u2019s face and watched her conflicted expression, and believed that she had escaped unscathed.</p><p>Then, as if in slow motion, Christa\u2019s expression changed and hardened. She scrambled to her feet.</p> <p>Out of the corner of her eye, Julia saw Professor Pacciani take hold of Christa\u2019s elbow somewhat roughly, trying to pull her back into her seat. But Christa wrenched her arm free.</p><p>\u201cI have a question.\u201d</p><p>Julia bit her lip unconsciously, her heart leaping into her throat.</p><p>As if it had been choreographed, every member of the audience turned to look at Christa. Several conferencegoers whispered to their neighbors, their eyes alive with anticipation. Christa\u2019s conflict with the Emersons was well known now by almost every attendee. Indeed, the room began to buzz with a kind of nervous energy as everyone wondered what she was going to say.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many holes in your paper, I don\u2019t know where to begin. But let\u2019s start with your research, such as it is.\u201d Christa\u2019s tone was contemptuous. \u201cThe majority of papers on this passage accept the fact that Francis came for Guido. A few recent papers deny that Francis appeared. But no one\u201d\u2014she paused for emphasis\u2014\u201cno one thinks that Francis appeared but not for Guido\u2019s soul. Either Guido is lying or he isn\u2019t. It can\u2019t be half and half, like cream.\u201d</p><p>She smirked as a few members of the audience laughed.</p> <p>Julia swallowed hard, her eyes darting around the room, reading everyone\u2019s reaction before returning to Christa\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore, you don\u2019t even mention the beginning of canto twenty-seven, when Guido explains to Dante that he\u2019s telling the truth because he thinks that Dante will spend the rest of eternity in Hell and therefore won\u2019t be able to tell anyone what really happened. That passage demonstrates that Guido is telling the truth about Francis\u2019s appearance.</p><p>\u201cFinally, if you\u2019d bothered to read Professor Hutton\u2019s seminal work on the organization of the Inferno, you\u2019d know that he thought the demon\u2019s speech was reliable because his words were historically accurate. So Hutton thought that Francis appeared for Guido\u2019s soul, too.\u201d</p><p>With a proud smile, Christa sat down, waiting for Julia\u2019s response. She was so proud of herself, so self-satisfied, she missed the look that Professor Picton gave to Professor Pacciani. The look indicated very clearly that Katherine was holding Pacciani responsible for the flamboyant behavior of his guest, and that she was not pleased with that behavior. In response, Professor Pacciani whispered in Christa\u2019s ear, gesticulating wildly.</p><p>Julia simply stood there, blinking rapidly, while every single person in the room waited for her answer.</p><p>Gabriel moved forward in his chair, as if he were going to stand. He thought better of it, however, when Professor Picton narrowed her eyes at him. The expression on his face was thunderous as he glared in Christa\u2019s direction.</p><p>Paul muttered an expletive and folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>Professor Picton simply nodded at Julia, her face a picture of confidence.</p> <p>Julia raised a shaky hand to push her hair behind her ear, the diamonds in her engagement ring catching the light.</p><p>\u201cUm, let\u2019s begin with your point that some interpreters believe that Francis came for Guido\u2019s soul and that this can be shown by his opening lines to Dante.\u201d</p><p>Julia read the lines in Italian, her pronunciation sure and musical,</p><p>\u201c\u2018S\u2019i\u2019 credesse che mia risposta fosse</p><p>a persona che mai tornasse al mondo,</p><p>questa fiamma staria stanza pi\u00f9 scosse;</p><p>ma per\u00f2 che gi\u00e0 mai di questo fondo</p><p>non torno vivo alcun, s\u2019i\u2019 odo il vero,</p><p>sanza tema d\u2019infamia ti rispondo.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Julia began to stand a little taller.</p><p>\u201cIn this passage, Guido says he\u2019s willing to tell the truth since he believes that Dante is one of the damned and thus wouldn\u2019t be able to repeat the story. But Guido\u2019s tale is self-serving. He blames everyone\u2014the pope, the demon, and by implication, St. Francis\u2014for his fate. There\u2019s nothing in his account that he should be embarrassed about. If anything, the story he tells is one he would want to have repeated. He simply doesn\u2019t want to tip his hand by saying so, which is why he gives the speech I just quoted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also forgetting this line:</p><p>\u201c\u2018Ora chi se\u2019, ti priego che ne conte;</p><p>non esser duro pi\u00f9 ch\u2019altri sia stato,</p><p>se \u2018l nome tuo nel mondo tegna fronte.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Growing in confidence, Julia resisted the urge to smile, choosing rather to meet Christa\u2019s gaze gravely.</p><p>\u201cDante tells Guido that he intends to repeat his tale in the world. It\u2019s only after Dante says this that Guido recounts his life story. Also, we know that Dante doesn\u2019t resemble the other shades physically. So it\u2019s likely that Guido recognized that Dante wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>Christa began speaking, but Julia lifted a patient hand, indicating that she wasn\u2019t finished.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s textual evidence for my interpretation. There\u2019s a parallel passage in the fifth canto of Purgatorio, in which Guido\u2019s son talks about how an angel came for his soul at his death. Perhaps it\u2019s the responsibility of angels and not saints to ferry souls to Paradise. Thus, Francis appears at Guido\u2019s death for quite a different purpose.</p><p>\u201cAs for your last point, about Professor Hutton\u2019s work. If you\u2019re referring to Fire and Ice: Desire and Sin in Dante\u2019s Inferno, then your characterization of his position is incorrect. Although I don\u2019t have a copy of the book with me, there\u2019s a footnote in chapter ten in which he states that he believed that Francis appeared, because he thinks the words of the demon were directed at someone other than Guido, himself. But Professor Hutton says he has doubts as to whether Francis appeared for Guido\u2019s soul or for some other reason. That\u2019s all he says on the matter.\u201d</p><p>Christa stood up as if to argue, but before a word could exit her mouth, an aged professor dressed entirely in tweed turned around to face her. He looked at her contemptuously through his tortoiseshell glasses.</p><p>\u201cCan we move on? You\u2019ve asked your question and the speaker answered it. Adequately, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Christa was taken aback, but she quickly regrouped, protesting that she should have an opportunity to ask a supplementary question.</p><p>Once again, the audience reacted with whispered words, but Julia noticed that the expressions on their faces had changed. Now they were looking at Julia with a kind of muted appreciation.</p><p>\u201cCan we move on? I\u2019d like the opportunity to ask a question.\u201d The aged professor turned away from Christa and directed his gaze to the moderator, who stepped forward, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cAh, if there\u2019s time we\u2019ll come back to you, miss. But I believe Professor Wodehouse has the floor.\u201d</p><p>The aged man in tweed muttered a thank-you and stood up. He removed his glasses and waved them in Julia\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cDonald Wodehouse of Magdalen.\u201d He introduced himself.</p><p>Julia\u2019s face paled, for Professor Wodehouse was a Dante specialist whose standing rivaled that of Katherine Picton\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m familiar with the footnote you\u2019re referring to in Old Hut\u2019s book. You\u2019ve summarized it correctly. A different view is taken by Emerson in his volume.\u201d At this, Wodehouse gestured in Gabriel\u2019s direction. \u201cBut I see you haven\u2019t been swayed by him, despite the fact that you two share a last name.\u201d</p><p>Laughter erupted from the crowd, and Gabriel winked at Julia proudly.</p><p>\u201cAs you point out, it\u2019s perplexing to see why Francis would appear at the death of a false Franciscan, but we need to posit Francis\u2019s appearance in order to make sense of the demon\u2019s speech. So we\u2019re left with half-and-half as the woman behind me mentioned. I don\u2019t find that problematic. Half-truth, half-falsity seems to pervade all of Guido\u2019s words. The ambiguity and rhetorical sophistry is what one would expect in a person guilty of fraudulent counsel. So I tend to agree with much of what you\u2019ve said, and although I can\u2019t speak for him, I surmise that Old Hut would too, if he were here.\u201d</p><p>Julia exhaled slowly in relief, her fingers loosening their iron grip on the lectern. Her mind was bracing for his next words, but she felt vindicated by the professor\u2019s remarks.</p><p>Professor Wodehouse glanced at his handwritten notes before continuing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve provided an interpretation that\u2019s certainly as good a theory as any, and better than those accounts that would attribute ignorance or injustice to Francis. But let\u2019s be clear. It\u2019s speculation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice was low but determined. \u201cI\u2019d welcome suggestions of alternative interpretations.\u201d</p><p>Professor Wodehouse shrugged. \u201cWho knows why Francis did anything? Perhaps he was supposed to meet another soul in Assisi and was merely waylaid by an opportunistic fraud.\u201d</p><p>At this, the audience laughed.</p><p>\u201cI do, however, have a question.\u201d He replaced his glasses on his face and looked down at his notes. \u201cI\u2019d like you to say more about the agreement that existed between Boniface and Guido. You rather glossed over that part in your paper, and I think the matter merits more attention.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he sat down.</p><p>Julia nodded, frantically trying to gather her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cMy thesis was on the interpretation of Francis\u2019s appearance, not Guido\u2019s sin. Nevertheless, I\u2019m happy to expand on that part of the paper.\u201d</p><p>Julia began a short but fluid summary of Guido\u2019s encounter with Pope Boniface VIII and its aftermath, which seemed to satisfy the professor. However, she mentally made note of the fact that he\u2019d thought her paper lacking in that respect. She\u2019d attend to his worry in her revision of the paper for potential publication. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few more questions were asked and answered, and then the moderator thanked Julia. A round of applause that bordered on the enthusiastic filled the room, and Julia noticed several older professors nodding at her.</p><p>When the moderator invited everyone to pause for tea and coffee, Julia watched in surprise as Professor Pacciani took Christa by the hand and led her away.</p><p>Julia walked over to Gabriel, eagerly searching his face.</p><p>He smiled and linked their pinky fingers surreptitiously.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my smart girl,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Julia made the rounds during the coffee break, speaking to Professor Wodehouse and others about her paper. It was almost universally acknowledged that her research was very good and that she\u2019d handled the questions admirably. In fact, more than one conferencegoer remarked that they were surprised she was only a graduate student and not a junior professor.</p><p>While his wife enjoyed her academic triumph, Gabriel strolled outside, sipping his coffee in the Oxford sunshine.</p><p>He was grateful for the fine weather and lack of rain. He was also grateful that Julia\u2019s presentation had gone so well. Yes, she\u2019d appeared nervous, and as always, there was room for improvement. But given her status as a doctoral freshman, many of the attendees had been duly impressed. He silently offered a prayer of thanks.</p> <p>Midprayer, Paul Norris approached him, his hands jammed into his pockets.</p><p>They made patient, polite small talk at first. Then Gabriel noticed that Paul was regarding him with something akin to agitation.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice was deceptively soft. Soft like Scotch.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Paul removed his hands from his pockets. He was about to reenter the college when he stopped.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>He squared his shoulders, facing his former dissertation director.</p> <p>\u201cProfessor Picton would like you to be an external reader on my dissertation.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel regarded Paul coolly. \u201cYes, she mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>Paul waited for the Professor to continue, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cUh, is that something you\u2019d consider?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rocked back on his heels. \u201cI\u2019ll consider it. Your dissertation topic is good and I was satisfied with the work that you did for me. I passed you to Katherine for personal reasons, otherwise, I\u2019d still be directing your dissertation.\u201d</p><p>Paul looked away uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cJulia did well.\u201d He changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cYes, she did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe even handled Christa.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face wore a look of pride. \u201cJulianne is a remarkable woman. She\u2019s much stronger than she looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Paul\u2019s eyes hardened into what could have been a glare.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed to have a lot to say to and about my wife.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s tone grew progressively cooler.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to put a stop to the rumors? I was out at UCLA in March and people were talking about how Julia boinked you in order to graduate and get into Harvard.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jumped in Gabriel\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cThose rumors are the fruits of Miss Peterson\u2019s poisonous tree. She will be dealt with, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you need to step it up.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>Paul shifted his weight, but he would not be deterred.</p><p>\u201cWhen I arrived yesterday, I overheard a couple of the old folks talking about Julia. They assumed she was a bimbo and that\u2019s why she was on the program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say she proved them wrong. Julianne\u2019s paper was well presented and well received. There\u2019s also the little matter that rather than simply boinking her\u201d\u2014at this, Gabriel waved his hand distastefully\u2014\u201cI married her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may be your wife, but you don\u2019t deserve her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel took a menacing step closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Paul drew himself to his full height, which was an inch taller than his former professor.</p><p>\u201cI said you don\u2019t deserve her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel threw his china coffee cup in frustration. It smashed on the pavement.</p><p>\u201cEvery night when I fall asleep with her in my arms, I thank God she\u2019s mine. Every morning when I wake up, my first thought is that I\u2019m grateful she married me. I will never be worthy of her. But I spend every day trying my damnedest. You were her friend when she needed one. But listen to me when I tell you, Paul, you do not want to push me.\u201d</p><p>A long silence passed between them. Gabriel held on to his temper as the result of a Herculean effort.</p><p>Paul was the first to look away.</p><p>\u201cWhen I first met her, she was so jumpy. I felt like I had to whisper just so I wouldn\u2019t scare her. She isn\u2019t like that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Paul hunched his shoulders. \u201cShe was telling me about her program at Harvard over lunch. She loves it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s expression grew even darker. \u201cAnd I know you want her. I\u2019m telling you, you can\u2019t have her.\u201d</p><p>Paul met his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d The Professor challenged him, taking a step forward. They were now mere inches apart, the Professor\u2019s posture angry and threatening.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t just want her. I love her. She\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stared at him incredulously. \u201cShe can\u2019t be the one. She\u2019s my wife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Paul looked over the Professor\u2019s shoulder at Woodstock Road, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI met a pretty, sweet, Catholic girl. The kind of woman I could introduce to my parents. The kind of woman I\u2019ve been looking for my whole life. I treated her right, we became friends, and when an asshole came along and broke her heart, I was there. She cried on my fucking shoulder. She fell asleep on my fucking couch.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel snapped his jaw shut furiously.</p><p>\u201cThe semester ended and she followed her dream to Harvard. I helped her move. I found her a part-time job and an apartment. But when I finally told her how I felt, when I finally asked her to choose me, she couldn\u2019t. Not because she didn\u2019t care about me, or didn\u2019t feel anything. But because she was in love with the asshole who broke her heart.\u201d</p><p>Paul laughed without amusement.</p><p>\u201cAnd this guy, he\u2019s bad news. He fucks around. He treats her like dirt. He drinks too much. For all I know, he seduced her for kicks. He was involved with a professor who hits on her students and is into BDSM. So who knows what he does to my girl behind closed doors? When he leaves her, I\u2019m ecstatic, thinking now she has a chance to be with someone who\u2019ll be good to her. Someone who\u2019ll be gentle with her and never, ever make her cry. Then, to my fucking astonishment, the asshole comes back. He fucking returns. And what does he do? He asks her to marry him. And she accepts!\u201d</p><p>He kicked at the pavement in frustration.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my life, in a fucking nutshell. Find the perfect girl, lose the perfect girl to an asshole who broke her heart and will probably break it again and again. And then get a fucking invitation to their big-ass wedding in Italy.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel ground his teeth together. \u201cIn the first place, she is not your girl and she never was. I don\u2019t have to justify myself to you or to anyone else. But out of respect for my wife, who seems to care about you, I\u2019ll admit I was an asshole. I\u2019m not that man anymore. I never fucked around on her, not even once, and I\u2019m sure as hell not going to break her heart again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Paul shuffled his feet. \u201cThen let her finish her program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice dropped to a near-whisper. \u201cLet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might decide to give up or take time off or something. Encourage her to continue.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cIf you have information you want to share, Mr. Norris, I suggest you spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia feels guilty about making her grad program such a high priority.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled as the import of Paul\u2019s words became clear.</p><p>\u201cShe told you this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also said that she doesn\u2019t have any friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow convenient for you. Are you interested in continuing to be her friend?\u201d</p><p>Paul grimaced. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fucking convenient. Don\u2019t you get it? I love her and because I love her, I have to listen to her worry about making you happy. You, the asshole who left her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly happy she chose to confide in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she had friends in Cambridge, she wouldn\u2019t need to. And anyway, my friendship with her has to end.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rocked on his heels, momentarily taken aback.</p><p>\u201cDid you come to this decision yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to her before her lecture. That would be cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you planning to tell her?\u201d</p><p>Paul sighed deeply. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I can\u2019t say it to her face. When I get back to Vermont I\u2019ll write to her.\u201d He gave Gabriel a resentful look. \u201cI\u2019m sure that will make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take pleasure in her suffering, despite what you think.\u201d Gabriel looked down at the platinum band on his left hand. \u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s dark eyes shifted to the wedding ring.</p><p>The Professor continued, \u201cYour friendship is important to her. She\u2019ll be hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell her that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s going to kill me to tell her the truth, but I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very noble.\u201d An admiring tone crept into Gabriel\u2019s voice. \u201cPerhaps I should persuade you to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A long look passed between Paul and his former professor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve misjudged you, Paul. And for that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this for you. I\u2019m sure as hell not doing this so you\u2019ll read my dissertation and write me a recommendation letter. I\u2019ll tell Katherine that I spoke to you and you declined.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded at Gabriel and began to walk toward the college.</p><p>\u201cMr. Norris,\u201d Gabriel called.</p><p>He stopped and slowly moved to face the Professor.</p><p>\u201cI always intended to be an external reader, whether you continued your friendship with Julianne or not. Your research stands on its own merits.\u201d He extended his hand.</p><p>Paul considered this for a moment, then strode toward him. They shook hands.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>A look passed between the two men that was reminiscent of the look that warriors gave after a battle in which both sides took heavy losses.</p><p>Paul was the first to speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to interfere in your marriage. But if I learn that you\u2019ve broken her heart again, we\u2019re going to have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I break Julianne\u2019s heart, I\u2019ll deserve it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d Paul grinned. \u201cCan we stop touching each other now?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel dropped his hand as if it were on fire. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Later that afternoon, Julia and Gabriel checked into the Randolph Hotel. They were supposed to meet Katherine and Paul for dinner. But Paul said that he needed to speak to Professor Picton alone and, apologizing, asked the Emersons if they\u2019d mind canceling their dinner plans. So the Emersons were left to dine alone.</p> <p>After a quiet meal in the Randolph\u2019s elegant dining room, they went upstairs to their suite.</p><p>\u201cAre you glad the conference is over?\u201d Gabriel held the door open for his wife.</p><p>\u201cVery glad.\u201d Immediately, Julia took off her suit jacket, draping it over a chair. She sat on the edge of the bed and kicked off her high heels.</p><p>She retrieved a square of chocolate from atop one of the pillows and unwrapped it, popping the sweet into her mouth. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give us chocolates at Magdalen College.\u201d</p><p>She gazed fondly in the direction of the en-suite. \u201c\u2019I\u2019m kind of in love with the heated towel rack in the bathroom. We need one of those in Cambridge.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t trade our nights at Magdalen for anything. If we come back to Oxford, I hope we can stay there again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cMagdalen is a special place, but the accommodations are a bit Spartan for my tastes. I think if we split our time between here and there, we\u2019d be doing well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had hoped I\u2019d see a Narnian ghost during our visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t find one outside Magdalen. Although I\u2019m told that the actor who played Inspector Morse haunts the bar downstairs. We could go and take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough of people for one day. I need a hot bath, a hot towel, and an early night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you feel differently now?\u201d He extended his hand to cup her cheek.</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout grad school.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAbout anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked hard on the paper, but I was also lucky. The audience didn\u2019t bring their pitchforks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t pushovers. I know that crowd. They don\u2019t suffer fools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed that based on the way they turned on Christa during the question period. I\u2019ve never seen that happen before.\u201d Julia shuddered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it. And worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder where she went.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel snorted. \u201cApparently, Pacciani escorted her from the building. I suppose Katherine really did put the fear of God in him. He was furious.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked up at her husband curiously. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange that Paul didn\u2019t want to have dinner with us? He seemed to be looking forward to it earlier.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel traced a light finger down her nose. \u201cMaybe Katherine isn\u2019t happy with his dissertation and he wanted to smooth things over without an audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question. Do you feel differently about grad school now? Or are you still enthusiastic about your program?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand over his, pressing his palm against her cheek. \u201cIt was an intimidating experience. But I\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019d like to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I think you\u2019re gifted, Julianne, and I want to do everything in my power to help you succeed.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes tightly. \u201cThank you, Gabriel. That means a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can always talk to me. If something is troubling you, I\u2019ll listen. I promise.\u201d He slid his hand to the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI just want us to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that too. So if you\u2019re ever unhappy, tell me.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips to his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what Beatrice\u2019s husband thought of Dante\u2019s attentions. You have to admit, that part of the story is sad. Beatrice is married, but she has this poet following her around and writing sonnets about her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s grip on her tightened. \u201cI married you. I love you. We have what Dante and Beatrice never had.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cI need to go out. But I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be gone long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But in the meantime, I have a gift.\u201d He pulled a box out of his pocket and placed it in her hand.</p><p>Julia read the label. Cartier.</p><p>She looked up at him wide-eyed.</p><p>He opened the box and she saw a beautiful white gold watch shining against folds of creamy silk.</p><p>\u201cThis is in recognition of a job well done. You\u2019re going to have lots of opportunities to present your research, and you need a reliable watch.\u201d</p><p>He removed it from the box and turned it over, showing her the inscription on the back.</p><p>To My Beloved,</p><p>With admiration and pride</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>\u201cA Timex is a reliable watch. This is something else entirely.\u201d Julia almost laughed.</p><p>\u201cSomething entirely deserved, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>She touched the engraving in awe.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I know what?\u201d He clasped the watch around her wrist. It fit perfectly.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I\u2019d do a good job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have faith in you.\u201d He kissed her slowly. Then, with a determined look, he exited their suite.</p><p>Christa Peterson sat on the large bed in her hotel room, waiting. She\u2019d managed to find a sexy black basque that laced up the back, and she wore it with gartered stockings and very high heels.</p><p>Champagne cooled in a silver container in the corner, provocative music floated through the air, and a series of sensual accessories (including handcuffs) lay on the table next to the bed.</p><p>She checked the very expensive watch she\u2019d worn since she\u2019d lost her virginity, resisting the urge to think back to the words Giuseppe had said to her the night before. His ascription had been too close to the mark.</p><p>Instead, she focused on what was about to happen. She was finally going to have her heart\u2019s desire\u2014Professor Gabriel O. Emerson in her arms, her bed, her body.</p><p>At last.</p><p>Men never said no to her. And despite Gabriel\u2019s attachment to his plain and mousy little wife, he was a man. They\u2019d fuck a few times and go their separate ways. She\u2019d have the satisfaction of knowing her success rate at seduction was one hundred percent.</p><p>A knock echoed through the room.</p><p>Trying to hide her enthusiasm, Christa straightened the seams of her stockings and walked toward the door.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>You were wonderful,\u201d Gabriel whispered, lazily running the backs of his fingers up and down her spine.</p><p>She hugged the pillow, hiding her face. She was lying on her stomach, her back gloriously exposed.</p><p>He eyed her bashfulness with concern before leaning over to kiss the slope of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDarling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Julia shifted a little, her eyes meeting his.</p><p>\u201cHow did you feel about that position?\u201d Gabriel pressed his palm flat just above her backside, resting over two dimples.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo qualifications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you shy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>Gabriel rolled her to her side. \u201cYou\u2019re safe. I promise, you\u2019re safe in my arms and in my bed. Always.\u201d</p><p>He placed a finger to her chin, lifting it.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>She avoided his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bring old issues up, but sometimes I worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry I\u2019m not adventurous enough for you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel would have laughed had she not looked so serious. He forced himself to look grave.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a remarkable worry after the past few hours.\u201d His palm rested on the curve of her backside, but he resisted the urge to squeeze.</p><p>She blew a lock of hair away from her mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to tell you this, but Christa cornered me just before lunch.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that name while we\u2019re in bed.\u201d</p><p>Julia nuzzled against the fine hair of his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you deserved someone adventurous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her poisonous bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her you deserved love and that\u2019s what I gave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly true.\u201d His hand slid up her spine to her neck, where he began massaging her gently. \u201cSo why are you worrying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to keep you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel chuckled in spite of himself. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re in a competition, then, darling, because I want to do my damnedest to keep you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She snuggled closer in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThere are some adventures I experienced before you that I don\u2019t wish to repeat.\u201d</p><p>Julia thought of Professor Pain and winced.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s index finger traced the curve of her neck, up and down and up and down, whisper soft. \u201cOther adventures I\u2019d be willing to explore, if you felt the same way. Our bed is for pleasure. My utmost concern is to please you and to find my pleasure with you, not at your expense. You don\u2019t need to worry that I\u2019ll abandon you if you say no to me. You can always say no. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She breathed deeply.</p><p>\u201cSo if I were to suggest something . . . new, and you were to decide you didn\u2019t want to try it, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her large eyes searched his.</p><p>The edges of his lips turned up. \u201cI might attempt to seduce you and change your mind. But I can think of few things more unpleasant than bedding an unwilling woman.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his thumb across the curve of her cheek.</p><p>\u201cAnd in your case, I can think of nothing more painful than looking into your eyes and seeing discomfort or regret.\u201d</p><p>He brought their mouths together and they were both momentarily lost in the sweetness of their embrace.</p><p>\u201cDo you still feel shy?\u201d He pulled back so he could see her expression.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pressed her legs together. \u201cBut I\u2019m wondering what kind of sexual adventures you have in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Julianne, and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He rolled her to her back before pinning her arms above her head and whispering his lips against her throat.</p><p>The next morning, the Emersons slept late despite their intention to awake early and visit the Ashmolean Museum. Gabriel left the bed first, kissing Julia before walking to the en-suite.</p><p>After he\u2019d showered and shaved, he entered the bedroom, clad only in his glasses and a towel. Julia was still asleep.</p><p>He gazed on her with no little satisfaction. She\u2019d been absolutely shattered the night before, the result of an exceptional series of orgasms. His chest swelled with pride.</p><p>For Gabriel, it had been a night spent initiating her into activities she\u2019d never done before. He couldn\u2019t help the primal possessiveness he felt at being the one to teach her\u2014at being the one to share her pleasure. But his possessiveness was tempered with tenderness, as he recognized how much Julia had come to trust him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their couplings were always passionate, always loving. Gabriel watched her relentlessly when they were together, so that any sign of hesitation was immediately addressed. And knowing that she was safe in his bed, she gave herself freely.</p><p>Sex could be all-consuming. He knew this and had once been consumed, caught like an animal in a trap. He knew that even with his wife, there were times when he felt the temptation to push everything aside so he could find himself inside her.</p><p>Julia could be voracious and passionate. Her confidence in her safety made her brave, and her passion for him made her an enthusiastic lover. Her experience was limited to what he\u2019d taught her, a fact in which he took no little pride. It seemed as if every sexual act between them was fraught with newness.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to communicate his feelings on these matters to her, without bringing up the specter of his past. But he felt the differences among his wife and his lovers in his very flesh and tried to reassure her of how much she pleased him in word as well as deed.</p> <p>Within the bedroom as without, they followed the wisdom of St. Augustine: Love and do what you will.</p><p>(They\u2019d loved and willed several times the night before.)</p><p>He eyed the remnants of his surprise\u2014strawberries and truffles for both of them, champagne for Julia and sparkling water for him. The concierge had been very obliging when he\u2019d appeared at his desk on impulse the night before.</p><p>Gabriel began picking up the clothes they\u2019d discarded. He hung up her things first, smiling at the corset and minuscule panties she\u2019d worn underneath her conservative suit. She knew just how to tantalize him, without losing any of her innate modesty.</p><p>He hung up his own suit, emptying his pockets as he did so. Something white fluttered to the ground.</p> <p>He bent over to retrieve it. It was a business card with printed lettering.</p><p>Christa Peterson, M.A.</p><p>Graduate Student</p><p>Department of Italian</p><p>Columbia University</p><p>Email:</p> <p>[email protected]</p><p>Tel. (212) 458-2124</p><p>Gabriel stared in disgust at the item, turning it over. On the back of the card he found writing, in a sloping woman\u2019s hand,</p><p>Malmaison Hotel, Room 209.</p><p>Tonight.</p><p>With a curse, Gabriel crumpled the card and threw it into the wastepaper basket.</p><p>Christa must have slipped it in his pocket the day before. No doubt she\u2019d written on the card before she saw him, having planned her seduction in advance. Perhaps she\u2019d even traveled to Oxford solely for that purpose.</p><p>Given that explanation, much of her behavior made sense. Gabriel was the mark, not Julia. Christa\u2019s outrageous actions were carefully calculated to entrap him, capitalizing on his desire to protect his wife. Of course, that didn\u2019t stop Christa from taunting Julia and suggesting she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on to her husband, as if Christa knew her seduction would be successful.</p> <p>His stomach lurched.</p><p>Gabriel walked to the bed, looking at Julia\u2019s face in profile as she slept. They\u2019d enjoyed an evening of tremendous pleasure, and Christa wished to take that away from them. Her lust had turned into envy and treachery as she conspired to become an adulterer and steal him from his wife.</p><p>It\u2019s a good thing Julia didn\u2019t find that card.</p><p>Hopefully, she would have confronted him about it and not gone and bared her soul to Paul.</p><p>A tremor traveled up and down Gabriel\u2019s spine. Julianne\u2019s budding career was precious. His marriage was precious. And he wasn\u2019t about to let anyone or anything threaten either.</p><p>Picking up his cell phone, he strode back to the bathroom, dialing the number for John Green, his lawyer.</p><p>In the Malmaison Hotel in Oxford Castle, Christa stood in front of the bathroom mirror. She raised a shaking hand to her lip, ghosting over where the skin was split. She winced, slowly inspecting the bruise that was blossoming in her cheek and the marks where his fingers had dug into her flesh.</p><p>She looked terrible.</p><p>She\u2019d opened the door to her room the night before, expecting to see Professor Emerson. Instead, Giuseppe was standing there, drunk and furious.</p><p>He\u2019d pushed past her and locked the door, ranting about how she was going to cost him an academic position in America. His rants were slurred and in Italian.</p><p>When she questioned him, he grew even more belligerent, demanding to know whom she was attempting to seduce in the hotel room he\u2019d paid for.</p><p>As soon as she said Gabriel\u2019s name, he\u2019d backhanded her.</p><p>She\u2019d never been struck before. There were a lot of things she\u2019d never experienced before last night and this morning. She looked down between her legs where the flesh was tender and raw. She hadn\u2019t consented. She hadn\u2019t consented to any of it.</p><p>Giuseppe\u2019s previous tenderness had disappeared entirely. He\u2019d been in a rage, ripping the fabric from her body and forcing her to the bed. He\u2019d called her names, cursing her and Gabriel, and when she struggled, he\u2019d struck her again.</p><p>She stumbled to the toilet as she recalled the assault, emptying the contents of her stomach. When she was finished, she leaned against the counter and drank a glass of water.</p><p>She thought she was in control. She decided whom to fuck and what they must give her in return. She was the one who spurned lovers. But last night the control had been taken away from her.</p><p>He\u2019d taken more than that. She fought angry, frustrated tears at the memory.</p><p>She crept back to the bedroom to make sure that he was still sleeping. When she heard the low sound of his snores, she knew it was time.</p><p>Hastily, she pulled on some clothes, not caring if the colors or styles matched. She tossed her belongings in her suitcase, leaving the torn remnants of last night\u2019s lingerie on the floor.</p><p>She heard a loud intake of breath coming from the bed and spun around, terrified.</p><p>Giuseppe muttered something and his snoring recommenced.</p><p>Christa located her purse and her passport and grabbed them, along with her coat. She was almost to the door when she realized that her Baume &amp; Mercier watch was sitting on the nightstand. It was mere inches from his head.</p><p>She wanted to retrieve it. The watch was very valuable, for sentimental reasons.</p><p>As she approached the bed, Pacciani\u2019s breathing grew more uneven. A groan escaped his mouth and he rolled toward her.</p><p>Without looking back, she fled to the door, opening and closing it quietly.</p><p>She left the watch behind.</p><p>As she entered the taxi that would whisk her to the railway station, she began plotting her revenge. All thoughts of Professor Gabriel O. Emerson and his young wife, Julianne, fled from her mind.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t attend your graduation in Toronto.\u201d Gabriel held Julia\u2019s hand as they explored the Ashmolean Museum, which was across the street from the Randolph Hotel.</p><p>\u201cI searched for you. I was so sure you\u2019d be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be in the same room as you and not go to you. To do that in front of Jeremy and Dean Aras . . .\u201d Gabriel shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll go to your next graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to press their lips together. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They continued walking through the museum, stopping to admire some of the items on display. When they stopped in front of a panel that displayed a medieval painting of St. Lucy, Julia was reminded of Rachel.</p><p>\u201cYour sister sent me an email. She asked how my paper went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say. If she isn\u2019t, it\u2019s not for lack of trying.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wrinkled his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t need that kind of image.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Rachel doesn\u2019t need that kind of image of you, either. But she was almost as happy as me when we consummated our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that hard to believe,\u201d he whispered, pulling her into his arms in a dark corner.</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019s looking forward to visiting us in Cambridge Labor Day weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet, now. I\u2019m trying to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. \u201cJust a minute. I\u2019m not done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry up,\u201d he pouted, bringing his lips to within an inch of hers.</p><p>\u201cThis is important.\u201d She gave him a scolding look. \u201cRachel and Aaron would like us to light a candle for them in Assisi. They want us to pray that they\u2019ll have a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Richard\u2019s prayers would be more efficacious than mine. Although I\u2019m still praying for one more thing.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel couldn\u2019t hide the brightness of hope that shone in his eyes, as if his unanswered prayer were a treasure that he desperately desired.</p><p>Julia noted the change but said nothing. She\u2019d just celebrated her triumphal coming out into academic society the day before. Now Gabriel was hinting at having a child. Somehow the hope in his eyes made her discomfort all the more painful.</p><p>The light in his eyes dimmed.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d He released her from his arms.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re repulsed by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not repulsed.\u201d She forced a smile.</p><p>\u201cIs the thought of having a child with me so repulsive?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s features hardened.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d She wound their fingers together. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to think about children when I\u2019d rather focus on conference presentations and grad school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t an either-or proposition, Julianne. I\u2019d never make you sacrifice your dreams. I think I\u2019ve demonstrated that ably enough.\u201d His voice was glacial.</p><p>\u201cAs you may recall, your sacrifice caused us both a great deal of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d He released her hand and gestured to the hallway. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel.\u201d She placed a light hand on his arm. \u201cI told you before we were married that the thought of having little blue-eyed boys with you made me happy. It still does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t we talk about it? God, Julianne. If we were going to go to Africa, we\u2019d talk about it. If we were going to build a house, we\u2019d talk about it. Why can\u2019t we talk about having a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t say no to you, not when you look so happy and hopeful.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI can\u2019t bear to be the one standing between you and your dreams, like a coldhearted wench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d he murmured, sweeping her into a tight embrace. \u201cNothing could be further from my mind.\u201d</p><p>His hand found the skin of her neck, underneath her hair, and he stroked it tenderly.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the best place to have this conversation, but I promise I don\u2019t think of you that way. I told you I\u2019d wait. I understand you want to finish your program. Watching you yesterday, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve been more proud of you. You were fantastic.\u201d He pressed his lips to just below her ear. \u201cWhen I bring up the subject of a family, I swear I\u2019m not trying to pressure you. I\u2019m simply bringing up a topic that makes me happy, hoping that it will make you happy too. We can talk about the future and make plans without changing our time line. Starting a family is a momentous decision, especially given our backgrounds. I know that you\u2019ve given the matter some thought. I\u2019m simply asking that we talk about it. But we certainly don\u2019t need to talk about it now. I\u2019m sorry for bringing it up on the heels of your lecture. Just promise me we\u2019ll talk about it someday, even if it\u2019s in the most general of terms.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course, Gabriel. It\u2019s just that the topic makes me anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I need to do a better job of bringing up the subject and not springing it on you. But I don\u2019t want to hear you refer to yourself as either coldhearted or a wench ever again.\u201d He pulled back to make eye contact with her. \u201cNeither of those ascriptions applies to you, and I certainly won\u2019t have anyone speak about my wife that way.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He took her hand and began walking. \u201cNow, as I recall, you were telling me about Rachel\u2019s email.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer exact words were, \u2018I\u2019m calling in all my chips. I\u2019ve got Christians, Muslims, Jews, and even a Zoroastrian praying.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked puzzled. \u201cRachel knows a Zoroastrian? How is that possible? There are less than two hundred thousand Zoroastrians worldwide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe works with a woman who\u2019s Zoroastrian. How do you know how many Zoroastrians there are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI Wikied it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gazed at her solemnly before giving her a sly wink.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe anything you read on Wikipedia, Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have said it better myself, Mrs. Emerson. Someone wrote an entry about me on that damned site, and the content was shocking. Wikifuckers.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her gently but firmly before they heard someone nearby clearing his throat.</p><p>A security guard stood two feet away.</p><p>\u201cMove along.\u201d He glared at them.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Gabriel sounded far from apologetic as he wound his arm around Julia\u2019s waist and ducked into an adjacent room.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be more discreet.\u201d She felt flushed as they continued their tour.</p><p>\u201cWe need to find a darker corner.\u201d Gabriel gazed at her provocatively, and she felt her flush deepen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked John Green to send Christa a cease-and-desist letter.\u201d Gabriel led her into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn did. It\u2019s a shot across the bow. We\u2019re simply reminding her that we won\u2019t tolerate slander. The woman is a menace.\u201d</p><p>Julia took a deep breath and held it before exhaling slowly. \u201cThe conference went better than expected.\u201d</p><p>He brought her hand to his lips. \u201cYou were exceptional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo maybe the slander isn\u2019t as worrisome as we thought.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSlander is always worrisome. Don\u2019t you know that line from Othello:</p><p>\u201c\u2018Who steals my purse steals trash. . . .</p><p>But he that filches from me my good name</p><p>Robs me of that which not enriches him</p><p>And makes me poor indeed.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall hearing you quote that before. But can you really stop Christa from gossiping about us?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked at her in resignation. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But given her behavior at the conference, I had to try.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>July 2011</p><p>Minneapolis, Minnesota</p><p>Paulina Gruscheva\u2019s handwriting was bold and sophisticated, like the woman herself. She wrote with a Montblanc fountain pen, the black ink flowing in curved flourishes over the expensive cream-colored envelope.</p><p>She\u2019d had to look up his address. Miraculously, he was in the Cambridge telephone book.</p><p>As she peered down at the letters and numbers she\u2019d written, a smile of satisfaction spread across her beautiful features. Then she sealed the envelope and readied herself to take it to the post office.</p><p>He was going to be surprised.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>July 2011</p><p>Italy</p><p>Julia and Gabriel said good-bye to Katherine, Paul, and Oxford a few days after the conference. The last words exchanged with Paul were especially awkward. Julia knew her friend and consequently knew that something was wrong. But when she asked him about it, he merely referenced his anxiety over his dissertation.</p><p>When he hugged her good-bye, he held her tightly and a little too long. Julia said they\u2019d stay in touch, and he nodded but didn\u2019t agree. She excused his behavior by telling herself that he was simply being nostalgic about their friendship.</p><p>Gabriel distracted Katherine from noticing Paul\u2019s exchange with Julia, trying to give them some privacy. He took no pleasure in seeing Paul\u2019s discomfort, or the way he tried to appear happy and at ease for Julia\u2019s sake.</p><p>The Emersons traveled to Rome, celebrating Gabriel\u2019s birthday on the seventeenth of July with a special tour of the Vatican Museum. There was, however, a shocking lack of museum sex.</p><p>(Not even Gabriel was tempted to indulge himself with Julia inside the Vatican.)</p><p>They visited Assisi for a few days, where they prayed and lit candles at the crypt of St. Francis. Although Gabriel and Julia didn\u2019t confess the content of their prayers, it was understood that they prayed for each other, for their marriage, and for the eventual gift of a child.</p><p>To these prayers, Julia added her own requests for wisdom and strength, while Gabriel asked for goodness and courage. Both of them prayed for Rachel and Aaron, asking that God would bless their attempts to have a baby.</p><p>So it was that they arrived at their house near Todi, an Umbrian village, at the end of July. The house was located near a mixed fruit tree orchard and boasted an enclosed pool that was bordered on one edge by lavender. The fragrant flowers perfumed the air, and Julia placed a few sprigs between the sheets of their bed.</p><p>When she awoke the next day, Gabriel was gone. With the sun high in the sky and shining in through the balcony windows she was not surprised by his absence, or by the coolness of the sheets on his side. Clutching his pillow, which still retained the scent of Aramis mingled with lavender, she found a handwritten note.</p><p>Good Morning, Darling.</p><p>You were sleeping too peacefully to awaken.</p><p>I\u2019ve gone into Todi to pick up a few things from the market.</p><p>Call my cell phone if you need anything.</p><p>Love,</p><p>G.</p><p>PS. You\u2019re breathtaking.</p><p>Julia smiled. It was a simple note, not unlike countless others he\u2019d written for her. But in the bottom corner, almost as an afterthought, he\u2019d sketched her. It was her profile while she slept, transposed into a small pencil drawing. Underneath it he\u2019d written My Beatrice.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known that he had skill with a pencil, although his dexterity in other respects suggested a multiplicity of manual talents. The sketch was quite good. She wanted to frame it.</p><p>Still smiling, she swung her naked feet to the floor and walked gingerly to the closet. She didn\u2019t feel like wearing clothes. So she took one of Gabriel\u2019s dress shirts and put it on, buttoning only a few of the buttons before searching one of the dresser drawers for some socks.</p><p>From downstairs, she heard Gabriel\u2019s voice calling. Enthusiastically, she sped down the stairs and toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d He kissed her forehead as he set the groceries on the counter. \u201dYou look pretty.\u201d</p><p>Hands free, he pecked first one cheek then the other before trapping her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d His lips moved against her hair.</p><p>\u201cVery well. Between our stay in Assisi and last night, I think I\u2019ve slept more than in months.\u201d She pressed her mouth to his Adam\u2019s apple, and he recoiled slightly as if she\u2019d tickled him. \u201cThank you for the drawing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could draw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, I\u2019d paint you if I could. With my fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop teasing me, Professor. Every time I think of paint, I think of what we did on the floor back in Selinsgrove. And it gets me hot and bothered.\u201d She pouted in jest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to that later, I promise.\u201d He released her from his arms, smiling slyly. \u201cI like your socks.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her feet and flexed them.</p><p>\u201cArgyle is sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. A friend once told me that argyle is the fabric of seduction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have strange friends.\u201d She shook her head, plucking a grape from the fruit bowl and eating it.</p><p>He began unpacking the groceries, watching her from the corner of his eye. \u201dYou seem happy.\u201d</p><p>She hoisted herself up onto the counter and began to swing her legs back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI am. The conference is over; we had a great time in Rome and Assisi. I\u2019m in love with my husband and I get to share this fantastic house with him. I\u2019m the luckiest woman in the universe.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201dIn the universe? Hmmm. I\u2019m sure the inhabitants of the galaxy next door will be sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>She playfully poked him with her argyle-covered foot. \u201dYou\u2019re a nerd.\u201d</p><p>He turned on her and grabbed her foot, pulling it upward until her leg was extended to the height of his shoulder. She reclined on her elbows to maintain her balance.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d He feigned anger, but his sapphire eyes twinkled.</p><p>\u201cUm, I called you a nerd.\u201d</p><p>He raised a single eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Would a nerd do this?\u201d Expertly, Gabriel used his fingers to stroke the contours of Julia\u2019s instep.</p><p>When she sighed at the pleasant sensation, he peeled off her socks before tossing them over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if we can get you all hot and bothered, shall we?\u201d His voice was low, and it made Julia quiver.</p><p>He slid his hand over her leg, toying with the back of her knee until she groaned.</p><p>\u201cJulianne,\u201d he growled, his eyes dancing.</p><p>\u201cY-yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t wearing panties.\u201d</p><p>With a single finger, he traveled the length of her inner thigh and back again, stroking up and down in a patient rhythm.</p><p>She began to breathe rather rapidly as his fingers approached where she was exposed.</p><p>\u201cNerds are not known for their skills in lovemaking.\u201d Gabriel withdrew his hand and placed his index finger against her mouth.</p><p>She parted her lips and he pressed his finger inside. She closed around him, sucking his finger slightly before releasing it.</p><p>He winked at her before using his now-moistened finger to stroke the inside of her upper thigh.</p><p>\u201cWould a nerd know to do this?\u201d He leaned over and began to blow across the trail of wetness he\u2019d left with his finger.</p><p>When Julia shivered, he smiled wickedly and nuzzled the same trail with his nose.</p><p>Standing up again, he kissed her hungrily and then abruptly retreated. Before she had the time to protest, he dropped to his knees in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHmmmm,\u201d he said, moving her legs so that they rested on his shoulders again. \u201cThis counter seems to be the perfect height. I guess you really are the luckiest woman in the universe.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>The following evening, Julia awoke in the middle of the night and visited the en-suite. On her return, she heard Gabriel shifting in bed, a few muffled words escaping his lips.</p><p>This was not surprising. Gabriel was usually a deep sleeper, but there were nights when he\u2019d toss and turn and even talk in his sleep. Usually, Julia wasn\u2019t bothered by it. But on this evening, he started thrashing in bed and cursing.</p><p>She was at his side instantly. \u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>He continued his erratic movements, punctuated as they were by moments of torpor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She switched on the lamp. \u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>He mumbled. Then, all of a sudden, he tore at the bedclothes, wrestling and flailing until he was free.</p><p>His eyes shot open and he sat up, gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Julia elected to keep her distance, speaking in a low voice.</p> <p>He looked at her, disoriented, and clutched his chest.</p><p>\u201cIs it your heart? Can you breathe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNightmare.\u201d His voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you a drink.\u201d Julia returned to the en-suite and retrieved a glass, filling it with water from the tap. He accepted it wordlessly.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed and waited, watching him closely.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was your nightmare about?\u201d</p><p>He finished his drink, placing the glass on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d</p><p>Julia wanted to brush his dark hair back from his forehead, but she didn\u2019t think he would welcome the gesture.</p><p>His blue eyes blinked before fixing on the wall behind her.</p><p>\u201cMy biological parents.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sweetie.\u201d Julia reached out to hug him, but he stiffened. She paused for a moment, then walked over to her side of the bed.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t move. He didn\u2019t even bother to turn out the light but continued to sit with his back against the headboard.</p><p>She slid over to him, underneath the sheets. She wanted to comfort him. But the air around him was charged with a strange kind of energy. Gabriel didn\u2019t want to be touched.</p><p>She closed her eyes and had almost drifted into sleep, when his voice came out of the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI was with my mother in our old apartment in Brooklyn. I could hear her and my father arguing.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes snapped open.</p><p>\u201cI heard a crash. I heard my mother crying. I ran into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was kneeling on the floor. He was standing over her, shouting. I hit him with my fists. I shouted back. He shoved me and went to the front door. My mother crawled after him, begging him not to leave.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes glinted coldly, anger distorting his handsome features.</p><p>\u201cFucking bastard,\u201d he spat.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Julia murmured. She slid her hand across the sheet, making contact with his hip.</p><p>\u201cI hate him. He\u2019s been dead for years and still, if I knew where his grave was, I\u2019d piss on it.\u201d</p><p>Julia pressed her palm into his hip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, she stroked his skin softly, an act that was meant to be soothing.</p><p>\u201cHe hit her. It was bad enough that he seduced her and abandoned us. But the asshole hit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still staring off into space.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Julia stilled. \u201cYou think it was real?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel covered his eyes, pressing his fingers into the sockets. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was the first time they fought. Or the first time I intervened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung. Five or six. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a brave boy, defending your mother.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel dropped his hands into his lap.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t do any good. He broke her. Can you imagine crawling after a man who hit you? In front of your son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, look at me.\u201d Her tone was gentle.</p><p>He turned in her direction, his eyes blazing fire.</p><p>\u201cI stayed with Simon,\u201d she remarked quietly.</p><p>Gabriel blinked, and slowly the fire in his eyes began to diminish.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know your mother. But I know how messed up my head was when I was with Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different. You were young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine your mother was very old when she had you. How old was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>\u201cShe thought she loved him. She had a child with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was married.\u201d</p><p>Julia fidgeted with the sheet that covered her. \u201cWe can\u2019t change our pasts. All we can change is the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I woke you.\u201d Gabriel pressed a kiss against her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back so he could see her face. \u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a female problem to attend to.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, realization passed over his features. \u201cOh. Are you feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling my best but it will pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you seemed a little sensitive earlier.\u201d He ghosted a hand over her breasts.</p><p>She grabbed his hand, stilling it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your nightmare.\u201d</p><p>He moved away, turning the light off. Then he slipped under the sheet next to her.</p><p>She could hear him bring his teeth together, clenching his jaw.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think it\u2019s a memory and not just a nightmare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I can\u2019t tell,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cHas it happened before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn occasion. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t something I like to discuss, Julianne. My memories of my childhood are vague at best. And what I remember, I try to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told Dr. Townsend about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly, yes.\u201d He touched Julia absently, floating his fingertips over her back. \u201cI know very little about my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand your anger at your parents. But it isn\u2019t a healthy thing to hold on to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d He stopped touching her and rolled to his side, facing her. \u201cThere might be terrible skeletons in my family\u2019s closet. Could you love me in spite of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never love you in spite of anything, Gabriel. I just love you.\u201d</p><p>He captured her mouth, but only for an instant. They relaxed into the bed, spooning under the covers.</p><p>Just as she was about to drift into sleep, Gabriel\u2019s voice sounded in her ear.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, Julia was sunning herself by the pool before it grew too warm. She wore a large sun hat and a very small blue bikini. Gabriel had persuaded her to purchase the bikini during their trip to Belize before they were married. She had had few occasions to wear it.</p><p>She thought back to the previous evening and Gabriel\u2019s nightmare. It had disturbed them both. She couldn\u2019t help but envision what he\u2019d described\u2014his mother on the floor, crawling after the man who fathered her child and abandoned her. Perhaps that image, fictional or otherwise, was part of what generated Gabriel\u2019s intense antipathy to the sight of Julia on her knees. Even now, several months into their marriage, that was one position he couldn\u2019t countenance.</p><p>Perhaps it\u2019s because of Paulina.</p><p>Julia winced. She didn\u2019t like thinking of Gabriel\u2019s former lover and the mother of the child they\u2019d lost. But unless Gabriel was hiding something, he hadn\u2019t heard from her in over a year.</p><p>Julia was inclined to let sleeping dogs lie.</p><p>A shadow fell over her legs and she looked through her sunglasses to see him standing over her. He was clad only in black swimming trunks and was carrying a towel.</p><p>His muscled chest and arms rippled as he moved, kissing her before placing the towel on a chair and diving into the pool. The water was warm and a welcome respite from the bright Umbrian sun.</p><p>Gabriel swam laps, losing himself in the almost-silence of the water. Back and forth and back and forth. During physical exercise, as during sex, he could relieve his mind of all worry and stress, focusing only on his movements.</p><p>He actively suppressed all thought or reflection on his nightmare. An intuition had taken hold that told him that the dream was a memory. No amount of reasoning had been able to persuade him otherwise. So he simply turned his attention to something else\u2014the feel of the sun and the water against his flesh, the sound of splashing in his ears, the taste of chlorine, the glorious burn in his muscles as he pushed himself to swim faster.</p><p>He was counting laps, flip turn upon flip turn, when the peacefulness of his morning swim was broken by a sudden cry.</p><p>He surfaced immediately, his eyes searching for Julia. She was still in her chair, but she\u2019d swung her legs over the side of the lounge and was holding her iPhone to her ear.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d Julia\u2019s voice was unusually shrill.</p><p>Gabriel wiped his eyes so he could see her better.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d She paused, mouth gaping. \u201cWhen is she due?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel swam to the ladder and climbed out of the pool. He picked up his towel and began to dry off, his eyes fixed on her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m happy for you both. I just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Her tone was sincere, if not surprised, but her body language was notably tense.</p><p>Gabriel waved a hand in front of her face. \u201cWho is it?\u201d He pointed at the phone.</p><p>My dad, she mouthed.</p><p>Now it was Gabriel\u2019s turn to gape. If her words meant what he thought they meant, then . . .</p><p>\u201cSo when is the wedding?\u201d Julia peered up at Gabriel, lifting her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll check with him and get back to you. Wow, Dad. This is really sudden.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes, for you too. Obviously.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel reached over and placed a hand on her shoulder. She covered his hand with her own.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Put her on.\u201d Julia paused. \u201cHi, Diane. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wiped his face with the towel a second time and moved to sit on the lounge next to Julia.</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ll be there. We just need to sort out the date.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Congratulations again. Bye.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad. I\u2019m happy for you both.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Julia disconnected the phone and slumped in her seat. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad is getting married.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cI gathered that. They spoke to you about it in Selinsgrove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they want to get married immediately because Diane is pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stifled a grin.</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d He stroked the stubble on his chin, pretending to be deep in thought. \u201cA shotgun wedding for Tom, who is probably the only person I know who actually owns a shotgun. I\u2019d label the situation as ironic, except I know better.\u201d He winked.</p><p>Julia adjusted her sunglasses. \u201cYes, literature professors have an annoying habit of actually using words correctly. It takes all the fun out of a good neologism.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnd that remark there\u201d\u2014he paused to kiss her mouth\u2014\u201cis precisely why I love you, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you loved me for my breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am equally partial to all of your assets.\u201d He slid his hand down to the edge of her bikini bottom, giving it a playful tug.</p><p>\u201cYou are entirely too charming for your own good, Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m told. When\u2019s the baby due?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnd of December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you upset?\u201d He removed her hat and her sunglasses, so he could see her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m in shock. My dad is having a baby. We didn\u2019t light a candle for him in Assisi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good thing, or God would have sent him twins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was a shock for your father.

At least I know what to buy him for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s mouth widened into a slow, satisfied smile.</p><p>\u201cCondoms.\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo when are they getting married?\u201d</p><p>Julia gestured between them. \u201cThat depends on us. They want us to be there, so as soon as we can get back.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not cutting short our vacation for their wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEasy, tiger. They\u2019re asking us to fly to Selinsgrove for a weekend when we get back. They want us to give them some dates and then they\u2019ll talk to Diane\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a big sister.\u201d</p><p>A startled look passed over her features.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have a sibling,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI always wanted a brother or sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig sister Julia,\u201d said Gabriel. \u201cWith all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities. I always hated being an only child. I was glad when Scott and Rachel became my siblings. Even though Scott was a pest for most of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how this happened.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Gabriel suppressed a grin. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed to hear you say that, Mrs. Emerson. Obviously, our nocturnal activities haven\u2019t been\u2014ah\u2014memorable enough.\u201d</p><p>Julia frowned. \u201cYou know what I meant. My dad is old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t that old. Diane is even younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s forty. She told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA spring chicken.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked at him out of the corner of her eye. \u201cDid you just say spring chicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Your dad found himself an attractive young fianc\u00e9e and now he\u2019s about to be a father. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad is going to be a father,\u201d Julia repeated, a faraway expression in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re in shock.\u201d Gabriel stood up. \u201cMaybe I should get you a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel wants to have a baby, Dad is having a baby, and we . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>Gabriel leaned over her. \u201cLook at it this way. There will be lots of older kids for our children to play with during Christmas and summer vacations. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas and summer vacations. All those kids. Holy shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Gabriel smiled. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>That same day, Christa Peterson strode into the Department of Italian at Columbia University a few minutes early for her appointment with Professor Lucia Barini, the chair. Christa had successfully escaped Professor Pacciani and returned to New York, nursing her wounds (both internal and external) and vowing her revenge.</p><p>When she thought about what had happened to her at the Malmaison Hotel in Oxford, she did not use the word rape. But she had, in fact, been raped. He\u2019d forced her to have sex and used violence to subdue and overpower her. For various reasons, Christa chose to think of what happened to her as a loss of control. He took power away from her and used it against her. She was going to do the same to him. Only she was going to make sure he suffered more.</p><p>He\u2019d sent an email offering a halfhearted apology. She\u2019d ignored it.</p><p>In fact, she\u2019d decided to dedicate her considerable energy to ruining him. She wrote a long letter to his wife (in Italian), detailing their affair from the early days when she was Pacciani\u2019s student in Florence. She enclosed photographic evidence (some of which was pornographic), along with copies of salacious emails. If that wasn\u2019t enough to make his life difficult, she intended to bide her time until she could do something really damaging.</p><p>Which was why when she heard a rumor that Professor Pacciani intended to apply for a job in her very department, Christa made an appointment to speak with Professor Barini.</p><p>Because she was so intent on revenge, she hadn\u2019t had much time or energy to devote to Professor Emerson and Julianne. In fact, she\u2019d almost forgotten about them.</p><p>Since she was early for her appointment, Christa decided to check her departmental pigeonhole. From it, she retrieved a business-sized envelope, emblazoned with the name and address of a prominent New York law firm. She hastily ripped open the letter and read the contents.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>The Professor hadn\u2019t been kidding when he said that he was going to shut her up. She held in her hand a cease-and-desist letter that accused her of several incidents of public defamation of character. Each incident was described in painstaking detail, along with the legal implications of her statements. The letter threatened further action if she persisted in making slanderous remarks about Gabriel or his wife, reserving the right to take action on those incidents that had already occurred.</p><p>Fuck, she thought.</p><p>Part of her wanted to pen a saucy reply to the law firm. Part of her wanted to continue her crusade to ruin the Emersons simply out of spite.</p><p>But as she looked at the other pigeonholes, she realized that such an act would be foolish. If she ever wanted to be admitted to the PhD program and actually graduate, she couldn\u2019t do anything that would embarrass her department.</p><p>(And besides, she had a much larger fish to fry.)</p><p>As she crammed the letter into her purse, she resolved to forget about the Emersons and focus her attention on ending the career of one Professor Pacciani. To do this, she was going to expose her affair with him.</p><p>And, playing the part of the insecure and easily controlled graduate student in Professor Barini\u2019s office, that was precisely what Christa did.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Across the ocean, Gabriel switched the light off before pulling Julia into his arms. He began to kiss her neck ardently.</p><p>She tensed.</p><p>He paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, remember? I\u2019ll probably be finished the day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kissing you because I expect sex.\u201d</p><p>She arched an eyebrow in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI have a fairly good memory. I remembered that you were on your cycle.\u201d He pulled away, sounding chippy.</p><p>She tugged at his arm. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t want you to get your hopes up.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his voice to a husky whisper. \u201cHope springs eternal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll show you. Eternally.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and curved herself into him.</p><p>\u201cSo much witty repart\u00e9e, Professor. I can almost imagine I\u2019m in a Cary Grant movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flatter me.\u201d He kissed her eyelids. \u201cAre you excited about being a big sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I want the baby to know me. I want to spend time with him or her. I\u2019ve waited my whole life for a sibling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were planning to spend part of our vacations in Selinsgrove, anyway. As Rachel\u2019s and Scott\u2019s families expand, we\u2019ll want to spend time with them too. Selinsgrove is the best place to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another reason to be glad that Richard decided to move back into the house. We\u2019ll all be together.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pulled a lock of her hair thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ve come to like your shorter hair. It suits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough I like your hair long, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will grow back, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stopped his movements.</p><p>\u201cI have half siblings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Julia forced herself to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cWhen my mother was upset, she used to say that my father left us because he loved his real family more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a terrible thing to say to a child.\u201d Julia\u2019s tone was severe.</p><p>\u201cYes. She was troubled, but beautiful. Dark hair and dark eyes.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave him a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cI have my father\u2019s eyes, apparently. I remember my mother being tall, but I can\u2019t imagine she was more than a few inches taller than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was her first name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuzanne. Suzanne Emerson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any photographs of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. There are baby pictures of me, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been holding out on me. Why have I never seen them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t hidden. They\u2019re in a drawer back in Cambridge. I even have her diary.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou have your mother\u2019s diary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her father\u2019s pocket watch. I use it, on occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever read the diary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Sharon had left me a diary, I would have read it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gazed at her quizzically. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t have anything of your mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sent my father a box of her stuff when she died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have no idea what\u2019s in it. Dad used to keep it in his closet. I\u2019m assuming he still has it. Now that you\u2019ve reminded me, I should probably ask him to let me see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. How much do you know about your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. I seem to remember meeting him once or twice, not counting the content of last night\u2019s dream. When he died, I had a few conversations with his lawyer. I know my father lived in New York and had a wife and children. Initially, I declined the inheritance, but when I changed my mind they tried to break the will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he disinherit them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar from it. A year before he died, he added me as an equal beneficiary to his other children. His wife also received a substantial inheritance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you never met them?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughed without amusement. \u201cDo you think they were in a hurry to meet the bastard who was stealing their birthright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. They aren\u2019t my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your father\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOwen Davies.\u201d Gabriel lifted her chin with his finger. \u201cI\u2019ve told you these things and I\u2019ll share what photos I have when we get home. But I want you to promise you won\u2019t look into my family.\u201d</p><p>His expression was intense, if not severe. But there was something else in his eyes that she couldn\u2019t quite decipher.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He brought her head back to rest on his shoulder.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>August 2011</p><p>Near Essex Junction, Vermont</p><p>The following evening, Paul sat at the kitchen table in his parents\u2019 farmhouse, staring at his laptop. It was almost seven o\u2019clock.</p><p>He\u2019d been home from England for two weeks. Every day he sat down to type an email to Julia, and every day he found he couldn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her emails were always cheerful, and the most recent one was no exception. She\u2019d written him from Italy, urging him to visit the Vatican museum the next time he was in Rome. As if he needed urging. As if he needed the reminder that she was married and jet-setting around Europe with her dashing and older husband, who was probably thinking of ways to persuade her to have his baby.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>Paul was a rugby player. He was tough. But somehow, this slip of a woman from Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, had turned his life upside down. Now he was afraid of doing what he\u2019d already determined to do.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he muttered. He started to type, the words just beginning to flow, when he heard a knock at the back door.</p> <p>Curious, he answered it.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Allison greeted him, standing outside and holding two large coffees from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. \u201cI thought you could use one of these.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, she gave him an uneasy smile. \u201cAre you working on your dissertation? I don\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>She handed him a coffee. \u201cI\u2019ll just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Come in.\u201d He held the screen door open.</p> <p>She thanked him and walked into the kitchen, pulling out a chair across from where his computer was situated.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you since you got back from England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d His voice had a slight edge to it. \u201cMy dissertation director is kicking my ass and I have a lot of ground to cover before September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was your trip?\u201d</p><p>Paul sipped his coffee and made an appreciative noise. \u201cIt was good. My paper went well and I was able to talk to my director.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded, clutching her cup a little too tightly. \u201cWas she there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer name is Julia.\u201d Paul\u2019s tone was sharp.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI met her in this kitchen, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she was there.\u201d He tasted his drink again.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good. Her husband was there, too.\u201d</p><p>Allison searched Paul\u2019s unusually morose expression.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound happy.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a half-smile. \u201cWhy are you sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t like to see you pining.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged but didn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to compose an email to her when you knocked on the door.\u201d</p><p>Allison gripped her cup in two hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. But I think it\u2019s weird that she\u2019s keeping in touch with you, given your history. It\u2019s like she\u2019s leading you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you don\u2019t know her.\u201d Paul glared.</p><p>\u201cI doubt her husband is happy about her emailing you.\u201d</p><p>Paul muttered something unflattering about the Professor.</p><p>Allison sat still for a moment, as if she were waiting for something. Then she stood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see myself out.\u201d</p><p>Her former boyfriend followed her to the back door. \u201cThanks for the coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She stepped outside.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t turn around but stood facing the driveway.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>August 2011</p><p>Umbria, Italy</p><p>Every time Julia sat down at her computer, she was tempted to Google Gabriel\u2019s parents. But he\u2019d exacted a promise from her and she wouldn\u2019t betray him, no matter how difficult it was to keep that promise.</p><p>On one such morning, Julia was checking her email when she found something from Paul. She opened it.</p><p>After she read the message, she sat back in her chair, stunned.</p><p>\u201cDo you want eggs for breakfast? Or fruit and cheese?\u201d Gabriel called from the kitchen, which was next to the living room.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cShould I make eggs for breakfast, or just fruit and cheese? There\u2019s also pastries from the bakery.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him in evident distress.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got an email from Paul.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel resisted the urge to comment on the Angelfucker and his behavior. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, she pointed at the computer screen.</p><p>Gabriel fished around in his pocket for his glasses and put them on.</p><p>Dear Julia,</p><p>Thanks for your email. You did a great job with your paper and I thought you handled the questions well, especially Christa\u2019s. I was impressed.</p><p>Professor Picton was very complimentary. She doesn\u2019t praise people often, so you should be proud of yourself.</p><p>Please pass along my congratulations to your father and his girlfriend. He\u2019s a good guy and I\u2019m happy for them.</p><p>I\u2019m back in Vermont. My dad\u2019s health continues to improve. Thanks for asking. I\u2019ll tell him and Mom that you said hello.</p><p>I\u2019m determined to meet Professor Picton\u2019s deadlines, so my parents have hired more help at the farm. I hope to go on the job market this fall and pick up some interviews at the Modern Language Association meeting. If I don\u2019t get a job, I\u2019m back on the farm for another year.</p><p>I\u2019m glad we had a chance to go to lunch. It was good to see you.</p><p>There were some things I should have said, but didn\u2019t. I guess I should say them now.</p><p>I think we need to go our separate ways. You\u2019re married and I need to move on.</p><p>Maybe it will be easier for me in the future. But in the meantime, we should stop emailing.</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to hurt you, so please don\u2019t take it that way. I care about you, but I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while and believe it\u2019s for the best.</p><p>Be happy, Rabbit.</p><p>Paul</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes focused on hers. She looked stricken.</p><p>\u201cI sent him a couple of emails. It took him days to reply. And look at what he said.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel crouched down, placing his hand on Julia\u2019s knee. \u201cHe\u2019s in love with you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he loved me once.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked at her gravely. \u201cDid you stop loving me when I left Toronto?\u201d</p><p>She nibbled on the edge of one of her fingernails. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he truly loves you, he\u2019ll love you for a long time. Maybe forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why wouldn\u2019t he want to be friends?\u201d She turned troubled eyes in his direction.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s too painful.\u201d Gabriel cupped her cheek. \u201cIf I\u2019d lost you to him, I couldn\u2019t be friends with you. I\u2019d simply have to love you from a distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant to hurt him,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he realizes that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he try to talk to me about it when we were in Oxford?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to upset you before your lecture.\u201d</p><p>Julia turned suspicious eyes in her husband\u2019s direction. \u201cDid you know about this?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel hesitated, ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the same reason he didn\u2019t bring it up. We wanted you to be in the best frame of mind at the conference.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her chair back from the table. \u201cSo you and Paul discussed this? You discussed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you now. Truthfully, Julianne, I thought he\u2019d change his mind. But once again, Paul has surprised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dole out information like vitamins.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lifted his head, a smile playing about his lips. \u201cVitamins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying. You and your secrets.\u201d She rose to her feet, but he caught her wrist.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have secrets from you. We agreed not to disclose everything from our pasts for the sake of moving forward. But if you want full disclosure, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d He lifted his chin in challenge. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll ask you for full disclosure. For example, did you happen to have a conversation with Paul about dropping out of Harvard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tore a strip off me, telling me I had to make sure you didn\u2019t abandon your dreams.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhen did he say this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Oxford, right after your lunch. So don\u2019t lecture me on keeping secrets, Julianne. I\u2019m not having lunch with old flames and telling them about our marital conflicts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you call it, then?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands and then let them drop to her sides. \u201cIt just\u2014came out. I was worried and needed someone to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it ever occur to you that you already have someone to talk to?\u201d Gabriel glanced between them significantly. \u201cSomeone infinitely closer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that. I can even support it. But time to think and going to someone else to talk about our problems are two different things. That was not the right thing to do, Julianne, and you know it.\u201d His tone was reproving.</p><p>Julia stared, expecting him to explode into temper. Surprisingly, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>(Which demonstrated, clearly, that the Apocalypse was nigh.)</p><p>Gabriel continued. \u201cI don\u2019t share our problems with anyone. And yes, sometimes I dole out information, as you so charmingly put it, in order to protect you. But it is always, always, done with love.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slid from her wrist to her hand. \u201cI tried to persuade Paul not to cut off contact with you. Not because that was what I wanted, but because I didn\u2019t want to see you hurt.\u201d</p><p>Julia blinked back tears that had suddenly appeared. \u201cWhat hurts is the fact that you don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not with your family history.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his teeth. \u201cYou know what I know\u2014that my mother\u2019s family disowned her and left me to foster care after her death. My father abandoned us. Do you want me to investigate such people? Just so I can discover more unsavory details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey made you, Gabriel. There has to be something in your family history that\u2019s worth knowing. And of course I don\u2019t want you to be upset. But your family is part of you. If we have children, eventually they\u2019ll ask about their grandparents.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel dropped her hand, his face a mask of stone.</p><p>\u201cIf I could expunge them from my memory, I would. I won\u2019t have our children so polluted.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cA man as good and as brilliant as you came from that pollution. And so will our children.\u201d</p><p>His expression softened. He raised her hand to his lips and kissed the back of it. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t have gone to Paul with my worries. But he was my friend.\u201d Julia continued to fight back the tears.</p><p>He pressed her face into his chest.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>At bedtime, Gabriel strode into the master suite. He was barefoot, clad only in a white shirt and jeans. When he caught sight of Julianne, he began rolling up his sleeves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you still on your cycle?\u201d</p><p>Julia was standing by the washroom, having just finished brushing her teeth and washing her face.</p><p>\u201cI finished yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Take off your clothes and lie on the bed.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>His eyes seemed to burn through her. Without argument, she undressed quickly, dropping her clothes to the floor before climbing onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cOn your stomach. Eyes closed.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help trembling at the tone of his voice, but she did what he said. With eyes closed, her other senses were heightened. She felt the breath of air from the open window. She could hear Gabriel\u2019s sure footsteps against the tiled floor.</p> <p>Soon he chose music to fill the air, \u201cThe Look of Love\u201d performed by Diana Krall. Julia opened her eyes and saw that he\u2019d turned the lights out and lit candles next to the bed. A luminescent cloud filled her gaze.</p><p>\u201cEyes closed,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She did as she was bidden and felt the mattress move. His hands found her waist, lifting her in order to slide a pillow beneath her hips. Seemingly satisfied with her position, his lips blazed a trail from dimple to dimple before coming to rest at the base of her spine.</p><p>A single finger traced up to the nape of her neck, gliding across her shoulders. Another pillow was placed under her naked breasts before he stretched her arms above her head.</p><p>\u201cA work of art.\u201d He breathed in her ear before kissing just behind it, drawing the skin into his mouth. His palm traveled the length of her back twice before exploring her bottom and legs.</p><p>The bed shifted and the music changed to Sting\u2019s \u201cI Burn for You.\u201d Julia felt more than a fluttering of desire.</p> <p>She could feel his presence next to the bed, but she heard nothing until he set a couple of objects on the table. She turned her head in the direction of the sound, but Gabriel placed a hand over her eyes, blocking her sight.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He passed his hand over the back of her head, pulling her hair to one side. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you these past few days. I\u2019ve been looking forward to getting reacquainted.\u201d</p><p>Julia heard him straighten, and after a few moments she heard the rustling of clothing and the sound of his belt hitting the floor. Then she heard the subtle sound of his underwear sliding over his skin.</p><p>She opened her left eye, drinking in the sight of her naked husband, watching as he turned his back in order to arrange things on the table. She sighed in appreciation of his form and closed her eyes once again.</p><p>She heard something liquid and the sound of his hands rubbing together before the bed moved once again. Then he was massaging her shoulders.</p><p>She groaned.</p> <p>\u201cYou like that, do you?\u201d</p><p>She hummed. The scent of satsuma and sandalwood filled her nose: the scent of their first time together.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only just begun.\u201d</p><p>He took his time, worshipping her body with his hands. On occasion, his nakedness would rub up against her. She would move to deepen the contact, but he would only chuckle and retreat.</p><p>After what seemed like hours she drifted into an almost unconscious state, totally and completely relaxed. All thoughts of anything other than Gabriel flew out of her head.</p><p>He brought his mouth to her neck, drawing the flesh against his lips and gently sucking. His large hands slid the length of her arms until they took hold of her wrists, stretching them out to her sides like a cross.</p><p>Then his naked body was over hers, pressing his front to her back.</p><p>She murmured at the contact.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s too much, tell me.\u201d</p><p>It was an intense feeling. She preferred frontal contact, but there was something about Gabriel spread over her like a second skin that was especially intimate and erotic.</p><p>When he heard her breathing grow shallow, he took his weight with his knees, separating her legs. She inhaled and he placed a hand under her to cup her right breast.</p><p>Julia moaned her approval.</p><p>He moved his left hand beneath her to the junction of her thighs, his fingers sliding against her skin.</p><p>He petted her, his hands working in concert, drawing pleasure from both parts of her body. Then, ever so slowly, he pushed inside.</p><p>He stilled. The feeling of being inside her in this position was almost overwhelming. They always fit together well, but on this occasion, the sensation of their joining assailed his control.</p><p>Julia pushed back against him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>She froze and he felt her inhale shakily, her back moving against his front.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a goddess. But\u2014don\u2019t\u2014move.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled against the sheets, and then ever so slowly, she lifted her hips and pressed back against him.</p><p>With a groan and a curse, he moved inside her, quickly and forcefully. Within minutes they were joining at a frantic pace, the air alive with the sounds of pleasure.</p><p>Julia lifted her hips one last time, and he felt her shudder around him.</p><p>He could contain himself no longer and rapidly followed.</p><p>When he\u2019d caught his breath, he stretched over her like a banner, his lips smiling against her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThis is transcendence,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve never had better.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>His palm rested on her backside and he felt her body sink into the bed as a wide, joyous smile spread across her face.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>The next morning Julia awoke to the sound of Gabriel snoring. He rarely snored, but when he did, it was a force of nature.</p><p>(Even Dante specialists snore, on occasion.)</p><p>She\u2019d slept soundly all night. He\u2019d given her a gift\u2014the knowledge that she was the sexual pinnacle for him as he most gloriously was for her. A delicious feeling of anticipation and uncertainty filled her at the prospect of repeating the previous evening\u2019s activities.</p><p>Gabriel loved her. That fact gave her confidence when it came to ceding control to him. But as C.S. Lewis had once written about Aslan, Gabriel was not tame. There was always a hint of danger and unpredictability surrounding him.</p><p>With caution in mind, she elected not to wake him and inform him that he was snoring. Instead, she decided to brave convention and skinny-dip in the hot tub.</p><p>The hot tub sat on the balcony just outside their bedroom. Since their closest neighbor was several miles away, Julia didn\u2019t worry about dropping her bathrobe. She merely climbed into the tub and allowed the sun and gentle wind to caress her face, while the water soothed her tender spaces and sore muscles.</p><p>She\u2019d almost fallen asleep when she heard the sound of Gabriel\u2019s voice. She opened her eyes to find him clad only in his boxer shorts, talking on his iPhone.</p><p>She took a moment to admire the rugged beauty that was her untamed professor.</p><p>With her eyes, she traced the curves of his muscles, the lines and tendons that etched his arms. She watched the strands of hair that decorated his chest, and their cousins that led from his navel to the band of his underwear.</p><p>Julia glanced at their surroundings\u2014at the hills and valleys surrounding their villa. No one could see them.</p><p>Without warning, Gabriel ended his conversation and put his phone on a table nearby.</p><p>\u201cCan I join you? Or are you simply interested in a show?\u201d He flexed his biceps theatrically.</p><p>Julia swallowed noisily. \u201cUm, what\u2019s included in the price of admission?\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you desire. I\u2019m here to please, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d He dropped his voice. \u201cSo name your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Julia indicated that he should approach, and he quickly divested himself of his shorts and joined her in the hot water. She straddled his lap, wrapping her arms around him. \u201cAll I want is the pleasure of your company.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel hugged her and she rested her chin on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThank you for last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is I who should be thanking you, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little dense sometimes. It only just occurred to me that you went to so much trouble last night because you were trying to cheer me up.\u201d She toyed with his chest hair.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t exactly true. We hadn\u2019t made love for a few days, since you were on your cycle. That gave me time to think about how I wanted to go about reconnecting with you.\u201d He lifted her hair off the back of her neck, and slid his fingers through it.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to know that I appreciate it. I appreciate the care you take in planning our times together and also that you knew I was feeling bad yesterday.\u201d She placed her palm over his tattoo, near his heart. \u201cAnd that you told me you\u2019ve never had better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Sex is different with you. We have attraction, of course, and chemistry. But we also have affection and love. When all of those things are combined . . .\u201d He trailed off.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She brushed her lips against his. \u201cWho were you talking to on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? What did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and Tammy would like to bring Quinn to Boston for a weekend in the fall. They\u2019d like to stay with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d have to check with you, but we\u2019d be glad to have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you and your brother have patched things up.\u201d She kissed his neck. \u201cSometimes I wish we were the same age. We could have gone to the prom together.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nuzzled her.</p><p>\u201cIt would have been an honor to take you to prom, but it\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t know you when I was a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wouldn\u2019t have treated you the way you deserve.\u201d</p><p>She moved so that she could see his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. You treated me well the first night we met, back in the orchard. You would have behaved the same way when you were younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. There\u2019s something about you . . .\u201d He smiled. \u201cWe can arrange to have a prom here, just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to buy a dress that\u2019s too short and that will give my father a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall inviting him,\u201d Gabriel growled, kissing her. \u201cHow short is too short?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, just a bit above the knee. I\u2019m shy.\u201d</p><p>He nipped at her lower lip. \u201cYou weren\u2019t shy last night.\u201d</p><p>She stroked the stubble on his jaw. \u201cYour love makes me brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, because I\u2019ll keep loving you. Forever.\u201d Gabriel slid his hands to her waist and pulled her against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened with Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Her expression turned wistful. \u201cFrom now on, if we\u2019re having problems I\u2019ll keep them between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to do the same.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that when couples marry, their friendships change.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve neglected our social life. I\u2019ll do better, I promise. We can invite people over for dinner and I\u2019ll accompany you to the pub nights at Grendel\u2019s Den with the other grad students.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like socializing with grad students. You\u2019d never join me before.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel brushed his thumb across her jaw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do almost anything to make you happy. I don\u2019t want you to regret a single moment we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew dangerous. \u201cSo come here.\u201d</p> <p>A few hours later, Gabriel heard the house telephone ring. He ignored it.</p><p>Curiosity eventually got the best of him and he stuck his head through the study doorway and into the hall. From a distance, he could hear Julia speaking Italian. Wondering who she was speaking with, he left his study to descend to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNo, Fra Silvestro. Non \u00e8 necessario.\u201d</p><p>Julia caught Gabriel\u2019s eye and lifted a finger, indicating that he should wait.</p><p>\u201cAllora dovremmo organizzare una festa per i bambini. Non per me.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows lifted and he crossed over to her, leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ec, per i bambini. Possiamo festeggiare i loro compleanni.\u201d She paused, and Gabriel could hear the Franciscan brother chattering away on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cCi dovranno essere regali, palloncini e una torta. E del gelato.\u201d Julia laughed. \u201cCerto. E\u2019 proprio quello che vorrei. . . . Ci vediamo, allora. Arrivederci.\u201d</p><p>Julia hung up the telephone. \u201cGood grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Brother Silvestro from the orphanage in Florence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is he calling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to speak to you but seemed delighted that you were indisposed.\u201d</p><p>The edges of Gabriel\u2019s lips turned up. \u201cSounds like he wanted to sweet-talk us and thought you\u2019d make a better target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. He wanted to host a party for us when we visit the orphanage next week.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel appeared surprised. \u201cAnd you said no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him to throw a party for the children, instead. We don\u2019t need a party.\u201d</p><p>Julia turned her attention to what she\u2019d been doing before she received the telephone call, which was preparing a light lunch.</p><p>Gabriel wrapped his arms around her from behind.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re very assertive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is something about you that\u2019s always puzzled me, Julianne. You give up what you want rather easily. But you\u2019re adamant about not giving in when it comes to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I give up what I want so easily. I didn\u2019t give up on you, did I? And you were pretty awful in the beginning.\u201d Julia peered up at him out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>He shifted his feet.</p><p>\u201cI had in mind how much you wanted to stay at Magdalen College and how you were willing to leave when I insisted.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t have the energy to fight with you. You were upset about the room. I don\u2019t like seeing you upset.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pressed his lips to her neck.</p><p>\u201cI think you need a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She reached up and tangled her fingers in his hair. \u201cI need a private party that involves me peeling my handsome husband out of his favorite pair of jeans.\u201d</p><p>She moved her mouth to his ear. \u201cBut your glasses stay on.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and pulled their lower bodies flush. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a thing for men in glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do. The way you feel about my high heels? That\u2019s how I feel about you in glasses. But first I have to call Fra Silvestro\u2019s assistant to see if she can rent a pony.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel straightened.</p><p>\u201cA pony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a bad idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you rent ponies? In Florence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure none of the children have ever seen a pony, let alone had the chance to ride one. I thought it would be fun.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel observed his wife\u2019s excitement with no little amount of joy.</p><p>\u201cIf you look after the gifts for the children, I\u2019ll find a pony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She gave him a saucy wink. \u201cOh, and while you\u2019re at it, see if you can rent a petting zoo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t respond to Paul\u2019s email. He\u2019d asked her not to contact him, and she decided to honor his request. She knew that eventually their paths would cross at a conference or a colloquium. She thought that once he became used to the idea that she\u2019d married Gabriel, he\u2019d be able to be friends with her again.</p><p>Or so she hoped.</p><p>But his request and the way he\u2019d done it\u2014via email\u2014had hurt. So she avoided her email for a couple of days. When she finally checked her account, she found a message from her father.</p><p>Jules,</p><p>Call me on my cell phone as soon as you get this message,</p><p>Dad.</p><p>Tom\u2019s emails and telephone messages were usually terse. He was not a man of many words. But the tone of this particular email was so ominous, Julia didn\u2019t bother to alert Gabriel as to what was happening. She simply picked up the telephone in the kitchen and dialed her father\u2019s cell phone.</p><p>He picked it up on the first ring. \u201cJules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Her father paused as if he were struggling to find the words. \u201cWe\u2019re at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hospital? Why? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Gabriel walked into the kitchen. Julia pointed to the telephone and mouthed the words My dad.</p><p>\u201cYesterday we went to have an ultrasound. We were supposed to find out the sex of the baby. But something was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son.\u201d Tom\u2019s voice broke on the last word.</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d Julia sniffled and her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Gabriel stood very close to his wife, so that he could hear both sides of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the Children\u2019s Hospital in Philadelphia. They agreed to see us right away.\u201d</p><p>Julia heard a muffled noise in the background, then heard her father whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right, honey. It\u2019s going to be all right. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that Diane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tom sounded strained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Dad. What did the doctor say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just met with the cardiologist. He says that the baby has hypoplastic left heart syndrome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that before. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means he only has half a heart.\u201d He inhaled slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s fatal, Jules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d A tear spilled onto her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t survive without surgery. So they\u2019ll have to operate after he\u2019s born. That is, if Diane can carry him to term. Sometimes . . .\u201d Tom\u2019s voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cCan they fix it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe surgery can make his heart do what it needs to do, but it can\u2019t give him a normal heart. They say it will take three different surgeries and a lifetime of medication. No one knows how well he\u2019ll do or if he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d Tom began to cough.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing anyone can do. Except pray.\u201d</p><p>Julia began to cry, and Gabriel gently removed the telephone from her hand.</p><p>\u201cTom? It\u2019s Gabriel. I\u2019m sorry about the baby. Let me book you a hotel near the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d Tom stopped abruptly, and Gabriel could hear Diane speaking in the background.</p><p>Tom sighed. \u201cOkay. That would be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make the arrangements and email you the information. Do you want to go to New York for a second opinion? I can make airline reservations for both of you. We can get you a referral to another hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctors here seem to know what they\u2019re doing. We have a meeting with the pediatric cardiac team tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes fixed earnestly on his wife\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDo you need Julianne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much she can do right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, she\u2019s your daughter and the baby is her brother. You say the word, she\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Tom sounded gruff. \u201cThings are up in the air right now.\u201d</p><p>Julia wiped at her tears and gestured to the telephone.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to speak with you. Take care, Tom.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel handed her the phone.</p><p>\u201cDad. Please keep in touch and let me know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to bring this up, but what about the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know, Jules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll plan on spending Labor Day in Selinsgrove. I can be there before that, if you and Diane need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to tell Richard?\u201d</p><p>Tom hesitated.</p><p>\u201cMight as well. The fewer people I have to have this conversation with the better. Diane was on the phone with her mother earlier and her sister, Melissa.\u201d</p><p>A tear slid down Julia\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dad. Give my love to Diane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Bye, Jules.\u201d</p><p>Julia quietly put down the phone. Then she was in Gabriel\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cThey were so happy about the baby.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her tightly as she clutched at his shirt.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at a good hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re devastated. It sounds like even if the heart problem can be corrected, the baby still will have health problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctors make predictions, but they\u2019re guided by probabilities. Every patient is different.\u201d</p><p>He straightened suddenly, as if something had just occurred to him.</p><p>\u201cDoes Tom have any health problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of. Both of his parents had heart disease.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think this is genetic, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He held her more closely. \u201cThere are few days when being an MD is infinitely better than being a PhD. This would be one of them.\u201d</p><p>More tears streaked down Julianne\u2019s cheeks. It had never occurred to her that something could be wrong with the baby. She\u2019d been so happy to be having a sibling that any of the risks were unthinkable.</p><p>As she cried in the arms of her husband, she realized that whatever grief she was feeling, Tom and Diane must be feeling tenfold.</p><p>\u201cHow could they have prepared themselves for this?\u201d she croaked. \u201cThey\u2019re devastated.\u201d</p><p>Julianne leaned against Gabriel, not noticing the expression on his face or the sudden flash of horror in his eyes.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>August 2003</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</p><p>Gabriel? Baby, it\u2019s time to get up.\u201d</p><p>A soft, feminine hand stroked the stubble on his face and for a moment, he relaxed. He wasn\u2019t sure where he was or who was lying naked beside him, but she had a sexy voice and a light touch. Cautiously, he opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby.\u201d Her large blue eyes stared down at him in devotion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPaulina,\u201d he groaned, closing his eyes.

But Professor Pearson didn\u2019t accept excuses from his teaching assistants, which meant he needed to drag himself to campus.</p><p>(It was possible the professor would have accepted death as an excuse as to why his teaching assistant missed class. Although it was doubtful.)</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s eight o\u2019clock. You have time for a shower and breakfast. And maybe a little . . .\u201d Her hand slid down his chest to his abdomen. Then she wrapped her fingers around him and . . .</p><p>And his morning erection withered in her hand like a dead flower.</p> <p>He pushed her away. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always say that. Is it because I\u2019m getting fat?\u201d She sat next to him, her stomach slightly rounded, her generous breasts full.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, which in itself was a kind of response.</p><p>\u201cI can make it good for you. You know I can.\u201d She hugged him around the shoulders, kissing his neck. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said not now. Fuck. Can\u2019t you hear?\u201d He disentangled himself from her arms before sliding his legs over the side of the bed. The hardwood floor was cool beneath his feet but he barely felt it.</p> <p>All his attention was focused on one thing\u2014the ghost of white powder left on his nightstand. Now he was awake, arranging the mirror and the razor blade and the rolled-up five-dollar bill.</p><p>The world around him melted away and he felt his mind and body spring to life, his movements sure and quick.</p><p>In the blink of an eye it was up his nose and everything was clear again. He was hyperalert. He could think. He could function.</p><p>He lit a cigarette, forgetting that his . . . whatever-she-was-now was in his bed, watching him. She wrapped herself in a robe and fled to the kitchen, not wanting to expose their unborn child to smoke.</p><p>He finished his cigarette and showered, pausing to drink the cup of coffee she\u2019d placed next to the sink. He brushed his teeth and shaved, his mind enumerating all the work he had to do on his dissertation, along with the interminable to-do list foisted on him by Professor Pearson.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t have time to examine his life or his actions. If he did, he would have realized that he was a slave, in chains, to cocaine, nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol.</p> <p>He was a slave to his passions, also, when his dick was working. Even though he was living with Paulina and she was pregnant, he was still sexually involved with other women. He never bothered to ask himself whether he should stop. In fact, he didn\u2019t think about it at all. He simply did it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re handsome.\u201d Paulina watched him from the doorway, her hand cradling her protruding abdomen over her black silk robe.</p><p>Gabriel ignored her, as he was wont to do. He also ignored the dark circles on his face, his bloodshot eyes, and the fact that he was a good ten to fifteen pounds lighter than his normal, healthy weight.</p><p>\u201cI made you breakfast. Scrambled eggs and toast.\u201d She sounded hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a long day ahead of you and Pearson is going to work you hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off my ass,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She looked down at her stomach contritely. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting on the table with fruit and a fresh coffee. All you have to do is eat.\u201d</p> <p>His sapphire eyes fixed on hers, watching her through the mirror.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he clipped.</p><p>She smiled to herself and disappeared into the tiny kitchen.</p><p>Soon he was dressed in the respectable uniform of a Harvard graduate student, complete with corduroy jacket and Levi\u2019s, and seated at the table, forcing down breakfast. He finished his third cup of coffee and was about to light another cigarette when he noticed that Paulina was staring at him. Hungrily.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She moved to sit in his lap, wrapping her arms around his neck.</p><p>He made an involuntary groan at her weight, not seeing her wince as he did so.</p><p>She brought her mouth to his ear. \u201cI know you\u2019re in a hurry. Just kiss me before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulina, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off with her lips, her tongue eager and searching as it snaked into his mouth.</p><p>His hands came to her waist as he kissed her back, feeling his body beginning to respond.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby.\u201d She reached for the button of his jeans. \u201cWe\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time.\u201d He placed her on her feet, groaning a little at the exertion. \u201cMaybe tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her face crumpled. \u201cBut you write at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t.\u201d She reached for his hand. \u201cGabriel, I love you. It\u2019s been a while. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her big blue eyes filled with tears and her lower lip trembled.</p><p>He rolled his eyes to the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cFine. But it needs to be fast.\u201d</p><p>He pushed his chair back from the table and gestured to his crotch.</p><p>\u201cGet started.\u201d</p><p>With an eager look on her face, she knelt between his legs and pulled down his zipper.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>August 2011</p><p>Umbria, Italy</p><p>Gabriel couldn\u2019t sleep, plagued as he was by hazy memories of the past. His mind twisted in several different directions, tugging him to and fro. Finally, he tired of tossing and turning and went downstairs to pour himself a drink.</p><p>As he stood in the kitchen he cursed. He\u2019d removed all the alcohol, with the exception of a couple of bottles of white wine reserved for Julianne. But wine would not satisfy his craving. Not tonight.</p><p>No, tonight he desired Scotch. The smoothness on his tongue, the quick burn in his mouth and throat, the latent warmth that would spread to his insides.</p><p>Just one. I just need one.</p><p>But it was no use. The Scotch was gone.</p><p>Gabriel thought of Julianne, upstairs in his bed. She was sleeping peacefully, unaware of the demons that plagued him. His very hands shook with desire.</p><p>He quickly ran through the twelve steps of Narcotics Anonymous before focusing on step two.</p><p>A power greater than myself can restore me.</p><p>Help me, God.</p><p>Please.</p><p>Gabriel closed his eyes and made the sign of the cross, his soul desperate and conflicted.</p><p>He knew that the keys to the Mercedes were steps away. He knew that he could drive to a local tavern and drink. Julia was sleeping soundly. He could return to their bed afterward and she would never know.</p><p>His eyes opened.</p><p>He reached for the keys.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>Gabriel?\u201d Julia\u2019s voice floated out to where he was seated on the balcony.</p><p>He was in a dark corner, brooding. He could hear her feet padding across the tiled floor and through the open doors as she approached him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She eyed the cigarette he held in one of his hands and the drink in the other.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He placed the cigarette to his lips and inhaled slowly before turning his face to the sky and blowing the smoke heavenward.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. Usually, I choose cigars.\u201d</p><p>She looked from his glass to his face, her eyes troubled.</p><p>He lifted his glass in mock salute.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s Coke.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI\u2019d prefer Laphroaig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he growled. \u201cThe house is bereft of alcohol except for wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly white. You prefer red.\u201d Her eyebrows knitted together. \u201cDid you go looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I did?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Julia began chewing at her bottom lip.</p><p>Gabriel put his cigarette in the ashtray and reached up, pressing his thumb against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He freed her lip, then picked up his cigarette, turning away from her.</p><p>Silence stretched between them, an immeasurable distance, until finally, she spoke.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He placed a hand to her hip, pressing into the gauzy whiteness of her nightgown. \u201cI need to ask you something.</p><p>\u201cHow healthy are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after midnight and you\u2019re asking about my health?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question.\u201d He sounded grim. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her hair back from her face. \u201cI\u2019m healthy. I have low blood pressure and I tend to have low iron levels, so I take a supplement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy low blood pressure is probably genetic. My mother had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenetic,\u201d he muttered, drawing on his cigarette again. The smoke billowed from his nostrils as if he were a dragon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit odd to ask me about my health while you\u2019re out here smoking, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than cocaine, Julianne.\u201d His voice was cold. \u201cHow did your mother die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking me this?\u201d She pulled away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou told me your mother died while you were living with your father. I didn\u2019t know if she had health problems or if it was an accident.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s expression was searching, but his eyes were guarded.</p><p>\u201cShe was drunk and fell down the stairs at her apartment building. Broke her neck.\u201d Julia gave him a venomous look. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>She turned to go back into the bedroom, but he caught her arm. \u201cJulianne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d She wrenched her arm free and turned on him. \u201cI love you, but you can be a cold son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>He was on his feet in an instant, his drink and cigarette discarded on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething is troubling you, but instead of discussing it with your wife, you\u2019d rather discuss it with your drink and your cigarette and the Umbrian landscape. Fine. Sit out here all night by yourself. But don\u2019t try to mindfuck me.\u201d</p><p>She moved toward the doors that led to their bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to mindfuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen warn me before you start spelunking through my unhappy memories.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tried to restrain a chuckle but failed.</p><p>She turned and glared. \u201cIt isn\u2019t funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpelunking, Julianne? Really?\u201d His face relaxed into a playful grin, at which she merely frowned.</p><p>He closed the space between them. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for laughing. You have an enviable vocabulary.\u201d</p><p>She struggled against his arms and then his lips were on hers. The dusky taste of smoke and tobacco invaded her mouth. His kiss was gentle but insistent.</p><p>In time, her posture softened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m in a foul mood. I shouldn\u2019t take it out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m upset, I talk to you. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away, running both hands through his hair, making its dark strands even more unruly.</p><p>She tugged at his elbow.</p><p>\u201cEveryone gets into a foul mood sometime. But you can\u2019t bring up certain topics so indelicately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven.\u201d She shivered. \u201cBut you\u2019re scaring me. You\u2019re looking for Scotch and talking about cocaine. You\u2019re asking me how my mother died. What\u2019s going on?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot tonight, Julianne.\u201d He scrubbed at his face with his hands. \u201cHaven\u2019t we had enough distress for one day? Go to bed. I\u2019m not fit for company.\u201d</p><p>He returned to his seat, his shoulders slumped.</p><p>Julia hesitated, her eyes darting between the doors to the bedroom and his face. Part of her wanted to leave him to brood alone. Part of her believed that he was in distress and that if she didn\u2019t attempt to intervene, he would spiral into a depression.</p><p>Or worse.</p> <p>She went to him, holding out a tentative baby finger, linking it with his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice sounded flat.</p><p>\u201cBefore we were together, when you\u2019d get into a foul mood, what would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d drink and do coke.

My troubles always came back the next morning.\u201d</p><p>She looked inside the bedroom, toward the large canopied bed.</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bed.\u201d She tugged at his pinky finger. \u201cTo work out our foul moods.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes seared into hers. Then he seemed to pull himself back.</p><p>\u201cThat is not a good idea. I told you, I\u2019m not myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. Who do you think I am?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re my husband and I think you need to fuck your bad mood away. So let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open.</p><p>When he\u2019d collected himself, his expression grew harsh. \u201cI don\u2019t fuck you, Julianne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019d rather I were someone else so you could.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed. \u201cThat is not true. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I do. You didn\u2019t touch me when we went to bed. I needed you but you said no.\u201d She stretched her arms wide. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? What you crave, I need. Help me forget I\u2019m about to lose the only sibling I\u2019ve ever had. Please.\u201d</p><p>He was torn. It was telegraphed in the way his eyes bore into hers and the eagerness that radiated from his skin.</p><p>On impulse, Julia wrapped an arm around his back and placed her other in his hair. She tugged his mouth toward hers and kissed him deeply.</p><p>He responded quickly, wrapping her legs around his hips. Soon he was controlling their kiss; his tongue in her mouth, insistent and urgent.</p><p>\u201cTake me to bed,\u201d she begged, when he finally drew breath.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to use the bed.\u201d</p><p>With a dangerous look, he carried her into the bedroom.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t bother with lamps or music before he pressed her against the nearest wall. A distant light from the open door to the bathroom lightened the dark bedroom to gray.</p><p>Her legs tightened around his hips as he pulled off her robe. The silk sank to the floor.</p><p>He placed two fingers in his mouth, wetting them, before reaching down to pet between her legs. She moaned and pressed against his hand. His touching grew more desperate.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d He brought his lips to her ear.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She wound her fingers in his hair, pulling his mouth to hers.</p><p>He explored her with his tongue, licking at her lips and thrusting inside. His hand slid around to cup her backside, pulling her against him.</p><p>\u201cWatch,\u201d he rasped, fluttering his mouth along her neck.</p><p>\u201cWatch what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs. In the mirror.\u201d</p><p>Julia opened her eyes and saw the mirror mounted on the wall on the other side of the room. Somehow, it was perfectly positioned to reflect her husband\u2019s magnificent and naked back and the dark-haired woman who was hidden by his body.</p><p>\u201cI want you to see what I see when you come.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel trailed kisses up and down her neck before rubbing his stubble against her chest. He cupped her breast in his hand, worshipping each one with his mouth. Licking and nipping and sucking.</p><p>He dropped a hand between her legs again and, using deliberate strokes, petted her as his mouth closed over a rosy peak.</p><p>Julia tried very hard to keep her eyes open, but it was difficult. His tongue teased her flesh, his lips tugging and pulling.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen what they looked like together. His body long and lean, hers smaller and softer. Their skin had different tones\u2014he was darker while she was fair.</p><p>Gabriel lavished her with single-minded attention. As if he were a dying man and this was his last assignation. Her very flesh nearly melted from the heat of his touch.</p><p>His focus caused the world to fall away, as it always did in those moments, his probing fingers and impatient erection brushing between her legs.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d she murmured, pulling back so she could see him. She was clutching his shoulders, almost climbing him.</p><p>\u201cI need you to come first. Eyes on the mirror.\u201d</p><p>He continued to pet her, resisting the urge to speed despite her desperate movements.</p><p>Without warning, her rosy lips parted and she gasped, her gaze fixed on their reflection.</p><p>Then with a single, deep thrust he was inside her.</p><p>She saw her eyes widen, her fingers tighten their grip on his shoulders. She saw his strong hips and lean, beautiful backside moving apace, pushing into her again and again.</p><p>She groaned, eyes closing.</p><p>\u201cI told you to watch,\u201d he growled, nipping her ear.</p><p>Her eyes opened and she saw him glaring at her.</p><p>She turned to look at the mirror. He kept up his rhythm, moving and thrusting.</p><p>Sighs and moans escaped her lips as his pace increased. And still, she did not look away.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t fucking,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fled the mirror and met his. The sapphire blue of his irises was barely visible against the wide, black pupils.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t fucking. It\u2019s a hell of a lot more.\u201d</p><p>His breathing stuttered as he thrust, his pace suddenly uneven.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d She began panting, her exhalations matching his rhythm.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something, but at that moment, she orgasmed. His words were drowned in a sea of sensation. Her eyes closed as the satisfaction flowed through her.</p><p>Gabriel thrust deep once more and released, his teeth nipping at her collarbone.</p><p>Julia struggled to catch her breath, resting her cheek against his neck.</p><p>\u201cIncredible,\u201d he rumbled, after he\u2019d caught his breath.</p><p>He lifted his head. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, resting her head against the wall. \u201cYes, but I\u2019m probably bowlegged. Give me a minute before you put me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m finished with you?\u201d</p><p>He pushed her hair behind her shoulder, his mouth finding her ear.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Julia awoke the next morning to an empty bed. Of itself, this was not surprising. But when she discovered that the bathroom and balcony were also empty, she pulled on her robe and went in search of her husband.</p><p>He was nowhere to be found.</p><p>The keys to the Mercedes were on the kitchen counter, where he\u2019d left them the night before, next to an empty bottle of Coca-Cola. He hadn\u2019t left a note.</p><p>A wave of hurt washed over her. The night before had been passionate, perhaps more so than any other night previous. They\u2019d made love against the wall, on the bathroom counter, on the floor, and finally on the bed. The sun was almost peeking over the horizon when he\u2019d finally relented and let them sleep.</p><p>Julia had wanted to wake up with him and perhaps, to take her time exploring his body before languorously making love. But such was not her good fortune. Gabriel\u2019s absence and the absence of a note made her feel twinges of anxiety. He hadn\u2019t even left a glass of water or juice at her bedside, as was his custom.</p><p>I wonder if this is how his other women felt after spending the night with him. If he even let them spend the night . . .</p><p>Her anxiety morphed into unhappiness as she reluctantly climbed the stairs and returned to her room. She changed into her bikini, grabbing her sunglasses and hat before walking to the pool. A swim would keep her occupied.</p><p>She swam laps until she\u2019d almost forgotten her conversation with her father the day before, and Gabriel\u2019s evident distress the previous evening. Then she set her feet down in the shallow end, her eyes straying to a pair of running shoes that were situated at the edge of the pool.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you I didn\u2019t want you swimming alone.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood, holding out a towel. He was dressed in his jogging clothes and he was sweaty, his T-shirt soaked.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you, too.\u201d She swam to the edge and plucked the towel from his grasp.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to swim alone if you didn\u2019t leave me,\u201d she muttered, climbing out of the pool.</p><p>\u201cYou know I like to run in the mornings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost noon.\u201d She wrapped herself in the towel and faced him, hands on her hips.</p><p>He seemed agitated. He glanced at her but wouldn\u2019t make eye contact, and his posture was decidedly uncomfortable.</p><p>Julia wondered how a night of fantastic sex could leave her relaxed and weightless and leave him strung as tightly as a bow.</p><p>\u201cYou could have left a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to run, that\u2019s fine. Just let me know when you\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel opened his mouth to protest but suddenly decided against it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have a shower. I made the hotel reservation for your father yesterday and arranged to have the concierge deliver a fruit basket. I\u2019ll be in my study for most of the day, working. But I\u2019ll take you to dinner in Todi tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Gabriel. You can\u2019t run off to your study after treating me so coldly. No.\u201d</p><p>His expression shifted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be cold, Julianne.\u201d His voice was low.</p><p>She stared at him.</p><p>He scrubbed at the stubble on his chin. \u201cI have a lot on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said last night. I hoped our activities would have helped.\u201d</p><p>A shadow passed over his features.</p><p>He stood in front of her, reaching out to grasp the necklace she was wearing. He ran his thumb over the suspended heart.</p><p>\u201cYou are always lovely. I could hold you in my arms and make love to you all day, but that wouldn\u2019t solve my problems.\u201d</p><p>Julia placed her hand over his. \u201cThen tell me you love me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She breathed out a heavy sigh. \u201cGo find your solution. But don\u2019t forget that you aren\u2019t the only person in the house. I don\u2019t want to live with a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes grew pained. He kissed her chastely, then exited the enclosed pool area.</p><p>True to his word, Gabriel spent the afternoon in his study, behind a closed door.</p><p>Julia had no idea what he was doing, although she hoped he was solving whatever problem it was that troubled him so deeply. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Several different scenarios flew through her head. Perhaps Paulina had contacted him, hurling him into a tailspin. Perhaps the revelation of her brother\u2019s illness had caused him to rethink his own desire for a child. Perhaps he was realizing that married life was not what he\u2019d hoped it would be\u2014that the thought of being tied to one woman, to her, was stifling.</p><p>Julia\u2019s anxiety increased. She could handle anything, she thought, but Gabriel\u2019s coldness. She\u2019d seen contempt in his eyes before. She\u2019d been dismissed from his presence. She\u2019d survived it once, but the mere thought of him leaving her again was crippling.</p><p>In an effort to turn her attention elsewhere, she sat at her computer, investigating the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and hypoplastic left heart syndrome.</p><p>The hospital\u2019s website gave her some hope. It described several patients who\u2019d received the surgery her little brother would have to have. But each patient testimonial included the caveat that no one, not even the specialists at the hospital, could predict how healthy the patients would be when they became children, teenagers, or adults.</p> <p>She said a silent prayer for her father and Diane, and, lastly, for her brother. She asked God to help him and to give him health.</p><p>Then her thoughts turned to her husband.</p><p>She prayed for him. She prayed for their marriage. She\u2019d thought their sexual activities the night before had brought them closer together and that they would free him to communicate with her.</p><p>Now she worried they\u2019d had the opposite effect. If Gabriel could communicate to her with his body, perhaps he failed to see the need to communicate with words.</p><p>With such thoughts in mind, she returned to her pediatric cardiology research, reading article after article, until the words blurred before her eyes and her head sank down against the chair\u2019s armrest.</p> <p>Julia awoke to the sensation that someone was watching her.</p><p>She was lying in bed. Seated next to her, his arms around his bent legs, was Gabriel. He regarded her from behind his glasses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She squinted at the clock that sat on the bedside table. It was past midnight.</p><p>\u201cI missed dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were exhausted. I kept you up too late last night.\u201d</p> <p>She yawned. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>He avoided her outstretched hand.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t I get a kiss?\u201d</p><p>He brushed his lips against hers in a manner that could only be described as perfunctory.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a very good kiss,\u201d she pouted. \u201cYou\u2019re perched on the edge of the bed like a gargoyle, glowering at me. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not glowering.\u201d</p><p>She sat up and placed her arms around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThen kiss me like you mean it, non-glowering-gargoyle-like husband of mine.\u201d</p> <p>His dark brows knitted together. \u201cA gargoyle? You\u2019re hell on a man\u2019s ego, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re far more beautiful than me, Professor. But I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blaspheme.\u201d His expression darkened.</p><p>She sank back against the mattress, groaning in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Gabriel. That means I\u2019ll put up with a hell of a lot from you. But I won\u2019t let you shut me out. Either talk to me or I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>She felt his eyes before she met them\u2014two glowing and angry sapphires in the nether darkness.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cIf I go and stay with my dad, he\u2019ll talk to me. I can take care of him and Diane when they get home from the hospital. You\u2019re acting as if you can\u2019t stand the sight of me.\u201d She rolled to her back, staring up at the canopy.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice.\u201d His voice was pained. \u201cIf you need to see your dad, we\u2019ll go together. But I would never let you make that trip alone. I\u2019ll be damned if you go home without me.\u201d</p><p>She hazarded a small smile.</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s the Gabriel I married. I thought I\u2019d lost you.\u201d She removed his glasses, placing them on the side table. Then she pulled him under the covers with her.</p><p>He rolled onto his side, facing her. Then, ever so lightly, he found her lips in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d She rested her head against his chest. \u201cTell me why you\u2019re so grim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to hear this right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You said you thought I wished you were someone else so I could fuck you.\u201d His tone grew sharp. \u201cNever say something like that to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t true. I swear to God, it isn\u2019t true. I left that life behind and God help me, I do not want to go back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you to go back there. I was hoping you\u2019d work out your bad mood with me, instead of sitting outside brooding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t fantasizing about fucking other women, I assure you.\u201d He sounded angry. \u201cAnd what we have is too important to cheapen.\u201d</p><p>She sat up swiftly.</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing cheap in what we did last night. We love each other. We\u2019d both received upsetting news. We needed comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was selfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was mutual. Remember? I wanted you. I needed you. If you were selfish, then so was I. But I don\u2019t see it that way. Yes, it was more aggressive and vigorous than we usually are. But you promised me I was safe with you. And I felt safe. You promised me we could be adventurous. Last night was one of our adventures. And in giving, we both received.\u201d</p><p>She tried to keep a straight face. But couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She smiled widely, trying to restrain a snicker.</p><p>In a flash, she was on her back and he was over her, their noses inches apart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think St. Francis would approve of you taking part of his prayer and applying it to our sexual activities,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cFrancis believed in love and in marriage. He\u2019d understand. At the very least, if he disapproved, he\u2019d be silent about it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel closed his eyes and shook his head. But a smile played across his mouth.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, they were tender.</p><p>\u201cI could live with you forever and still you would surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, Gabriel, because you\u2019re stuck with me. Even when you\u2019re in a foul mood. I\u2019m not ashamed of what we do with our bodies, because it also involves our souls. I don\u2019t want you to be ashamed either.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and kissed her reverently.</p><p>She kissed him back.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me that I\u2019m safe in your bed. But I want you to know that you\u2019re free in mine. All the baggage, all the things from our past, they don\u2019t matter here.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her jaw with his thumb. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow will you tell me why you were so upset last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d A shadow fell across his face. \u201cI just need a little time.\u201d He toyed with the diamonds in her ears. \u201cYou have my heart. Never doubt that.\u201d</p><p>Julia rested in his arms, but it was a long while before sleep claimed her.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>Julia was not a psychologist. She\u2019d spent time in therapy and was familiar with twelve-step programs and recovery. But she tried very hard not to diagnose others. In the case of her husband, she couldn\u2019t help herself. Something was troubling him. Something disturbing enough to cause him to return to his old coping mechanisms.</p><p>She suspected that whatever was upsetting him was related to the news they\u2019d received from Tom and Diane, but she wasn\u2019t certain. Correlation is not causality, and so it was possible that the two events were merely coincidental.</p><p>Without knowing what was wrong, she didn\u2019t know how to help him. Or how to comfort him. She felt as if a dark cloud hung over them, despite Gabriel\u2019s concerted attempts to behave as if nothing were wrong.</p><p>She knew better. And his unwillingness to share his burden wounded her.</p><p>As their time in Umbria drew to a close and they prepared to travel to Florence, she resolved to do her best to be supportive and loving. But she was determined that if he hadn\u2019t confided in her by the time they returned to Cambridge, she would take matters into her own hands.</p><p>During the previous summer, Gabriel had volunteered at the Franciscan orphanage in Florence during his separation from Julia. But as the staff quickly discerned, he was not the ideal volunteer. He didn\u2019t take direction, he gave it. He didn\u2019t hesitate to make changes to the workings of the orphanage, or to make demands about the facilities and food. And when the staff protested that they didn\u2019t have the money to implement his changes, he simply paid for them himself.</p><p>In sum, the director of the orphanage, Fra Silvestro, welcomed his donations but was relieved when the Franciscans over at Santa Croce persuaded Gabriel that his skills would be better utilized in leading tours and giving lectures on the life of Dante.</p><p>So it was with delight that Fra Silvestro welcomed Julia to the orphanage in August, hoping that she would moderate her husband\u2019s more aggressive charity.</p><p>When the Emersons arrived, they were met by the director; his assistant, Elena; and an assembly of children. The children, who ranged in age from four to eight, addressed Julia as Zia Julia and presented her with a bouquet and a series of drawings they\u2019d made. The illustrations were done in bright colors and featured smiling children and a woman with long, dark hair standing in the center.</p><p>For a moment, Gabriel was overwhelmed. In the eyes of the children, especially the older ones, he saw a glimpse of himself as a child. He remembered standing in the waiting room of the hospital in Sunbury after his mother died, trying to get something to eat from the vending machine. He didn\u2019t have any money and so he crawled on the ground to check under the machine for lost coins.</p><p>Gabriel tamped down the memory. If Grace hadn\u2019t come upon him that day, his life would have turned out very, very differently.</p><p>Julia greeted all the children, crouching down to their level. She seemed perfectly at ease, chattering and laughing with them in Italian.</p><p>After the introductions were made, the Emersons were led to a side yard where the rest of the orphanage\u2019s children, ages one to twelve, had gathered. The staff brought out the infants, so that they too could join the party.</p><p>Gabriel had been unable to rent a petting zoo but had secured the services of four ponies and their handlers. The ponies were tethered at the far end of the yard, surrounded by a crowd of excited children.</p><p>There were balloons and games, and a large, inflated bouncing castle. There were tables of food and desserts, and a large pyramid of wrapped gifts.</p><p>\u201cHow will they know which gift is for which child?\u201d Gabriel pondered aloud.</p><p>Julia glanced at the pyramid. \u201cI\u2019m sure each gift is labeled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t like the present they receive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElena asked the children what they wanted and we bought it.\u201d Julia squeezed his hand. \u201cStop fussing. The children will see you frowning and you\u2019ll scare them.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sniffed at being so maligned but cautiously adjusted his expression. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watched as she played games with the children, blowing bubbles and batting around balloons. A dark-haired, dark-eyed toddler took a shine to her, and soon Julia was carrying the boy on her hip and wresting her hair from his chubby fists, while avoiding a slight trickle of drool.</p><p>Gabriel was seized with a realization so strong it hurt.</p><p>Julianne was born to be a mother. She\u2019s loving and giving and patient. She has what my biological mother lacked, and what Grace had in abundance.</p><p>Maybe she even has enough to compensate for my own shortcomings.</p> <p>To keep his melancholy at bay, Gabriel helped with the ponies, lifting children on and off their saddles. Julia had been correct. The ponies were the highlight of the event. Children lined up to pet and feed them in between rides.</p><p>When it was time to hand out presents, Gabriel stood behind the gift table with Julia.</p><p>Brother Silvestro made an announcement to the children, thanking Zio and Zia Emerson for their generosity. Gabriel and Julia nodded to polite applause. Then Julia began handing out the presents, still holding on to the toddler.</p><p>Gabriel would have joined her, but a little boy pulled at his trousers in an effort to secure his attention.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d said Gabriel, in Italian. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you him?\u201d the boy asked.</p><p>\u201cAm I whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuperman.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gave the child a puzzled smile. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m Superman?\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou look like him. Can I see under your shirt?\u201d The boy pointed to Gabriel\u2019s white oxford button-down.</p><p>He smiled wryly. \u201cI don\u2019t have my suit on today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing Clark Kent\u2019s glasses.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel removed his glasses and frowned at them. He thought his Prada frames were a good deal smarter than the horrific pair that Clark Kent wore.</p><p>(Perhaps he\u2019d been mistaken.)</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t have time to be offended, however, because as soon as he took off the glasses, the boy gasped. A small crowd of other children soon gathered around.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Superman,\u201d the first boy whispered, triumphantly.</p><p>Gabriel replaced his glasses, then reached out to ruffle the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not Superman. I\u2019m Zio Gabriel from America. Zia Julia is my wife.\u201d</p><p>The children looked over at Julia, who was continuing to call out names and dispense brightly colored presents. She caught their eyes and smiled prettily.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Lois Lane.\u201d A little voice piped up.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said the first boy. \u201cWe recognize her. That\u2019s Lois Lane.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel examined Julia with new eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought Lois was taller,\u201d he mused, half to himself.</p><p>\u201cI have a picture. See?\u201d A boy held up a comic book and pointed to the drawing of Lois Lane on the cover. \u201cIt\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cut her hair,\u201d said another boy, eyeing Julia with disappointment. \u201cI liked it longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Gabriel muttered.</p><p>\u201cCan you do any tricks?\u201d a girl interjected.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of tricks?\u201d The Professor fought to hide his amusement.</p><p>\u201cLift something heavy, see through walls, fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, fly!\u201d The children began to jump up and down.</p><p>The Professor looked at the ever-increasing crowd of youngsters moving around him and sighed. He held his hands out to quiet them.</p><p>Then he leaned forward, dropping his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows Clark Kent is Superman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said one of the boys, lifting his hand high in the air.</p><p>Gabriel grinned. \u201cYes, you know. But none of the adults know. Lois and I are here for the party. So I need you all to help us keep this a secret. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Some of the children gazed at him skeptically, but many of them nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow Lois has a present for all of you. Why don\u2019t you go over and say hello and pick up your gift?\u201d</p><p>With a somewhat mixed reaction, the children began to disperse, soon distracted by other pursuits.</p><p>Julia, who had been half-listening to the exchange nearby, caught his eye and winked.</p><p>Superman? she mouthed.</p><p>He shook his head. He\u2019d been called a lot of things in his thirty-five years, but no one had ever accused him of being Superman. Although he had to admit, Julia would make a damn fine Lois Lane.</p><p>He wondered if there was a costume shop in Florence that he could visit.</p><p>He was contemplating that (and other naughty things) when he felt someone\u2019s eyes on him. He looked down and saw a small blond girl. She had her fingers in her mouth and was staring up at him.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cCiao, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>She took her fingers out of her mouth and extended her arms.</p><p>At first, he didn\u2019t understand what she wanted. She lifted her arms higher and waved them slightly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asking you to pick her up, Man of Steel.\u201d Julia was suddenly beside him.</p><p>Gabriel lifted the girl into his arms and she smiled briefly before placing her fingers back in her mouth.</p><p>It was at this moment that Julia\u2019s eyes met his and a long look passed between them. She greeted the child and patted her on the back. Then she returned to the gift table.</p><p>\u201cMaria doesn\u2019t speak.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel turned to face Elena, Brother Silvestro\u2019s most capable assistant.</p><p>Elena reached out to tuck a blond curl behind the child\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019m surprised she went to you. She usually avoids strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is she?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d Elena switched to English. \u201cBut she hasn\u2019t spoken since she arrived almost a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much trauma.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked at the cherubic face of the child and suppressed a series of curses.</p><p>\u201cWill she ever speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hope so. She needs a family, certainly.\u201d</p><p>Unconsciously, Gabriel held the child more closely.</p><p>\u201cIs it difficult to find families?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d Elena smiled at Maria and spoke Italian, asking if she was enjoying the party.</p><p>Maria nodded and pointed in the direction of the ponies.</p><p>\u201cAh. I think you would like a pony ride. Shall I?\u201d Elena gestured as if to take the girl, but Gabriel shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the ponies and asked her in Italian which one was her favorite. She pointed to the smallest one, a black pony with white patches on his coat. He had a braided tail with a red ribbon tied to the end of it. He was called Cioccolato.</p><p>Carefully, Gabriel placed Maria on the saddle and rested his hand on her back while the pony\u2019s owner began to lead them in a circle.</p><p>Maria smiled and clutched the pony\u2019s mane between her tiny fingers.</p><p>As Gabriel walked the circuit with the child and the pony, he mused on the fact that his life could have turned out very differently. He was not an orphan, but a man with a family. And he had a family because Grace and Richard had opened their home and their hearts to him.</p><p>Although the darkness that was currently eating away at him had not abated, he found himself grateful for the hope that had shone in his life. And he vowed to share that hope with others. Somehow.</p><p>Julia watched her husband with the crowd of children and later, with the little girl, and found herself transfixed. Something about the sight of a tall, handsome man explaining why he wasn\u2019t Superman warmed her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had many opportunities to watch Gabriel interact with children. She never accompanied him on his volunteer work at the Italian Home for Children. She\u2019d seen him interact with Quinn, of course, but only on a few occasions.</p><p>Seeing how Gabriel was protective and sweet with Maria tugged at her heart.</p><p>The Professor was intimidating. He had his moments when he could be cold and prim. Certainly, there were times such as when she\u2019d found him smoking on the balcony in Umbria when she worried about him. But the surprising gentleness with which he treated children made her wonder what he would be like with their child. He\u2019d ruffle their son\u2019s hair and talk about Superman. He\u2019d carry their daughter in his arms and treat her like a princess.</p><p>As she saw Gabriel smiling and chattering to the silent child, Julia realized that what Tammy had told her was true\u2014children bring out a special side of a good man.</p><p>And Julia desperately wanted to give Gabriel that opportunity.</p><p>Someday.</p><p>At the end of what had been a fulfilling but long day, Julia sat with Gabriel on the terrace of their favorite room at the Gallery Hotel Art. The terrace and the room itself held so many memories for them. It was the place Julia had given him her virginity, and the place he returned to when he felt himself in danger of succumbing to his addictions after their separation.</p><p>He was lying on the banquette, hands behind his head, looking up at the star-studded sky. She was next to him, sipping a glass of San Pellegrino.</p><p>\u201cYou could have wine,\u201d he said, pointing to her glass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with water, Superman.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. \u201cThat was an interesting conversation. I\u2019ve been called a lot of things in my life. But no one has ever called me Superman.\u201d</p><p>She ran her fingers up and down his arm.</p><p>\u201cOnly because they haven\u2019t got the nerve. I rather like the idea of you being the handsome but slightly nerdy professor by day, and the sexy Man of Steel by night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say about calling me a nerd?\u201d Gabriel caught her wrist, pulling her so she was lying half on him.</p><p>The water sloshed in her glass, so he took it from her, setting it aside.</p><p>He brought their noses together.</p><p>\u201cI can show you some steel tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI never thought of you as Lois Lane before. But there\u2019s a remarkable likeness.\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled her eyes heavenward. \u201cAll this time, I thought you were in love with Beatrice, when really, it was Lois Lane. I need to switch literary genres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. But a little role-playing might be interesting, Miss Lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to have a Halloween party so we can dress up.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel traced the line of her jaw with his finger.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait until Halloween.\u201d</p><p>A thrill coursed up her spine at his tone.</p><p>\u201cI look forward to that. Did you have a good time at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He released her, his gaze returning to the stars.</p><p>She sighed, picking up her glass again. She sipped the water as she contemplated how to broach the subject.</p><p>\u201cSomething happened today, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to comment further, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>She put her drink on the table and went to him, placing her arm atop his abdomen.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>Her heart sank. \u201cThe list of things you won\u2019t share with me is becoming longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy silence isn\u2019t meant to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d She huffed in frustration. \u201cHow can I be your partner when you won\u2019t talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulianne, I\u2019m going to talk to you. I promise I won\u2019t do anything without discussing it with you. I just need to\u2014figure out a few things first.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t you figure them out with me? I\u2019m a good listener. I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a good listener. The best. But sometimes a man needs to do things alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that man-speak for \u2018Don\u2019t worry your pretty little head, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan-speak?\u201d He chuckled, pressing his lips to her palm. \u201cYou\u2019re adorable.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled away, crossing her arms in front of her chest. \u201cNow is not a good time to be patronizing, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>He rolled to his side and kissed the wrinkle between her eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m not patronizing you. You are adorable.\u201d He paused, his eyes focused and intense. \u201cYou need to be a mother. Seeing you with the children\u2014how loving and at ease you are. You\u2019re a natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday was a special day. Your ponies were a hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right, as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so sad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand to leave them there.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s eyes and tone evidenced his distress.</p><p>Julia observed him, realizing that whatever distress he felt at the orphanage had been very well hidden.</p><p>\u201cThe children are treated nicely. The staff love them. They\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still an orphanage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Julia pushed a curl back from his forehead. She ran her fingers through his hair in an attempt to soothe him.</p><p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s like,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhen my mother died, there were several months when I didn\u2019t know where I\u2019d end up. It could have been an orphanage or foster care. I could have been shipped back to New York to live with my mother\u2019s family. I was in limbo, never knowing if someone was going to show up to take me away or if Grace and Richard were going to tire of me and pack my bags.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey would never have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. They were strangers to me. I wasn\u2019t especially adoptable. My father disowned me, and my mother\u2019s family didn\u2019t want me. They would have left me to an orphanage\u2014my own flesh and blood. Now do you understand why I don\u2019t want anything to do with them?\u201d</p><p>Julia placed her hand against his face. \u201cYes. But you were very adoptable. Grace and Richard were attached to you from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t taken me, what would have happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in going down that road. You have a family that loves you and you have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re everything, Julianne.\u201d</p><p>The beauty of his words pierced her heart. She leaned forward to kiss him, trying to show how much his words meant to her.</p><p>When she pulled away, he grasped her hand at the wrist. \u201cWe could adopt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you wanted to try to have a child first.\u201d</p><p>He looked away.</p><p>\u201cHas something changed?\u201d she pressed, noting his body language.</p><p>\u201cChildren like Maria deserve a home. She doesn\u2019t even speak!\u201d Gabriel became visibly agitated.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should try to help Elena find a family for her. You know lots of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we take her?\u201d</p><p>Julia searched his eyes, surprised to discover that he was serious.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, we aren\u2019t in the best position to take home a toddler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love each other and we\u2019d love her. We have a house and a yard. We speak Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaria is a toddler with special needs and we\u2019re first-time parents. I\u2019m already worried about making mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sat up. \u201cHow could you make a mistake? You are everything that is good and gentle. Children are drawn to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you had help? I\u2019m owed a sabbatical. That was part of my agreement with BU when I left Toronto.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave him an incredulous look. \u201cYou\u2019d use your sabbatical to stay home with me and a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Children aren\u2019t awake all the time. We could take turns. You have to admit that having an extra pair of hands would make things easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one of us knows very much about caring for a toddler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. \u201cRebecca is wonderful, but she\u2019s our housekeeper, not a nanny. Her kids are grown up. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d want to help us with a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d be surprised if you asked her. She\u2019s already volunteered to help more when we have a baby.\u201d</p><p>Julia pulled away from him. \u201cYou\u2019ve spoken to her about this?\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up. \u201cNo. But before we were married, she mentioned that she hoped she\u2019d be with us for a long time, long enough to see us start a family.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not the enemy, Julianne. I\u2019m not constantly looking for ways to sabotage your education. Or your life.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I feel as if the slightest disturbance will cause me to lose my focus and I\u2019ll flunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the most honest thing you\u2019ve said about your program.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her face, eyes narrowing. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means, darling, that you\u2019re worried about failing. Even though so many people are eager to support and help you. Including me and Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>She started to protest, but he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cAnxiety over starting a family is legitimate. But I think you\u2019d be anxious about your program anyway. That has more to do with how you see yourself than how you see the program.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I know, I felt the same way when I was at Harvard. I think anyone who has an accurate sense of self has the same concern.\u201d He moved his hand to the back of her neck, urging her forward. \u201cYou can do it, Julianne. I believe in you.\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked at the back of her eyes and she found herself in his arms, clutching him tightly.</p><p>He moved his mouth to her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take Maria home with us. I\u2019d like to take all the kids home with us. But this thing with Harvard is something you need to deal with on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you won\u2019t tell me what\u2019s troubling you?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel exhaled loudly.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m still working things out in my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll share it with you eventually. As I said in Umbria, I won\u2019t do anything without discussing it with you first. I just need some time.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head but elected not to argue with him.</p><p>\u201cWill you continue your work with the Italian Home for Children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They need me, of course, and I\u2019ve promised the students that if they graduate high school with an excellent grade point average that I\u2019ll send them to Italy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already changing the lives of children. You should be proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a half-smile. \u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t ready for adoption? We\u2019d love her.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were dark with emotion.</p><p>Julia thought back to what she\u2019d seen that day\u2014the way Gabriel was with Maria and the other children. At that moment, Julia truly wanted to give him what he was asking for. But she knew it was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWe would. But if we love her, we need to do what\u2019s best for her. And that\u2019s probably finding a local family. Not two American newlyweds who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. You\u2019d have to give up smoking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d He looked at her carefully. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about the drugs, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed and he frowned at her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to have a lot of confidence in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have every confidence in you. But you have to remember that I watched my mother relapse more than once.\u201d</p><p>He disentangled himself from her arms. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to relapse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should talk about your own relapses. Just last month you were struggling with something and you turned to Paul.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s brown eyes flashed. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to throw that back in my face. I apologized, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cAre we having an honest and open conversation? Or are you trying to manipulate me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel glared. \u201cWe\u2019re having an honest and open conversation. I apologize for bringing up Paul.\u201d</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>\u201cI understand that it\u2019s difficult to work with the children at the orphanage and to leave them there. I feel it too. But it isn\u2019t in Maria\u2019s best interest for us to take her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe orphanage is good, but it isn\u2019t the same thing as having a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly why we shouldn\u2019t take her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel moved to his feet. \u201cThat is not the Julianne I know speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes it is.\u201d She stood in front of him.</p><p>\u201cThe Julianne I know would give the clothes off her back to a homeless person.\u201d</p><p>She took a step closer, her face flushed with anger.</p><p>\u201cI would give the clothes off my back for Maria. But I want her to be with a family who are stable and experienced when it comes to children. She\u2019s been traumatized. Taking her to a place where she doesn\u2019t know the language, away from her city and her friends, would only upset her. We\u2019d be hurting, not helping. And I won\u2019t let you do that. And I don\u2019t care if you think that I\u2019m being a coldhearted bitch or whatever the hell you have running through your mind.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a reproachful look before retreating to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he shouted, picking up her glass of water and throwing it.</p><p>The glass shattered against the floor of the terrace.</p><p>From a distance, Gabriel heard the door to the bathroom slam shut.</p><p>He placed his hands on the balcony, leaning against the edge, and hung his head.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>August 2011</p><p>Washington, D.C.</p><p>Senator Talbot\u2019s son Simon stood to his feet and quickly pulled on his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my shirt?\u201d He looked in vain for the light blue polo that perfectly matched the color of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the chair.\u201d His girlfriend, Natalie, sat up, not bothering to clutch the sheet to her chest.</p><p>As usual, his eyes dropped to her breasts, which had been surgically enhanced the year previous. He placed a knee on the bed.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m glad I bought these.\u201d He dropped his head and drew one of her nipples into his mouth, sucking it strongly before biting with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d She reached out to palm him through his jeans, but he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cI have to go. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d He located his shirt and pulled it over his head before hastily retrieving his shoes and socks.</p><p>\u201cWhen will I see you?\u201d She knelt behind him and pressed her lips to his neck. With a single finger, she traced his jaw, gliding over the scars that were the result of his one and only violent encounter with Gabriel Emerson. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook her off. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She sat back on her heels repentantly. \u201cNo one notices them. I think they make you look rugged.\u201d</p><p>He turned, his eyes glacial pools.</p><p>She tilted her head to one side. \u201cWhen will I see you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to cool off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut things have been going well. I work for your father now, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told him we were casual. That was his condition for hiring you. I can\u2019t be seen going in and out of your apartment anymore. People are watching.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen we can meet at a hotel.\u201d She reached for him but caught only air.</p><p>Simon walked toward the bedroom door. \u201cHe wants me to take Senator Hudson\u2019s daughter to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She leapt from the bed. She stood in front of him, naked, her green eyes sparking with anger and her long, red hair a riotous mess.</p><p>Simon placed one of his hands on the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get hysterical.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the coldness of his voice. \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He stroked his thumb along the curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I don\u2019t like it when you get hysterical.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hand to her ass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just dinner. She finished her junior year at Duke and she\u2019s here for the summer. I\u2019m going to take her out and, hopefully, persuade her to put a good word in for my dad with her father. We could use his endorsement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fuck her?\u201d</p><p>Simon snorted. \u201cAre you kidding? She\u2019s a virgin. I had enough of that shit dealing with Julia.\u201d</p><p>Natalie wrinkled her nose at the mention of her former roommate.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think the Hudson girl is a virgin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer family is religious. They\u2019re from the South. It\u2019s a guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReligion didn\u2019t keep Jules from going down on you.\u201d Natalie crossed her arms in front of her.</p><p>\u201cKeep your mouth shut about Julia. I don\u2019t need her asshole boyfriend fucking things up for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s her asshole husband now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what he is. You know the score.\u201d Simon pulled her closer. \u201cDon\u2019t bring them up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think I feel? My boyfriend is being set up with another goody two-shoes because his father thinks I\u2019m a whore.\u201d</p><p>Simon gripped her ass with both hands.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re finally getting what we want. We just need to wait until after the election.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can be patient.\u201d She dropped to her knees in front of him, quickly freeing him from the confines of his jeans. \u201cBut I think you need a reminder of who you\u2019re walking out on.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-five</p><p>Florence, Italy</p><p>Gabriel smoked a lonely cigarette out on the terrace, staring at the shards of a broken water glass. He\u2019d upset Julianne.</p><p>She\u2019d seen him throw things before. He\u2019d murdered her old cell phone when that motherfucker Simon called her.</p><p>Gabriel inhaled, drawing the air deep into his lungs before exhaling through his nostrils.</p><p>He did not think of their relationship as tempestuous. Although they\u2019d had more conflict recently. They\u2019d fought back in Selinsgrove over her paper. They\u2019d fought in Umbria when he\u2019d asked about her mother and she\u2019d told him he was mindfucking her.</p><p>Tonight they\u2019d descended to a new low when she accused him of thinking she was a bitch. Nothing was further from the truth. He couldn\u2019t even place the word and her name in the same sentence.</p><p>But he\u2019d lost his temper before he had the chance to say that.</p><p>His secrets were hurting her. He knew that. But he couldn\u2019t unburden himself until he\u2019d found a solution. He didn\u2019t want to appear weak and undecided, or worse, to watch her compassion change into pity. He\u2019d rather alienate her temporarily than lose her respect.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t found a way forward. Not yet. He was caught between two extremes, both of which were unacceptable. At the moment he lacked the courage or the wisdom to find a middle path.</p><p>He finished his cigarette and lit another one. Perhaps he lacked both courage and wisdom.</p><p>Julianne was correct. If they adopted a child, he\u2019d have to quit. He\u2019d quit cigarettes before, after his stint in rehab. He could quit again.</p><p>He thought about Tom and Diane. They\u2019d gone from the elation of discovering they were expecting to the devastation of learning that their child had a life-threatening birth defect. He couldn\u2019t imagine how powerless they felt. He\u2019d had a glimpse of such impotence when Paulina\u2014</p><p>Gabriel forced himself to focus on the cigarette he held between his fingers. He couldn\u2019t allow his mind to wander down that road. Not tonight.</p><p>He gazed at the skyline of Florence, at the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio, waiting until he was sure Julia was asleep.</p><p>He visited the bathroom, brushing his teeth and dropping his clothes to the floor. He showered quickly, knowing that she\u2019d smell the smoke on his skin.</p><p>Naked and with damp hair, he slid between the sheets. He didn\u2019t touch her. A quick glimpse of the bed in the lamplight revealed that she was wearing a nightgown and curled on her side, facing away from him.</p><p>Message received, sweetheart.</p><p>As he settled into bed he thought, perhaps, that he heard a murmur of distress emanating from her direction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he switched off the light and turned his back to her.</p><p>It only took a moment for Julia to shift so she was spooning him from behind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe promised we wouldn\u2019t go to bed angry anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry, Gabriel, I\u2019m hurt.\u201d</p><p>He reached back to grasp her wrist and pulled her arm so that it draped over his waist. \u201cYou\u2019re right about Maria. I just wanted to do something.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bitch. I\u2019d never think of you that way. You\u2019re my beloved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I need you to be kind to me. I have to tell you, Gabriel, this past little while has been really difficult. I don\u2019t want our marriage to be like this.\u201d</p><p>His body tightened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to make it up to you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to make it up to me. Just tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now.\u201d Her tone was harsh.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Julianne,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m asking you, please, to give me a little more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can come to some momentous decision without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do anything without talking to you first. But haven\u2019t you ever been worried about something and tried to figure out how to deal with it? You can\u2019t exactly make those decisions for me.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m asking you, Julianne, to have a little compassion.\u201d</p><p>She searched his eyes and found nothing insincere in them.</p><p>\u201cI can give you a little more time. But I want you to call Dr. Townsend.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel opened his mouth to protest but was interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t accept your refusal. Either tell me what\u2019s troubling you, or tell him. But for both our sakes, Gabriel, tell someone.\u201d</p><p>With a deep exhalation, he nodded.</p><p>Gabriel was awake before sunrise and quit the suite before Julianne awoke. Though it pained him to leave the warmth of her embrace, he was on a mission. The sooner he gathered the information he needed, the closer he would be to a solution.</p><p>(Or so he hoped.)</p><p>That afternoon, he had an important meeting scheduled with his old friend, Dottore Vitali, the director of the Uffizi Gallery. Now Gabriel was more determined than ever to show his wife how much he loved her. And to do so publicly.</p><p>As he exited the hotel, he reflected on the fact that he preferred Florence in the morning\u2014the quiet of the streets before the city shook off its slumber.</p><p>He stopped at the caf\u00e9 at the Gucci Museum in Piazza della Signoria and bought an espresso and a sweet roll. He enjoyed his breakfast outside, along with his newspaper, La Nazione, biding his time until he could call for Elena at the orphanage.</p><p>At ten o\u2019clock, he rang the doorbell. Elena was surprised to see him and even more surprised when he revealed the reason for his visit.</p><p>She thanked him for his concern for Maria and suggested that if he wanted to help, he could assist in covering the costs for the therapist she was seeing in an effort to help her recover her speech.</p><p>When Gabriel raised the subject of adoption, Elena quickly explained that adopting a child in Italy could be difficult. Only married couples were permitted to adopt, and they must have been married for at least three years. Even if he and Julianne had decided to adopt Maria, the Italian government wouldn\u2019t let them.</p><p>Gabriel left the orphanage duly chastened, but not without making a substantial donation to cover Maria\u2019s expenses. He made it clear that Elena was to contact him if any needs arose.</p><p>Lost in thought, he wandered to a caf\u00e9 at Santa Croce. Instead of watching the beautiful women walk by, he made a few phone calls, prevailing upon Florence\u2019s finer families to consider supporting the orphanage through foster care or adoption.</p><p>Reactions were mixed. Everyone was willing to part with their money for charity, but not a single couple would agree to become foster parents. Adoption was absolutely out of the question.</p><p>Once again, Gabriel was confronted with the lavishness of grace as he contemplated all the reasons why Richard and Grace could have said no to adopting him, but didn\u2019t.</p><p>Julianne awoke to an empty bed and a quiet hotel room. But Gabriel had left a glass of water on the nightstand, along with a note,</p><p>Darling,</p><p>I\u2019ve gone to run errands.</p><p>I\u2019ll be back in time to get ready for the exhibition opening tonight.</p><p>I love you,</p><p>And I like my body when it is with your body,</p><p>G.</p><p>On the back of the note, Gabriel had transcribed a poem by e. e. cummings: \u201ci like my body when it is with your.\u201d</p><p>Julia read and reread the poem, wondering what Gabriel\u2019s errands were.</p><p>In truth, she felt guilty. Gabriel was correct\u2014Maria needed a family to love and care for her. Julia could see why Gabriel was drawn to her.</p><p>As all the anxiety about graduate school and her career washed over her, she couldn\u2019t shake the suspicion that she was being selfish by valuing her education over the welfare of a child.</p><p>Still, it didn\u2019t seem right to take Maria from the only country she\u2019d ever known and place her in a house with strangers. Especially since Julia didn\u2019t know what Gabriel was troubled about.</p><p>Maybe he wants children right away and he\u2019s gearing himself up to tell me so.</p><p>Julia entertained the thought but put it aside. Gabriel recognized her anxiety about grad school. He wasn\u2019t going to add to it.</p><p>She\u2019d worked so hard to get herself to this point. His remarks the evening before about \u201cthe Julianne he knew\u201d had cut her deeply. She\u2019d tried to be compassionate her whole life. Surely being a good person didn\u2019t entail the abandonment of one\u2019s dreams. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Much as she wanted to help Maria, she simply couldn\u2019t agree to adopt her. Not now. Perhaps in two years when they were better acquainted with her, and Julia was in her fourth year of graduate school. The fourth year was devoted to preparing her dissertation prospectus and then writing her dissertation. Julia could simply work on her research and be a mother, at the same time.</p><p>(Or so she thought.)</p><p>Still, she worried about her husband\u2014about what secret demons tormented him and why he was so determined to be secretive.</p><p>She lifted her iPhone from the nightstand and quickly sent him a text.</p> <p>G,</p><p>I missed waking up with you this morning.</p><p>Thank you for your note and the poem.</p><p>Looking forward to the opening tonight.</p><p>I love you too,</p> <p>J.</p><p>xo</p><p>Then, in an effort to exercise her compassion, she dressed and spent the day on her own quest\u2014trying to find the homeless man she\u2019d given money to during her first visit to Florence with Gabriel.</p><p>She searched the city center, but no one seemed to know the man she was referring to, and certainly none of the people she asked had seen a man answering his description.</p><p>While Julianne was burying her sorrows in a lemon gelato at Bar Perseo, Gabriel was finishing his meeting with Dottore Massimo Vitali at the Uffizi. He returned to the hotel to find an empty suite, but the scent of orange blossoms filled the air, remnants of her perfume.</p><p>He had happy memories of their first visit to Florence. There was a wall in the suite that he would have liked to enshrine. He thought back to the early days of their relationship and how he\u2019d worked so hard to earn Julianne\u2019s trust. He was seized of a sudden by a glimpse of what his life would be like without her\u2014empty, naked, cold.</p> <p>He had to deal with his problems head on, or the gap between them would grow ever wider until eventually, he lost her.</p><p>He picked up his phone and dialed the number for his therapist\u2019s office. Then he left a long message.</p><p>After he\u2019d hung up the phone, he opened his laptop and pulled up the Google search engine. He typed the following search phrase: \u201cOwen Davies.\u201d</p><p>A few hours later, Julia was standing in the bathroom, applying makeup, while Gabriel stood at the sink next to her, shaving. As her fingers stroked over part of her throat, she found herself wincing. She could no longer see where Simon had bitten her. But every time she touched the spot, she felt his teeth.</p><p>A gentle hand caressed the back of her neck. \u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>She met Gabriel\u2019s eyes in the mirror. \u201cI wish I could believe that. Somehow I suspect he and Natalie aren\u2019t finished with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d He kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p> <p>Something flickered across his features, but it was eclipsed by his smile.</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard from my dad today.\u201d She traced the marble topped vanity with her finger.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to get married Labor Day weekend. It will be a small wedding. Dad feels more comfortable with Diane at his place and Diane doesn\u2019t want to move in with him without being married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing has changed. Diane seems to be doing well, and the baby is about as good as could be expected. They\u2019re keeping an eye on both of them.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cDad feels pretty helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he does. He wants to protect them and there\u2019s nothing he can do.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, looking down at the marble with a fascination unwarranted by its appearance. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Maria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d He leaned against the vanity, contemplating his bare feet. \u201cBut at least I tried to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe one of the families you contacted will change their mind. If they could just meet her, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d fall in love with her.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, wriggling his toes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say that I understand, Gabriel, because I don\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t adopted and so I don\u2019t share that special affinity you have with the children at the orphanage. But if you could just give me until my fourth year, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have plenty of time to talk about that. There\u2019s no rush.\u201d He smiled at her gently.</p><p>A feeling of relief mixed with dread washed over her.</p><p>Gabriel returned to his shaving, while she watched with rapt fascination.</p><p>\u201cThis reminds me of our first trip to Florence. We were getting ready together before going to the Uffizi.\u201d She seemed wistful. \u201cI was just your girlfriend, then.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stopped.</p><p>\u201cYou were never just my girlfriend, Julianne. You were my lover. And we\u2019re still lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d She gestured in the direction of the bedroom, pausing for a moment to remember their first time together. \u201cI was so happy here.</p><p>\u201cBut tonight I\u2019m going to accompany you to the Uffizi as your wife. We get to open the exhibition of your illustrations together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re our illustrations. And I love you even more now than I did before. I didn\u2019t think it was possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you more, too.\u201d She peered down at her toes, admiring the way the red nail polish shimmered in the light. \u201cI think your love has healed me, in many ways.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel placed his razor on the counter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you persist in being sweet when I\u2019m shaving.\u201d He tried not to get shaving cream on her silk robe, but failed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to have sex now.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWe can\u2019t. We\u2019re due at the Uffizi at seven. The guests of honor can\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do for one of the guests of honor to be cross all evening because he\u2019s hard and wanting. We had a fight. We made up. You owe me makeup sex.\u201d</p><p>Julia reached out a hand to test his arousal.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to be uncomfortable, Professor. But I really need to get ready. Look at my hair.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back to see the dark strands, which were now streaked with shaving cream on one side.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he huffed. \u201cBut don\u2019t be surprised if I spirit you off to a corridor and have my way with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it, Superman.\u201d She nipped his ear with her teeth before escaping his arms. \u201cAnd just for the record, I like my body when it\u2019s with yours, as well.\u201d</p><p>A short while later, Julia exited the washroom, walking over to where Gabriel was seated in the living area of their suite.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He stood up and removed his glasses, tossing aside the book he\u2019d been reading.</p><p>He took her hand, spinning her in a circle. Her Valentino dress was very feminine, with a boat neckline, cap sleeves, a slim bodice, and a full skirt. The fabric was a rich red taffeta.</p><p>She pulled at the hemline, which sat above her knees. \u201cI think I should have bought something black, instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His eyes traveled from her exposed collarbones, across her breasts and down to her long and shapely legs. \u201cRed is perfect.\u201d</p><p>He peered down at her black Prada peep-toe stilettos.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been holding out on me, Mrs. Emerson. I don\u2019t recall seeing those before.\u201d</p><p>She arched an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one with secrets, Professor.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s smile slid off his face.</p><p>She looked down at her shoes.</p><p>\u201cBut I can arrange a private viewing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a dark corner at the Uffizi?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met and she nodded.</p><p>He kissed her cheek. \u201cYou look lovely. The guests won\u2019t be looking at Botticelli. They\u2019ll be looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t say that, Gabriel. I\u2019m nervous enough.\u201d She brushed imaginary lint from his shoulders and then straightened his black bow tie. \u201cYou\u2019re handsome. I don\u2019t have the pleasure of seeing you in a tuxedo very often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can arrange a private viewing.\u201d He pressed his lips to the inside of her wrist, closing his eyes and inhaling her scent.</p><p>\u201cRoses.\u201d He opened his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed your perfume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Noble Rose of Afghanistan. It\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s fair trade and it encourages development in that country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you would choose your perfume because of the company\u2019s commitment to fair trade. What did I do to deserve you?\u201d Gabriel whispered, his eyes dark and searching.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve happiness. Why can\u2019t you let yourself believe that?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a long look, then took her hand in his and led her to the door.</p><p>All the while, Julia\u2019s heart nearly cracked under the weight of her realization that her love had not healed him.</p><p>\u201cProfessore. Signora.\u201d Lorenzo, Dottore Vitali\u2019s assistant, greeted them at the entrance to the Uffizi.</p><p>\u201cWe shall gather with the media. You will be invited to open the exhibition. Then we will view the collection, enjoy a reception and later, dinner.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel acquiesced in Italian, squeezing Julia\u2019s hand.</p><p>Lorenzo led them to a hallway where a crowd of about a hundred people were gathered. Julia recognized many familiar faces from Gabriel\u2019s lecture a year and a half ago. All the men were in tuxedos, save the members of the press; all the women were wearing gowns, many of which swept the floor.</p><p>Julia looked down at her bare legs self-consciously.</p><p>Soon they were surrounded. Gabriel shook hands and exchanged pleasantries, introducing Julia as his beautiful wife. She watched as he greeted guests in Italian, French, and German, working the room fluidly and comfortably. But he never let her leave his side; his arm remained wrapped around her waist.</p><p>They were just about to follow Dottore Vitali to the doorway to the exhibition when Julia stopped short. Staring at her, not fifty feet away, was Professor Pacciani, with a tall, dark-haired woman on his arm.</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>For a moment, she thought the woman was Christa Peterson. But on sustained inspection, she realized that although there was a resemblance, Pacciani\u2019s companion was older than Christa by about ten years.</p><p>Gabriel felt Julia stop, but he\u2019d been speaking with Vitali, getting last-minute instructions on what was to take place. His eyes followed hers and something akin to a growl escaped his chest.</p><p>\u201cAh, you know Professor Pacciani, I assume.\u201d Vitali spoke in Gabriel\u2019s ear. \u201cWe invited the professors from the universities, on your instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d said Gabriel. He rued the fact that he hadn\u2019t been more explicit about who should not receive an invitation.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Dottore Vitali gestured, and the Emersons walked to the doorway.</p><p>They stood side by side, facing the crowd and blinking amid the cameras and commotion, while Vitali made his introductions. Julia tried not to fidget, but she felt very conspicuous.</p><p>The director spent a long time explaining the history of the sixteenth-century illustrations\u2014how they were copies of Botticelli\u2019s original images of Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy, and how, although eight of the originals had been lost, the Emersons had possession of the full complement of one hundred. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Julia scanned the crowd, one face stood out. A young-looking, fair-haired man with strange gray eyes stared unblinkingly in her direction, his expression one of intense curiosity. His reaction was so different from the other guests, Julia couldn\u2019t help but return his stare, until Gabriel nudged her, drawing her attention back to their host.</p><p>Dottore Vitali painstakingly traced the provenance of the illustrations from the Emersons back to the nineteenth century, where they seem to have appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>The Uffizi was proud to display images that had not been viewed in public since, perhaps, their creation.</p><p>The audience murmured appreciatively and broke out into enthusiastic applause as Vitali thanked the Emersons for their generosity.</p> <p>Gabriel moved his arm in order to take Julia\u2019s hand, squeezing it. They nodded and smiled their acknowledgments. Then he walked to the podium and offered a few words of thanks in Italian to Vitali and the Uffizi.</p><p>He turned his body sideways, his eyes fixed on Julia\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention my wife, Julianne. The lovely lady you see before you is the reason why this evening came about. Without her, I would have kept the illustrations to myself. Through her words and her deeds, she has shown me what it is to be charitable and good.\u201d</p><p>Julia blushed, but she could not look away. His magnetic gaze was focused entirely on her.</p><p>\u201cThis evening is only one small example of her philanthropic work. Yesterday, we spent the day at the Franciscan orphanage, spending time with the children. Earlier today, my wife was on a mission of mercy with the poor and homeless, in the city center. My challenge to you this evening is to enjoy the beauty of the illustrations of Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy, and then to find it in your hearts to celebrate beauty, charity, and compassion in the city Dante loved, Firenze. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>The crowd applauded, with one exception. No one seemed to notice the fair-haired man\u2019s cynical reaction to Gabriel\u2019s call to virtuous living, or the contempt he expressed when Dante was mentioned.</p><p>Gabriel returned to Julia and kissed her cheek chastely before facing the applauding crowd. They posed for photographs and cut the ribbon that was strung across the doors that led into the exhibition. The exhibit was declared open, to the sound of much applause.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Vitali gestured to the room, indicating that the Emersons should be the first to view the collection.</p><p>Gabriel and Julianne entered the room and were immediately awestruck. The space had been renovated, its normally pale walls painted a bright blue to better display the pen-and-ink illustrations, only some of which were in color.</p><p>The illustrations were arranged in order, beginning with Botticelli\u2019s famous Chart of Hell. In viewing the collection, one was able to witness the journey of a man\u2019s soul from sin to redemption. And of course, there was the inevitable reunion of Dante with his beloved Beatrice.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Gabriel held Julia\u2019s hand as they stood in front of one of their favorite images, Dante and Beatrice in the sphere of Mercury. Beatrice was wearing flowing robes and pointing upward while Dante followed her gesture with his gaze.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d She linked their pinky fingers together. \u201cDo you remember the first time you showed it to me? When I came to dinner at your apartment?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lifted her hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to her palm. \u201cHow could I forget? You know, I showed them to you on impulse. I hadn\u2019t even told Rachel about them. Somehow, I knew I could trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can trust me.\u201d Her dark eyes grew serious.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He appeared conflicted and for a moment Julia thought he was going to confess his secrets, but they were interrupted.</p><p>The attractive, fair-haired man approached, angling to view the illustration.</p><p>As if in a dream, Julia watched the stranger move. His body almost appeared to float across the floor, his footsteps light and fluid. He appeared tall but was actually an inch or two shorter than Gabriel. Julia perceived that although the man was trim, his elegant black suit hid muscles that rippled beneath the fine material.</p><p>The Emersons politely retreated, but not before Gabriel locked eyes with the other guest. Wordlessly, Gabriel placed his body between the stranger and Julianne, blocking her from his view.</p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d The stranger addressed them with a British accent, bowing formally.</p> <p>To Gabriel\u2019s trained ear, the accent sounded Oxonian.</p><p>\u201cEvening,\u201d Gabriel clipped, his palm sliding down Julia\u2019s wrist in order to grasp her hand.</p><p>The guest\u2019s eyes followed the path of Gabriel\u2019s hand, and he smiled to himself.</p><p>\u201cA remarkable evening,\u201d he commented, gesturing at the room.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d said Gabriel, gripping Julia\u2019s hand a little too tightly.</p><p>She squeezed back, indicating that he should release the pressure a little.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s generous of you to share your illustrations.\u201d The guest\u2019s tone was ironic. \u201cHow fortunate for you that you acquired them in secret and not on the open market.\u201d</p><p>The stranger\u2019s eyes traveled from Gabriel\u2019s to Julia\u2019s, pausing briefly. His nostrils flared and then his eyes appeared to soften before he turned to the drawing nearby.</p><p>\u201cYes, I count myself lucky. Enjoy your evening.\u201d With a stiff nod, Gabriel moved away, still gripping Julia\u2019s hand.</p><p>She was puzzled by Gabriel\u2019s behavior but elected not to ask him about it until they reached the opposite end of the gallery.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, but stay away from him.\u201d Gabriel was visibly agitated, and he passed a hand over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Julia stopped, facing him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s eyes were sincere. \u201cBut there\u2019s something about him. Promise me you\u2019ll stay away.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed, the sound echoing across the gallery. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit odd, but he seemed nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPit bulls are nice until you put your hand in their cage. If he moves in your direction, turn around and walk away. Promise me.\u201d Gabriel dropped his voice to a whisper.</p><p>\u201cOf course. But what\u2019s the matter? Have you met him before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, but I\u2019m not sure. I didn\u2019t like how he was looking at you. His eyes could have burned holes in your dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I have Superman to protect me.\u201d Julia kissed her husband firmly. \u201cI promise to avoid him and all the other handsome men here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s handsome?\u201d Gabriel glared at her.</p><p>\u201cHandsome the way a work of art is handsome, not the way you are. And if you kiss me now, I\u2019ll forget him entirely.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel leaned forward and caressed her cheek with the backs of his fingers before pressing their lips together.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She chewed at the inside of her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you embarrassed me in your introduction. I don\u2019t like the attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the true benefactor. I\u2019m merely your escort.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed again, but this time the sound barely echoed. The room had filled with other guests, who were waiting a respectful distance away.</p><p>\u201cYou make a charming escort, Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He leaned over to whisper in her ear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I embarrassed you with my introduction. I was hoping to motivate some of our guests to consider donating to the orphanage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen embarrass me all you like. If one person decides to support the orphanage, this entire exhibit will have been a success. Even if they hate the illustrations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could anyone hate something so exquisite?\u201d Gabriel gestured at the room.</p><p>Julia couldn\u2019t argue. Several different artists had illustrated Dante\u2019s work over the centuries, but Botticelli had always been her favorite.</p><p>They continued through the room, pausing in front of each picture. Gabriel noted with satisfaction that the stranger seemed to have disappeared.</p><p>When they\u2019d reached the one hundredth and final illustration, Julia turned to her husband.</p><p>\u201cAn incredible exhibit. They did a fantastic job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t finished.\u201d Gabriel tried to smother a smile, his sapphire eyes sparkling.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She looked around, confused.</p><p>He took her hand in his and led her to the second floor and into the Botticelli room.</p><p>She stopped short, as she always did, when she passed through the doors. Seeing The Birth of Venus and Primavera in the same room always left her breathless.</p><p>It was the location of Gabriel\u2019s lecture during their first visit to Florence. He\u2019d spoken of marriage and family then, things that at the time seemed as ethereal as a dream.</p><p>As she stood in front of Primavera, she felt happy. Something about the painting comforted her. And it was never as magnificent to view a copy as it was to see the original.</p><p>If she closed her eyes, she could feel the silence of the museum, hear the echoes from the distant corridor. If she concentrated, she could conjure Gabriel\u2019s voice, lecturing on the four loves of eros, phileo, storge, and agape.</p><p>All of a sudden, she opened her eyes, her gaze drawn to the image of Mercury on the far left. She\u2019d seen the painting a thousand times. But at this moment, his figure disquieted her. There was something about his appearance, something about his face that seemed strangely familiar . . .</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve made an addition to this room since your last visit.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice interrupted her musings.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He grasped her elbow, moving her to the right so she could see a large framed black-and-white photograph that hung on the wall opposite The Birth of Venus.</p><p>She covered her mouth with her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that doing here?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tugged her until she was standing in front of a photograph of herself. She was in profile, her eyes closed and her long hair held up by a pair of man\u2019s hands. She was smiling.</p><p>The picture was one that Gabriel had taken back in Toronto, when she\u2019d first agreed to pose for him. She looked at the tag underneath the photograph and read the following,</p><p>\u00abDeh, bella donna, che a\u2019 raggi d\u2019amore</p><p>ti scaldi, s\u2019i\u2019 vo\u2019 credere a\u2019 sembianti</p><p>che soglion esser testimon del core,</p><p>vegnati in voglia di trarreti avanti\u00bb,</p><p>diss\u2019io a lei, \u00abverso questa rivera,</p><p>tanto ch\u2019io possa intender che tu canti.</p><p>Tu mi fai rimembrar dove e qual era</p><p>Proserpina nel tempo che perdette</p><p>la madre lei, ed ella primavera\u00bb.</p><p>\u2014DANTE, PURGATORIO 28.045-051.</p><p>\u201cAh, beauteous lady, who in rays of love</p><p>Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,</p><p>Which the heart\u2019s witnesses are wont to be,</p><p>May the desire come unto thee to draw</p><p>Near to this river\u2019s bank,\u201d I said to her,</p><p>\u201cSo much that I might hear what thou art singing.</p><p>Thou makest me remember where and what</p><p>Proserpina that moment was when lost</p><p>Her mother her, and she herself the Spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are the words Dante speaks when he sees Beatrice for the first time in Purgatory.\u201d Gabriel touched her face, and his eyes met hers with searing intensity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was the same for me. When I saw you in Cambridge after being separated from you, I remembered those words. Just seeing you, standing in the street, made me remember all I\u2019d lost. I was hoping you\u2019d see me and come to me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pulled her against his chest as Julia\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, my sweet girl. You\u2019re my Beatrice and my sticky little leaf and my beautiful wife. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been such a bastard. I wanted to show you how important you are to me. You are my most precious masterpiece.\u201d</p><p>Julia gazed up at him.</p><p>He swiped his thumbs under her eyes before pressing his lips to her forehead.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re my Persephone; the maiden to my monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more talk of monsters.\u201d She brushed his tuxedo with her hand, worried that she\u2019d transferred tears and makeup to the wool.</p><p>Then he was kissing her until she was breathless, arms wrapped tight around her back. When he released her, she giggled.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re impressed with the exhibition, Mrs. Emerson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her face grew grave. \u201cBut I\u2019d like you to take the photograph down. It\u2019s a magnificent gesture, but I don\u2019t want to be on display.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked from Gabriel to the photograph and back again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging there for all to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVitali wished to give us a gift to thank us, but I refused. When I asked if I could do something\u2014ah\u2014unusual for you, he agreed.\u201d Gabriel gestured to the room. \u201cVitali is an old romantic and it pleased him to be able to do something special for us. He agreed to display the picture and give us an hour on this floor, all to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWe have the Botticelli room all to ourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just that.\u201d His blue eyes danced with amusement as he brought his lips to her ear. \u201cWe also have the corridor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This floor is off limits until\u201d\u2014he glanced at his Rolex\u2014\u201cforty-five minutes from now, when we have to go downstairs for the reception and dinner.\u201d</p><p>With one quick movement, she grasped his lapels with both hands and pulled him to her, pressing a long, hard kiss against his lips.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re pleased?\u201d he said, when she finally released him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She grabbed his hand and began tugging him toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakeup sex, museum sex, corridor sex. I don\u2019t care what you call it, but now is our chance.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel found himself chuckling and trotting after a very determined, very fast-moving Julianne, who was tottering on high heels.</p> <p>\u201cYou surprise me, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d She lifted her voice slightly so it could be heard above the tapping of her stilettos.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be shy. You\u2019re supposed to be the seduced, not the seducer.\u201d</p><p>She turned around, her eyes glittering.</p><p>\u201cI want a heart-stopping, mind-blowing orgasm against a Florentine wall, Professor. You\u2019ve just told me we have what I never thought we\u2019d have\u2014privacy in a public space. Screw shyness.\u201d</p><p>Now Gabriel laughed, tipping his head back.</p><p>He marched her swiftly down the corridor and around the corner to the opposite side, where he positioned her in a dark corner between two high marble statues perched atop plinths.</p><p>\u201cThis time, I won\u2019t stop,\u201d he whispered, his large hand pulling up her dress in order to rest on her thigh.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no air conditioning in here, so things might get a little . . . hot.\u201d He stroked the skin of her thigh with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cI would expect nothing less, Professor.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him close.</p><p>He lifted her and her legs surrounded his waist, pressing their lower bodies together. Her back came into contact with the glass of the museum windows and she shivered a little at the cool sensation.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me who is handsome.\u201d He spoke against her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d Julia captured his mouth just as a groan escaped him.</p><p>She kissed him determinedly, her tongue tracing the seam of his lips. He opened to her, and her tongue eagerly entered his mouth.</p><p>They kissed as if they\u2019d been separated for years, lips eager and wanting.</p><p>He slid his hand up and down her thigh before pulling the skirt of her dress higher. The taffeta sighed its approval.</p><p>As he pressed against her more tightly, his fingers moved to the flare of her hip, where he caressed back and forth and back and forth. When he came to rest on her hip bone, he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your panties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like my body when it is with your body, remember? Panties just get in the way.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel groaned, the sound traveling down the empty corridor. \u201cYou\u2019ve been walking around like this all evening?\u201d</p><p>She winked at him provocatively.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder that man was staring at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking about other men.\u201d She tugged at his bow tie.</p><p>He leaned forward to taste her lips again, stroking her tongue with his own.</p><p>Julia shifted in his arms, the heels of her shoes catching on his tuxedo jacket. She undid his bow tie, tossing it to the floor, and hastily unbuttoned his shirt. She began kissing his neck and chest, her lips whispering across the surface of his skin, before sliding a hand down to his waistband.</p><p>But Gabriel would not be rushed. He moved her hand back to his shoulder, then reached between her legs, touching her gently. He was barely able to contain his joy at her reaction to him.</p><p>Julia moved and writhed, moaning in his ear.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me wait,\u201d she begged, trying in vain to pull him closer.</p><p>Gabriel rummaged in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I brought this.\u201d He held up a square foil packet triumphantly.</p><p>She opened her eyes, fixing on the item. \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be uncomfortable all evening otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cDid you plan this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d His left hand squeezed her backside for effect.</p><p>She moved to take it from him, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAllow me, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d He held the packet in his teeth while he unzipped his trousers. Then he ripped the foil before swiftly rolling it over himself.</p><p>Gabriel teased her, sliding back and forth before easing inside. She exhaled in satisfaction, tightening around him.</p><p>There were no words. Indeed, they were beyond speech. Gabriel knew his wife\u2019s body as she knew his, and the two of them moved and responded to one another with an increasing pace.</p><p>Muffled groans and grunts of satisfaction echoed down the corridor, so much so that a group of statues covered their ears. Julia\u2019s back thumped against the window as they moved in concert.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close,\u201d she managed, the last word cut off as her orgasm overtook her.</p><p>Gabriel quickened his thrusts, filling her deeply until he, too, was overcome.</p><p>Julia clung to him as if she were dying, her arms wrapped around his shoulders, her face buried in his neck.</p><p>They were motionless for some time. Gabriel\u2019s breath left his body in a long, relaxed exhalation.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he asked, kissing her cheek.</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d</p><p>They remained in one another\u2019s arms, holding each other tightly as their hearts and breathing slowed. Gabriel gently placed Julia on her feet, and pulled her dress down to cover her. His hand found her waist and he squeezed.</p><p>\u201cCan you walk?\u201d He eyed her, and her expensive shoes, with concern.</p><p>\u201cI think so. I might be a little wobbly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen allow me.\u201d He lifted her into his arms and carried her to a nearby bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIs it very different when you wear one of those?\u201d Julia nodded at the condom that Gabriel threw into a trash can.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t feel as much, so it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d Gabriel proceeded to wash his hands. \u201cFor most of my life, it was all I knew. But knowing what it\u2019s like to be inside you without it makes a condom a kind of torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He dried his hands and leaned over to press a kiss to the top of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m not so selfish that I want you to be uncomfortable or messy simply so I can have better sex.\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>He brought their foreheads together. \u201cSex with you is always magnificent. But that\u2019s because it\u2019s more than just sex. Now I think you\u2019ll have to fix your hair and your face. Or everyone will know that you\u2019ve just had museum sex.\u201d He looked a good deal more than proud of himself.</p><p>She arched an eyebrow. \u201cAnd you\u2019re all set to return to the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Gabriel buttoned his tuxedo jacket.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to make any\u2014adjustments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He cocked his head to one side. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t mind if people realize I just had museum sex with my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re forgetting something, Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour tie.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel reached up to his neck, a look of surprise flitting across his face. He began buttoning his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the floor where I left it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemptress,\u201d he muttered, shaking his head.</p><p>She leaned over the vanity, attending to her hair and makeup. \u201cSo how good was the sex we just had? On a scale of one to transcendent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarth-shattering and tie forgetting.\u201d</p><p>Smugly, she reapplied her lipstick. \u201cDon\u2019t you forget it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>I love exhibition openings,\u201d Julia murmured, as they rejoined the other guests. \u201cThey\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never cease to amaze me.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s hand hovered at her lower back.</p><p>\u201cI could say the same. I think you can see an outline of my body on the window upstairs.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, his hand sliding down to pat her bottom.</p><p>Someone cleared his throat behind them.</p><p>Julia and Gabriel turned to find Dottore Vitali standing a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for interrupting, but would you be willing to speak to a potential donor?\u201d He eyed the Professor hopefully.</p><p>Gabriel looked at Julia. \u201cVitali asked me earlier if I would try to persuade someone to part with a few paintings. But I can delay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersuade the person to donate. I\u2019m just going to wander around for a while.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel kissed her cheek. Then he and his old friend joined a group of well-dressed men and women who were standing near the entrance to the exhibition.</p><p>Julia retraced her steps through the gallery, leisurely admiring the collection. She was standing in front of one of the more colorful illustrations of Dante and Virgil in Hell when an oily voice addressed her in English.</p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around and found herself face to face with Professor Pacciani. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes darted around the room, relieved to discover that they were not alone. Several couples were nearby, also admiring the art.</p><p>He held up his hands. \u201cI have no wish to disturb your evening. All I require is a moment.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes flickered to his. \u201cIn a moment, my husband will return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a moment, my wife will return. I had better speak quickly.\u201d He grinned, exposing his teeth. \u201cI regret what happened in Oxford. If you will recall, I was not the one behaving badly.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped closer.</p><p>Julia took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI remember. But I must be going.\u201d She tried to walk around him, but he sidestepped her.</p><p>\u201cAnother moment, please. Professor Picton was unhappy with my friend\u2019s behavior. So was I.\u201d</p><p>Julia observed him incredulously.</p> <p>\u201cI told Christa to stay away from you. But as you know, she didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Professor. If you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d</p><p>He stood in front of her again, far too close.</p><p>Julia had no choice but to step back.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could mention this to Professor Picton. I am applying for a job with Columbia University in New York. A former student of Katherine\u2019s is the chair of that department. I wouldn\u2019t want any\u2014bad feelings to interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Katherine would interfere in another department\u2019s search process.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would consider it a favor. I\u2019ve already done you a favor.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes flew to his. \u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prevented my friend from sleeping with your husband.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt the world grind to a halt.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her question was far too loud, and so the other attendees turned to stare in their direction.</p><p>Julia\u2019s cheeks flamed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you wish to express your gratitude.\u201d He leaned closer.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour husband was going to meet Christa at her hotel. I persuaded her to turn her attention elsewhere. Favor done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you,\u201d Julia hissed. She leaned forward at the waist and Pacciani took a surprised step back. \u201cHow dare you come to this place of beauty and say these ugly things to me.\u201d</p><p>Pacciani\u2019s face clouded in confusion, as if he were witnessing the impossible transformation of a kitten into a lion. He lifted his hands in surrender.</p><p>\u201cI mean no harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes you do.\u201d Her voice grew louder. \u201cYou and your friend, or whatever she is to you, mean nothing but harm. I don\u2019t care what she told you or what her plans were. You didn\u2019t prevent my husband from doing anything. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Pacciani scowled, as he became conscious of the fact that all eyes were on them. Julia\u2019s exclamation could be clearly heard by the other guests.</p><p>Then his angry expression morphed into a condescending smile.</p><p>\u201cAll men require a little\u2014how do you say? Recreation. It is too much to expect one woman to be enough.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders as if he were reciting a commonly known fact.</p><p>\u201cWomen are not items on a buffet. And my husband doesn\u2019t share your misogyny.\u201d She lifted her chin defiantly. \u201cI won\u2019t be telling Professor Picton anything, other than that you accosted me with lies. Now go away and leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>When he made no movement to comply with her instructions, she pointed an angry finger toward the door.</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d Her steely voice filled the room.</p><p>(It was, perhaps, not the most polite strategy for removing a guest at a lavish event.)</p><p>Julia ignored the looks of incredulity and censure, glaring determinedly at Pacciani, whose face was a mask of fury.</p><p>He lunged toward Julia but was caught at the last moment by a woman who took hold of his arm with an iron grip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d Mrs. Pacciani scolded her husband, but not before giving Julianne a hostile glance.</p><p>Pacciani cursed in Italian, trying to shake off his wife.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Mrs. Pacciani tugged at her husband\u2019s arm. \u201cThere are important people we need to speak to.\u201d</p><p>With a threatening look, Pacciani turned and accompanied his wife to the hallway.</p><p>Julia watched their retreating backs with no little relief. And more than a little anger.</p><p>(Which effectively ruined her afterglow.)</p><p>\u201cDarling?\u201d Gabriel smiled as he entered the room, striding confidently in his tuxedo. As usual, all eyes were on him and his handsome form as he moved smoothly across the floor.</p><p>A few whispers were exchanged by some of the other couples as they watched Gabriel rejoin his wife.</p><p>His smile disappeared. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Julia pursed her lips, trying to control her anger. \u201cProfessor Pacciani cornered me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard. Are you all right?\u201d Gabriel placed a light hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe offered an apology for Christa\u2019s behavior in Oxford. I lost my temper and made a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Gabriel squeezed her shoulder as he fought back a smirk. \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>Julia began to shake, the aftermath of a rush of adrenaline.</p><p>\u201cI called him a misogynist and told him to go. And I pointed at him.\u201d She lifted her index finger, staring at it in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Gabriel brought her index finger to his lips, where he kissed it.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot excellent. Embarrassing. Everyone heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt very much that anyone would blame you. The female guests probably despise him for his lechery, and the male guests probably despise him because he\u2019s slept with their wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to tell Katherine that he dealt with Christa. He\u2019s after a job at Columbia and Katherine is a friend of the chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never get it,\u201d Gabriel scoffed. \u201cKatherine was Lucia Barini\u2019s supervisor. She\u2019s a friend of mine, as well. She\u2019ll see through him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Pacciani wants the job at Columbia in order to be with Christa.\u201d</p><p>Julia appeared disgusted. \u201cI wonder what his wife thinks about that.</p><p>\u201cHe also told me that he prevented you from having a tryst with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith whom?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s tone was sharp.</p><p>\u201cChrista. He said you were going to meet her at her hotel, but that he distracted her. That\u2019s why I lost my temper. I\u2019m afraid the other guests heard everything.\u201d She glanced around the room uncomfortably.</p><p>Gabriel cursed, shifting his gaze toward the door. Pacciani and his wife were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d Gabriel linked their hands and piloted her to a quiet corner. He looked over her shoulder to be sure that no one was eavesdropping.</p><p>He brought their faces close together, dropping his voice. \u201cChrista propositioned me right before your lecture. I should have said something at the time, but I didn\u2019t want to upset you.\u201d</p><p>Julia gazed at him reproachfully. \u201cAnd afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you didn\u2019t tell me about your secret conversation with Paul.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jumped in Gabriel\u2019s jaw, and he nodded.</p><p>Julia released his hand. \u201cYou should have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fragile. I can handle disturbing news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled her eyes heavenward, taking a moment to examine the gallery\u2019s ceiling. \u201cGabriel, until we enter the next life, things will disturb us. It\u2019s part of the human condition. When you keep things from me, it puts a wedge between us.\u201d She gave him a look, heavy with meaning.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, she gestured to the room. \u201cOthers can exploit that wedge.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his expression tight.</p><p>\u201cI think I deserve to know who is making a play for my husband. And when.\u201d She arched an expectant eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>She watched him for a minute, taking in the expression in his eyes and the tightness around his lips. He looked very unhappy. But he also looked protective, and that was not a posture she wanted to disappear.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to tell me things, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Her voice grew soft.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He was being truthful, but they both knew he was holding on to his secrets. At least for the present.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven. But since my good mood from my first foray into museum sex has been ruined, you\u2019re going to have to fix that.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel bowed, not taking his eyes off hers. \u201cI am yours to command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She leaned forward, grabbing his silk bow tie. \u201cBecause my command is pleasure. And I think I\u2019d like it now.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her hair behind her shoulders and brought his lips to her ear.</p><p>\u201cThen come.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-seven</p><p>August 2011</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</p><p>When Julia and Gabriel returned home the last week in August, they arrived to find a plethora of unopened mail. Gabriel gazed at the envelopes that Rebecca had stacked neatly on his desk and decided he\u2019d forgo opening them in order to unpack instead.</p><p>While he was in the bedroom, Julia remained in the study. She glanced at the open door apprehensively before quietly moving to close it.</p><p>She knew that what she was going to do would be a violation of Gabriel\u2019s trust. But, she reasoned, her actions were justified by his silence and his continued reticence to disclose what was troubling him. She\u2019d hoped he would talk to her while they were in Florence. But he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Simply put, she was afraid and she was having difficulty coping with the fear.</p><p>There was a drawer in his desk that he never opened. She was vaguely aware of it, although she\u2019d never had the nerve to look through its contents.</p><p>Gabriel had caught her opening it one day while she was in search of some printer paper, and he\u2019d closed it under her hand, saying there were memories in that space that he did not wish to relive. Then he\u2019d distracted her by pulling her onto his lap on the red velvet chair and making love to her.</p><p>Julia hadn\u2019t touched the drawer since. But today, frustrated and concerned, she sat behind his desk, examining its contents. If Gabriel would not give her answers, perhaps his collection of memories would.</p><p>The Botticelli illustrations, which he\u2019d kept in a locked wooden box in that same drawer, were no longer there, displayed as they were now in the Uffizi. Julia quickly and quietly retrieved the first item, holding it in her hand.</p><p>It was his grandfather\u2019s pocket watch. He\u2019d worn it on occasion, back in Toronto, but since they\u2019d moved to Cambridge it had remained in the drawer. The watch was made of gold and attached to a long chain that had a fish-shaped fob on it. She opened it carefully and read the inscription:</p><p>To William,</p><p>My beloved husband</p><p>Love, Jean</p><p>She closed the watch, placing it on top of the desk.</p><p>The next item she retrieved was an old cast-iron train engine that had clearly seen better days. She imagined Gabriel as a little boy, clutching his train, perhaps demanding that he take it with him when he and his mother left New York. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her insides twisted.</p><p>She placed the train on the desk and returned her attention to the drawer.</p><p>There was a wooden box, which she opened. In it, she found a string of large South Sea pearls and a ring with diamonds set into the band. Julia picked up the ring to look for an inscription, but there wasn\u2019t one. She saw two silver bracelets and a necklace, all of which were marked from Tiffany.</p><p>The jewelry had to have been his mother\u2019s. But she wondered about its source. Gabriel had told her several times of the poverty they\u2019d lived in. How could someone who was so poor have such expensive jewelry? And why didn\u2019t his mother sell the jewelry when money grew short?</p> <p>Julia shook her head. Gabriel\u2019s childhood was tragic, to be sure, but so was his mother\u2019s life.</p><p>She closed the box and turned her attention to the photographs, which had been sorted into envelopes. She leafed through them quickly, finding pictures of Gabriel and his mother, and a few snapshots of a man and a woman who must have been Gabriel\u2019s parents. Surprisingly, however, there were no photos of Gabriel\u2019s parents together.</p><p>Like Gabriel, his mother had dark hair, but her eyes were dark too, against pale, milky skin. She was fine featured and very beautiful.</p><p>In contrast, Gabriel\u2019s father was gray haired with piercing sapphire eyes. He was attractive for an older man, but there was an overall harshness to his expression that Julia didn\u2019t like. In the pictures, he rarely smiled.</p><p>At the back of the drawer, underneath a worn teddy bear, was a diary. Julia opened it and looked at the flyleaf.</p> <p>This is the Property</p><p>of</p><p>Suzanne Elizabeth Emerson.</p><p>On impulse, she opened it to a random page. Her eyes alighted on the sentence written at the very top:</p><p>I\u2019m pregnant.</p><p>Owen wants me to have an abortion.</p> <p>He gave me money and said that he\u2019d make the appointment.</p><p>He said that if I did this for him, he\u2019d find a way for us to be together.</p><p>But I don\u2019t think I can do it.</p><p>Julia slammed the book shut and hurriedly shoved it to the back of the drawer.</p><p>Gabriel could come looking for her at any moment. He\u2019d be incredibly angry at what she\u2019d done.</p><p>She already regretted it. Suzanne Emerson\u2019s words flashed before her eyes. If Gabriel were to read them, he\u2019d hate his father even more.</p><p>She placed the teddy bear back where she found it, along with the photographs and the jewelry box. She was about to return the train to the drawer when she noticed what was next to it, sitting atop the pile of unopened mail.</p><p>It was a letter.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t recognized the handwriting, but it didn\u2019t matter. Paulina\u2019s name and address were neatly written in the top left corner of the envelope. Somehow, she\u2019d discovered Gabriel\u2019s address and sent the letter to their home.</p><p>Their home. The home Gabriel shared with his wife.</p><p>Julia wanted to fling the letter into the fireplace.</p><p>She was already beginning to keep secrets\u2014reading his mother\u2019s diary when he wasn\u2019t looking. She couldn\u2019t throw Paulina\u2019s letter away, too.</p><p>Holding the envelope away from her body, she walked to the bedroom and handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll go through the mail later.\u201d He moved to toss the envelope on the bed, but she stopped him.</p><p>\u201cLook at the return address.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel glanced at the letter.</p><p>He cursed.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she writing to me? Not even Carson, my lawyer, hears from her now.\u201d</p><p>Julia remained motionless, watching him.</p><p>He ripped open the letter, expecting to find a long, handwritten missive. He was surprised to find a single piece of cardstock.</p><p>He read the printed words quickly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wedding invitation.\u201d He turned the card over, finding Paulina\u2019s flowing script on the back.</p><p>Gabriel,</p><p>I would never be gauche enough to invite you to my wedding.</p><p>I simply wanted you to know that I\u2019m getting married.</p><p>After all these years, I\u2019ll finally be a wife and a mother, to two wonderful girls.</p><p>Now that we\u2019re both happy, things are as they should be.</p><p>XO,</p><p>P.</p><p>He handed the invitation to Julia for her perusal.</p><p>Julia skimmed it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Julia searched his face.</p><p>He placed the invitation back in the envelope. Then he tapped it against the open palm of his left hand.</p><p>\u201cShe expressed it correctly\u2014we\u2019re both happy. She\u2019s found the family she wanted.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes trained on Julia\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShe has you to thank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who persuaded me to let her go. That she\u2019d never find her own happiness while she was dependent on me. You were right.\u201d</p><p>Julia shifted her weight at his praise, all too conscious of the fact that she\u2019d been snooping through his personal effects only minutes earlier.</p><p>\u201cYou were right about Maria, too.\u201d Now his eyes were sad.</p><p>Julia went to him, wrapping her arms about his waist.</p><p>\u201cI wish I weren\u2019t right about Maria. But sometimes loving someone means that you have to let them go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never let you go. I\u2019d challenge anyone to try to take you away from me.\u201d He sounded fierce.</p><p>Julia pressed her fingertips to his lips. \u201cRemember that when you\u2019re working things out in your own mind. No matter what your troubles are, I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him again, then she disappeared into the hall.</p><p>Gabriel looked at the invitation, his mind wandering into the past.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-eight</p><p>January 2010</p><p>Toronto, Ontario</p><p>Paulina Gruscheva entered the lobby of the Manulife Building, her high-heeled boots clicking against the marble floors, her cell phone pressed to her ear. She\u2019d been resident in Toronto for some time, but Gabriel had refused to see her, speak with her, or entertain any communication with her at all.</p><p>She\u2019d grown tired of waiting.</p><p>When she reached Gabriel\u2019s voice mail, she hung up and dialed his landline. She prayed silently that Julianne wouldn\u2019t answer. It was bad enough that he was sleeping with her. She didn\u2019t have to have their affair thrown back in her face.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Undeterred by the fact that he wasn\u2019t answering his phones, she approached Mark, the security guard, demanding that he contact Professor Emerson immediately. When he refused, she fluttered her eyelashes and tried to cajole him. He was immune to her tall, blond, blue-eyed charms.</p><p>She raised her voice, creating a scene.</p><p>Within minutes, Mark contacted the Professor and asked that he please meet his guest in the lobby.</p><p>Paulina smiled triumphantly.</p><p>But her smile disappeared when she saw him, his expression furious, his eyes snapping, as he walked toward her. He grabbed her elbow roughly and half-dragged her through the lobby and out to the semicircular driveway in front of the building.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he spat, releasing her.</p><p>Paulina retreated a step, surprised by his fury.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you. I\u2019ve been here for weeks. You wouldn\u2019t see me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not having this conversation again. I said all I had to say to you back in Selinsgrove. You know where you stand.\u201d</p><p>He turned to go back into the building, but she caught his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d Her voice faltered as she blinked back tears.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression softened. Marginally.</p><p>\u201cPaulina, it\u2019s over. It\u2019s been over for a while. I\u2019m not trying to do anything to you other than persuade you to move on with your life. And to let me move on with mine.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him as the tears began to fall.</p><p>\u201cBut I love you. We have a history!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel closed his eyes for a moment, and a pained look spread across his face.</p><p>He opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with someone else. I\u2019m sleeping, exclusively, with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. And she\u2019s your student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She tossed her hair behind her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable the kind of information you can gather in a city of this size. Antonio from Harbour Sixty was quite forthcoming.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Funny how you took her to the restaurant you always take me to when I\u2019m in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t taken you there in a very long time, Paulina. Even after we stopped\u2014\u201d He paused, struggling.</p><p>\u201cAfter we stopped\u2014fucking, Gabriel? Why can\u2019t you say it? We\u2019ve been fucking for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your dirty little secret. We were friends. We had a relationship. You can\u2019t just ignore me and treat me as if I were trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for how I treated you. But listen to yourself. Don\u2019t you think you deserve to be the center of someone\u2019s universe? Instead of chasing after someone who wants someone else?\u201d</p><p>She tore her eyes from his. \u201cYou always wanted other women. Even when I was pregnant. Why should now be any different?\u201d</p><p>He flinched. \u201cBecause you deserve to be with someone who wants you as much as you want him. It\u2019s time to move on. It\u2019s time to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me happy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re all I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with Julianne and I\u2019m going to marry her.\u201d He sounded determined.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You\u2019ll come back. You always come back.\u201d She wiped a few tears away with the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cNot this time. In the past, I was weak and you held my guilt over me. But no more. We can\u2019t see each other and we can\u2019t speak. I\u2019ve been patient with you and I\u2019ve tried to help, but I\u2019m done. As of today, your trust fund is frozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. If you go back to Boston and begin seeing a therapist, I\u2019ll see that you continue receiving support. But if you contact me again, or if you do anything to hurt Julianne, you\u2019ll be cut off. Permanently.\u201d He leaned forward menacingly. \u201cAnd that includes doing anything to hurt her life as a student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that? You\u2019d just throw me away? I\u2019ve sacrificed my life for you. I lost my academic career!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted you to do that. I did everything I could to help you stay at Harvard. You dropped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of what happened to me. Because of what happened to us!\u201d</p><p>His hands fisted at his sides.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deny that I\u2019ve behaved abominably and you have every reason to be angry. But my admission doesn\u2019t change the fact that this has to end. Today.\u201d</p><p>He leveled his gaze on her and for a moment, he wore a look of compassion.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Paulina. Be well.\u201d</p><p>He moved toward the sliding doors.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You won\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>His face wore a look of steely resolve.</p><p>\u201cI already have.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel walked into the Manulife Building without a backward glance, leaving Paulina outside, crying, and standing in the snow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-nine</p><p>May 2010</p><p>St. James the Apostle Cemetery</p><p>West Roxbury, Massachusetts</p> <p>Gabriel stood in front of the stone angels, their twin forms positioned like sentries on either side of the memorial. The angels were made of marble, their skin white and perfect. They faced him, wings spread wide, with a name etched on the marker that sat between them.</p><p>The monument reminded him of the memorials in Santa Croce, in Florence. The likeness was intentional, since this monument was crafted after his own design.</p><p>As he regarded the angels, he thought back to his time in Italy, of his volunteer work with the Franciscans. Of his experience next to St. Francis\u2019s crypt. Of his separation from Julianne.</p><p>If only he could wait until July first, there would be the possibility of reunion. But Gabriel wasn\u2019t sure that she\u2019d forgive him. He wasn\u2019t sure anyone would forgive him, but he had to try.</p><p>He reached into his pocket and retrieved his cell phone, dialing a number from the contact list.</p> <p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cPaulina. I need to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He turned his back on the monument, somehow unable to speak to her while staring at the name that was carved in stone.</p><p>\u201cI just need to see you for an hour, to talk. Can we meet tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Minnesota. What\u2019s this about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll fly to Minneapolis tonight. Can we meet?\u201d He was insistent, his voice tense and thin.</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s meet at a Caribou Coffee tomorrow morning. I\u2019ll email the address.\u201d</p><p>She paused, and Gabriel could hear her fidgeting in the background.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never flown across country to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his teeth. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur last conversation wasn\u2019t exactly pleasant. You left me outside your building, crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulina.\u201d His tone was slightly pleading.</p><p>\u201cThen you cut off all contact.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel began to pace, the phone pressed tightly to his ear.</p><p>\u201cI did. And then what happened?\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI went home.\u201d</p><p>He stopped pacing.</p><p>\u201cYou should have gone home years ago, and I should have encouraged you to do it.\u201d</p><p>Silence reverberated between them.</p><p>\u201cPaulina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to hurt, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he confessed. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He ended the call and hung his head before returning to the grave of their child.</p><p>Paulina was nervous. She\u2019d been utterly humiliated during her confrontation with Gabriel in the lobby of the Manulife Building. Acutely aware of her dependence on prescription sleep aids and alcohol, along with her dependence on her trust fund, she did what she\u2019d sworn she would never do. She went home.</p><p>She found a job. She moved into a modest but nice apartment. Even more incredibly, she met someone. Someone kind and loving, who wanted her and only her. Someone who would never look at another woman for the length of their relationship, and possibly, beyond.</p><p>Now Gabriel wanted to talk, in person.</p><p>Paulina loved Gabriel. But she also feared him. He\u2019d been elusive and unattainable, even when she was pregnant and they\u2019d lived together. There was always a part of him that he would never let her touch. She knew it. She accepted it. But she never liked it and she always felt his distance hanging over her, like a dark cloud that might pour rain at any moment.</p><p>In the aftermath of their final confrontation, she realized he would never love her. She\u2019d thought that Gabriel was simply incapable of love. But when she heard him speak about Julianne, it became clear that he was capable of loving someone and being faithful. How tragic that the woman he was capable of loving was someone other than her.</p><p>Once she accepted it, a degree of freedom accompanied the inevitable pain and longing. She was no longer a slave trying to win her master\u2019s affection. She was no longer someone with limited aspirations, putting her future on hold in order to keep herself available for him.</p><p>As she entered the Caribou Coffee shop, she felt strong for the first time in years. It would be difficult to see him but she\u2019d made so much progress in other areas of her life, surely she could make progress in her relationship with him.</p><p>She found him sitting at a table for two in the back of the shop, his long fingers wrapped around a coffee mug. He was wearing a jacket and a button-down shirt but no tie. His trousers were clean and pressed and his hair was tidy. He was wearing his glasses, which surprised her, since he only wore them while reading.</p><p>When he saw her, he stood.</p><p>\u201cCan I buy you a coffee?\u201d He offered her a restrained smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d She smiled in return but felt awkward. In the past he\u2019d usually greeted her with a kiss, but now he maintained a polite, proper distance.</p><p>\u201cStill taking your coffee with skim milk and sweetener?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>He moved to the counter as she took the chair opposite his.</p><p>As he waited for Paulina\u2019s order to be filled, Gabriel scratched his chin. She looked different. She still moved like a ballerina, her spine straight and her limbs controlled. But her appearance had changed.</p><p>Her long blond hair was pulled into a low ponytail, her beautiful features free of cosmetics. She looked fresh and young, and much of the hardness that was evident in her expression the last time he\u2019d seen her was gone.</p><p>Her clothes were different, too. She\u2019d always dressed well, with a preference for skirts and high heels fashioned by the latest designer. But today, she was clad in a long-sleeved blue top that was casual and plain, and she wore dark jeans with sandals. It had been years since Gabriel had seen her in casual clothes. He wondered what it meant.</p><p>He placed the drink in front of her and took his seat, his hands moving once again to wrap around his coffee mug. He focused on the black liquid, trying to figure out what to say.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired.\u201d Her blue eyes fixed on him with concern.</p><p>Gabriel avoided her gaze, turning to look out the window. He wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Minneapolis scenery. He simply didn\u2019t know how to begin.</p><p>\u201cWe were friends once.\u201d She sipped her coffee and followed the path of his eyes, watching the cars that drove past. \u201cYou look as if you could use a friend.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head, his eyes starkly blue behind the black frames of his glasses. \u201cI\u2019ve come to ask for your forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she placed her mug down on the table quickly, so as not to spill it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed loudly. \u201cI never treated you the way a friend or a lover should be treated. I was callous and selfish.\u201d He sat back in his chair and looked out the window again. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to forgive me. But I wanted to see you and say that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Paulina tried unsuccessfully to pry her focus from his face and his clenched jaw, but she couldn\u2019t. She was almost shaking, she was so surprised.</p><p>He watched the traffic pass and waited, waiting for her to say something. But she didn\u2019t. At last, he met her gaze.</p><p>Her mouth was open, her eyes wide. Then she closed her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe were involved for years, Gabriel, and you never once said you were sorry. Why now?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, just leveled his eyes, the muscle in his jaw the only movement in his face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of her, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel said nothing. Facing Paulina was difficult enough. He couldn\u2019t speak of what Julianne meant to him\u2014of how much she\u2019d changed him, and of how much he feared the possibility that she wouldn\u2019t forgive him when he returned to her.</p><p>He accepted Paulina\u2019s censure without argument. In his current state, he craved punishment and disapproval, for he was all too conscious of his own sin.</p><p>She watched his reaction, the emotions that moved across his face. He was in evident distress, something she\u2019d not seen for some time.</p><p>\u201cI moved home,\u201d she volunteered, quietly. \u201cI enrolled in a treatment program and I\u2019m going to meetings. I\u2019ve even been seeing a counselor.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him carefully. \u201cBut you knew that, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019ve been sending reports to Carson\u2019s secretary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe changed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s changed you. She\u2019s\u2014tamed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, it is. How long have we known each other? How long were we sleeping together? Never once did you ask me to forgive you for anything. Not even for\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted her quickly. \u201cI should have. I tried to make up for things with money. By taking care of you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel winced, even as he said the words. He was familiar, all too familiar, with the type of man who would act in such a way so as to cover up his sexual indiscretions.</p><p>Paulina picked up her coffee mug once again. \u201cYes, you should have. But I was a fool to settle for what we were. I couldn\u2019t see my way out of it. But now I can. And I swear to God, Gabriel, I\u2019m not going back.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together, as if she were trying not to say any more. Then, unexpectedly, she continued.</p><p>\u201cAll these years, I was worried that my parents would slam the door in my face. I made sure that the taxi waited in the driveway while I rang the doorbell.\u201d She looked down at the table. \u201cI didn\u2019t make it that far. I was trying to navigate through the snow in my high heels when the front door opened and my mother came outside. She was still in her slippers.\u201d Paulina\u2019s voice caught and her eyes welled up with tears. \u201cShe ran to me, Gabriel. She ran to me and wrapped her arms around me. I realized before I even entered the house that I could have come home years ago and she would have greeted me exactly the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prodigal daughter,\u201d Gabriel murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can understand my desire for forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him, his eyes, his expression. There was nothing about him that seemed insincere.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering why you\u2019re asking for this now.\u201d</p><p>He retreated back into his chair, his hands clutching his mug.</p><p>\u201cYou were my friend,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd look at how I treated you.\u201d</p><p>Paulina wiped at her eyes.</p><p>Gabriel leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s Maia.\u201d</p><p>An involuntary cry escaped Paulina\u2019s lips.</p><p>She was like him, in this respect. The mention of their child\u2019s name caused immediate anguish. When the name was used without warning, the pain was especially sharp.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk about her.\u201d Paulina closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s happy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t believe that. When you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re dead. You go to sleep and never wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>At Gabriel\u2019s tone, Paulina\u2019s eyes snapped open. There was something in his eyes. Something he was trying to hide, but that he clung to with more conviction than she\u2019d ever seen him manifest before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know I have no right to ask you. I know that I\u2019m troubling you by being here.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cBut I had to say these things in person. I wronged you. I was monstrous. I\u2019m sorry. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Now she was crying, tears slipping from her eyes and down her perfect face.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulina. We did this one, beautiful thing together. Let\u2019s not mourn her by living empty, wasted lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow dare you! You come to me to ease your conscience and say something like that!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel ground his teeth together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to ease my conscience. I\u2019m here to make amends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy baby is dead and I can\u2019t have another. Make amends for that.\u201d</p><p>He tensed. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never loved me. I wasted my life on a man who merely tolerated me. And only because I was good in bed.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jumped in Gabriel\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cPaulina, you have many admirable qualities, not least of which are your intelligence, your generosity, and your sense of humor. Don\u2019t sell yourself short.\u201d</p><p>She laughed mirthlessly. \u201cIn the end, it didn\u2019t matter. No matter how smart I am, I was dumb enough to try to change you. I failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI moved on with my life and you come here to dredge it all up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did it just the same.\u201d She wiped her eyes with her hands, shifting her body away from him. \u201cYou get to go home to your young, pretty girlfriend knowing that she could give you a child, if that\u2019s what you want. Vasectomies are easily reversed, but what happened to me can never be undone.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel hung his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. For everything.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, he stood to his feet. He moved to walk past her, but she caught his hand.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked down at her, his eyes wary.</p><p>\u201cI met someone. He\u2019s a professor. He helped me get a job teaching English literature while I finish my PhD by extension.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your money. I won\u2019t be withdrawing from the trust fund again.</p><p>\u201cKeith is a widower with two little girls. One is seven and the other is five. Can you imagine? They call me Auntie Paulina. I get to dress them and do their hair and have tea parties with their dolls. I met someone who loves me. And his girls need me. So even though I can\u2019t have a child, I\u2019m still going to be a mother. Or at the very least, an auntie. I forgive you, Gabriel. But I won\u2019t have this conversation again. I made my peace with the past, as much as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a genuine smile, and he brushed his lips against the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Paulina. Be happy.\u201d</p><p>He released her hand and walked away.</p><p>Chapter Forty</p><p>August 2011</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</p><p>Going for a run?\u201d Julia glanced up from the breakfast table to see Gabriel clad in his jogging clothes and shoes. He was wearing a crimson Harvard T-shirt and black shorts that hung loosely from his hips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He crossed the room in order to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014are we going to talk soon?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel turned away and began disentangling the earphones that connected with his iPhone. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now, no.\u201d He removed his sunglasses from their case and quickly cleaned them with the fabric of his shirt.</p><p>Julia bit her tongue, for her patience was almost at an end.</p><p>\u201cHave you made an appointment to see your doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d he muttered, placing his palms flat on the kitchen island and leaning into them, head bent and eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t called the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t need to see him.\u201d</p><p>She uncrossed her arms. \u201cBut what about the vasectomy reversal? You\u2019ll need to speak with him about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d He straightened, nonchalantly picking up his sunglasses and placing them on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having my vasectomy reversed. I\u2019d like us to pursue adoption. I know we can\u2019t adopt Maria, but I\u2019d like us to look into adopting a child when you graduate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve decided,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>A muscle jumped in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m protecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about all our conversations? What about what we talked about in the orchard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were wrong?\u201d She scrambled to her feet. \u201cGabriel, what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we please not do this right now?\u201d He began walking toward the door.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get back,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cGive me thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>She bit back an angry response.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me one thing.\u201d</p><p>He paused, looking at her through his sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still love me?\u201d</p><p>His expression grew pained. \u201cI\u2019ve never loved you more.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he opened the door and fled into the warm morning air.</p><p>\u201cHow was your run?\u201d Julia greeted a hot and sweaty Gabriel as he entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m just going to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare for some company?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a half-smile. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>Julia preceded him up the stairs and they entered the master bedroom together.</p><p>He sat on a chair, pulling off his shoes and socks and peeling away his shirt.</p><p>\u201cDid running clear your head?\u201d She studied him intently. The sheen of perspiration was visible on his tanned skin, his muscles rippling with every movement.</p><p>\u201cSomewhat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s troubling you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed loudly, squeezing his eyes shut. Then he nodded and she sat on the edge of the bed, waiting.</p><p>He placed his forearms on his knees, leaning forward. \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve been self-centered. I don\u2019t know how anyone could stand to be near me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she reproached him. \u201cYou\u2019re eminently lovable. That\u2019s why women fall at your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that. It\u2019s all based on appearances. They wouldn\u2019t care if I was selfish so long as I gave them a good fuck.\u201d</p><p>Julia grimaced.</p><p>\u201cI know you. I know all of you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re selfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pursued you when you were my student. I was terrible to my family and to Paulina,\u201d he countered.</p><p>Julia looked over into darkened, tortured eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s in the past. We don\u2019t need to speak of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we need to speak of it.\u201d He placed his head in his hands, gripping his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I\u2019m still being selfish. I could hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Paulina\u2019s miscarriage was my fault?\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s stomach lurched.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, we talked about this. It wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault I was out on a bender all weekend. If I\u2019d been home to care for her, I could have taken her to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go down that road again. You know where it leads.\u201d</p><p>He kept his eyes on the floor. \u201cIt leads to the conversation we had in the orchard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe orchard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to you about having a baby. But I never stopped to think about it in light of what happened with Paulina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, please. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted her. \u201cWhat if her miscarriage was the result of a genetic abnormality? Something I contributed?\u201d</p><p>Julia was stunned into silence.</p><p>\u201cI told you I wanted a child. But I never stopped to think about the risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiscarriages are common, Gabriel. It\u2019s tragic, but it\u2019s true. Have mercy on yourself. There\u2019s a reason why you had that dream about Maia. Accept the peace she offered you and let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the same thing happens to us?\u201d His voice broke on the last word. \u201cLook at what your father and Diane are going through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be devastating. But this is the world we live in. There\u2019s illness and death. We can\u2019t pretend we\u2019re immune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can avoid unacceptable risks.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes grew sad. \u201cSo now you don\u2019t want a baby with me?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head to see tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAll this talk of Paulina.\u201d Julia swallowed hard. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t be jealous, but I envy her. You shared a life-changing experience with her that we might not be able to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in what you\u2019ve said brings relief.\u201d She searched his eyes. \u201cAnd you certainly don\u2019t look happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I want what I can\u2019t have. I can\u2019t go through what I went through with Paulina again. I can\u2019t and I won\u2019t. I won\u2019t let that happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo children,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll adopt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Julia closed her eyes, letting the implication of his words wash over her. She thought of their future, of the images she\u2019d daydreamed about. She thought about telling Gabriel that she was pregnant, about carrying his child inside her body, about holding his hand while she gave birth to a son . . .</p><p>All the images vanished as if in a puff of smoke. Julia felt the loss immediately. She hadn\u2019t realized how much she wanted to have those experiences and to share them with him. Now that he was telling her she couldn\u2019t, she felt pain.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d His eyebrows lifted.</p><p>\u201cYou want to protect me, and that\u2019s admirable. But let\u2019s be clear, there\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt goes deeper than that, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s wrapped up in what happened between your father and your mother.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood up, dropping his shorts to the floor. He turned away, standing naked before her.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cSweetheart, I know that you have scars. You can\u2019t even look at the things in your desk drawer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about that. This is about choosing the risks I\u2019m willing to take. Your father could lose Diane and the baby. I\u2019m not prepared to take that risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife is risk. I could get cancer. Or get hit by a car. You could wrap me in bubble wrap and keep me indoors and I could still get sick. I know that I could lose you too. And as much as I don\u2019t want to say it, someday you\u2019re going to die.\u201d Her voice broke on the last word. \u201cBut I choose to love you now and I choose to build a life with you knowing I could lose you. I\u2019m asking you to make that same choice. I\u2019m asking you to take the risk, with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She moved to him and took his hand in hers.</p><p>He looked down at their entwined fingers. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the risks might be. I have no idea what\u2019s in my medical history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can be tested.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand before releasing it.</p> <p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of your relatives are still alive. You could try to speak with them, find out about the medical history of your parents and grandparents.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cDo you think I would give them the satisfaction of crawling after them, begging for information? I\u2019d rather burn in Hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to yourself. You\u2019re right back where you started\u2014thinking that you aren\u2019t good enough to reproduce. And refusing to find out if there are any obvious issues in your family tree. What about your dream about Maia? What about Assisi? What about me, Gabriel? We prayed for a child. We\u2019ve been praying that God would give us our own child. Are you taking back that prayer?\u201d</p><p>He clenched his fists at his sides but didn\u2019t respond.</p> <p>\u201cAll because you don\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMy beautiful, broken angel.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><p>Gabriel let out an anguished sound as he returned her embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making you dirty,\u201d he whispered, his sweat-slicked chest pressing against her blouse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been cleaner.\u201d She tenderly kissed his stubbled jaw.</p><p>They held one another before Julia led him to the bathroom. Without words, she turned on the shower and quickly divested herself of her clothing.</p> <p>He followed her inside the shower.</p><p>The water was warm and it fell like rain, bouncing and dancing over their bodies and down to the floor. Julia poured soap into her hands and began to wash Gabriel\u2019s chest, her palms gliding lightly over his pectorals.</p><p>He wrapped a hand around her wrist. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to show you how much I love you.\u201d She pressed her lips to his tattoo and then continued, lathering his abdomen with her hands. \u201cI seem to remember a beautiful man doing this for me once. It was like a baptism.\u201d</p><p>They were silent as she explored the steel and sinew of his arms and legs, the firmness of his backside and the bumps of his spine. She took her time, gently touching him until all the suds had rinsed away.</p><p>His eyes pierced hers. \u201cI\u2019ve hurt you, again and again. Yet you\u2019re so giving. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you. Because I have compassion for you. Because I forgive you.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and shook his head.</p> <p>Julia began washing his hair, coaxing him to lean forward so she could reach every dark strand.</p><p>\u201cGod hasn\u2019t punished me yet,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep waiting for him to take you away.\u201d</p><p>She brushed the shampoo from his eyes so he could open them.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t how God works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived an arrogant, selfish life. Why shouldn\u2019t he punish me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod isn\u2019t hovering above us waiting to punish us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d His eyes were tortured.</p><p>\u201cNo. Did you ever once feel that way when we were in Assisi? When we were sitting near St. Francis\u2019s crypt?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cGod wants to rescue us, not destroy us. You don\u2019t have to be afraid of being happy, thinking that he wants to take that happiness away from you. That\u2019s not who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when you\u2019ve had a taste of goodness, it helps you recognize the difference between good and evil. I believe that people like Grace and St. Francis and a whole host of other kind, loving people show us what God is like. He isn\u2019t waiting to punish you and he doesn\u2019t give you blessings just to strip them away.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hands up his chest until they rested on either side of his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you delay having your vasectomy reversed. Whatever you discover, whatever happened, you\u2019re my husband. I want a family with you and I don\u2019t care what your DNA says.\u201d</p><p>His fingers encircled her forearms.</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t ready to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. But I agree with what you said in the orchard. If we want to have a baby, we need to start discussing it with the doctors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about adoption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do both. But please, Gabriel, you need to have the procedure reversed if only to show that you believe you will be a good father. And that you aren\u2019t a prisoner of your history. I believe in you, sweetheart. How I wish you believed in yourself.\u201d</p><p>He stood under the spray of the shower, closing his eyes and letting the water run over his head. He released her, running his hands through his hair before stepping aside.</p><p>Julia took his hands in hers.</p><p>\u201cThese hands are yours. You can use them for good, or for evil. And no amount of nature, biology, or DNA determines those decisions for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an alcoholic because my mother was. That wasn\u2019t a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou chose to go into recovery. Every day, you choose not to drink or to use drugs. It isn\u2019t your mother or AA that\u2019s making that choice\u2014it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what will I pass on to our children?\u201d His voice sounded desperate. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s in my family tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother was an alcoholic. If you\u2019re going to focus on family history, you should ask what I\u2019m going to pass on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only things you could pass on would be beauty and kindness and love.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sadly. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was going to say to you. I saw how the children at the orphanage reacted to you. I saw you laughing and playing with them. And taking Maria for a pony ride. You will give our children love, protection, and care. You will give them a home and a family. And you won\u2019t cast them out when they make a mistake, or stop loving them when they sin. You will love them so desperately you\u2019d die for them. That\u2019s what a father does. And that\u2019s what you will do.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lasered into hers. \u201cYou\u2019re very fierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m protecting someone I love. Or when I\u2019m fighting to stop an injustice. Your giving in to those old lies would be unjust. You\u2019ve done so much to help me, Gabriel. Now it\u2019s my turn. If you want to forget about your family, I\u2019ll support you. If you want to trace every branch of your family tree, I\u2019ll help. But don\u2019t let guilt and fear rob you of your choices. You made the decision to have the procedure reversed. I think you should stick to it. Even if we decide we want to expand our family through adoption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be easier for me to forget about my family. But I can\u2019t try to have a child with you without knowing more about them\u2014at least to discover any obvious health concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy. But you\u2019ll have someone beside you, supporting you. Right now your past has power over you because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s there. Once you know, you won\u2019t have to worry about it anymore. Take a risk with me, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>He buried his face in her neck.</p><p>Of all the gifts God gave me, he thought, the greatest one is you.</p><p>Chapter Forty-one</p><p>Although Gabriel\u2019s concerns were not entirely assuaged by Julianne\u2019s words, he felt relieved. Her belief in him, her love for him, chipped away at his self-doubt. Truly he was blessed beyond all reason to find such a lover, such a wife. When she\u2019d looked into his eyes and said she wanted him to reverse the procedure whether they planned to have a baby or not . . . Gabriel would remember that moment for the rest of his life.</p><p>A proverb from the Hebrew Bible came to his mind: Whoso findeth a wife findeth a great good.</p><p>It was at night, when he felt tortured by his past and fearful for his future, that his hope was shaken. Rather than leaving her side to haunt the house in search of alcohol, Gabriel resolved to wrap his arms around her and hold on. His brown-eyed angel didn\u2019t eliminate his concerns. But she gave him the strength he needed in order to fight.</p><p>The day after their shower, she\u2019d found him in his study on the second floor, poring over a pile of books, his laptop open on the desk.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She entered the study, carrying a glass of Coke. \u201cI brought you a drink.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her appreciatively. \u201cThank you, darling.\u201d</p><p>He patted his lap and she placed the drink on the desk before joining him.</p><p>\u201cDid you put this here?\u201d He gestured at the toy train engine, which was now sitting atop a stack of files.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She squirmed, wondering how she was going to explain herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten about it. It makes a good paperweight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have asked before I went through your things.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt was time. The train was one of my favorite toys as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like an antique. Where did it come from?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scratched at his chin. \u201cI want to say that it came from my father. I seem to remember him giving it to me. But that can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>Julia offered him a sympathetic look.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy book. I\u2019m writing a section on Hell. I think I\u2019ll include some remarks on the Guido story. I\u2019ll cite your paper as an authority, of course.\u201d He kissed her.</p><p>\u201cThat will be easier to do now that my paper is being published.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI received an email from the conference organizers telling me that a European press has agreed to publish a few of the papers. They want me to submit mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour first publication. Congratulations.\u201d Gabriel hugged her tightly, a feeling of pride washing over him.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a great line item for my CV.\u201d She toyed with his glasses. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to need a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her eyebrows. \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, my love, I would endeavor to pluck the stars from the sky, only to shower them at your feet.\u201d</p><p>Julia pressed her hand over her heart. \u201cHow do you do that?\u2019</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay things like that. That\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He offered her a half-smile. \u201cI\u2019ve spent years studying poetry, Mrs. Emerson. It\u2019s in my DNA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly is.\u201d She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him determinedly.</p><p>Their embrace grew heated. Gabriel was about to sweep his books from his desk and lay Julianne out on top of it when she remembered she was there to ask him a favor.</p><p>\u201cUm, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d His voice was a half groan as his hands roamed up and down her sides.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy paper is going to need some revisions before I send it in. They want the manuscript the first week of December. Will you read it and make some suggestions?\u201d</p><p>Her expression telegraphed her trepidation. They\u2019d had a fight about that paper a few months previous. She didn\u2019t want to fight with him about it again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course. It would be my pleasure. I\u2019ll try not to be a bastard when I give you my comments.\u201d</p><p>She grinned wryly. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, can we have desk sex or do you want to chat all afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesk sex, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel removed his glasses, tossing them aside. He closed his laptop and placed it on a nearby shelf before carefully removing the train engine. Then with one sweep of his arm, he sent all the books and papers to the floor before placing Julia on top of the desk.</p><p>Then they spent the next hour engaged in a new kind of marital bliss\u2014desk sex.</p><p>(Desk sex can be very, very good, but it\u2019s important to remove the staplers first.)</p><p>Later, Julia began packing for their trip to Tom and Diane\u2019s wedding, while Gabriel remained in his office, trying to write. He found it difficult to concentrate on Guido da Montefeltro at the site of his most recent (and very passionate) encounter with Julianne.</p> <p>I might never be able to work at this desk again.</p><p>Frustrated, he closed the document he was working on and pulled up his email. He typed a short note to Carson Brown, his lawyer, asking that he begin making inquiries about his biological parents and their families.</p><p>Then he lifted his cell phone and dialed a number.</p><p>Julia entered the bedroom after spending the evening revising her conference paper. Her eyes hurt. She had decided that Paul was right\u2014she was suffering from some kind of eyestrain and needed to see an optometrist. She resolved to make an appointment when she and Gabriel returned from Selinsgrove.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice reached her from the bed.</p><p>She pulled her hands away from her face. He was sitting up, wearing his glasses, and reading.</p> <p>She gave him a sheepish look.</p><p>\u201cI was on the computer too long and now my eyes hurt. I\u2019m going to have them checked when we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Your eyes are so beautiful, it would be shame for them to be injured.\u201d He put a finger in the book that he was reading and extended his other hand to pat the area beside him. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Julia joined him on the bed, noticing that he\u2019d been reading his mother\u2019s diary.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you decide to read that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m beginning my investigation of my family, I thought I shouldn\u2019t put it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it making you sad?\u201d</p><p>He put the diary aside and rubbed his eyes behind his glasses.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tragic more than anything else. She graduated from high school and moved into the city to share an apartment with a girlfriend. Her first job was working for my father\u2019s company. One of his secretaries went on maternity leave and she filled in temporarily. That\u2019s how they met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was young.\u201d Julia clasped her hand in his.</p><p>He glanced down at their connection. \u201cAlmost as young as you when I met you. Funny how history repeats itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Julia said, in a low voice. \u201cYou could have gone down that road. But you didn\u2019t. We\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went down that road with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt her anger flame. \u201cYou didn\u2019t abandon Paulina. You cared for her for years. You are not the kind of man who would abandon your child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay that again.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice was a cross between a growl and a plea.</p><p>Julia reached up to remove his glasses, lying across his body to place them on the nightstand. Then she lifted her face, still reclining over him.</p><p>\u201cGabriel Emerson, you are not the kind of man who would abandon your child. And as much as you might think of yourself as the seducer, we both know our seduction was mutual.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair lightly before lifting her chin and bringing their lips together.</p><p>\u201cOur seduction was most definitely mutual. You\u2019re the only woman who ever persuaded me to give my heart. And you still seduce me, Mrs. Emerson. Every day.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stroked her hair again.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds as if my parents\u2019 affair started while they were working long hours together. One night, he kissed her. Things progressed . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he did. He bought her extravagant gifts. He wouldn\u2019t be seen in public with her, but they\u2019d meet at hotels.\u201d</p><p>Julia fingered her necklace unconsciously.</p><p>\u201cI saw some of the jewelry in your desk. There are things from Tiffany and what looks like a wedding band.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scowled. \u201cHe gave her that ring when I was born. She used to wear it and pretend she was married. What a farce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible he did it to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulianne, nothing my father did protected her.\u201d His voice was cold. \u201cShe was young and had lived a sheltered life with her family. She expected he\u2019d leave his wife and family for her. Obviously that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>Julia tightened her arms around him. \u201cWhat have you done to find out more about your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent an email to Carson, asking him to make inquiries about the Emersons and about my father.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI made a few phone calls today and was able to schedule an appointment with Dr. Townsend. And a urologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you. I know you\u2019re anxious. But no matter what you discover, we\u2019ll face it together.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and brought his hand up to cup the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re serious about learning more about your mother, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>She turned to lie on her back, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cMy father has her stuff. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to ask about it. He\u2019s got a lot on his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Have you heard from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiane sent me an email about my bridesmaid dress. I\u2019m supposed to pick it up when we arrive.\u201d</p><p>Julia was quiet for a moment, thinking. Then she spoke.</p><p>\u201cDo you think God has forgiven you?\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cWhy would you ask me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of our conversation in the shower. You seem to think your past hasn\u2019t really been forgiven.\u201d</p><p>He shifted next to her.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in Assisi, after we\u2019d been separated, it felt as if God forgave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still look at yourself and don\u2019t like what you see?\u201d Her tone was gentle.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I? I have so many faults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do all human beings, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m more conscious of my own sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you haven\u2019t accepted the grace and forgiveness you\u2019ve been offered.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her sharply.</p><p>She moved closer to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying this to grieve you. I see how far you\u2019ve come, and it\u2019s nothing short of a miracle. But part of that miracle is recognizing the magnitude of the grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did so many terrible things,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd God\u2019s forgiveness is so small.\u201d Julia glanced at him out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you act like that sometimes\u2014as if you\u2019re still in Hell. As if God couldn\u2019t forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen be better. Accept the fact that God didn\u2019t bring you this far only to abandon you. He isn\u2019t that kind of father. And you won\u2019t be, either.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pondered her words for a moment.</p><p>\u201cIf what you say is correct, then you have no reason to fear being a mother. No matter what happened with Sharon or what\u2019s in your past, grace is available to you too. I guess we both need to overcome our fears.\u201d</p><p>He caressed her cheek before rolling her beneath him.</p><p>\u201cYou will be a wonderful mother,\u201d he whispered before bringing their lips together.</p><p>Chapter Forty-two</p><p>Labor Day Weekend, 2011</p><p>The Hamptons, New York</p><p>Holy fuck!\u201d Simon exclaimed, collapsing on top of her.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck is right.\u201d She giggled, wrapping her arms around him. \u201cThat was amazing.\u201d</p><p>Simon couldn\u2019t disagree. He could barely feel his body, his orgasm had been so strong.</p><p>Of course, the fact that he and April Hudson were several mojitos past being drunk might have had something to do with it.</p><p>In the back of his mind, there was something he was supposed to remember. Something important. Something regarding April.</p><p>She climbed on top of him. \u201cLet\u2019s do it again,\u201d she slurred, leaning over him. \u201cIt barely hurt. I don\u2019t know why I was waiting . . .\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty-three</p><p>Labor Day Weekend, 2011</p><p>Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania</p><p>Your dad has been using this room as the guest room, but we were thinking of making it the nursery.\u201d Diane opened the door to the small room that was next to the master bedroom.</p><p>Julia entered the room behind her, carrying a blue-and-white gift bag.</p><p>It was a few days before the wedding and she was helping Diane with things around the house.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to paint the walls and have the room ready before the baby came. Now . . .\u201d Diane moved her hand over her abdomen, back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t get the nursery ready.\u201d Julia looked around the room, eyeing three familiar-looking boxes on the floor of the closet.</p><p>\u201cHe might not come home,\u201d Diane whispered, close to tears.</p><p>Julia put an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThe hospital and the doctors are familiar with cases like this. And there are a number of children who\u2019ve gone through the surgeries that little Peanut will have to go through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeanut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we don\u2019t have a name for him, I\u2019ve been calling him Peanut.\u201d</p><p>Diane pressed her hand over her stomach. \u201cI like that. Peanut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all hoping and praying that Peanut will be okay. Decorating the nursery could be an expression of that hope\u2014that you believe he\u2019s coming home.\u201d Julia fidgeted with the bag she\u2019d been carrying. \u201cI bought you and the baby a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. That\u2019s the first gift we\u2019ve received.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince he\u2019s my little brother, I wanted to be the first. Open it.\u201d</p><p>Diane carefully pulled back the tissue paper, revealing a rectangular wrapped object. She placed the bag on the floor and unwrapped the gift. Inside, she found a print of a cherub playing a guitar, housed in an ornate gold frame.</p><p>She held it up in order to admire it.</p><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019ve been hesitant about preparing for the baby.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice was soft. \u201cBut I thought that the angel would be an expression of hope. The painting is called Angelo Musicante and it\u2019s housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, honey.\u201d Diane hugged her. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet.\u201d</p><p>She walked over to the window and placed the frame on the wide windowsill, leaning against the glass. It looked as if it belonged there.</p><p>\u201cYour dad was talking about using your room as the guest room, once the baby comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t really my room. I grew up in Dad\u2019s old house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re my daughter.

I was thinking about having a sailboat theme. Maybe painting a mural of a boat on the wall. I thought it would be soothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds beautiful. I\u2019ll look for some bedding and things with sailboats on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure my little brother has everything he needs. I\u2019m looking forward to spoiling him.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes watered. But he would never admit it.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to decorate?\u201d he asked his fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>\u201cI think we should do a few things. Maybe not everything. After the honeymoon we could paint the walls.\u201d Diane looked up into his face, her eyes cautiously hopeful.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d Tom leaned over to kiss her, pressing his palm lightly over where their child was growing.</p><p>Julia moved to the door, wanting to give them some privacy. \u201cI\u2019ll just go downstairs and see what Gabriel and Uncle Jack are doing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, sweetie.\u201d Diane pulled away from her fianc\u00e9, but not before moving her hand gently over where his hand had rested.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to take those with you? I think they belonged to your mother.\u201d Diane pointed at the boxes that were sitting in the closet.</p><p>The air in the room swiftly changed as Tom and Julia followed the path of her finger.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tom\u2019s tone was sharp.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just sitting there. Maybe there\u2019s something she\u2019d like to take home with her to Massachusetts. But if you don\u2019t want them or you don\u2019t want them now, that\u2019s fine. I opened them just to see what they were, but I closed them back up again. I came across them when I was emptying this room out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to look at Mom\u2019s stuff.\u201d Julia was conscious of her father\u2019s fists opening and closing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not all fired up about having this conversation three days before my wedding,\u201d Tom growled.</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d Diane reproached him.</p> <p>\u201cAll right. Why don\u2019t you ask Gabriel to come up and help me carry them down to your car?\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded and exited the room, but not before seeing her father pull Diane into his arms.</p><p>As she descended the staircase to the front hall, she heard voices coming out of the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou tell her yet?\u201d Julia\u2019s Uncle Jack, Tom\u2019s brother, was speaking.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s tone was clipped.</p><p>\u201cYou going to?\u201d Jack\u2019s gruff voice grew louder.</p><p>\u201cSince everything has been quiet, I haven\u2019t seen the need. She\u2019s been upset enough recently. I\u2019m not about to add to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe better not be living in fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t.\u201d Gabriel sounded impatient.</p><p>\u201cI find she is, you and me got a problem.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s footsteps echoed across the hardwood floor and the voices stopped.</p><p>She entered the living room and saw Jack standing by the far wall, his form menacing.</p><p>Gabriel was standing a few feet away, having adopted a similar posture.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Gabriel lifted his arm and she went to him, curling into his side. \u201cNothing. Did you help Diane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. But I need your help now. I have a few boxes I need to carry out to the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Gabriel gave Jack a significant look as he followed Julia into the hall.</p><p>The day before the wedding, Julia agreed to help Diane\u2019s sister, the maid of honor, by running errands. She visited the florist to double-check the order, she visited the church hall to inspect the decorations, and she stopped in at Kinfolks restaurant.</p><p>Kinfolks would not have been her choice as the location of the rehearsal dinner, but since it was a place that held sentimental value for both the bride and groom, she kept her opinion to herself.</p><p>She\u2019d just finished her meeting with the owner and the manager, ascertaining that everything would be ready for that evening, when she ran into Deb Lundy, her father\u2019s ex-girlfriend, and Natalie, her daughter.</p><p>Julia tried to plaster an artificial smile on her face as Deb approached her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jules. I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Deb. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine. Natalie is home for the weekend and we\u2019ve been doing some shopping.\u201d Deb lifted the numerous bags that she was carrying.</p><p>Julia\u2019s gaze moved nervously from the tall blond woman to her daughter, who was standing some feet away with a sour expression on her face. Both women were dressed in expensive clothing and obviously designer sandals. Both women clutched large Louis Vuitton handbags.</p><p>Natalie was an attractive young woman, with red hair and green eyes. She and Julia had been roommates at Saint Joseph\u2019s University. They\u2019d even been friends. But that was before Natalie decided to sleep with Julia\u2019s then-boyfriend, Simon, and invite her to join them in a threesome.</p><p>\u201cNatalie was supposed to be in the Hamptons this weekend with her boyfriend. You remember him, don\u2019t you? Simon Talbot, the senator\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who he is.\u201d Julia resisted the urge to comment further. Deb knew exactly who Simon was to Julia and that he\u2019d been arrested for assaulting her two years previous. Sadly, the arrest had yielded only a plea agreement and community service.</p><p>Ignoring Julia\u2019s obvious discomfort, Deb prattled on.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Talbot became ill and so their trip to the Hamptons was canceled. But I\u2019m glad Natalie was able to come home. We see so little of her now that she\u2019s working for the senator\u2019s presidential campaign. She has a very important job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d said Julia, trying to keep the contempt out of her voice.</p><p>Natalie ignored Julia and turned to her mother. \u201cWe need to go.\u201d</p><p>Julia watched her former roommate curiously. The last time they\u2019d seen one another was in this very restaurant. Natalie had cornered her and shown her a clip from a video that Simon had made. A video that showed Julia in a compromising position. Natalie had threatened to post the video on the Internet if Julia didn\u2019t withdraw the assault charges against Simon.</p><p>In a surprising turn of events, Julia had stood her ground. She even threatened to go to The Washington Post and tell them that Simon had sent his new girlfriend to blackmail her. The senator would not have been pleased.</p><p>At the time, Natalie seemed skeptical that Julia would carry through on her threat. But she must have changed her mind. There was no evidence that the video had been shared or posted anywhere. It was as if they\u2019d given up.</p><p>Julia wondered occasionally why she hadn\u2019t heard from them. But she decided to count herself lucky and simply accept her good fortune.</p><p>Seeing Natalie now, Julia expected her to be rude or aggressive. She expected Natalie to offer veiled threats or innuendo. Instead, she appeared agitated, shifting her weight back and forth and glancing at the door. It was as if she were afraid of something.</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t see any intimidating people in the restaurant or outside on the sidewalk. She wondered what was bothering Natalie. And why her smugness and superiority had been magically eliminated.</p><p>Deb gestured to her daughter to wait.</p><p>\u201cIt was good seeing you, Jules. I hear your dad is getting married again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever thought he was the marrying kind. I guess old age will do that to you.\u201d</p><p>Julia lifted an eyebrow. Deb was at least as old as her father, if not a year or two older. But she had no wish to be drawn into a confrontation.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Natalie tugged on her mother\u2019s arm, and the two women walked toward the door.</p><p>Julia watched their departing backs with the distinct sense that she was missing something. Something important.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you exhausted?\u201d Rachel leaned over the kitchen island two days later and rested her head on her outstretched arm. \u201cWe were out late the night of the rehearsal dinner, and out late last night at the wedding. I need more sleep.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed as she shucked corn for dinner. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing I had a nap this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Rachel rolled her eyes. \u201cSure you did. Gabriel said he napped this afternoon, too, but he\u2019s never napped a day in his life. I doubt he naps when you\u2019re in bed with him.\u201d</p><p>The color rose in Julia\u2019s cheeks, and she focused intently on the corn as she changed the subject. \u201cThe wedding was beautiful. I can\u2019t believe I got to dance with my dad at his wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have the energy to celebrate your birthday tonight, Jules. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m a bad friend.\u201d Rachel\u2019s voice was muffled by a yawn.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and take a nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. Like you, my husband followed me. Ergo, no nap but lots of babymaking.\u201d</p><p>Julia snickered. \u201cHow is that coming along?\u201d</p><p>Rachel slumped forward dramatically. \u201cI need a vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom babymaking?\u201d</p><p>She groaned, eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cYes, damn it. We\u2019re having sex all the time but I\u2019m not getting pregnant. It\u2019s depressing.\u201d She opened her eyes and rested her head on an upturned hand. \u201cI need a break. Let me come and visit for a few days. I won\u2019t be a bother, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but at what cost? I never thought I\u2019d say this, but we\u2019re having too much sex. I\u2019m beginning to feel like a machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, what have I wandered into?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows knitted together as he entered the kitchen from the back porch.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Your sister is just worn out. Rachel, skip dinner and go lie down in our room. You can join us for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Julia waved a cob of corn in the direction of the stairs. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Like a shot, Rachel was off her stool and flying through the door.</p><p>Gabriel watched her departing form and shook his head. \u201cTell me we aren\u2019t going to be like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to be like that.\u201d Julia pressed a kiss to his temple.</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou convinced me to pursue a reversal, no matter what. And you\u2019ve almost convinced me that my family history doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, sweetheart. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>He took the corn out of her hand and set it aside before clasping her hands in his.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t get our hopes up. It\u2019s been almost ten years since my vasectomy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy adopting. But for your own sake, I want us to try. Eventually. And with less drama than what we\u2019re seeing with Rachel and Aaron.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel laughed and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>Julia snuggled against him, her mouth opening wide into a sustained yawn.</p><p>Gabriel eyed her with concern. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and take a nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s too much to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense. Richard is reading a book on the back porch and Aaron is snoring in front of the television. I think we\u2019ll be having a late dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave our room to Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen use the couch in the study.\u201d He pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cThey worked you pretty hard at the rehearsal and the wedding. You could use a nap.\u201d He winked. \u201cSince you didn\u2019t have one this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Julia kissed him and exited the kitchen.</p><p>Left to his own devices, Gabriel retrieved a small leather book from his briefcase and went outside to join Richard on the porch.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day,\u201d Richard remarked, closing his crime novel.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Gabriel sat down in the Adirondack chair next to his adoptive father\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel showed him the book, on which the word Journal was embossed on the front in gold lettering. \u201cIt\u2019s my mother\u2019s diary.\u201d</p><p>The two men exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cI found something in it from Grace.\u201d Gabriel unfolded two pages that had been tucked inside the journal.</p> <p>Richard gazed on the papers with interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNames, addresses, and telephone numbers. One is for my father. The other is for Jean Emerson of Staten Island. She\u2019s my grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the first time you\u2019ve seen those pages?\u201d Richard made eye contact with his son.</p><p>\u201cYes. Grace gave me my mother\u2019s things when I was a teenager. But I never looked at them.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded, a look of recollection on his face.</p><p>Gabriel peered at Grace\u2019s handwriting. \u201cI\u2019m wondering why she did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive we spoke to you about this when you were a teenager. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s attention momentarily fixated on the woods behind the house.</p><p>\u201cOnly bits and pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen your mother died, social services located your grandmother and asked her to take you. She refused. Grace telephoned her, trying to figure out what the problem was. After she spoke to your grandmother, she placed her name and address with your mother\u2019s things, thinking that you might want to contact her one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember Grace telling me that she spoke with my grandmother, just that social services located my relatives and they didn\u2019t want anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>Richard frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou were only a boy. There was no point in burdening you with everything that happened. I thought that we disclosed the details when you were older.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head.</p><p>Richard\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cI apologize. We should have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to apologize for. You and Grace took me in when my own flesh and blood disowned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are our son.\u201d Richard\u2019s voice grew husky. \u201cYou have always been our son.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s hands gripped the journal more tightly.</p><p>\u201cWill it\u2014offend you if I try to find out more about my biological parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. It\u2019s your heritage and you have a right to know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my dad,\u201d Gabriel observed quietly.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d said Richard. \u201cAnd no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put you and Grace at risk. You mortgaged your home to rescue me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA parent\u2019s love isn\u2019t conditional. No matter what you did, you were always our son. I simply prayed that one day you\u2019d come back to us. And you did.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s knee began to bounce in agitation.</p><p>Richard\u2019s gray eyes grew very intense as he watched him.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t give birth to you, but you are our son. You belonged with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Grace say to my grandmother?\u201d</p><p>Richard sat back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cI think she explained who she was and what happened to your mother. I know she talked about you. She hoped she could reason with your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd could she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Richard appeared grim. \u201cYour grandmother was too blinded by her own morality and her anger with her daughter. She disowned your mother when she became pregnant, and I doubt they saw one another after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my father? Did Grace call him too?\u201d</p><p>Richard shifted his weight. \u201cI know we spoke to you about this because it came up in connection with your birth certificate. Your father persuaded your mother not to list him, which is why it only names your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did Grace find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough your grandmother. She wasn\u2019t in a hurry to help her grandson, but she was eager enough to name your father. She had his address and telephone number, which is probably what you have there.\u201d Richard gestured toward the diary. \u201cGrace knew better than to call him at home. She called him at the office. He refused to speak with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can recall Grace saying that my father knew where I was but that he wasn\u2019t coming to get me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hoped your relatives would welcome you, which is why she called them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace thought the best of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did. But she was no fool. After speaking with your grandmother and trying in vain to talk to your father, she let it go. You\u2019ve been with us ever since.\u201d He looked at Gabriel sadly. \u201cGrace expected that she would be here when you found those pages. I know she would have wanted to talk to you about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have looked at them earlier.\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment about the vision he had of Grace and how she\u2019d forgiven him. He still mourned her.</p><p>\u201cJulianne is very fond of you.\u201d Gabriel changed the subject, if only to free himself of his painful musings.</p><p>\u201cAs I am of her. I have her and you to thank for allowing me to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will always be your home.\u201d Gabriel shifted in his chair. \u201cShe thinks that if God is like a father, he must be like you.\u201d</p><p>Richard chuckled. \u201cA high compliment, but an unwarranted one. I\u2019m imperfect like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that I could have one quarter of your imperfection,\u201d Gabriel muttered, lowering his head.</p><p>\u201cGrace and I always thought of you as a gift. But since she died, I\u2019ve realized something even more profound.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lifted his head, turning to look at his father.</p><p>\u201cI know that you feel some sort of gratitude to us for adopting you\u2014as if we did you a favor. But you\u2019re looking at things the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s eyes met Gabriel\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cGod gave you to us because he knew we needed you.\u201d</p><p>The two men exchanged a long look before gazing out at the orchard and losing themselves in silence. And if anyone had commented on the fact that Gabriel\u2019s eyes were wet, he would have said it was because of his allergies.</p><p>Chapter Forty-four</p><p>September 9, 2011</p><p>Durham, North Carolina</p><p>April Hudson exited her apartment building with the intention of driving to campus, but she was stopped abruptly by a man carrying roses.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cSimon!\u201d She ran to him, wrapping her arms around his neck and squealing. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see you. And to give you these.\u201d He lifted the dozen long-stemmed red roses he held in his left hand.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. Thank you.\u201d She jumped up and down and hugged him.</p><p>He laughed at her exuberance and returned her embrace, burying his nose in her long, blond hair.</p><p>\u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t see you again. Do you want to come in?\u201d she murmured against his neck.</p><p>He nodded, and she led him to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cThese are really beautiful.\u201d She held the bouquet close to her face, inhaling the scent. \u201cAnd you chose red this time. The first time we went out, you bought white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite symbolizes virginity.\u201d He reached out to touch her long, straight hair. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t apply anymore.\u201d</p><p>She cringed as if he\u2019d struck her and quickly handed him back the flowers.</p><p>He was going to ask what the problem was when the elevator door opened. She stepped around him and walked quickly to her apartment, her flip-flops snapping down the hall.</p><p>\u201cApril? Wait up.\u201d He jogged after her, still clutching the bouquet.</p><p>She pulled her keys out of her backpack and opened the door to her apartment. She moved behind the door as if she were going to close it in his face.</p><p>\u201cWait a second.\u201d He placed his palm against the door, holding it open.</p><p>\u201cLook, you didn\u2019t have to fly all the way down here and give me flowers just to gloat. I know I\u2019m not a virgin anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m not here to gloat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell all your friends? I\u2019m sure they had a big laugh over it. Take the nice Christian girl out a couple of times and she gives it up like it\u2019s prom night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what happened.\u201d Simon glared.</p><p>\u201cAfter we spent the weekend together, you didn\u2019t contact me. No phone calls, no texts. Now it\u2019s the weekend and you show up on my doorstep. Did you fly all the way down here for a booty call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. If you\u2019d let me explain, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a booty call, Simon. Take your red roses and go back to Washington. I can\u2019t keep you from bragging about what happened, but it would be nice if you let me tell my parents first. I don\u2019t want my father reading in the newspaper about how I got drunk and slept with you on our second date.\u201d</p><p>She started to close the door, but he flexed his arm, stopping her.</p><p>\u201cJust hold on. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer, dropping his voice.</p><p>\u201cI came here because I wanted to see you. And I chose red roses because I thought you\u2019d like them.\u201d</p><p>April clutched the edge of the door tightly but didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you to dinner and we\u2019ll talk. If you don\u2019t like what I have to say, I\u2019ll get back on a plane and you\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s your angle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Isn\u2019t that reason enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father and the presidential campaign?\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s eyes widened. It took a moment for him to recover himself.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to take you out. I did. That\u2019s where the politics ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Her voice was soft and she looked like she was about to cry.</p><p>\u201cHave a little more confidence in yourself, April. You\u2019re pretty, you\u2019re sweet. I wouldn\u2019t have invited you to the Hamptons and taken you out for mojitos simply for politics.\u201d</p><p>Her expression telegraphed her disbelief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI mean it.

Gabriel was teaching a graduate seminar and an undergraduate class at Boston University, while Julia attended Harvard.</p><p>In the second week of September, Gabriel visited a well-respected urologist. He didn\u2019t want Julia to accompany him, since the appointment conflicted with one of her classes. So he went alone.</p><p>When he arrived home for dinner, she pounced.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood evening to you, too.\u201d He brushed his lips against hers and pulled back, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still getting used to these.\u201d He touched the frames of her tortoiseshell glasses.</p><p>She adjusted them self-consciously before taking them off. \u201cI only need them for reading. At least, that\u2019s what the optometrist said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a sexy librarian. In fact, I think we should take them into the study and introduce them to the wonders of desk sex.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to distract me with desk sex, Professor Emerson. I want to hear about your appointment.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s smile faded.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I promise you consecutive orgasms?\u201d he whispered, grasping her wrist and bringing it to his mouth. He kissed her, nipping at the skin.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cThat sounds\u2014great. But I still want to hear about the doctor.\u201d</p><p>He took a step closer, walking her toward the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I promise you kitchen table sex, the likes of which you\u2019ve never experienced before?\u201d</p><p>He placed her on the edge of the table, spreading her legs so that he could stand in between them.</p><p>She raised her hand to his face. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re worrying me because you\u2019re trying to distract me with sex. Please tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pulled away and sat down heavily on a nearby chair.</p><p>\u201cDid you cook or did Rebecca leave something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRebecca made lasagne.\u201d Julia hopped off the table to retrieve a can of Coke from the fridge. She poured it over ice in a glass and handed it to him. \u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor isn\u2019t sure it will work.\u201d Abruptly, Gabriel placed the glass on the table.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart.\u201d She sat in the chair next to him and placed a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty confident we could do artificial insemination if the reversal is unsuccessful, but I have to be tested to see if I\u2019m producing viable sperm. When he has the results, he\u2019ll determine if we should schedule a reversal or not. My test is scheduled for next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he performs the reversal, the probability of success is low.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cSince the procedure was done almost ten years ago, the chance of pregnancy is thirty percent. There\u2019s a possibility of antibodies, scar tissue, and a secondary blockage point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was so complicated.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s far more complicated than I expected. But it\u2019s a credit to the doctor that he was thorough in his explanation. He also forbade me to smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good thing. When will we know if the procedure is successful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says I could be fertile within a few months or it could take a year.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cOr never.\u201d</p><p>Julia sat in his lap, wrapping her arms around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gabriel. I wish I\u2019d gone with you. I could have supported you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there in spirit.\u201d He gave her a half-smile.</p><p>\u201cIf the sperm production is fine, then we could pursue artificial insemination. If we want, he\u2019ll gather sperm at the time of the reversal and freeze them for us.\u201d He toyed with her hair. \u201cThe doctor suggested you visit a gynecologist, in case there are fertility issues on your side.\u201d</p><p>Julia grimaced.</p><p>Gabriel watched her expression carefully. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t like those kinds of checkups, but I can see why it would be necessary. I\u2019m due for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, the doctor also said that we\u2019ll have to abstain from sex for three weeks after my procedure. He told me that there cannot be any ejaculation.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThree weeks? Scheisse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Are you still sure we should do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy about having to be celibate for three weeks.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cBut I was celibate a lot longer than that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d A smile played at the corners of Gabriel\u2019s lips. \u201cThis will be new for both of us\u2014marital celibacy. Who knew there was such a terrible thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t. Except for, you know, one week a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me. We\u2019ll have to ensure that one of the three weeks coincides with your cycle. Otherwise we might have to be celibate for four weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think of everything, Professor.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes appeared to darken. \u201cI have needs.\u201d</p><p>She pressed their chests together, bringing her mouth inches from his.</p><p>\u201cAs do I, Professor. I\u2019m sure we can attend to some of those needs without involving your injured parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInjured parts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take very good care of you and all your parts. You\u2019ll need me to be your nurse.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel slid his hands down to cup her backside.</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that. A nurse, a librarian, a student, a professor\u2014is there no end to your talents, Mrs. Emerson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. In fact, I have another secret identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>She brought her lips to the curve of his ear, \u201cI\u2019m also Lois Lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll need to pick up my Superman suit from the dry cleaners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be.\u201d He gave her a heated look, heavy with promise. \u201cSo we\u2019ll schedule a few more appointments, but we\u2019ve agreed to pursue this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve also agreed that we aren\u2019t going to start a family until you graduate. This is all\u2014preliminary.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and kissed him, and then they decided to delay dinner in favor of celebratory kitchen table sex during which Gabriel pretended to be Superman, coming home after a long day of fighting crime.</p><p>(It must be said that superhero kitchen table sex was an even better domestic coupling than regular kitchen table sex.)</p><p>A few hours later, Julia and Gabriel sat on the floor in their bedroom, going through Sharon\u2019s boxes. They found photo albums filled with baby and toddler pictures. They found toys and the bracelet Julia had worn in the hospital when she was born.</p><p>She was surprised that her mother kept the baby memorabilia. She was even more surprised to find a copy of her parents\u2019 wedding picture, along with a series of photos from their courtship. There were even a few family pictures that predated the divorce.</p><p>One box held costume jewelry and scarves and photos of Sharon with different men. Gabriel watched as Julia disposed of those pictures with barely a glance. Given what he knew about Sharon\u2019s behavior with her boyfriends, he understood why Julia would want all memory of them destroyed.</p><p>He ran a finger across the back of her hand, caressing the knuckles. \u201cYou have a home and family now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She gave him a little smile, but it didn\u2019t touch her eyes.</p><p>She looked in vain for her mother\u2019s engagement and wedding rings. But they\u2019d likely been pawned long ago. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d seen them.</p><p>If Julia had expected to find answers among her mother\u2019s things, she was sorely disappointed. The materials they found didn\u2019t explain why Sharon decided that the baby girl she initially loved to distraction became an annoying household presence. They didn\u2019t explain how alcohol and sex became more important than flesh and blood.</p><p>\u201cDarling?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice broke into her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cA whole life. Three boxes. What a waste.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rubbed her back sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she love me?\u201d Julia croaked.</p><p>Gabriel felt as if his heart were being torn apart. He sat behind her, pulling her back against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had an answer. All I can say is that I understand. Believe me, Julianne, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to believe she ever loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe kept the photographs. It\u2019s clear she loved you when you were born. You can see it in her face. She loved you after that, too, when you were little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she loved alcohol more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an addiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not without compassion, Gabriel, but I can\u2019t contemplate choosing alcohol and men over my child.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s grip on her tightened. \u201cThat\u2019s as it should be. But you\u2019ve never struggled with addiction, Julianne. That\u2019s something I know too much about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there were times your mother wanted to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were times she went into recovery, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere but for the grace of God go we,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he continued in a whisper, \u201cThis is my fault. I\u2019m the one who insisted on looking into our parents, and now see what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the one who hurt me.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it was silly to think I\u2019d find an explanation in one of these boxes. If my dad doesn\u2019t have one, how could there be an explanation in a pile of junk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour baby things aren\u2019t junk. We\u2019ll frame the photos and put the other things on a shelf. Someday, if we have a little girl, you can show her how beautiful her mama looked when she was a baby.\u201d</p><p>Julia pressed her face into the crook of his neck. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a tight squeeze, holding her until she was ready to pack up the boxes.</p><p>Chapter Forty-six</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat that?\u201d Julia stared wide-eyed at her gynecologist.</p><p>It was the third week in September and Julia had just had her yearly physical exam. It was supposed to be routine, with a view to uncovering any fertility issues. But the doctor\u2019s remarks indicated that the exam had been anything but routine.</p><p>\u201cI want you to have an ultrasound. My secretary will contact radiology at Mount Auburn Hospital and schedule the appointment. I want you seen immediately, and I\u2019m noting that in my referral.\u201d Dr. Rubio scribbled hastily in Julia\u2019s chart.</p><p>Julia\u2019s stomach flipped. \u201cSo it\u2019s serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPotentially serious.\u201d The doctor paused, her dark eyes meeting Julia\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you came in when you did. I found something on one of your ovaries. We need to know what it is. You\u2019ll have an ultrasound, the radiologist will write up a report and send it to me, and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCancer?\u201d Julia could barely pronounce the word.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a possibility.

It\u2019s imperative that we have you looked at right away.\u201d</p><p>Julia sat very, very still.</p><p>All she could think about was Grace.</p> <p>\u201cDarling, I\u2019m in the middle of my seminar. Can I call you back?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice was low as he answered his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I forgot. I\u2019ll just see you at home.\u201d Julia was flustered and fighting back tears. She could hear footsteps on the other end of the line and the closing of the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the hallway now. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home. I\u2019ll see you soon. Please apologize to your students for me.\u201d Julia disconnected before she began sobbing. Somehow the sound of his voice, patient and sweet, made everything worse.</p><p>She buried her face in her hands just as her cell phone rang. She didn\u2019t have to look at it to know who was calling.</p> <p>\u201cH-hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you at dinner.\u201d She hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll tell me now, or I\u2019ll cancel my seminar and come and find you. You\u2019re worrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor found something during my exam.\u201d</p><p>Silence emerged from the other end of the line.</p> <p>She could hear Gabriel inhale sharply.</p><p>\u201cFound what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor doesn\u2019t know. I\u2019m supposed to go for an ultrasound at Mount Auburn Hospital as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Julia did her best to lie convincingly.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m walking home from the doctor\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay where you are. I\u2019ll come and get you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to cancel your seminar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t teach a class knowing that you\u2019re alone and crying. Stay there and I\u2019ll call you back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m just in shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t fine. Just give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost home. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>She disconnected the phone.</p><p>Gabriel cursed, then opened the door to his seminar room to cancel his class.</p><p>In the days between Julia\u2019s appointment with her doctor and her ultrasound, Gabriel received a call from his urologist indicating that his sperm production was normal. Professor Emerson was gloriously fertile.</p><p>(Parenthetically, it should be noted that he never doubted his fertility.)</p><p>His relief was overshadowed by the anxiety he felt over Julia. He put on a brave face, not wanting to upset her, but inwardly, he was afraid.</p><p>She was young. She was healthy. Of course, Grace had been young and healthy prior to her diagnosis. She\u2019d had breast cancer for some time before it was discovered.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s virility and strength was such that he rarely, if ever, felt helpless. But gazing at his beloved wife while she tossed and turned night after night made him feel impotent. She was light and life and love and goodness. And it was possible she was very, very sick.</p><p>Gabriel closed his eyes and prayed.</p><p>\u201cSweetie?\u201d Her voice came out of the darkness.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to promise me something.\u201d</p><p>He rolled to his side so he could see her better.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise that if anything happens to me, you\u2019ll take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say such things.\u201d His tone was unnecessarily sharp.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Gabriel. Whether my time is soon or when I\u2019m old and gray. I want you to promise that you\u2019ll continue on the path that you\u2019re on. That you\u2019ll be a good man, that you\u2019ll live a good life and that you\u2019ll try to find happiness.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel felt as if he were choking as a myriad of emotions bubbled up into his throat.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t find happiness without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found peace without me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou found peace in Assisi. You can live without me. We both know that you can.\u201d</p><p>He placed his palm on top of her stomach, his fingers stroking her naked skin.</p><p>\u201cHow can a man live without his heart?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hand over his.</p><p>\u201cRichard does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard is a shell of his former self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to promise me. I worry that you\u2019ve made so much of me that if something were to happen, you\u2019d . . .\u201d She trailed off.</p><p>\u201cI will always struggle with addiction, Julianne, but I don\u2019t think I could go back to my old life.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cThen I truly would be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise that wherever I am, I\u2019ll do all that I can to help you. I swear.\u201d Her voice was a desperate whisper.</p><p>\u201cIf you were Francis to my Guido da Montefeltro, you\u2019d come for my soul, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear it. But I don\u2019t believe your soul is in mortal danger.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand and traced the curve of her cheekbone with his thumb. \u201cNo more morbid talk. If it\u2019s necessary to your peace of mind to make this promise, then I promise. But don\u2019t you dare leave me.\u201d</p><p>Julia nodded against his hand, her body relaxing.</p><p>Chapter Forty-seven</p><p>On the day of Julia\u2019s ultrasound, Gabriel canceled his classes in order to accompany her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but you aren\u2019t allowed inside the ultrasound suite.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood to his full height, a scowl distorting his handsome features. He looked down at the much shorter technician. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>The technician pointed at a notice board that was affixed to the wall. \u201cOnly the patient is allowed. Family must wait out here.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel placed his hands on his hips, fanning his jacket out angrily. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife. I\u2019m not leaving her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe average ultrasound only takes thirty minutes. She\u2019ll be with you soon.\u201d The technician nodded at Julia. \u201cMrs. Emerson, if you\u2019ll follow me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tugged on Julia\u2019s arm, stopping her. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to another hospital.\u201d</p><p>Julia shifted her weight from foot to foot, practically dancing in the hallway. \u201cThey made me drink five cups of water. I have to pee like crazy. Don\u2019t make me go through this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go in there alone.\u201d His eyes, flashing blue fire, rested on hers.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t wait.\u201d Her tone pierced him.</p><p>He blinked a few times.</p><p>\u201cWhat if there\u2019s a problem?\u201d</p><p>The technician cleared her throat and nodded toward the same sign. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to discuss what I find. Only the radiologist can write up an official report, and that will be sent directly to your doctor.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel muttered a few choice expletives and gave the technician a glare that nearly knocked her over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, sweetie. But if you don\u2019t want to see my bladder explode right in front of you, you have to let me go.\u201d Julia crossed her legs.</p><p>Gabriel watched her walk away, feeling furious and helpless simultaneously.</p><p>Two days later, Julia was summoned to Dr. Rubio\u2019s office to discuss the radiologist\u2019s report. Gabriel accompanied her.</p><p>\u201cFibroids,\u201d the doctor announced triumphantly. \u201cI read the report and I saw the ultrasound. I concur with her findings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a fibroid?\u201d Julia clutched Gabriel\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cA fibroid is a benign growth on or in the uterus. They\u2019re very common. According to the report, you have two of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo?\u201d Julia sounded panicked. \u201cBut I thought you only found one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found the bigger one during your pelvic exam. Because it\u2019s attached to the exterior of your uterus, I thought it was part of your ovary. There\u2019s also a small one lower down on the front of your uterus.\u201d Doctor Rubio quickly sketched Julia\u2019s insides while Gabriel tried valiantly not to faint.</p><p>(One must remember that his vast knowledge of uteri was primarily experiential rather than visual.)</p><p>\u201cThe larger one is about five centimeters. The smaller one is about three centimeters.\u201d She pointed to her drawing with a pen.</p><p>Julia felt queasy and looked away.</p><p>\u201cWill she need surgery?\u201d Gabriel ignored the sketch and made eye contact with the doctor.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Dr. Rubio turned to her patient. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t bothering you, we\u2019re inclined to leave them. We\u2019ll put you on birth control pills. The hormones in the pill slow the growth of the fibroid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about fertility?\u201d</p><p>Doctor Rubio glanced at the chart. \u201cAh, yes. You want to try to start a family in a few years. We\u2019ll monitor your fibroids, but since they\u2019re located on the outside of the uterus, I don\u2019t think fertility will be a problem. However, once you\u2019re pregnant we\u2019ll have to keep an eye on them. Fibroids tend to grow during pregnancy because of the rise in hormone levels. They can crowd the uterus and cause premature delivery. We\u2019ll monitor all of that when the time comes. But for now, I take this to be good news. I\u2019m going to ask that we schedule you for another ultrasound in about six months, simply to check the fibroids. I\u2019ll write up a prescription for you to go on the pill. And we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>Julia and Gabriel exchanged a look, then thanked the doctor and exited the office.</p><p>Later that night, Gabriel lay awake, staring at the ceiling, an inexplicable feeling of dread hanging over him.</p><p>Careful not to wake Julia, he crept out of bed and walked down the hall to the study. He switched on the light, closed the door, and went to his desk.</p><p>Within a few minutes, his laptop was on and he was Googling \u201cfibroids.\u201d He clicked on a page that looked promising and began viewing a few photographs of fibroids being removed during surgery.</p><p>Then he promptly passed out.</p><p>Chapter Forty-eight</p><p>Gabriel was fortunate enough to have his vasectomy reversal scheduled for the first week in October. Now it was Julia\u2019s turn to miss a class and accompany him to the hospital.</p><p>The morning of his surgery, she awoke to the sound of Peggy Lee singing \u201cFever.\u201d It wasn\u2019t Gabriel\u2019s normal choice of morning music, but it sounded promising. She pulled on her robe and walked to the bathroom.</p><p>Gabriel was standing in front of the vanity, shaving. His dark hair was damp from the shower, its edges curling. He was naked to the waist, a dark blue towel slung low on his hips. Julia wanted to trace the top of the V that extended below the towel.</p><p>As was his custom, he used a shaving brush to mix soap into a lather, spreading it over his face. His sapphire eyes were focused behind his glasses as he lifted the safety razor and began.</p><p>\u201cLurking about in doorways, Mrs. Emerson?\u201d He spoke without turning his head.</p><p>\u201cI came to see what was giving you a fever.\u201d</p><p>He paused and gave her a searing look. \u201cI think you know the answer to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what raises my temperature. There\u2019s nothing sexier than watching the man you love shave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rinsed his razor. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think that, because it\u2019s a daily essential.\u201d His eyes gleamed. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve grown attached to my stubble. As I recall, you seemed to enjoy it last night.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darted in the direction of her thighs.</p><p>She felt her cheeks flame.

You\u2019ll have to give me something to tide me over for the next three weeks.\u201d</p><p>He continued his ritual, the razor moving expertly.</p> <p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d She approached him and pressed an openmouthed kiss between his shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cI think we should wait until after I\u2019ve finished. You\u2019re distracting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She kissed him again, this time wrapping her hands over the tops of his shoulders, feeling the muscles tense beneath her fingers.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help myself, Professor. I love touching you.\u201d</p><p>She traced the lines of his biceps, moving to his forearms, admiring muscle and sinew. She pressed her lips to the hills and valley of his spine before tracing the dimples that winked at her above the edge of the towel.</p> <p>He placed a heavy hand on top of the vanity.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t shave while you\u2019re touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I should do it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d A heated look passed between them.</p><p>\u201cYou enjoy feeding me. Perhaps I\u2019d enjoy shaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very provocative this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I need a sexy memory to get me through our marital celibacy.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel put his razor aside and gestured in front of him, a look of amusement on his face.</p> <p>She moved into the gap, facing him. In one swift moment, he lifted her to sit on the counter.</p><p>He spread her knees, pushing her robe out of the way. Then he stood between her legs.</p><p>His eyes drifted down. \u201cNo panties this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten that far yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for me.\u201d He smiled while his fingers fumbled with the knot at her waist. \u201cLucky for us your cycle hasn\u2019t started yet.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands over his, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cWill you teach me to shave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaving is overrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do this for you.\u201d</p><p>He made a show of sighing, as if his patience were being tested. Then he picked up the razor. \u201cShave with the direction the hair grows, but don\u2019t apply pressure. The blade is very sharp.\u201d</p><p>He stepped away, looking in the mirror as he demonstrated his technique. Satisfied with his display, he rinsed the razor before placing it in her hand.</p><p>She looked at him. Then she looked at the razor, at the blade that gleamed in the halogen light.</p><p>\u201cStage fright, Mrs. Emerson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll make you bleed.\u201d</p><p>His eyes bore into hers. \u201cThen you know how I felt your first time.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s heart rate increased at the memory. He\u2019d been very worried that night, but very, very gentle.</p><p>He pressed his lips to her wrist, drawing on the skin. \u201cYou\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>He separated the edges of her robe before pushing the silk over her shoulders. Then he placed his palm between her breasts, feeling her heartbeat.</p><p>Julia arched an eyebrow. \u201cYou want me to shave you, half\u2013 naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He moved his mouth to her ear and dropped his voice to a throaty whisper. \u201cI want you to shave me completely naked.\u201d</p><p>He took his time unfastening her belt, as if he were unwrapping a gift. Then he stood between her knees again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing sexier than having the woman you love shave you, while you enjoy her body.\u201d</p><p>Julia shuddered as the cooler air swirled around her heated skin. She placed her left hand on his shoulder to steady herself.</p><p>He nodded and she began.</p><p>The safety razor glided simply and easily over his skin without any need for pressure. All the while, two sapphire eyes focused on her.</p><p>He placed his hands at her waist and began stroking her hip bones with his thumbs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d She rinsed the razor. \u201cI\u2019ll nick you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it would be an exercise in self-control for both of us.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips traced a path up to her breasts, circling them lightly. When she moaned, he slid his hands back to her waist.</p><p>\u201cI like the feel of your skin under my hands.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and returned to what she was doing, trying to ignore the feel of his fingers gliding over her abdomen and between her breasts. He began to tease her nipples, which were extremely sensitive.</p><p>\u201cI guess you must trust me,\u201d she ground out, trying to keep her hand steady.</p><p>He stroked a finger over the prominent peaks. \u201cI do, Julianne. More than I\u2019ve ever trusted anyone.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were tender, their blue intensity communicating far more than his words could. \u201cBut I can\u2019t see you and not touch you.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her breasts, cradling them gently in deference to her forthcoming cycle.</p><p>Patiently, she worked the razor over the parts of his face that were yet unshaven while he fondled and teased her. Her breathing grew shallow.</p><p>He dropped his hands to her inner thighs, where the skin was slightly sensitive from being teased by his stubble. He moved higher, inch by tantalizing inch.</p><p>With a few last strokes of the razor, she pulled back to admire her handiwork. \u201cI think we\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lightly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She put the razor aside, leaning back on her hands.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019re finished yet.\u201d His eyes glinted as he moved to the juncture of her thighs. His thumbs tangled in her curls.</p><p>She licked her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cThen drop the towel, Professor.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s procedure was unremarkable. What was remarkable, however, was the grimness of the surgeon\u2019s face when he came to see Julia in the waiting room.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Emerson.\u201d He greeted her, moving to sit in the empty chair beside her.</p><p>She closed her laptop. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe surgery went well. It was complicated, but nothing unexpected. We also retrieved some sperm and froze it, as your husband directed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel said that you have a very high success rate.\u201d Julia sounded hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI do. Some of my patients have conceived a child as early as three months after the procedure. But every case is different.\u201d The doctor\u2019s expression grew serious. \u201cDuring surgery, your husband had a reaction to the anesthesia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reaction? Is he all right?\u201d Julia\u2019s heart began to race.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, but he\u2019s been vomiting. He\u2019s on intravenous and I want him to stay overnight. He\u2019s in recovery now, then they\u2019ll move him to a room. I\u2019ll make sure someone comes to get you so you can stay with him.\u201d</p><p>The surgeon eyed Julia\u2019s worried expression.</p><p>\u201cThese kinds of reactions to general anesthesia are not uncommon. We\u2019ll monitor him as a precaution, and he\u2019ll probably be ready to go home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The doctor patted her hand and disappeared through a set of swinging doors.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d Julia whispered.</p><p>He\u2019d been moaning and thrashing a little in his hospital bed. She leaned over to take his hand.</p><p>\u201cSweetie? The surgery went well. You\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened suddenly.</p><p>She pushed his hair back from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cI feel like a baby. I feel like hell, actually. Dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be sick?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cTired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go to sleep, darling. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty baby,\u201d he mumbled, before drifting into sleep.</p><p>Julia pressed her lips to his forehead.</p><p>I love this man with all my heart. I\u2019d give my life for him. I\u2019d give anything for him.</p><p>It was unusual to see Gabriel as he appeared in the hospital bed. He rarely, if ever, got sick. When he wasn\u2019t asleep, the strength of his presence dominated his surroundings.</p><p>Now his personality was muted. Quiet. Vulnerable.</p><p>She thought back to the time when she\u2019d cared for the Professor while he was drunk. She\u2019d helped him to his apartment and he\u2019d vomited all over her.</p><p>(And his British racing green cashmere sweater.)</p><p>She remembered dragging him to the bathroom and cleaning him up. She ran her fingers through his hair, wondering what it would be like to have a baby to care for. At the time, such musings seemed so remote, so unattainable.</p><p>Gazing down on the handsome face of her beloved husband, she knew that something inside her was shifting. Something had changed.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Rebecca eyed Julia with concern as she entered the kitchen the following afternoon.</p><p>Julia placed a tray on the counter. \u201cHe\u2019s asleep. He says he\u2019s uncomfortable, but he wouldn\u2019t take his pain pills until I threatened him.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca laughed. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>Julia placed the dirty dishes in the sink. \u201cI reminded him that the longer he took to heal, the longer he\u2019d have to wait for sex. He grabbed the pill bottle out of my hand. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have trouble getting him to take his medication anymore.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca shook her head, smothering a smile.</p><p>\u201cChicken soup for dinner with homemade rolls. How does that sound?\u201d She moved to the stove, where she was simmering an entire chicken in a stockpot.</p><p>\u201cDelicious. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you need me to stay this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Julia looked at Rebecca with interest. \u201cWould you do that?\u201d</p><p>Rebecca placed the lid back on the stockpot. \u201cOf course. I can be here whenever you need me, except during the holidays. And even then, if I had advance notice, I could work something out. It might sound silly, but I think of you two as family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t silly. We think the same.\u201d Julia leaned against the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier when you\u2019re here. Dirty clothing disappears and clean clothing appears in its place. There\u2019s always food in the fridge or freezer and the house is immaculate. I\u2019d never be able to do what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, you could. But you couldn\u2019t be a student, too. You\u2019d have to choose one or the other. Are your brother-in-law and his family still coming to visit?\u201d</p><p>Rebecca wiped her hands on her apron and moved to the kitchen island. An iPad was propped up on a stand, like a cookbook. She opened the iCalendar application and scrolled through it, looking at the Emersons\u2019 appointments. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Between my ultrasound and Gabriel\u2019s surgery, we decided it would be best if they came after Christmas. We\u2019ll be going home for Thanksgiving, anyway.\u201d Julia winced in remembrance. \u201cI thought I mentioned it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca waved her hand in the air. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll adjust the calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Gabriel to be so weak after his procedure. He insists he\u2019s going to work tomorrow, but I don\u2019t see how he can. He\u2019s in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen make the worst patients. They don\u2019t take their medication, they don\u2019t do what they\u2019re told, and they never, ever admit they\u2019re sick. They\u2019re like cats.\u201d</p> <p>Julia chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s probably easier to give a pill to a cat than to a man. Then again, a man can\u2019t scratch you.\u201d</p><p>Now Julia was laughing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing he\u2019s upstairs. He\u2019d be cross with us for comparing him to a cat.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca winked. \u201cMeow.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Forty-nine</p><p>The week following Gabriel\u2019s surgery, he was almost back to his old self. Except that he was grumpy and cross because of the lack of sex.</p><p>(One might observe that being grumpy and cross was precisely his old self.)</p><p>Julia bore his grumpiness as she usually did, with saintlike good humor. Of course, the fact that she was getting regular orgasms courtesy of her husband might have had something to do with her mood.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a letter from Katherine.\u201d Gabriel waved in the direction of the kitchen table, where the day\u2019s mail was stacked.</p><p>Julia picked up the small white envelope. Sure enough, the letter was from Professor Katherine Picton of All Souls College, Oxford.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s still in England. I would have thought she\u2019d be back in Toronto by now.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pulled up a chair and began going through the rest of the mail, hoping that there wouldn\u2019t be any surprises among it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a fellow at All Souls for the year. Open it and see what she says.\u201d</p><p>Julia put on her glasses, opened the envelope, and began to read.</p><p>Dear Gabriel and Julianne,</p><p>I hope that this letter finds you both well.</p><p>Oxford is enjoyable and I\u2019m pleased with the research I\u2019ve been able to accomplish. I look back fondly to the conference this past summer and hope to see you soon.</p><p>I mentioned this before, but Greg Matthews has invited me to give a series of lectures at Harvard at the end of January. I\u2019m told he\u2019s also invited Jeremy Martin to give a paper.</p> <p>I\u2019m hoping to see you both during my visit.</p><p>I\u2019m also hoping you\u2019ll save me from Greg\u2019s dreadful culinary predilections.</p><p>As ever,</p><p>Katherine.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she say?\u201d Gabriel looked at his wife over the rims of his glasses.</p><p>\u201cShe says she\u2019s coming to Harvard in January. I haven\u2019t heard anything about that in the department. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard a formal announcement. What else does she say?\u201d</p><p>Julia handed him the letter.</p><p>Gabriel perused its contents quickly.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cJeremy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the letter back onto the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to that confrontation. He\u2019s still angry I resigned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you smooth things over with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We were friends for a while, and then we weren\u2019t. We\u2019ll see.\u201d He pushed her hair behind her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. The important thing is that we\u2019ll be able to see Katherine and have her over for dinner. She doesn\u2019t like Greg\u2019s choice of restaurants.\u201d</p><p>Julia folded her glasses and placed them on the kitchen table before climbing into Gabriel\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine Katherine having a tawdry affair with an old, desiccated Oxford professor.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel chuckled. \u201cNeither can I. But Old Hut was considered handsome in his day. I\u2019ve seen photographs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the two of them together. She had to know it was wrong\u2014not only because of her career but because he was married.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tapped the end of her nose. \u201cI think she loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we did was wrong as well, if you remember.\u201d He lowered his voice, his eyes focused on hers intently.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She placed her arms around his neck. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s easy to point fingers and forget one\u2019s own failings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she felt one tenth the love I felt for you, well, I can understand how she was led astray. Now that I\u2019m married, however, I feel sympathy for Mrs. Hutton. If someone were to try to lure you away\u2014\u201d He cursed.</p><p>\u201cI love you more now than I did before we were married.\u201d Julia wore a contemplative expression. \u201cMarriage is the strangest thing. Almost without realizing it, I feel as if our lives and our hearts became knitted together. I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage is a sacrament.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s tone was solemn. \u201cAnd of course, there\u2019s the sex we\u2019re no longer having.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe three weeks are almost up.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel moved his mouth to her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better inform your professors that you won\u2019t be in class that day.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at his nearness.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll let you leave the house after going without you for three weeks?\u201d He nipped at her ear. \u201cYou\u2019ll be lucky if I let you leave the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d She rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cI know that alongside our medical appointments, you were making inquiries about your family history. Have you found out anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Carson to look into things. He was supposed to get a copy of the coroner\u2019s report on my mother, and also health information about her parents and my father and his parents. But I haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is going to give your lawyer that kind of information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d said Gabriel grimly. \u201cBut he\u2019s been known to hire private investigators that tend to be persuasive. They\u2019ll find out what I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersuasive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case the information can probably be bought. Failing that, people can be made to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel.\u201d Julia\u2019s tone was reproachful. \u201cHave you ever bought information like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His swift, unblinking answer surprised her.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel remorse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was doing it for you. That\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What kind of information did you get?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. You\u2019d best get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Julia resisted the urge to move and remained where she was, in his lap.</p><p>\u201cI should mention that although I didn\u2019t intend to tell you what happened, for the past few months it\u2019s been nagging at me that I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow I ensured that Simon and Natalie would never bother you again.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes widened as Gabriel began his story.</p><p>Chapter Fifty</p><p>April 2010</p><p>Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s cell phone rang. He reached over to pick it up so he could see who was calling. Julianne had called several times since he\u2019d left her in Toronto. Although he listened to her voice messages in an effort to torture himself, he couldn\u2019t risk answering and actually speaking with her.</p><p>July first. If I can just hold on until July first, she\u2019ll be safe.</p><p>The display indicated that the number was blocked. Gabriel had a fair idea who was calling.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cFound the girl. Found her boyfriend. We need to meet.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rubbed at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you look after this? That\u2019s what I\u2019m paying you for.\u201d</p><p>Jack cursed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust you. Tom tells me you broke my niece\u2019s heart. I should be tuning you up rather than doing a job for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t for me. It\u2019s for her,\u201d Gabriel snapped. \u201cThe girl tried to blackmail her. The boy fucking bit her and threatened to rape her. How is it in those scenarios, I\u2019m the villain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelrose Diner, South Philly, tomorrow at nine A.M.\u201d</p><p>Jack hung up.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d said Gabriel.</p><p>Jack Mitchell was a private investigator. At least, that was the occupation he put on his tax forms. He was an ex-Marine who also worked in private security, investigations, and enforcement.</p><p>Simply put, he helped rich individuals stay safe from all kinds of threats, including blackmail.</p><p>Jack was Tom Mitchell\u2019s younger brother and the man that he turned to when his friend Richard Clark needed to pay off the drug dealers his son owed. Jack and a few of his contacts took the money Richard provided (money that was gained by mortgaging the family home in Selinsgrove) and persuaded the dealers to forget the name of Gabriel Emerson.</p><p>Jack could be very persuasive.</p><p>When Gabriel needed someone to persuade a certain couple to stay away from Julianne, he immediately thought of Jack. Contacting him wasn\u2019t easy, but a few well-placed phone calls put them in touch.</p><p>Despite Jack\u2019s initial resistance, when he saw the photographs of Julianne\u2019s injuries at the hands of the senator\u2019s son, he agreed to take the job. He followed Simon and the redhead he was banging as they cut a wide swath through Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. In a short period of time, Jack had a dossier thick enough to share with Emerson. And damning enough (he thought) to ensure that his niece would no longer have to worry about the rich boy and the redhead.</p><p>Jack would make suggestions about how to use the information to its greatest effect. And he hoped that he\u2019d be able to call his shot at a few minutes alone with the rich kid. Someone needed to teach that motherfucker a lesson.</p><p>Jack slid a manila envelope across the table to Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cLeverage to get them to turn over the stuff they have on Jules. I\u2019ll have a conversation with them about what will happen if they don\u2019t. Senator Talbot is making a bid for the White House. They\u2019ll comply. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d Gabriel flipped through a set of black-and-white photos, all of which featured the senator\u2019s son involved in some kind of sex act. Some of the photos featured him and two women. All of them turned Gabriel\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cDebutantes, Capitol Hill brats, and an intern from the senator\u2019s office.\u201d Jack placed his index finger over the pale, shadowed face of a young woman.</p><p>Gabriel frowned in distaste. \u201cCollege student?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderage?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Gabriel muttered. \u201cThe guy is a predator. Is the senator implicated?\u2019</p><p>\u201cHis people are aware the kid is a problem. They\u2019ve been tailing him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut they haven\u2019t done anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing on radar. Don\u2019t see how they can let this continue. The kid gave alcohol and drugs to a seventeen-year-old and then slept with her. It\u2019s all on film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker.\u201d Gabriel placed the photos back in the envelope and slid it across the table.</p><p>\u201cReturning your fee.\u201d Jack tucked the photos inside his leather jacket and then took a business-sized envelope from one of the pockets. He held it out.</p> <p>Gabriel waved it aside.</p><p>Jack dropped the envelope next to Gabriel\u2019s coffee mug.</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t your problem anymore.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel leveled angry blue eyes on the man sitting across from him.</p><p>\u201cShe will always be my problem.\u201d</p> <p>Jack squinted.</p><p>\u201cMan like you, spends thousands on white stuff that goes up his nose. Nearly gets himself and his father killed. Shit.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fucking delighted you aren\u2019t with her anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take the money.\u201d Gabriel clenched his fist and inhaled deeply, resisting the urge to bounce Jack\u2019s head off the table.</p><p>\u201cTom should have solved this problem. Way I look at it, he fell down on the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the first time. If you\u2019re so sympathetic to Julianne, why the hell didn\u2019t you rescue her from her mother? You could have saved her the scar on the back of her head.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s face grew very red. \u201cShe told you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel glared. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand, but for reasons I won\u2019t delineate, we can\u2019t be together. I\u2019d still walk through Hell for her. And I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to let some motherfucker with a senator for a father embarrass and humiliate her. You don\u2019t want the money of a cokehead who broke your niece\u2019s heart? Fine. Do your job and do it right, or I\u2019ll find someone who will.\u201d Gabriel stuffed the envelope into his pocket and moved to stand.</p><p>Jack held out his hand to stop him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you when it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I expect you to keep this conversation between us.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked up at him in surprise. \u201cDon\u2019t you want her to know?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression tightened. \u201cThe important thing is that she\u2019s safe. No blackmail, no blowback. They stay out of her life forever. And she gets to sleep peacefully at night.\u201d</p> <p>A long look passed between the two men before Gabriel strode out of the diner.</p><p>Chapter Fifty-one</p><p>October 2011</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</p><p>Scheisse,\u201d said Julia.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d said Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you hired my uncle Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good at what he does. He\u2019s gotten me out of scrapes before.\u201d</p><p>A sudden realization came upon her. \u201cIs that what you were arguing with him about back at my dad\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was angry I\u2019d never told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never mentioned anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man of few words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d She looked at him reproachfully.</p><p>\u201cMy actions were justified, but not legal. I didn\u2019t want you knowing anything about it if there was a chance Simon or Natalie decided to go to the police. Or the feds. Before we were married I told you I\u2019d looked into them and was satisfied that they wouldn\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you threatened them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it really so bad?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Julia met his gaze and saw thinly disguised disappointment in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI told you I hadn\u2019t confessed everything from my past, Julianne. We agreed that was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my father was so angry with you. Didn\u2019t you want him to know that you protected me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fewer people who knew about it, the better. I doubt he would have changed his opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo while we were separated, you were working hard to make sure I was safe?\u201d She blinked back tears. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her tightly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You should know that when I recovered the photos and videos of you I destroyed them without looking at them.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s shoulders sagged in relief. \u201cBut Uncle Jack saw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he took pains not to look. And they\u2019re gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon and Natalie probably kept copies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack said he got everything that included you. And he has a few other things in case he needs to motivate Natalie or Simon in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he get everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important. The important thing is that you don\u2019t need to worry about them. They won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p><p>Julia hugged him, crying relieved tears on his shoulder.</p><p>Chapter Fifty-two</p><p>October 2011</p><p>Durham, North Carolina</p><p>What are you doing?\u201d April padded into her kitchen on bare feet, clad only in her boyfriend\u2019s dress shirt.</p><p>He was standing at the stove cooking bacon and eggs in a single pan.</p><p>\u201cMaking us breakfast.\u201d He smiled at her and reached over to peck her lips. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She stretched her arms over her head, then giggled. \u201cI sleep better with you than without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he admitted, more to himself than to her.</p><p>She grabbed a container of orange juice from the refrigerator and poured them each a glass.</p><p>\u201cI sleep better with you, but I feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty?\u201d Simon turned, holding the spatula in his hand. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>April ducked her head, focusing on her orange juice. \u201cBecause we\u2019re sleeping together and we aren\u2019t married.\u201d</p><p>Simon froze.</p><p>Chastity was as foreign to him as Eastern Europe. He\u2019d encountered it before, in Julia, but it had always been something annoying and stupid, something he\u2019d wanted to destroy through either seduction or manipulation.</p><p>With April, he found himself feeling something entirely different. Something that might have been the twinges of remorse.</p><p>It was a new experience for him.</p><p>\u201cSex isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a funny thing to say.\u201d She tapped her finger against her juice glass. \u201cYou\u2019ve taught me sex is very, very good. I love it and I love being with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was taught to wait. And I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Simon turned back to the stove, at a loss as to what to say. For a moment, he continued cooking breakfast, then turned off the burner and put the pan aside.</p><p>He wiped his hands on the seat of his boxer shorts and walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cYou were taught to wait because your parents didn\u2019t want some asshole taking advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d Her tone was scolding. \u201cDon\u2019t cuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Your parents were trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just my parents. It\u2019s my church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they were trying to protect you, too. And that\u2019s a good thing. But our situation is different.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He put his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cHow is it different?\u201d She sounded cautious. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just having fun here. I like having sex with you, but I also enjoy your company. I can let my guard down when I\u2019m with you. I don\u2019t have to be Senator Talbot\u2019s son. I can just be myself.\u201d He smiled somewhat hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel, too.\u201d She snuggled into his chest. \u201cBut every time you leave, I feel bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because we care about each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish we could stay like this forever,\u201d she whispered, her arms tightening around his waist.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he admitted. He was stunned to discover that his words were true. That even in the short time he\u2019d known her, he\u2019d come to care for her, deeply. Their relationship was easy and good and he couldn\u2019t imagine ending it.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Simon.\u201d</p><p>Simon felt his heart jump into his throat.</p><p>He was not a stupid man. He knew what he had in his arms\u2014a beautiful, gentle, amazing young woman. She didn\u2019t have the baggage that he carried. She wasn\u2019t jaded and intent on social climbing, like Natalie. And she wasn\u2019t fearful and self-righteous, like Julia. Julia had always made him feel as if he were an animal, something unworthy to touch her.</p><p>April probably woke up that morning, decided she loved him, and simply told him. No deliberation, no head games, no social climbing through sexual means.</p><p>Without warning, Simon found his lips moving.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>April hugged him as tightly as she could, almost bouncing on the balls of her feet.</p><p>\u201cThis is great!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d He smiled down at her youthful, uninhibited exuberance and kissed her.</p><p>Chapter Fifty-three</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</p><p>As October came to an end, the date Gabriel was waiting for drew near. He\u2019d been fantasizing about what he was going to do to Julianne once their required celibacy ended, planning their activities meticulously.</p><p>The afternoon before the date, Julia stood in the kitchen of their home and called him. The phone rang only twice before he answered.</p><p>\u201cHello, gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. It never ceased to amaze her how, with a word or two, he could increase her heart rate and cause her skin to heat.</p><p>\u201cHello, handsome. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust picking up a few things. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt home.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel paused, and Julia could hear the sound of a car door slam. \u201cYou\u2019re home early. I wasn\u2019t expecting you until six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Marinelli canceled her seminar because she has laryngitis. I think I\u2019m going to go upstairs and have a shower. Then I might take a nap until you get home. I was up really early this morning.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the Range Rover roaring to life filled Julia\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cYou do that. I\u2019ll be home soon. See you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Julia heard what sounded like a chuckle before Gabriel disconnected. She wondered what he found so funny.</p><p>She poked around in the kitchen for a few minutes, noticing that Rebecca hadn\u2019t prepared anything for dinner. She wondered why.</p><p>Perplexed, she climbed the stairs to the second floor. She didn\u2019t bother to hang up her clothes but simply dropped them in the bedroom before entering the shower.</p><p>A hot shower would revitalize her after an exhausting day.</p><p>She\u2019d almost finished her shower when she heard the shower door open.</p><p>\u201cWhy, hello there.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood in front of her, naked and smiling. He leaned forward to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cDid you need a shower too?\u201d she asked, trying not to ogle him and failing miserably.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just wanted to be where you are.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him again. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She ran an appreciative hand down the center of his chest to the deep V that bracketed his hips. Then she switched off the shower, squeezing the water out of her hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel retrieved a towel and handed it to her.</p><p>That was when she noticed the way his eyes were alit in anticipation, his smile growing wider.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you forget what day it is?\u201d He trailed a finger down her arm.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Our special day is tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn. I\u2019ve waited long enough. A man can only stand so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d She cocked her head to one side.</p> <p>\u201cSo prepare to be pleasured, my dear.\u201d</p><p>She quickly ran the towel over her body, drying herself, then wound it over her hair.</p><p>Gabriel picked up a glass jar and held it out to her.</p><p>\u201cChocolate Body Paint,\u201d she read. She glanced up at him. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d He wiggled a small paintbrush under her nose. \u201cYou said that you enjoyed our foray into body painting while we were in Selinsgrove. I decided we should try it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you\u2019d want to do other things. You\u2019ve been doing things for me for three weeks. I\u2019ve been able to do very little for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForeplay is for me as well as you,\u201d he whispered, his eyes darkening. \u201cAnd I have plans for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She breathed.</p><p>\u201cI thought about trying it in the bedroom, but things could get messy.\u201d</p><p>He crouched in front of her, his face level with her navel, and opened the jar. He dipped the paintbrush in the chocolate, spreading the confection liberally over the delicate strands of the brush, before winking up at her.</p><p>\u201cShall we begin?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her eyes half closed.</p><p>Slowly, he began to draw a heart around her navel.</p><p>The feel of the chocolate and the brush gliding across her warm skin caused her to fidget. And of course, despite the fact that it almost tickled, Gabriel would not be rushed.</p> <p>\u201cThere.\u201d He put the jar and brush aside and licked his lips. \u201cNow comes the fun part. Ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word came out as more of a squeak than a statement.</p><p>She reached out a shaking hand to grasp a railing when Gabriel\u2019s tongue made contact with her skin, swirling through the chocolate and dipping into her navel.</p><p>He steadied her by splaying one of his hands across her backside.</p><p>\u201cIt tastes better than I expected.\u201d He nibbled at her. \u201cThen again, that\u2019s probably because I like how you taste.\u201d</p><p>His tongue blazed a trail to her hip bone, where he began placing openmouthed kisses.</p><p>\u201cI think we need more chocolate. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Julia nodded furiously. \u201cDefinitely, more.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel picked up the chocolate and the brush.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better hold on tight, darling, because I\u2019m planning to be thorough.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward, cupping his chin.</p><p>\u201cAs am I.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifty-four</p><p>As November progressed, Diane and Tom continued to receive positive reports about their baby\u2019s health. Surgery would still be necessary, but the baby was developing and Diane was also healthy.</p><p>Julia received the reports about her brother with a combination of relief and cautious optimism.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t told her family about her fibroids or about Gabriel\u2019s vasectomy reversal. His family didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d had the procedure in the first place. And she didn\u2019t want to worry anyone about her own health issues, especially since Dr. Rubio assured her that fibroids were common and, at least at this point, not serious.</p><p>The Emersons bore one another\u2019s health burdens, sharing only some of the information with Rebecca. But Julia seemed to bear the burden of her graduate career alone.</p><p>(Or so she thought.)</p><p>Late one November evening, Gabriel awoke with a start. He was instantly alert, straining his ears for the slightest sound. In the distance, he heard a woman crying.</p><p>He reached for Julia in the darkness, but she was gone.</p><p>Without even bothering to switch on the light or to grab his bathrobe, he sprang to his feet, naked, and exited the bedroom.</p><p>A shaft of light shone from underneath the study door.</p><p>He quickly walked toward it, the sound of crying growing louder.</p><p>Behind the door, he found Julia, her head on her desk. Her shoulders were shaking, her glasses discarded on her open laptop. A large pile of books was scattered across the desk and down on the floor.</p><p>\u201cDarling.\u201d He placed his hand on her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do what?\u201d He crouched beside her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t catch up. I\u2019m behind in my reading for all my classes. I should be working on my seminar papers, but I\u2019ve been trying to read. I should have started the revisions on my lecture, but I haven\u2019t had time. And I\u2019m just so tired.\u201d Her voice cracked.</p><p>Gabriel eyed her sympathetically. \u201cCome to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d she wailed, throwing her hands up. \u201cI need to stay up all night and finish my reading. Then tomorrow, I need to spend the day in the library working on my papers. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to revise my lecture for publication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything more tonight. Even if you stayed up, you\u2019re too tired to focus. Come to bed now and you can get up early. You can tell me about your readings over breakfast and I\u2019ll see if I can give you the CliffsNotes version of them.\u201d He gestured to her with his hand.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cCliffsNotes won\u2019t cut it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulianne, it\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the morning. Come to bed.\u201d His tone grew commanding.</p><p>\u201cI have to stay up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep now and I\u2019ll help you. I can go with you to the library and help you with your research. That should save you some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d She wiped her nose with a tissue.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ve been volunteering to help you all semester. You wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re busy with your own stuff. And then you had surgery.\u201d She wiped her eyes hastily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get sick if you don\u2019t take care of yourself. Come on.\u201d He placed a hand on her elbow and helped her to her feet before closing her laptop firmly.</p><p>He followed her down the hall to their bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d she sniffled, resting her head on the pillow. She was even too tired to spoon.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is ask. I\u2019d do anything for you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to do this by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d He placed an arm around her waist. \u201cThe program is designed to be grueling. Everyone else is probably getting help from someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need help when you did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about what you\u2019re saying. I was doing coke when I was in grad school. And I had P\u2014someone to look after me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, lowering his voice. \u201cYou looked after me when I came home from the hospital. That\u2019s probably when you fell behind. Let me help you catch up. But the first thing you need is a good night\u2019s sleep. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She was too weary to argue. Within minutes, her breathing deepened and Gabriel knew that she\u2019d fallen asleep.</p><p>Chapter Fifty-five</p><p>That Saturday, Julia and Gabriel planned to spend most of the day in the library, researching her seminar papers. As a way of showing her appreciation, she prepared pancakes while he sat at the kitchen table, clad in his pajama pants and glasses, reading The Boston Globe.</p><p>She poured the batter onto a hot griddle before turning to him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me what you wrote in the card that you left at my apartment, back in Toronto?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his newspaper.</p><p>\u201cWhat card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one that didn\u2019t survive my loss of temper.\u201d</p><p>He pretended to search his memory.</p><p>\u201cOh, that card.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYes, that card.\u201d</p><p>He folded the newspaper and put it aside. \u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you tore it up.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look.</p><p>\u201cI thought you forgave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He smiled ruefully. \u201cIt was a simple card. I apologized for being an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was nice,\u201d she prompted. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you my Beatrice and said that I\u2019d wished for you my whole life, even though I was convinced that you were a hallucination. I said that now that I\u2019d found you, I\u2019d fight to make you mine.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled to herself as she flipped the pancakes.</p><p>\u201cAnd there might have been poetry.\u201d</p><p>She looked over at him. \u201cMight have been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShakespeare\u2019s twenty-ninth sonnet. Do you know it?</p><p>\u201c\u2018When in disgrace with fortune and men\u2019s eyes</p><p>I all alone beweep my outcast state,</p><p>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,</p><p>And look upon myself, and curse my fate,</p><p>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</p><p>Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,</p><p>Desiring this man\u2019s art, and that man\u2019s scope,</p><p>With what I most enjoy contented least;</p><p>Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,</p><p>Haply I think on thee, and then my state,</p><p>Like to the lark at break of day arising</p><p>From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven\u2019s gate;</p><p>For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings</p><p>That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Julia pressed her hand over her heart. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful, Gabriel. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s even more beautiful is the fact that I don\u2019t have to content myself with memories anymore. I have you.\u201d</p><p>Julia quickly turned off the burner and moved the griddle from the heat.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Gabriel appeared puzzled.</p><p>She tossed the spatula aside.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having ripped-up-note-revealed sex. I\u2019ve been waiting for this forever.\u201d She grabbed his hand, tugging him toward the hall. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He planted his feet. \u201cWhat kind of sex is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out.\u201d She gave him a saucy look and raced toward the stairs, the Professor at her heels.</p><p>Having spent a very long day conducting research, Gabriel and Julia returned to a dark house. Julia ordered pizza for dinner while Gabriel flipped through the Saturday mail.</p><p>He came across a blue envelope that was addressed to him in a spiky, unfamiliar hand. The return address was in New York City.</p><p>Intrigued, he opened the envelope and read,</p><p>Dear Gabriel (if I may),</p><p>Recently, I was contacted by Michael Wasserstein, our family attorney, telling me that you were making inquiries about our father, Owen Davies. I was told that you wanted to learn more about his family history.</p><p>My name is Kelly Davies Schultz and I\u2019m your half-sister. We also have a younger sister, Audrey.</p><p>I always wanted a brother. I mention this because I feel badly about how my mother and sister behaved with respect to our father\u2019s will and I want you to know that I was not a party to contesting it. At the time, I wanted to write to you to tell you so, but my mother was being difficult and I decided not to antagonize her. I made the wrong decision. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since my mother died this past spring, I\u2019ve been thinking about you and wondering if I should get in touch.

Please don\u2019t hesitate to call or to write.</p><p>Your sister,</p><p>Kelly</p><p>Gabriel lowered himself into a chair and sat, staring at the pages.</p><p>Chapter Fifty-six</p> <p>After dinner, Julia reread the letter from Kelly Davies Schultz.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She folded it neatly and handed it back to Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m skeptical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds nice. And funny, too. Why are you skeptical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey tried to have me disinherited. How do I know this isn\u2019t a ploy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ploy for what? The money was distributed years ago.\u201d</p> <p>He folded his arms across his chest. \u201cInformation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, she\u2019s the one with information. You wanted the opportunity to find out more about your family history, especially your parents\u2019 health. Now you have it. I thought you\u2019d be happy.\u201d She sat on the chair next to him. \u201cWhen would we go?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression tightened.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner I put all of this behind me, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be in Selinsgrove for Christmas and New Year\u2019s. I\u2019ll want to go earlier if Diane has the baby.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked at her closely.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot going on right now. I\u2019ve tried to help you catch up, and I promise I\u2019ll do more.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave him a half-smile. \u201cI feel as if there\u2019s a \u2018but\u2019 coming up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould it hurt you if I said this was something I wanted to do right away? Maybe after classes are finished the second week in December? I can have a graduate student deal with the exams.\u201d</p><p>Julia scratched at the surface of the kitchen table with her fingernail.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I have to submit my lecture for publication. I\u2019ll be finishing up my seminar papers and turning them in. That\u2019s the worst time for me to go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking this might be something I should do on my own.\u201d</p><p>Julia examined her fingernails as if they were fascinating.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re going to find out. I think you\u2019ll need me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled slowly.</p><p>\u201cI will always need you, Julianne. But I think the first time I meet Kelly it should be the two of us. Then if there\u2019s anything unpleasant, I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want. Can\u2019t we visit her over Christmas or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to put this off. She might change her mind. Certainly, the sooner I know about my medical history, the better.\u201d He gazed at her significantly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask you to do anything that would put your program in jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She did not sound enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cWe can ask Rebecca to stay while I\u2019m gone. Then you won\u2019t be alone. It will be a short trip. Two or three days, tops. I\u2019ll see if I can schedule an appointment with the lawyer who handled my father\u2019s estate and I\u2019ll meet Kelly. Then I\u2019ll come home.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand, tracing her lifeline with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bring myself to call her my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said that you don\u2019t have time. You need to get some work done. And I know that I\u2019m distracting.\u201d He gave her what he hoped might be a provocative look.</p><p>\u201cYou can be very distracting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He lifted her into his arms and walked toward the stairs. \u201cPrepare for some extensive distracting.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on his biceps, stilling him.</p><p>\u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put you down when we get to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something to say that you aren\u2019t going to want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen say it quickly and get it over with.\u201d He tensed.</p><p>She wriggled in his arms, so he set her down on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYour trip to New York is going to open up a lot of memories. Of course I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help. But one thing we haven\u2019t talked about is forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive my parents?\u201d he spat. \u201cThat\u2019s a laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgiveness frees you. It\u2019s for you, as much as for them.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away from her. \u201cI can\u2019t forgive them. They don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho deserves forgiveness, Gabriel? You? Me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApart from God, the only person who can forgive me is the one I\u2019ve wronged. That\u2019s the power we have. We can use that power for good\u2014to forgive someone. Or we can use it to hold on to old wrongs and hurts so that they never heal.\u201d</p><p>She reached out to him, grasping his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying they deserve it. I\u2019m certainly not asking you to forget or to pretend nothing ever happened. Just think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already thought about it. The answer is no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you ask Paulina to forgive you if you aren\u2019t willing to forgive your parents?\u201d</p><p>Air escaped Gabriel\u2019s lungs as if she\u2019d struck him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cJust think about it, my love. Think about your reconciliation with Maia and what that meant to you. And imagine what it would mean to your father to hear that you forgive him.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel led her upstairs but did not speak.</p><p>Chapter Fifty-seven</p><p>While Julia finished her seminar papers and revised her lecture for publication, Gabriel met with his urologist for a checkup on December fifth, then flew to New York.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019d checked into his room at the Ritz-Carlton, he realized his mistake. He should have brought Julia with him. The large and beautiful bed would be cold that evening. He hated sleeping alone. It always reminded him of their separation, a memory he loathed.</p><p>He placed a few phone calls\u2014to Lucia Barini at Columbia, to his father\u2019s lawyer, and to Julia. He was disappointed when his call went to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cJulianne, I\u2019m in New York. I\u2019m staying at the Ritz-Carlton, room four eleven. I\u2019m having dinner with Kelly tonight, and then I\u2019ll be in my room. Talk to you later. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel ended the call with a huff of frustration. Then he prepared to meet his sister.</p><p>Upon arriving at the Tribeca Grill, he was ushered to a table for two, at which sat an older, blond woman. When she looked up at him, he saw a pair of blue eyes that matched his own.</p><p>She fanned a hand to her mouth before standing. \u201cI\u2019m Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel Emerson.\u201d He shook her hand awkwardly.</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cYou look just like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>Without thinking, Gabriel pulled his hand back.</p><p>Kelly managed a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please.\u201d She gestured to the empty seat across from hers.</p><p>She sat down and dabbed at her eyes with a napkin.</p><p>\u201cIt was just such a shock, seeing you there. You look just like Dad did when he was young. How old are you, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember being thirty-five. I won\u2019t play coy and make you guess my age. I\u2019m forty-nine.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded, his jaw clenching and unclenching. He tried to formulate something to say but found himself at a loss. Mercifully, they were interrupted by the waiter.</p><p>They ordered drinks and made small talk until the waiter returned. Then they placed their dinner orders, waiting almost impatiently for the waiter to leave again.</p><p>Kelly leaned forward in her chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased to meet you. Thank you for accepting my invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Gabriel tried to force a smile.</p><p>\u201cI owe you an apology.\u201d</p><p>His smile disappeared. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said in my letter, I should have reached out to you when I learned of your existence. I should have done the right thing rather than worrying about upsetting my mother.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s hands drifted to his silverware. \u201cThat was a long time ago. We don\u2019t need to speak of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I should mention that my mother knew about you but would never discuss you, even after Dad died. She never forgave him for having a mistress.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s body visibly tightened.</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t know about me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I knew your mother. I\u2019m sorry to hear that she passed away.\u201d Kelly offered a sympathetic look.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Gabriel straightened in his chair. \u201cShe died when I was nine. But the family who adopted me are very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael mentioned that. He told me that our father had kept apprised of you and your doings for years.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We left New York just before my mother died. I didn\u2019t have contact with your father after that.\u201d Gabriel ground his teeth. \u201cNot a phone call, not a letter, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I assumed there was some contact between you and Dad, based on what Michael said.\u201d Kelly sipped her wine thoughtfully. \u201cHe told me that Dad was aware of the family who adopted you, and that he knew you went to Princeton and Harvard. Apparently, you were a topic of conversation between them over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was interested enough to discuss my life with his lawyer, why wasn\u2019t he interested enough to pick up the telephone? Or to write a letter?\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked down at the tablecloth. \u201cI think I can shed some light on that. Dad was the kind of man who made a decision and stuck to it.\u201d She lifted her face, surveying Gabriel\u2019s body language with concern. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried this conversation is upsetting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for answers,\u201d he clipped. \u201cI knew they weren\u2019t going to be pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. So you knew Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met him, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you grew up in Pennsylvania, after you left New York?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cI was fortunate that when my mother died, a family connected with the hospital agreed to take me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother\u2019s family?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grimaced and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry. But it\u2019s something I wondered. I met your mother a few times, and she seemed to be close to her parents. So I wondered why you didn\u2019t go and live with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather died before I was born. My grandmother became estranged with my mother over the circumstances surrounding my conception. When my mother died, my grandmother told social services they couldn\u2019t take me. My adoptive mother contacted my father, but he disowned me. I would have ended up in foster care were it not for the Clarks.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s expression was shuttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Kelly leaned forward in her chair. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had it easy, have you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou knew my mother?\u201d He swiftly changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cShe was one of the secretaries in my father\u2019s office. She was young and pretty, and whenever I went to visit my dad, she was always kind to me. I liked her very much. Around the time you were born or maybe shortly thereafter, my parents had a series of fights. And then everything calmed down. But a few years later, my mother left my father and moved in with my grandparents on Long Island. Six months later, my parents reconciled and she moved back to Manhattan. I\u2019m speculating, of course, but I\u2019m guessing the separation had something to do with you. One of the things I overheard my mother yelling about was \u2018that child.\u2019 Of course, Audrey and I had no idea who she was talking about. We assumed they were fighting over one of us.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pressed his lips together. \u201cHow old were you when they separated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, let me see.\u201d Kelly looked up at the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019d say twenty-three? Thereabouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have been nine. That was when we left New York.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mother probably gave Dad an ultimatum and that\u2019s why your mother decided to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever speak to your mother about any of this?\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s eyes widened in horror. \u201cAbsolutely not. My parents fought, but they never told us what their fights were about. I wouldn\u2019t have had the nerve to ask Mother about it, even as an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me anything else about my mother?\u201d</p><p>Kelly regarded their place settings thoughtfully. \u201cShe was beautiful and very sweet. She was young and full of life. My mother was a bit of a social climber and she could be very difficult. I don\u2019t know if you realize this, but the age difference between your parents would have been considerable. Dad was born in 1936. Your mother must have been twenty years younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered that. What can you tell me about him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI loved Dad, but he worked a lot. I have happy memories of going for walks with him in the city and having pancakes with him on Saturday morning. He was a pretty good father, even if he wasn\u2019t a very good husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your mother loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Kelly sounded offended. \u201cHe was handsome and charming. He had a great sense of humor and he was very accomplished. He just happened to be a philanderer. As surprising as it may sound, he adored my mother.\u201d At this, Kelly\u2019s eyes watered. She was quiet for a moment as she fought to control her emotions.</p><p>\u201cI see this is upsetting for you, too. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s tone was gentle.</p><p>Kelly waved a Kleenex in the air before drying her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was a shock when we found out he\u2019d had a mistress and that we had a brother. Audrey hasn\u2019t quite gotten over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>Kelly put on a brave face.</p> <p>\u201cI try to practice what I tell my patients and their parents. You can\u2019t control all of life\u2019s circumstances, but you can control your reactions to them. I could stay angry at my father for cheating on my mother. And I could be angry with my mother for being so hard-hearted that she kept me apart from my only brother. Or I could choose to forgive them, and myself, and try to make things better.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fell to her hands, which were resting in her lap. \u201cI always wanted a brother. I just didn\u2019t expect him to be so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry my mother and your father were . . . involved.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s expression softened in sympathy.</p><p>Her eyes met his. \u201cThank you, Gabriel. Don\u2019t the strangest sort of miracles come out of the worst of circumstances? Here we sit, after all these years. Knowing Dad, as I did, I\u2019m sure he must have cared for your mother. And you. He wouldn\u2019t have watched you from afar or included you in his estate if he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Gabriel pushed his meal aside.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine him fighting with my mother over something he didn\u2019t care about. And it was no secret in our family that he always wanted a son. But my mother didn\u2019t want another child.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s head bent so she could stare at her dinner plate. She\u2019d barely touched her food.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d had more time with him. I know that in wishing that, Audrey and I would have had less time.\u201d She gave Gabriel a sad smile. \u201cBut I would have shared him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Audrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey.\u201d Kelly sighed. \u201cAudrey sided with my mother. She sees you as a gold digger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want the money.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s tone was harsh. \u201cI only accepted it because I found myself and my adoptive family in dire circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Kelly reached out to him across the table, placing her hand over his.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t begrudge you a penny.\u201d She patted his hand before withdrawing. \u201cDad made a series of choices that had consequences for all of us. But he\u2019s dead. Our mothers are dead. It\u2019s time to forgive and move on. Certainly, Gabriel, you did nothing to hurt us. You could have sued the estate for more. You could have appeared at the reading of the will and embarrassed my mother. You could have called a press conference or spoken to a tabloid. But you didn\u2019t. Your actions show that you are a man of character, and that was another reason why I wanted to meet you. I think God brought us together.\u201d She gazed at her brother cautiously.</p><p>He blinked a little. \u201cMy wife tends to think like that. She sees Providence in everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would agree with her.\u201d Kelly finished her wine. \u201cDo you mind if I ask what prompted you to write to Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was Providence. Although perhaps it was.\u201d Gabriel toyed with his water glass. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my curiosity was practical more than anything else. Eventually my wife and I would like to have a family. I wanted to know more about my parents\u2019 medical history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a problem easily solved. Dad died of a heart attack. He didn\u2019t exercise, he was a workaholic, and he ate whatever he wanted. I\u2019m not sure he was born with a tendency for high cholesterol, although it\u2019s possible. Certainly, Audrey and I don\u2019t have that problem. As for his parents, as far as I know, they died in old age of natural causes. Did you know about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Not even their names.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s expression saddened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. We\u2019re very proud of our grandparents. Grandfather was a professor, like you. He taught Romantic literature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenjamin Spiegel.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sat bolt upright. \u201cBenjamin Spiegel? Professor Benjamin Spiegel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You know of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. He was the leading American expert in German Romanticism. We read his work in graduate school.\u201d Gabriel rubbed at his chin. \u201cHe was my grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was . . .\u201d A look of realization came over Gabriel\u2019s face.</p><p>Kelly tilted her head, watching him closely. \u201cJewish, yes.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked confused. \u201cI had no idea our father was Jewish. It was never mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for your mother, of course, but there\u2019s a long story behind Dad\u2019s silence. He had a youthful falling out with his father and changed his last name to Davies, leaving his family and heritage behind. By the time he met and married my mother, in 1961, he presented himself as an agnostic. So Judaism wasn\u2019t part of our household.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sat very still, his mind working.</p><p>\u201cBenjamin Spiegel,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI admire his writing very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a good man. He was a rabbi, you know, before he left Germany in the twenties. He was also a much-beloved professor at Columbia. There\u2019s a building named for him, as well as a number of scholarships. When he died, our grandmother, Miriam, founded a charitable organization in his name here in New York. I\u2019m on the board, along with several of our cousins. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d welcome your involvement, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the organization do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe promote literacy and reading in the New York public school system and donate books and supplies to classrooms. We also fund a lecture series at Columbia and at his former temple. Jonathan and I always attend.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWe like to say that we\u2019re part of the Presbyterian wing of Reform Judaism.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel returned her smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was German. Or Jewish. My mother\u2019s family was English, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany people would be surprised at what they find in their family tree if they look back a generation or two. Which is why all this hatred between races and religions is so foolish. We\u2019re all family, in one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>Kelly smiled. \u201cSince you\u2019re a professor of literature, I think it would be fitting for you to deliver the lectures at Columbia one year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you to say, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a Dante specialist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandfather was interested in everything, judging from the books in his library. I\u2019m sure Dante was there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wiped his lips with his napkin. \u201cWon\u2019t it be an embarrassment to the family?\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s sapphire eyes grew momentarily fierce, rather like that of a lioness.</p><p>\u201cYou are family. And if anyone dares to object, well . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as if she were contemplating something particularly nasty. \u201cApart from Audrey, I think you\u2019ll find everyone to be civil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, please tell the committee it would be an honor.\u201d He bowed his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll mention you to the cousins.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pushed her plate of food away and signaled to the waiter to remove it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve barely eaten.\u201d She looked with some distress at his full plate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d He indicated that the waiter take his meal, as well. Then he ordered coffee.</p><p>\u201cHave I upset you?\u201d Kelly\u2019s voice was low.</p><p>Gabriel paused.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just a lot to process.\u201d His expression shifted and his eyes grew alight. \u201cThe revelation that Professor Spiegel is my grandfather is a welcome surprise.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth widened into a smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to introduce you to Aunt Sarah, Dad\u2019s youngest sister. She can tell you all about her parents and your aunts and uncles. She\u2019s a wonderful lady. Very bright.\u201d Kelly regarded him for a moment. \u201cDid your mother ever explain why she called you Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My middle name is Owen, after our father.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s blue eyes sparkled. \u201cHis birth name was Othniel. Be grateful he rid himself of it before you were born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes my name have any significance to you?\u201d Gabriel waited with anticipation for her answer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Except that when Audrey was a teenager and my parents bought her a dog for her birthday, she wanted to call him Gabriel. Dad threw a fit and said no.\u201d Kelly looked off into space. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten about that until this very minute. My parents had a fight about that, too.\u201d She made eye contact with Gabriel again. \u201cIn the end, she called the dog Godfrey, which was a very silly name for a Pomeranian. But Pomeranians are a silly breed, I think. Jonathan and I always had Labradors.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was silent, not knowing what to say.</p><p>After a moment, he spoke.</p><p>\u201cHis name isn\u2019t on my birth certificate. And I wasn\u2019t granted his surname, obviously.\u201d</p><p>Kelly appeared uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I already knew that. When my mother and sister decided to contest the will, that was one of the pieces of evidence they cited. But Dad had signed an affidavit before he died, affirming that he was your father and stating that he persuaded your mother not to name him on your birth certificate. I don\u2019t know what kinds of promises Dad gave to your mother. But he must have felt guilty over what he did. Eventually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHumph,\u201d said Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I think he must have felt something more than guilt.\u201d She picked up her large handbag and went through it. \u201cHere.\u201d She placed an old photograph on the table, next to Gabriel\u2019s empty coffee cup.</p><p>The picture was of him and his mother. He looked to be about five years old.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember this picture. Where did you find it?\u201d He peered at it closely.</p><p>\u201cDad kept a box of things on his dresser. When my mother died, it came to me. I was looking at it the other night and I noticed there was a place where the fabric on the inside of the box had been ripped. Inside the hole, I found the picture. He must have been hiding it from my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with this.\u201d Gabriel gestured to the picture.</p> <p>\u201cKeep it, of course. I have some other things for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you read German?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She laughed, the sound soft and musical. \u201cI understand a little German because Dad used to speak it now and then, but I don\u2019t read it. So Grandfather\u2019s books are of no use to me. And I won\u2019t wear Dad\u2019s cuff links. So you see, you\u2019d be doing me a favor by taking them off my hands. In fact, given the size of our apartment and the amount of things in it, it would be a mitzvah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mitzvah,\u201d he mumbled, as the waiter served their coffee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been very rude, Gabriel, doing most of the talking and not asking about yourself or your wife. I hope I\u2019ll be able to meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Gabriel finally cracked a smile. \u201cHer name is Julianne. She\u2019s a graduate student at Harvard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has a lovely name. How long have you been married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, newlyweds. Do you have a picture?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wiped his hands with his napkin before pulling out his iPhone. He quickly scrolled to a recent photograph of Julia sitting behind his desk at their house in Cambridge. Unthinkingly, he stroked the curve of her cheek with his thumb as he gazed at the photo.</p><p>He handed the phone to his sister.</p><p>\u201cYou must love her very much.\u201d Kelly had been watching him intently.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks young.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel barely suppressed a frown. \u201cShe\u2019s younger than me, yes.\u201d</p><p>Kelly chuckled. \u201cAt my age, everyone looks young.\u201d</p><p>She was about to return the phone when she stopped. She peered closely at the photo. Then she tapped at the screen to enlarge it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that on your desk?\u201d She held the phone out to Gabriel, pointing to a small, black object.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a train engine. I\u2019ve had it since I was a boy. Julia thought it would make a fine paperweight.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stared at the photo again.</p><p>Gabriel frowned. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamiliar?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to look at him.</p><p>\u201cDad had one, from when he was a child. He kept the engine, one car, and a caboose on his dresser. Then one day, the engine disappeared. When Audrey asked him about it he said that it got broken. We thought at the time it was a feeble excuse. The engine was made of iron. Where did you say you got it from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. I\u2019ve always had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe train was his favorite toy when he was a child. I think his initials were scratched into the bottom of the engine.\u201d She gave Gabriel a significant look. \u201cWhen you get home, you should check. I\u2019d be interested in knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it make a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the one I\u2019m thinking of, then he must have given it to you. Since it meant so much to him, I think you must have meant a lot to him, too.\u201d She returned his phone to him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>She toyed with her coffee cup, swirling her spoon in the brown liquid before placing it on the saucer. \u201cBut you see, I knew him. I knew him for years. He was a complicated man, a driven man, but he wasn\u2019t cruel. He found himself caught between your mother and you, and my mother and us. I\u2019m not saying he made the right choice. If he\u2019d been stronger or my mother had been more forgiving, he could have had all his children living in the same city. The whole thing reminds me a little of the story of Hagar and Ishmael from the Bible. I can\u2019t help but suspect my mother played the part of Sarah. Even though her name was Nancy. I want to believe that he loved you. That he cared about you and that\u2019s why he kept tabs on you and included you in his will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s tone was cold.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s possible, brother. He wasn\u2019t a monster. And, \u2018There are more things in Heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHamlet,\u201d said Gabriel, begrudgingly.</p><p>\u201cI like to think our grandfather would be proud of both of us. You went to Harvard. I went to Vassar.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIs your wife\u2014is Julianne religious?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tucked the photograph Kelly had given him in the inner pocket of his suit jacket.</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s Catholic and her faith means something to her. Certainly, she tries to live it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI converted to Catholicism prior to our marriage. I believe, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a Catholic on the foundation\u2019s board. You\u2019ll be the first.\u201d Kelly signaled to the waiter to bring the check. \u201cWait till the cousins learn that there\u2019s now a Catholic wing of Reform Judaism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d Gabriel huffed into his cell phone, as he connected with Julia\u2019s voice mail. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come without you.</p><p>\u201cJulianne, I wish you wouldn\u2019t switch off your phone. It\u2019s the best way for me to get hold of you. It\u2019s after midnight and I\u2019ve just gotten into my hotel room after having dinner with Kelly.</p><p>\u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t call you earlier. Our conversation went longer than expected. She\u2019s very nice. You were right, as usual. Funny how you\u2019re almost always right. [exhaling slowly]</p><p>\u201cThe portrait Kelly painted of our father is very different from the one I remember. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that the man she adored hit my mother. [sigh]</p><p>\u201cI wish you were here. By the end of dinner I was beginning to doubt my memories. To doubt myself.</p><p>\u201cI need you to do something for me. Can you look at the train engine on my desk and see if there is anything scratched into the bottom of it? It\u2019s important.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to extend my visit. There\u2019s an aunt Kelly wants to introduce me to on Friday. This means I won\u2019t be leaving until Saturday. I\u2019m sorry about that but I think it\u2019s best to tie up all the loose ends before I come home.</p><p>Call me when you get this message, no matter what time it is.\u201d [another pause] \u201cApparuit iam beatitudo vestra. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tossed his cell phone on the large, empty bed.</p><p>He was still processing his conversation with his sister. Much of what she\u2019d said surprised him. It was clear that her relationship with her father was loving and good. In this respect, as in others, it appeared that he and Kelly had two very different fathers.</p><p>It had been a relief to have some of his questions answered, even if the answers led to more questions. Certainly, the news about his grandfather was good. A warm feeling spread in his chest at the thought.</p><p>At least I have one blood relative I can be proud of, in addition to my sister.</p><p>How he wished he could have come home to a sleeping Julianne and tell her what had happened. How he wished he could crawl into her arms and erase the day. He\u2019d made a colossal error when he determined to do things alone. And now, as usual, he was forced to live with the consequences.</p><p>Cursing himself, he strode to the shower, hoping that the hot water would clear his head. Then he was going to finish reading his mother\u2019s diary, to see if he could discover the truth about his parents\u2019 relationship.</p><p>Chapter Fifty-eight</p><p>December 5, 2011</p><p>Washington, D.C.</p><p>Natalie Lundy stared at the photograph in shock.</p><p>She heard a strange buzzing sound as her world suddenly came to a halt. She looked at the black-and-white picture\u2014at the man and the young blond woman holding one another and smiling for the camera. At the large diamond solitaire glittering on the woman\u2019s finger. At the announcement of the union of two powerful political families.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s stomach rebelled. She heaved over the wastepaper basket, emptying herself of that morning\u2019s breakfast. Shakily, she wiped her mouth and stumbled to the bathroom.</p><p>She drank a cup of water as her mind worked. She\u2019d just lost everything. She\u2019d heard the rumors, of course. But she also knew that Simon was only with Senator Hudson\u2019s daughter for political reasons. Or so he\u2019d said the last time he\u2019d been in her bed, at the end of August.</p><p>She\u2019d done what he told her to do. She\u2019d worked for his father and kept her mouth shut. She\u2019d emailed or called Simon on occasion, but his responses had become fewer and fewer until they ceased altogether, sometime in November.</p><p>He\u2019d been playing her. He\u2019d been playing her for years. Always panting after someone else while satisfying himself with her body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she\u2019d done things for him. Things she hadn\u2019t wanted to do, such as various sexual acts and pretending not to care while he fucked other women.</p><p>She stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror as a terrible idea took hold.</p><p>She had nothing to lose, but everything to gain. He had everything to lose and God damn it, she\u2019d see that he lost it.</p><p>She put the water glass aside and wiped her mouth, darting into the bedroom on surer feet. She crouched on the floor and pried aside one of the floorboards underneath her bed. She withdrew a flash drive and carefully put it in her jacket pocket. Then she replaced the floorboard.</p> <p>Grabbing her coat and purse, she headed to the door. As she hailed a taxi, she didn\u2019t notice the dark car parked across the street. So she didn\u2019t realize that it pulled into traffic behind the cab, following at a safe distance.</p><p>Chapter Fifty-nine</p><p>Gabriel, are you getting my messages? This is the third time I\u2019ve called and gotten your voice mail.</p><p>\u201cI left you a message this morning about the train engine. There are letters scratched into the bottom of it and they say \u2018O.S.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what that means, do you? And how did you know to look for them? I never noticed them before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to extend your trip but I understand. I hope that your meeting with your aunt goes well.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m at the library working on my last seminar paper. You know we\u2019re not allowed to talk on the phone here. Text me and I\u2019ll step outside and call you back. I love you. And I miss you.\u201d</p><p>Julia groaned as she ended the call. Gabriel\u2019s messages had been melancholy and sad, and growing more so. Somehow, between all his errands and her attempts at completing and submitting her lecture for publication, they\u2019d missed one another. She worried about him.</p><p>At least if she could complete her final seminar paper, she\u2019d be finished for the semester. Then she and Gabriel could begin their Christmas holidays.</p><p>She began typing on her laptop in earnest.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of Giuseppe Pacciani of Florence?\u201d Lucia Barini, chair of the Department of Italian at Columbia University, gazed at Gabriel over her desk.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cNot much. He\u2019s published a few things in addition to his book, but nothing of consequence, in my opinion. Why do you ask?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re conducting a search to replace one of our retiring professors and he\u2019s on our long list.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lifted his eyebrows. \u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever, a graduate student has made serious allegations against him, dating all the way back to when she was his student in Florence. You know her\u2014Christa Peterson.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grimaced. \u201cYes, I know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the rumors about what happened in Toronto. I also heard that Christa started those rumors and that she\u2019s one of the reasons why you and Julianne are no longer there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulianne was admitted to Harvard. We were getting married. I was eager to leave Toronto.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s affect was decidedly flat.</p><p>Lucia gave him a friendly smile. \u201cOf course. I only realized what a problem Christa had been after Jeremy Martin persuaded me to take her. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have been inclined to admit her. We receive a lot of applications and can afford to be choosy.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel simply sat, immobile like a statue.</p> <p>Lucia removed her glasses. \u201cIt\u2019s come to my attention that Christa is a troublemaker and that she takes her troublemaking tendencies wherever she goes. She had trouble with Pacciani in Florence, she had trouble in Toronto, and apparently, she had trouble with Katherine Picton in Oxford this summer. Katherine telephoned to tell me to start teaching etiquette to our graduate students since it\u2019s obvious they don\u2019t know how to behave in public.\u201d Lucia\u2019s tone was absent any amusement. \u201cI don\u2019t like receiving calls like that from anyone, especially from her. This semester, my faculty informed me that no one wants to serve on Christa\u2019s examination committee. They\u2019re worried about being slandered for harassment.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s look was pointed. \u201cThey\u2019re right to be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my thought, as well. Now I\u2019m in the awkward position of either having to agree to supervise Christa myself, and offending Katherine, or having to tell her to go elsewhere.\u201d Lucia tossed her glasses on the desk in front of her. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel paused, knowing in that instant that Christa\u2019s academic career rested in his hands. He could explain, in detail, what really happened in Toronto and Oxford, and demonstrate the lengths to which Christa would go for a sexual conquest. Such information would no doubt make up Lucia\u2019s mind for her.</p><p>He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and then put them back again, acutely aware of the words Julia (and St. Francis) would whisper in his ear.</p><p>Exposing Christa would also expose himself and Julianne. She didn\u2019t want the rumors fed. And she deserved to be able to stand in a room filled with academics and be seen for herself, and not as part of a scandal.</p><p>Lucia was a friend, but not a close one. Gabriel didn\u2019t want to revisit every encounter he\u2019d ever had with Christa Peterson, embarrassing himself and his wife. For her sake, and the sake of her reputation, he decided to try a different tack.</p><p>\u201cIf we put the personal issues aside, I can tell you that Christa\u2019s work for me was mediocre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s been my impression. If you couple that with her behavior . . .\u201d Lucia shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s a liability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt Pacciani is blameless. I\u2019ve seen him in action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe represents another difficult situation.\u201d Lucia gestured to a file that was sitting open on her desk. \u201cChrista is making allegations about his past behavior, but there are reports that he beds his students and that\u2019s why he\u2019s eager to leave Florence. I don\u2019t want that in my department for obvious reasons, not least of which is because it invites lawsuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Gabriel, tapping his foot unconsciously.</p><p>Lucia placed her glasses in a case, which she then tucked into her purse. \u201cEnough of my troubles. Let me take you to lunch. I have reservations at Del Posto.\u201d</p><p>She pushed back from her desk. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do. Is it true that Julianne told Don Wodehouse that the question he asked wasn\u2019t germane to her thesis?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughed uproariously. \u201cNo, that isn\u2019t true. At least, not exactly.\u201d</p><p>He followed Lucia out of the office, proudly describing Julianne\u2019s presentation and the way she handled her questioners, including Professor Wodehouse of Magdalen College.</p><p>\u201cDamnation.\u201d Gabriel cursed his iPhone, which appeared to be dead.</p><p>As if he had the power of resurrection, he shook it, pressing the on button repeatedly. He\u2019d almost decided to fling the item into Central Park out of frustration when he remembered that he\u2019d neglected to charge it the evening before.</p><p>\u201cJulianne will be worried,\u201d he muttered, as he walked the streets of New York to Michael Wasserstein\u2019s office.</p><p>Mr. Wasserstein was retired, but since he\u2019d been Owen Davies\u2019s attorney from the time he penned a prenuptial agreement for him in 1961, he\u2019d agreed to meet Gabriel at his former law firm.</p><p>Gabriel looked at his watch. He had just enough time to make a quick call to Julianne from a pay phone before his meeting.</p><p>He located an obliging phone at Columbus Circle, swiped his credit card, and dialed her cell phone. After several rings, he received her voice mail, once again.</p><p>\u201cDamnation,\u201d he muttered (once again).</p><p>\u201cJulianne, for God\u2019s sake, answer your damn phone. I\u2019m going to have to buy you a pager. [loud exhale] I\u2019m sorry. That was rude. Would you please answer your phone? I\u2019m calling from a pay phone because I forgot to charge my phone last night and now it\u2019s dead. When I get back to my room I\u2019ll charge it. [brief pause] Now I\u2019m wondering if I brought the charger cord with me. I can\u2019t seem to remember a damn thing. See what happens when I\u2019m away from you? I\u2019m lucky I\u2019m not homeless and panhandling. I\u2019m on my way to see my father\u2019s attorney. Apparently, he has some things he wants to say in person. [longer pause] I wish you were here. I love you. Call me when you get this message.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel hung up the phone, then continued walking, his thoughts on his upcoming appointment.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s it going, Rach?\u201d Julianne asked her friend that evening, connected as they were by long distance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Rachel\u2019s normally cheerful demeanor was decidedly subdued.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Julianne could hear a door open and close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going into the bedroom so Aaron can\u2019t hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Rachel sounded exasperated.</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u2019</p><p>\u201cCan you get me pregnant? If so, I\u2019ll book you the next flight to Philadelphia. And I\u2019ll see that you\u2019re canonized for performing a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRach.\u201d Julia\u2019s tone was gently reproachful.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Rachel began to cry.</p><p>Julia\u2019s heart tore at the sound of her best friend\u2019s sobs. Rachel\u2019s tears were the soul-baring cries of a woman who desperately wished to become a mother.</p><p>\u201cRachel, sweetie. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Julia felt her own eyes water as she listened, not knowing what to say.</p><p>When Rachel\u2019s tears subsided, she spoke. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been to the doctor. The problem isn\u2019t Aaron. The problem is me. I\u2019m not ovulating. So I\u2019m going to have to start having hormone injections in the hope that they can jump-start my ovaries. Or else . . .\u201d</p><p>Rachel sniffled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Are the hormone injections a big deal?\u201d Julia\u2019s question was hesitant.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that. Damn it, I don\u2019t know why my body won\u2019t cooperate! The one time I want it to do something important, it fails me. I just don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Aaron say?\u201d</p><p>Rachel laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s what he doesn\u2019t say. He keeps telling me that it\u2019s all right, that everything will work out. I\u2019d rather he told me that he was pissed off and disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he not be? I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s upset because you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, so I can discuss how much of a failure I am? No thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRach, you aren\u2019t a failure. And it sounds like you have options. So don\u2019t give up hope.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come up for a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Work is really busy right now. But you\u2019re coming home for Christmas, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019ll be home next week, I think. Sooner if Diane goes into labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from them lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talk to them on the phone every Sunday, and Diane sends me email updates. So far everything is okay, but they\u2019re still worried about the stress of delivery on the baby. She\u2019s going to deliver at the Children\u2019s Hospital, which means they\u2019ll have to drive into Philadelphia when she goes into labor. Or get a hotel in the city around her due date.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen is she due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecember twenty-third.\u201d</p><p>Rachel was silent again.</p><p>Julia heard the sound of a door opening and then Aaron\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cJules, I\u2019m going to have to go.\u201d Rachel\u2019s voice was muffled. \u201cBut I\u2019ll call you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I love you, Rachel.

I\u2019m receiving his messages, but we haven\u2019t been able to speak since he left. I keep calling and calling and all I get is voice mail\u2014on his cell phone and in his hotel room.\u201d She placed her head in her hands. \u201cI found the charger cord to his phone upstairs. He\u2019s going to have to buy another one. Or call me from the hotel. But he seems to be out all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took most of the pay phones off the streets of New York. He\u2019ll have trouble finding one while he\u2019s out.\u201d Rebecca folded the dish towels and placed them in a drawer.</p><p>Julia drummed her fingers on the granite countertop while staring daggers at her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cI should have gone with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had papers to finish. I still have one left to do, but now I can\u2019t concentrate.\u201d She lifted her face to look at Rebecca. \u201cI\u2019m worried about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s all right. Although it isn\u2019t like him to forget something.\u201d Rebecca gestured toward the phone cord. \u201cHe\u2019s usually so\u2014fastidious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a polite word for it.\u201d</p><p>Julia glanced at the mail that Rebecca had stacked on the kitchen island and noticed an envelope addressed to Gabriel from JetBlue.</p><p>She stood up straight.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I could get a flight to New York tonight?\u201d Julia reached for her laptop.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be cheap, but you could try.\u201d Rebecca smiled gently. \u201cGabriel has only been gone two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems like forever,\u201d muttered Julia.</p> <p>Rebecca\u2019s face wore a knowing look. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re still newlyweds.\u201d</p><p>Julia pulled up the JetBlue website and began typing furiously.</p><p>\u201cThe prices are a fortune,\u201d she lamented, as she scrolled through several pages.</p><p>\u201cThink of it as an early Christmas gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t as if I spend a lot of money on things,\u201d she rationalized. \u201cGabriel is the one who insists on paying top dollar for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be glad you bought the ticket when he sees you.\u201d Rebecca glanced toward the stairs. \u201cI can pull out your suitcase and help you pack. If your flight is tonight, you\u2019ll probably have to leave right away. You don\u2019t want to be stuck in rush hour traffic on the way to the airport.\u201d</p><p>Julia lifted her arm and gave Rebecca a hug. \u201cThank you. He\u2019ll be so surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably in worse shape than you,\u201d Rebecca observed, as she headed toward the stairs.</p><p>Within two hours, Julia was at Logan Airport, waiting for the last flight to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. She left a message for Gabriel with the concierge at the Ritz-Carlton, telling him that she would be checking in later that evening, and she ordered sparkling water, strawberries, and truffles to be delivered to their room.</p><p>Rebecca had been in the middle of packing her carry-on when she\u2019d flown into the bedroom, telling her that the taxi was on its way. Julia was in such a hurry, she\u2019d quickly grabbed her makeup and toothbrush, leaving her other essentials behind.</p><p>She packed up her laptop and research (which were far more important than personal items, since she needed to finish her seminar paper), located her purse, and made it to the front door just in time to greet the arriving taxi.</p><p>Gabriel was going to be surprised.</p><p>The Professor ordered the cabbie to wait for him before exiting the taxi. They\u2019d parked down the street from the house he was interested in, so as not to attract attention.</p><p>He walked down the street slowly, noting the numbers on the houses. It was a residential neighborhood on Staten Island, populated by old, small homes.</p><p>Then he saw it.</p><p>The house itself was unremarkable\u2014small and white with a detached garage and a short, paved driveway. It was situated on a very small lot, with a tiny fringe of lawn that separated the front of the house from the sidewalk. A new-looking black Mercedes was parked at the curb.</p><p>Gabriel stood, two houses down, watching.</p><p>To his surprise, the front door opened and a man with gray hair exited. The man turned his body, coaxing an elderly woman. After she\u2019d closed and locked the door behind them, he took her arm and painstakingly escorted her down the front steps.</p><p>Gabriel approached.</p><p>The woman must have been hard of hearing because the man\u2019s voice was raised, but not in anger. Gabriel heard something about a doctor\u2019s appointment and Joey\u2019s birthday party.</p><p>The woman caught sight of Gabriel and stopped, staring over at him.</p><p>He slowed his pace, finally pausing on the sidewalk across the street.</p><p>This was his moment.</p><p>Now was his opportunity to speak to her, to demand answers to questions, to reveal himself.</p><p>The man she was with glanced in Gabriel\u2019s direction, then began tugging at the woman\u2019s arm, his voice still raised.</p><p>The woman turned away from Gabriel and obediently followed her escort to the Mercedes, where he opened the door and patiently waited while she situated herself.</p><p>The man seemed oblivious to the Professor\u2019s presence as he closed the car door and rounded the vehicle. He started the car and drove away.</p><p>Gabriel watched the Mercedes turn the corner and disappear out of sight.</p><p>Chapter Sixty</p><p>It was well after midnight when Gabriel entered his hotel room. He was world weary and tired, his hair disheveled, his tie askew.</p><p>Without bothering to switch on a light, he threw his winter coat over a chair and kicked off his boots.</p><p>(It should be mentioned that his boots were almost, but not quite, bad-assed, given that they were worn with a suit.)</p><p>Just as he was removing his tie, light streamed from the lamp on one of the nightstands.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s curse was interrupted by a feminine voice. \u201cSweetie?\u201d</p><p>His eyes focused on the sight of Julianne, naked in bed with tousled hair. Her dark eyes were soft and sleepy, her ruby lips parted, her voice deliciously husky.</p><p>She looked like a sex kitten.</p><p>\u201cUm, surprise.\u201d She waved.</p><p>With a cry, Gabriel ran toward her, crawling across the bed and placing his hands to her face so he could kiss her. He kissed her long and he kissed her well, their tongues touching until they were both breathless.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He pushed her hair lovingly back from her face.</p><p>\u201cDelivering the charger cord for your iPhone.\u201d She pointed to the forgotten item sitting on the nightstand.</p><p>His long fingers slid to the back of her neck, where they massaged her skin. His eyes gleamed.</p><p>\u201cYou flew to New York to give me my phone cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just your phone cord. I also brought the attachment that plugs into the wall. You know, in case you wanted to charge it through an outlet.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her nose. \u201cI really missed that cord. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you miss the attachment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I was very, very lonely for it.\u201d His lips curved into a half-smile.</p><p>\u201cI was worried about you. We kept missing each other on the telephone.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression shifted and his eyes looked tired. \u201cWe need a better form of communication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmoke signals, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point, I\u2019d accept passenger pigeons.\u201d</p><p>She gestured to the table that held the strawberries and chocolates, some of which had already been consumed. \u201cI ordered room service. I\u2019m afraid I started without you. I didn\u2019t expect you to be so late.\u201d</p><p>He moved so that his back was against the headboard and pulled her into his lap, tucking the sheet around her naked body so she wouldn\u2019t catch cold. \u201cIf I\u2019d known you were waiting, I\u2019d have come home hours ago. I was on Staten Island and then I went to Brooklyn to see our old apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything seemed smaller than I remember it\u2014the neighborhood, the building.\u201d He brought their foreheads together. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I regretted my decision to come on my own almost the moment I left the house.\u201d</p><p>She breathed deeply, inhaling his scent. She smelled Aramis and coffee and something that could have been soap. But she didn\u2019t smell smoke.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite the secret agent, Julianne. I had no idea you were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left a message for you with the concierge. When I arrived, he had one of the porters escort me.\u201d She gazed around the room. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful room.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cI would have booked a suite if I\u2019d known you were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is far nicer than I could have imagined. And it has a breathtaking view of Central Park.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around her. \u201cSo now that you\u2019re here, what am I going to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kiss me. Then you\u2019re going to take off your suit and show me just how much you missed your phone cord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the attachment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the attachment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you napped on the plane.\u201d Gabriel grinned before bringing his eager mouth to hers.</p><p>Chapter Sixty-one</p><p>Gabriel was still inside her, their bodies entwined. Julia was running her fingers lazily up and down his back as he held himself above her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my family.\u201d His thumb traced the curve of her cheek.</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes met his.</p><p>He continued, his voice a husky whisper. \u201cAll this searching, all this anxiety, when what I was looking for was right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling.\u201d She pressed her palm against his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I got lost in my head and shut you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, you needed to find out more about your family. It was part of your healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I needed was you.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a heartbreaking smile, as if he\u2019d handed her the world.</p><p>\u201cI need you, too, Gabriel. I was sad while you were gone, even though Rebecca stayed with me. The house was so empty. And sleeping alone sucks.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and her body reacted to his movements.</p><p>\u201cRemind me of this conversation the next time I\u2019m determined to go off on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man has to do what a man has to do. But he should bring his wife with him.\u201d She pushed his hair back from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never argue with a naked woman.\u201d</p><p>Her pretty features grew pensive.</p><p>He stroked her cheek again, his blue eyes darkening. \u201cHave I made you sad?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was just thinking about what Grace used to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat marriage is a mystery. That two people somehow become knitted together until they\u2019re one. When we\u2019re separated, I feel as if part of me is missing.\u201d She shifted slightly beneath him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you feel it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt it before we were married, but it\u2019s different now. The ache is more intense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor a long time, I didn\u2019t see how marriage could be something over and above love. But it is. I just can\u2019t explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can I. Perhaps that\u2019s why she called it a mystery.\u201d</p><p>He looked down the length of their bodies.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this. It\u2019s postcoital-cuddling-while-you\u2019re-still-inside-me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the technical description, yes. If we wait long enough, we\u2019ll be able to start up again.\u201d</p><p>Julia flexed her muscles around him, and he twitched in response.</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, Professor, your recovery time is minimal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God for that,\u201d he murmured, beginning to move inside her once again.</p><p>It must be said that in general, the Emersons slept better when they were together than they ever did apart. That evening was no exception.</p><p>(When they finally stopped making love long enough to sleep, that is.)</p> <p>The following morning, Gabriel awoke, noticing that Julianne was still slumbering, her face pressed against one of his pectorals. He studied her profile without moving, resisting the urge to lift her chin so he could kiss her.</p><p>Instead, he memorized the skin of her back and shoulders with his fingers.</p><p>A great burden had been lifted from him. He hadn\u2019t received exactly the answers he\u2019d wished, but he\u2019d received something better\u2014the gift of his sister and his grandfather. Professor Spiegel was erudite and noble, well known for his intellectual insight and charity. He was a man Gabriel desired to know better. He was an ancestor whose blood he would be glad to pass on to his children.</p><p>The thought comforted him.</p><p>Kelly had introduced a seed of suspicion that their father was not the monster he\u2019d thought. Gabriel\u2019s memories and dreams were mixed to such a degree that it was possible he\u2019d confused one with the other. Still, the facts he knew for certain about his father were damning enough.</p><p>What kind of man abandons the mother of his child and disowns his son?</p><p>His throat tightened as he thought of himself.</p><p>\u201cDid you see your grandmother?\u201d Julianne blinked up at him sleepily.</p> <p>\u201cOnly from a distance. She was walking from her house to a car, with someone who is probably an uncle. At least, I think she was my grandmother. She lives in the same house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t speak to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He moved his hand to the small of her back, spanning the twin dimples that were above the curve of her backside. It was one of his favorite parts of her body.</p><p>(Privately, he contemplated planting a flag there in an act of corporeal colonialism.)</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Julia was puzzled.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t my family. Standing there, I realized I might as well be an alien to them. There was no connection. Nothing.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAt least when I met my sister I recognized her eyes.\u201d</p><p>Julia gave him a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cShe and I have our father\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need to speak to your grandmother to find out about your mother\u2019s medical history?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarson was able to get the autopsy report for my mother. He was also able to get information about her medical history, through dubious means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeart disease and high blood pressure run in her family, but there wasn\u2019t anything especially worrisome.\u201d</p><p>Julia visibly relaxed under his fingers.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Gabriel sounded strangely underwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father\u2019s side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly told me there was some heart disease on their side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to meet your grandmother or your other relatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my mother\u2019s diary and a few anecdotes from Kelly. That\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly knew your mother?\u201d Julia sat up next to him.</p><p>\u201cShe remembers meeting her when she worked for our father. And she recalls her parents fighting, presumably over my mother and me. I\u2019d like to introduce you to Kelly. She and her husband have invited me to dinner tonight and then Friday night we\u2019re supposed to go and visit our Aunt Sarah in Queens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to meet your sister. But you might have to take me shopping for something to wear to dinner. Rebecca packed for me, so I have a carry-on full of lingerie and only one dress.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes grew heated. \u201cClearly, she doesn\u2019t know you very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, brushing her ear with his lips. \u201cBecause you sleep naked.\u201d</p><p>Julia thrilled to his nearness. She began playing with the few strands of his chest hair.</p><p>\u201cDid you finish your mother\u2019s diary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about what you\u2019d expect. As time wore on and she realized she would never have a life with my father, she grew more and more despondent, until finally, she stopped writing altogether.\u201d</p><p>Julia rested her hand over his tattoo, gently pressing into the skin.</p><p>\u201cAre you glad you came to New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Because of Kelly, I have some good news. Professor Benjamin Spiegel of Columbia was my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenjamin Spiegel,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize his name. Was he a Dante specialist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he specialized in Romanticism. We read some of his work in grad school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine Picton despises the Romantics. She accused me once of giving a Romantic reading of Dante.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel chuckled. \u201cNot everyone appreciates the Romantics. But Professor Spiegel did. His writings were the gold standard for decades. He published in German, mostly, but a few of his articles are in English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was your grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Gabriel wore a look of pride. \u201cKelly tells me he was much loved at Columbia and well known for his charity work and his leadership in the Jewish community.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you know about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and my father had a falling out. My father changed his name, turned his back on Judaism, and didn\u2019t speak of his family. Kelly knew, of course. She\u2019s in touch with our cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, he died before she was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we know where your passion for literature came from. And your interest in kosher sex.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMy interest in kosher sex is derived from other things, but maybe there\u2019s a connection.\u201d</p><p>His face grew serious. \u201cLearning about my grandfather was the saving grace of my visit.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s smile faded. \u201cWhat about your sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey won\u2019t have anything to do with me. Kelly is wonderful, but she views my father in a very different light.\u201d Gabriel grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the truth lies. Was he the loving dad she remembers or the man who hit my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that he didn\u2019t hit your mother or you, but it\u2019s possible his relationship with his wife and other children was very different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t comforting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel buried his face in her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he want us?\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s heart clenched.</p><p>\u201cI think he wanted you, along with his other family. That was the problem. He wanted to have it all and he couldn\u2019t. Any failure on his part is his, not yours.\u201d She kissed Gabriel forcefully. \u201cWill you tell me more about your sister? So much has happened and I\u2019ve only been hearing pieces of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, but can it wait? There\u2019s something kosher I\u2019d rather do instead.\u201d Gabriel rolled to his back, pulling her on top of him.</p><p>After room service had been delivered and eaten, Julianne returned to bed, covering herself with a sheet.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just stay here all day and have sex.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sat at her feet, his eyes sparkling. \u201cNow that\u2019s the Julianne I know and love. But don\u2019t you have a paper to finish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather finish you.\u201d She crooked a finger.</p><p>He was just about to pull the sheet from her naked body when his iPhone rang.</p><p>He glanced at it.</p><p>Then his eyes traveled to Julia\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Gabriel wore a sour expression. \u201cYour uncle Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he calling you?\u201d She sat up, tugging the sheet with her. \u201cDo you think something\u2019s wrong with my dad? Or the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d</p><p>He unplugged his phone and held it to his ear. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmerson. I\u2019m standing in a Fed Ex depot in Washington, D.C.\u201d As always, Jack came straight to the point.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding a flash drive that contains videos and photographs, some of which are of my niece. And they aren\u2019t exactly G-rated.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sat down on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou told me you got everything,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cThought I did. The girl must have had a backup hidden somewhere. She tried to send it to Andrew Sampson at The Washington Post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fix it. This is your problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow that. Just called to discuss the play.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes darted to Julia\u2019s.</p><p>What\u2019s going on? she mouthed.</p><p>He held up a single finger, indicating that she should wait.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl is angry with her boyfriend because he dumped her to marry someone else. She wants to embarrass him and his father. I say we help her. I\u2019ll copy everything having to do with the girl and her boyfriend to a new flash drive and send it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that risky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt implicates them and keeps my niece out of it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked at Julianne\u2014at the way her eyebrows were knitted together, a wrinkle forming in between them.</p><p>\u201cYour niece is here. Let me speak to her about it and I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making this decision for her.\u201d Gabriel disconnected the call, tossing the phone on the bed.</p><p>He scrubbed his face with his hands.</p><p>Julia moved closer. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is Jack calling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently Natalie had a flash drive of photos and videos hidden somewhere. She tried to Fed Ex it to The Washington Post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Julia screeched. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be on the Internet. It\u2019s going to be in the newspapers. Oh my God. Oh my God.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She buried her face in her hands and began rocking back and forth.</p><p>Gabriel reached out to touch her shoulder. \u201cNot so fast.

Ask him to find all the copies and destroy them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? He can delete the photos involving you and send the rest. They\u2019d get what they deserve.\u201d</p> <p>Julia pulled the sheet up to her chin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want revenge.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes glinted dangerously. \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve moved on. I rarely think of them and I want to keep it that way. I don\u2019t want to watch their lives implode and know that I\u2019m responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be responsible. They\u2019re the ones responsible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m accountable for my actions.\u201d Julianne\u2019s voice grew steely. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Natalie is doing this now, after you and Jack sorted her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon is marrying someone else.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes grew round. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect Natalie is hoping his fianc\u00e9e will leave him if his past is exposed.\u201d</p><p>Julia seemed shocked. \u201cHe finally dumped her. I would have thought he\u2019d keep her on the side, but perhaps his father told him to cut her loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t surprise me. The election is next year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow there\u2019s a wedding.\u201d Julia shook her head. \u201cNothing like a little matrimonial window dressing to make the campaign appear more family friendly. I just wish Natalie would leave me out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in it. At least for now.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s mouth settled into a grim line. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that Jack will be paying Natalie and her apartment another visit. What do you want me to tell him about the flash drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him to destroy everything.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel huffed in frustration, running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t deserve your mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis fianc\u00e9e does, whoever she is. She\u2019ll be humiliated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a stupid girl if she\u2019s involved with him.\u201d</p><p>Julia winced.</p> <p>\u201cI was a stupid girl once.\u201d Her voice was so soft, Gabriel had to strain to hear her.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t stupid; you were manipulated. Come on, don\u2019t you want them to suffer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this way.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet, placing his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cI do! Think about what he did to you. Think about what she did. They made you suffer for years. They nearly destroyed you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they didn\u2019t,\u201d she said quietly, to his retreating back.</p><p>He walked toward the window and moved the curtains, staring out over Central Park.</p><p>\u201cI broke his jaw, and it still didn\u2019t give me satisfaction.\u201d Gabriel examined the bare, snow-covered branches of the trees. \u201cI wanted to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou acted in self-defense. If you hadn\u2019t come to my rescue . . .\u201d She shuddered in remembrance of the day she was almost raped. \u201cBut what you\u2019re asking me to do isn\u2019t self-defense.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her over his shoulder. \u201cNo. It\u2019s justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe spoke once, about mercy seasoning justice. We spoke about penance and forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Because even though I could demand justice, in this case, I decline. To quote one of our favorite novels, to God I respectfully return the ticket.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re misquoting Dostoyevsky for your own Franciscan purposes.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled at his indignation.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry with me for not wanting to punish them. But, darling, think of his mother. She was kind to me. This will kill her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t take his eyes from the trees.</p><p>\u201cYou threatened to go to the press yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell them the truth, not to share the pictures. And only if Natalie gave me no other choice.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s right hand formed a fist, which he brought to rest against the window, resisting the urge to punch through the glass.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair that someone as sweet as Julianne was neglected by her mother and father and left to a cruel and manipulative boyfriend.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair that Suzanne Emerson was left to cling to the scraps her lover fed her, while he lavished love on his family.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair that Grace and Maia died while others lived.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair that Tom and Diane were expecting a baby with a damaged heart.</p><p>No, the universe wasn\u2019t fair. And if that weren\u2019t lamentable enough, when the opportunities came for justice, Franciscans like Julianne turned the other cheek and spoke of mercy.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p>She\u2019d turned the other cheek to him.</p><p>As had Grace.</p><p>As had Maia.</p><p>With a deep sigh, he focused his attention on Assisi and what had happened to him when he visited the crypt. God had met him there, but not with justice. With mercy.</p><p>\u201cCall your uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and unclenched his fist but didn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>\u201cJust call him. Tell him what you want him to do.\u201d</p><p>Julianne tugged the sheet free, winding it around her petite frame. She went to him, bringing her front to his back.</p><p>\u201cYou want to protect me. You want justice. I love you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still wish I\u2019d killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have.\u201d She pressed her cheek against his shoulder blade.</p><p>His muscles tensed. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me, you\u2019re kind to me, and you treat me with respect. The longer I\u2019m with you, the more everything having to do with him seems like a bad dream. So in many ways, you have killed him. You\u2019ve killed his memory. Thank you, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel closed his eyes as a great wave of love and something he couldn\u2019t quite name washed over him.</p><p>Julia kissed his shoulders and went to call her uncle.</p><p>Chapter Sixty-two</p><p>That evening, Julia and Gabriel dined at Kelly\u2019s Manhattan apartment with her husband, Jonathan, and their daughters, Andrea and Meredith.</p><p>Julia felt welcomed by Gabriel\u2019s family. By the end of the evening, they were visiting like old friends rather than strangers.</p><p>Kelly gave Gabriel a pair of cuff links and an old Brooklyn Dodgers cap that had belonged to their father, along with several books that had been written by their grandfather.</p><p>Gabriel gave Kelly the knowledge that the train engine he had, was, in fact, their father\u2019s. He\u2019d carved the initials \u201cO.S.\u201d into it as a boy, when his name had been Othniel Spiegel.</p><p>The Emersons invited the Schultzes to visit in Cambridge or Selinsgrove, and there was talk of a joint holiday in the Hamptons the following summer. Kelly made sure that Gabriel promised to attend the next meeting of the Rabbi Benjamin Spiegel Foundation. She was looking forward to introducing her brother to the cousins.</p><p>Back at the Ritz before bedtime, Julia checked her email. She was wearing the Dodgers cap, since it was almost too small for Gabriel\u2019s head.</p><p>(A fact she pointed out with no little amusement.)</p><p>She stared at her laptop screen from behind her tortoiseshell glasses.</p><p>\u201cScheisse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really need to start teaching you to curse in a different language. I\u2019ve heard that Farsi has some particularly colorful expletives.\u201d Gabriel smirked as he walked toward her, clad in a plush hotel bathrobe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure Farsi could capture what I feel when I look at this.\u201d Julia pointed to the screen.</p><p>Gabriel picked up his glasses and put them on. He gazed at the scanned black-and-white engagement photo, recognizing Simon Talbot immediately.</p><p>He resisted the urge to curse. \u201cWho\u2019s the woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know Senator Hudson from North Carolina? That\u2019s his daughter. She\u2019s a senior at Duke.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel and Julianne exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cHer family is very conservative. How did she end up with him?\u201d Gabriel sounded contemptuous.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. But I can understand why Natalie is upset. Simon dumped her for the Jacqueline Bouvier of fianc\u00e9es. Look at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho sent you the photo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel. It was published in The Philadelphia Inquirer.\u201d</p><p>Julia turned back to her laptop, gazing sadly at the photograph of the smiling couple.</p><p>\u201cI feel sorry for her. She has no idea what she\u2019s getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she does but doesn\u2019t care.\u201d Gabriel tugged on the brim of her ball cap. \u201cThis looks good on you. I didn\u2019t take you for a Dodgers fan.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI\u2019m embracing your Brooklyn heritage.\u201d</p><p>The next day, Julianne finished her seminar paper while Gabriel attended to business, researching his grandfather in the Columbia University archives. That afternoon, they joined Kelly and Jonathan in paying a visit to Aunt Sarah at a nursing home in Queens.</p><p>After an evening spent shopping and then dining at the Russian Tea Room, they returned to the hotel. The room was bathed in candlelight as Julia moved atop him. Her hands rested on his chest, stroking him.</p><p>He gripped her hips, urging her to increase her pace.</p><p>\u201cSay my name,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She gasped as he thrust up inside her.</p><p>\u201cGabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing could enflame me the way your voice does when you say my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer, his lips moving across her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou inspire me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m intense. I\u2019m with my beautiful wife, having fantastic sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like we\u2019re the only ones in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he mumbled, watching her as she moved up and down and up and down.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel beautiful.\u201d</p><p>In response, he licked her breast until she began to groan.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes grew determined as he urged her to go faster.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be proud to have a baby with you,\u201d she managed, just before lifting her chin and closing her eyes. Her body shook as the pleasure coursed through her.</p><p>He continued thrusting, watching as she climaxed. Then he quickened his pace, planting himself with one great thrust before he came.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you joined me in New York.\u201d Gabriel held Julia\u2019s hand as they waited to check in for their flight back to Boston. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t get to see a show, but at least we saw some of the sights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, you braved the crowds to take me Christmas shopping. I don\u2019t have anything to complain about.\u201d She pressed a kiss to his lips. \u201cThey\u2019re going to charge us for having overweight bags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see them try. It\u2019s Christmas, damn it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSo it is. Somehow, I can\u2019t imagine you sitting through an entire Broadway show.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sniffed. \u201cI\u2019d see Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe musical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.

Gabriel stood at her side, a questioning look on his face.</p> <p>Tom cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m at the Children\u2019s Hospital in Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Are Diane and the baby all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiane woke up in the middle of the night feeling funny and so we drove here right away.\u201d Tom paused. \u201cRight now, they have her hooked up to a bunch of monitors but she and the baby are fine. However\u201d\u2014he paused again\u2014\u201cshe started going into labor a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s early,\u201d Julia breathed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Tom\u2019s voice was tight. \u201cThey won\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing until he\u2019s delivered. The doctors say there are lots of things they can\u2019t see on an ultrasound. They might have to work on his heart immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he need surgery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe corrective surgery is scheduled for three days after delivery, give or take. I suppose he might need surgery before, depending on what they find.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked at Gabriel. \u201cWe\u2019re at JFK in New York, getting ready to fly back to Boston. Would you like me to come home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. If you can. She\u2019ll probably still be in labor when you arrive, but it would be good to have you here. It\u2019s going to be a long three days and I don\u2019t know if\u2014\u201d He began coughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming. Okay? I\u2019ll change my flight and head straight to the hospital. I\u2019ll call you when I arrive so you can tell me where to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He sounded relieved. \u201cJules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Dad. Give my love to Diane.\u201d</p><p>Julia disconnected the call and looked up at her husband. His expression was grim.</p><p>\u201cI guess I should have spoken to you before I promised I\u2019d go to Philadelphia.\u201d She chewed at the inside of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency. We have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby will be my nephew. And I\u2019m not letting you go by yourself.\u201d He pulled her into his side, leading her through the crowd.</p><p>Chapter Sixty-three</p><p>Jules?\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s hand was on her shoulder, trying to awaken her. She was seated in a chair in the Special Delivery Unit waiting room. Gabriel was standing nearby, nursing a very bad coffee.</p><p>(Fortunately, he\u2019d restrained himself and elected not to complain to the hospital administration about the sad state of their vending machines.)</p><p>Julia opened her eyes, squinting against the overhead light.</p><p>Her father crouched in front of her. \u201cWe had the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had to do a procedure right away, but now he\u2019s recovering and Diane is with him.\u201d Tom pulled his cell phone out of his pocket and held it out to her. \u201cHe\u2019s a good-looking boy.\u201d</p><p>Julia scrolled through a series of pictures of a tired but glowing Diane and a mocha-skinned boy who had black, curly hair.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful, Dad. I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d She handed the phone back.</p><p>Tom looked at the last picture for a moment, his thumb grazing across the baby\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cThomas Lamar Mitchell. Seven pounds, ten ounces. Born today, December eleventh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were naming him after yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boy should have his father\u2019s name,\u201d Tom\u2019s voice was gruff. \u201cAnyway, Diane wants to call him Tommy. For now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Tommy it is.\u201d Julia glanced over at her husband, who was frowning into his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cYou kids should go back to the hotel. I\u2019ll call if anything changes. You won\u2019t be able to see him today. They\u2019re keeping an eye on him, and hopefully they\u2019ll operate on his heart in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad.\u201d Julia wrapped her arms around her father, hugging him. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixty-four</p><p>So how\u2019s the baby?\u201d Rachel leaned across the dining room table in her parents\u2019 former house.</p><p>It was two nights before Christmas. Julia had just rejoined Gabriel\u2019s extended family at the table, after speaking with her father on the telephone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. I guess it\u2019s normal practice for the baby to remain in the hospital until a month after surgery. He\u2019ll be able to come home in January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must be hard on your dad and Diane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but they\u2019re staying with the baby. Dad was going to take a leave of absence from Susquehanna, but they gave him family leave with pay.\u201d Julia smiled. \u201cHow\u2019s that for a caring employer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the hospital bills?\u201d Rachel lowered her voice.</p><p>\u201cA guardian angel is taking care of what the insurance doesn\u2019t cover.\u201d Julia\u2019s eyes flickered in the direction of her husband, then returned to her friend.</p><p>\u201cSome guardian angels are so damn sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two whispering about?\u201d Gabriel leaned into their conversation.</p><p>Julia grinned. \u201cMy new brother. I can\u2019t wait to buy him his first Red Sox cap.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel made a face. \u201cYour father will burn it. He\u2019s a Phillies fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t burn a gift from me. I\u2019m the big sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSisters are very important,\u201d said Rachel, solemnly. \u201cRemember that when you go shopping for my Christmas gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to do that.\u201d Gabriel pushed his chair back from the table and stood. He lifted his water glass.</p><p>Everyone stopped what they were doing, including Quinn, who sat still in his high chair, staring at his uncle.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot to be thankful for.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s eyes met Julianne\u2019s and held them. Then he took his time, making eye contact with his siblings and their spouses, and finally, with his father, who sat at the foot of the table.</p><p>\u201cMom had a habit of forcing everyone to say what they were thankful for, during dinners like this. I thought I\u2019d cut to the chase and announce that I\u2019m thankful for my beautiful wife, my new job, and my new nephew, Tommy.\u201d</p><p>The adults lifted their wine glasses in response, drinking to Tommy\u2019s health.</p><p>\u201cI know that everyone heard the toast I made to Mom at Rachel and Aaron\u2019s wedding.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice suddenly grew hoarse. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to repeat part of it.\u201d</p><p>As everyone at the table indicated their agreement, Julia saw Gabriel\u2019s hand tremble slightly. She quietly slipped her hand into his and was gratified when he squeezed her softly.</p><p>\u201cThis evening would be incomplete if we didn\u2019t acknowledge the absence of our mother, Grace. Grace was gracious and beautiful, a loving wife, and a devoted mother. Her capacity for goodness and compassion knew no bounds. She was generous and kind and very, very forgiving. She welcomed me into her home. She mothered me when I had no mother, even when I was difficult. She taught me what it is to love someone selflessly and absolutely, and without her and Dad I\u2019d probably be dead.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel paused and looked at Richard and Julia.</p><p>\u201cRecently, I had the opportunity to find out more about my biological parents, including my Jewish heritage through my father. When I chose to read a passage from the Hebrew Bible at Rachel and Aaron\u2019s wedding, I didn\u2019t know about my background. Now the Scripture is even more meaningful and I can say, as I said before, that it expresses Grace\u2019s love for her family.\u201d</p><p>He freed himself from Julia\u2019s grasp and pulled a folded piece of paper from his pocket and began to read.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.</p><p>The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so he shall have no need of spoil.</p><p>She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes sought Julia\u2019s, and for a moment the world stopped as he saw amazement and love radiate from her face.</p><p>\u201c\u2018She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</p><p>She is like the merchants\u2019 ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p><p>She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. . . .</p><p>She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. . . .</p><p>She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p><p>She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</p><p>She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.</p><p>Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. . . .</p><p>Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</p><p>She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. . . .</p><p>Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.</p><p>Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. . . .\u2019</p><p>\u201cI ask you all to drink to the memory of our mother, Grace.\u201d</p><p>By the time everyone drained their glasses, there was barely a dry eye among them.</p><p>Chapter Sixty-five</p><p>December 2011</p><p>Near Essex Junction, Vermont</p><p>Two nights before Christmas, Paul was working in the barn, deep in thought.</p><p>(Parenthetically, it should be noted that he was also deep in something else. Something organic.)</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>His sister Heather had wandered almost silently into the barn and was now staring at him, arms folded across her chest.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d He continued working, speaking to her over his shoulder. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris had to look at one of the Andersons\u2019 horses. They think it has colic. He\u2019ll be out most of the night, so I asked him to drop me off.

I\u2019m meeting with six different colleges at the Modern Language Association convention in January. That\u2019s a lot of pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Heather gazed at her big brother skeptically.</p> <p>\u201cI have an interview with St. Mike\u2019s. If they hire me, I could help Dad out on the weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news. I\u2019ll put in a good word with St. Michael, himself, asking that he see to it that you get the job.\u201d</p><p>Heather cocked her head to one side and listened to the music that was playing in the background. It was a cover of \u201cIn the Sun\u201d and Paul was listening to it on repeat, over and over again.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re excited about your job prospects, then why the hell are you listening to this? I\u2019m ready to slit my wrists already and I just got here.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her and began walking in the opposite direction.</p> <p>She followed.</p><p>\u201cI ran into Ali the other day at Hannaford\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go out once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean on a date, not as friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe broke up.\u201d He laid emphasis on the words. \u201cA couple of years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris wants to go snowboarding in Stowe for New Year\u2019s. He\u2019s going to rent a place so we don\u2019t have to drive back and forth. Invite Ali and come with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Heather reached out and caught her brother\u2019s arm, stopping him midmotion. \u201cYes, it is. It will be like old times. Ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave Mom here by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you hired extra help. Virgil.\u201d Heather gave him a toothy grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Virgil. I\u2019m Dante,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He turned away.</p><p>\u201cLook, big guy, you need to blow off some steam. You\u2019re letting things fester. I can see it.\u201d She grinned at him impishly and tried to tickle him. \u201cFester, fester, fester.\u201d</p><p>Paul swatted her hands away. \u201cIf I say yes, will you bug off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Now get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll make coffee. And when you come to the house, I\u2019ll expect you to call her.\u201d</p><p>Heather disappeared from the barn and Paul stood still for a moment, wondering what he had just agreed to.</p><p>Chapter Sixty-six</p><p>December 27, 2011</p><p>Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania</p><p>Richard, his children, and their spouses were gathered around the dining room table enjoying dessert and coffee. Rachel was updating everyone on her fertility treatments.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m on hormones. But I feel better than I did on the pill. It made me emotional.\u201d</p><p>Aaron lifted his eyebrows behind Rachel\u2019s back, and everyone laughed at his incredulous expression. Everyone, save Rachel and Julianne.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes drifted to his wife, noticing that her eyes had narrowed. She began staring so hard at the table that he wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if the wood started to blacken and burn under her gaze.</p><p>Suddenly, she pushed herself back from the table and bolted, her chair toppling over. Gabriel righted the chair and excused himself, climbing the stairs two at a time in an effort to catch up with her.</p><p>When he reached their bedroom, Julia was pawing through the contents of her nightstand. She pulled the drawer out and dumped the contents on the bed, spreading the items out into a single layer.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d She cursed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d His hand caught only air as she brushed past him.</p><p>He followed her into the en-suite, watching her empty her makeup case onto the counter. She tossed items aside frantically, an expression of distress breaching her lips.</p><p>\u201cJulianne, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind what?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, he grasped her arm. \u201cJulianne, find what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy birth control pills.\u201d</p><p>For an instant her panic traveled through him, but only for an instant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re here somewhere. When\u2019s the last time you saw them?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, her eyes flickering to the side.</p><p>\u201cIn Cambridge,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Now his eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cNot in New York? Not here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on my period just before you left for New York, remember? I should have started a new pack of pills that Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI was on my way to see you. I was in such a hurry to make it to the airport, I forgot them. And then while we were in New York . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling.\u201d He reached for her but she turned away, covering her face with her hands.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve missed almost an entire month of pills and only realized it now. I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t an idiot.\u201d He pulled on her wrist and moved so that he was encircling her with his arms. \u201cYou were in a hurry to meet me in New York. Then we had the call from your father at the airport. You\u2019ve had a lot on your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing your surgery hasn\u2019t kicked in yet.\u201d</p><p>A shadow passed over Gabriel\u2019s features, but then it was gone, like an errant cloud on a summer\u2019s day.</p><p>\u201cSo I just need a replacement package of pills until I get back to Boston.\u201d Julia explained her situation to the pharmacist the following morning.</p><p>The pharmacist nodded. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I\u2019ll call your pharmacy back home. It should only take a few minutes. Just have a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Julia rejoined Gabriel in the waiting area that was nestled inside the small Selinsgrove pharmacy.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d He gave her a concerned look.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take too long.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pulled out his iPhone and began pressing some buttons.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She looked over at him with interest.</p><p>\u201cWhile you were talking to the pharmacist, I was checking our messages. My urologist\u2019s office called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you call him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d Julia frowned. \u201cWhy is he calling you over Christmas vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was expecting a call a couple of weeks ago about my latest test results. There probably hasn\u2019t been a change.\u201d He looked unhappy.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said it could take up to a year. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Julia took his left hand in hers.</p><p>He kissed the back of her hand before standing and walking to the front of the store.</p><p>By the time he returned, Julia had already received her prescription, paid for it, and taken the first pill.</p><p>Gabriel planted his feet, staring at her prescription bag.</p><p>She looked up into wide, conflicted eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d He moved to touch the small of her back, guiding her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk in the car.\u201d</p><p>Julia dutifully walked with him to the Jeep, which was parked outside. It was the vehicle that Gabriel kept in Selinsgrove simply for convenience.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo need to panic.\u201d He opened the passenger door, waiting until she was situated before closing it.</p><p>When he climbed into the driver\u2019s seat, he didn\u2019t bother placing his key in the ignition. He simply put his iPhone on the dashboard and turned to her.</p><p>Julia could see by his expression that he was struggling.</p><p>\u201cWas it bad news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel took her hand in his, tracing the hills and valleys of her knuckles with his thumb. He stopped at her wedding band.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She met his eyes, her heart beginning to pound in her chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to panic, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, I\u2019m panicking. Just spit it out.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor\u2019s office called to give me my latest test results. They were supposed to call two weeks ago, but there was an\u2014anomaly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn anomaly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe test results were positive.\u201d He was speaking slowly, very slowly, his eyes searching hers.</p><p>Then he waited for the import of his revelation to sink in.</p><p>She blinked. Several times. \u201cSo you\u2019re\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s hasn\u2019t been three months yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. They repeated the test and received the same results. Apparently, the doctor would like to use my story as a testimonial.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s proud smile disappeared when he saw Julia\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cEven if I\u2019m fertile, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ve been on the pill since September. It would take more than a month for your system to get back to normal, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They warn you to use backup birth control if you miss a couple of pills. And I missed a whole package.\u201d Julia lifted a shaking hand to her mouth.</p><p>Gabriel wrapped his arm around her shoulder, drawing her close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back into the drugstore and buy a pregnancy test. Then we\u2019ll know for sure.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening.\u201d She dropped her face into her hands.</p><p>Gabriel flinched.</p><p>\u201cWould it really be so terrible?\u201d he mumbled, rubbing his chin.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, he touched her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Julia leaned back against the headrest and closed her eyes, calling on all deities named and unnamed to come to her aid.</p><p>Chapter Sixty-seven</p><p>December 28, 2011</p><p>Washington, D.C.</p><p>Natalie Lundy stared at her cell phone and cursed. She\u2019d placed call after call, leaving message after message, but now the number she\u2019d been dialing for several weeks was no longer in service. Simon had changed his number. And her emails had gone unanswered.</p><p>She gazed at the cardboard box that sat on the floor, its contents silently mocking her. She was jobless.</p><p>The day after the announcement of Simon\u2019s engagement, she\u2019d been summoned to the office of Senator Talbot\u2019s campaign manager. At least Robert had had the good sense to be embarrassed about what he was about to do.</p><p>\u201cWe have to let you go,\u201d he said, avoiding her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re overstaffed. The senator wants us to make some cuts, and personnel are the first thing to go. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Natalie lifted a single eyebrow at him. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with my relationship with Simon, would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Robert lied smoothly. \u201cIt\u2019s business, not personal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that Godfather bullshit. I\u2019ve seen the movie.\u201d</p><p>Robert\u2019s eyes moved to the space behind her, and he nodded. \u201cAlex here will walk you out. If you want, I can make a phone call to Harrisburg and see about getting you a position with one of the state senators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself.\u201d She stood to her feet. \u201cYou can tell the senator and his son to do the same thing. They want to be rid of me, fine. But this isn\u2019t over. I\u2019m sure Andrew Sampson at the Post would be interested in hearing what I have to say about the way the Talbots do business.\u201d</p><p>Robert lifted his hand. \u201cNow don\u2019t get carried away. As I said, I can get you a job in Harrisburg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be in fucking Harrisburg, Robert. I\u2019d like to know why I\u2019m getting screwed. I did my job and I did it well. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Robert\u2019s eyes flickered to Alex. \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d</p><p>Alex withdrew, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cListen, Natalie. You don\u2019t want to make threats that you aren\u2019t prepared to carry out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014I am prepared to carry them out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be prudent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with prudence.\u201d</p><p>Robert shifted in his seat. \u201cOf course, the campaign will provide you with a generous severance package. The details will be sent to your apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeverance for being terminated due to financial exigency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She picked up her purse and headed to the door. \u201cTell Simon he has twenty-four hours to call me. If I don\u2019t hear from him, he\u2019s going to be sorry.\u201d</p> <p>And with that, she opened the door and stomped into the hall.</p><p>It had been more than two weeks, and Simon hadn\u2019t called. The damning evidence she\u2019d sent to The Washington Post had been delivered. Fed Ex gave her confirmation of the fact. But she hadn\u2019t heard from Andrew Sampson or anyone else. Perhaps he\u2019d decided not to run the story. Perhaps it was too tawdry.</p><p>The day after her trip to Fed Ex, her apartment had been trashed. It didn\u2019t take a great deal of intelligence to figure out that the thief had been someone from the senator\u2019s campaign. They\u2019d taken her laptop, her digital camera, her files, and her flash drives. She no longer had anything that she could use to blackmail Simon or anyone else.</p><p>She\u2019d received the hush money\u2014twenty-five thousand dollars. It was enough, she thought, to help her start a new life in California. It wouldn\u2019t hurt for her to move away and start anew, using Senator Talbot\u2019s money. She could plot her revenge on the Talbots from Sacramento.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any evidence for her allegations, so it was unlikely that any respectable journalist would take her seriously. But she could bide her time and sell her story to a tabloid as an October surprise. That should do it.</p><p>She smiled to herself, as she began packing her worldly goods.</p><p>Chapter Sixty-eight</p><p>December 28, 2011</p> <p>Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania</p><p>Julia and Gabriel were standing in the en-suite of their bathroom in Richard\u2019s house, eyeing two different pregnancy tests that were sitting on the vanity. Both tests displayed the same result.</p><p>\u201cJulianne?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice was a heartbreaking whisper.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t looking at him; she was staring at the tests. She stood still, like a deer trying to evade a predator.</p><p>\u201cThis is my fault.\u201d He lifted a hand to touch her but then thought better of it.</p><p>She turned her head, as if she were suddenly aware of his presence.</p><p>\u201cHow is it your fault?\u201d</p><p>He paused, struggling for words.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t protect you. I knew how anxious you were about getting pregnant. I should have worn a condom. I should have asked you about your pills.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cI failed you.\u201d</p><p>Julia closed her eyes and drew a very deep breath. \u201cGabriel, you didn\u2019t fail me. I\u2019m the idiot who forgot her pills.\u201d A tear slid from the corner of her eye and down her face.</p><p>He caught it with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. You aren\u2019t an idiot. You were in a hurry because you were trying to get to me. As usual, you were worrying about someone other than yourself.\u201d</p><p>More tears traced the planes of her pretty face, and her shoulders began to shake.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>He moved into her and her fingers gripped his shirt, clutching him as if she were drowning.</p><p>Chapter Sixty-nine</p><p>That night the Emersons had difficulty sleeping. Julia was plagued by fear and guilt\u2014fear about what would happen to her academic aspirations and guilt at placing such a high priority on them. Gabriel was conflicted. On the one hand, he was ecstatic that they were expecting a child. But Julianne\u2019s concern and evident distress prevented him from displaying his true feelings. He, too, was mired in guilt for not having protected her.</p><p>Of course, neither one of them expected that the vasectomy reversal would be successful so soon, if at all.</p><p>While everyone else in Richard\u2019s household spent the day in leisurely community, Julia stayed in bed. She was exhausted. Certainly, she wasn\u2019t prepared to face Rachel and Aaron, even though she and Gabriel had agreed that they would wait until the three-month mark to announce their pregnancy.</p><p>Gabriel spent the day trying to pretend that he hadn\u2019t received what was potentially the best news of his life. He resolved to give Julianne the time and space she seemed to need to come to grips with what was, for her, a startling disappointment.</p><p>Late that evening, she was curved into a ball, lying on her side in the large bed. Everyone else in the house was fast asleep. Everyone except her husband.</p><p>Gabriel was spooned behind her, his arm wrapped loosely about her waist. She\u2019d slept most of the day, so of course she wasn\u2019t tired now. Even though he skirted the edge of exhaustion, his concern for her prevented him from resting.</p><p>Her deepest fear had been realized. She was pregnant and only midway through her second year of a seven-year doctoral program.</p><p>She sniffled at the thought.</p><p>Instinctively, Gabriel drew her closer to him, his hand splaying across her lower abdomen.</p><p>For a few moments, he allowed himself the luxury of wondering what his life would have been like if Maia had been born. He\u2019d barely had time for Paulina when she was pregnant. He doubted his attitude would have changed when she had the baby.</p><p>His stomach rolled. He could see himself hurling expletives at her to keep the baby quiet as Maia cried, disrupting his writing. Paulina would have had to bear the burden of parenthood alone. He wouldn\u2019t have taken the time to feed the baby, or rock her to sleep, or, God forbid, change a diaper. He\u2019d been a self-centered, drug-using bastard back then. It would have been negligence on Paulina\u2019s part to leave Maia in his care.</p><p>He would have moved out, leaving Paulina to cope with Maia by herself. Oh, he might have given her money. But his addiction would have eaten all his funds until it eventually killed him. Then Paulina and Maia would have been alone.</p><p>Even if he\u2019d gone into treatment and miraculously made it through, he still couldn\u2019t imagine being an active, involved father. No. The old professor would have been too busy writing books and trying to further his career. He would have sent birthday cards and money, or, more probably, had his secretary or maybe one of the many women in his life send them for him.</p><p>In short, he would have been like his father, fighting with Paulina on the telephone over his lack of involvement until he finally tired of the conflict and ceased contact altogether. His vision of what his life would have been like was very clear.</p><p>He grounded himself by tightening his hold on Julianne. He was no longer the old professor; he was a new man. He resolved with everything that was in him to be the best, most active, attentive husband and father he could be.</p><p>The first thing he needed to do was to comfort his wife. Then he needed to take steps to ensure that she didn\u2019t lose everything she\u2019d worked for since she was in high school.</p><p>He opened his mouth to begin whispering to her, but Julia extricated herself, tossing the blankets aside and moving toward the closet. He heard her switch on the light and start rummaging through some clothes.</p><p>Gabriel followed. By the time he made it to the closet, she\u2019d pulled on a pair of jeans and one of his old cashmere sweaters and was searching for socks.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d She didn\u2019t look at him as she leaned over to put on a pair of his argyle socks.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I might go for a drive. Clear my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going with you.\u201d He reached over to pull a shirt off a hanger.</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cGabriel, I need time to think.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a pair of jeans and a sweater from one of the shelves.</p><p>\u201cRemember what I said in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said a lot of things in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that being apart was a bad idea. You agreed with me. We\u2019re partners, remember?\u201d</p><p>She kicked at the hardwood beneath her argyle socks. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shut me out.\u201d His tone was almost pleading.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what to say to you. This is my darkest nightmare come true!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rocked back on his heels, almost as if he\u2019d been struck.</p><p>\u201cNightmare?\u201d he whispered. \u201cNightmare?\u201d</p><p>Julia couldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I need time to think. I don\u2019t know how to express what I feel without hurting you. I\u2019m going to lose everything I\u2019ve worked for because of this. You can\u2019t imagine how much this hurts.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jumped in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who was hesitant for us to have a baby.\u201d His voice was low. \u201cThis has brought up all my old anxieties, too.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, her eyes flashing.</p><p>\u201cYou know me, Gabriel. You know I won\u2019t do anything to take this away from you.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a look before she bent her eyes to the floor.</p><p>\u201cLet me go with you. We don\u2019t have to talk. I just want to be near you.\u201d His tone grew gentle.</p><p>Julia realized that he was trying very hard to be considerate, even though his first instinct was to take charge and take over.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, reluctantly.</p><p>They walked downstairs and bundled up against the cold, winding scarves around their necks. In the hall closet Gabriel retrieved his beret and Julia found an old knitted cap that belonged to Rachel.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you think of a walk?\u201d He toyed with the keys he\u2019d left on the hall table.</p><p>\u201cA walk? It\u2019s freezing out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to walk long. The fresh air will help you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Julia followed him through the living room and into the kitchen, where he retrieved a flashlight.</p><p>Then she was following him out the back door and onto the snow-covered patio.</p><p>He didn\u2019t offer his hand but kept close to her, as if he were worried she might fall.</p><p>They walked in silence into the woods, their breath making ghostlike ribbons in the air. When they arrived at the orchard, Julia leaned against the old rock, hugging her arms tightly around her middle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe keep coming back here.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood in front of her, shining the flashlight beam to the side.</p><p>\u201cYes, we do. This place reminds me of what\u2019s important. It reminds me of you.\u201d</p><p>Julia turned away from the concern that she saw on his face.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lot of happy memories from here.\u201d His voice took on a wistful tone. \u201cOur first night together, the night we made plans to consummate our love, our engagement . . .\u201d He smiled. \u201cThat night back in the summer when we made love just over there.\u201d</p><p>She followed his gesture to the space on which they\u2019d lain entwined. Images and emotions crashed over her. She could almost feel his arms about her, skin against skin.</p><p>\u201cSeveral months ago I was apprehensive about having a child. You persuaded me to have hope; to look forward and not to the past. Our hope was rewarded with the knowledge that my family tree is not entirely cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod is punishing me,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>His forehead furrowed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod is punishing me. I wanted to graduate from Harvard and become a professor. Now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Gabriel interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>He removed one of his leather gloves and brought his hand to the side of her neck, just under her ear.</p><p>\u201cBecause a young woman, wise beyond her years, told me so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believed her?\u201d She looked up at him, eyes brimming.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s never lied to me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd when a brown-eyed angel speaks to you, it\u2019s best to listen.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed mirthlessly. \u201cI think your brown-eyed angel screwed up.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face grew pained before he exerted control over his features. But she saw his expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d She reached for him and he moved closer, moving his other hand to cup her neck as well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say that won\u2019t make me look like a patriarchal, unfeeling asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really, Professor?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together, his eyes guarded. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p> <p>His thumbs stroked her jaw synchronously.</p><p>\u201cI know this isn\u2019t what you want. I know the timing is terrible. But I can\u2019t help it.\u201d His thumbs stilled. \u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m going to be a mother twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. I\u2019ll never be able to study for my general exams and research my dissertation. Not while I have to look after a baby. This is exactly what I was afraid was going to happen.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut and two tears escaped, trailing down her cheeks.</p><p>Gabriel wiped them away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re speaking as if you\u2019ll be a single parent, Julianne. But you won\u2019t. I\u2019ll make sure that all the responsibility for the baby doesn\u2019t fall to you. I\u2019ll speak to Rebecca and ask her to move in with us. Maybe I could take a paternity leave or use my sabbatical. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaternity leave? Are you serious?\u201d Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cDeadly.\u201d He shifted his boots in the snow. \u201cIt would be a nightmare for the baby, I\u2019m sure, to be left with me. But I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to guarantee that you finish your program. If that means taking a paternity leave or using my sabbatical, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never looked after a baby before.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gave her a look that could only be described as prim.</p><p>\u201cI went to Princeton, Oxford, and Harvard. I can certainly learn how to look after a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking after a baby is not like conquering the Ivy League.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do research. I\u2019ll buy all the relevant books on newborns and study them before the baby arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour colleagues will ridicule you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them.\u201d His blue eyes grew fierce.</p><p>The edges of Julia\u2019s mouth turned up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be up to your elbows in dirty diapers and burping cloths, surviving on a few hours\u2019 sleep, and trying to soothe a cranky, colicky tyrant by reading Goodnight Moon over and over. In English. Because I don\u2019t think Dante successfully completed his Italian translation of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo quote a common, urban saying: Bring it on.\u201d</p><p>She grasped his wrist with her hand. \u201cYour department will marginalize you. They\u2019ll say you aren\u2019t serious about your research. Their opinions might diminish the likelihood of you winning grants or further sabbaticals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a full professor with tenure. Fuck them.\u201d</p><p>For one impetuous moment, Julia was seized with the urge to laugh.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Julianne. Fuck them. What can they do to me? Barring anything Apocalyptic, they\u2019re stuck with me. How I choose to order my family life is none of their business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so determined to do this?\u201d She searched his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you. Because I love our child already, even though he or she is probably smaller than a grape.\u201d He stroked her cheeks with his thumbs. \u201cYou are not alone. You have a husband who loves you and is happy we\u2019re having a baby. You won\u2019t go through this by yourself.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his voice to a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m standing right here. Don\u2019t push me away.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, clutching his forearms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. But I swear to God, Julianne, it will be all right. I will make it all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if something goes wrong?\u201d</p><p>He brought their foreheads together. \u201cI hope nothing like that happens. But we shouldn\u2019t start this journey by thinking of all the terrible outcomes. You\u2019re the one who taught me to hope. Don\u2019t despair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could this happen?\u201d</p><p>He rummaged in his coat pocket for a handkerchief and gently wiped her face.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know how this happened, darling, then clearly I\u2019m not doing it right.\u201d</p><p>He tried to smother a smirk and failed. Completely.</p><p>Julia opened her eyes to see his own, slightly darkened with masculine pride.</p><p>\u201cSuperman,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI should have known you had magic in your genes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes, Mrs. Emerson, I do have magic in my jeans. I\u2019d happily put on a magic show for you at any time. All you need do is ask.\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled her eyes. \u201cVery funny, Superman.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her then, tenderly. It was the kiss of a man who\u2019d just received what he desired most from his beloved. A most desired, most unexpected gift.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I prayed for this,\u201d he said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cI did, too. More than once. I should have known that St. Francis would not have rested until he persuaded God to give us a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d He tapped her nose with his finger. \u201cA certain Dante scholar convinced me that St. Francis tended to get his point across with silence. Maybe he didn\u2019t say anything. Maybe he just stood there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he said something,\u201d Julia complained. \u201cThis is his way of showing me my lecture was wrong and he actually fought with the demon for Guido\u2019s soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that most sincerely. And so would Professor Wodehouse. In fact, I think St. Francis is probably bragging about you among the circle of the blessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give him much to brag about these last few days. I\u2019ve been spoiled and selfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re neither.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s tone grew severe. \u201cYou\u2019ve been taken by surprise, just like me, but you have more at stake. As I said before, I promise I\u2019ll take on more in order to even things out.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her tightly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect my prayers to be answered. I still can\u2019t get used to the idea that God would even listen to me, let alone decide to grant my requests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this is the lavishness of God\u2019s grace, given unexpectedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun dayn moyl in gots oyern.\u201d</p><p>Julia lifted her eyebrows. \u201cYiddish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. It means, \u2018From your mouth to God\u2019s ears.\u2019\u201d</p><p>A warm feeling expanded in her middle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to teach the baby Yiddish. And Italian. And about his famous great-grandfather, Professor Spiegel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his famous mother, Professor Julianne Emerson. You will finish your program, Julianne, and you will become a professor. I swear to it.\u201d</p><p>She burrowed her face in the wool of his winter coat.</p><p>Chapter Seventy</p><p>January 1, 2012</p><p>Stowe, Vermont</p><p>Paul found himself sitting next to the fireplace in a chalet in the wee hours of the morning. Heather and Chris had already retired to their bedroom, having rung the New Year in already, leaving Paul and Allison to drink their beer in companionable silence.</p><p>They were both seated on the floor. Allison was gazing at Paul with an inscrutable expression on her pretty face.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember our first time together?\u201d</p><p>He sat bolt upright and nearly expelled his beer.</p><p>He coughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why are you asking me that?\u201d</p><p>She looked away, visibly embarrassed. \u201cI was just wondering if you ever thought about it. I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have brought it up.\u201d</p><p>He began peeling the label from his bottle of Samuel Adams as he waited for his heart to start beating again.</p><p>\u201cIs that something you think about a lot? Our first time?\u201d Paul cared about Ali and didn\u2019t want to make her feel bad. He didn\u2019t want her to be ashamed of their past. He sure as hell wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cUm, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke up with me, remember?\u201d He picked at his beer bottle again. \u201cWhere are you going with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wondered if you ever thought about me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. But what are you trying to do\u2014torture me? I had to stop thinking about you like that, otherwise . . .\u201d Now it was his turn to look embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She wrapped her arms around her legs, resting her cheek on her knees. Her eyes found his in the firelight and she looked so lost. So sad.</p><p>Paul shifted to stare into the flames.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about?\u201d he asked at last.</p><p>\u201cThe way you smell. The way you sound when you whisper in my ear. The way you used to look at me when we . . .\u201d She gave him a half-smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t look at me like that anymore.</p><p>\u201cI understand why. It was my fault and I have to live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe everything happens for a reason.\u201d Paul kept his eyes fixed resolutely on the fire.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I just wish I could take it back. That I wasn\u2019t so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe long-distance thing was tough for me, too. We were arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were stupid arguments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Now he was looking at her.</p><p>\u201cStop saying that, okay? You did what you thought you should do. I got over it. End of story.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s what I\u2019m most sorry about,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you got over it.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met, and Paul swore he saw tears swimming in her eyes.</p> <p>She brushed at them quickly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, they\u2019re good memories, happy memories. But after you and I broke up and I started dating someone else, I couldn\u2019t help but think about it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dated a guy named Dave, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We worked together but not anymore. He moved to Montpelier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t date him for very long.\u201d</p> <p>She pillowed her cheek on her knees again. \u201cHe was nice enough, but not as nice as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d Paul\u2019s tone was wary.</p><p>\u201cNo. But when we had sex he wouldn\u2019t look at me. He always kept his eyes closed. I never felt like he was really there, you know? I felt like I could have been anybody. Any girl he\u2019d taken home with him, rather than his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAli, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but compare him to you. That\u2019s why I brought up our first time. How you insisted that we get to know each other really well before we had sex. How you booked a hotel just down the road for our first time.\u201d Her expression was wistful. \u201cYou always made me feel special, even before you told me you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are special.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him steadily.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we could pick up where we left off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She cringed.</p><p>He reached over to grasp her hand. \u201cI still have feelings for you. But I\u2019m not ready to jump into something right now. Even if I were, we can\u2019t just pick up where we left off. We\u2019re both different people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem that different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Allison squeezed his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve never trusted anyone more. I was jealous of Julia. Of the way you said her name. Because that\u2019s how you used to say my name. But I broke up with you and you fell for someone else. I would have kept my mouth shut if things worked out between you two. But they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Paul took another long pull from his beer and shook his head.</p><p>On January second, Paul had to leave for the Modern Language Association\u2019s annual convention, which was being held in Seattle. All his interviews for prospective jobs would take place during the convention.</p><p>Allison drove him to the airport in Burlington. Before he exited the car, she gave him a small gift bag.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just some chocolate chip cookies I made. There might even be a book in there.\u201d</p><p>Paul thanked her with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSense and Sensibility.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her quizzically. \u201cWhy are you giving me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might find it meaningful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too. Come here.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her into a warm embrace.</p><p>By way of response, she pulled back slightly before pressing a gentle but insistent kiss to his lips. She was surprised but elated when he didn\u2019t recoil but rather deepened their connection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home soon,\u201d he managed, when they finally pulled themselves apart.</p><p>She answered him with a hopeful grin, waving until he disappeared into the terminal.</p><p>Chapter Seventy-one</p><p>January 10, 2012</p><p>New York, New York</p><p>Christa Peterson breezed into the Department of Italian at Columbia University. She\u2019d enjoyed a very pleasant winter break at her parents\u2019 home in Toronto and had even met someone with whom she\u2019d enjoyed a brief affair. Now she was eager to resume her studies and continue her journey toward becoming a Dante specialist.</p><p>With interest, she emptied her pigeonhole of all its mail, sitting on a chair nearby in order to peruse it. Much of the mail was junk, with the exception of a single typewritten announcement. Christa scanned it quickly.</p><p>The announcement listed the names of three senior Dante specialists who would be visiting the department over the course of the next two weeks, as candidates for the vacant professorship. Christa read the names twice before relaxing in her chair.</p><p>She smiled. But not because of the names listed.</p><p>No, she smiled because a particular name had not been listed. It would seem that her plan to revenge herself on Professor Giuseppe Pacciani was already bearing fruit.</p><p>With that delightful thought in mind, she pocketed the announcement, threw the junk mail into the wastepaper basket, and was preparing to exit the department when Professor Barini stopped her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Peterson, I need to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Christa obediently followed the professor into her office.</p><p>Professor Barini left the door ajar before sitting behind her desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to thank you for taking my advice about Professor Pacciani. I noticed that he didn\u2019t make the short list.\u201d Christa made no attempt to hide her exultation.</p><p>Lucia ignored the comment and retrieved a file, quickly leafing through its contents. Then she looked at Christa over the rims of her glasses. \u201cYou\u2019ve run into a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA problem? What kind of problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to choose three professors to sit on your oral examination committee, but I\u2019ve been notified by the faculty that no one is willing to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Christa\u2019s dark eyes grew wide.</p><p>\u201cThis has never happened before. As the chair, I cannot compel a faculty member to serve on your committee. And even if I could, I wouldn\u2019t. Their lack of willingness to participate indicates that they don\u2019t think you\u2019ll perform to their satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>Christa couldn\u2019t quite believe her ears. It was unthinkable that every faculty member in the department would refuse to work with her. No one had given her even the slightest indication of that kind of antipathy.</p><p>(At least, to her face.)</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Lucia sighed. \u201cIt means that, unfortunately, we will be granting you a terminal MA as of May and that you will need to apply elsewhere to pursue your studies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>Lucia closed Christa\u2019s file with a snap of her wrist. \u201cThere are regulations about a student\u2019s satisfactory performance in the M.Phil program. According to the faculty, you are not performing satisfactory work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, but, this is outrageous!\u201d Christa sputtered. \u201cI\u2019ve completed all my assignments. I\u2019ve been getting decent grades. No one has offered me any critical feedback. You can\u2019t simply push me out of the program on a whim!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have whims here at Columbia, Miss Peterson. We have standards. While it\u2019s true you\u2019ve been passing your seminars, you still have to take the oral exam. As I mentioned, no one is willing to serve on your testing committee. That means you won\u2019t be able to complete the program.\u201d</p><p>Christa gazed around the room helplessly, trying to figure a way out of her predicament.</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to them. I\u2019ll go see the professors on my own and plead my case.\u201d</p><p>Lucia shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do that. At this point, they\u2019ve added a letter to your permanent file. If you go to them after the fact, they\u2019ll view it as harassment.\u201d</p><p>Christa scowled at the implication.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m not going to harass them.\u201d</p><p>Lucia gave her a long look. \u201cBe that as it may, I can\u2019t let you speak to them.\u201d</p><p>Christa felt the control she thought she\u2019d regained slip through her fingers.</p><p>(It didn\u2019t occur to her that this must have been how Professor Emerson and Julianne felt when they\u2019d been brought before the disciplinary committee in Toronto.)</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for me to apply to other programs. This will ruin me.\u201d Her chin began to wobble.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Many programs receive applications until March. My assistant can help you identify those programs. Perhaps you should consider returning to Canada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to stay here. Professor Martin said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Martin is not the chair here; I am.\u201d Lucia nodded at the door. \u201cI realize this is a disappointment, but perhaps at another university, you will be successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be something I can do. Please.\u201d Christa sat forward in her chair, begging.</p><p>\u201cYou can appeal to the dean, if you wish, but university regulations prevent her from demanding that faculty serve on specific examination committees. I\u2019m afraid she can\u2019t help you.\u201d Once again Lucia nodded at the door. \u201cMy assistant will help you research other programs. I wish you good luck.\u201d</p><p>Christa stared across the desk, in complete and utter shock. But as she exited the office, she remembered something, something Pacciani had said to her back in Oxford.</p><p>Be careful, Cristina. You don\u2019t want Professor Picton as an enemy. . . . Departments around the world are filled with her admirers. Your chair at Columbia was her student.</p><p>It angered her sorely that in the end, Pacciani had been correct. But as quickly as the realization came to her, so did a possible solution. She would simply have to pursue her education outside the patronage system of Professor Picton. And that meant that she would need to research every single professor in every department that offered a doctoral program in Dante studies.</p><p>She had days of work ahead of her, simply to find a possibility of enrolling in a doctoral program.</p><p>(It must be said parenthetically that karma had been served.)</p><p>Chapter Seventy-two</p><p>Fear and anxiety are not so easily managed, especially by people who have struggled for years with both. When the Emersons returned to Cambridge, they each made appointments to see their respective therapists, immediately.</p><p>Dr. Walters suggested several different strategies for Julia to cope with the anxiety over her pregnancy, but she stressed the fact that Julia needed to ask for help and that she also needed to accept it and not try to do everything on her own.</p><p>Dr. Townsend painstakingly addressed Gabriel\u2019s worries over the health and welfare of his wife and unborn child. But he was pleased with the progress Gabriel had made since the summer.</p><p>The Emersons also visited Dr. Rubio, who confirmed the pregnancy, estimating the due date would be around September sixth. A series of appointments were scheduled, including ultrasounds to monitor the progress of the baby and any issues relating to the uterine fibroids. Julia was urged to modify her diet and to take supplements, in order to ensure her health and the health of the baby.</p><p>She was also instructed to avoid oral sex with her husband.</p><p>\u201cCome again?\u201d The Professor\u2019s voice boomed in the small room.</p><p>\u201cNo male-on-female oral sex during pregnancy,\u201d Dr. Rubio repeated briskly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Rubio gazed at him coolly.</p><p>\u201cAnd where did you become board certified in obstetrics, Mr. Emerson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Professor Emerson, and I went to Harvard. Where did you go, an anti\u2013oral sex college?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDarling.\u201d Julia placed a restraining hand on his arm. \u201cDr. Rubio is trying to help us and the baby. We want to be healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCunnilingus is healthy,\u201d he huffed. \u201cI can prove it.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Rubio cursed obliquely in Spanish. \u201cIf air enters the vagina, it could cause an air embolism, which might harm the baby. I advise all my patients not to engage in that kind of oral sex. I\u2019m not picking on you especially, Professor Emerson. Now, I\u2019ll see you at your next appointment. Don\u2019t forget\u2014no caffeine, no raw milk products, no Brie or Camembert, no alcohol, no shellfish, no sushi, no peanut butter, and certainly, no oral sex.\u201d She glared in Gabriel\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cOne might as well say \u2018no pleasure.\u2019 What the hell is left?\u201d he complained, moodily.</p> <p>Julia giggled nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can find something. Thanks, Dr. Rubio.\u201d</p><p>And with that Gabriel drove Julia to the nearest Barnes and Noble, whereupon he bought no less than three pregnancy books, all of which stated that cunnilingus during pregnancy was fine, so long as air didn\u2019t enter the vagina.</p><p>Then the Emersons retired to their home, whereupon the Professor commenced proving his point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you should come with me to my next doctor\u2019s appointment,\u201d Julia mused as she dressed one morning.</p><p>It was January twenty-first, the date of their first wedding anniversary. Rebecca (who was delighted at the prospect of becoming a nanny in addition to her housekeeping duties) had rented out her house in Norwood and moved into one of the guest bedrooms. Julia found her presence comforting, especially since she and Gabriel no longer had mothers to guide them through pregnancy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to all your appointments. Rubio doesn\u2019t scare me.\u201d Gabriel sounded impatient as he buttoned up his dress shirt. \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t know everything, either.\u201d</p><p>Julia didn\u2019t bother arguing.</p><p>She was in her second month of pregnancy and was already feeling the effects. Her breasts had enlarged and were very tender. She was exhausted most of the time, and she\u2019d become sensitive to various scents. She\u2019d had to request that Gabriel no longer wear Aramis because she couldn\u2019t stand the smell. And she\u2019d gotten rid of all her vanilla-scented products and replaced them with grapefruit-scented items because it was one of the few smells she could still tolerate.</p><p>To Gabriel\u2019s delight, however, Julia\u2019s hormones were such that she wanted sex several times a day. He was happy to accommodate her.</p><p>(For in this respect, as in several others, he was the consummate gentleman.)</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Gabriel observed her face, which had taken on a greenish cast.</p> <p>She continued buttoning up her jeans. \u201cLook, Gabriel, they still fit.\u201d</p><p>He reached over to kiss her forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s great, darling. But we should probably start shopping for maternity clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to spend my anniversary shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to. But I thought we\u2019d spend some time walking around Copley Place before we check into the Plaza for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThat sounds good.\u201d</p><p>By the time she reached the kitchen her stomach had begun to roll. She eyed the platter of scrambled eggs on the breakfast table as Gabriel helped himself to a few strips of bacon.</p><p>She felt a funny sensation in the back of her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start with a slice of dry toast? That\u2019s what I used to do every morning.\u201d Rebecca picked up a loaf of bread and motioned toward the toaster.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel good,\u201d Julia announced, closing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI bought more ginger ale. Sit down and I\u2019ll get you one.\u201d Rebecca put the bread aside and moved toward the fridge.</p><p>Before Julia could respond, she felt her stomach heave. She covered her mouth and ran for the nearest bathroom.</p><p>Gabriel followed, the sounds of her retching echoing down the hall.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart.\u201d He crouched next to her, reaching around to lift her hair out of the way.</p><p>She was on her knees, head hanging over the toilet.</p><p>She vomited again and again, her stomach emptying.</p><p>Gabriel rubbed her back with his other hand. He fetched her a towel to wipe her mouth and a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cThis must be love,\u201d she murmured, in between sips of water.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He sat behind her, cradling her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou held my hair, Professor. You must love me.\u201d</p><p>He reached a tentative hand to her lower abdomen. \u201cI seem to recall you looking after me once, when I was sick. And that was before you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always loved you, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cWe made this little one together. You aren\u2019t going to scare me off with bodily fluids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that when my water breaks.\u201d</p><p>The Emersons spent a few hours leisurely walking around Copley Place before driving to an Italian restaurant in the north end for dinner.</p><p>That evening, in their suite at the Copley Plaza hotel, Julia undressed, dropping her clothes carelessly on the floor. Gabriel surveyed her body, his eyes fixing on her breasts, which were full and ripe.</p><p>\u201cYour beauty always takes my breath away.\u201d</p><p>Julia felt her skin heat under his gaze. \u201cYour compliments always surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t. Perhaps I don\u2019t say them often enough.\u201d He paused, staring at her. \u201cWe aren\u2019t newlyweds anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy anniversary, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy anniversary, Mr. Emerson.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his jacket pocket and removed a distinctive blue box, tied with a white satin ribbon.</p><p>Julia stammered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gabriel. I have a card for you but I forgot your gift back at the house.\u201d She rubbed at her forehead. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not getting pregnancy brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnancy brain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Rubio says it\u2019s common for pregnant women to experience short-term memory problems. It\u2019s probably due to hormones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a gift, but I\u2019m grateful you thought of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Star of David on a silver chain. I know you don\u2019t wear jewelry.\u201d She gestured to his wedding ring. \u201cExcept for that. But I thought maybe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d wear it. Thank you, Julianne, that was very thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot it. Thank you for your present.\u201d She gazed at him warmly as he handed her the box.</p><p>When she opened it, she found a diamond solitaire pendant suspended on a long platinum chain. She looked up at him quizzically.</p><p>\u201cIt matches Grace\u2019s earrings.\u201d He stood behind her, gesturing toward the necklace.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d She touched the stone as he fastened the chain around her neck. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for putting up with me,\u201d he whispered, kissing the place where her neck flared into her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a hardship. We have our ups and downs like any couple.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, taking her hand in his. \u201cLet\u2019s try to make sure our ups are greater than our downs.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d spent time loving one another, they curled together on the bed.</p><p>Julia fingered the necklace that rested just above her expanded breasts.</p><p>\u201cAre you scared?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The corners of Gabriel\u2019s lips turned up. \u201cTerrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you smiling?</p><p>\u201cBecause part of me is growing inside you. I get to see my beautiful wife carry my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a few months, we\u2019ll have a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already a family.\u201d He reached out to stroke her hair. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. I nearly fell asleep in one of my seminars this week. I\u2019m finding it difficult to stay awake in the afternoon without caffeine.\u201d</p><p>His expression grew concerned. \u201cYou need to get more rest. Maybe you should come home and take a nap before your seminars.\u201d</p><p>Julia yawned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to, but there isn\u2019t time. I just need to start going to bed early. Which means we\u2019ll need to have sex right after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so it begins,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with me.\u201d She pushed at him playfully and he grabbed her wrist, pulling her into a tender kiss.</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>Julia was surprised. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want someone I can spoil, like you. A little brown-eyed angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me. Until we find out the sex of the baby, I don\u2019t want to call the baby it. I know some people do that because there\u2019s no gender-neutral pronoun in English. But I don\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you talk about grammar. It\u2019s sexy.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cWe\u2019ll just call her her or the baby.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s hand drifted down to her abdomen. \u201cWhat makes you so sure the baby is a girl? I think we\u2019re having a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a she. And we\u2019ll have to come up with an appropriate name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as what? Beatrice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s only one Beatrice. We could call her Grace.\u201d</p><p>Julia was thoughtful for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to decide on a name, although Grace is a possibility. I think he\u2019s going to be a boy, though. So for now, we\u2019ll just have to call him Ralph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRalph? Why Ralph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good, all-purpose nickname. I would have called him Peanut, but that\u2019s what we called Tommy before he was born.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel chuckled. \u201cYour mind is fascinating. Now go to sleep, little mama. Morning comes very early these days.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead before turning out the light. Then he held his wife in his arms.</p><p>A few hours later, he awoke to the feel of a hand stroking his naked chest.</p><p>\u201cDarling?\u201d His voice was thick with sleep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I woke you.\u201d She moved closer, pressing her thigh in between his.</p><p>He felt her lips press light kisses over his pectorals and up to his neck.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her hand brushed over his abdominal muscles before descending lower.</p><p>She kissed him and he responded warmly. His sleepiness and fatigue seemed to melt away as she moved her hand up and down.</p><p>\u201cYou have something I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d His hand caught her wrist, pausing her movements.</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cJulianne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for waking you up, but I really need to have sex. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now. Please.\u201d</p><p>He removed his hand and threw back the bedclothes.</p><p>\u201cDo with me as you will.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, she moved to straddle him. He reached up to cup her heavy breasts as she leaned down to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cInvite me inside,\u201d he murmured, as he pressed up against her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you need an invitation?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stared into her eyes, which had widened with excitement.</p><p>\u201cI could spend the rest of my life inside you and die happy. You\u2019re my home.\u201d</p><p>Julia paused at the sudden vulnerability that flashed across her husband\u2019s face. She lifted her hands to cover his, pressing into her breasts.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make me cry. And I\u2019m emotional already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo tears, please.\u201d He squeezed her more tightly.</p><p>\u201cThen come,\u201d she whispered, bringing their hips into alignment.</p><p>He slowly entered her.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>Julia didn\u2019t try to blink back the tears. She let them fall.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>He responded by licking and sucking her breasts, teasing her and spurring her on. Within minutes they were pushing and pulling, their skin warm and alive with excitement.</p><p>\u201cIs it good?\u201d Gabriel ground out, his hands dropping to her hips.</p><p>Her eyes were closed, her rosy lips parted. When she didn\u2019t answer he placed a tender hand to her face. \u201cJulia?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d she panted. \u201cSo good.\u201d</p> <p>His large hands gripped her hips, urging her on.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Julia responded by lifting herself and quickly slamming down, over and over again, until they both collapsed from near exhaustion.</p><p>Chapter Seventy-three</p><p>January 31, 2012</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</p><p>Professor Katherine Picton stood in the lecture hall at Harvard, surveying the crowd. She\u2019d delivered her paper presentation a half hour after Professor Jeremy Martin offered his. And she\u2019d fielded questions from the audience and received a very smart paperweight as a gift from Professor Greg Matthews, on behalf of the Department of Romance Studies.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to greet the Emersons yet. She was eager to do so. They\u2019d invited her to their home for dinner so she could escape Greg\u2019s more experimental culinary choices.</p> <p>\u201cAh, there you are!\u201d Professor Picton\u2019s crisp British accent cut through the hum of a dozen or so conversations.</p><p>She strode quickly down one of the aisles, straight to where Julia was still seated, while Gabriel stood next to her, chatting amiably with Julia\u2019s supervisor, Professor Marinelli.</p><p>\u201cKatherine.\u201d Gabriel greeted her smoothly, kissing her cheek.</p><p>\u201cGabriel and Julianne. Good to see you both.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Professor Marinelli. \u201cCecilia, delightful to see you, as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d The two women embraced.</p><p>\u201cNow then, have you spoken with Jeremy?\u201d Katherine turned her blue-gray eyes on Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gabriel was terse.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s high time you two buried the hatchet. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia gazed between the two other Dante specialists and politely made her excuses, choosing to flee to another part of the room where an argument was not about to break forth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with Jeremy.\u201d Gabriel sounded offended. \u201cJeremy has a problem with me.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s eyes snapped.</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t mind if I bring him over here.\u201d</p><p>She marched her small figure up to Jeremy Martin and spoke to him rather directly.</p><p>Julia stood uneasily, wondering what was about to happen.</p><p>It was obvious that Professor Martin did not wish to speak with Gabriel. Julia watched as he looked in their direction, then looked back at Katherine, shaking his head.</p><p>Katherine appeared to scold him, but only for a moment, before the two professors walked in the direction of the Emersons.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Julia whispered, taking Gabriel\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cEmerson.\u201d Jeremy\u2019s voice was stiff, as he approached.</p><p>\u201cJeremy.\u201d</p><p>Katherine looked between the two men and frowned. \u201cWell, get on with it. Shake hands.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel released Julia\u2019s hand in order to shake the hand of his former friend.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, Jeremy, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked up at her husband in surprise.</p><p>Professor Martin appeared taken aback as well. He shifted his weight, his eyes traveling from Gabriel\u2019s to Julia\u2019s and back again.</p><p>\u201cI understand that congratulations are in order. You\u2019ve been married about a year, I think. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Julia interjected. \u201cThank you, Professor Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jeremy, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we owe you a debt. I won\u2019t forget it.\u201d Gabriel lowered his voice.</p><p>Jeremy stepped back.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps we could talk in the hall? Come on, Jeremy, we were friends for years. I\u2019m trying to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy grimaced. \u201cAll right. Ladies, excuse me.\u201d He nodded at Katherine and Julia before following Gabriel into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cThat went well.\u201d Julia turned to Katherine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. If they return without having spilt any blood, I\u2019ll agree with you.\u201d Katherine\u2019s eyes sparkled impishly. \u201cShall we watch through the door?\u201d</p><p>Over dinner at their home that evening, Gabriel and Julia were determined not to announce her pregnancy to Katherine. They\u2019d resolved not to tell anyone until she was in her second trimester.</p><p>(However, they did nothing to hide the telltale sign of the Volvo SUV that Gabriel had recently purchased, which was parked in the driveway.)</p><p>While Gabriel was in the kitchen making coffee, Katherine turned her all-seeing eyes on Julia and tapped a single finger on top of the linen tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Julia faltered, putting her water glass down so she wouldn\u2019t spill.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious. You aren\u2019t drinking. You declined coffee. Your husband, who by all accounts is very solicitous, is hovering over you as if you were made of china, while simultaneously trying to hide his extreme, testosterone-laden pride. You can\u2019t fool me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Picton, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d agreed you\u2019d call me Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine, I\u2019m not very far along. We aren\u2019t telling anyone, including family, until I\u2019m in my second trimester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wise. It might be good for you to put off telling your department until the last possible moment.\u201d Katherine sipped her wine thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to tell them.\u201d</p><p>Katherine put her glass down. \u201cCan you tell me why?\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s hand went to her abdomen. \u201cThere are several reasons. I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll think I\u2019m not serious enough and that Cecilia will drop me as a student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. Cecilia has three children, two of which she had while she was a graduate student in Pisa. Next problem.\u201d</p><p>Julia paused, her mouth open.</p><p>\u201cUm, I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known her for years. She\u2019s a working mother who is determined to carve out time for her family. That\u2019s why they spend their summers in Italy, so the children can be with their grandparents. Next problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll take away my funding and I\u2019ll lose my fellowship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUniversities are very different from when I was a student. There are legal issues that would prevent your department from doing that. You\u2019re entitled to a maternity leave just like everyone else. In fact, if I\u2019m not mistaken, Harvard has a committee on the status of women that would ensure you are treated fairly. Even if your department were chaired by a fool, and it isn\u2019t, he\u2019d have to follow the guidelines. Next problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking for a maternity leave. But I was told by my doctor I\u2019d need to take at least six weeks off after the baby is born. I\u2019m worried my chair will force me to deregister for the semester.\u201d</p><p>Katherine frowned. \u201cNot take a maternity leave? Are you mad?\u201d</p><p>Julia started to protest, but Katherine lifted an aged, wrinkled hand.</p><p>\u201cI might be an old maid, but I know you won\u2019t be able to do justice to your program, or your newborn, if you don\u2019t take a maternity leave. You are allowed one. You should take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t the department frown on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the old fossils might, but if you have the support of your supervisor, what does it matter? My advice is to speak to Cecilia and ask for her advice. She\u2019ll know best how to guide you. Don\u2019t let the misogynists drive you into an impossible situation.\u201d</p><p>Katherine tapped her chin thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m always eager to fight injustice. Let them try to injure you. In fact, I have half a mind to accept Greg Matthews\u2019s offer to join his department just to ensure that they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2019d consider that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to sell my house and leave Toronto. All Souls is eager to have me join them in Oxford on a more permanent basis, but the truth is there are only a few fellows in that college that I can tolerate. It\u2019s making my meals in college most unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be wonderful to have you at Harvard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think so, too.\u201d Katherine\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cThis is where all the action is. Greg promised me he\u2019d move my library personally. I want to accept his offer simply to see him hand-packing my books.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed at the thought of Professor Matthews, who was very distinguished, moving Professor Picton\u2019s extensive private library by hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you and Gabriel are having a baby. Whether I move to Harvard or not, I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll let me be the aged, eccentric godmother who purchases outrageous gifts and feeds the child things that aren\u2019t good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like nothing more.\u201d Julia squeezed Katherine\u2019s hand just as Gabriel returned with coffee.</p><p>He glanced between the two women. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Katherine lifted her wine glass, saluting him. \u201cI was just telling Julianne that I accept the distinguished appointment as your baby\u2019s godmother.\u201d</p><p>Just before bed, Julia asked Gabriel about his conversation with Professor Martin.</p><p>Gabriel stared up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cIt went better than expected, but I doubt he\u2019ll ever forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Julia rested her head on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I stabbed him and the entire department in the back. Although the fact that I married you seems to have ameliorated his low opinion of me. Perhaps once he learns we\u2019re pregnant, his anger will cool a little more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about him?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cHe was a friend. I\u2019m sorry we had a falling out, but I\u2019m not sorry for what I did. I\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p><p>Julia sighed. \u201cWell, the day wasn\u2019t a total loss. I enjoyed watching my fellow graduate students react to your arrival.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cOh, really? And how did they react?\u201d</p><p>Julia rolled onto her stomach. \u201cLike they\u2019d never seen a hot professor before. You made quite an impression in your turtleneck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, yes, the turtleneck. Turtles have that effect on people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the man they were admiring. And I was proud to be with you.\u201d She laced the edges of the sheet between her fingers. \u201cBut there are still rumors going around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Gabriel lifted her chin so he could make eye contact.</p><p>\u201cZsuzsa told me that some of the grad students have been saying that you got me into the program.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBastards,\u201d Gabriel spat. \u201cThis is Christa\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely. We made our choices and we have to live with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reality of what happened and what they\u2019re saying is poles apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But you\u2019ll be interested to know that now they\u2019re gossiping about Christa.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gazed at her with cautious interest. \u201cChrista? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSean, one of the PhD students in my department, has a friend at Columbia. He said that the department forced Christa out. None of the faculty would agree to supervise her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cReally? When I was in New York, Lucia mentioned that Katherine complained about Christa\u2019s behavior in Oxford. But I doubt her dismissal had anything to do with us. Lucia also said that her work wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible she didn\u2019t get along with the Dante specialists in that department. They can be mercurial.\u201d Julia winked at her husband slyly.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Gabriel sniffed.</p><p>\u201cSean said that Christa is on her way to do her PhD in Geneva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneva doesn\u2019t have its own doctoral program in Italian. They\u2019re part of a consortium.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where she\u2019s headed, if the rumors are to be believed.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cIf she\u2019d just focused on her work at Toronto and not become fixated on me, she\u2019d probably still be there. Her original application and writing sample were very good. It was her machinations that were her downfall. Then she made the colossal error of going up against Katherine. That made Lucia nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine is one of the best in her field. If anyone wants to publish in Dante studies, or write a grant for support, or try to get a job, people look to her for her opinion. If she approves of you, she\u2019ll say so. If she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019ll say that, too. No one wants to alienate her in case they need her support some day. That includes Lucia and her department.\u201d</p><p>Julia pursed her lips.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want Christa\u2019s life to be ruined. I just wanted her to leave us alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did this to herself. She had several opportunities to rethink her choices, and she didn\u2019t. No one made her go to Oxford and try to sabotage you, or to do mediocre work at Columbia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d Julia rested her head on the pillow. \u201cAcademia is the strangest place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBit like Mars, really. Except with more sex.\u201d</p><p>Julia laughed. \u201cI\u2019m glad Katherine approves of me. I shudder to think what would happen if she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. But in any case, I\u2019ll speak to Greg Matthews and make sure the rumors about us are quashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call in a favor for that. I might need his help with something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine thinks I need to take a maternity leave. She wants me to speak to Cecilia about it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stroked the arches of her eyebrows with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to Cecilia. But I was hoping to wait until I\u2019m in my second trimester. Most mis\u2014\u201d She caught Gabriel\u2019s eye and stumbled over the word. \u201c\u2014problems occur in the first trimester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to take a maternity leave, you should. If you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m going on leave regardless. After the paternity leave, they owe me a sabbatical. I could be home with the baby for two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there some rule about not taking a leave and a sabbatical back to back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Gabriel began caressing her lower back. \u201cBut I have it written into my contract that they give me a sabbatical the year after next. It was part of their job offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate to see you waste your sabbatical,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>His hand rested in the hollow of her lower back.</p><p>\u201cWhat part of spending time with the baby would be wasted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to finish your book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have time to write. Even if I didn\u2019t, it would be worth it. Talk to Cecilia and see what she says. But whatever you do, don\u2019t worry. I made promises to you, and I intend to keep them.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason why I\u2019m not freaking out.\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her intensely. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventy-four</p><p>April 2012</p><p>So, Julianne, what can I do for you?\u201d Cecilia Marinelli ushered her graduate student into her office, gesturing to a comfortable chair near the large desk.</p><p>Cecilia was just under five feet tall, with bobbed dark hair and blue eyes. She was from Pisa, originally, and spoke English with an accent.</p><p>\u201cI came to ask your advice.\u201d Julia began wringing her hands.</p><p>\u201cAsk.\u201d Cecilia gave Julia an encouraging look.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations! This is good news, yes?\u201d Cecilia switched to Italian, smiling widely.</p><p>Julia answered her in Italian. \u201cYes. Very good news. Uh, but I\u2019m due in September, right at the beginning of the semester.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia shrugged. \u201cThen you take maternity leave and return the next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fall behind in my program, so I\u2019m not going to take a maternity leave.\u201d</p><p>Professor Marinelli shook her head. \u201cThis is not the best idea. Normally, in your third year, you would teach in the fall and take your linguistics course plus another class. Then you would write your general exams in the winter. Since your baby comes in September, I think your teaching and coursework would have to be delayed until January. Then you will be studying for your exams at the same time. This is too much.\u201d Cecilia\u2019s tone was not unkind.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that.\u201d Julia\u2019s voice sounded shaky and small.</p><p>\u201cYou do what you like, but certainly, I would take maternity leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia sat back in her chair for a moment. \u201cIt will be too much for you to put all these things in one semester. Your colleagues will have the advantage of you in their general exams. And you cannot fail. So, to make things fair, you take maternity leave for one year. Then, you teach and take your classes the following September, and take your exams in the winter. Yes, you will be behind a year. But you are a good student. I think you will catch up when you are writing your dissertation. It will be better to be behind a year than to realize midsemester you cannot do everything.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s heart sank as all her plans fell to pieces. Frantically, she searched for another solution.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t some of the courses offered in the summer?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia noted her student\u2019s reaction and switched to English. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s hands twisted in her lap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that Gabriel was going to take a leave from BU so that I wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel? With a baby?\u201d Cecilia laughed, chattering to herself in Italian.</p><p>(Apparently, she found the thought of the Professor looking after a baby highly amusing. In this, she was not alone.)</p><p>\u201cThis, I did not expect. But it shows he will be a good father, yes? If he is willing to help. But Gabriel\u2019s leave doesn\u2019t solve the problem of the schedule. It isn\u2019t realistic to think you can have a baby, then return to class the next day. God forbid you have complications and need to take time off before the baby is born.\u201d</p><p>Julia winced. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that, either.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia smiled patiently. \u201cThis is why we have advisors, to offer advice and maybe a little caution. My advice is to take maternity leave. You won\u2019t lose your place in the program or your funding. If you want, I can give you a reading list for your dissertation prospectus and you can work on that while you\u2019re on leave. You could also work on your other languages. But let\u2019s not be too ambitious. And there\u2019s one more thing, but you must promise to keep it secret. Professor Matthews is waiting to make the formal announcement.\u201d She switched back into Italian, as if that language afforded them more privacy.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Julia responded in Italian, looking at her supervisor with interest.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Picton has decided to come to Harvard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Julia\u2019s heart leapt with joy.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. She\u2019s committed to stay in Oxford one more year, then she will arrive next September, when you return from maternity leave. I cannot speak for her, but I believe she would be a reader on your dissertation. This is very good news for your project.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled as the wheels began turning in her mind.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d said Cecilia, reverting to English once again. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you it will be easy, being a mother and a student. But you can do it. Please give Gabriel my congratulations. I\u2019m happy for you both.\u201d</p><p>Julia thanked her professor and exited the office.</p><p>When Julia arrived home for dinner, Gabriel was sitting on a bar stool at the kitchen island, reading the newspaper.</p><p>He immediately dropped the paper when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cWhy, hello, beautiful. How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was okay.\u201d Julia put her messenger bag down on the floor and sat next to him at the island.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He placed his hand at the back of her neck and gently pulled her close so he could kiss her. \u201cAre you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have good news and bad news.\u201d</p><p>The edges of his lips turned down. \u201cWhat\u2019s the bad news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Marinelli said I have to take a maternity leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did she say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the baby is due in September, she doesn\u2019t think I should register for courses in the fall. The way the schedule is, it would be too much if I tried to cram the third-year requirements into the winter semester. So she thinks I should just take the year off.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rubbed at his chin. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten about how busy the third year is. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do? I have to take a maternity leave.\u201d She put her elbows on the counter.</p><p>\u201cJulianne, you can do anything you want. If you want to take classes after the baby is born, we\u2019ll make it work. You\u2019ll just have to take incompletes while you catch up on what you\u2019ve missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe graduate school doesn\u2019t like students taking incompletes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. But they allow it, in certain circumstances. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d allow it in this case.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019d be playing catch-up while studying for my general exams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Just because Cecilia thinks it might be challenging doesn\u2019t mean it will be impossible. As I said before, I will make this work. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked up at him, at his warm and earnest expression. \u201cYou will make this work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But I\u2019m not going to tell you what to do. You decide and I\u2019ll speak to Greg, if necessary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll talk to him. But\u2014\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you the good news. Cecilia said that Katherine is coming to Harvard.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s mouth opened in astonishment. \u201cWhat? I had an email from her last week. She never mentioned anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, she\u2019s staying at Oxford next year and coming to Harvard the year after. That\u2019s another reason why Cecilia thinks that a maternity leave is a good idea\u2014Katherine will arrive when I come back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. But\u2014\u201d Julia shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take a maternity leave, but I\u2019m worried about failing my exams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be in tiptop shape either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll get you into tiptop shape. You\u2019re going to have Rebecca and me here to hold the fort. You can study for your exams and do what you need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be a mother, too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ignore the baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can find a balance.\u201d He kissed the top of her head before crossing over to the refrigerator. He retrieved a bottle of ginger ale and quickly poured it over ice in a tall glass.</p><p>He handed it to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to decide right now. Register for the fall and if you feel like you need to drop the courses or take incompletes, you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to start something and not finish it. I certainly don\u2019t want to risk failing my exams.\u201d She looked up at Gabriel, a worried expression on her face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an absent mother, like Sharon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be like her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked down at the marble-topped island and traced a pattern on its surface.</p><p>\u201cTruthfully, I don\u2019t know what to expect when we have the baby. But as I said, I\u2019m taking leave regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCecilia mentioned that she could give me a reading list for my dissertation prospectus. I could work on that while I\u2019m on leave, along with my languages.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure the baby will be delighted to learn about Dante and also to be able to do more than just curse in German.\u201d</p> <p>Julia laughed and wrapped an arm around his waist. \u201cI think I\u2019d be missing out if I didn\u2019t take part of a maternity leave. Who knows what kind of mischief you and the baby will get into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you can be sure we will get into all kinds of mischief.\u201d He winked. \u201cAnd there is a strong possibility that shenanigans and hijinks of various sorts will also occur, with regularity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you and the baby will need me.\u201d Julia glanced at him.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes locked on hers.</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ll need you. But I\u2019ll make it work if you can\u2019t be here.\u201d He brought the backs of his fingers to her face and gently stroked her cheek. \u201cIf you take maternity leave, we could spend part of the year in Umbria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Oxford, or Paris, or Barcelona. You name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelinsgrove?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pulled back. \u201cOf all the cities in the world, you want to go there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where your family home is. That\u2019s where my family is. It might be nice to be close to Diane. She could give me advice and we could schedule play dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk to her on FaceTime from Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe orchard is there.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel traced his thumb across Julia\u2019s lower lip and sighed. \u201cYes, the orchard is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into registering for the fall and if I can\u2019t go back after the baby is born, I\u2019ll drop the classes. Then I\u2019ll go on maternity leave for the winter semester and start studying for my general exams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a good plan. Katherine will be here by the following September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can have the baby at Mount Auburn Hospital, and decide from there where we want to go. I\u2019m not sure about taking a newborn on a transatlantic flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I hadn\u2019t thought about that.\u201d</p><p>Julia wrapped her arms around his waist. \u201cWe haven\u2019t thought of a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I have a book.\u201d Gabriel reached over to pick up a copy of What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting that was sitting nearby.</p><p>\u201cMake sure to mark the place where it talks about transatlantic flights and the likelihood of writing a book on Dante\u2019s concept of Hell while caring for a baby. I\u2019d be interested in reading those sections.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the book aside. \u201cVery funny, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d</p><p>She pressed herself against him. \u201cIf we go to Europe, we\u2019ll be able to visit some museums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to tango against the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to bring Rebecca with us if we ever want to have a tango in a museum again.\u201d He pressed an openmouthed kiss to her neck.</p><p>\u201cMuseums aren\u2019t as accommodating as they used to be.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shone.</p><p>\u201cExcept for our last visit to the Uffizi.\u201d</p><p>Now she was blushing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want for our next anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? A museum?\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Another tango against a wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we try the Louvre next time?\u201d</p><p>Julia felt her insides flame. \u201cThat sounds promising.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her neck, fluttering his lips against her skin. \u201cWe have a lot of good things to look forward to, Mrs. Emerson. But I think we both need to read that book.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventy-five</p><p>Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania</p><p>You\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>A pile of silverware slid from Rachel\u2019s fingers, clattering onto the kitchen island. She stared openmouthed at her best friend.</p><p>Gabriel had his arm around Julia as they stood in the kitchen of the Clark family home. Scott, Tammy, and Quinn sat on stools nearby, while Richard and Aaron were deep in conversation near the stove.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d Julia repeated, her eyes searching Rachel\u2019s face.</p><p>The room fell silent.</p><p>\u201cBut, but, I didn\u2019t know you were trying. I thought you were going to wait,\u201d Rachel sputtered.</p><p>\u201cThe news was unexpected but not unwelcome.\u201d Gabriel pressed his lips to Julia\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news, Julia. When are you due?\u201d Tammy interjected.</p><p>\u201cSeptember.\u201d Julia\u2019s hand curved over her slightly protruding abdomen. \u201cWe told Dad, Diane, and my uncle Jack last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this calls for cigars. I\u2019m very proud of you both.\u201d Richard shook Gabriel\u2019s hand and clapped him on the back before kissing Julia\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt will be nice to have another baby around. Quinn and Tommy will have a new playmate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Tammy followed, hugging Julia, and so did Scott.</p><p>Julia looked over at her best friend apprehensively. \u201cRach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Rachel suddenly closed her mouth. She looked as if she were about to burst into tears.</p><p>Aaron wrapped an arm around her shoulders. He murmured something in her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you,\u201d Rachel managed. After a moment, she embraced Julia and Gabriel together. \u201cI am. I\u2019m happy for you both.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes began to water.</p><p>\u201cI think we should give the girls a minute. Isn\u2019t there a game on?\u201d Aaron jerked his thumb toward the living room, where the wide-screen television was located.</p><p>Tammy, Quinn, and the men quickly retreated, leaving the best friends alone.</p><p>\u201cThis is a surprise.\u201d Rachel sat on one of the bar stools. \u201cWas it an accident?\u201d</p><p>Julia chewed at the inside of her mouth. \u201cGabriel doesn\u2019t want us using the word accident. He doesn\u2019t want the baby growing up thinking he wasn\u2019t wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Rachel appeared horrified. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it that way. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, uh, clearly this was unexpected, because we were planning on waiting.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s eyes trained on her friend\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been a shock for you. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was upset at the beginning, but Gabriel has been great. He\u2019s really excited and his enthusiasm is infectious. Rebecca moved in with us, so she\u2019ll help with the baby. I\u2019ve decided to take a maternity leave, and Gabriel is going to do the same.\u201d</p><p>Rachel snorted, resting her forearm on the top of the island. \u201cGabriel is taking a maternity leave? I\u2019ll believe that when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a paternity leave. It\u2019s available to him and so he\u2019s going to take it. They owe him a sabbatical anyway, but he\u2019s deferring it.\u201d Julia sat on the stool to Rachel\u2019s left. \u201cWe\u2019re even talking about moving here for part of the year, after the baby is born.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s gray eyes grew soft. \u201cDad would love that. Have you told him?\u201d</p><p>Julia shook her head. \u201cWe were waiting until we told everyone we were expecting.\u201d She glanced in the direction of the living room. \u201cGabriel is probably asking him right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad won\u2019t say no. Will Rebecca come too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far ahead. But it would be a bit ridiculous for one little baby to require three adults to supervise him.\u201d</p><p>Rachel regarded her friend. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been around babies much, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might need Rebecca to keep up the house and to cook for everyone.\u201d Rachel stared at her fingernails. \u201cYou and Diane will be able to commiserate about motherhood. We\u2019ll come home for weekends. The baby will be surrounded by family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we wanted. I\u2019m sorry about the timing. I know you and Aaron have been trying and I feel so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Rachel forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you. And I\u2019m going to be the best damn aunt I can be. I\u2019m hoping, someday, you\u2019ll have the chance to be the same to mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled, a sympathetic sadness twisting in her insides.</p><p>That evening, Aaron stood in his wife\u2019s childhood bedroom, which was still decorated with the awards and trophies she\u2019d won in high school. He held her in his arms as she sobbed into his chest.</p><p>He felt helpless. He felt impotent.</p><p>\u201cRach,\u201d he whispered, rubbing her back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so unfair,\u201d she managed, her hands fisting his shirt. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even want a baby! Jules was going to wait until she graduated. I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aaron didn\u2019t know what to say. When Julia announced her good news, he was envious, but not to the degree that Rachel was. After a year of trying to conceive, she was battling depression. He didn\u2019t want to feed it by focusing on the unfairness of life and raising existential questions that might never be answered.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re upset, but I need you to calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my mom.\u201d She pressed her forehead into his shoulder. \u201cShe would know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I loved your mother, she wasn\u2019t a miracle worker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut she could give me advice. And I\u2019m never going to see her again.\u201d A fresh round of sobs escaped Rachel\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true,\u201d he whispered, rubbing her back once again. \u201cThis was a shock, but we have to get over it. People around us are going to have children. You don\u2019t want this to come between you and Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl. So no tears tomorrow.\u201d He pulled away, his face marked with concern.</p><p>\u201cI can do that. I gave an Academy Award\u2013winning performance earlier. I wanted to cry as soon as she told me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to act, Rachel. I want you to appear to be okay and I want that to be the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not okay.\u201d She sat on the edge of her bed.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you about that.\u201d Aaron joined her on the bed. \u201cInstead of focusing on what we don\u2019t have, I\u2019d like us to start thinking about what we have. We have our jobs, we have a nice place to live, we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have fertility treatments that aren\u2019t working.\u201d Rachel cursed under her breath.</p><p>\u201cThere are other options. We\u2019ve discussed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to give up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to give up. But maybe we should just relax for a while. Take a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a break?\u201d She peered over at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cStop the fertility treatments and forget about having a baby. Just for a while.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms around her middle. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his. \u201cI think the pressure is getting to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, you can\u2019t. I know you like I know myself. And I\u2019m telling you, you need a break. We need a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to try the fertility treatments for a year. We can\u2019t stop now.\u201d Her chin began to wobble.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we can.\u201d He brushed his lips across hers. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to the doctor when we\u2019re back in Philadelphia. Then we\u2019re going to take a long vacation. Gabriel promised he\u2019d lend us their house in Italy. We can take some time and just be a normal couple again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if this is it? What if we can\u2019t . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say it.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll start looking at other options.\u201d He placed his arm around her. \u201cWhether or not we have a baby, we have each other. That\u2019s something, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe need to take care of each other. And I\u2019m not taking care of you if I let you continue like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like a failure.\u201d Rachel wiped her face with the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re the most incredible woman I\u2019ve ever met. I would love to have a family with you but not if that journey is going to break you. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want kids that much.\u201d</p><p>Rachel looked at him, surprised. \u201cI thought this was important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou come first. You\u2019ve always come first.\u201d He squeezed her shoulder. \u201cI want the woman I married. Once we get back to that, then we can start talking about kids again. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Rachel was silent as she contemplated what he was proposing. She closed her eyes, and it felt as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders.</p><p>Suddenly, she felt as if she could breathe again.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Aaron pulled his wife into his arms. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Down the hall, Julia leaned her hip against the bathroom vanity, watching Gabriel brush his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYour father is proud of us for having a baby.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded, as he continued brushing.</p><p>\u201cThat means he\u2019s proud of us for having sex and you for impregnating me. Do you think they make T-shirts for grandfathers that express those sentiments?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel made a strangled choking noise before he began spitting into the sink.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d She tapped on his back. \u201cCan you speak?\u201d</p><p>He responded with more spitting and then raucous laughter.</p><p>\u201cT-shirts,\u201d he managed, placing his hand on the counter to support himself. \u201cHow do you come up with this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me who said it. I don\u2019t think anyone has ever told me that he\u2019s proud of me for having sex. My dad was happy for us, but he didn\u2019t say he was proud.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel deposited his toothbrush in the holder before straightening.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d Julia smiled to herself. \u201cUncle Jack seemed happy, when I told him. But he was acting weird on the telephone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe congratulated me, but he also gave me a lecture.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout my need to protect myself and the baby. I assured him I was doing so and then he asked me what you were doing to protect us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you were very attentive and that you were coming with me to all my appointments. He muttered something about that not being enough.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel frowned. \u201cDid you respond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him what he was worried about, but he kind of clammed up on me. Do you think something is up with Simon and Natalie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. If something were in the works, he\u2019d tell us about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Julia shook her head. \u201cHe promised me he\u2019d keep an eye on us, and I told him I\u2019d welcome whatever help he could give us. It was a very strange conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour uncle Jack is a strange person. Maybe he\u2019s decided to beat up Greg Matthews in order to ensure that you get a maternity leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor Matthews already authorized it. I don\u2019t need Uncle Jack\u2019s help with that.\u201d She smiled and exited the bathroom.</p><p>She stood by the window, looking out into the starless night.</p><p>Gabriel could see the outline of her body through her old-fashioned linen nightshirt: her long slim legs, her rounded hips and bottom. He switched off the lights and stood behind her, his talented fingers lifting and toying with her hair.</p><p>\u201cYour conversation with my sister was difficult, but she took the news well, I thought.\u201d He linked their hands together, bringing their connection to rest over where their child was growing.</p><p>\u201cShe and Aaron have been trying for so long and we weren\u2019t and boom! We\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel chuckled and rested his chin on her shoulder. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite like that. There was divine intervention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d His body tightened.</p><p>\u201cI do, I just feel guilty. It seems unfair,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we need to do a better job of supporting them. I\u2019m sure this is hard on both of them.\u201d He kissed the nape of her neck, pressing his chest to her back. \u201cDid you ever tell her how we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was too precious and too painful to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d He pressed her.</p><p>\u201cI like the fact that it\u2019s our secret. Your family is wonderful, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d understand. My father would come after you with a shotgun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>He began to drag his fingertips over her scalp, touching her gently, when she suddenly flinched.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI forgot about your scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You only startled me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel began to caress her again, this time avoiding the stretch of raised skin beneath her hair.</p><p>\u201cSharon could be nice sometimes, when she wasn\u2019t drinking and she was between boyfriends.\u201d Julia swallowed hard. \u201cShe would take me to the zoo and we\u2019d have picnics. She let me play dress-up with her clothes and she\u2019d do my hair. I liked that.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stilled his hand, pausing thoughtfully before speaking. \u201cI remember some good things about my mother, too. I\u2019m sorry Sharon hurt you. I wish I could take it all away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder why Sharon was nice to me at all if she was just going to turn around and be abusive again.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel continued toying with her hair. \u201cI understand. The cycle of abuse interspersed with occasional bouts of kindness keeps you stuck, waiting and hoping for the kindness to return. And it does, on occasion, only to be swept away. I know all about that. Regrettably.\u201d</p><p>Julia turned to face him. \u201cWe\u2019ve overcome a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with Simon doesn\u2019t haunt me anymore. Not like it did. I feel as if I\u2019ve moved past that.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cursed under his breath. \u201cThat motherfucker is lucky he has a powerful family. I still wish I could beat him senseless and teach his girlfriend a lesson. Your uncle Jack didn\u2019t want us to let them off the hook.\u201d</p><p>Julia placed a hand on his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s over now. Simon is getting married, and Jack said that Natalie moved to California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe farther away the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be a great mother, but I certainly have an idea of what I shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel touched her abdomen through her nightshirt.</p><p>\u201cPart of being a good parent is being a good person. And Julianne, you are the best person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her softly.</p><p>\u201cStanding in this house, I can\u2019t help but remember what life was like with my parents. We can have a home like theirs. A home filled with love and happiness. We\u2019ve had so much grace lavished on us . . .\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just relieved I don\u2019t have to do this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel took her hand and led her to the bed.</p><p>Chapter Seventy-six</p><p>Durham, North Carolina</p><p>April Hudson breezed into her apartment building Monday afternoon, stopping to check her mailbox. She\u2019d just returned from a romantic weekend in the Hamptons with her fianc\u00e9, Simon Talbot.</p><p>She sighed as she thought about him. He was tall, blond, and handsome. He was smart and from a good family. And the things he could do with his body . . .</p><p>The Hamptons were a sentimental favorite. It was where she\u2019d given him her virginity. It was where he\u2019d asked her to marry him.</p><p>(Not, of course, in the same weekend.)</p><p>As she shuffled through her mail, her mind was a happy whirl of wedding plans and memories from the weekend. He treated her well. And she no longer had to feel guilty about sleeping with him, because they were getting married. She was going to wake up with him every morning, forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>(Because her thoughts were so engaged, she didn\u2019t notice the ex-Marine from Philadelphia who was sitting in a dark car across the street, watching to see if she\u2019d open his letter. She certainly didn\u2019t know that he was ensuring that no one would trouble his niece and her unborn child.)</p><p>At the bottom of her mailbox, she found a manila envelope. It had her name on it, but no address or stamp. Puzzled, she gathered her mail and took the elevator to the third floor. Once she\u2019d entered her apartment and locked the door behind her, she abandoned her luggage and flopped onto the couch.</p><p>She opened the manila envelope first and was stunned to find that it contained a stack of large black-and-white photographs. They were all date-stamped September 27, 2011.</p><p>A strange buzzing filled her ears. As did the sound of her keys falling from her hand and crashing onto the hardwood floor.</p> <p>Leafing through the photos, she saw two naked bodies entwined on a bed. The identity of the man was unmistakable. So was his body, his positions, his technique.</p><p>But the woman he was with didn\u2019t look like a woman. She looked young, like a teenager.</p><p>And the things they were doing . . .</p><p>April covered her face with her hands, a cry of anguish escaping her lips.</p><p>Chapter Seventy-seven</p> <p>Washington, D.C.</p><p>That evening, Simon Talbot knocked on the door to his father\u2019s office in their family home in Georgetown. He\u2019d been summoned by Robert, his father\u2019s campaign manager, and ordered to return home immediately.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what was so urgent. That morning, he\u2019d said good-bye to April at the airport after enjoying a quiet but sexually charged weekend. He intended to surprise her the following weekend by flying down to Durham. Soon her semester would be over and he\u2019d help her pack her things and move her life to his apartment in Washington, where she belonged.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d the senator called.</p><p>Simon opened the door and walked toward the chair that was placed in front of the senator\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother sitting. This won\u2019t take long.\u201d As usual, the senator was gruff and to the point.</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen these?\u201d He tossed a stack of photographs onto the desk. They fanned out into a random pattern.</p><p>Simon looked at the picture nearest him. Snatching it up, he stared at it. His face grew pale.</p><p>\u201cWell? Have you seen them?\u201d The senator raised his voice, angrily thumping on the desk with his fist.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Simon slowly placed the photograph back on the desk, as the feeling of fear pricked the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me! Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Simon felt his chest tighten. He was having difficulty breathing.</p> <p>\u201cDid you take these pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad. I swear. I have no idea who took them.\u201d</p><p>His father cursed.</p><p>\u201cThese are just copies. Do you know how I got them?\u201d</p><p>Simon shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSenator Hudson. Someone sent the originals to your fianc\u00e9e. She told her father about them and he had copies made, which he delivered to me.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s chest grew even tighter.</p><p>\u201cApril saw them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She was hysterical. Her mother flew down to Durham to be with her. She had to take her to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she all right? What hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus on the problem, boy, for God\u2019s sake! Do you have any idea what this means for my campaign?\u201d</p><p>Simon clenched his fists. \u201cForget about your campaign for a minute. Did April try to hurt herself? What hospital is she in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky the Hudsons have no interest in blackmail. They simply want you to leave their daughter alone. The wedding is off, obviously. They\u2019re going to make the announcement tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Simon pulled out his cell phone and hit a button. He held the phone to his ear, but within seconds, he received a recorded message indicating that April\u2019s cell phone number was no longer in service.</p><p>\u201cDad, I can explain. Let me talk to April. It isn\u2019t what she thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d his father barked. \u201cRobert recognized the girl in the pictures. She was a high school student who interned in my office. Do you understand the damage you\u2019ve done? How could you be so stupid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened over a year ago. The date is wrong. I swear I wasn\u2019t fucking around on April. I love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love her,\u201d his father scoffed. \u201cYou had that red-headed whore on the side all the time.\u201d</p><p>Simon took a step forward. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I broke things off with her. I\u2019m telling you, April is different.\u201d</p><p>The senator waved his hand as if he were swatting a fly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late. She doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you. And who could blame her? The girl in the photos was seventeen, she was working for me, you slept with her, and you encouraged her to drink and use drugs. And it\u2019s all in God damned black and white!\u201d The senator swiped across his desk, sending the photos, pens, and papers flying into the air.</p><p>\u201cDad, I swear I can fix this. Just let me talk to April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The senator rose to his feet, glaring at his son. \u201cThe Hudsons want you to leave her alone, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Dad, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what you\u2019re told for once!\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>Simon stood, but only for a moment before picking up a bronze statue of a horseman that his father kept on his desk and hurling it against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou never listen!\u201d he shouted. \u201cMy whole life, you give orders, you talk, but you never fucking listen. So fuck you. Fuck your campaign and fuck the family. The only thing I\u2019ve ever cared about is her. And I\u2019m not going to lose her.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he strode out of the office, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>It was, Simon thought, the bitterest irony, as he sat in a police station in Durham.</p><p>(Unlike Gabriel, Simon did not know the actual meaning of the term irony.)</p><p>He\u2019d tried repeatedly to see April, but with no success. He sent flowers and letters, but they were refused. He tried emailing her, but she\u2019d blocked his email address.</p><p>He\u2019d attempted to wait for her outside her apartment and had been arrested. Now he was sitting in a police station awaiting news of whether he would be charged. He didn\u2019t have a lawyer, and he knew his father wouldn\u2019t help him.</p><p>He\u2019d deserved his last arrest\u2014when he\u2019d assaulted Julia. He\u2019d been angry and looking to even the score between them. But with April, he\u2019d acted out of love. He could only hope that if he accepted his arrest and pleaded guilty, perhaps he\u2019d have the opportunity to make amends. Perhaps she, or her mother, who was a kind, sympathetic woman, would give him five minutes to explain.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know who took the pictures. Natalie had not been a party to that particular encounter, although she was familiar with the hotel room in which it occurred. It was possible she\u2019d hired someone to film him.</p><p>It was obvious that Natalie had sent the pictures to April. She was the only one who stood to gain by breaking them up. And in one calculated act, she\u2019d hurt him, April, and his father\u2019s campaign. And she was enough of a vindictive bitch to want to do so.</p><p>So while Simon was biding his time waiting for an opportunity to make amends with April, he was going to take a trip out to Sacramento and pay Natalie a visit.</p><p>Those were the plans that formed in Simon\u2019s mind as he waited to find out his legal fate. He had no idea that Jack Mitchell was sitting in his dark Oldsmobile outside the police station, thinking of his pregnant niece, and smiling.</p><p>Chapter Seventy-eight</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</p><p>Once Julia\u2019s morning sickness subsided, she developed a strange fixation on Thai food. There was a restaurant near her old apartment in Cambridge that she favored, insisting it was the only place that satisfied her craving. Consequently, Gabriel or Rebecca ordered takeout from that restaurant almost daily.</p><p>Given her food intake, at one point Gabriel surmised that seventy-five percent of her body mass (and the baby\u2019s) was composed of spring rolls. So the child was no longer called Ralph. Gabriel, Rebecca, and eventually Julia referred to him as Spring Roll.</p><p>At the end of April, the Emersons visited Mount Auburn Hospital in order to have another ultrasound. They hoped that the picture would be clear enough to reveal the sex of the baby.</p><p>\u201cSpring Roll is a boy,\u201d Julia whispered, trying to ignore the pain of her overfull bladder.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gabriel grinned. \u201cTrust me. I know women. This baby is definitely a girl.\u201d</p><p>Julia couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>The technician called her name. Julia squeezed Gabriel\u2019s hand before following the technician into the ultrasound suite.</p><p>(At this juncture, Gabriel knew better than to argue with the technician about accompanying his wife.)</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know the sex of the baby?\u201d the technician asked as she placed a gown on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. My husband is waiting and I know he\u2019d like to find out, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll let you get changed and be right with you. My name is Amelia.\u201d The technician smiled and left Julia to change into the gown.</p><p>In a few minutes, Julia\u2019s rounded abdomen was covered with a warmed but sticky gel, and the ultrasound began. She couldn\u2019t help but stare at the computer screen, watching image after image of her baby.</p><p>Truthfully, she couldn\u2019t make out much other than the head and the body. Poor Spring Roll looked like an alien.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in luck,\u201d said Amelia, pressing a few buttons to capture some images. \u201cYour baby is in the right position so I can have a good look.\u201d</p><p>Julia heaved a sigh of relief. She was excited but nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just capture a few more images and then we can call your husband. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Amelia went to fetch Gabriel. When he entered the room, he strode to Julia\u2019s side immediately and took her hand, kissing it.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d He turned to Amelia, who was sitting at her computer screen once again.</p><p>She pointed to the screen. \u201cYour baby is developing well. Everything looks good. Congratulations, you\u2019re having a girl.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face split into a wide, happy smile.</p><p>Julia\u2019s eyes filled with tears. She cupped her hand over her mouth in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI told you, Mama. I know women.\u201d He kissed Julia\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a girl,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cIs that all right?\u201d His sapphire eyes darkened in concern.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Gabriel made copies of the ultrasound snapshots and immediately had them professionally framed, but he resisted the urge to display them outside their bedroom and study.</p><p>\u201cNow that we know that Spring Roll is a girl, we should probably think about setting up her room.\u201d Gabriel kept his eyes on the road as he drove the Volvo one Saturday in May. \u201cWe should also talk about names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should think about what you want and we can go shopping.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia turned to look at him. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d take you to lunch, and we can do that. But afterward, we need to start thinking about Spring Roll\u2019s room. We want it to be attractive, but functional. Something comfortable for you and for her, but not juvenile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a baby, Gabriel. Her stuff is going to be juvenile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. I want it to be elegant and not look like a preschool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood grief.\u201d Julia fought a grin as she began imagining what the Professor would design.</p><p>(Argyle patterns, dark wood, and chocolate brown leather immediately came to mind.)</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI might have done some searching on the Internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? From where? Restoration Hardware?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He bristled. \u201cTheir things wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for a baby\u2019s room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo where then?\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her triumphantly. \u201cPottery Barn Kids.\u201d</p><p>Julia groaned. \u201cWe\u2019ve become yuppies.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stared at her in mock horror. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re driving a Volvo and talking about shopping at Pottery Barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, Volvos have an excellent safety rating and they\u2019re more attractive than a minivan. Secondly, Pottery Barn\u2019s furniture happens to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. I\u2019d like to take you to one of their stores so you can see for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs long as we get Thai food first.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Gabriel\u2019s turn to roll his eyes. \u201cFine. But we\u2019re ordering takeout and taking it to the park for a picnic. And I\u2019m having Indian food, instead. If I see another plate of pad Thai, I\u2019m going to lose it.\u201d</p><p>Julia burst into peals of laughter.</p><p>Late that night, Gabriel retired to the master bedroom after a long evening spent putting together a wish list for the nursery. Some of the items he was going to place on a gift registry, since his sisters (Kelly and Rachel), Diane, Cecilia, and Katherine had all demanded that he and Julia register for baby gifts.</p><p>Gabriel had no idea parents did such a thing and found himself intrigued by the concept.</p><p>(He was distressed to learn that the Pottery Barn Kids gift registry did not extend to children\u2019s books in Italian or Yiddish.)</p><p>As he walked past the bed toward the bathroom, he noticed that Julia\u2019s feet were peeking out from under the duvet. The rest of her body was covered.</p><p>He smiled and reached over to pull the duvet over her feet.</p> <p>Chapter Seventy-nine</p><p>May 2012</p><p>Sacramento, California</p><p>Natalie Lundy went about her daily life with a spring in her step. Simon and April had had a very public breakup, he\u2019d been disowned by his family, and Senator Talbot\u2019s campaign was in shambles.</p><p>In short, she had no reason to jeopardize her new job by telling compromising tales to the tabloids. Someone had done the work for her\u2014probably a jealous ex-lover of Simon\u2019s or a political opponent of his father\u2019s.</p><p>Natalie was blissfully unaware of Simon\u2019s plans for revenge. Or the fact that he\u2019d abandoned those plans when April elected not to press charges against him. Natalie heard rumors that he was trying to win April back, but public opinion was such that she thought that outcome was more than unlikely.</p><p>Certainly, Natalie and Simon had no idea of Jack Mitchell\u2019s involvement, which meant that he slept well at night, secure in the knowledge that he\u2019d done what he needed to do in order to protect his pregnant niece.</p><p>Chapter Eighty</p><p>July 2012</p><p>Boston, Massachusetts</p><p>I\u2019m not sure this is a good idea.\u201d Julia hesitated outside the Agent Provocateur boutique on Newbury Street.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Gabriel gripped her hand.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a maternity store. They won\u2019t have anything that fits me.\u201d Her cheeks colored.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already spoken with Patricia. She knows we\u2019re coming.\u201d He smiled down at his pregnant wife. \u201cIn fact, I made a few requests.\u201d</p><p>Julia recognized the name of the boutique\u2019s manager, as they\u2019d met once before. Gabriel was not the sort of man who was embarrassed by women\u2019s underthings. In fact, he preferred to choose them himself, at least for special occasions.</p><p>This was a special occasion. As her pregnancy progressed, Julia was uncomfortable sleeping naked. Since none of her sexy lingerie fit her anymore, she\u2019d taken to wearing yoga pants and T-shirts to bed. For Gabriel, this was not a welcome change.</p><p>So of course, he did something about it.</p><p>Patricia greeted them warmly and ushered them to a private dressing room in which she\u2019d placed a rack of nightgowns, underwear, and robes.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d She gestured to the house telephone that was placed on a table nearby before closing the door behind her.</p><p>Julia fingered the transparent black chiffon of a babydoll nightgown as Gabriel watched her, the way a cat watches a mouse.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this.\u201d She glanced at the large trifold mirror balefully.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just us. Look, Patricia provided us with drinks.\u201d He placed a few ice cubes in a glass and poured some ginger ale over them.</p><p>She took the drink gratefully. \u201cThis is not a good day for me. I feel like a cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not a cow,\u201d Gabriel clipped. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant. And beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She avoided his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t stand in front of that mirror. I\u2019ll look like a bus\u2014from three different directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d He took the drink out of her hand, placing it on the low table nearby. \u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said take off your clothes.\u201d</p><p>She backed away from him. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he whispered, stepping closer.</p><p>She looked up at him. His blue eyes were warm, but he looked very determined.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to make me cry?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m trying to help you see what I see when I look at you.\u201d He beckoned to her and she moved to him.</p><p>He placed his hand on her shoulders and kissed her forehead. \u201cPick something you think is pretty and try it on. I\u2019ll sit over there with my back turned while you change. If you don\u2019t like anything here, we\u2019ll go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Julia leaned against him for a moment and he took her weight, stroking her sides up and down.</p><p>She sighed and picked a few satin hangers, carrying them to the far corner, where there was a series of hooks on the wall.</p><p>Gabriel smiled as he sat in a leather club chair, which was positioned a few feet away, facing the mirror. He made sure to keep his back to her while she undressed, not wanting to upset her.</p><p>He helped himself to some Perrier and began eyeing the clothes rack. In deference to Julia\u2019s modesty, he hadn\u2019t requested the more provocative items\u2014items that lacked coverage over the breasts, for example. The point of this exercise was to purchase things that made her feel confident and sexy, not self-conscious and cold.</p><p>Although some of his choices might push her boundaries, he wasn\u2019t interested in upsetting her. This was supposed to be fun and, he hoped, inspirational.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little tight,\u201d she called to him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be tight. Come over where I can see you.\u201d He kept his eyes fixed on the mirror, almost breathless in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cI think I need a larger size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave Patricia your measurements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d She almost shrieked. \u201cBut I\u2019m massive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulianne.\u201d His tone was commanding. \u201cCome\u2014here.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and walked toward the mirror.</p><p>Gabriel felt his heart stutter in his chest.</p><p>Julia stood wearing a Syble babydoll, which was black chiffon and embroidered with small pink flowers. She\u2019d kept on her black maternity panties but had added a pair of black seamed stockings, pulled up just to below her baby bump.</p><p>\u201cBreathtaking,\u201d he said.</p><p>She stood to the side of the mirror, her hand traveling between the panels of black chiffon to her stomach. Then she turned around slowly, checking her backside.</p><p>\u201cYou look perfect.\u201d</p><p>She caught his eyes in the mirror.</p><p>He could no longer sit. He moved to stand behind her but resisted the urge to touch.</p><p>He knew that if he gave in, he\u2019d have her in the dressing room in the leather club chair and their shopping trip would be over. Surely he could wait a few minutes while she tantalized him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked, his voice gruff.</p><p>\u201cI like it. I still think it\u2019s a little tight.\u201d She tugged at the straps, exposing more of her large breasts.</p><p>He moved his hands to fit over them and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cIt fits you like a glove. You have a beautiful figure.\u201d</p><p>A soft look came into her eyes. \u201cYou really think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He caressed her breasts through the fabric, passing his thumbs ever so gently over her sensitive nipples.</p><p>Her lips parted as she watched him touch her, feeling the sensations tingle across her flesh while seeing the hunger in his eyes.</p><p>Here was a man hopelessly aroused and eager, plying his seductive trade.</p><p>Gabriel brushed her hair aside and brought his lips to her ear. \u201cJust think how I\u2019ll make you feel when I remove it.\u201d</p><p>Throwing caution aside, he placed his lips to her neck, his tongue darting out to taste her skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting hot in here.\u201d She closed her eyes, leaning into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting started.\u201d He pressed himself against the curve of her backside so that she could feel his prominent arousal. \u201cI think we can agree that we\u2019ll take what you\u2019re wearing. Now choose something else.\u201d</p><p>She turned to kiss him, reaching up to tangle her fingers in his hair. She kissed him until they were almost ready to forgo shopping before returning to the clothes rack.</p><p>Gabriel walked to a nearby table and lifted the house phone.</p><p>\u201cPatricia? We\u2019re going to need more ice.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighty-one</p><p>August 2012</p><p>Near Burlington, Vermont</p><p>As the winter months passed, Paul spent more and more time with Allison. They went to dinner and to the movies. They flirted via email and text message. And his cupboards at the Norris farmhouse were always filled with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee and homemade cookies.</p><p>In fact, his friendship with Ali (for so he was still calling it) had become very important to him. He eagerly looked forward to spending time with her every weekend. And although their physical relationship hadn\u2019t progressed beyond a few chaste kisses, their connection continued to deepen.</p><p>However, neither of them could have anticipated the overwhelming joy that was to come in early March when Paul was offered the position of assistant professor in the Department of English at Saint Michael\u2019s College. He didn\u2019t waste time fussing over the salary or negotiating a lighter teaching load or other perks. He simply accepted the job. Gladly.</p><p>He emailed Julia about his job offer and they resumed their occasional, friendly correspondence. He was stunned when, in mid-April, she emailed him announcing that she was pregnant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Given the fact that they\u2019d had a gap in their correspondence, Paul didn\u2019t feel comfortable interrogating her about the timing of her pregnancy. He certainly didn\u2019t want to upset her, not only because he treasured their friendship but because he didn\u2019t want Gabriel to withdraw his approval of his completed dissertation. Consequently, Paul simply sent her a congratulatory message and promised that he would send the baby a gift from Vermont.</p><p>Having successfully completed and defended his dissertation, and having survived graduation from the University of Toronto in June, Paul moved into his new office on the campus of St. Michael\u2019s College at the end of August.</p><p>He was happy. He was going to live at home while he saved for a down payment on a house. He would help out on the farm when he could, but his father\u2019s hired hands seemed to have everything running smoothly. And his father\u2019s health had improved significantly.</p><p>As he unpacked his books in his new office, he found his Dante and Beatrice action figures. Alas, the company that produced them had ignored his repeated requests for a Virgil action figure.</p> <p>(Once again, their official position was that Virgil was not worthy of action.)</p><p>He was just positioning Dante and Beatrice on top of his desk when he heard a knock.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he called over his shoulder, not turning around. \u201cThe door\u2019s open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Paul turned from Dante and Beatrice to see Allison standing in the doorway.</p> <p>In that instant, although he\u2019d seen her a thousand times, although he\u2019d known her for years, Paul was struck by how pretty she was\u2014her hair, her face, her eyes. She was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might be here. I wondered if you might need some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to do. I\u2019m just arranging my books.\u201d He placed the empty box on the floor.</p><p>Her face fell.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I didn\u2019t mean to bother you. I\u2019ll let you get back to work.\u201d</p><p>She turned to go, and Paul\u2019s heart plummeted into his shoes.</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and walked over to her, catching her hand in his.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were gone for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister needed help with her kids. I only planned to be gone for a week, but you know how it is.\u201d She reached up and pushed some of his hair back from his forehead. \u201cI missed you. I\u2019ve been counting the days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too. A lot.\u201d</p><p>They stared at one another for what seemed like an age before Paul found his words.</p> <p>\u201cI was going to take a break anyway. How about I take you to American Flatbread for pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>She moved to exit his office, but he tugged on her hand.</p><p>She looked up at him questioningly.</p><p>\u201cRoses,\u201d he whispered, stroking his work-roughened fingers over her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur first time together. Your skin smelled of roses.\u201d</p><p>Two patches of pink appeared on her face.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d remember.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her intensely.</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget? To this day, every time I smell roses I think of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wear roses anymore. I thought I grew out of them.\u201d</p><p>He reached up to cup her face in his hand.</p><p>She leaned into it and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWould you wear roses again? For me?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes, searching his.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He tried to show her with his expression that he was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cThen yes.\u201d</p><p>Allison moved into the gap between them and lightly pressed their lips together.</p><p>With a gentle push, Paul closed the door to his office and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>Chapter Eighty-two</p><p>September 9, 2012</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</p><p>A strangled moan emanated from the bathroom.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes snapped open. He was confused. For a moment, he didn\u2019t know where he was.</p><p>When he heard the moan again, he stumbled sleepily through the darkened bedroom.</p><p>\u201cDarling? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>When he entered the bathroom, he found Julia almost doubled over, clutching the marble-topped vanity with white-knuckled hands. She was breathing deeply.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to wake Rebecca?\u201d Gabriel turned to go, readying himself to sprint down the hall.</p><p>\u201cNo, call the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them I think I\u2019m in labor.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, he flew into a panic, hurriedly asking her questions, fumbling back into the bedroom to find his glasses and his cell phone, and hastily dialing the maternity ward of Mount Auburn Hospital.</p><p>\u201cHas your water broken?\u201d he asked, after he successfully reached a nurse.</p><p>\u201cNo. Your hardwood floors are safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Julianne. Are you in active labor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. The contractions are painful and regular.\u201d Julia tried to keep her breathing deep and relaxed, a technique she had practiced over and over again with her prenatal yoga teacher, who had promised success.</p><p>(Julia was contemplating asking for her money back.)</p><p>\u201cHow far apart are your contractions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix minutes.\u201d</p><p>She focused every ounce of her attention on her breathing and shut out the sound of his voice.</p><p>(She loved him, it was true, but he wasn\u2019t exactly helping.)</p><p>\u201cThe nurse said I should bring you in right now. I have your bag and the bag you packed for the baby. Are you ready?\u201d He tried to sound calm and began to rub her back through her loose-fitting T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Julia straightened up and took a good look at her husband.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He combed his hair with his fingers, trying to make himself look like someone who\u2019d had a full night\u2019s sleep. Then he scratched at his stubbled face. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to shave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at yourself.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gazed at his reflection in the mirror. To his shock and dismay, he was clad only in his underwear, a cheeky pair of boxer shorts that had the phrase Medievalists Do It in the Dark (Ages) printed all over them in phosphorescent lettering.</p><p>\u201cDamn it! Give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>Julia waddled after him into the bedroom, chuckling. \u201cScott will be very pleased that his Christmas present is coming with us to the hospital. At least if there\u2019s a power outage we\u2019ll be able to find you. You\u2019ll just have to drop your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the soul of comedy, Mrs. Emerson.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, finding his fashion faux pas slightly funnier than usual.</p><p>During the past couple of weeks, she\u2019d forgone the expensive lingerie he\u2019d bought her at Agent Provocateur, arguing that the items weren\u2019t warm enough. In response, Gabriel had declared that her maternity yoga pants and T-shirts \u201cdid a grave injustice to her sexiness\u201d and suggested she rely on his body to warm her.</p><p>She hugged a body pillow instead.</p><p>\u201cThose medieval boxer shorts do a grave injustice to your sexiness,\u201d she goaded him, clutching at her protruding abdomen as she cackled with delight.</p><p>He cast her a withering glance as he pulled on a pair of jeans and a shirt. Then he took her elbow and accompanied her down the hall. They paused just outside the nursery as another contraction seized her.</p><p>Gabriel switched on the pink-and-white chandelier so he could see her face. \u201cIs it very bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She tried to distract herself by leaning against the doorpost and staring into the baby\u2019s room.</p><p>She would have been content to purchase all the furnishings for the nursery from Target, but Gabriel had insisted on Pottery Barn.</p><p>(Parenthetically, it should be noted that Julia referred to Pottery Barn as Protestant Barn, for it featured fine furnishings that were WASP-ish in the extreme. Furnishings that she was enamored of but thought were too expensive.)</p><p>Together, and with items generously given by their friends and family, they\u2019d transformed one of the guest rooms into a tranquil space for a little girl. Julia chose sage green for the walls and a soft white for the woodwork and crown molding. A fanciful area rug that featured flowers in pink, yellow, and green pastels covered the oak floorboards.</p><p>\u201cThis is my favorite room in the whole world,\u201d she breathed, gazing at the classic Winnie the Pooh decals they had placed over the crib and changing table, in anticipation of wide and eager little eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s waiting for her.\u201d Gabriel smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s waiting for our little Spring Roll.\u201d</p><p>When Julia\u2019s contraction subsided, he took her hand and helped her down the stairs and into the Volvo, in which he\u2019d already installed the baby\u2019s car seat. He sent a text to Rebecca, explaining what was happening, and assured her he\u2019d be in touch.</p><p>A short while later, they arrived at the Bain Birthing Center at Mount Auburn Hospital. By the time they were settled in one of the birthing rooms, Gabriel had managed to conjure a calm exterior. He didn\u2019t want Julia to see his anxiety or to feel the way his insides churned with unspoken fears.</p><p>But she knew. She knew what he was afraid of, and she held his hand and told him that she and Spring Roll were going to be fine.</p><p>They held hands during her internal exam, in which the obstetrician on call announced that Spring Roll was in a transverse position and that she hoped the baby would decide to turn when it was time for her to be born.</p><p>Nurse Tracy quickly distracted a nervous Gabriel from demanding a complicated, illustrated explanation of transverse positions, teaching him to read the monitor so he could tell Julia when a contraction was peaking and when it was coming to an end.</p><p>She was grateful for his distraction. But that didn\u2019t stop him from Googling transverse positions and their attendant information on his iPhone.</p><p>(It should be noted that at that point, Julia wished he\u2019d left the damn thing at home.)</p><p>Fortunately, the pain medication relaxed her enough to allow her to nap, and she drifted into semiconsciousness.</p><p>\u201cJulianne?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes to see her husband standing over her, a concerned expression on his face.</p><p>She smiled at him weakly, and it almost broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou were moaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have been dreaming.\u201d</p><p>Julia reached out to him and he took her hand, bringing it up to his lips so he could kiss it.</p><p>\u201cMy rings,\u201d she whispered, pressing against his wedding band. \u201cDid I lose them?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her naked finger. \u201cYou took them off months ago, remember? Your fingers were swelling and you were worried they\u2019d get stuck. You started wearing them on the necklace I gave you a year ago, back in the orchard.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to touch her neck. \u201cI forgot. I put them in my jewelry box yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a premonition. Spring Roll is almost here.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anything would be more demanding than my program at Harvard. I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s heart clenched. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be back at the university soon enough. Rebecca and I will help.\u201d</p><p>Julia hummed in response.</p><p>\u201cI know it was too soon.\u201d He brought his mouth to her ear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about this. Sometimes surprises are the best things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a child with you isn\u2019t a hardship. Except for the pain.\u201d She grimaced.</p><p>He pressed his lips to her brow. \u201cI called my dad. He\u2019s going to speak to your dad and Diane. I doubt they\u2019ll be able to drive up with Tommy, but he\u2019s going to offer.\u201d</p><p>She nodded but didn\u2019t open her eyes. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>While Julia was sleeping, the obstetrician attempted to reassure Gabriel that the transverse positioning of babies was not uncommon. A baby would sometimes reposition herself during labor or the obstetrician would simply turn her. It was nothing to worry about.</p> <p>Gabriel was grateful for the doctor\u2019s encouragement but still anxious. What gave him strength was his hope for the future\u2014the knowledge that soon he would meet his daughter and he could begin being a father.</p><p>As Julia lay in her bed half-asleep and dreaming, he paced the room. She looked so small in the big hospital bed, so fragile.</p><p>So young.</p><p>Chapter Eighty-three</p><p>Julia?\u201d Gabriel held her hand as the next contraction gripped her. He kept a watchful eye on the monitor so he could announce when the contraction was beginning to subside, and then afterward he would gently stroke her knuckles or her forehead, praising her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing so well.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel was not. He was disheveled and nervous and, if he were to take the time to think about it, extremely concerned. Despite the fact that they were in a well-respected hospital in Boston and enjoying excellent medical care, he was terrified.</p><p>He kept his fears to himself, silently praying over and over that Julia and Spring Roll would be all right.</p><p>Shortly before nine o\u2019clock in the evening, Julia began to run a fever. By that time, Dr. Rubio was on call. She examined Julia and ordered an antibiotic added to her intravenous drip.</p><p>Gabriel chewed at his lip as he watched the nurse hang the bag next to the other fluids that slowly dripped into his wife\u2019s arm.</p><p>Dr. Rubio broke Julia\u2019s water and encouraged her to begin pushing. Her epidural succeeded in taking only some of the pain away, and much of it remained. Julia still had feeling in the lower half of her body.</p><p>Nurse Susan held one of Julia\u2019s legs while Gabriel held the other. She pushed with each contraction, and although Dr. Rubio and Gabriel cheered her on, very little happened. Eventually the obstetrician admitted what Gabriel had been afraid of\u2014Spring Roll was stubbornly maintaining her transverse position, and she was situated too high up to be delivered with forceps.</p><p>Julia groaned weakly at the news, collapsing back on the bed in near exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d asked Gabriel quietly, his hands folding into fists.</p> <p>Dr. Rubio pursed her lips.</p><p>\u201cIt means we need to do an emergency cesarean section. The baby\u2019s heart rate is beginning to increase, your wife is running a fever, and it\u2019s possible there\u2019s an infection. I\u2019ll assemble my surgical team, but we need to do this right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me,\u201d said Julia. She was tired. Oh, so tired. The idea of having an end to labor brought welcome relief.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Gabriel nervously clutched her hand.</p><p>\u201cThere really aren\u2019t any other options, Mr. Emerson. I can\u2019t deliver this baby in the position she\u2019s in.\u201d Dr. Rubio\u2019s voice was firm.</p><p>\u201cAs I told you before, it\u2019s Professor Emerson,\u201d he snapped, his frazzled emotions getting the best of him.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, relax. We\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d Julia smiled thinly and closed her eyes, willing herself to outlast the contractions that continued wracking her body.</p><p>Gabriel poured his apology into a chaste kiss and a few whispered words of comfort before Julia\u2019s room became an epicenter of activity. The anesthesiologist arrived and asked a series of questions. The nurse asked Gabriel to follow her so that he could change into surgical scrubs.</p><p>He did not want to be separated from Julia, not even for an instant. He\u2019d spent hours at her side, feeding her ice chips and holding her hand. But since he wanted to be with her in the operating room and it was a sterile environment, he agreed to go.</p><p>Before he left, Julia extended her hand. He took it, pressing his lips to her palm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t regret this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He pulled back. The pain medication seemed to be affecting her thought processes.</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t you regret, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting pregnant. After this is over, we\u2019re going to have a little girl. We\u2019ll be a family. Forever.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a tight smile and kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a few minutes. You stay strong.\u201d</p><p>She returned his smile and closed her eyes, adjusting her breathing in order to deal with the next contraction.</p><p>Chapter Eighty-four</p><p>In his absence, Julia simply closed her eyes and focused on her breathing\u2014that is, until she was lying in the obstetric operating room and Dr. Rubio began touching the area that had been prepped for incision.</p><p>\u201cI can feel that,\u201d said Julia, clearly alarmed.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel like pressure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can feel you pinching the skin.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sat at Julia\u2019s side, above the screen that blocked her lower body from his view.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, sounding panicked. \u201cBut I can still feel pain. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll feel the incision.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Rubio repeated her test, pinching and twisting at Julia\u2019s skin, and Julia insisted with increasing anxiety that she could feel every pinch.</p><p>\u201cWe have to put her out,\u201d announced the anesthesiologist, moving swiftly to prepare a general anesthetic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard on the baby. Give her something else,\u201d Dr. Rubio objected.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give her any more. She\u2019s had an epidural and a top-up. I\u2019m putting her out.\u201d</p><p>Julia looked up into the kind eyes of the anesthesiologist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The anesthesiologist patted her shoulder. \u201cHoney, you don\u2019t need to be sorry. I do this all the time. Just try to relax.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel began asking questions as the surgical team buzzed around him.</p><p>Julia squeezed his hand as if willing him not to lose his temper. She needed him to be calm. She needed him to watch over her while she slept.</p><p>She barely noticed what the doctors were doing, or the anesthesiologist\u2019s instructions. The last thing she heard before she drifted into the darkness was Gabriel\u2019s voice in her ear, assuring her that he would be with her until she woke up.</p><p>Chapter Eighty-five</p><p>Damn it.\u201d Dr. Rubio released a current of rapid-fire demands and instructions, and her team sprang into action.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s grip on Julia\u2019s limp hand tightened.</p><p>Dr. Rubio jerked her head toward Gabriel, without making eye contact. \u201cGet the husband out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gabriel stood to his feet. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said get him out of here,\u201d Dr. Rubio barked at one of the nurses. \u201cAnd get the surgeon on call down here. Stat.\u201d</p><p>The nurse began herding Gabriel toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Tell me!\u201d He raised his voice, directing his questions at the medical team.</p><p>No one answered.</p><p>The nurse took his arm and tugged.</p><p>Gabriel took one last look at Julia, her eyelids taped shut. Her skin pale. Her body still.</p><p>She looked as if she were dead.</p><p>\u201cWill she be all right?\u201d</p><p>The nurse led him through the swinging door and out into the surgical waiting room.</p><p>\u201cSomeone will be out to speak to you soon.\u201d The nurse nodded encouragingly at Gabriel before returning to the operating room.</p><p>He slumped into a chair, his mind spinning. One minute they had been preparing for the cesarean section and the next . . .</p><p>He pulled the surgical mask from his face.</p><p>Panic and fear raced through his veins. All he could see was Julia\u2019s face, her arms stretched out from her body as if she were on a cross.</p><p>In Gabriel\u2019s mind he was in the backyard of his house in Selinsgrove, walking toward the woods. He\u2019d trod that path a thousand times. He could navigate it in the dark. Now it was daylight.</p><p>As he approached the woods, he heard a voice calling his name.</p><p>He turned around to see Grace standing on the back porch, beckoning him.</p><p>\u201cCome back.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, pointing in the direction of the orchard. \u201cI have to go get her. I\u2019ve lost her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lost her.\u201d Grace smiled patiently.</p><p>\u201cI have. She\u2019s gone.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s heart rate quickened.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t gone. Come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go and get her.\u201d Gabriel scanned the trees for any sign of Julianne before entering the woods. His steps quickened until he was running, branches snapping and scraping at his clothes and face. He stumbled to his hands and knees just as he entered the clearing. He scanned the area quickly, and an anguished cry escaped from his lips as he realized Julianne was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Chapter Eighty-six</p><p>I can\u2019t believe we lost one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can I. Two emergency c-sections at the same time. At least only one went south.\u201d The voice sighed. \u201cI hate nights like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Thank God our shift is over.\u201d</p><p>It took a few minutes for Gabriel to open his eyes. Had he been asleep or . . .</p><p>He rubbed at his chin. He didn\u2019t know. One minute, he was in the woods behind his house, the next he could hear nurses talking.</p><p>His head began buzzing as his memory of Julianne lying on the table, pale and unmoving, came back to him.</p><p>The nurses must have been talking about her.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe we lost one.</p><p>He fought back a sob as he heard footsteps, his eyes focusing on a pair of ugly shoes. It was grossly inappropriate, he knew, but he couldn\u2019t help but notice how thick and unflattering they were. As if they were made of wood.</p><p>What a waste of a perfectly good podiatric opportunity.</p><p>He lifted his head.</p><p>The nurse, whom he hadn\u2019t seen before, gave him a restrained smile. \u201cI\u2019m Angie, Mr. Emerson. Would you like to meet your daughter?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and stumbled to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you were sitting there so long. Someone should have brought you to her before, but things have been really busy and we\u2019ve just had a shift change.\u201d</p><p>She led him into an adjoining room, where a bassinet was situated. Another nurse was standing nearby, writing on a chart.</p><p>Gabriel walked over to the bassinet and looked down.</p><p>A little bundle of white lay motionless. He saw a reddish face, and black hair that was partially covered by a tiny, purple knitted cap.</p><p>\u201cShe has hair.\u201d</p><p>Angie stood next to him. \u201cYes, lots of hair. She\u2019s almost nine pounds and nineteen inches long. She\u2019s a good-sized baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angie picked up the child, cradling her. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you a wristband that matches hers so we know she\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>The second nurse affixed a white plastic wristband on Gabriel\u2019s right wrist.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to hold her?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, wiping his cold, clammy palms on his green surgical scrubs.</p> <p>Angie gently placed the baby in his arms. Immediately, the child opened large, dark blue eyes and looked up at him.</p><p>Their eyes met and Gabriel felt as if his entire world stopped.</p><p>Then she yawned, her tiny rosebud mouth expanding greatly, before she closed her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is. And she\u2019s healthy. It was a difficult delivery, but she\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll notice that her face is a bit swollen, but that will come down.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel lifted the baby so she was inches from his face.</p><p>\u201cHello, Spring Roll. I\u2019m your daddy and I\u2019ve been waiting to meet you for a long time. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>He held her close, listening to her tiny breaths, feeling her little heart beat through the swaddling material.</p><p>\u201cMy wife,\u201d he croaked, not bothering to blink away the tears that had re-formed in his eyes.</p><p>The nurses exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cDid Dr. Rubio talk to you?\u201d Angie asked.</p> <p>Gabriel shook his head, holding the baby tightly.</p><p>Angie looked to the other nurse, who frowned.</p><p>\u201cShe should have spoken to you by now. I\u2019m sorry about that. It\u2019s been very busy, as I said, and there was a shift change.\u201d Angie gestured to a nearby chair. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down with your daughter, and I\u2019ll go see if I can find the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel did as he was told, holding his daughter close to his heart.</p><p>The nurses\u2019 expressions said it all.</p><p>There would be no happy reconciliation.</p><p>There would be no vision of Julia holding their child.</p><p>He\u2019d lost her. As surely as Dante had lost Beatrice, he\u2019d lost his beloved.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve failed you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Hugging his daughter close to his chest, Gabriel cried.</p><p>Chapter Eighty-seven</p><p>As Gabriel sat, holding Spring Roll, time seemed to have no meaning. Images flashed before his eyes. He saw himself taking the baby home from the hospital. Feeding her in the middle of the night. Walking down the hall to the empty master bedroom.</p><p>He was so alone.</p><p>He\u2019d loved one woman in his life. At first, he\u2019d loved her like a pagan, eager to make her an idol and worship her. Then he\u2019d recognized that some things were more important than his love for her\u2014her happiness, for example.</p><p>In his mind\u2019s eye he could see and hear her clutching his hand, whispering, \u201cI don\u2019t regret getting pregnant.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d regret it now. He\u2019d taken her life.</p><p>His shoulders shuddered as a sob overtook him.</p><p>His beautiful, sweet Julianne.</p><p>He had his cell phone but didn\u2019t feel like talking to anyone. From the texts he\u2019d received, he knew that Richard and Rachel would be arriving soon. Rebecca was readying the house for the guests and the baby. Kelly had texted to say that she\u2019d ordered flowers and balloons, which were on their way to the hospital.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t had the will to tell them Julianne was gone.</p><p>He stared at the face of his daughter, wondering how he was going to parent her alone. He\u2019d relied on Julianne for so much. And ultimately, it was his selfishness that ended her life.</p><p>He was lost in his own grief and exhaustion when someone entered the room and stood before him. Once again his eyes focused on a pair of very ugly, sturdy shoes.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Emerson.\u201d</p><p>He recognized the voice of Dr. Rubio and lifted his head.</p><p>She looked tired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened. We had several emergencies all at once and I couldn\u2019t get away. I\u2019m sorry it took me so long to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see her?\u201d Gabriel interrupted.</p><p>\u201cOf course. But I just need to explain. Your wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gabriel couldn\u2019t hear the doctor\u2019s words. He was enveloped in pain. All his conversations with Julia about children flooded his mind.</p><p>This was his fault. He\u2019d persuaded her to have a baby and then they\u2019d gotten pregnant before she was ready.</p><p>He\u2019d done this. He\u2019d planted his child inside her, and the act had killed her.</p><p>He lowered his head despondently.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Emerson.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Rubio came closer.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Emerson, are you all right?\u201d Her lightly accented voice sounded at his ear. She muttered to herself in Spanish, words that Gabriel identified, but dimly.</p><p>\u201cCan I see her?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Dr. Rubio gestured to the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry someone didn\u2019t come to get you earlier, but the nursing staff was overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel slowly got to his feet, continuing to cradle his daughter in his arms.</p><p>Dr. Rubio directed him to place the baby in the bassinet, and then she wheeled the contraption in front of her.</p><p>He pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped at his face, ignoring the initials that had been embroidered on it. It had been a gift from Julianne \u201cjust because.\u201d She was like that\u2014generous of spirit and generous of heart. How he wished he\u2019d worn the Star of David she\u2019d given to him as an anniversary present. Surely he could have derived some comfort from it.</p><p>Gabriel followed Dr. Rubio through a series of rooms, until they entered a very large space that had a number of hospital beds in it.</p><p>\u201cHere she is.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stopped abruptly.</p><p>Julianne was lying in a hospital bed and a nurse was leaning over her, giving her an injection.</p><p>He could see her legs shift beneath the blanket. He could hear her moan.</p><p>He blinked rapidly, as if the tears in his eyes had caused a mirage.</p><p>He felt his body sway.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Emerson?\u201d Dr. Rubio took hold of his elbow in an effort to steady him. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She called to the nurse and asked her to place a chair next to Julia\u2019s bedside. They helped Gabriel to the chair and wheeled the bassinet so that it was next to him.</p><p>Someone pushed a plastic cup of water into his hand. He stared at it as if it were a foreign object.</p><p>Dr. Rubio\u2019s voice, which had been hazy in his ear, suddenly became clear.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, your wife lost a lot of blood. We had to give her a transfusion. When I made the incision for the cesarean section, I encountered one of her fibroids, and unfortunately it bled quite a bit. We had to do some surgical repair afterward, which is why the procedure took so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFibroids?\u201d Gabriel repeated, his hand over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOne of her fibroids was attached to the uterus right at the place where we make the incision. We stopped the bleeding and stitched her up, but it made the c-section more complicated than usual. Fortunately, Dr. Manganiello, the surgeon on call, scrubbed in. Your wife is going to be fine.\u201d She placed a hand on Gabriel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd there doesn\u2019t appear to be any permanent damage to her uterus. She\u2019ll be waking up soon but she\u2019ll be woozy. We\u2019ll be giving her medication to control the pain. I\u2019ll check on her tomorrow during my rounds. Congratulations on the birth of your daughter. She\u2019s a beautiful little girl.\u201d Dr. Rubio patted his shoulder and left.</p><p>Gabriel stared at Julia, noticing that the color in her skin had returned. She was sleeping.</p><p>\u201cMr. Emerson?\u201d The nurse noticed his tears. \u201cCan I get you something?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, quickly wiping his face with the back of his hand. \u201cI thought she was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The nurse\u2019s tone was sharp.</p><p>\u201cNo one told me. She looked like she was dead. I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>The nurse came a step closer, a look of horror on her face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Someone from the previous shift should have explained what was happening. There was another emergency c-section at the same time as your wife\u2019s, but that patient lost her baby.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lifted his eyes to meet the nurse\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t an excuse,\u201d the nurse said quietly. \u201cSomeone should have told you that your wife was all right. I\u2019ve worked in labor and delivery here for ten years and we lose very few mothers. Very, very few. And when we do, there is an immediate inquest and everyone is extremely upset.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was about to ask what \u201cvery few\u201d meant when he heard a groan coming from Julia\u2019s hospital bed. He put the cup of water aside and stood over her.</p><p>\u201cJulianne?\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered open. She looked at him for only an instant, then closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOur daughter is here. She\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Julianne didn\u2019t move.</p><p>But a few minutes later, she began moaning again.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHold on. I\u2019ll get someone.\u201d Gabriel called the nurse.</p><p>After the nurse adjusted Julia\u2019s intravenous, Gabriel picked up the baby.</p><p>\u201cDarling, meet your daughter. She\u2019s beautiful. And she has hair.\u201d He held the baby up so Julia could see her from her reclined position.</p><p>Julia\u2019s gaze was wide and unfocused before she closed her eyes.</p><p>He cradled the baby against his chest once again.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will take a while for her to come around. But she\u2019ll wake up eventually.\u201d The voice of the nurse broke into Gabriel\u2019s musings, as he wondered anxiously if Julia was unhappy about how the baby looked.</p><p>He placed the child back in her bassinet and sat next to it, keeping a watchful eye on his wife. He was never going to let her out of his sight again.</p><p>His iPhone chirped with a couple of texts, and he quickly checked it. Richard and Rachel were making excellent time and would arrive soon. Tom and Diane sent their congratulations and their love.</p><p>And Katherine Picton restated her insistence that she be named godmother. She even promised a rare manuscript of Dante\u2019s La Vita Nuova as an inducement.</p><p>Gabriel snapped a few photos of Spring Roll with his phone and quickly emailed them to everyone, including Kelly, pausing to tell Katherine that no inducement would be required.</p><p>\u201cShe has hair?\u201d When Julia finally awoke, the first thing she noticed was the dark strands peeking out from under the baby\u2019s purple knit cap.</p><p>\u201cShe does. Lots of hair. Darker than yours.\u201d Gabriel grinned and placed the baby on Julia\u2019s chest.</p><p>She unwrapped the baby and peeled back her gown, placing her daughter skin against skin. The infant immediately snuggled into her mother.</p><p>In Gabriel\u2019s mind, it was the most incredible sight he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Julia whispered.</p><p>\u201cPretty like her mama.\u201d</p><p>She pressed gentle kisses to the baby\u2019s head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. She has your face.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I\u2019m not sure she looks like either one of us, except that she seems to have my eye color. She has the biggest eyes you\u2019ve ever seen, but she doesn\u2019t like to open them.\u201d</p><p>Julia lifted her head to examine the baby\u2019s face, cuddling her even closer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel watched her with concern. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cI feel as if I\u2019ve been sawn in half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you were.\u201d</p><p>She peered up at him questioningly.</p> <p>\u201cNo darling, I didn\u2019t look.\u201d He brushed a kiss against her hair. \u201cWe should probably talk about what we\u2019re going to call her. Her grandfathers are not going to be impressed with the name Spring Roll. And I\u2019ve already heard from Katherine, who thinks the baby should be named after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about Clare.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel considered that possibility for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI like Clare, but since we prayed at St. Francis\u2019s crypt, perhaps we should call her Frances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Clare was Francis\u2019s friend. We could call her Clare and make Grace her middle name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGrace.\u201d Gabriel caught Julia\u2019s eye and felt himself choking up. \u201cHow about Clare Grace Hope? She represents the culmination of so much hope, so much grace . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cClare Grace Hope Emerson. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d Julia kissed Clare on her tiny cheek.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s perfect.\u201d Gabriel kissed Julianne and Clare and wrapped his arms around them both.</p><p>\u201cMy sweet, sweet girls.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighty-eight</p><p>Julia slept soundly, her breathing deep and her form unmoving. When the nurse directed Gabriel to place Clare in the bassinet so that he could sleep, he refused. He held his daughter in his arms as if he were afraid she\u2019d be taken away from him.</p> <p>His eyes grew heavy and he reclined in the chair next to Julia\u2019s bed, placing his daughter on his chest. With a yawn, she seemed content, her cheek resting against him, her tiny bottom in the air.</p><p>\u201cFaith, hope, and charity,\u201d he murmured to himself. \u201cBut the greatest of these is charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Julia shifted in bed, turning toward him.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>Julia moved her legs tentatively, clutching the place where her incision was. \u201cThe pain is coming back. I\u2019m probably due for a shot.\u201d</p><p>She looked over at him, at the way he was holding Clare in his arms, her body resting in the center of his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a natural, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. But even if I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll work hard to become one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Julia whispered, her eyes filling with tears.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was possible to love someone other than you so much.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cupped Clare\u2019s head with his hand.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, either.\u201d He kissed his daughter\u2019s head. \u201cIn fact, I was just disagreeing with St. Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She wiped away a tear. \u201cAnd what did he say in response?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel caught her eye. She grinned.</p><p>\u201cI told him that the greatest virtue isn\u2019t charity; it\u2019s hope. I discovered charity with Richard and Grace, but also with you. And it helped me through some very dark days. I also discovered faith, when I went to Assisi. But without hope, I wouldn\u2019t be here. I would have taken my life. Without divine intervention in the form of a teenage girl in a Pennsylvania orchard, I\u2019d be in Hell and not sitting at your side holding our daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she whispered, the tears flowing.</p><p>\u201cCharity is a great virtue, and so is faith. But hope means the most to me. This is hope.\u201d He gestured to the baby girl on his chest, swaddled in white and wearing a tiny knit cap.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s prayers of thanks were spontaneous and heartfelt.
