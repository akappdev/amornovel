She leaned into the Leupold scope and settled the crosshairs on her target. Data ran through her brain, was processed, and let go. Like all snipers, she tended to step out of the moment when she was shooting, focusing only on the target, the shot. She concentrated on taking shallow, even breaths, her entire world reduced to what she could see beyond the crosshairs.</p><p>It was a relatively easy shot. Eighty yards, less than the length of a football field. A slight breeze was blowing, but at this distance, that wasn\u2019t enough to matter. The target was stationary, but armed. Not a problem. Law enforcement snipers were trained to go for the head shot, to immediately incapacitate a subject holding a weapon, if necessary. It was a shot she\u2019d made a hundred times on the range. No hesitation, no nerves. Just line up the shot and take it.</p> <p>Kathryn heard the go-ahead come over her radio. She exhaled slowly and squeezed the trigger.</p><p>\u201cAnd bye-bye terrorist! Kathryn, baby, you are the best!\u201d Eduardo Saver, her friend and the day\u2019s range supervisor, said over the radio, confirming what she already knew. She\u2019d hit the target dead on. His enthusiastic reaction wasn\u2019t exactly protocol, but there were only the two of them on the range this afternoon, so he\u2019d gone for friendship instead of professionalism. Kathryn grinned as her heart started pumping again, and she felt the rush of adrenaline begin to fade. Her body didn\u2019t care that this was just another practice shoot in a long line of practices. Once she got behind the scope, everything narrowed down to the crosshairs and the annihilation of her target.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Eduardo,\u201d she said as he came up behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou going out with the rest of us later?\u201d Eduardo asked. \u201cTime to let some hair down, chica. All work and no play . . .\u201d</p><p>Kathryn turned as she sat up from her prone position, her hand going self-consciously to her hair in its tight French braid. She forced a laugh. \u201cMaybe. The usual place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Eduardo said. He looked down at her with a leering grin. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d She rolled her eyes at him. Eduardo wasn\u2019t interested in her that way. She was too tall and too pale for his tastes. \u201cI\u2019ve got to stow this,\u201d she said, indicating her weapon. \u201cBut maybe I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>She stood, reaching automatically for the cell phone on her belt and switching it back on. It was always off during range exercises. The phone vibrated almost at once, and she pulled it off her belt one-handed, frowning at the message she saw there.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>She looked up. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s Penelope Bateman, my brother\u2019s agent. He\u2019s on one of his solitary photo adventures, and she\u2019s probably just calling with a message from him. He does that sometimes if he can\u2019t get a hold of me.\u201d</p><p>Eduardo touched her arm to get her attention. \u201cSee you at the bar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she agreed absently, giving him a brief glance before returning to the call log on her phone. Penny had called several times in the last hour.</p><p>She placed her weapon on the wood plank table and popped the magazine, checking automatically to be certain the weapon was empty. She then wiped it down and used a soft brush on the scope lenses before placing it in the custom-made hard shell case. After closing the case, she made a few notes in her field book, mostly range and target information, since shooting conditions had been as close to ideal as they ever got. As she wrote, she bemoaned, as always, that so far she\u2019d never had a chance to fire her weapon anywhere except on the range. She was a skilled shooter, but since 9/11, the FBI\u2019s emphasis was all about terrorism. She spent far more of her time sitting at a desk than she did out in the field, and had begun to regret the Quantico posting she\u2019d been so excited about a few years ago.</p><p>She sighed and tucked the field book away, then pulled out her cell phone and hit the call back on Penny\u2019s last message.</p><p>\u201cKathryn!\u201d Penny answered almost before the phone had stopped ringing the first time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Penny, did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething terrible\u2019s happened! Danny\u2019s missing!\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Two Weeks Later</p> <p>Near the Minnesota/Wisconsin Border</p><p>The huge SUVs were three black blurs of speed as they roared through the night. Lucas Donlon sat in the middle seat of the second SUV, listening to the chatter of his vampires, both around him and through his headset for those in the other trucks. They were hyped and ready for action, almost too hyped after the hours of travel to get this far. Even with a private jet, it took time.</p><p>But they were here now, and Lucas was with his warriors in feeling the rush of impending battle, the pump of adrenaline as he prepared to fight to the death. It was a rare thing in this civilized world, with its laws and cameras everywhere. But tonight\u2019s confrontation would mark the beginning of a war between vampires\u2014something this continent hadn\u2019t seen in nearly a century. And how better to start a war than with the death of a traitor? Alfonso Heintz didn\u2019t know they were coming for him, but he would soon, and his fear would taste just as sweet as his blood. Maybe better.</p><p>The trucks rolled down the unlit rural roads, running dark. The vampire drivers didn\u2019t need the lights to see by, and Lucas didn\u2019t want to advertise his presence to anyone yet, human or vampire. Not until he had his prey cornered. Alfonso Heintz was sworn to Lucas, but had recently moved his entire household just over the border into Wisconsin, near the small college town of River Falls. It was no more than 30 miles from Minneapolis, but crossing the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin took him out of Lucas\u2019s PlainsTerritory and into the territory of Lucas\u2019s enemy, the Lord of the Midwest, Klemens.</p><p>Had Lucas needed it, Heintz\u2019s move over the border would have confirmed the vampire\u2019s guilt. But he already knew the vampire was guilty and needed no more evidence. In truth, if the traitor had known his betrayal had been discovered, he\u2019d have moved much farther than a few miles over the border. As if a few miles, or a few thousand miles, would ever stop Lucas from exacting the justice he was due. This was war. Boundaries no longer mattered.</p><p>But whether or not Heintz realized he\u2019d been discovered, he would surely have a guard or two on lookout. Unfortunately for Heintz, most of the vampires hiding away with him were also sworn to Lucas, a fact that he clearly didn\u2019t fully appreciate, in terms of its ramifications for security. Lucas could drop any vampire sworn to him with nothing more than a thought. It was likely, of course, that one or two of Klemens\u2019s people would be in the house tonight, and they\u2019d require close up killing. But then, Lucas had no intention of winning this battle from a distance. He intended to punish the traitors in a very up close and personal fashion. In fact, he hoped Heintz and his fellow miscreants put up one hell of a fight, because Lucas and his people were ready to rock and roll.</p><p>The target house was big and wide, a two-story clapboard with a long, covered front porch. The building was completely dark when the SUVs skidded on the light snow covering the dirt patch of a front yard. It appeared empty, but the large number of cars and trucks parked around back told a different story. Lucas sent a small tendril of power creeping into the house and found thirteen vampires, all wide awake and jittery with nerves. By now, Heintz and his people knew Lucas had arrived, and they were probably wishing they\u2019d hidden themselves a lot better than they had.</p><p>Lucas reached forward and clapped his lieutenant on the shoulder, where he sat in the front passenger seat. \u201cLet\u2019s be polite, Nick. I\u2019m sure Heintz and his minions will be excited as hell to receive a visit from their rightful lord and master.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas laughed and issued a few terse commands into his throat mike. The doors popped open on all three SUVs, and black-clad vampires poured out, deploying quickly to surround the house. Every one of them was a highly trained and powerful fighter. By virtue of their vampire blood, they were weapons unto themselves, but they also carried whatever human weapons they preferred, from 9mm handguns to compact submachine guns. And no doubt a knife or three thrown into the mix.</p><p>Lucas himself carried no weapon other than the power which made him one of the most feared vampires in North America\u2014a vampire lord, ruler of the PlainsTerritory. Thousands of vampires literally lived and died at his command. Including Alfonso Heintz. Traitor or not, Heintz was still beholden to Lucas for every breath he drew, every beat of his heart. Klemens might have used Heintz, but he hadn\u2019t offered his protection, hadn\u2019t taken his oath of fealty. Which meant if Lucas wanted, he could have shriveled the unfaithful bastard\u2019s heart in his chest without ever leaving South Dakota.</p><p>But where was the fun in that?</p><p>Nicholas caught Lucas\u2019s eye and nodded once, then took up position to the left and slightly ahead of his Sire. They climbed three short steps up to the covered porch, and Nicholas knocked on the door. Or perhaps pounded would be more accurate. It was the adrenaline. Lucas stifled the urge to laugh. He loved this shit. After weeks of playing nice, of waiting while various vampire politics played out, he was ready for first blood.</p><p>The door creaked open, and a slender vampire stood there, his eyes wide with fear. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he managed to stammer out. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect you.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was a lie, Lucas thought to himself. No one, neither human nor vampire, could lie successfully to a vampire lord. This was not a very auspicious beginning. Who was this child anyway? Not one of his.</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t bother with further niceties. He simply shoved the vampire out of the way and pushed the door open, slamming it against the wall.</p><p>Lucas followed him inside. \u201cWhere\u2019s Heintz?\u201d he asked the trembling vampire.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, my lord, but he\u2019s not here. He had to\u2014\u201d The sentence ended on a squeak as Lucas picked the vampire up by his throat and dangled him several inches off the ground. \u201cFool. Do you think you can lie to me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d the vampire rasped. \u201cI only\u2014\u201d Lucas had no interest in what this one had to say. Heintz had sent him forward as a sacrifice, and he had fulfilled his purpose. Lucas granted him the mercy of snapping his neck before he incinerated his heart with a short burst of power.</p><p>\u201cNicholas?\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>\u201cReady at your command, my lord.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas sent his power raging through the big house. It spread outward like a massive concussion of air, rushing up the stairs, sending furniture crashing into walls, slamming open doors and breaking windows. Screams sounded from deep inside the structure, some of them muffled, as if in a vault or safe room. Lucas laughed out loud and turned to his lieutenant.</p><p>\u201cThe command is given,\u201d he said and strode forward, his eyes flashing gold fire with the furnace of his power, his fangs in full view and gleaming. \u201cAlfonso!\u201d His voice boomed out like the wrath of God, or the wrath of a vampire lord, which was eminently worse. God was rumored to have a sense of mercy, whereas Lucas had none, especially not for traitors.</p><p>His vampires moved in from all sides, and the battle began, the air filled with the enraged roars of the combatants and the terrified screams of the dying. There were no humans in the house. Heintz had been that smart, at least.</p><p>Lucas passed several fights in progress, but he ignored everything in his search for Heintz. The coward was hiding. Lucas laughed gleefully and picked up his speed, racing through the house until he stood in front of a daytime sleeping vault. Heintz was behind that door, along with . . . Lucas tilted his head as his mind reached out . . . two other vampires. And they both belonged to Lucas. What an ass. These vaults had been designed to withstand human assault, not that of a powerful vampire. If the traitor was going to try to hide here, he should at least have been clever enough to hide behind someone Lucas couldn\u2019t easily control.</p><p>Almost bored with the simplicity of it, Lucas sent his mind out and touched each of the two vampires cowering inside the vault with Heintz, ordering them to open the door and present themselves to their master. He could have ordered Heintz to deliver himself, too, but it was much more pleasurable to drink in the sweet taste of the bastard\u2019s terror when he realized what was happening.</p> <p>The heavy vault door swung open to reveal the two vampires already dropping back to their knees, heads bowed. Even Heintz had assumed the penitent posture. As if that would save any of them from their treachery.</p><p>Lucas entered the vault, moving with the preternatural speed of his vampire nature, and ripped the heads off the two vampires flanking Heintz. Blood sprayed from their severed arteries, coating Heintz in the thick red stuff. He swayed, moaning with fear, hands clasped in front of him as if in prayer.</p><p>Lucas regarded him dispassionately. \u201cThe sniper talked, Alfonso. He didn\u2019t even bother to put up a fight. Saved himself the agony of torture. Unlike you, he was smart enough to see the writing on the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Master,\u201d Heintz whispered. \u201cI had no choice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence, worm. You had a choice. You simply made the wrong one. Bad enough that you betrayed me\u2014\u201d Sudden rage rose hot and heavy in Lucas\u2019s heart, nearly choking him with fury. He shoved his closed fist into Heintz\u2019s open mouth, shattering his fangs as he rammed the fist down the vampire\u2019s throat and used it as a lever to lift him into the air.</p><p>\u201cYou conspired with my enemy and hired a human to assassinate my Sire,\u201d he snarled, and saw Heintz\u2019s already terrified eyes fill with horror. Very few vampires still alive knew that Raphael was Lucas\u2019s Sire. Both of them wanted it that way. It was a weapon they wielded in secret, and Lucas only voiced it now, because he wanted Heintz to understand the full magnitude of his sin before he died. Painfully.</p> <p>The vampire was trying to shake his head, making guttural sounds deep in his throat, no doubt of denial. But it was far too late for that.</p><p>Lucas shook Heintz off his fist, dropping him to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI beg you\u2014\u201d The worm began whining almost immediately, and Lucas flicked his fingers, silencing him.</p><p>He gazed down at the sniveling vampire dispassionately, then stepped back and started breaking bones, beginning with the little ones, fingers and toes, the delicate bones in the hand. Heintz groaned softly at first, but by the time Lucas had started on the big bones\u2014the tibia and fibula in the calf, the thick femur in the thigh\u2014the vampire was grunting like a rutting pig, the only sounds of pain he was able to make. Bloody tears streamed down his face as he groveled on the ground, unable to even wipe the snot from his chin.</p><p>Lucas worked systematically, splitting the skin open when he ran out of bones, slicing the abdomen and watching the vampire\u2019s gray entrails spill onto the blood-slicked floor, making certain to keep the spinal cord intact and the heart beating. He wanted Heintz to feel every last ounce of pain before he died.</p><p>He was crouched over the bloody form of ruptured flesh and shattered bone when Nicholas found him. Heintz was whimpering weakly, his heart still beating, his vampire blood keeping him alive despite the destruction of every other major organ.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Lucas asked Nicholas, never taking his eyes off Heintz.</p><p>\u201cThe other twelve are dead and dusted, my lord,\u201d Nicholas said, crouching next to him and eyeing the wreckage of Heintz curiously, like a bug splayed for study. \u201cWhat about this one?\u201d</p> <p>A small smile tipped the side of Lucas\u2019s mouth. \u201cHis heart is still beating,\u201d he said. \u201cI could take him with us, see how long it takes him to regenerate enough to crawl.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas winced. \u201cHe\u2019ll get blood all over the new Gulfstream.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed. \u201cGood point. Very well.\u201d He dug through the gore until he found Heintz\u2019s beating heart and ripped it from its moorings. The vampire gave a final squeal of pain, and then died as his heart burst into flame on Lucas\u2019s palm. The bloody mess turned to ash in moments, leaving nothing but a dark stain as testament that Alfonso Heintz had ever lived.</p><p>Lucas stood, slapping his hands together and eyeing his clothes in dismay. The black fabric went a long way toward concealing the blood, but he knew it was there. It was wet and sticky and damned uncomfortable. And it would soon begin to stink. Plus there was the new jet\u2019s interior to consider.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said, automatically sending his thoughts out, verifying the well-being of each of the vampire warriors he\u2019d brought with him. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the trucks back and overnight at the Minneapolis house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the FBI visit? Even if we leave first thing at sunset tomorrow, it\u2019ll be hours before we get there.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s dealing with vampires. If she\u2019s stupid enough to show up too early, she\u2019ll just have to wait. God knows she\u2019s made me wait long enough.\u201d He spared the stain of Alfonso Heintz a final glance, then started for the front of the house. \u201cCome on. I want this place burned to the ground before we leave.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Quantico, Virginia</p><p>\u201cHunter, come in.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stepped into SAC William Fielding\u2019s office. It was as neat as the man, obsessively neat, in her view. And that was saying something, since Kathryn wasn\u2019t exactly known for her messy work habits.</p><p>\u201cClose the door,\u201d Fielding directed.</p><p>Kathryn complied, her jaw tightening automatically as she considered what it meant that he wanted the door closed. Fielding was better known for leaving the door wide open, especially where female agents were concerned. He was convinced women were naturally predisposed to sleep their way to the top and had a morbid fear of sexual harassment lawsuits.</p><p>Fielding wasn\u2019t a bad looking man, and she was sure he\u2019d had his share of admirers over the years, but culturally, he was trapped in the fifties. And he made no secret of the fact that he believed the FBI had made a mistake in opening its ranks to the weaker sex.</p><p>Of course, since most FBI agents were male, if you eliminated the weaker sex from the Bureau, there would be hardly any agents left. Kathryn bit her cheek against the urge to laugh at the inside joke, which reflected the opinion of pretty much every female agent she knew.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, Special Agent.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn sat. If this bastard tried to cancel her vacation leave, he\u2019d have far worse than a sexual harassment suit on his hands. Mayhem seemed likely. The man wouldn\u2019t have any hands left when she was done with him! Which was no more than exaggerated wishful thinking on her part. The truth was, if he cancelled her leave, she\u2019d grit her teeth and take it, because the only alternative was going AWOL, which would probably cost her her job. And she didn\u2019t want that. She\u2019d worked hard to get where she was. It was the only career she\u2019d ever truly desired, and she was the perfect cog in the giant Bureau machine. Always on time, always willing to work the extra hours, the weekends.</p><p>Maybe Eduardo was right. Maybe it was time she loosened up a little, broke free of her own rigid rules.</p><p>And that reminded her of why she\u2019d requested vacation leave. Her brother was the free soul of the family, and look where it had gotten him. Disappeared, missing . . . and . . . \u201cOh God,\u201d she pleaded silently, \u201cplease don\u2019t let anything terrible have happened to Dan.\u201d</p><p>Fielding cleared his throat, drawing Kathryn\u2019s attention back to the here and now. \u201cI hear things, Hunter,\u201d he said.</p><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be any response to that, so Kathryn waited.</p><p>\u201cI know your brother is missing. How long\u2019s it been now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly two weeks, sir,\u201d she confirmed, keeping her expression carefully blank, while wondering where he\u2019d heard about Dan\u2019s disappearance. Kathryn had been careful not to talk about her brother\u2019s situation, though she had made a few phone calls. From home, of course, so no one could accuse her of slacking off on the job. She\u2019d called the Sheriff in the small town where Dan had been staying while shooting in BadlandsNational Park, and might even have used her position as an FBI agent to set up an interview or two. That was assuming she could finally get her boss to approve some vacation time. Which was why she was sitting in Fielding\u2019s office right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fielding leaned forward, his brows coming together in a scowl. \u201cI sympathize with your situation, Hunter. But you cannot use your position, your authority as an FBI agent, to put pressure on or interfere with the local authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir!\u201d Kathryn hoped she sounded sufficiently shocked at the very thought of such a thing. \u201cMy brother is an artist, and something of a free spirit. He\u2019s done this before, dropping off the grid for weeks at a time.\u201d</p><p>What she didn\u2019t say was that while Dan might drop off the grid, he\u2019d never dropped off her personal grid for this long. She\u2019d dismissed Penny\u2019s initial hysterics over Dan\u2019s missed check-in. The woman was a frustrated actress and tended toward the dramatic in almost every situation. But when a week passed, and there was still no word, she\u2019d begun to worry. She and her brother had a system, and even when he missed his calls to Penny, he\u2019d never once failed to get a message out to Kathryn, somehow, some way. Until now.</p> <p>\u201cGood to hear.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded and hoped Fielding didn\u2019t get chatty and start asking about her vacation plans. She\u2019d hate to lie, but she would if he pushed her.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Fielding said, sitting back abruptly, as if suddenly aware that in leaning across the desk that way, he\u2019d gotten far too close to her for safety . . . his safety, that was, given his potent male charisma. \u201cEnjoy your vacation, Hunter.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stood immediately, as anxious to get out of his office as he was to have her gone.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d she said and managed to leave the office without once entertaining an improper sexual thought about SAC Fielding.</p> <p>Daniel Hunter struggled to sit up, his head pounding, eyes blurry, though it was hard to see anything in his prison. There was a ceiling light, but the switch was in the hallway just outside the locked door. His jailer turned it on when he brought food and water, or when he visited. The fucking freak.</p><p>Dan had no memory of how he\u2019d gotten here, didn\u2019t even know where here was. His last memory was of having a drink at the local bar. He\u2019d tried to piece it together and figured the freak must have drugged his drink. But why?</p><p>He leaned against the rough wall and tipped his head back to stare at the lone window, high above his head. It was tightly covered. He only knew whether it was day or night by the small spot of sunlight that squeezed through a hole in the corner sometimes. He\u2019d taken to ticking the days off by scratching a line on the plaster wall with a shard he\u2019d salvaged from the ceramic cup he\u2019d smashed on the first day. His jailer had picked up all the pieces, or so he\u2019d thought. But once he was gone, Dan had scrambled around on the floor feeling for any sharp bits left behind. It had felt like a victory when he\u2019d found the sharp wedge beneath the bed. And now, it was all he had, those lines on the wall, his small rebellion against captivity. That and the reminder that days were passing, that with every day that went by, his sister Kathryn was a little closer to finding him. And she\u2019d never give up until she did.</p><p>He sighed and tried to make himself more comfortable on the thin mattress. If the bastard was going to trap him here, the least he could do was provide a decent bed. Not for the first time, he wondered why he\u2019d been taken. Money was the obvious answer, but he was beginning to get a bad feeling about this setup. With every visit from his jailer, it felt a little more personal, a little more like an obsession. And that thought put him in mind of the great Stephen King book, Misery, and not in a good way. Although it brought back good memories, too. Dan and his sister had snuck away one Saturday to see the movie, and Kathy Bates had scared the shit out of them. He smiled, remembering, but the memory sobered him once again. Kathryn would be worried sick by now.</p><p>South Dakota</p><p>Kathryn glanced at the GPS and made a right turn, quickly spotting the Sheriff\u2019s Office down the block. She\u2019d gone directly from Quantico to the airport, her bag all packed and waiting for her in the trunk of her car. A late night flight had gotten her as far as Minneapolis, where she\u2019d spent the night in an airport hotel, catching a 6:00 a.m. puddle jumper into Spearfish, South Dakota, which was the nearest town of any size.</p> <p>She had her brother\u2019s itinerary. He always e-mailed it to her before he went on one of his trips, even though he insisted she didn\u2019t need to worry about him. But whom else did she have to worry about? Easy for SAC Fielding to tell her to leave the search for her brother to someone else. Fielding had a wife and three kids, not to mention a whole plethora of relatives, including two brothers, a sister and a backyard full of nieces, nephews and cousins. He\u2019d invited Kathryn to a barbeque one summer, along with a bunch of others from the office, and she\u2019d been amazed at the sheer number of blood relations.</p><p>She and Daniel only had each other. Although that wasn\u2019t completely accurate. Their father was still alive, but he had remarried and was engrossed in his new family. It wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d turned against Kathryn and her brother. She knew he still loved them, but she supposed he preferred to forget the tragedy of losing his first wife, their mother, to cancer when Dan was still a baby, and the hard work of raising the two of them mostly on his own. She couldn\u2019t blame him, really. It had been rough on all three of them. Fortunately, she and Dan remained close. They had each other, and that was all they\u2019d ever needed. Even as kids.</p><p>But because Dan was all she had, because she\u2019d all but raised him, the idea of standing by and waiting while someone else made desultory efforts to locate him wasn\u2019t even an option. She had to do this.</p><p>Kathryn parked in the small side parking lot of the Sheriff\u2019s office, noticing the number of SUVs and trucks alongside. She was glad she\u2019d upgraded to the midsize SUV instead of taking the standard 4-door sedan. It had been a dry winter in this part of the country, but dry was a relative term. They\u2019d had snow, just not as much of it, and spring had come early. Still, she was glad for the 4-wheel drive on the SUV. She drove a Jeep back home in Virginia, but the best the car rental could do was a Toyota Forerunner. It did the job, and at first glance, let her blend into the local scenery. She wanted a chance to look around before everyone started pointing at her and saying FBI, or at least cop. She\u2019d even made a point of wearing jeans and a black turtleneck for the flight into Spearfish this morning, trying to avoid standing out any more than necessary. But even so, she knew she had that FBI look about her\u2014a little too stiff, a little too conservative. A little too conservative in other ways, too, as the few men she\u2019d dated had been happy to point out. Too many of them had been excited by the idea of dating a gun-toting woman, and then been disappointed when she also turned out to have a brain and a will. She\u2019d only dated one guy, a homicide detective, who\u2019d actually accepted her for what she was, at least at first. But he\u2019d eventually moved on to some air-headed bimbo. Okay, that wasn\u2019t true. The bimbo was a pediatrician, and so probably wasn\u2019t an airhead. But she wasn\u2019t a cop either, and that had been the problem for her homicide detective. There\u2019d been too much shop talk and not enough of anything else between them.</p><p>She\u2019d pretty much given up on dating after that. Her vibrator had become her favorite companion, and Ben and Jerry her best friends. And she\u2019d buried herself in work. Until Daniel went missing.</p><p>Despite the patches of snow on the ground, it was warmer than she\u2019d expected when she climbed out the SUV. She left her heavy jacket in the truck and went with her standard FBI blue blazer over her sweater. She wore plain, black, flat-soled ankle boots for two reasons\u2014one, they were comfortable enough to run in, if necessary. (Forget Agent Scully\u2019s three-inch, blocky pumps. Never happened.) And the second reason was that at nearly six foot, Kathryn tended to be taller than a lot of men even without heels. The FBI was still largely a man\u2019s world, and too many of those men copped an immediate attitude if they had to look up at her. So she wore flat soles on the job. Of course, technically, she wasn\u2019t on the job today, but since she was about to defy SAC Fielding and use her FBI credentials to push the investigation, she figured she\u2019d better make a pass at looking the part.</p><p>The station door opened as she climbed the stairs. Two men in jeans, long-sleeved shirts and well-worn cowboy boots emerged. Kathryn sized them up automatically, noting height, weight, coloring. They looked alike, probably a father and son from their ages, with the older one well into his sixties. The younger one tipped his hat and held the door for her.</p><p>Kathryn smiled and hurried up the last step. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said and ducked past him and into the station.</p> <p>There were three plastic waiting chairs against the wall and a battered wooden counter with a skinny deputy at a desk on the other side. With his neatly trimmed brown hair and guileless brown eyes, the deputy looked all of eighteen, but Kathryn figured he had to be older. Although not by much. He glanced up as she approached.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Kathryn Hunter. I\u2019m looking for Sheriff Sutcliffe,\u201d Kathryn told him. \u201cI think he\u2019s expecting me.\u201d</p><p>The deputy didn\u2019t seem impressed. He eyed her carefully, then slowly picked up the desk phone and hit a number.</p><p>\u201cFBI\u2019s here to see you, Sheriff,\u201d he said unhurriedly.</p><p>Well, so much for blending in, Kathryn thought.</p><p>The deputy eyed her unblinkingly while he waited. \u201cYes, sir. Will do, sir.\u201d</p><p>He hung up the phone with deliberate movements, then, with all the speed of a sloth, stood, walked around the desk and over to the swinging door of the counter\u2019s pass through. Reaching beneath the counter, he hit a release of some sort. A buzzer sounded, followed by the click of a latch as the door nudged open. He stood there holding the button, listening to it buzz for a good ten seconds before he finally said to Kathryn, \u201cThe sheriff will see you.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn wanted to slap his hand away from the damn buzzer, but forced herself to bare her teeth in a semblance of a smile and push through the low, swinging gate. Sloth boy finally released the button and preceded her past several empty desks and down a short hallway where he stopped in front of a closed door. The top half of the door was frosted glass, and the name \u201cSheriff Max Sutcliffe\u201d had been stenciled in gold lettering. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The deputy knocked three times on the wooden frame, pausing between each one. Kathryn blinked, hoping she wouldn\u2019t fall asleep while waiting.</p><p>\u201cGet in here, Henry,\u201d a voice barked impatiently from behind the door. Clearly the sheriff shared Kathryn\u2019s sentiments regarding his deputy.</p><p>Henry opened the door, and Kathryn scooted past him politely, but determinedly.</p> <p>\u201cSheriff Sutcliffe,\u201d she said, crossing to the desk and holding out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Kathryn Hunter. We spoke on the phone.\u201d</p><p>Sutcliffe was already standing by the time she reached the desk. His gaze did a quick up and down appraisal, and she saw the slight flare of appreciation in his eyes. Kathryn was used to the reaction and didn\u2019t comment. Some men, too many men, automatically assumed any woman in law enforcement would be either ugly or a lesbian. Or both. The opposite couldn\u2019t be more true. Not to mention the fact that most of the lesbians she knew were pretty damn good looking. But she wasn\u2019t here to correct the sheriff\u2019s perceptions about FBI agents, lesbians, or anyone else. She had one purpose, and that was to find her brother. For which she needed the cooperation of this man.</p><p>\u201cMs. Hunter,\u201d Sutcliffe said, holding her hand just a little too long. She noted the absence of her proper title and let it pass. \u201cA pleasure,\u201d he continued. \u201cPlease sit. Close the door, Henry,\u201d he ordered, looking over the top of a pair of reading glasses, which he quickly slipped off and tucked into his shirt pocket. He waited until the door closed before sitting down again.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Ms. Hunter? Would you like some coffee? Water? I\u2019ve got it here, so you don\u2019t need to worry about waiting on old Henry out there.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn chuckled dutifully at the comment, but shook her head. \u201cNo, thank you, Sheriff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall me Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d she corrected, then added, \u201cand I\u2019m Kathryn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathryn. Beautiful name. My mother\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy great-grandmother\u2019s too,\u201d she commented with a smile, then sat on the edge of the wooden chair in front of his desk and pulled a small notepad from the inside pocket of her jacket. She still took written notes when interviewing people, no matter the case. The FBI\u2019s policy on recording interviews and confessions was inconsistent and more complicated than it needed to be. It was easier to assume that recording wouldn\u2019t be permitted. Later on, she\u2019d transfer it all to her laptop anyway, and if a recording was made available, it was a nice bonus. But this way she always had her written notes to fall back on. Kathryn flipped open her notepad. She\u2019d already marked the page containing her notes on Daniel\u2019s disappearance, so she didn\u2019t have to search for it.</p><p>\u201cAs you know, Max,\u201d she started, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to track down a photographer who went missing around here a couple of weeks back.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cDaniel Hunter,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cYour brother, if I\u2019m not mistaken,\u201d he added with a smug look.</p> <p>Kathryn wasn\u2019t surprised he\u2019d made the connection, even though she hadn\u2019t mentioned it to him. Hunter was a common enough last name, after all. But what she knew of Max Sutcliffe already told her not to underestimate him, so she didn\u2019t bother denying it, either.</p><p>\u201cMy younger brother, and only sibling, as it happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you where he was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan sent me his itinerary, including flights and hotel, which is his usual routine when traveling. I\u2019m based out of Quantico, and Dan lives in California, so we don\u2019t see each other as often as we\u2019d like, but we\u2019re close and stay in touch by phone and computer whenever possible. What I know, Max, is that my brother has never, and I mean never in the ten years we\u2019ve lived apart, disappeared like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, Kathryn. I don\u2019t care how close you are, there\u2019s all sorts of things a man wouldn\u2019t want to share with his sister,\u201d he said, suddenly seeming uncomfortable with the direction of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. But not this. A couple days, even a week, I could buy. But Dan wouldn\u2019t go this long without getting in touch. He knows I\u2019d worry, and he knows what I do for a living. He wouldn\u2019t want me calling out the troops if he was just off on a romantic fling,\u201d she finished with a smile that she hoped didn\u2019t look as forced as it felt.</p><p>\u201cI believe you, or at least I believe you believe it. And I\u2019ve checked around some since we spoke last. Last time anyone saw him was at a private club over in Spearfish.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn looked up in surprise. This was new. \u201cA private club? What kind of a private club?\u201d</p> <p>Max squirmed uncomfortably, and Kathryn felt a depressing sense of inevitability. Her brother was openly gay, and she had a feeling Max was one of those people who weren\u2019t comfortable discussing\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of those vampire things,\u201d Max finally said in disgust.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s dismay was replaced by shame that she\u2019d assumed the other. Max\u2019s unease was apparently focused on vampires, not sexuality. And the vampire connection wasn\u2019t a complete surprise to her. The last time she\u2019d spoken to Daniel, he\u2019d mentioned meeting a vampire or two, and said something about a party, which might be the same as the private club Max was talking about. In fact, it was her brother\u2019s comment about the local vampires that had motivated her to set up an interview with the local vampire honcho. Max\u2019s information only made that interview more important.</p><p>\u201cIn the last conversation I had with Dan, he mentioned meeting some vampires,\u201d she told the sheriff. \u201cI actually have an appointment to meet with . . .\u201d She checked her notes. \u201c. . . Lucas Donlon later tonight. I understand he\u2019s leader of the local vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord,\u201d Max said sourly. \u201cHe\u2019s not a bad sort, but he does title himself a vampire lord. His people even call him Lord Donlon, like this was the Middle Ages or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that title also. Not about Donlon, but a couple of others. Vamps tend to lie pretty low usually, but the FBI does have some information on them. Mostly from the one or two who live more in the public eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Max said glumly, \u201cwhen I first became sheriff, I ran a check on Donlon and any of his people I could get names for. They don\u2019t have so much as a traffic ticket in South Dakota. Leastways, not that I could find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrests aren\u2019t common,\u201d Kathryn agreed, \u201cbut when they do happen, the lawyers come out, and it goes away. These vampire lords seem to have plenty of money, and they\u2019re not afraid to spend it on the right lawyers and politicians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should they be different than any other rich asshole, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. Should be interesting, though, to see how Mister Donlon responds to an FBI investigation, which is quite a bit more serious than a traffic ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you well with that,\u201d Max said, but with so little enthusiasm that she didn\u2019t find it very encouraging. \u201cYou got a navigation system in that SUV you rented?\u201d Kathryn nodded, and he continued, \u201cYou\u2019ll want to use it going out there after dark. You\u2019ll never find it otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I will. Back to Daniel\u2019s last known whereabouts. I know he planned to do some backcountry camping in the Badlands, but he frequently goes off on his own when he\u2019s working, and he\u2019s an experienced camper.\u201d</p><p>Max opened a drawer, pulled out a full-color brochure of the Badlands, and handed it across the desk. \u201cOrdinarily, something like this, I\u2019d assume he was just another lost camper. There aren\u2019t too many trails in the park, and it\u2019s easy to get turned around, or injured. But I spoke to the rangers at the visitor center. They confirmed that Daniel Hunter stopped to check in with them on his way into the backcountry, and then again when he was leaving the park. And they haven\u2019t seen him since. It makes sense that if he bothered to check in the first time he set out, he\u2019d do it again if he was going back for more. So I\u2019m assuming whatever happened to him, it didn\u2019t happen in the park. Leastways, not in the backcountry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I talked to the rangers myself?\u201d It was a courtesy question. She didn\u2019t need his permission, but his cooperation would be helpful.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Max said readily. \u201cIt\u2019s the BenReifelVisitorCenter in the Park Headquarters out on highway two-forty. There\u2019s a small map in that brochure, and road signs will show you the way, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. And what about the witness who saw him leaving the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, that one\u2019s more complicated. He just left on his third tour of Afghanistan two days ago. But I record everything on video these days, more for our protection than theirs, so I can give you a copy of that.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn wanted to scream in frustration. Two days! She\u2019d missed interviewing possibly the last person to see her brother by two measly days! She felt something digging into her fingers and looked down to see her hand gripping the pen so tightly that her fingers were bloodless. She forced her hand to relax and dug up a smile for Max.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate that, Sheriff,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cA flash drive would be great if you have it. Or a DVD, if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. Computers and I don\u2019t exactly get along. Henry handles all that. I did ask him to make you a copy this morning, so we\u2019ll see what he came up with. He ought to about have it ready by now,\u201d he added dryly.</p><p>Kathryn took the hint and stood. \u201cThank you for all your help, Sheriff. If I come across anything else, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll do the same on this end. If you need anything at all, you just give me a call. I\u2019m either here or reachable by cell phone pretty much seven days a week.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stopped on her way out and picked up a flash drive from Henry. Once back in the SUV, she stowed it in her briefcase to play later. Right now, she wanted to get out to the visitor center at the park. She had little doubt they\u2019d have nothing more to tell her than what they\u2019d already told Max, but she needed to do this her way, and that meant checking off each item personally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She did a quick search on her laptop, piggybacking onto the Wi-Fi from the small cyber-caf\u00e9 and sandwich shop across the way. Locating the BenReifelVisitorCenter, she studied the map, then shut it down without bothering with the nav system.</p><p>As Max had told her, getting to the park headquarters and visitor center was pretty much a no-brainer. There were signs everywhere and not much in between. Less than an hour later, she was pulling into the parking lot. There were no other cars, just a couple of official pickup trucks. Despite the cool weather, it seemed this wasn\u2019t the park\u2019s busy season. Most people tended to take their vacations in summer, when the kids were out of school. Even the people who didn\u2019t have any kids in school. It made more sense to her to travel when places were less crowded, but maybe that was because she\u2019d never taken a summer vacation as a child, and so had no preconceived notion of what a vacation was supposed to be. The closest she and her brother had come to a vacation were the summers spent on their maternal grandparents\u2019 farm. But then their grandparents had died within a year of each other when she was only twelve, and that ended that. Nonetheless, her time with them made up some of her fondest childhood memories.</p><p>Kathryn shook herself back to the present. She had no time for memory lane. The visitor center was a typical national park building, a plain single story structure with a concrete walk out front. The interior had the usual displays and dioramas of the park\u2019s history, with racks of brochures for free, and a few glossy books and touristy souvenirs for sale. Kathryn looked them over, thinking about what Daniel had told her in explaining why he\u2019d chosen the Badlands for his next project. He\u2019d said he\u2019d seen a brochure at a friend\u2019s party and had known he could do better. She picked up the free visitor\u2019s brochure which was identical to the one Max Sutcliffe had given her. She wondered if it was also the one that had brought her brother all this way from San Francisco.</p> <p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn turned to find a young woman with long, brown hair pulled back into a neat ponytail and brown eyes with just a touch of mascara. Her face was makeup free, clean and pink-cheeked, as if she spent a lot of time outdoors. The name Belinda was stitched over the pocket of a neatly pressed U.S. Park Service uniform.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Kathryn Hunter, FBI,\u201d she said, flashing her credentials and hoping none of this ever came back to bite her in the ass.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d the young woman said, frowning a little. \u201cSheriff Sutcliffe said you\u2019d be coming. You\u2019re Daniel\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn blinked. \u201cI am, yes. You remember my brother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe went backcountry twice, and I spoke with him before and after the second trip,\u201d Belinda said, but her already pink cheeks had gone even redder.</p><p>Kathryn smiled at the woman\u2019s reaction. Her brother was charming and charismatic, and had a way of making people believe he really cared. And sometimes he did, even if it was only for the ten minutes he was talking to you.</p><p>\u201cSo, how does that work exactly?\u201d Kathryn asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s supposed to check in with us before they head into the backcountry, although, of course, not everyone does. We try to make sure people know what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s very rough out there in any weather, and hikers are completely on their own. I was a little concerned when I saw Dan was going solo, but after talking with him . . . well, it was obvious that he was an experienced hiker, and he was well-supplied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019d already been out and back once by the time you talked to him, right?\u201d</p><p>Belinda nodded. \u201cHe went out twice for ten days each time. That\u2019s a long while to be out there alone, but the time I saw him come back through, he seemed fine. Better than fine, actually. Exhilarated. A little tired maybe, and ready for a shower, but when he left, he said he just wanted a few days of hot running water and good food, and he\u2019d be coming back again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was healthy? I mean, no obvious injuries, limping, bandages, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Belinda said, frowning and shaking her head. \u201cLike I said, a little tired, but other than that, he actually seemed happier than when he went out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only saw him come back the once?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. \u201cThe last time he was here. That\u2019s why Sheriff Sutcliffe said you\u2019d want to interview me, because I was the last person he talked to here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Dan check in with you guys the first time he went out, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I wasn\u2019t here. That\u2019d be Cody Pilarski. We rotate shifts so there\u2019s always someone here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re sure it was Dan\u2019s last trip when you talked to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. And I sure hope nothing\u2019s happened to him. He was a really nice guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is a really nice guy,\u201d she corrected, emphasizing the verb. Her brother might be missing, but he was still alive. She knew it in her gut. Something terrible had happened, but not the worst. Not yet. And not ever if she had anything to say about it.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said to Belinda. She turned over one of her official business cards and wrote her personal cell number on it. \u201cIf you hear anything, or if anyone mentions seeing Daniel, please give me a call.\u201d</p><p>Belinda took the card, glanced down at it briefly, then tucked it into her breast pocket right under her name. \u201cI\u2019ll do that, Agent Hunter. I sure hope nothing\u2019s happened to him,\u201d she repeated, half to herself.</p><p>Kathryn nodded absently as she turned away, her mind already on her next task, the next item she had to check off her list. Everything Belinda had told her coincided with what she knew. Dan had actually called her when he emerged from the backcountry. He\u2019d left a message on her voicemail, telling her he was all right, that he was going to enjoy a few days of civilization and head back.</p><p>When Penny had first called her, saying Dan had missed his regular check-in, the first thing she\u2019d done was access his phone records. Since he traveled to a lot of places where cell service was spotty, he always carried a satellite phone with him, which enabled him to make calls without being within range of the town\u2019s cell tower. She found only one other call after the one Dan had made to her, and that was to Penelope in San Francisco. Unfortunately, Dan also had a tendency to pick up a disposable phone whenever he was in range of a cell signal, using that and then throwing it away, instead of carrying around the more expensive, and heavier, satellite phone. So while Kathryn knew when he\u2019d called her and Penny, she had no way of knowing whom else he might have called locally.</p><p>On the one hand, it was good to know that her brother had been well and happy when he\u2019d left the park two weeks ago. But on the other hand, so far she hadn\u2019t learned anything she didn\u2019t already know.</p><p>She beeped the locks on her rental SUV, opened the door, and then just stood there for a moment, leaning her forehead on the warm metal of the door frame. Her chest ached, and tears threatened as she fought off a wave of despair. If she could find even one clue, a single hint that would tell her what had happened . . . she needed a direction, and she didn\u2019t have it.</p><p>The slam of a truck door behind her had her straightening, blinking away the tears. She turned quickly, afraid someone might have seen her. But there was only a flash of khaki as one of the rangers disappeared through the side door of the visitor center.</p><p>Kathryn drew a deep breath and slid into the driver\u2019s seat, surreptitiously wiping away the few tears. She pulled over her laptop and checked the list she\u2019d already memorized. Next stop was the motel where Dan had stayed. His room was still there, still racking up nightly charges. She\u2019d assured the motel manager on the phone that she would pay for it, although she suspected the motel was pretty empty this time of year anyway. But she didn\u2019t care about the money. She\u2019d just wanted to be sure Dan\u2019s things were left untouched. Maybe that was where she\u2019d find that one clue she was looking for.</p><p>The motel was the only one in town\u2014flat-roofed, one story, and without a single identifying characteristic. Even its color was a boring beige that blended so well into the desert one could probably miss the building entirely on a hot day, with the heat rippling the air. It was a long step down from the type of hotel her brother usually stayed in, although, as with the backcountry camping, Daniel was more than willing to rough it to get the shot he wanted.</p><p>Kathryn parked in front of the office and went inside. The day manager\u2019s name was Jason Kenton.</p><p>\u201cMister Kenton,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m Kathryn Hunter. We spoke on the phone.\u201d She didn\u2019t use her FBI ID for this one. She was already feeling guilty about that, and it wasn\u2019t necessary in this case since she was paying the bill.</p><p>\u201cDaniel\u2019s sister,\u201d Kenton said, looking up from a cluttered desk behind the check-in counter. He looked groggy, as if she\u2019d woken him from a nap. He stood slowly, stretching out his muscles and yawning without any attempt to conceal it. Kathryn waited impatiently until he finally strolled across the six feet separating them and reached for a key hanging on a numbered board.</p><p>\u201cHis things are all in there, just like you asked. I haven\u2019t even let the maid clean. Didn\u2019t see much point, and I didn\u2019t want to mess anything up, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Kathryn said, smiling as she took the key. \u201cI\u2019ll be staying a few days, so I might as well use the room, if that\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>Kenton shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re paying the bill. Don\u2019t matter to me who sleeps there, as long as there\u2019s nothing funny goin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn blinked, trying to imagine what sort of funny he had in mind. But her brain was too tired. \u201cNothing funny,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYou ran my card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. No problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks again.\u201d She backed out of the door, feeling suddenly awkward, as if he expected her to stay and talk a while. Or maybe he\u2019d expected her to question him like they did in all the television shows. Whatever it was, she didn\u2019t have the energy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She climbed into the SUV and backed down the empty parking lot to room 18. It was an end unit, but other than that it was exactly the same as every other one. She thought Daniel might have requested the end, hoping for a little more privacy and quiet, but like everything else in this case, she was just guessing.</p><p>Her only suitcase was a small, rolling overnighter, so she grabbed it, then locked up the truck and let herself in. She was immediately swamped by a sense of loss. The room was a mess, with dirty clothes tossed haphazardly into an open suitcase on one of the double beds, and still lying on the floor where Daniel had left them. She knew they were dirty, because his clean clothes were all neatly hung in the closet. This was so typical of her brother that it brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>She glanced around, noting that among the dirty clothes were some obvious pieces of hiking gear. The single chair held Dan\u2019s backpack, which appeared deflated and forlorn. His well-worn hiking boots, some really dirty pants and T-shirts, and several pairs of thick socks lay in a pile on the floor next to it. One thing Daniel had always told her was that he never stinted on clean socks when he was hiking. Everything else could be stiff with dirt, but he always took several pairs of socks.</p> <p>She frowned, then stepped farther into the room and saw his camera equipment neatly stacked between the second bed and the wall, where it wouldn\u2019t be obvious to someone standing in the doorway. Dan\u2019s cameras were worth a small fortune, but even more than that, he\u2019d told her they were irreplaceable. Not because he couldn\u2019t buy another one, but because over time a photographer\u2019s camera became a part of him, as if the physical characteristics of the equipment mutated with use to become unique to the photographer.</p><p>She dropped her things on the bed and crouched down next to the pile of equipment. She couldn\u2019t tell if anything was missing. Maybe his agent Penny would have been able to, but she wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>Kathryn went to stand and had to grab the wall when the room spun around her. She was beyond tired. She\u2019d slept very little in the last two weeks, too worried about Dan. And then there\u2019d been the flight yesterday\u2014she could never sleep on planes\u2014and the sleepless night in Minneapolis waiting for the morning so she could get here and start looking for him.</p><p>She sighed and began stripping off her clothes. The jacket came first, then her badge and her gun, which was the FBI standard issue .40 caliber Glock 23. She set both badge and gun on the table, placed her spare magazine next to the gun, then snapped her holster from her belt and threw it on the other bed on top of her jacket. Stepping out of her shoes, she left them where they were and skimmed off her jeans. She was about to toss them on the bed, then thought better of it and folded them instead. She hadn\u2019t brought that many clothes with her. Knowing she\u2019d be more comfortable wearing her usual work attire later tonight for the interview with Donlon, she pulled her slacks and blouse out of her case and hung them up in the closet, hoping to get rid of any wrinkles. She hated ironing, but didn\u2019t want to present herself to Lucas Donlon looking like she\u2019d slept on a plane, either.</p><p>Picking up her jacket and shoes, she shuffled over to the closet, dropped her shoes on the floor and hung up the jacket next to the pants and blouse. She eyed the bed warily, then yanked the bedspread down, piling it on the floor. She never slept on those things. They were crawling with bacteria. She was tired, but her mind was racing, and she knew she\u2019d have to check out the witness interview from Sheriff Sutcliffe before she\u2019d be able to sleep. Her knees sank into the too soft mattress as she dragged her laptop over and inserted the flash drive. She watched it all the way through, intending to go back and make notes on a second viewing. But when she reached across for her notepad and pen, her head spun dizzily. She put her head on the pillow, intending to close her eyes for only a moment. She registered that the sheets were surprisingly fresh and clean when she pulled them up to her chin. And that was it.</p> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>Minneapolis, Minnesota</p><p>Lucas opened his eyes and stifled the immediate desire to groan. He was in Minneapolis. Not that this was a bad thing in itself. The Twin Cities were exciting and vibrant, and he maintained a residence here, which he visited several times a year. So, it wasn\u2019t that he minded being in Minneapolis that made him swear with his first waking breath. It was the knowledge that he had to rush back to the ranch in South Dakota, because some damn FBI woman was coming to visit him tonight.</p><p>Visit. Huh. Interrogate was probably more like it. Lucas had never met a cop he trusted, and he\u2019d met a lot of cops. He also admitted that this prejudice might have something to do with his misspent youth on the streets of Dublin and London, but that didn\u2019t change the fact of the matter. Especially not when it came to cops and vampires. The people in charge never liked it when someone else was more powerful than they were. There was a level of distrust between vampires and the human authorities that would never go away, and he didn\u2019t see that changing between now and later tonight when the FBI invaded his ranch.</p><p>A hot shower dispelled much of his bad mood, as did the memory of their successful hunt last night. He was standing in front of his closet, trying to decide whether to go with a business look for the FBI, or stick with jeans and leather, when his cell phone rang. He reached out and picked it up without looking.</p><p>\u201cYo, Nicholas,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d his lieutenant responded. \u201cI just spoke to Magda. Klemens called your private line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t pick up,\u201d Lucas confirmed. None of his people were allowed to pick up that line as long as he was alive to do it.</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord. But when you didn\u2019t answer, he called the business number, and Magda told him you were unavailable. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d He was interrupted by the incoming call signal. He pulled the cell phone away from his ear long enough to check the caller ID and then said to Nicholas, \u201cSpeak of the devil, and he will surely appear. Klemens is on call waiting. I\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d Lucas switched over to the incoming call with the flick of a finger. Modern technology was a marvelous thing!</p><p>\u201cKlemens, old chap, what can I do for you? Or more to the point . . . to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, you fucking Irish gutter rat. Who the hell do you think you are taking out a house on my fucking territory!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour territory? I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I disciplined one of my vampires last night, along with his fellow traitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of those vampires you killed were mine, and you know it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo of yours? How sad. Well, as my dear old Gran used to say, if you lie down with dogs, boyo, you\u2019ll surely get fleas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fucking Gran was a pox-riddled whore on the streets of Dublin.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed. \u201cQuite right, Klemens. I had no idea you\u2019d met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to that useless country of yours and never will. It\u2019s full of thieves and drunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the thieves are drunk, too!\u201d Lucas agreed cheerfully. \u201cAh, good times. But I don\u2019t think you called to stroll down memory lane with me. So the house was yours? Things get a little muddled that close to the border. And speaking of borders . . .\u201d he added, as if it had just occurred to him. \u201cRaphael is quite vexed with you, I\u2019m afraid. Apparently you took a shot at him, and in Colorado, no less. Terribly bold, Klemens. Hitting Raphael on his own territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop babbling, you fool. I had nothing to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you have heard about it. From whom, I wonder? I\u2019m sure Raphael would dearly love to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what that bastard wants. If someone took a shot at him, more power to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Lucas commiserated. \u201cThe sniper missed rather handily, and, from what I hear, he\u2019s no longer among the living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to believe Raphael shares that kind of information with the likes of you? You can\u2019t be trusted to keep your own secrets, much less anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but since Raphael is convinced you were behind the hit, we\u2019ve become quite close. The enemy of my enemy, you know.\u201d</p><p>Lucas could hear Klemens breathing hard, either trying to control his famous temper, or trolling through his thick brain for something clever to say.</p><p>\u201cIn any event,\u201d Lucas said, continuing the conversation, such as it was, \u201cif the house was yours, I did you a service by burning it to the ground. It was quite bloody when we finished. And there was dust everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the end, Donlon,\u201d Klemens snarled.</p><p>Lucas dropped his guise of humor, his voice hard when he said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. This is just beginning.\u201d He disconnected, not waiting to hear what would no doubt have been some obscenity-laced threat from Klemens. He punched up Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes, Nicholas, and we\u2019re out of here.\u201d He threw the phone down and pulled on a pair of worn and comfortable denims. He was in no mood to play nice for the fucking FBI.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>South Dakota</p><p>Kathryn swore as she missed her exit on I-90. She took the next off-ramp, doubled back and took the correct exit as her GPS began recalculating for her mistake. Sheriff Sutcliffe had been right. Lucas Donlon had an address, but not much of one. She frowned as the nice GPS lady told her to take the next right turn. She slowed, eyeing the unpaved road that presented itself. There were no lights out here, just her headlights and the full moon, which was barely peeking over the mountains. And there was a lot more snow on the ground, big clumps of it piled against boulders and beneath the trees. The so-called road was two strips of dirt, visible only because they were paler than the rough fields of grass and ice-pocked rock that surrounded them. But it had to be reasonably well traveled, or the two strips wouldn\u2019t be worn away at all. Sutcliffe had also warned her that Donlon didn\u2019t welcome visitors. Maybe leaving this unpaved was his way of discouraging people.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, Kathryn wasn\u2019t going to be put off by a little rough road. She switched on her high beams and made the turn. A quarter of a mile later, she was having second thoughts. The other reason she\u2019d chosen to rent a 4-wheel drive SUV was because she\u2019d assumed that, in this part of the country, there would be the occasional dirt road to travel. But even then, she hadn\u2019t counted on driving down dirt trails carved through unlit, half-frozen fields of knee-high grass and unfriendly looking trees. What sane person intentionally left the main road to his residence in such a dangerous condition? Especially since most of the traffic out here was probably after dark? Even a vampire had to leave his ranch eventually, and he\u2019d have to take this road, too. The myth that vampires could fly was just that\u2014a myth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And what about his employees? There must be somebody who worked for him. They\u2019d have to navigate this impossible thing every day! Her car hit two potholes in a row, one right after the other, nearly jerking the steering wheel out of her hands. She growled beneath her breath, keeping up a steady stream of muttered curses. She should report the bastard to OSHA. Serve him right. Maybe he didn\u2019t worry about the FBI, but he\u2019d sure as hell worry about the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The sheer volume of paperwork they\u2019d demand would make Donlon\u2019s life a living hell. She grinned at the thought, then hit a new pothole and swore, \u201cStupid damn . . . oh.\u201d</p><p>With no warning, the road evened out, becoming smooth as silk, her tires virtually humming over the hard surface. She loosened her grip on the wheel, shaking out her hands to restore circulation, feeling the nerves in her fingers and arms still vibrating after\u2014she checked her GPS\u2014only five miles of that tortuous road? It had seemed much farther than that.</p><p>But it was behind her now, and she was making good time on what the nav system told her was the last leg before her destination. She saw a flash of white in the distance as the road rose briefly before dipping into a deep ravine. When she came up the other side, a white rail fence was paralleling the road, and about a mile farther on, there was a white arching gate with a name stenciled overhead.</p> <p>Kathryn slowed and made a right turn that took her through the open gate. Looking up, she saw that it wasn\u2019t a name on the wooden arch above her, but a stylized D. The kind one associated with livestock brands, although she was fairly certain they didn\u2019t brand animals anymore. She seemed to remember seeing a report on TV, or maybe it was the Internet, about how ranchers had gone to something more technological, like implanted data chips or something. If the vampire had herd stock, maybe she\u2019d ask him about it. Although she found it unlikely that a vampire would actually raise cattle. A sudden thought struck her, and she frowned. Could a vampire exist on animal blood?</p><p>She shook off the unpleasant image that question conjured, and focused on the road in front of her, which wasn\u2019t at all a straight line. It looped around stands of trees and grassy humps, many of which had piles of jagged boulders buried on their hillsides. In the far distance, silhouetted by the pale moon, was the sharp peak of LookoutMountain, which she recognized from the research she\u2019d done online.</p><p>After a mile or so, another open arch appeared over the road, but this one was sturdier, made of beautiful river rock with wood accents. That same stylized D was worked into the wood. Jeez, maybe the guy was afraid he\u2019d forget his name unless someone reminded him at every turn.</p><p>A stone wall angled out to either side of the entrance, tapering down to a low decorative border before it disappeared altogether in the deep grass. Two figures appeared beneath the arch as soon as her headlights splashed over its surface. They stood in the roadway, blocking her access. From their formidable size, she assumed they were male. One was a bit taller than the other\u2014six-foot-two to his buddy\u2019s five-nine\u2014but they were both heavily muscled and moved with an economy of effort that told her they had some training. Obviously, this was Donlon\u2019s security, although that was some serious heft for gate guards. And they weren\u2019t relying on muscle alone, either. Both men were carrying what, from a distance, looked like H-K MP5 submachine guns on combat slings over their chests, and she wondered if they were licensed to carry that kind of weapon. South Dakota had some very liberal gun laws, but she didn\u2019t know if they included the personal use of submachine guns.</p><p>Not that this was her problem. She wasn\u2019t even here on official FBI business, much less anything else. She\u2019d come here to interview a vampire. She snickered as she thought the words and only hoped her subject looked like Brad Pitt.</p> <p>Focus, Kathryn!</p><p>She wished someone had interviewed Lucas Donlon, or any of the vampire lords. There had been scattered pieces here and there on the Internet, mostly blogs devoted to the paranormal genre. But even those gave away very little about the vampires themselves. She supposed living hundreds of years made one an expert at deflecting questions from nosy interviewers, especially given man\u2019s violent history toward things he didn\u2019t understand. But the sum total of what she\u2019d been able to uncover about vampires\u2014and she\u2019d had a lot of places to look, given her job access\u2014was very little.</p><p>Vampires were almost a nation within a nation. They policed their own people, and from what she\u2019d been able to find out, tolerated no dissent. And as long as they didn\u2019t cause any problems, like littering the streets with bloody bodies, the human authorities didn\u2019t seem to mind. At least no one complained. The vampires even had a new ambassador of sorts in Washington, D.C., Duncan Milford. He was more of a lobbyist than an ambassador, representing vampire interests in the halls of Congress. It was the public information on Duncan more than any other that had given her most of what she knew.</p><p>As far as the local vampire bar, the one where her brother had been seen last, the witness, who was now out of touch in Afghanistan, claimed to have seen her brother speaking to a known vampire. He also thought they\u2019d left together, although he hadn\u2019t personally witnessed that part of the evening. He had seen them walk out the front door, but since he\u2019d been inside the club, he couldn\u2019t verify what had happened outside. He was, however, certain that the person with Daniel was a vampire, because he\u2019d been to the club before, and apparently it was pretty obvious who was and wasn\u2019t. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have a name. Sheriff Sutcliffe\u2019s report had gone on to say that there was one more witness who claimed he\u2019d seen Daniel leave the bar with the vamp, but his report was questionable. He\u2019d admitted to being drunk at the time, so drunk that he had no memory of his own actions later that night.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t much to go on, but it was all Kathryn had. So, vampire honcho or not, Donlon was going to give her some answers.</p><p>Lucas strode into his office, still pissed that he\u2019d been forced to rush back here for the convenience of the FBI. He slumped down into the chair behind his desk and watched sullenly as Nicholas called Magda for a situation report.</p> <p>\u201cTalk to me, gorgeous,\u201d Nicholas said, then listened as Magda talked. He laughed abruptly. \u201cNot happy, I can tell you that. Okay, see you in a few.\u201d He disconnected and regarded Lucas warily.</p><p>\u201cThe FBI has landed, my lord,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way up to the house as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Lucas looked away, thinking. \u201cDid Magda see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but she got a report from Kofi at the checkpoint. He says she\u2019s right proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear that limey bastard just says stuff like that to piss me off.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled. \u201cI believe he means she\u2019s buttoned up tight, stick up her butt, by the rules . . . Shall I go on, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck. I know what it means. I suppose I have to meet with her.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas gave him a disbelieving look. \u201cI thought that\u2019s why we rushed back here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, I know. All right.\u201d Lucas tapped one finger on the arm of his chair. \u201cHave Magda meet her and bring her in. Tell her to take it slow, sit and chat a bit. And tell Maggie to play it human. Maybe our FBI visitor will give something away if she thinks she\u2019s speaking to a sympathetic ear.\u201d</p><p>Nick dipped his head briefly. \u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, Nick.\u201d Nicholas stopped in the doorway, looking back. \u201cMake sure you come back. I want you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that. I\u2019m not suffering alone.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn braked to a stop with the front end of her SUV just beneath the arch of the stone gate. It was either that or run over the big guy standing in the middle of the road glowering at her. And his finger looked a mite too twitchy on the trigger for her peace of mind. She caught movement in her side mirror. The second guard had circled around her vehicle and was coming up on the driver\u2019s side from the back. Probably hoping to surprise her, maybe watch her jump when he tapped on her window unexpectedly. Not gonna happen.</p><p>She hit the button and had her window already sliding down before he could go for it. He gave her a sour look, as if maybe she\u2019d spoiled his fun. Like she cared. She flashed her FBI credentials. \u201cSpecial Agent Kathryn Hunter,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe Mister Donlon is expecting me.\u201d</p><p>The guard studied her silently for a moment, and she studied him back. Black male, shaved head, brown eyes, and she\u2019d been right about the height and weight. About the muscles, too. Not an ounce of fat. He was still staring.</p><p>If he thought to unnerve her with his sphinx act, he was going to be disappointed. She could stare at him all night. She wondered if he was a vampire. She\u2019d never seen one before. They were notoriously camera shy. Even Duncan. He was making the rounds of Capital makers and shakers, partying with the best of them, but while his name was frequently mentioned, she\u2019d never seen a photograph of him. And it wasn\u2019t because of that old superstition about vampires not appearing in mirrors and, by extension, cameras, either. That was just stupid. Simple physics said if a body occupied mass, it interacted with the universe in predictable ways, including mirrors. No, he was simply one step ahead of the photographers, that\u2019s all.</p><p>Nope, vampires lived and breathed just like everyone else. Although, maybe not quite like everyone else, since they certainly lived a hell of a lot longer.</p><p>The sphinx was still staring. She was about to say something when the big guy in front of the car beat her to it.</p><p>\u201cBoss is waiting, Kofi,\u201d he called.</p><p>A flash of irritation crossed her guard\u2019s face before he smiled . . . and displayed two very long, wicked-looking fangs. Kathryn almost groaned out loud. Please. Did he think that was going to put her off? Was she supposed to shriek and race away in her little SUV, never to darken his archway again?</p><p>Kathryn bared her teeth back at him in a perfect smile that was the product of four miserable years of braces as a teenager.</p><p>The sphinx finally grunted and stepped back, nodding at his buddy to do the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Kathryn said politely. She buzzed her window up, more against the dust from the road than the cold, and continued toward the house. A glance in her rearview mirror showed the sphinx on a cell phone. Probably warning his boss that she was on her way. Good. If they were ready for her, she wouldn\u2019t have to waste time waiting.</p><p>The road very quickly entered a patch of trees that combined pine trees and a bunch of others. Kathryn didn\u2019t know trees. Anything that resembled a Christmas tree was pine, and everything else was just a tree. Good enough.</p><p>It was even darker once she passed under the thick branches. She was tempted to flip on her brights, but figured she\u2019d only be turning them off soon enough. And she didn\u2019t want to show any kind of weakness or fear, especially not of something as straightforward as a little bit of heavy shadow.</p> <p>The trees thinned out, and the road straightened. A white rail fence appeared on her right, and she recognized the enclosure as a paddock. It was dark at this end, but there was a well-lit structure in the near distance with more white-fenced enclosures. And in the one closest to the barn, she could see . . . horses. She blinked, not quite believing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d she muttered. \u201cA cowboy vampire? Like I believe that.\u201d</p><p>As she drew closer, it was obvious the horses were well cared for and well-bred. These weren\u2019t family pets but expensive animals. Was someone training them? Or maybe breeding? Was horse breeding profitable? She wouldn\u2019t have thought so, but she\u2019d have to look it up. She hadn\u2019t found anything in her research to indicate Lucas Donlon was breeding livestock, but that didn\u2019t mean anything. As far as she knew, she was the first federal agent of any kind who\u2019d made it this far. She slowed slightly as she drew even with the paddock. The brightly-lit structure was a horse barn, with a long aisle down the middle and stalls on either side. It all looked very tidy . . . and very expensive.</p><p>Kathryn felt the weight of someone staring at her. She turned her head sharply toward the far end of the paddock and saw that it wasn\u2019t one pair of eyes watching her, but several. Even the horses seemed to be studying her. She knew that was nothing more than a fanciful thought, but there was no mistaking the suspicion of the men. She frowned. Maybe they were all vampires like the gate guard. Did vampires ride horses? Wasn\u2019t there some superstition about animals being more sensitive to vampires than humans were? She supposed it was unscientific of her to give any credence to that kind of superstition, not to mention it was probably politically incorrect. Vampires had fought and won several civil rights lawsuits which took into account their unique natures.</p><p>Not wanting to draw any more attention to herself, she sped up once again, following the road as it circled around the barn, slowing as it dipped alongside a small creek bed for what felt like a hundred yards, then circled around a grassy hill to finally reveal . . .</p> <p>Oh. Now that was lovely. And not at all what she\u2019d expected from a vampire\u2019s residence. She hadn\u2019t been foolish enough to imagine he lived in a creaky castle with bats circling around the turrets, but she hadn\u2019t anticipated this, either. This was a beautiful house, built into the hillside and glowing a warm gold in the wash of landscape lights. It was a Craftsman style with a peaked roof and skylights, somewhere around 8000 square feet would be her guess. But there was probably a basement level she couldn\u2019t see, and who knew how big that was? That was one thing the myths got right about vampires. They didn\u2019t like sunlight, which made the skylights an unusual feature, but if the house had windows, why not skylights?</p><p>She drove up the short hill to the foot of the front steps, where a woman appeared to be waiting for her. She wore a severe black pants suit and a blindingly white, tailored blouse, with a short red tie. If not for the spiked heels, Kathryn would have thought she was trying to look like a man. But those heels gave it away. She was either a dominatrix or a lawyer. Kathryn was betting on the latter.</p><p>The woman walked over to the truck as Kathryn was climbing out. She pulled her briefcase off the passenger seat and slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cAgent Hunter,\u201d the woman said, holding out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Magda Turkova, Lord Donlon\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p><p>Bull\u2019s eye! Kathryn thought to herself and shook the other woman\u2019s hand. \u201cSpecial Agent Kathryn Hunter,\u201d she said unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cLord Donlon is expecting you,\u201d Magda said, her attitude all business, but there was a slight edge of hostility beneath it all.</p> <p>Kathryn followed the attorney up the stairs and into a slate-floored foyer that completely lived up to the promise of the golden exterior. The house was single story, but the ceilings were high, the walls raw stucco and painted a blend of warm hues. The d\u00e9cor was decidedly western, but elegant and reeking of wealth. Apparently, it paid to be a vampire, especially one with a title.</p><p>Magda continued through the entry, leading Kathryn around a handsome, double-sided fireplace and into a living room which had clearly been decorated with a male sensibility. Big couches and chairs were gathered around a huge slab of glass that was perched on a piece of rock and served as a coffee table. The room was nicely done, but there were no dainty designer accents, no carefully posed vases or works of art. Instead, there was a pile of magazines comprised of mostly sports and business, with a big screen monitor gracing the main wall. A bookshelf next to the monitor boasted a collection of videos and games and at least four separate gaming consoles. Next to that, a wall of windows looked out on the front of the house and down across the property, with its dark clusters of trees. Kathryn noted the slight distortion that told her the glass in the window was bulletproof. Apparently, all was not happy in the land of vampires.</p><p>The lawyer indicated the seating area. \u201cLord Donlon will be with you in a moment.\u201d She walked over to a wet bar.</p><p>Of course, there was a wet bar. What else would there be in a man cave like this? Kathryn thought cynically.</p><p>\u201cMay I offer you a drink?\u201d Turkova asked. \u201cOr no, you probably can\u2019t drink on duty, can you? We have water, or soft drinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater would be nice. Thank you,\u201d Kathryn said. Normally, she wouldn\u2019t accept anything to eat or drink from a person she was about to question in relation to a crime. But first of all, she wasn\u2019t certain a crime had been committed. Secondly, she had no evidence that Lucas Donlon was directly involved in her brother\u2019s disappearance, and, in fact, doubted that he was. And finally, she was thirsty.</p><p>Magda retrieved a bottle of water from the under the counter refrigerator and grabbed a glass from the overhead rack. \u201cWould you like ice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. And I don\u2019t need a glass. Just the bottle will be fine.\u201d</p> <p>Magda gave a brief smile. \u201cMy own preference, as well. I can rarely drink one of these things\u2014\u201d She held up the bottle. \u201c\u2014in a single sitting. I like to take it with me rather than throw it away.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn took the proffered water. It was icy cold, the bottle slightly wet with condensation. \u201cSo, Ms. Turkova,\u201d she began, but the woman interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cMagda, please. We don\u2019t stand on ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do have guards.\u201d</p><p>Turkova gave a dismissive shrug. \u201cA necessary precaution for my lord\u2019s security.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn tipped her head to one side in curiosity. \u201cYou refer to him as lord. Is that a hereditary title of some sort?\u201d</p><p>Magda laughed lightly, sounding genuinely amused. \u201cNo, not at all. Vampire society has a feudal structure, Agent Hunter. And Lord Donlon rules a substantial territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeudal . . .\u201d Kathryn repeated, thinking that if nothing else, she\u2019d gain substantial knowledge about vampires from this visit. \u201cDo his subjects\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot subjects. His people. We have made some concessions to the modern age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. His people. But if the system is feudal, do they tithe to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. He protects them, defends them from both humans and other vampires. He also runs a considerable corporate empire, which I\u2019m sure you know. Many of his people work for him directly, others he underwrites. Lord Donlon is a businessman, a very successful businessman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Agent Hunter, what brings you to South Dakota? I know for a fact that you are not based out of our jurisdictional field office, which is in Minneapolis.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn chuckled, shivering intentionally. \u201cMinnesota\u2019s a little too cold for my bones. No, I work out of Quantico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And what does Quantico want with Lord Donlon?\u201d Magda\u2019s tone was just as casual as it had been, but her gaze was abruptly intent. The lawyer emerging at last.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made no secret of the reason for my visit, Ms. Turkova. I\u2019m investigating the disappearance of someone. A photographer from California who was here to shoot the Badlands. He\u2019s an artist of some repute and has friends in high places. Hence, the FBI\u2019s interest in what normally would be a matter for state or local authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And what is this photographer\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn smiled, knowing that Turkova almost certainly knew Daniel\u2019s name already. \u201cI\u2019m here to interview your client,\u201d she said mildly, but firmly, \u201cnot you, and not to be interviewed by you, either. Is Lucas Donlon available?\u201d</p><p>Magda bared her teeth in an unfriendly smile. She wasn\u2019t as blatant about it as the sphinx-like guard had been, but Kathryn clearly caught sight of two delicate white fangs. \u201cIt never hurts to try,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Kathryn agreed.</p><p>Magda pulled a cell phone from her pocket and hit a number. \u201cAgent Hunter is here,\u201d she told someone, then disconnected and slipped the phone back into her pocket. \u201cLord Donlon will see you now.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn followed Magda Turkova out of the comfortable living room and down a long, tile-floored hallway. Turkova\u2019s high heels tapped loudly on the hard surface, and all Kathryn could think of was how cold these floors must be in winter. This was South Dakota, after all. She\u2019d never lived in any of the truly cold states, but she saw the weather reports like everyone else, and South Dakota was usually buried in snow for months at a time. The heating bill for this house must be cosmic. But she supposed if you could afford a place like this on a ranch this big, then you didn\u2019t worry much about heating bills. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Turkova\u2019s cell phone rang. She glanced at the ID and scowled, but she answered before it rang a second time.</p><p>\u201cMagda.\u201d She listened, then said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And that was it. Kathryn figured it was Donlon calling, maybe asking if they were on their way or something. Maybe he was anxious to get the interview over with and return to his vampire business, whatever that was. Actually, her data run on Donlon had listed considerable financial holdings, but everything was owned under his corporate identity of Donlon Inc. It was a private corporation, which meant he wasn\u2019t required to make the details of his holdings and/or earnings public unless he wanted to. And he clearly didn\u2019t want to. Usually, even private corporations made some things public\u2014charitable stuff that was good for their public image, or information they intentionally let slip to influence a particular business transaction. And sometimes political donations were revealed, when it served their corporate interests. But Donlon didn\u2019t seem to care about any of that. She hadn\u2019t been able to find a single article on him or his corporation, not in the major journals, not even in the local newspaper.</p> <p>Kathryn and Turkova were met halfway down the corridor by what she took to be another gatekeeper. Male, presumably a vampire, six-foot-three, blond and brown, big shoulders and arms, so probably two twenty-five or more in weight. He was good-looking in an all-American football captain sort of way and gave her an openly friendly smile before stopping them in front of a pair of big wooden doors with iron belting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it from here, Magda,\u201d he said, as if he was the one in charge. \u201cAgent Hunter,\u201d he said, turning his attention Kathryn. \u201cMy name is Nicholas. Lord Donlon is waiting, if you\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn scowled inwardly at the use of the honorific for Donlon, but outwardly she only nodded briskly and said, \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Unfailingly polite and professional, that\u2019s what the FBI expected of their agents.</p><p>Nicholas opened the door. Kathryn started to step forward, but stopped in surprise when he strode in ahead of her. It threw her off enough that she paused on the threshold until Magda made an impatient noise behind her.</p><p>Kathryn continued into the room, her gaze sweeping the space, cataloging everything she saw. It wasn\u2019t quite what she\u2019d expected, but then so far, nothing about this vampire\u2019s lair had been. The room was big and airy, very masculine, but tasteful, with a grouping of dark leather furniture to one side, in front of an even darker row of wooden bookshelves that lined the entire length of one wall. There was a fireplace on the opposite wall, with a carved wooden mantle, and above that a beautiful oil painting depicting moonrise over what she assumed was the nearby Badlands, although it could just as easily have been MonumentValley in Arizona or another similar desert setting. She wasn\u2019t that familiar with any of them. But the artist had caught the surreal look of those landscapes, and the rising moon gave it such an alien cast that if someone had told her it was another planet, she would have believed them.</p> <p>On the side of the fireplace nearest the hallway door, the wall was unadorned except for a series of black and white photographic prints. Kathryn\u2019s eye ranged over the photographs as closely as she could without being obvious about it, and there was no doubt. She had none of Daniel\u2019s talent, but she had a terrific eye for detail, and she knew his work. They were from a series he\u2019d done on Ireland some years ago.</p><p>Her gaze shifted to the vampire she\u2019d come to see, Lucas Donlon, but the broad-shouldered Nicholas was still in the way. Impatient now, she started to walk around him just as he addressed Donlon, saying, \u201cMy lord,\u201d and stepped aside, like a magician revealing his trick.</p><p>Lucas sprawled behind his desk, consciously projecting an image of negligent ease, which was at complete odds with what he was feeling. The timing on this FBI investigation sucked overall, although he was glad to get it over with at last. With his incursion last night into Klemens\u2019s territory, war had been declared. Up until now, the Midwestern vampire lord had limited himself to an occasional, if irritating, foray along the border in an attempt to seize assets he knew belonged to Lucas. His success had been limited, but with the assassination attempt on Raphael, and now Lucas\u2019s response, the gloves would be off. And Klemens was a dirty fighter.</p><p>Vampire wars in general were fought differently than human wars. For one thing, there were no grand battles. There weren\u2019t enough vampires on either side for that, and most of those were civilians, who everyone agreed should be left out of the bloodshed as long as they didn\u2019t insert themselves into the confrontation. Or hang around with traitors like Heintz.</p><p>Instead, the war would consist of a series of skirmishes, short-lived and bloody. Every vampire lord had his warriors, some more than others, but no one had more than a few hundred. Because wars were fought with a limited number of combatants, there were lulls in the fighting. Like now. With Lucas\u2019s successful strike last night, and especially since Klemens had suffered the loss of both property and vampires, it would be at least a few days before Klemens could pick a target and rally his forces for a counterattack. That didn\u2019t mean Lucas could relax. His people were on alert all up and down the eastern border, and his warriors were staged in such a way that at least a few of them could reach any attack point fairly quickly. Their job was to hold the line until backup arrived.</p><p>So, if Lucas had to deal with the FBI, this was as good a time as he would get for the foreseeable future. But this whole thing was a waste of time. He didn\u2019t know anything about a missing person, and neither did any of his vampires. He\u2019d questioned them specifically about this matter so that none of them could weasel out and lie to him. A vampire couldn\u2019t lie to his Sire or his sworn master, and Lucas didn\u2019t permit anyone to reside within his territory unless they were at least sworn to him. Most of the vampires living on the ranch itself were his own children, and that included everyone who worked closely with him in the main house.</p> <p>But then, this was South Dakota. There weren\u2019t that many vampires in the entire state. There weren\u2019t even that many humans. Fewer than a million people lived in South Dakota, which was one of the lowest population densities in the country. The majority of South Dakota\u2019s vampires lived or worked right here on Lucas\u2019s ranch. There was a small cluster in Sioux Falls, but they weren\u2019t suspected in the FBI\u2019s missing person case because this Agent Hunter seemed certain her man had gone missing while hanging around in the Badlands, which, by the way, was a good eighty miles from Lucas\u2019s ranch.</p><p>Lucas had his main headquarters here because he loved the area. When most people thought of South Dakota, they thought of the crags of Mount Rushmore with its famous presidents, and they figured the whole state looked like that. But his ranch was beautiful and green\u2014during most of the year, anyway. His estate was over a hundred and fifty acres of rolling grasslands and mature trees, with two separate creeks running through it. It wasn\u2019t as green as his native Ireland, of course, but in the centuries he\u2019d been alive, he\u2019d never been anyplace that was. He loved his ranch, though. He loved raising horses, loved riding them through his land and knowing it was his land. He had other houses throughout his territory, some in much bigger cities. But he always came back here. This was home.</p><p>And now the FBI was invading his home. He didn\u2019t trust the police; he never had. He\u2019d grown up on the mean streets of Dublin when they were truly mean, and the Garda had never been his friend. That was another thing about South Dakota. They left a man alone. As long as he didn\u2019t do anything to draw their attention his way, the authorities didn\u2019t bother him. He wished he could simply tell this FBI woman to go away, but he couldn\u2019t do that. Regardless of his personal preferences, he was responsible for thousands of vampires throughout his territory, which spanned several states. Anything he did could redound on them in unpleasant ways. So, he would see Agent Hunter, and he\u2019d tell her what he\u2019d already said on the phone. He didn\u2019t know where her brother was. Speaking of which, he found it very suspect that Agent Hunter had never bothered to mention that the man she was looking for was her brother. Did she really think he didn\u2019t have the wherewithal to find out details like that? She had surely done a data search on him. Did she think that he wouldn\u2019t do the same on her?</p><p>Granted, his contacts within the FBI weren\u2019t what they\u2019d once been. For years, the vampire community\u2019s best and most secret asset within the Bureau had been Phoebe Micheletti, a former FBI tech and later forensic consultant. Phoebe\u2019s loyalty had been unquestioned because she was a vampire herself. But recent events in Washington, D.C. had shown that perhaps someone should have questioned her more closely. The situation had ended with Phoebe and her longtime mate both dead and the loss of an inside track at the FBI.</p><p>But there were still some vampires employed by the Bureau, especially in the technical areas where they could work at night. They might not have the contacts that Phoebe had once enjoyed, but they were still good enough to know that Kathryn Hunter wasn\u2019t here under official FBI auspices. As for discovering that the missing man was her brother, that took his computer guy all of seven minutes to find on the Internet. Thirty minutes more, and Lucas knew all sorts of things about Hunter.</p><p>He picked up his cell phone and rang Magda.</p><p>\u201cMagda,\u201d she answered immediately. Normally, she used his title to answer when he called, but since she was currently escorting the FBI agent to his office door, she wisely didn\u2019t want to give away that he was the one calling.</p><p>\u201cReach out again to our people in the FBI,\u201d he told her. \u201cSee if they\u2019ve got anything more on Kathryn Hunter. Personal stuff. But make sure they\u2019re discreet, Maggie. I don\u2019t want to set anything into motion until I know more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, the one word clipped and short.</p><p>Lucas disconnected, smiling. Magda absolutely hated it when he called her Maggie. Which was why he did it, of course. He heard footsteps a few seconds later, Maggie\u2019s heels and a nearly silent tread that he assumed belonged to Agent Hunter. Nick had been waiting in the hallway for them, and he spoke as soon as the two women were close enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAgent Hunter?\u201d Nicholas said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was deeper than expected, sexy. Her voice over the phone had been much more businesslike. It was too much of a difference to be explained away by the idiosyncrasies of phone transmission alone. She probably worked at sounding professional, but as far as he was concerned, she\u2019d only sounded robotic. Maybe he should tell her. Maybe he would.</p><p>Out in the hallway, Nicholas could be heard introducing himself, and then the door opened. His lieutenant entered first, which was probably unusual in a human corporate setting. In his experience, the guest would normally be permitted to enter first, followed by their escort. But in Lucas\u2019s world, especially while they were at war with their neighbor, Nicholas would never permit a stranger to approach Lucas directly. And then there was the fact that Kathryn Hunter was FBI. Nicholas had been infected by Lucas\u2019s distrust of police authorities, and so he entered first, with the FBI agent sandwiched between him and Magda, who stood at the door.</p> <p>Lucas didn\u2019t stand. Why should he? Agent Hunter wasn\u2019t a guest. She was an interloper, an interrogator. And she certainly wasn\u2019t due any respect of position from him. He was far more powerful than she was.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Nicholas said formally, and stepped aside, giving Lucas his first real view of Kathryn Hunter.</p><p>Well, well, he thought to himself. Agent Hunter was definitely not what he\u2019d pictured. He\u2019d expected someone who lived up to that robotic phone voice\u2014some sort of Brunhilde with sturdy hips and shoulders to match. What he got was the sexy-voiced version instead. Kathryn Hunter was quite lovely. Or, she would be if she permitted herself. She was tall, nearly six-foot despite those sensible boots. Put her in a pair of lipstick-red, fuck-me heels and she\u2019d definitely top six-foot. Lucas liked tall women. He liked to fuck tall women. Well, okay, he liked to fuck women of pretty much any height. But his favorite fuckable women were tall because he was well over six-foot himself, and he liked to kiss the women he bedded. He especially liked to kiss them while he was inside them, and that was always easier when the parts matched up so nicely.</p><p>And speaking of kissing, his personal FBI agent had a mouth to match the voice. Soft, puffy lips that were made for wrapping around a man\u2019s cock, and she was wearing just a hint of pink gloss that she probably considered practical. But it gave her mouth a vulnerable, little-girl-lost look. Not that she was a little girl. Oh, no. Miss FBI was very much all grown up. She was, however, very prim and proper, just like Kofi had said, with her long, blond hair pulled into a high and tight pony tail, and every hair in place. Her figure was slender for the most part, although he suspected her breasts were much fuller than they appeared. She probably wore some sort of sports bra to flatten her natural assets. He supposed it made sense, given her profession, but it only made him more curious to see the real things.</p><p>The rest of her body was camouflaged by a boring, dark blue pants suit and a white button-up blouse that was definitely buttoned up . . . all the way to her neck. His fingers itched to twitch open that top button and reveal her delicate neck. Actually, they twitched to do a lot more than that, but he\u2019d settle for that top button. No woman should ever be that buttoned up.</p> <p>Slender hips, long legs . . . his perusal traveled back to her face and a pair of dark blue eyes that were regarding him with something short of a friendly look.</p><p>He grinned unapologetically. \u201cAgent Hunter,\u201d he said, without rising.</p><p>Her jaw tightened, but she stepped forward and reached across his desk to offer her hand. \u201cSpecial Agent Kathryn Hunter,\u201d she said, aiming for crisp, but that bedroom voice of hers wasn\u2019t made for it.</p><p>Lucas stood slowly and took her hand in his. It put her at a disadvantage, because she\u2019d stretched across the desk to reach him. She was now left leaning forward while he stood straight, holding her in place by virtue of their joined hands. Lucas made no attempt to alleviate the uncomfortable position. He kept his gaze steady as he wrapped his fingers around hers, catching the slight flair of concern in her eyes as she quickly rebalanced.</p><p>\u201cLucas Donlon,\u201d he said smoothly, still grasping her hand. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve met my lieutenant, Nicholas. How can I help you, Special Agent?\u201d</p><p>Hunter immediately tried to take her hand back, but Lucas wasn\u2019t ready to let her go, and she clearly wasn\u2019t willing to force the issue by jerking her hand away from him. She was aware of him, though. A slight flush lit her cheeks, and it was more than just embarrassment or even anger. Her pupils were dilated, and her heartbeat had just kicked up a notch.</p> <p>He released her hand with a wink. She took a step back from the desk at once, putting distance between them. She didn\u2019t wipe her hand on her pants leg, but he could tell she wanted to. Kathryn Hunter was clearly used to denying her more feminine urges. She probably had to, working where she did. But Lucas was a vampire lord. When he touched a woman, she knew she\u2019d been touched, and, in this case, desired.</p><p>And Kathryn Hunter didn\u2019t like being reminded of that.</p><p>Kathryn found herself staring. If everything she\u2019d seen so far in the vampire\u2019s headquarters had surprised her, Lucas Donlon himself was the final stunner. And that was the right word, too. Because he was one of the best looking men she\u2019d ever seen. He had straight black hair that wasn\u2019t long so much as it looked in need of a trim. It touched his collar in back and threatened to drop over his forehead in front. He didn\u2019t bother to stand up, the ass, but lounged back in his chair like some sort of bad boy making a point. Still, she could see he\u2019d be tall and well built. Not as thickly muscled as his bodyguard, or whatever Nicholas was, but his shoulders were wide and appeared well-muscled beneath the leather jacket he wore over a black T-shirt. She met his eyes briefly. They were hazel, she supposed, but the brown had so much gold in it, they almost defied classification. And they were scanning her from head to toe, lingering in all the inappropriate places. She waited until his perusal finally made it back to her face, then gave him her most frigid stare.</p><p>He grinned in response, and some deeply buried feminine part of her shivered at the sight. Kathryn steeled herself against it.</p><p>\u201cAgent Hunter,\u201d he said lazily, still not bothering to stand.</p><p>Kathryn suppressed the urge to tighten her jaw in irritation. She leaned across the desk and offered her hand. \u201cSpecial Agent Kathryn Hunter,\u201d she said, meeting his arrogant gaze.</p><p>He remained seated, but his big hand closed over hers, his fingers hard and a little rough, as if he did more than sit behind this desk all night long. He stood then, uncoiling a tall, well-muscled body with a grace that only emphasized his looks and strength. Kathryn almost groaned. The black T-shirt was tucked into a pair of faded denims that showcased his flat belly and clung to his narrow hips like a lover\u2019s caress.</p><p>His standing unbalanced her, and she gripped his hand tightly before looking up and meeting his eyes for an awkward moment. She steadied quickly enough and tried to give his hand only a perfunctory shake, but he didn\u2019t release her. Her heart slammed against her ribs, and she cursed her body\u2019s instinctive reaction to his overwhelming masculinity.</p> <p>This shouldn\u2019t be happening. Kathryn worked in a man\u2019s world where women were still barely tolerated by too many. SAC Fielding was only one example of the misconceptions and resentment she faced all the time. She\u2019d long ago come to grips with the fact that in order to succeed, she\u2019d have to set aside her femininity and be simply one more agent, since she would never be one of the guys. She wore no makeup other than a touch of nearly clear lip gloss to keep her lips from drying out completely, and while she couldn\u2019t bring herself to cut her long hair, she always wore it pulled away from her face, either in a French braid or a ponytail so severe she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever need a facelift.</p><p>But somehow Lucas Donlon had broken through all of those precautions with nothing more than a look and a handshake. He\u2019d managed to awaken feelings and desires buried so deeply that she\u2019d all but forgotten she ever had them. And she wanted them left buried. This was her job, her career. This was what she did with her life, and she wasn\u2019t going to let some handsome vampire or anyone else shatter her carefully won reserve.</p><p>\u201cLucas Donlon,\u201d he was saying, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve met my lieutenant, Nicholas. How can I help you, Special Agent?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn thought of all sorts of things she\u2019d like to say to him, most of which involved sharp, pointed objects drilling into his heart. But she reined in her temper and forced herself to back a couple of steps away from the desk, telling her heart to stop acting like such a fool.</p><p>\u201cAs I explained on the phone, Mister Donlon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d he said easily. \u201cAnd do sit down . . . Kathryn.\u201d He slouched back into his own chair like a big, graceful cat, and regarded her over steepled fingers.</p><p>Kathryn sat, using the motion to conceal her irritation at his familiar use of her first name. She considered correcting him, reminding him of her title and that she represented the FBI. Except she didn\u2019t in this case, not really. That thought shocked her back to the matter at hand. She had ten days to find her brother, ten days before her bosses would expect her back on the job. She didn\u2019t have time to waste bandying words with Lucas Donlon. Besides, she had a feeling it would only encourage him if she insisted on her proper title.</p><p>\u201cAs I explained on the phone, Mister\u2014\u201d Donlon raised one eyebrow, and she switched words mid-syllable. \u201cLucas. I\u2019m looking for a photographer who went missing after completing a shoot in BadlandsNational Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are several towns closer to the park than we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that. But he was staying very near here, and this area is where he was last seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how does this relate to me . . . Kathryn?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn blinked. He was actively flirting with her, although flirting was too tame a word for anything Lucas Donlon did. And damn it, her body wanted to respond to the seduction in that deep voice, to the crooning way he kept repeating her name. Kathryn bit her tongue, letting the sharp pain redirect her senses. She didn\u2019t have time for his games. She needed to find Daniel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDaniel Hunter is the man who\u2019s missing. An eyewitness places him at a local nightclub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve quite a few of those in the surrounding area, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but this particular club, according to my sources, is owned and run by vampires.\u201d</p> <p>Donlon lifted his eyes, looking over her shoulder at his lieutenant, Nicholas. The exchange was silent, but it told her he hadn\u2019t expected that particular piece of evidence.</p><p>\u201cA blood house,\u201d he said, returning his gaze to her.</p><p>Kathryn blinked at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>He smiled briefly and repeated, \u201cA blood house. The club you\u2019re referring to is called a blood house. That\u2019s not its name, but that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s where humans go to . . . mingle with vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMingle,\u201d Kathryn said softly. \u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMany humans are fascinated by the vampire . . . culture, shall we say. They go to blood houses to flirt with what they see as the darker side of humanity. And they give blood, of course.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn frowned. \u201cGive blood. You mean from their own veins?\u201d</p><p>Donlon laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked, Kathryn. It\u2019s a very pleasurable experience for all involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me people go to these places and let vampires bite them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s . . .\u201d She was about to say revolting, but thought better of it given current company.</p> <p>Donlon grinned as if he knew anyway. \u201cDon\u2019t knock it \u2019til you\u2019ve tried it. And you will,\u201d he added with a slow, smoldering look.</p><p>Kathryn felt her lips pinch with irritation and forced her face to resume a bland expression. He had a way of goading her completely out of her comfort zone.</p><p>\u201cIn any event,\u201d she said briskly, \u201cwhile I can\u2019t imagine Daniel enjoying something like that, he always has been an adventurer, so it\u2019s possible he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel?\u201d Donlon said, catching her slip. \u201cSo, the last name isn\u2019t merely a coincidence. A husband? Brother? It\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019s old enough to be your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know how old he is?\u201d she demanded at once.</p><p>Donlon shrugged, unconcerned. \u201cI don\u2019t. But I can certainly guess at how old you are, and extrapolate how old your father would have to be. My manager at that club is very careful about whom he lets in. And a man old enough to be your father would never pass muster. Too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous for whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe older man, love. As I said, having a vampire drink from you is very enjoyable. Not everyone\u2019s heart can handle it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLovely,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he agreed, not at all put off. \u201cBut as to your missing . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother,\u201d she supplied. There was little point in trying to conceal it. Sutcliffe knew, and she suspected Donlon knew, too. Despite his little games, she found it unlikely the efficient Magda would have let her get this far without checking out every aspect of her purpose in being here.</p><p>\u201cYour missing brother, yes. I don\u2019t often visit the blood houses, but the vampires on my staff do frequent that particular one, among others. If you have a photograph of your brother, I\u2019d be happy to show it around and ask if anyone saw anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather check it out myself,\u201d Kathryn countered. \u201cIf I could have your club manager\u2019s name and those of any vampires who visit the club regularly . . .\u201d She took out her notepad and pen, prepared to write names.</p><p>Donlon didn\u2019t move except to give her a lazy blink of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible, Kathryn. My people rely on me to protect them, and I take that responsibility very seriously. It was not so long ago that your people were hunting mine down and slaughtering them for no reason. As I said, I\u2019m more than happy to show your brother\u2019s photograph around, but that\u2019s all you\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ll get,\u201d she said sharply, \u201cis a judge\u2019s order requiring your people to submit to questioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d Lucas came to his feet so fast, she didn\u2019t see him move, and she shot up defensively.</p><p>Donlon\u2019s expression was no longer lazy, his voice no longer teasing. \u201cGo ahead, Special Agent Hunter. Get your warrant. Oh, but wait, you can\u2019t, can you? Because you\u2019re not here in an official capacity. In fact, I suspect your supervisors told you to leave this alone, but here you are anyway.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn gave a mental shrug. So he knew she was off the reservation on this one. Powerful men always had ways of finding out things, and she didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking Donlon was any less powerful just because he was a vampire. If anything, it was likely to make him more powerful. He could bring to bear not just economic and business pressure, but that visceral fear of the unknown as well. She had hoped to milk her FBI connection a bit longer, but . . . she sighed inwardly. It looked as if she\u2019d have to play nice with this incredibly handsome bastard, after all.</p><p>She met Donlon\u2019s cool gaze evenly and gave an easy shrug. \u201cIt was worth a shot,\u201d she said, sitting down again. \u201cYes, I\u2019m on my own for this one, and, yes, my superiors would rather I leave it alone. But I suspect their reluctance stems in large part from a desire not to piss you off. I don\u2019t really care about pissing you off. I just want my brother back, and I think you or your people know something about what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because he went to a vampire bar?\u201d Donlon slouched back comfortably into his big chair. Did the man ever sit up straight? \u201cThere are many bars in South Dakota,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd very few of them are owned by vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I have a witness who saw him leaving your bar with someone they say is a vampire. And that\u2019s the last time anyone saw my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the witness, and what\u2019s the vampire\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Kathryn said instantly. The last thing she wanted was to have Donlon discover that her only witness was in Afghanistan. \u201cBut he\u2019s been to the club before, and he\u2019s certain the man leaving with my brother is a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can he be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d Kathryn looked away from the vampire\u2019s too perceptive gaze, feeling her cheeks heat with embarrassment. \u201c\u2014he claims to have been with the vampire in question. I assumed he meant sex, but now that you\u2019ve explained . . . what you\u2019ve explained . . .\u201d</p><p>She chanced a glance at Donlon and found him watching her with blatant amusement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s usually the same thing, Kathryn,\u201d Donlon said, clearly enjoying the moment. \u201cTaking blood from the vein is a very sensuous experience. Sex usually follows. Or precedes. Or sometimes even both,\u201d he added with a teasing grin.</p><p>Kathryn bit her already sore tongue, using the pain to center herself. She was not here for Lucas Asshole Donlon\u2019s amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, Lord Donlon,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you know the basics, maybe even more than that. But you don\u2019t know me. I love my brother, and I will move heaven and earth to find him. I will be the thorn in your side, the stone under your foot. I will make fucking with your existence my damn mission in life until I find out what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>The air left Kathryn\u2019s lungs. She hadn\u2019t dared to ask herself that question. Hadn\u2019t dared to even consider the possibility. She forced herself to meet Donlon\u2019s curious stare.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s dead,\u201d she said in a thin voice she didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cThen I want to take him home.\u201d</p><p>Donlon\u2019s gaze softened with something close to pity. But she didn\u2019t want his pity. She drew a deep breath and stiffened her spine.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not one of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He leaned forward, golden eyes glittering. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve asked my people,\u201d he said in a hard voice, \u201cand I trust them. What\u2019s the vampire\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn thought about not telling him, but decided he couldn\u2019t help her if he didn\u2019t know whom to look for. And if he wasn\u2019t willing to help her, it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d she said. \u201cThe witness didn\u2019t know a last name.\u201d</p><p>Donlon frowned. \u201cThere is no Alex among my vampires, not locally.\u201d He glanced briefly at Nicholas, and Kathryn would have sworn there was some communication going on there. She also noticed that he\u2019d said not locally. Did that mean there was an Alex somewhere else, and they suspected he\u2019d moved into the area? Or that this Alex visited on occasion? She drew a breath to ask him, but he turned his attention back to her, and she waited to see what his next move would be.</p><p>His scowl was still in place, but then, suddenly, as if a curtain had been drawn, everything about him changed. The sardonic gleam was back in his eyes and his mouth quirked into a cynical half-grin as he winked at her. \u201cTell you what, Kathryn. Come back Friday evening, and we\u2019ll take a tour of the club. You can ask around yourself.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn studied him distrustfully. \u201cBut today\u2019s only Wednesday, Why do we have to wait so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the club isn\u2019t open,\u201d he explained slowly, as if she should have known that. \u201cFriday through Sunday only.\u201d</p><p>Shit! Kathryn thought to herself. Possibly her best lead, and she had to sit on her hands for two more days?</p><p>\u201cWhat if they won\u2019t talk to me? I mean the vampires and whoever else is at the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, they\u2019ll talk to you,\u201d he said silkily. \u201cBut I\u2019ll do even better, since I\u2019m certain you\u2019d rather not postpone your investigation while you wait. I\u2019ll make some inquiries here and elsewhere. Come back tomorrow night, and perhaps I\u2019ll have something for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kathryn wondered about Lucas\u2019s almost Jekyll and Hyde transformation, but even more, about his sudden willingness to cooperate. Did he know more than he was admitting?</p><p>\u201cYou could just call me if you find something,\u201d she said ungraciously.</p><p>He only smiled and murmured, \u201cBut where would be the fun in that?\u201d</p> <p>Kathryn stood. \u201cI\u2019m not really here for fun, Mister Donlon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, and don\u2019t I know it?\u201d he responded, with a very genuine-sounding Irish lilt flavoring his words for the first time. Was he Irish? For that matter, how old was he? Vampires lived a long time, if what she\u2019d heard could be believed. She tended to think at least some of it was vampire disinformation. But if even part of it were true, Donlon could easily have been born in some long ago Ireland. The there-and-gone lilt was just one more piece of the mystery that was Lucas Donlon. And she\u2019d always loved a good mystery.</p><p>She stood, as if to leave, then shifted her gaze deliberately to the photographs on the wall next to the fireplace. The ones she knew for a fact that her brother had taken, although that didn\u2019t necessarily mean anything, since Dan\u2019s work was sold in galleries worldwide.</p><p>\u201cThese are beautiful,\u201d she said, crossing to the wall and moving from one photo to the next. \u201cIreland, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u00c9ire we call her,\u201d Lucas murmured directly into her ear.</p> <p>Kathryn\u2019s heart slammed against her ribs. He\u2019d somehow come out from behind his desk and walked over to stand right behind her without her being aware of it. He stood looking over her shoulder, so close she could smell the spicy scent of his skin, could feel the warmth of his breath on her cheek. She had to fight the urge to reach for her gun as she turned her head and found herself looking directly into his strange golden eyes.</p><p>He smiled, a bare upward tilt of his lips. He knew he\u2019d startled her, and he took pleasure in it. Kathryn wanted to step away, wanted to ball up her fist and slug his beautiful, smug face. But she couldn\u2019t do it. She could only stare and try to breathe.</p><p>\u201cHave you been to my country?\u201d he asked in a voice so soft she wouldn\u2019t have heard him if they hadn\u2019t been standing so close.</p><p>It took her a moment to find the words to answer. \u201cYour country?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cMo \u00c9ireann \u00e1lainn. Mo Chro\u00ed mo go deo.\u201d</p><p>The Irish words flowed like beautiful music. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she whispered, unwilling to dispel the echo of the lovely sounds.</p> <p>He leaned even closer, and for one wild moment, Kathryn thought he meant to kiss her. And the worst part was, she was pretty sure she\u2019d let him. Fortunately, he spared her from making that terrible mistake by saying softly, \u201cSomeday maybe I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>He straightened a little, putting just enough distance between them that she could think rationally again, and indicated the photo nearest to her left. Daniel had caught three horses in full movement, running over a grassy paddock, with trees closing in all around. The youngest was still a foal, his back legs kicked up in play.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Kildare,\u201d Lucas murmured to her. \u201cHeart of the Irish thoroughbred country. My grandfather had a place there. Nothing this grand, of course. Just a patch of dirt and an old plow horse. I only visited there once, but it was a memorable event in my too short childhood.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn was surprised he\u2019d told her that much. She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cMy grandparents had horses, too,\u201d she offered, and was rewarded with the most glorious smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, then . . . it seems we\u2019ve something in common, a cuisle. You\u2019ll have to come riding with me sometime.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s cheeks heated with embarrassment. She didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d just called her, but she knew it crossed that invisible line between agent and witness. What was she doing? She wasn\u2019t here to be romanced by Lucas Donlon, no matter how handsome and charming he was.</p><p>Lucas must have sensed that their moment of connection was over. He gave her an \u201coh well\u201d kind of shrug, then stepped back a pace and studied the entire series of photographs. \u201cI don\u2019t know who took these. Magda found them for me. But the photographer has captured my homeland like no other I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He gestured at the images. \u201cI\u2019ll probably never live there again, so I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn looked from her brother\u2019s photographs to Lucas, trying to decide if he was genuine, or if he was playing her. But there was that comment about his grandfather between them, and his expression held such yearning as his gaze traveled from one photograph to the next, that she believed him.</p> <p>\u201cThen you should probably help me find him,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lucas gave her a puzzled look. \u201cFind whom?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn tilted her head toward the photographs. \u201cThe photographer. Daniel Hunter.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her blankly for a moment, then his eyes widened in surprise. \u201cYour brother took these?\u201d He grabbed one of the framed images from the wall and turned it over. Kathryn knew what he\u2019d find. There was a label on the back with her brother\u2019s name and contact information, as well as a statement of copyright.</p><p>Lucas read the label quickly, then turned the photograph over again and searched for a signature on the image.</p><p>\u201cLower left corner,\u201d Kathryn said. \u201cVery small, but it\u2019s there. Just his initials, D H.\u201d</p><p>She watched his eyes as they traveled over the print and saw the moment he found what he was looking for. \u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he swore softly. \u201cNicholas,\u201d he said without turning. \u201cGet Magda in here now.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn heard Nicholas on the phone, but her attention was all for Lucas, who was staring at the photos with new interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the prints,\u201d he said, shaking his head slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s where she bought them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Daniel\u2019s work is carried in a number of very fine galleries\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what about this gallery?\u201d he asked, rubbing a square tipped finger over the gallery\u2019s name on the back label of the frame he still held.</p><p>\u201cWhich one\u2014\u201d Her question was interrupted by the opening of the door. Lucas held up his hand, asking Kathryn to wait as he turned to address Magda.</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d he began, and she saw the woman\u2019s expression tighten with irritation at the nickname. She would have found that intriguing if she hadn\u2019t been far more interested in Lucas\u2019s reaction to her brother\u2019s photographs. \u201cThese photographs,\u201d he continued, gesturing with one hand. \u201cThe gallery owner is Carmichael, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Magda said, clearly puzzled by the question. \u201cHe has a small gallery in Minneapolis, but I believe he brought these from his main gallery in Chicago, because he thought you\u2019d enjoy them.\u201d</p><p>She saw a knowing look pass between Lucas and Magda and knew there was something they weren\u2019t telling her. Something about Carmichael?</p><p>\u201cWhy is Carmichael important?\u201d Kathryn demanded. \u201cWhat does it matter where you bought them?\u201d</p><p>Donlon shrugged and hung the photograph back on the wall. \u201cIt occurs to me that he might be an admirer of your brother\u2019s work. Admiration can sometimes turn to obsession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Carmichael kidnapped Daniel?\u201d she asked, doubtfully. \u201cMy brother\u2019s a big guy, taller than I am, and very athletic. He wouldn\u2019t be easy to grab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be na\u00efve, Kathryn. Even the strongest man can be taken down by the addition of any number of available drugs to his drink. And your witness did say Daniel left the bar with someone. Perhaps it only had the appearance of willingness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the witness also said the man was a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he was wrong about that, or perhaps your brother didn\u2019t actually leave with the person he saw.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn studied his too handsome face, trying to determine whether he was telling her the whole truth. But she might as well have tried to read a statue. Lucas stared back at her with nothing more than a vaguely puzzled expression, as if he couldn\u2019t figure out what her problem was.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said at last. \u201cWhat time Friday night can we visit this vampire bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to get a feel for the place, it will have to be late. What do you think, Nicholas?\u201d he asked, turning to his lieutenant. \u201cEleven o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded. \u201cOn a Friday, yes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Lucas swung back to her with a pleased grin. \u201cIt\u2019s a date then. Eleven o\u2019clock on Friday. Shall I pick you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said immediately. This was not a date, no matter what he said. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He sighed, as if disappointed. \u201cBut do wear something appropriate.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and glanced down at her white blouse and dark blue pants.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to get information, a cuisle, you can\u2019t walk in there looking like you\u2019re about to raid the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said dismissively, as if she\u2019d already considered that. And she was sure she would have. Eventually. Damn it. Damn him. She\u2019d have to go clothes shopping, because the raciest thing she\u2019d brought with her was a cotton tank top.</p><p>Lucas winked conspiratorially, as if he knew what she was thinking.</p><p>Kathryn scowled. She\u2019d clearly gotten off on the wrong foot with Lucas Donlon. \u201cBut we\u2019re meeting again tomorrow night, right? Same time as tonight? And you\u2019ll speak to your people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall count the hours, Agent Hunter.\u201d</p><p>The urge to punch him was growing stronger. Anything to wipe that satisfied smirk from his face. But she had a feeling he was hoping for just that, so she turned and strode out of the office instead.</p><p>\u201cKathryn,\u201d Donlon called just before she reached the door.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, but managed to turn around and inquire politely, \u201cMister Donlon?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you ride?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn frowned in confusion. \u201cRide? You mean horses?\u201d</p><p>Donlon gave her a knowing wink, but had enough grace to say only, \u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d she said, her face hot with embarrassment as she belatedly realized the obvious innuendo in her words. \u201cThe grandparents I told you about died when I was very young, and their place was sold.\u201d And why the hell was she telling him that?</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Wear some jeans tomorrow night, then. You do own a pair of jeans, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn narrowed her eyes in irritation. \u201cOf course. But why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, tempted to tell him where he could shove his cryptic comments, but then she remembered her brother and swallowed whatever she\u2019d been about to say. She couldn\u2019t come up with anything nice to replace it, however, so she simply turned on her heel and strode out into the hallway where Magda was waiting to escort her.</p> <p>Lucas leaned back in his chair and watched the lovely FBI agent storm gently from his office. She was good at concealing her emotions, good at keeping them from showing on her face, anyway. But he was Vampire. He didn\u2019t need her face to tell him what she was feeling. And she was pissed as hell. Not at having her bluff called about the missing man being her brother. She\u2019d clearly expected that, if perhaps not so soon. Mostly, she was pissed because she couldn\u2019t figure out what to make of Lucas himself. She was attracted to him, though. She didn\u2019t want to be, but she was. No denying that. Her arousal had been subtle, and she\u2019d fought against it, but it was there. Especially to a vampire\u2019s senses. He frowned briefly.</p><p>\u201cYou ever bed a cop, Nick?\u201d he asked idly, listening to Kathryn\u2019s and Magda\u2019s footfalls fade down the tiled hallway.</p><p>With the FBI agent safely away and no longer even a potential threat to his Sire, Nicholas flopped down on the same visitor chair Kathryn had occupied moments before.</p><p>\u201cJust one.\u201d</p><p>Lucas focused on his lieutenant, one eyebrow raised in question.</p><p>\u201cYou remember Sandi Hager, down in Kansas City?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSandi? I thought you were seeing her sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Nick shrugged. \u201cTurns out the ladies didn\u2019t mind sharing, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Lucas laughed. \u201cThose were some big women, Nick. You\u2019re lucky they didn\u2019t drain you dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says they didn\u2019t? Worth every minute of it, though.\u201d He grinned, then asked carefully, \u201cYou thinking about the FBI agent, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Lucas tapped a finger idly on the chair of his arm. \u201cPretty lady. Great legs, world class ass, too. Must be a runner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Nick said thoughtfully, then stiffened when Lucas shot him a hard look. \u201cNot my type, though. Nope.\u201d</p><p>Lucas stared at him a moment longer, then sat up. \u201cIs Judy still working with Nightshade down below?\u201d Judy was his head horse trainer, a human who\u2019d been with him since he\u2019d first bought this ranch more than fifty years ago. Judicious doses of Lucas\u2019s blood kept her from aging, so Lucas didn\u2019t have to look for a new trainer every generation. Most of the people working in Lucas\u2019s stables were vampires, but horses were prey animals, and while there were plenty of prey animals who\u2019d evolved to use the darkness for safety, horses weren\u2019t among them. They needed sunlight, and that meant someone had to be there to supervise and work with them during the day, especially the foals.</p><p>\u201cFar as I know,\u201d Nick said, answering Lucas\u2019s question about the young stallion.</p> <p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s get down there. I need to talk to Kurt about Daniel Hunter and see what he knows.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn followed Magda\u2019s swaying hips down the hallway, wondering how the woman managed to walk on those heels without breaking an ankle. She had nothing against high heels. In fact, she appreciated the way they made her already long legs look even longer. But if she wore stilettos like those, she doubted she could stay upright. Not to mention, she\u2019d tower over most everybody she met. And fuck Lucas Donlon for making her feel like a drab worker drone.</p><p>Jesus! Where the hell had that thought come from? She didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what Donlon thought about anything, much less how she dressed. Granted, he was a sexy guy. Okay, probably the sexiest guy she\u2019d ever met. But he was a vampire! He wasn\u2019t a guy at all. It was just her hormones reacting to his good looks. Maybe if she got out more, she wouldn\u2019t go all vaporous at the sight of a good-looking man, er, vampire. She had to remember that. Vampire.</p><p>Magda led her directly to the front door and opened it. \u201cWas there anything else you needed, Special Agent Hunter?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn studied the female vamp. The question had been polite enough, but the tone had been something else altogether, and the subtext was clear: good-bye, and don\u2019t let the door hit you in the ass on your way out. And wasn\u2019t that interesting? She thought about Lucas and his comment that admiration was only a short step from obsession. Her brother Daniel was very good-looking and charming as hell. Women loved him and, even more, wanted to take care of him. If Magda had been the one who chose the photographs . . . Kathryn knew it was a long shot, but went for it anyway.</p><p>\u201cMister Donlon said you did the decorating in here,\u201d she said, gesturing at the beautiful house around them. \u201cIs this a new residence?\u201d</p><p>Magda tilted her head in a peculiar way, as if trying to decide whether to answer the question or stab her with a knife. Kathryn actually draped her hand casually next to her weapon, just in case, and saw the vampire female\u2019s eyes follow the movement.</p><p>Magda showed her teeth in what Kathryn assumed was supposed to be a smile. \u201cThe original residence is a quarter mile from here. The property is old, but this particular house is fairly new. Lord Donlon oversaw the design part of the process. He had a very clear sense of what he wanted here and in the stables. But after that . . .\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe asked me to handle the interior. I know his taste, so I found a decorator I thought could handle it. She took me to some galleries, private showings, and I made choices. Carmichael was one of those, and when he found out whom the photographs were for, he brought the Ireland series to my attention.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think I had something to do with your brother disappearing?\u201d she abruptly asked, mockingly.</p><p>Kathryn shrugged. \u201cIt was only a question. I\u2019m grasping at straws at this point, but maybe if I keep grabbing, I\u2019ll eventually get the right one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? Do you have any family, Magda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Vampire, Agent Hunter,\u201d she replied coldly. \u201cWhatever family I had, I have no more. My family is here now, with my lord . . . and the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have Daniel, and I won\u2019t stop looking until I find him.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn walked out the front door and down the stairs, beeping the locks on her SUV as she went. The truck was right in front of the house, and she was inside with the key in the ignition before Magda had even closed the house door.</p><p>Kathryn turned the key without thinking, but then sat for a moment, breathing deeply, trying to still her thumping heart. The very fact that it was pounding troubled her. She wasn\u2019t a raw, rookie agent. Granted, at twenty-eight, she wasn\u2019t exactly a grizzled veteran either, but Donlon was far from the first suspect she\u2019d ever questioned. And he wasn\u2019t even a suspect. She hadn\u2019t thought going in that Donlon had a direct role in her brother\u2019s disappearance, and, having met him, she was even more convinced of it. But she did think he could help her find whoever was involved. And given his admittedly protective attitude towards his people, she was worried he\u2019d be more concerned with protecting his vampires than finding her brother.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s hands tightened on the steering wheel. She believed with all her heart that Daniel was alive, and she wanted him back. That was her goal. Her only goal. She closed her eyes, forcing herself to calm. If she wanted Daniel back, she needed to be smart about Donlon. He could help her, and he was attracted to her. He\u2019d made that obvious. She didn\u2019t mistake that attraction for anything other than lust, the desire of a charismatic male to carve another notch on his bedpost. But if that\u2019s what it took to get his help, Kathryn would play along, although she wouldn\u2019t play all the way into his bed. Not that sex with Lucas Donlon would be a chore. The man, or rather the vampire, was gorgeous. Unfortunately, he was also arrogant, snide and probably a killer, to boot.</p><p>The lights from the big front windows, which had been spotlighting her car, were suddenly doused, casting her into darkness. It reminded her that she\u2019d been sitting there too long, and she put the SUV in gear, flipped on her lights and pulled away.</p><p>As she retraced her path down the winding drive, she wondered if sex with a vampire always involved blood. She supposed it did. In his videotaped interview, the now-deployed Marine who\u2019d seen Daniel leave the bar had admitted that the reason he knew Alex was a vampire was because Alex had taken blood from him during sex. He\u2019d offered the information readily and seemed almost proud of the fact, as if he\u2019d scored a coup of some sort. He thankfully hadn\u2019t offered any details, but there\u2019d been a dreamy longing to his words, as if it had been a wonderful experience.</p><p>Kathryn couldn\u2019t imagine it. How could having someone bite your neck hard enough to draw blood be anything but painful?</p><p>She came around the hill, drawing even with the barn and paddocks once again. There were more men out there now. She slowed down to watch and recognized Lucas among them. He\u2019d taken off the leather jacket and wore only his black T-shirt and jeans. The jacket had emphasized the breadth of his shoulders, but without it she could see the definition of his chest and flat belly. No doubt about it, Lucas Donlon was sex in cowboy boots. He pushed a black cowboy hat onto his head, and Kathryn rolled her eyes. A black cowboy hat? And at night? Wasn\u2019t that pushing the stereotype just a little? Lucas strode out into the middle of the ring. A huge, black horse immediately loped across the paddock, stopping right in front of him and butting its head against his chest. A human would have been knocked back a few steps by the force of that greeting, but Lucas didn\u2019t budge. He only laughed and returned the greeting with a nose rub for the horse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kathryn couldn\u2019t help smiling as she watched, but the longer she watched, she noticed something else. There was a pattern to the men surrounding Lucas. They moved and shifted, but he was never isolated, never alone. These weren\u2019t just random cowpokes watching the big man ride himself a horse, these were his bodyguards and, from what she saw, well-trained bodyguards. They were probably all vampires, too.</p><p>She saw Nicholas, the vampire who\u2019d been introduced as Lucas\u2019s lieutenant, lean over and say something to Lucas. The vampire lord looked up then, his gaze crossing the intervening paddock and field to where Kathryn sat in her SUV silently observing. His white teeth flashed in a grin, and he tipped his hat in her direction.</p><p>Kathryn felt foolish at having been caught, especially since she really hadn\u2019t meant to linger so long. She quickly put the SUV in gear and hit the gas, breathing a sigh of relief when the road was quickly swallowed up by the first dense cluster of trees. She\u2019d have to be careful with Donlon. She wasn\u2019t stupid enough to deny her attraction to him, but she was smart enough not to do anything about it. Lucas Donlon was not the kind of person an ambitious FBI agent could afford to get involved with. He was part of a secretive society that ruled itself and ignored U.S. law whenever it suited them. No one had ever been able to pin a crime on any of the vamps, though they\u2019d certainly tried. There\u2019d been a case out in L.A. not too long ago. It had been quickly hushed up, but the word underground was that the LAPD had tried to arrest someone very high up in the vampire hierarchy on suspicion of multiple murders.</p> <p>The operative word there was tried to arrest him, because the warrant had been voided less than forty-eight hours after it was issued. And the big vamp had been released with so many apologies from the higher-ups, it was embarrassing. Adding insult to injury, it had been the vamps who found the real killer, the very human real killer, and turned him over to the authorities.</p><p>But even in cases where a vampire actually had committed a crime, the perpetrator disappeared before human authorities could get to him. No one knew for sure if the vampire offenders were imprisoned or executed, or if they were just moved somewhere else, but they were never heard from again. She supposed that was justice of a sort. Not very satisfying for the human authorities, but it saved the taxpayers the cost of a trial, and the outcome was about the same. Maybe even better.</p><p>Kathryn slowed as she approached the stone arch with its low, decorative wall. The same gun-toting guards were there. One of them waved her on. She nodded her thanks and kept going, until she saw the gleam of the whitewashed picket fence. A left turn took her back onto the paved section of road, and then the rough two-track again, until, finally, she hit the highway. She checked the dash clock. There was plenty of time left tonight. She would go back to the motel and check out the witness statements again, make some notes, then get a good night\u2019s sleep. If she was going to be sparring words with Lucas Donlon again, she\u2019d need all of her brain synapses firing on full. And if only she could stop the rest of her body from firing on full for an entirely different reason, she\u2019d be in great shape.</p><p>Kathryn didn\u2019t know what to expect when she arrived at Donlon\u2019s ranch the next day during daylight hours. She\u2019d considered and rejected the possibility that the gate would be unguarded. Even if the vampires were tucked away safely in their beds somewhere, there was the house and barns to consider. And the animals, which to her untrained eye looked valuable. But more than anything, she just couldn\u2019t see Donlon being that lax about security. He pretended to be an easygoing, ain\u2019t-life-wonderful kind of guy, but there was another side to him that she imagined could be quite deadly when it came to the fore. When she\u2019d insisted on questioning his vampires directly, any sense of the playboy had fled, and, in that moment, he\u2019d been all business. And when he\u2019d ultimately told her that his people would talk to her simply because he ordered them to do so . . . she could tell he believed it absolutely. Hell, maybe it was yet another vampire thing.</p><p>In any event, there were guards in all the same places and then some compared to the previous night, but they were human instead of vampire. Whereas the white wooden arch off the highway had been unguarded last night, today there were two human guards blocking her way. She showed them her credentials, and they checked her name against a list. Since Donlon was expecting her, albeit later this evening, Kathryn wasn\u2019t surprised when they permitted her to proceed past this first checkpoint. The second stop, the one with the stone arch, had four human guards in place of the two vampires from last night, although all four of them looked remarkably like their vampire counterparts. If the sun hadn\u2019t been shining, Kathryn wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell them apart. She gave a mental shrug and turned over her FBI credentials one more time. The list was checked again, and she was permitted to continue with one cautionary piece of advice.</p> <p>\u201cThe main house will be locked, ma\u2019am,\u201d one of the four humans informed her politely. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no one there to answer the door. I suggest you wait down by the barns. The trainer\u2019s there, along with her staff. She\u2019ll be able to give you a cold drink and a place to sit, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Kathryn said. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s why she found herself parking in front of the main house and walking up the flagstone paved driveway until she reached a set of wooden stairs that dropped down the twenty or so feet to where the barn and paddocks were located. It was a beautiful, sunny day, the sky a baby blue with not a cloud in sight, despite the cool temperature. Lucas\u2019s snide remarks about her clothes the previous evening had stung, so she\u2019d dressed casually this afternoon. Her hair was pulled into its usual tight ponytail that hung below her shoulders. Her jeans were soft and comfortable, well-worn in all the right places, and she had a white tank top tucked in at the waist. The air was chilly, despite the sunshine, so she\u2019d pulled on a light blue dress shirt, wearing it open like a jacket. At least her footwear was good. At the last minute back home, she\u2019d shoved her boots into her suitcase, after flashing on a sudden mental picture of herself in her FBI blue suit sticking out like a sore thumb on the streets of a dusty, wild west town, complete with raised wooden walkways and hitching rails. The only thing missing had been the Lonesome Dove soundtrack. She\u2019d felt silly at the time, but now she was glad to have them with her. The town was a bit more modern than her vision, but she\u2019d seen plenty of people wearing boots, so she\u2019d been right to bring them. And it had nothing to do with Lucas Donlon and his snarky comments.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs, she followed a well-worn path through the grass that took her to the main paddocks. There were no horses in the barn paddock this afternoon, but in the fields beyond that, she could see several animals grazing in the sunshine. They appeared well cared for and content, and not at all concerned that their owner was a vampire. Kathryn smiled to herself as she made her way past the paddock and around to an open side door.</p><p>This was a horse barn. Kathryn stopped just inside the door, struck by the unique scent of warm horse, clean hay and packed earth. It brought back memories of her grandparents\u2019 ranch. Their place hadn\u2019t been anywhere near as grand as this one, but horses pretty much smelled the same everywhere. Other animals probably had their scents, too. Cows certainly did, and pigs. But there was something uniquely clean about the scent of a horse barn.</p><p>She looked around and found herself on the main walkway between a double line of box stalls, every one of which appeared to be filled. Several of the horses poked their heads out to check out the new arrival, watching her with big, brown eyes. One or two nickered softly, while a big black\u2014even bigger than the animal she\u2019d seen Donlon with last night\u2014snorted his displeasure, his head bobbing up and down as he kicked the wooden side of his stall.</p> <p>Kathryn gave him a wide berth, heading toward the closed end of the barn where she could see a tack room through an open door. Before she got there, a woman emerged, looking not at all surprised to find a stranger in her barn. She was on the short side, no more than five-foot-two, probably less without her boots on. Kathryn would have pegged her weight at 115 to 120, but well-muscled, no doubt from working with horses. Most people didn\u2019t understand how big horses really were, and how much strength it took to ride one properly so it would do what you wanted it to. The woman wore no makeup or jewelry. She had blue eyes and strawberry blond hair that was even longer than Kathryn\u2019s, her braid hanging all the way down her back to her butt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Judy Peterson,\u201d the woman said with a friendly smile. \u201cAnd you must be Special Agent Hunter. Lord Donlon said you might come by.\u201d She took the leather glove off her right hand and held it out.</p><p>Kathryn took it, feeling the rough skin and callouses of hard work. \u201cKathryn Hunter,\u201d she said. So Lucas had expected her to come early? It wasn\u2019t enough that he was unsettlingly handsome and charming, he had to be a mind reader, too?</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see the place in daylight,\u201d Kathryn admitted.</p><p>\u201cLooks different, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Peterson said agreeably. \u201cEspecially my babies.\u201d She gazed down the long line of box stalls with a proprietary air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the trainer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead trainer. I have a couple of assistants and some grooms. Lord Donlon spares no expense when it comes to his animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe breeds them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome. Mostly he rides for pleasure. But he loves horses, and he\u2019s proud of what we\u2019ve done here, so he doesn\u2019t mind letting one of his stallions cover the occasional mare or two. For a price, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Does he ever go outside his own stock for stud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peterson shook her head. \u201cIf he\u2019s interested in a particular line, he\u2019ll buy the stallion outright. It\u2019s a thing with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen and their dicks, I suppose,\u201d Kathryn muttered.</p><p>Peterson laughed. \u201cYou\u2019d be right about that.\u201d</p><p>The big black suddenly kicked the side of his box stall hard enough that it rattled the whole structure, causing several other horses to protest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTromlu\u00ed doesn\u2019t like being ignored.

The horse immediately stuck his nose into her fingers and tongued up whatever had been there. \u201cCarrot,\u201d Peterson said, rubbing the animal\u2019s nose with a fond smile. \u201cHe\u2019s got a sweet tooth, this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTromlu\u00ed,\u201d Kathryn repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Irish,\u201d Peterson told her, without looking away from the big horse. \u201cMeans Nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it? Yeah, this one\u2019s Lord Donlon\u2019s special sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Donlon do any of his own training?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a bit, though he leaves some of it to me, too. He\u2019s mostly interested in the stallions, but he takes on the occasional mare. Likes to sweet talk \u2019em first, \u2019til they don\u2019t even notice he\u2019s climbing into the saddle.\u201d</p><p>Peterson gave such a lusty chuckle that Kathryn knew she\u2019d intended the double entendre.</p> <p>\u201cHe breaks them himself?\u201d</p><p>Peterson smiled, as if remembering something pleasant. \u201cBreaks isn\u2019t the right word for what he does. I swear these animals understand every word he says. He can take a horse like Tromlu\u00ed here and have him literally following him around like a baby goat. It\u2019s a sight to see. Not to mention the pretty picture the two of them make together. Two beautiful beasts moving as one. And that man does know how to sit a horse, let me tell you. MmmMmm.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn grinned, then hid it quickly. She might agree that Lucas was yum-worthy, but it wouldn\u2019t do to let him or anyone else know it.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you,\u201d she asked Peterson curiously, \u201cto call him Lord? I mean this is America, after all.\u201d</p><p>Peterson shrugged. \u201cThe Queen of England comes over to visit, and everyone has to learn how to curtsey, right? They don\u2019t call her Liz, or even Missus Whatever-the-fuck-her-last-name-is. It\u2019s kind of like that for Lucas. He\u2019s a ruler, I guess you\u2019d say, in his own society. It\u2019s only polite to grant him his title. Besides, he\u2019s a good employer. He respects my opinion and lets me do what I love for a living. I don\u2019t mind granting him a little respect in return.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded. Put that way, it made sense to her, too. Besides, deep down she knew she was only trying to poke holes in Lucas Donlon to avoid dealing with her attraction to him. She couldn\u2019t afford to be attracted to anyone right now. She needed to be focused on one thing, and that was finding her brother Daniel.</p> <p>\u201cYou ever notice any strangers around here, Judy? Maybe vampires you don\u2019t see regularly?\u201d</p><p>Peterson didn\u2019t answer right away, but seemed to be giving it some thought. \u201cLord Donlon doesn\u2019t get too many visitors out here. This is his escape. You know, from all the decisions he has to make everywhere else, all the people coming to him for favors and stuff. He goes away for a few weeks every now and then, and when he comes back, I can see how stressed he is. Then he comes out to play with my babies, and he gets happy and becomes himself again.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn eyed the trainer in some surprise. That was a very thoughtful assessment of Donlon. Apparently, Peterson\u2019s talents for understanding animals extended to vampires, as well. Or maybe it was just to stallions, no matter the species.</p><p>\u201cLord Donlon said you\u2019d be riding later?\u201d Peterson said, with a sideways glance. \u201cYou ever ride before, Agent Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Kathryn,\u201d she said, \u201cand, yes, I\u2019ve ridden, though lately not as much as I\u2019d like to. I learned as a child and picked it up again in college. I had a friend whose parents owned a small farm not far from Charlottesville, where the UVA campus is. I used to go there sometimes, especially later when\u2014\u201d Kathryn stopped herself from running off at the mouth. She hadn\u2019t talked about that part of her life for such a long time, it felt odd to do so now. And with a perfect stranger, too.</p><p>The truth she\u2019d almost blurted out was that until her brother started college on his own, she\u2019d spent every weekend home with him, and almost every weeknight, too, making certain he stayed on the straight and narrow path to college himself. Even back then, he\u2019d had a rare talent for photography, and they\u2019d both known it would be his career. But he\u2019d also been a daredevil, challenging the world at every opportunity. He still was, which was why he\u2019d walked off into the backcountry of the Badlands by himself for two weeks. It was rather ironic that when trouble finally caught up with him, it had been at something as ordinary as a private club. Of course, there was the vampire angle to give it a little edge. From their conversations, she knew that touch of danger had appealed to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was rambling,\u201d she dissembled, cutting herself off. \u201cThe short answer is, yes, I ride. Not well enough for that monster,\u201d she gestured at Tromlu\u00ed. \u201cBut well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one rides Tromlu\u00ed but Lord Donlon, anyway,\u201d Peterson told her. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, my beauty?\u201d she added, scratching the big horse\u2019s cheeks as if he were a fluffy kitten instead of nearly a ton of muscle and attitude.</p> <p>Kathryn glanced at the digital readout on her watch. 5:47. \u201cWhat time\u2019s sunset around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time of year, six or thereabouts. It\u2019s getting later every day with spring coming on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should probably get up to the main house, then, huh?\u201d</p><p>Peterson shrugged. \u201cLord Donlon said to expect you, so he\u2019s likely to come looking down here. Takes \u2019em a while to wake up and get going anyway, just like you or me in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Is there something I can do in the meantime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got some stalls need cleaning out,\u201d Peterson said. She laughed at Kathryn\u2019s grimace of reaction. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll start you out easy. You know how to work a curry comb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ve got just the horse for you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas opened his eyes seconds after the sun dropped below the horizon. His daytime sleep had been anything but restful. He\u2019d lain there through the hours of sunlight, plotting strategies for dealing with Klemens, identifying places where the vampire lord\u2019s hold was weak, his people dissatisfied. The latter wasn\u2019t hard to find. Klemens was a benevolent despot at best, and a heartless bastard at worst. He\u2019d toppled the previous ruler of the Midwest through the time-honored tradition of challenge and a fight to the death. It was the way things were done in the world of Vampire, but it didn\u2019t always make for a favorable outcome.</p><p>In Klemens\u2019s case, the Midwestern territory had gone from a lord who held his power gently to Klemens, who ruled with an iron fist. Every vampire lord, Lucas included, had the right to tithe the vampires they ruled and protected. But, like Lucas, most exercised that right sparingly. Klemens, on the other hand, tithed every single vampire in his territory, regardless of their individual situation, and enforced it like some sort of medieval king. Lucas had taken in more than one vampire who had crossed the border just to get away from Klemens and his thuggish collection agents.</p><p>For decades now, Lucas had lived side by side with Klemens in a state of mutual distrust but no outright hostility. It was kind of like North and South Korea. There was the border, and they had both watched it closely, but until now neither had wanted to pay the price of outright war.</p><p>Something had changed with Klemens in the last year. Lucas wasn\u2019t certain what precipitated that change, although he suspected it had something to do with Raphael and the way he was gathering the other vampire lords to his side. He\u2019d already allied with Rajmund in the Northeast and even Sophia up in Canada. In the South, Jabril had died unexpectedly, and Raphael had stepped up to support the new lord, who was too weak to hold the territory on his own. Raphael claimed it was only for the sake of stability. Lucas doubted that, but didn\u2019t care either way. He had no problem with Raphael\u2019s long term goals. He was, in fact, a party to them. But even he didn\u2019t know what had really happened with Jabril. There were rumors that Raphael\u2019s mate Cynthia had been involved somehow, but he\u2019d never managed to get beyond the rumors. Not even Raphael would discuss it with him. Since Lucas and Raphael were far closer than was usual among vampire lords, his Sire\u2019s reluctance to even broach the subject gave credibility to the rumors of Cynthia\u2019s involvement. Raphael had always been very protective of those he loved, especially the women.</p><p>So, it was possible that Klemens had seen Raphael gathering the reins of power into his own hands and decided to make a move before it was too late. And since he\u2019d always coveted Lucas\u2019s territory, it was the most natural target of his new expansionistic impulse.</p><p>Lucas leapt out of bed and went directly to the shower, thanking the gods of invention for modern plumbing as he did every evening. With the hot water pounding him into submission, he considered Kathryn Hunter. She was like a dog with a bone when it came to the search for her brother. And he supposed he couldn\u2019t blame her. If he\u2019d had a brother, he might have done the same. Hell, for all he knew, he had a whole tribe of brothers that he wasn\u2019t aware of since his father had split when Lucas was still a baby. His parents had never married, and his mother had always refused to talk about it. Lucas suspected his father had been married to someone else, his mother no more than a summer night\u2019s fling. When she\u2019d ended up pregnant, the fling had become a burden, and his father had fled back to the safety of his wife and family. Lucas didn\u2019t have any proof of his theory, though by now he had the resources to pay someone to dig it up if he\u2019d wanted. For that matter, he could have hired Raphael\u2019s mate Cynthia to track his ancestry as so many of the others were doing.</p><p>But the truth was he didn\u2019t care all that much. That life, his human life, was long behind him and didn\u2019t have a place in what he was now.</p><p>His phone rang as he was climbing from the shower. Drying his hair with one of the fluffy towels, he walked into the living area of his underground vault and snatched up his cell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, I wanted you to know that Agent Hunter is on the premises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she, now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my lord. She\u2019s down in the barn . . . currying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurrying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. It appears Judy has put her to work.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed. \u201cShe has a habit of doing that with people. Okay, Nick. I\u2019m going to finish up here and go down to the barns myself. I\u2019m fancying a ride in the moonlight with my personal FBI agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead, Nick,\u201d Lucas sighed. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not just a cop, Lucas. She\u2019s a fed. The forbidden fruit of cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she is. Which will just make it sweeter when she drops into my hand.\u201d</p><p>He found Kathryn exactly where Nicholas said she\u2019d be, with the sweet smell of fresh hay and horses all around her, using a curry comb on Sassy, who despite her name, was one of his more mild-tempered mares. Kathryn had donned a pair of faded denims, and they showed her ass to perfection, just as he\u2019d known they would. Much better than the boxy slacks she\u2019d worn the previous night. The barn was warm, despite the cool night air, and she was working hard. A tailored blouse hung outside the box stall, leaving Kathryn in a stretchy white tank top that accented her smoothly muscled arms with every stroke of the comb.</p><p>Lucas tilted his head and listened. Kathryn was talking to the horse as she worked, speaking so softly that even his vampire hearing couldn\u2019t pick up the words.</p><p>He started to say her name, then changed his mind. She was so entranced with the animal and the repetitive motion of the curry comb that she hadn\u2019t even noticed he was there. The mare noticed him, of course. But after a soft whicker of greeting, she ignored him. Which left only Kathryn. Walking as quietly as only a vampire can, he stepped up right behind her and dipped his face into the crook of her neck, inhaling deeply as he deposited a soft kiss just below her right ear.</p> <p>Kathryn gasped and spun around, her hand going to her hip for the weapon she\u2019d left sitting on the tack box beneath her shirt. That didn\u2019t hamper her any, however. She swung the damn curry comb instead, and if he hadn\u2019t been a vampire, he\u2019d have been wearing more than a few stripes on his face.</p><p>Lucas caught her wrist gently, laughing in both surprise and appreciation. He did love a woman with spirit. And he should have expected it from Kathryn Hunter, he thought ruefully. After all, a woman didn\u2019t make it in the man\u2019s world of the FBI without being able to take care of herself. Nor did such a woman traipse halfway across the country looking for her missing brother. He was lucky he wasn\u2019t sporting a bloody face about now.</p><p>Kathryn wrenched her arm away from him and shoved him back a step. Neither of which she could have done if he hadn\u2019t let her, but she didn\u2019t know that yet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky that pretty face of yours is still intact,\u201d she snarled angrily.</p><p>Lucas widened his eyes. \u201cWas that a compliment, Agent Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you ass, that was a warning. Don\u2019t ever sneak up on me again. What if I\u2019d been armed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I trust you\u2019d have held me gently as I bled onto all this nice, clean straw.\u201d</p><p>She bit her cheek, trying not to smile, but it was a lost battle. \u201cAre you ever serious?\u201d she asked, trying to recover lost ground.</p> <p>\u201cOnly when I have to be.\u201d</p><p>Tromlu\u00ed bellowed angrily from his box stall at the other end of the barn, demanding Lucas\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me a moment. Tromlu\u00ed is very possessive. You and he will have to work something out if we\u2019re going to continue this relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat relationship?\u201d she muttered behind him. He smiled as he made his way down the uncluttered aisle to his beautiful black. The stallion poked his head out before he got there, blowing and snorting as if to say, \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, boyo, I missed you, too,\u201d he murmured, rubbing the big horse\u2019s broad nose.</p><p>\u201cIs this the horse I saw you working with last night?\u201d Kathryn asked from several steps away.</p><p>Lucas glanced over his shoulder and received a solid head bump from Tromlu\u00ed for his trouble. The stallion rolled his eyes in Kathryn\u2019s direction and shifted behind the gate of his box stall, as if trying to interpose his considerable bulk between his beloved master and the interloper.</p><p>Lucas laughed at the horse\u2019s antics. \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to worry about, mo Tromlu\u00ed,\u201d he crooned, then spoke to Kathryn in the same smooth tone, without looking back at her. \u201cThe horse last night was Nightshade, Tromlu\u00ed\u2019s oldest son. He\u2019s barely a yearling, while Tromlu\u00ed is a strapping man of four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous. I mean, they both are, but Tromlu\u00ed is larger than life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that, boyo? The lady thinks you\u2019re handsome.\u201d He glanced at Kathryn.</p><p>\u201cJudy thinks the two of you make a pretty picture.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed easily. \u201cThe truth is he\u2019ll take no other rider. It\u2019s a bad habit, but one I indulge since we both enjoy the relationship. Speaking of which, it\u2019s a beautiful night, would you like to ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow? I mean, in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dark. The moon is only a day past full. Besides, the horses know the trails, and we\u2019ll stick to the easy ones for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not dressed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dressed just fine, Kathryn. Even wore your boots. Are you looking for an excuse? Afraid to be alone with me?\u201d He glanced at her again, long enough to wag his eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>\u201cOf course, not. But I left my jacket in the car, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackets, we have.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been having most of this conversation with Lucas directing his words at the jealous Tromlu\u00ed, but now he turned and called down the aisle, \u201cJudy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, boss?\u201d Judy Peterson\u2019s head popped out from the tack room. He\u2019d known she was back there, because he\u2019d heard the television. She liked to hang around in the evening just in case he managed to get down to the stables. Usually, if he didn\u2019t make it in the first couple of hours, he wouldn\u2019t be coming at all, or if he did it would only be to visit Tromlu\u00ed, not to ride.</p><p>\u201cSaddle Sassy for Kathryn, would you?\u201d He turned to Kathryn. \u201cYou do ride western, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re not one of those horse snobs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly snobbery, Lucas, but, yes, I ride Western, as well as English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s English, a cuisle, it\u2019s not worth doing.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn rolled her eyes at him, but he only grinned and turned his attention back to the stallion. \u201cWhat do you say, Tromlu\u00ed? Nothing like a fine moonlight ride with a beautiful woman, is there?\u201d He stepped back enough to open the stall. The stud surged out as soon as the gate was wide enough, but Lucas was ready for him. It was a little trick his horse liked to play. The animal had a bit of the devil in him\u2014more than a bit to be truthful\u2014and he did love to see the silly humans run.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t run from anyone. He grabbed the stallion\u2019s head and brought their faces together. \u201cYou be good now. You\u2019re embarrassing me in front of the lady.\u201d</p><p>He knew the horse didn\u2019t actually understand what he said, but his tone got through well enough. Tromlu\u00ed rubbed his big head against Lucas\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cAye, I love you, too, boyo.\u201d He grabbed the stallion\u2019s bridle from the hook next to the gate and was about to slip it on when his cell phone rang. He frowned. Most of his calls were routed through the main number at the house, so this could only be Magda or Nicholas, both of whom rarely disturbed him when he went riding. Lucas pulled the phone from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cNicholas?\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scrambling the troops, my lord,\u201d Nicholas said urgently. His voice was jumping, as if he were running as he spoke. \u201cWe just got a call\u2014\u201d</p><p>And that quickly every plan Lucas had made for the evening was changed. He stopped listening to his lieutenant, his mind already searching the thousands of vampires in his territory for whatever it was that had Nicholas gearing up for battle.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he swore softly. The compound in Minnetonka, Minnesota was under attack. It was filled with civilians, which should have put it off limits, but Klemens was breaking all the rules in his hunger for power. Civilians wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against Klemens\u2019s fighters, but at least the compound\u2019s leader, Thad, had some combat experience. And the compound itself should have had security in place. \u201cWho called us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome kid, my lord. Says his mom\u2019s mated to one of ours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDex. His mom\u2019s been with Thad since the kid was a baby. Not mated, though. What\u2019d he say?\u201d Lucas began walking Tromlu\u00ed toward the open barn doors at the other end. He walked the stallion out and released him into the big paddock which was always empty and reserved for him. The horse would throw a major tantrum if Lucas tried to put him back into his box stall now, and Lucas didn\u2019t have time for it.</p><p>\u201cThey hit a half hour ago. Thad rallied a defense, but the kid doesn\u2019t know how long they can hold it. He was pretty upset. A lot of screaming in the background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was on his way home from a friend\u2019s. Saw Klemens\u2019s troops arrive and was smart enough not to go running into a situation he couldn\u2019t change.\u201d</p><p>Lucas walked back into the barn and caught Judy\u2019s attention. \u201cJudy,\u201d he said in an aside as he listened to Nicholas. \u201cI have to leave. Let him run awhile, then bring him inside. I won\u2019t be back until late, if at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d she said briskly and immediately began putting away the saddle she\u2019d just gotten out for Kathryn.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s our ETA?\u201d Lucas asked, going back to Nicholas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSikorsky\u2019s on its way\u2014\u201d The big helicopter rumbled by overhead, preparatory to swinging around for a landing in the flat field behind the main house.</p><p>\u201cJust landed,\u201d Lucas said unnecessarily. \u201cFlight time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo, two and half hours. Good news is we can land directly on-site. Thad\u2019s got that field he uses for baseball in the summer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaseball,\u201d Lucas muttered. \u201cMight just save his life tonight. All right. Give me five, and once we\u2019re in the air, I\u2019ll do what I can from there.\u201d</p><p>Lucas hung up and caught sight of Kathryn eyeing him like a woman ready to go into battle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, matching his running pace out of the barn.</p><p>\u201cNothing you can help with,\u201d Lucas said, forcing himself to maintain a human\u2019s slow speed.</p><p>\u201cA transport helo just came in,\u201d she pointed out, \u201cand I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t a search and rescue. I\u2019m trained law enforcement, Lucas. Let me help.\u201d</p> <p>He stopped and turned to face her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kathryn, but this is vampire business. I\u2019ll call when I can. And now I have to run.\u201d Before she could stop him, he fisted his hand in her long ponytail and pulled her in for a hard, fast kiss, and then he was gone, no longer pretending that he was anything but Vampire. His people were dying. He had no time left for pretense.</p><p>Nicholas was waiting for him at the helicopter. The last of his fighters jumped aboard as Lucas raced onto the field. The big helicopter was designed for sound reduction, but the noise of the main rotor was still considerable. Nicholas handed him a pair of headphones as soon as he got close enough, and as Lucas climbed on board he saw that each of his vampires wore the same.</p><p>The pilots, both vampires, took off almost as soon as Lucas was aboard. Nicholas pulled a duffle bag from underneath the seat and kicked it over to Lucas, who nodded his thanks. He immediately went to work, changing the clothes he was wearing. What was suitable for a pleasant evening\u2019s ride was not at all what he needed to go into battle against his own kind.</p><p>Black leather pants replaced his worn denims, the white T-shirt he\u2019d put on so that Kathryn could see him more easily in the dark was stripped off in favor of solid black, and laced-up combat boots finished the look. A black leather jacket was pulled on over it all, making it easier for him to maneuver in the shadows against his enemies. Because one thing was certain. The vampires Klemens had sent to attack the civilians at the Minnetonka compound were clearly vicious and out for blood. They\u2019d demonstrated that by attacking a peaceful enclave against all the precedents of war. But as cruel as they might be, none of them was a vampire lord, and none of them would be able to stand against Lucas himself.</p><p>Kathryn watched, frustrated, as the helicopter took off into the night sky. Within minutes, it was airborne and gone, even the sound of its departure no more than a memory. She squinted into the distance, but the helo had been painted a dull black so that it disappeared despite the full moon.</p><p>She sighed. A few moments ago, she\u2019d been looking forward to a moonlight ride with a handsome man\u2014okay, not a man, a vampire. But vampire or not, it was the most pleasure she\u2019d gotten from a man\u2019s company in a long time. Lucas was charming and clever. And he loved his horses. Who would have thought? When she\u2019d first heard he lived in South Dakota, she\u2019d imagined some sort of cowboy wannabe, sitting up in his big house with cowhide everywhere, and never stepping foot into a barn, much less riding a horse.</p> <p>But she\u2019d been wrong. She also would never have believed she could be attracted to a creature who sucked blood to stay alive. But she\u2019d been wrong about that, too. More\u2019s the pity.</p><p>And now, she was standing in an empty field, having lost both her vampire expert and her riding date all in the space of a few minutes.</p><p>She stared moodily in the direction the helicopter had taken. She\u2019d only been able to hear Lucas\u2019s side of the conversation, but she\u2019d gotten a glimpse into the helicopter just before it took off, and judging by the very speed with which this whole thing had been put together . . . well, if they\u2019d been in a war zone, she\u2019d have guessed the enemy had just attacked. That helicopter had all the marks of a rapid response team. But what were they responding to?</p><p>Whatever it was, she doubted it would be in the morning papers.</p><p>She started back toward the house where her SUV was parked, frustration and worry gnawing dual holes in her gut. She wasn\u2019t a single step closer to finding Daniel, and so far her investigation had turned up a whole lot of nothing. Lucas supposedly had people looking into it, but now he\u2019d rushed off before telling her if they\u2019d found anything. She couldn\u2019t even check out the club herself, because the damn thing wasn\u2019t open until tomorrow night. She frowned, wondering if Lucas would be back in time to make their club appointment tomorrow, and decided it didn\u2019t matter. If he showed, great. If not, she\u2019d go by herself. Too much time had already been wasted while the local authorities had ignored her insistence that something was wrong, and while she\u2019d waited for her bosses in Virginia to give her a few lousy days off. Kathryn knew too much about this sort of crime to think it didn\u2019t matter. With every day that passed, the trail grew colder, and it became less likely she\u2019d locate Daniel before it was too late.</p><p>Too late for what, she couldn\u2019t say, or maybe wasn\u2019t prepared to admit.</p><p>She reached the parking area in front of the big house and beeped the SUV\u2019s locks open. A light came on somewhere deep in the house, visible through the dark windows of the man-cave front room. Magda was probably in there somewhere, probably hadn\u2019t gone off to whatever battlefield had pulled Lucas away. The female vamp didn\u2019t strike Kathryn as the fighter type, except maybe in the courtroom. She was probably a real killer in that setting.</p><p>Kathryn briefly considered knocking on the door and asking Magda if Lucas\u2019s inquiries had turned up anything, but discarded the idea right away. She wasn\u2019t really up to dealing with the prickly lawyer, and besides, even if Magda knew anything, she\u2019d withhold it just to prove she could. Kathryn knew the type, women who disliked other women as a matter of principle. Magda functioned best in an environment where she was the only female, and as far as Kathryn had seen, that made Lucas\u2019s ranch pretty much ideal. Other than Judy Peterson, she hadn\u2019t seen any other women around the place.</p> <p>Kathryn reached for the truck door, then paused, wondering if Lucas and Magda ever . . . The stab of jealousy she felt at the idea of the two of them together surprised her with its intensity. All right, so she found Lucas Donlon attractive, sexually attractive. But who wouldn\u2019t? She\u2019d have to be dead not to. The vamp oozed sexuality, and he knew it, too. He used it ruthlessly to get what he wanted.</p><p>She opened the door and reached across the seat for the light jacket she\u2019d left there earlier. Pulling it on, she slid behind the wheel and closed the door, then spun the temperature control knob to its highest setting in hopes of getting the heat to work faster, even though she knew it didn\u2019t work that way.</p><p>While she waited for the SUV to warm up, she tried to decide what to do next. She\u2019d pretty much tapped out the local witnesses, with the exception of the club, which was out. So who else was there? Her gaze rested on the house in front of her, with the golden glow of its interior gleaming through windows and skylights. Magda might be a shrew, but she\u2019d done an excellent job of decorating.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s thoughts skidded to a halt. The photographs. Magda had said that Daniel\u2019s photographs on Lucas\u2019s study wall were from a gallery with branches in Minneapolis and Chicago. She glanced at her watch, gauging time zones and distance. Chicago was unrealistic, but she could probably still catch a flight to Minneapolis tonight. She could have all day there tomorrow and be back in time to meet Lucas for their club date. Not that it was a date date or anything.</p><p>She cursed silently, remembering Lucas saying that the owner of the galleries, Carmichael, was a vampire. So, maybe she wouldn\u2019t be able to catch him personally, but his gallery was sure to be open at least partly during the day. Most of them were, and he\u2019d have to compete, after all. Which meant someone would be working. Someone with access to sales records, specifically records of who else had bought Daniel\u2019s work, and who might have seemed a little too interested in the photographer himself. And if they were reluctant to talk, Kathryn wasn\u2019t above flashing her badge to persuade them. She waited for the inevitable twinge of guilt at the thought of using her position that way, but it never came.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Lucas sat with his eyes closed, head leaning against the hard back of his seat. The helicopter was configured for maximum troop transport, not comfort, which meant the seats were sturdy and utilitarian. Nicholas was on the phone next to him, but Lucas tuned him out. He trusted his lieutenant to make the right decisions when it came to deployments of this kind. Lucas had more important things to do. His mind was with his vampires in Minnetonka, seeing the battle through their eyes, feeling their fear and pain.</p><p>Every vampire lord had talents that were unique to him alone. Raphael was powerful beyond measure. Duncan was the strongest empath Lucas had ever met, and possibly the strongest vampire empath ever. Lucas\u2019s talent was different than even Raphael\u2019s. He had a unique connection to his vampires, especially those who were his own children. He could see through their eyes, which wasn\u2019t unusual for a vampire lord, but more importantly, he could lend them his strength\u2014both physical and psychological\u2014giving them the ability and confidence to fight against seemingly overwhelming odds. If the vampire wasn\u2019t too critically injured, he could also channel enough energy to keep him alive until help arrived. But with the battle now raging, even Lucas\u2019s considerable power was being taxed. There were too many of the enemy, and too few of his own on the scene.</p><p>Of the Minnetonka vampires, only Thad had any battle experience. They were civilians\u2014merchants and skilled laborers. That Klemens had attacked them was so far beyond the pale that Lucas didn\u2019t think any of the other vampire lords would find it acceptable. There were good reasons for vampire rules of combat. Their people were not numerous, but their vampire natures had them fighting with each other all the time. If they started wiping out entire civilian enclaves, their numbers would dwindle even further. Not to mention that bloody battles of that sort would draw the unwanted attention of human authorities. It was one thing to lose even a houseful of warriors at a remote outpost like the one Alfonso Heintz had set up. It was another to wipe out a compound like the one in Minnetonka with human women and children inside. There were at least four human females living in the Minnetonka house, and Dex was only one of several children. Lucas knew Dex was safe, but he was too caught up in the battle itself to know about the others. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He became aware that Nicholas had grown quiet. Lucas opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Nicholas began. \u201cFour warriors are on their way out of Minneapolis. I couldn\u2019t risk more for fear that this was a feint by Klemens, and the real target was the HQ in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long before they arrive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMinutes. It\u2019s only twenty miles or so. It probably took them as long to get geared up and into the truck as it will to drive there. They\u2019ll ping me when they arrive.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded silently, no longer seeing his surroundings, though his eyes remained open. He was already back in Minnetonka with his vampires. \u201cTell them to hurry, Nick. Klemens\u2019s troops have broken the first perimeter.\u201d His eyes closed as pain knifed his heart. \u201cThey\u2019re sparing no one,\u201d he added in a whisper. Lucas wept bloody tears as he witnessed the carnage, as he felt the agony of his vampires. Klemens would pay for this. If it was the last thing Lucas did on this earth, he would make that bastard pay with his life for this and for Raphael.</p><p>The journey became an endless blur of rage and agony. Some part of him heard Nicholas tell him the four Minneapolis vamps had arrived and were engaging. He heard murmured casualty reports, but he didn\u2019t need those. He knew what the situation was on the ground, knew just how desperate it had become. The four helped, but they weren\u2019t enough.</p><p>Finally, he felt the helicopter tilt as it began its descent. At the same moment, he heard Nick tell someone they were minutes out. Lucas opened his eyes and scanned the vampires he\u2019d brought with him, wanting to be certain they were ready. He\u2019d lost enough tonight. He didn\u2019t want to lose anyone else.</p><p>Clicking the appropriate switch on his headgear, he said, \u201cGentlemen.\u201d Every head turned his way. \u201cScorched earth. None of theirs walks away from this.\u201d</p> <p>His warriors nodded grimly. They hadn\u2019t been privy to his firsthand observations, but every one of them would have heard Nick\u2019s conversations. First with the vampires in Minnetonka, and then with the Minneapolis contingent once the four arrived at the enclave. They knew how brutal Klemens\u2019s attack had been, not only to the Minnetonka vampires, but to the humans, as well.</p><p>They were still a hundred yards off the ground when Lucas stood and yanked off his headset. He barely registered the deafening noise as he stood in the helicopter\u2019s open doorway and took in the scene on the ground. The stench of the battle hit him first, familiar in so many ways. Blood, flesh and fire\u2014no matter how far man progressed, the smell of a battlefield was still the same. But there was more than the physical smell to this battlefield. He was a vampire lord, and these were his people. Their terror was an acrid taste on the back of his tongue, their deaths a deafening scream in his mind, an ache in his heart.</p><p>He scanned the Minnetonka enclave as the helicopter descended. It wasn\u2019t a single structure but a walled compound, with several buildings gathered around the central hall. Some of the smaller structures were individual homes, while other, larger buildings were shared by several vampires. The wall had been breached, but he knew that. The attackers had blown through the sturdy gate, which had never been intended to withstand an attack of this nature. It was designed to keep the vampires safe from human intrusion and curiosity. And until today, it had never been called on to do anything more.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Nicholas shouted as they hovered well off the ground, preparatory to landing. \u201cLet me go ahead\u2014\u201d</p><p>That was all Lucas heard as he leapt to the ground and raced toward the battle, his vampire speed taking him out from under the whirring rotor of the descending craft. In a split second, he identified his own vampires, separating them in his mind\u2019s eye from those sent by Klemens. He ripped into the first enemy with a roar, tearing him bodily off the male vampire he was fighting and ripping his head from his body with a vicious twist. He tossed the two pieces aside and kept going.</p><p>\u201cInside, my lord,\u201d someone shouted, and Lucas\u2019s head turned, following the voice as he kept moving. \u201cThe main house, Sire!\u201d Lucas recognized Thad, bleeding and broken, in a fight for his life. He started toward him to help, but Nicholas appeared out of nowhere, stepping between Thad and the brute he\u2019d been holding off despite being outclassed by fifty pounds or more.</p> <p>Lucas raced into the main building, taking the outside stairs at a single leap and bursting through the door. Time seemed to slow as he took in the huge room with a sweeping scan. Blood and bodies were everywhere. A battle raged at the foot of the big staircase, and he recognized twelve-year-old Dex holding a thick-bladed ax, tears rolling down his cheeks as he swung the heavy weapon in a wide arc, trying to hold off the two hulking vampires who were toying with him. What the hell was Dex\u2014</p><p>A very human scream sounded from upstairs, and Lucas understood. Dex\u2019s head swung toward the sound, and one of the enemy vamps grabbed the ax, yanking it from Dex\u2019s hand, nearly pulling the boy with it. The brute reached for the human child, but his fingers never made it that far. Lucas rammed his fist into the vampire\u2019s back and tore his spine in two. Before the injured vampire had even begun to collapse, Lucas had taken out his sadistic buddy, as well, lifting him bodily and tossing him in the direction of the door where Lucas\u2019s fresh and bloodthirsty warriors were following in their master\u2019s wake.</p><p>\u201cWatch the boy,\u201d Lucas growled and tore up the stairs faster than the human eye could follow.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to look for the attackers; he followed the scent of blood. Human blood. The women had been gathered upstairs. For safety, no doubt. Thad and his troops had made their last stand in this building, and God knew they\u2019d lasted longer than anyone had the right to expect. But it hadn\u2019t been enough.</p><p>Lucas rounded a corner and howled furiously at the sight that greeted him. He\u2019d feared a bloodbath awaited him, and there was blood enough. But it was savagery of a different sort that caused it. Klemens\u2019s vampires had attacked the compound\u2019s women and raped at will, while their allies held off the defending males down below. And the rapists were still at it. Lucas\u2019s rage sent waves of power coursing through the entire house, rattling the walls and shattering windows. The two vampires he\u2019d caught in the act jumped up, ready to fight until they saw whom they were facing. They stumbled back then, edging toward the windows in their desperation to escape. But there was no escape. Not for the murderers of innocent civilians. And not for rapists.</p><p>Lucas advanced slowly, holding the two attackers in place with a thought. He felt more than heard some of his own vampires enter the room and spoke without turning. \u201cGet the women out of here. Gently.\u201d</p><p>The women whimpered in fear when Lucas\u2019s vampires approached them, and he spared a wisp of power to send them all into sleep. He would speak to Thad when this was over and recommend the leader permit him to wipe the women\u2019s memories of the events in this room. Not the attack. People had died here today. There could be no forgetting that. But these women didn\u2019t need to remember the rest of it. Not if they didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>He focused again on the two enemy vampires now cringing before him, trying to shrink into the floor itself. They were covered in the blood of their victims, fangs fully distended, and they were both huge. Taller even than Lucas, and far more heavily muscled. The vampires in the yard had been the same. Klemens had apparently been gathering thugs for some time, preparing an army for the day he would make his move. Lucas sneered privately. It would take more than a few slabs of beef to win this war.</p> <p>He crouched in front of the nearest attacker. He hadn\u2019t touched the vamp yet, but then he didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>\u201cWhat were your orders?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The vampire had the good sense to shake his head. He might be terrified of Lucas, but Klemens was no one to cross lightly either.</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d Lucas asked, addressing the second prisoner.</p><p>Clearly emboldened by his fellow thug\u2019s success, he too shook his head and uttered a grunting sort of noise that Lucas took for a negative.</p><p>Lucas bared his teeth. \u201cOh, I so hoped you\u2019d feel that way. Nicholas,\u201d he called over his shoulder, having felt his lieutenant enter the room. \u201cAsk Thad if he has a soundproofed room where I can converse with these two. If not . . .\u201d Lucas turned back and eyed the captives lazily. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to rip out their vocal cords and take the truth from their tiny brains . . . after we play a bit, of course. I bet Thad and his people would love to spend some quality time with them first.\u201d</p><p>One of the vampires whined in fear. Lucas studied the bastard as he would a piece of shit on his heel. \u201cYou\u2019d rather I kill you quick?\u201d</p><p>The vampire nodded, his eyes begging for mercy. But Lucas only laughed. \u201cWhere would be the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Kathryn turned off the alarm on her cell phone before it could ring. Despite what she\u2019d thought the night before, there hadn\u2019t been any flights into Minneapolis until this morning. So she\u2019d booked the first one at six o\u2019clock this morning, and then gone looking for a gym to work off some of her nervous energy. That had been a bust, too. She\u2019d driven up and down every street before admitting a 24-hour FitnessCenter wasn\u2019t going to materialize on the next corner. She could have driven to Spearfish, or even Rapid City, but that was a good hour\u2019s drive each way, and she hadn\u2019t been that eager to work out. She\u2019d finally stopped at the local Starbuck\u2019s\u2014apparently there was no town too small for Starbuck\u2019s\u2014and forced herself to stick to decaf coffee while using their Wi-Fi connection to dig up what she could on Carmichael and his gallery. That hadn\u2019t taken much time, and without caffeine there didn\u2019t seem to be much point to the coffee, so she\u2019d gone back to the motel and tried to grab a few hours of sleep. She didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d bothered. Every time she closed her eyes, the facts of Daniel\u2019s case would appear\u2014her personal checklist imprinted on the inside of her eyelids, with every item checked off and the inescapable conclusion that she still knew absolutely nothing.</p><p>And if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, when she managed to erase the checklist, it was only to be replaced by an endless loop of speculation as to where Lucas had been off to in such a rush last night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rolled out of bed, booted up her laptop and immediately began searching law enforcement databases for reports of recent and unusual violence. That made for a pretty broad search, but she didn\u2019t know what she was looking for. She narrowed the time window to the last twelve hours, which helped a little, and limited the search further to cities within a helicopter ride of her current location. That was more problematic, since it depended on the equipment, and there was always the possibility they\u2019d refueled somewhere. But even eliminating that possibility, the target area was so big that it was impossible to weed out any one violent event from another. America was a violent country. On any given night in a major city, there were too many crimes to count. Add in the problem of smaller jurisdictions that were represented in the search parameters, and it was the proverbial needle in a haystack. Worse, she didn\u2019t even know if it was a needle or not.</p><p>Giving that up as a lost cause, she took a quick shower and got dressed. She didn\u2019t bother to pack, taking only her briefcase, with her laptop inside. And her weapon, of course, which she wore in her belt holster. Everything else she left in the motel. Since she hadn\u2019t been able to fly out last night, she\u2019d have to make it a day trip, coming back in time tonight to meet Lucas for their visit to . . . what did Lucas call it? A blood house. Great.</p><p>Her flight this morning would get her into Minneapolis just after noon. She could go directly to the gallery, talk to the owner if he was available, or his staff if he wasn\u2019t around. Three hours later, she\u2019d be on her return flight, arriving in plenty of time to do some bloody clubbing with vampires.</p> <p>Kathryn stared at the sign in the art gallery window in disbelief. Closed for lunch? Who the hell closed for lunch? And for two hours? She looked around the busy Minneapolisstreet to verify that she was indeed in a big American city and not somewhere in Europe where the two-hour, everything-shuts-down-for-lunch break was the norm.</p><p>She checked her watch. There was one hour left before the gallery would reopen. A gust of wind blew down the wide street, and she shivered, pulling her jacket closer as she searched the surrounding area for a way to kill an hour. Her gaze fell on the huge Mall of America in the distance, and she groaned inwardly. She hated shopping. But according to Lucas, she needed something appropriate to wear tonight, and a warmer jacket would be useful, too. She sighed and headed for her car with dragging steps.</p><p>An hour later on the dot, she was back, sliding her rental sedan into a parking space on the street which opened up just as she cruised past. Taking that as a good sign, she was feeling optimistic when she pulled open the heavy glass door on the gallery. It was fairly typical inside, with pale walls and track lighting which could be maneuvered to accommodate the varying shows over time. Floating walls hung blankly in midair, and Kathryn wondered if they were in the process of transitioning to a new showing.</p><p>The sharp click of high heels sounded on the hardwood floor, and Kathryn turned to find an intensely fashionable woman bearing down on her. She was older than Kathryn by at least ten years, with straight black hair parted in the middle and brushing her shoulders. Her makeup was perfect, her skin so pale Kathryn would have thought her one of Lucas\u2019s gang, if not for the bright sunlight beaming outside the UV protected windows. Contact lenses changed what Kathryn thought were probably brown eyes into a brilliant turquoise that nature had never produced in the human eye.</p><p>A tight pencil skirt forced the woman to walk with mincingly short steps as she approached Kathryn. \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d she said in a pleasant but sophisticatedly cool voice. \u201cAnd welcome to the Carmichael. How can I help you?\u201d</p> <p>Kathryn smiled back and produced her FBI identification. \u201cSpecial Agent Kathryn Hunter. Is Mister Carmichael around?\u201d</p><p>The woman studied the badge carefully before switching her gaze to Kathryn and saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mister Carmichael isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you expect him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t. Mister Carmichael isn\u2019t in town this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand he has a gallery besides this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, his main base of operations is the gallery in Chicago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Chicago then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say for certain. Mister Carmichael doesn\u2019t need to clear his schedule with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you wanted to get in touch with him, that\u2019s where you\u2019d start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted to reach Mister Carmichael, Agent, I\u2019d call his cell phone,\u201d the woman drawled, as if explaining the marvels of modern technology to an idiot.</p><p>Kathryn studied the other woman silently. Long enough that she finally reached up with nervous fingers to straighten her already perfect hair. \u201cWas there something else?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kathryn said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancoise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancoise? That\u2019s it? Like Cher?\u201d</p> <p>Francoise pursed her lips unhappily, which wasn\u2019t kind to her perfect makeup, revealing a starburst of unattractive creases around her lips that made Kathryn up her estimate of the woman\u2019s age by another ten years.</p><p>\u201cFrancoise Reyos,\u201d she said grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cI notice you\u2019ve recently taken down a collection, Francoise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a series of photographs by Daniel Hunter,\u201d she said, her expression suddenly animated. \u201cA talented photographer and very popular with our clients. Not to mention a handsome and charming man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him well, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Not as well as Alex knows him, of course, but we\u2019re very friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex?\u201d Kathryn repeated, trying to keep her voice from giving away the fact that the name meant anything special to her, that this was the name of the vampire who Daniel had been seen leaving with.</p><p>\u201cI meant Mister Carmichael, of course. Alex Carmichael.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn froze. Her research had listed the owner as George A. Carmichael, but both Magda and Lucas had been careful to call him only by his last name. Lucas had known she was looking for an Alex, and he wasn\u2019t stupid. He had to know Alex Carmichael would immediately jump to the top of her list. So, why hadn\u2019t he mentioned it?</p><p>And here she\u2019d begun to think of him as a friend, maybe more. That lying bastard.</p><p>Francoise was staring at her worriedly, and Kathryn immediately banished all thoughts of Lucas. She\u2019d deal with him later. She forced herself back to the present.</p><p>\u201cWill Alex be around tomorrow morning, by any chance?\u201d she asked Francoise, wondering if the woman knew her boss was a vampire.</p><p>Francoise dropped her eyes and looked away before answering. \u201cI don\u2019t expect him back before tomorrow evening at the earliest. Evening is our busiest time. That\u2019s when Alex likes to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Do you happen to have a photograph of Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brochure,\u201d Francoise said brightly, and hurried over to a narrow table of blond wood against one of the floating walls. Kathryn followed, taking one step for every two of Francoise\u2019s in her tight skirt. The gallery assistant picked up what looked more like a booklet than a brochure and flipped it open to an inside page.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Alex,\u201d she said with some pride and pointed at a color photograph of a handsome middle-aged man with silvery blond hair. The title under the photo identified him as G. Alexander Carmichael.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the G stand for?\u201d Kathryn asked.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Francoise murmured, leaning in conspiratorially. \u201cIt\u2019s George, but he hates that name. It\u2019s on all the legal sorts of documents, but he never uses it. It\u2019s always Alex.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s heart skipped a beat. The witness had described \u201cAlex\u201d as blond and older, but to a twenty-year-old Marine corporal, middle-aged probably was older. And Alex Carmichael was definitely blond. There were too many coincidences here to ignore.</p><p>\u201cDo you have Alex\u2019s cell number handy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Francoise looked as if she wanted to say no, but that would have been foolish. She\u2019d just admitted having the number not five minutes earlier. So she nodded sharply and minced away on her skinny heels, walking over to a minimalist glass desk and retrieving a business card from an elegant mother-of-pearl box.</p><p>She held the card out to Kathryn, who\u2019d followed her to the desk. Kathryn studied the card before tucking it into her pocket.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Francoise. If Mister Carmichael calls, don\u2019t tell him, or anyone else, that I was looking for him.\u201d</p><p>Francoise appeared surprised by the request. She nodded, but Kathryn saw the rebellion in her eyes and knew she was lying. The minute Kathryn walked out the door, Francoise would be on the phone leaving a message for her vampire boss.</p><p>And speaking of vampires, Lucas had a few lies to answer for. Maybe he knew far more than he was saying about other things, too. Like what had happened to her brother and where Daniel was right now.</p><p>Kathryn threw her bags down on the bed when she returned to the motel, still debating whether or not to go to the club without Lucas. Her flight had been delayed on the ground in Minneapolis longer than it took to fly back to Rapid City. She\u2019d raged privately, but there was no sense in yelling at the gate attendant as she\u2019d seen a couple of businessmen doing. After all, the poor woman had nothing to do with the delay, nor could she magically conjure up a new plane just to be sure those two assholes got home in time for dinner.</p><p>The plane had finally taken off, but it was nearly ten p.m. by the time she walked back into the small town motel room she shared with Daniel\u2019s clothes and equipment. She\u2019d left several messages for Lucas, both before leaving Minneapolis and once she was back on the ground, but he hadn\u2019t returned any of her calls. She checked her phone one more time, half-expecting to find a message from him canceling their appointment. She had no doubt that the ever helpful Francoise, or her boss Alex, had made sure Lucas knew Kathryn had visited the gallery and now knew about Alex Carmichael.</p><p>She\u2019d hoped he wouldn\u2019t cancel, though. Hoped that he was arrogant enough to bluff his way through. Because while she intended to have it out with him about Carmichael, she still needed him to make sure that she not only got into the club tonight, but that his people answered her questions. Once that was done, she could confront him about what he knew. Two could play at lies and half-truths. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But since Lucas hadn\u2019t bothered to call, she now had to decide whether to try the club without him. She had no guarantee he would still hold to their agreement, even if he showed up. And now that she knew about Carmichael, he might decide to send her off on a wild goose chase while he covered his vampire buddy\u2019s ass.</p><p>That decided it for her. She wasn\u2019t waiting for Lucas or anyone else. This was America, and she was, by God, a sworn federal officer. She was going to that club tonight, and she was going to get the answers she needed, or she\u2019d arrest everyone and shut the whole damn thing down.</p><p>\u201cDamn right!\u201d she shouted, pumping her arm once in an act of defiance. She caught sight of herself in the mirror and started laughing. Okay, so maybe she couldn\u2019t shut the club down, but she could and would go there and ask some questions. And she definitely wouldn\u2019t be waiting for that snake Lucas to do it.</p> <p>Lucas stormed into his office, still wearing the bloody leathers from last night\u2019s battle. He\u2019d been forced to sleep through the day at the Minneapolis house, along with the survivors from Minnetonka. The enclave had been too badly damaged for the vampires\u2019 safety, and the humans had been too shattered by the violence to stay there anyway. The enclave would be rebuilt, maybe even in that location. But it would take time, and Thad and his people would need that time to heal themselves. Lives had been lost last night. Granted the enemy had lost far more, but that was little comfort to the dead or those who\u2019d loved them.</p><p>The attack had taught Lucas a hard lesson. No one was safe in this war, not when Klemens was willing to reduce himself to the brutality of human warfare, not when innocent civilians were targets, and rape was an acceptable weapon.</p><p>Lucas hadn\u2019t wanted to remain in Minneapolis after the battle, but it had taken several hours to clean up the scene in Minnetonka sufficiently to avoid scrutiny by the human authorities. The compound hadn\u2019t had any close neighbors, but it had been necessary to repair the worst of the damage to the wall and, especially, to remove the human bodies. The vampire bodies had taken care of themselves, but there was no concealing the destruction of the buildings. Klemens\u2019s people had done Lucas a favor by torching everything. It made the damage easier to explain and provided an excuse for the sudden absence of people living there. But the fire had also drawn a crowd. Fortunately, the relatively remote location meant it was a small crowd, but Lucas had been forced to manipulate their memories to support his preferred version of the events.</p><p>Between that and getting everyone to safety in Minneapolis, then meeting with Thad and several of Lucas\u2019s people, there\u2019d been no time to return to the ranch before dawn. His only other choice would have been flying home with a human pilot at the controls, traveling through the daylight hours and sleeping at the airport until sunset. He hated that idea on two fronts. One was his personal paranoia, inherited from his Sire, Raphael, about putting a human solely in charge of his safety. And the other was his aversion to sleeping on the plane at all.</p><p>He had a penthouse in St. Paul where he usually stayed when visiting the Twin Cities, but time had been so short this morning that he hadn\u2019t bothered with that, either. He\u2019d ended up spending the daylight hours in one of the bedrooms of the Minneapolis HQ vault, and flown back to the ranch this evening. It hadn\u2019t been that simple, of course. He\u2019d had to meet with Thad again before leaving, and he\u2019d made a series of phone calls to the leaders of his other regional nests, advising them of Klemens\u2019s new and dangerous tactic. He\u2019d ordered them to get the word out to the civilians in their areas.</p> <p>On any other night, Lucas would have lingered in Minneapolis even longer, but he had a nagging feeling that his favorite FBI agent wouldn\u2019t hang around waiting for him to escort her to the club. After his abrupt departure the previous night, she\u2019d probably spent all day today chomping at the bit, cursing vampires in general and him specifically. But despite all of that, he still had one more call to make before he called Kathryn.</p><p>He circled his desk and lifted the receiver of an ordinary-looking phone sitting on the elegant credenza behind his desk. It was a landline, and in lighter moments, Lucas jokingly referred to it as the bat phone. It had only seven numbers stored in its memory, the numbers of his seven fellow vampire lords, and it was rarely used. Vampire lords tended to be hostile toward one another, which meant there were no chatty catch-up phone calls on this line. On the occasions when Lucas wanted to catch up with Raphael or Duncan, he used their personal cell phones. The landline was for emergencies and warnings. Like the one he was about to give Klemens.</p><p>Lucas waited until he heard Klemens\u2019s hated voice, then snarled, \u201cRape, you son of a bitch? That\u2019s what you\u2019ve come to?\u201d</p><p>Klemens laughed. \u201cWar is war, my dear Lucas, no matter the venue. But then you micks always worry too much about protecting the ladies.\u201d</p><p>Lucas ground his teeth. \u201cThose women were mated to vampires,\u201d he snarled. \u201cMy vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought they were simply whores brought in to amuse,\u201d Klemens drawled, not even pretending he hadn\u2019t ordered the atrocity.</p> <p>\u201cWell, know this, asshole. There is no mercy for rapists. You\u2019re officially thirteen vampires shorter tonight. Your army is shrinking, Klemens, and that means I\u2019m one step closer to you. It\u2019s time to start saying your farewells to anyone foolish enough to care for you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas slammed the phone down so hard it cracked the base. \u201cFuck!\u201d he spat and swept the damn thing to the floor in frustrated rage, spinning with a snarl when his office door opened.</p><p>Nicholas took one look and froze in place.</p><p>\u201cI want a fucking target,\u201d Lucas ordered. \u201cKlemens is staging his people somewhere along the border. I want it found, damn it. No civilians, but it has to hurt. I\u2019m tired of reacting and letting that bastard set the pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Nick was still in the doorway, eyeing Lucas as if waiting for the other foot to come crashing down on him. Lucas rubbed a weary hand over his face and waved him inside. Nick looked even worse than Lucas felt. Like Lucas, he\u2019d changed his shirt, but still wore the torn and bloody leathers from the previous night. Unlike Lucas, he\u2019d also been severely wounded. One of Klemens\u2019s vamps had gotten lucky and ripped Nick\u2019s jaw open to his teeth. The deep, raw-looking laceration traveled from the outside corner of his eye down to the curve of his jaw bone. The fact that it wasn\u2019t healed more than twelve hours after the injury spoke to how serious it had been. Still, one more day, and it would be a healing pink scar. A day or so after that, and Nick\u2019s cheek would once again be without blemish. The healing would have gone even faster, if Lucas had been able to give Nick some of his blood to drink. But in times like this, when an attack could come from anywhere at any time, it wasn\u2019t wise to weaken himself even the slightest bit unless the need was critical.</p><p>\u201cFucking Klemens doesn\u2019t even pretend to apologize for his rapists,\u201d Lucas said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAt least it proves what we already suspected, my lord. That he gave the specific orders.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, he gave them all right. Bastard bragged about it.\u201d Lucas collapsed onto his desk chair, falling hard enough that it skidded back a few inches. \u201cSit, Nick. And stop with the my lord bullshit. I\u2019m not gonna hurt anyone, especially not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief,\u201d Magda drawled as she strolled into his office. She crossed to the desk and propped a hip on the edge, her narrow skirt sliding up to reveal an expanse of toned thigh as she turned to look at him. \u201cAgent Hunter called this evening. Several times.\u201d</p><p>Lucas swore softly. He probably should have called her from the plane, but he didn\u2019t want the FBI to know his business and figured it was at least possible she\u2019d have known he was in the air. Grabbing his cell phone, he pulled up her number, checking the time as he did so. Just past eleven. Damn it, he was late. Kathryn\u2019s phone was ringing for the third time. Surely, she wouldn\u2019t have\u2014</p><p>\u201cKathryn Hunter,\u201d she answered in a cool voice. Lucas rolled his eyes. She had to know it was him calling, since his number would have come up on her Caller ID.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Kathryn. It\u2019s Lucas,\u201d he said, identifying himself needlessly, and playing along with her little game. \u201cLook, something fairly serious came up. We\u2019ll have to do the club tomorrow night, instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right. I\u2019m already here.\u201d</p><p>Lucas pulled the phone away and stared at it, wondering if he\u2019d heard correctly. He brought it back to his ear. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the club,\u201d she said loudly, enunciating each word, as if she honestly believed he hadn\u2019t been able to hear her. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m just about to go inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad idea, Kathryn,\u201d he said, striving for calm, although his brain was screaming at her to get the fuck out of there. His warriors were about to descend on that club. They were fresh from the battlefield, high on the defeat of their enemies, looking for the blood and sex release they hadn\u2019t had time to get last night . . . and there she\u2019d be\u2014one righteous, blond FBI agent directly in their path.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she mimicked archly.</p><p>\u201cBad. Idea,\u201d he repeated, trying not to snarl, knowing intuitively that if he got angry or demanding, it would have the opposite effect he wanted.</p><p>But she only laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll manage, Lucas. This isn\u2019t exactly my first rodeo.\u201d</p><p>Lucas said a quick prayer for patience. \u201cKathryn,\u201d he began, then stopped in disbelief. She\u2019d hung up on him! Lucas shouted wordlessly and threw the phone across the room, raging. No one fucking hung up on him. Ever!</p><p>Even worse, now he\u2019d have to drag his ass to that stupid club, or Kathryn was going to end up as someone\u2019s dinner. He had a sudden image of her pressed up against a wall, legs spread, her arms around some hulking vampire\u2019s back while that vampire bent his head to her neck and\u2014 Oh, hell, no!</p><p>\u201cNick, we\u2019re leaving in five.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Magda demanded impatiently, her vampire hearing having given her both sides of the conversation. \u201cShe\u2019s a big girl, and no one forced her to go there alone. Let her deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a great idea, Magda,\u201d he snapped, an Irish lilt flavoring his words as it always did when he got angry enough. \u201cLet\u2019s send the fucking FBI agent into one of our blood houses to be blooded and possibly assaulted by a battle-raged vampire or two. Fucking fantastic.\u201d He leaned across the desk until he was only inches away from the female vamp who was his lawyer. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your problem is with Kathryn, but you need to deal with it and do your job.\u201d</p><p>Magda flushed red with anger and embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you my problem,\u201d she shouted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you with a lot of women, hundreds of fucking women. And not one of them has ever mattered to you. But this one does, and I don\u2019t like it. She\u2019s dangerous. Not just to you, but to the rest of us, and you don\u2019t seem to give a shit about it!\u201d</p> <p>Lucas straightened to his full height and stared at her coldly. Magda paled, suddenly realizing she\u2019d gone too far. She slid to her knees and glanced up at him once before lowering her gaze to the floor. In that brief flash of her dark eyes, he\u2019d seen his own reflection, his eyes burning gold with power.</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting I don\u2019t protect what is mine?\u201d he asked in a dangerously calm voice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Magda whispered instantly. \u201cNo, my lord, please. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d</p><p>Magda\u2019s words were choked off on a sob.</p> <p>\u201cFor the sake of our history together, I\u2019ve indulged your petty jealousies, Magda. I now see that was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze to his, unable to speak, her dark eyes beseeching.</p><p>\u201cIt may be time for you to try your skills elsewhere. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have time for this now. You\u2019re excused for the evening. I\u2019ll send word tomorrow as to your new assignment.\u201d He waved his hand, lifting the compulsion and permitting her to speak, then turning his back and walking away.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d she sobbed behind him, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>Lucas stopped and turned enough to give her a silent look. Magda immediately cast her eyes back to the carpet, biting her lips to stifle her sobs. Lucas strode out of his office, taking the side door that led to his private quarters. Once out of sight, he picked up his pace. He had to get to the club before Kathryn, or someone else, did something he couldn\u2019t undo.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p> <p>Kathryn acknowledged that she hadn\u2019t been quite honest with Lucas. When he\u2019d called her, she\u2019d just been turning into the club\u2019s parking lot and could easily have waited for him. But his high-handed attitude that she would rearrange everything to suit his schedule had pissed her off even more than being stood up, so she bent the truth just a bit. Besides, as she\u2019d told him, this wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d gone to a potentially hostile location to interview witnesses. It might have gone smoother with Lucas at hand, but it was doable with or without him.</p><p>She grabbed her FBI ID and headed for the front of the club, only to be confronted by a long line of people waiting to get in. Both men and women were there, although significantly more women than men. And despite various styles of dress, they all had one thing in common\u2014there wasn\u2019t a covered neck among them, with most baring a hell of a lot more than just their necks. She eyed some of the women, with their swooping necklines and tiny skirts, and recalled what Lucas had said about clubs like this. The vamps took blood from human partners and gave them a mind-blowing sexual experience in return. She looked again at one or two of those butt-cheek-baring skirts and decided she didn\u2019t want to know what else those women were or were not wearing.</p><p>Not wanting anyone to mistake her own purpose in being there, she made one small change in her own attire. Walking back to her SUV, she pulled open her cargo hatch and debated her options. The only clothes she had with her were the ones in her gym bag, which were left over from her futile search for a place to work out yesterday. She unzipped the bag and pulled out a pair of plain, black leggings, slipping them on under the black knit cocktail dress she\u2019d bought in Minneapolis. The dress was wool, with simple, straight lines, long sleeves and a modest boat neck. It was a little more form fitting than she\u2019d normally wear, but at least the hemline fell closer to her knees than her ass. And the belted waist gave her a place to anchor the clip-on holster for her Glock. She hadn\u2019t been sure when she bought the dress whether she\u2019d be carrying a sidearm into the club, but now she was glad for her foresight. Not wanting to advertise the gun\u2019s presence, however, she pulled her black jacket back on over everything, concealing both the weapon and the clingy fit of the dress. Unfortunately, there was nothing she could do about her shoes, since her only alternative was the gym shoes from her bag. And since she had to get in the club\u2019s front door, she didn\u2019t think that would work. Most places like this\u2014by which she meant trendy clubs, not specifically vampire clubs since she\u2019d never been to one\u2014had informal dress codes with the bouncer at the door having complete discretion about who got in. She could only imagine that the door guy at a vamp club would be even more selective, and somehow she didn\u2019t think clunky athletic shoes and a black dress would cut it.</p><p>Even the leggings were pushing it, but if worse came to worst, she could badge her way in. She hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that, though. Contrary to what Lucas seemed to think, Kathryn didn\u2019t plan on thumping tables and demanding answers. She could be subtle when she needed to be.</p><p>Her worries about passing the bouncer\u2019s inspection proved unfounded once she got to the door. The bouncer at Lucas\u2019s club was big. Not just tall, but thickly muscled with arms that bulged around a black T-shirt which seemed too insubstantial for the cold weather. And apparently he was perceptive, too, because he spotted her as a cop the minute she bypassed the long line of customers and stepped up to him.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the club, officer.\u201d He laughed and dropped the velvet rope, which should have made Kathryn happy. But his laugh sounded more like a warning, something cynical, and knowing that had made her instantly suspicious.</p><p>She considered turning around and walking away right then and there, but she was too stubborn to give up that easily, thereby effectively admitting that Lucas had been right. So, instead, she flashed her FBI badge and said, \u201cI\u2019m not a cop.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cClose enough, sweetheart. Don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d consider turning over your weapon?\u201d</p> <p>It was Kathryn\u2019s turn to laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured.\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn pulled out her brother\u2019s picture and showed it to him.</p><p>\u201cYou ever seen him before?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at the photo almost dismissively and then frowned in surprise. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t know his name, but he\u2019s been here a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice,\u201d Kathryn clarified. \u201cAll of these people coming and going, but you remember this one?\u201d</p><p>The bouncer shrugged, massive shoulders moving up and down. \u201cBecause he had a camera with him. We don\u2019t usually allow customers to bring cameras into the club, not even cell phones.\u201d He gestured to a table where new arrivals were turning over purses and turning out pockets. They were also signing some sort of form, but she couldn\u2019t read what it was from where she stood.</p><p>\u201cThis guy,\u201d the bouncer indicated Daniel\u2019s picture, \u201chad a camera around his neck, and not the touristy kind with point and shoot, either. I told him he\u2019d have to check it, and he balked. Said it was too expensive. Anyway, it was early, and we weren\u2019t crowded yet. The boss happened to see what was going on and told me it was okay, that your guy was some sort of famous photographer.\u201d He shrugged again. \u201cSo I let him in. Same thing the next night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago? Maybe a little more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever see him leave with anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, I keep people from sneaking in, not going home.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn sighed. She\u2019d known it wouldn\u2019t be that easy. \u201cOkay. So, who\u2019s your boss, and where can I find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cName\u2019s Kurt, and he\u2019s in the same place he is every night we\u2019re open. Behind the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn bypassed the check-in tables and strolled into the dimly lit bar, trying to conceal the fact that she wanted to gawk like a tourist. Lucas had described what they did at these clubs, but that hadn\u2019t prepared her for the reality of it. The place was crowded enough that she wondered about the fire code, and everywhere she looked people were going at it with each other. On the dance floor, in the booths hugging the walls, and in dark corners sporadically lit by twisting lights in the ceiling. Some were engaged in sexual acts that would have gotten them arrested anywhere else, while others . . . She stared despite herself as a vampire lifted his mouth from a woman\u2019s neck, eyes rolling up to meet Kathryn\u2019s shocked gaze as he licked the twin puncture wounds and then his own lips, as if savoring the flavor of a rich wine.</p><p>Kathryn averted her gaze quickly, but not before she saw the vampire\u2019s fangs flash in a mocking grin. Determined to do what she\u2019d come for and leave, she made her way through the crowded club, surrounded by sweaty, horny humans and way too many hungry vampires. The music was incredibly loud, the pulsing bass so persistent that she had to fight the urge to put her hands over her ears and wince like some cranky old lady. In order to get to the bar, she had to ford the edge of the dance floor, which meant being jostled from all sides until she was ready to pull her gun and scream at the top of her lungs for everyone to get the hell out of the way! Including\u2014no, especially\u2014a particularly clueless testosterone jockey who absolutely refused to take a fucking hint and move along.</p><p>In her mind, she\u2019d conjured up an image of the club filled with Emo-styled, twenty-something vampires. She knew the sort of places her brother preferred when he went clubbing\u2014at least she thought she did\u2014and this wasn\u2019t it. These guys looked more like Dwayne Johnson clones who\u2019d overdosed on Viagra. And the way they were humping the mostly female patrons, she didn\u2019t think too many of them would be attracted to her brother, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The place was creepy, and maybe a little frightening, although she wasn\u2019t going to admit that, even to herself. And she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to leave before talking to the bossman behind the bar who\u2019d known her brother well enough to recognize him from across the room.</p><p>Kathryn finally squirmed her way out of the mass of dancers, feeling like she\u2019d been squeezed out of . . . okay, not a pleasant thought. Not gonna go there.</p><p>She made her way around to the service bar and caught the nearest bartender\u2019s eye. There were three of them back there. Two were working the bar itself, while the third appeared to concentrate on filling orders from the beleaguered wait staff.</p> <p>Kathryn leaned across the bar to him and shouted, \u201cIs Kurt around?\u201d</p><p>The bartender winced, as if she\u2019d hurt his ears by yelling. But even a vampire had to be deaf with all the noise in here, so she figured the bartender knew who and what she was and was just being a prick about it.</p><p>He moved down to the opposite end of the bar and said something to one of the other bartenders. That guy turned, and Kathryn caught a brief flash of fang before he gave her a long look. After a moment, he said something to the prick and switched places with him.</p><p>As she watched the new guy making his way toward her, she noticed the original prick talking into a cell phone. It could have been coincidence, but somehow she didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kurt.\u201d</p> <p>Her attention was drawn back to the club manager. He was big and physically fit, like they all were, with blond hair and light-colored eyes that she assumed were blue, though it was hard to tell for sure in the dark club. He appeared to be in his early twenties, but appearances were irrelevant with vampires. He could be a couple of hundred years old, and he\u2019d look the same.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent\u2014\u201d she began and reached for her credentials, but he stopped her with a light touch on her arm.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you know who I am, then you know what I want. I\u2019m looking for Daniel Hunter. He was in this club, and you knew him well enough to tell your doorman to let him in with his camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow well did you know him?\u201d</p> <p>Kurt shrugged one shoulder. \u201cHe was only here a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>Interesting, Kathryn thought to herself. He\u2019d deflected her question while pretending to answer it.</p><p>\u201cDid you meet him here at the club?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an impatient look. \u201cLook. I\u2019m trying to find my brother. If you don\u2019t have anything to do with his disappearance, you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about from me. Where did you meet Daniel?\u201d</p><p>Kurt stared at her for a moment, then said, \u201cIn the Badlands. I like to hike, which means I hike at night, preferably when there\u2019s a little bit of moonlight to see by. I was out hiking last month, and I came across Dan shooting pictures of the park at night. We talked. I liked him.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn studied Kurt\u2019s closed down expression and realized something. Kurt didn\u2019t just like her brother, he liked him. And he was worried about him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea where he might be?\u201d</p> <p>Kurt shook his head. \u201cI wish I did, Agent Hunter. He came in here two nights in a row. When he didn\u2019t show up the next night, I thought he\u2019d gone backcountry again. He\u2019d already told me that he\u2019d only come into town for a hot shower and a few nights in a real bed, and then he was going out again after that. I figured I\u2019d find him on my next hike. But he wasn\u2019t there, and, believe me, I looked. I know that whole park better than just about anyone. And then the Sheriff started asking around, and the next thing I knew Lucas told me you were coming to town.\u201d</p><p>Kurt looked across the crowded club for a moment, then back at Kathryn. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to help you find him . . .\u201d</p><p>Kathryn smiled. Here, finally, was someone who was as worried about Daniel as she was.</p><p>On a whim, she pulled out the brochure from Alex Carmichael\u2019s gallery and showed him the owner\u2019s picture. \u201cHow about this guy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAlex? Yeah, sure. He\u2019s in here a couple of times a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he lived in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a place in Minneapolis, too. But he doesn\u2019t like to circulate in the cities where he works. Says he doesn\u2019t want everyone knowing his business, but I think he\u2019s just one of those guys who likes to go for a bit of strange sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange?\u201d</p><p>Kurt gave her a puzzled look, then laughed a little. \u201cStrange, as in not his usual partner, if you get my drift. I get the impression Alex has a steady squeeze back home, but he likes to play. So he comes here once in a while. We get humans from all over the state, especially in summer, and year-round there are two good-sized cities in easy driving distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Kathryn commented. She started to fold the brochure back into her pocket, but Kurt interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking Alex had something to do with Daniel being gone . . . I think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn tilted her head curiously. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and Daniel talked, but it was business. And like I said, Alex comes here to circulate. If he wanted Daniel, he didn\u2019t need to come here to get him.\u201d</p><p>She thought about it for a moment, then nodded and held out her hand. \u201cThanks for your help, Kurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. You should know . . . I haven\u2019t stopped looking for Dan. I think he\u2019s in this town somewhere, or if not that, then he\u2019s lost out in the Badlands. But if I\u2019m wrong, if you find him first, tell him to give me a ring and let me know he\u2019s okay. Now, I need to get you out of here, because this crowd is about to get pretty excited, and, believe me, you don\u2019t want to be here when that happens. Let me tell Gary, and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>While Kurt walked over to let the other bartender know he\u2019d be gone a few minutes, Kathryn eyed the gyrating couples already packed in like wiggling sardines and wondered how things could get any more excited than they already were. But she\u2019d gotten what she came for and had found an unexpected ally, too. So if that ally was telling her she should make like the birds, then she was ready to take his advice and get the flock out of there.</p><p>She turned back to see what was keeping Kurt and barely managed to dodge aside as a pair of howling vampires with a screaming woman between them shoved out of the crowd and into the bar, knocking aside several patrons who promptly yelled happily and joined in the mayhem. Kurt roared and started tossing bodies back into the crowd, but it was too late. One of the vamps slammed over the bar and crashed into the stock of liquor, breaking bottles and shattering glassware, and the scent of alcohol rose over the whole disastrous scene in a sickly sweet cloud.</p><p>Kathryn had backed away to the safety of a corner wall when the first trio had slammed into the bar, not wanting to get caught up in the violence. But now she stepped away from its relative protection and scanned the scene. It was obvious Kurt wasn\u2019t going to break free anytime soon, and compared to the brawl at this end of the bar, the rest of the crowded club seemed almost tame. She drew a deep breath and had just girded herself for a return trip through the mob, when there was a roar of male voices followed by the excited squeals of vampire groupies in heat, and everything went completely to hell.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Lucas was on his way to the club when Nicholas\u2019s cell phone rang. Mason was driving, and Nick was sitting up front in the passenger seat, but Lucas could clearly hear both sides of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cNick, where the hell is Lucas? We need him here now, man!\u201d It was Greg Monterossa, the doorman cum bouncer at the blood house. The very same blood house where Kathryn had defiantly gone without him.</p><p>\u201cGive me the phone, Nick,\u201d Lucas growled. Nick handed it back to him. \u201cWhat is it, Greg?\u201d he asked, even though he had a pretty damn good idea. Talk about the perfect storm. Combine one stubborn FBI agent and a bunch of adrenaline-driven vampire fighters, and he had a disaster in the making.</p><p>\u201cA bunch of the guys just showed up, juiced up from the fight and still reeking of blood. The crowd\u2019s going nuts with happiness, but that FBI chick is still in there somewhere, my lord,\u201d Greg added, clearly exasperated and striving not to show it. \u201cKurt tried to hustle her out first, but now he and the rest have their hands full, and I can\u2019t close the door, we\u2019ll have a full-on riot. You want me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s phone beeped with an incoming call. Lucas checked the ID and went back to Greg.</p><p>\u201cKurt\u2019s on the other line. Stay where you are; I\u2019m only a few minutes away from you.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected the doorman and brought up Kurt. \u201cI just spoke to Greg. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to get her out of here, Sire, but it all happened too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she has that effect. I\u2019ve got Nick and Mason with me. We\u2019ll be there in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d Mason provided from the front seat.</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Kurt said. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can from here.\u201d</p><p>Lucas disconnected and handed the phone over to Nick, considering his options. If there weren\u2019t so many humans involved, he could simply drop his vamps where they stood and put everyone to sleep. But if the club was as crowded as Greg indicated, there were probably as many humans as vamps, if not more. And he had no way of knowing what they\u2019d do if the vampires started passing out around them. Most of the humans were bound to be at least friendly, if not straight up groupies. But if only one or two were in the club for other reasons, if they maybe hoped to take down a vamp or two, instead of having a good time . . . well, a lot could happen in two minutes. And he wasn\u2019t about to leave his vampires helpless in an unknown situation.</p><p>Nick dropped the cell phone Lucas had been using into the SUV\u2019s center console, then looked over his shoulder and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for when we get there, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one plan, and that\u2019s to extricate Kathryn Hunter as quickly and bloodlessly as possible. As far as I\u2019m concerned, everyone else knew what they were signing up for when they walked into the club. But I don\u2019t think our Special Agent had a clue, and I\u2019d rather she not find out the hard way. I\u2019d hate for any of my warriors to end up paying the price for her stubbornness.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kathryn only wanted to get to the front door and get the hell out of this club. Like right now. But they wouldn\u2019t let her. Two large, sweaty, and she was pretty sure bloody, vampires had taken a liking to her and were now stopping her from leaving while they eyeballed each other in some sort of vampire pissing contest. She wasn\u2019t sure what they hoped to achieve since she certainly had no intention of spending any time with either of them, but every time she managed to inch in the direction of the door, one of them would shift to block her path. That wasn\u2019t difficult in the crowded room, especially not since all hell had broken loose once these two and their buddies joined the party. All of the other women in the room were literally throwing themselves at the new arrivals, but for some reason these two had declared war over her. She\u2019d tried showing them her badge and demanding they get the fuck out of her way, but they\u2019d barely glanced at it before going back to their growling contest. Apparently, the prize, i.e. Kathryn, didn\u2019t have any say in the matter.</p><p>Kathryn was irritated and somewhat puzzled by this turn of events, but not all that worried. Either they didn\u2019t believe she was actually FBI, or they thought it was all a game, an interesting new bit of foreplay before the big finale. She, at least, knew that wasn\u2019t the case, but she was still trying to decide the best way to extricate herself from the situation. She was reluctant to pull her weapon in such a crowded room, especially with the testosterone level as high as it was. And that was her last choice anyway. She had no doubt she could escape any attempt to control her physically. Vampires were amazingly strong, but she didn\u2019t need to defeat them on points, she only needed to get away. And she had no intention of being anyone\u2019s dinner and/or bedmate tonight.</p><p>When one of her suitors made a grab for her left arm, Kathryn decided she\u2019d had enough. She slipped her right hand inside her jacket, and had managed to unsnap the safety strap on her sidearm when the two vampires suddenly began bumping into each other aggressively, like two wooly mammoths battling for supremacy. Kathryn squeaked\u2014and thank God no one could hear that over the general noise\u2014and ducked down, lest she be crushed between the two behemoths. They began snarling, muscles bunching across their huge chests and arms, fangs blatantly displayed and gleaming in the low light. Under other circumstances, she might have been intrigued by that development. Where had the fangs come from? And how did they deploy them? Was it any intense emotion that did it? Or did it have to be intentional?</p> <p>But then the two huge vampires went after each other, and she was roughly shoved out of the way. Kathryn glanced around, but no one else seemed to care. There were a few screams and some grunts of displeasure, but they were lost in the general mayhem. And everyone adapted fairly quickly, shuffling aside and giving the combatants room to figure out whose dick was bigger, or whatever the hell they were fighting about.</p><p>Kathryn, on the other hand, saw this as her chance to escape. She spun around and was heading straight for the door with long purposeful strides when a wall of solid muscle stepped into her path. She looked up into a pair of glowing red eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re battling over you,\u201d the new vampire said, lisping slightly around his very visible fangs. This close up, she could see the tight pink flesh of his gums stretching around the tops of the unique teeth. The vamp was smaller than the other two, his height almost identical to hers with the heels, but his shoulders were thick and broad, and he had a deep barrel chest. He grinned at her, and Kathryn fought the urge to grin back. She had to fight it too hard, actually. She\u2019d heard stories of vampires\u2019 ability to project emotion and thought and wondered if that was happening here, or if this guy was just naturally charismatic. But whichever it was, Kathryn wanted no part of it.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said pleasantly and started to go around the newcomer.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cPlaying hard to get, Blondie? Not nice. No one likes a fang teaser.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes narrowed in anger. \u201cGet out of my way. Now,\u201d she demanded and put her hand on the Glock where it rested on her right hip.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna shoot me with your little gun?\u201d he mocked.</p><p>Kathryn pulled and shoved the gun into his crotch. \u201cNo, I\u2019m gonna shoot your balls off with my little gun,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>He snarled and raised a hand as if to reach for her. Kathryn feared she really was going to have to shoot this idiot\u2019s nuts off, when a big hand grabbed the back of his neck and pulled him aside. The red-eyed vampire\u2019s first reaction was to yowl like a jungle cat, but then he froze, nearly choking himself on his own outrage as he stared up at the vampire who\u2019d grabbed him.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>Red Eyes disappeared into the crowd as Lucas turned his impatient stare on her instead. \u201cSpecial Agent Hunter,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she snapped at him, jamming her gun back into its holster. She started to shove past him, but he looped an arm around her waist and bent his mouth to her ear.</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to treat the person who just saved you from your own stupidity?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s jaw tightened, but she spun around with a smile and stretched up to put her lips against his ear in turn. \u201cWhy, Lord Donlon,\u201d she murmured. \u201cFirst you lie to me, then you stand me up, and now you call me stupid. How ever do the ladies resist you?\u201d The last few words were more of a snarl than a murmur.</p><p>She put both hands on his chest and shoved away from him, then stormed toward the exit, noticing that a pathway had magically opened between her and the front door. Probably more of Lucas\u2019s highhandedness. All of his people seemed terrified of him. Maybe he wrapped them in silver chains and made them sleep in their coffins if they were bad boys. She\u2019d read stuff like that in her research, although the sources were all fictional, so she was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t real. Especially since vampires weren\u2019t actually dead, which eliminated the whole coffin angle. And why the hell was she worrying about bullshit like this right now?</p><p>Kathryn finally made it out of the crowded club and stopped for a moment on the sidewalk to enjoy the simple pleasure of breathing fresh air again. It was cold, but the icy air felt terrific on her overheated face. She didn\u2019t linger long, knowing Lucas would probably be right behind her. She didn\u2019t feel up to trading barbs with him anymore, and she started toward the parking lot. She hadn\u2019t been sure when she\u2019d started out tonight if coming to the club was the smart thing to do, but it had turned out well overall. She\u2019d confirmed that Daniel had been here and that Kurt, at least, had expected him back. And while she\u2019d been certain all along that her brother hadn\u2019t gotten lost somewhere in the backcountry, it was good to know that Kurt had looked for him and not found him.</p><p>But where to go next? The strongest lead she had was still Alex Carmichael, despite what Kurt had said about the vampire\u2019s pickup habits. She had no evidence that her brother\u2019s disappearance was linked to some obsessed fan, after all. Perhaps Carmichael had financial problems and hoped to extort money in exchange for Dan\u2019s release. There\u2019d been no ransom demand, but then one wasn\u2019t necessary. The big money was all Dan\u2019s. All Carmichael needed was a computer, and Dan could pay his own ransom. She made a mental note to check her brother\u2019s bank accounts. She\u2019d done a standard run before leaving Quantico, but she should be monitoring daily for any unusual activity. Things like ATM withdrawals or wire transfers.</p><p>So, sticking with Alex Carmichael as her prime suspect for the time being, he definitely wasn\u2019t going to be found in this tiny town, especially not if he was holding her brother somewhere. Tomorrow morning, she was going to pack all of Daniel\u2019s gear and her few things into her rented SUV and drive to Minneapolis. If there was a lead, it was in the city where Carmichael had a business and friends. She felt certain of that. She was also certain that Lucas knew more than he was saying, but she didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask. Until she did, she was wasting her time trying to get anything out of him.</p><p>Kathryn pulled the keys out of her pocket as she came around the corner of the building and into the poorly lit parking lot. She lifted the fob and looked up as she aimed it in the direction of her SUV.</p> <p>Impossible. But there he was, big as life and so gorgeously masculine that even in her anger she had to admit it. Lucas Donlon was leaning against her truck, arms crossed over his chest, legs casually crossed at the ankle, looking as relaxed as if he\u2019d been hanging around all evening, even though she\u2019d just left him behind in the club.</p><p>\u201cWhen have I ever lied to you?\u201d he asked far too reasonably.</p><p>Apparently he\u2019d been paying attention to her parting shot in the club. Kathryn sent him a dismissive glance and beeped her locks open, hoping God would intervene and zap his perfectly sculpted ass where it rested against the driver\u2019s door of her vehicle.</p><p>Lucas laughed. \u201cIf you want to spank me, a cuisle, I\u2019d rather you use your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if,\u201d she muttered, and then frowned. Had he read her mind? She dismissed the notion as soon as she thought it. He\u2019d simply reacted to the slight vibration of the electronic locks opening, and then, being who he was, had come up with the most risqu\u00e9 comeback he could think of.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she demanded. \u201cAnd how the hell did you get out here before me?\u201d She could have bitten her tongue as soon as she asked the question.</p><p>\u201cYou first. When have I ever lied to you?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Kathryn eyed him impatiently. \u201cAlex Carmichael?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Don\u2019t add insult to . . . insult by pretending you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. Carmichael Galleries. You knew I was looking for an older man named Alex, especially someone who was interested in my brother\u2019s work. Put one and one together, Lucas. You\u2019re not a stupid man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Alex\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Alex. Carmichael\u2019s first name, which you conveniently didn\u2019t mention the other night in your office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually that\u2019s not his first name\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBlah, blah, blah. That\u2019s all I\u2019m hearing from you. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s his first name or his tenth. You knew it was significant and didn\u2019t say a word to me about it.\u201d</p><p>Lucas eyed her intently, and Kathryn became aware that they weren\u2019t alone in the parking lot. There were at least two other vampires lurking on the edges, and his lieutenant Nicholas suddenly appeared around the back of the SUV.</p><p>She frowned. Nicholas looked like someone had sliced off half his face, or at least tried to. What the hell?</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d she asked, walking the short distance between them and reaching out to touch his cheek without thinking.</p><p>He flinched back with a quick look in Lucas\u2019s direction.</p><p>Kathryn spun around. \u201cDid you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucas demanded. \u201cHell no!\u201d He straightened abruptly to his full height, taking two hard strides until he was right on top of her, golden eyes glittering with anger as he loomed over her. \u201cLook, Kathryn, there are things going on that you don\u2019t know about. Things that are every bit as important as your missing brother. Nicholas was seriously injured last night. He shouldn\u2019t even be here, but he is because you were too stubborn to wait one fucking day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might not have a fucking day, don\u2019t you get that?\u201d she yelled at him. \u201cDaniel might not have a day. For all I know your crazy friend is\u2014\u201d Her voice broke off. She couldn\u2019t say out loud what she feared might be happening, what she feared had already happened. She shivered, suddenly freezing cold. She hugged herself, even though she knew the sudden cold owed more to her emotional state than the temperature.</p> <p>\u201cKathryn,\u201d Lucas said softly. \u201cAh, don\u2019t. We\u2019ll find your brother.\u201d He pulled her into his arms. He was so warm. She hadn\u2019t expected that, had somehow thought vampires would be cold even if they weren\u2019t really dead. It was tempting to stay there, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d she muttered, shrugging away his arms, even as she instantly regretted the loss.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s lips flattened. \u201cFine. I don\u2019t know it, but I believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it, a cuisle. Let me tell you something about vampires. Especially vampires who frequent blood houses. When they find someone they like, someone who catches their fancy for whatever reason, they take them home for a while. Don\u2019t you know anyone, a friend, a relative, who\u2019s met someone in a bar and spent a lost weekend with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost weekend?\u201d she repeated.</p> <p>\u201cSex, Kathryn. A weekend in bed, fucking your brains out with someone new, someone you might never see again, or maybe even someone you\u2019ll end up marrying and having a passel of brats with. But the point is, vampires make a habit of it. They find someone . . . well, tasty, and take that person home for a while. It\u2019s completely consensual. Any vampire caught forcing a human these days is dealt with severely by his rightful lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what vampire sexual habits have to do with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Alex Carmichael does have your brother, and I don\u2019t think he does\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, and so does my gut. And I trust my gut a lot more than I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d he said, giving her a wounded look. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll grant that someone has your brother, though it doesn\u2019t have to be Carmichael. But whoever it is,\u201d he continued, overriding her when she started to speak, \u201che\u2019s taken a fancy to your Daniel and taken him home for a spin. Your brother will turn up, a bit exhausted, no doubt. Maybe short a pint, but otherwise fine. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn took a step back, putting more distance between her and Lucas. He was one of those people who touched easily, but his touches were too distracting. She couldn\u2019t afford to let him do that to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Carmichael\u2019s first name, then?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>Lucas gave her an impatient look. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you hunting him down if he was innocent. My people have been hunted and killed by humans as long as we\u2019ve been alive, and for no reason but foolish superstition. If Alex is guilty, I\u2019ll let you talk to him. But not until I know for sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow will you know?\u201d she retorted. \u201cI\u2019m the only one looking for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. I set my own people to tracking him down as soon as you left that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find him?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cNo. Although we know where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d she said leadingly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Chicago, which means I can\u2019t get to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a short flight, Lucas, and you have a plane. So why not?\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s face tightened unhappily. \u201cChicago is out of my jurisdiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who rules it then? I\u2019ll talk to him instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not,\u201d Lucas said sharply, and his eyes were suddenly sparking gold fire as he stared at her.</p><p>Kathryn took another step back, nearly stumbling as the narrow heel of her shoe hit a small rock, and her ankle tried to turn. She caught herself, avoiding Lucas\u2019s helping hand, and glanced down, irritated again that she\u2019d bothered to wear this stupid outfit. Lucas hadn\u2019t dressed up, or maybe he had, given the nature of the club. He was wearing all black, including leather pants, and okay, she needed to look somewhere else, because . . .</p><p>\u201cIs that blood?\u201d she demanded suddenly, her gaze flashing up to meet Lucas\u2019s. \u201cWhat the hell? First you\u2019ve got Nicholas with half his face torn off, then those wild men invade the club all hyped up with what I\u2019m told was some sort of post-conflict bloodlust\u2014which thrilled everyone in there but me, apparently\u2014and now you . . .\u201d She took a longer look. \u201cYour pants and boots are covered in blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belongs to Nicholas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it doesn\u2019t. Not unless the two of you are way more familiar than I think you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Kathryn,\u201d Lucas snapped, his lovely Irish lilt becoming more pronounced as he grew more irritated with her.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what\u2019s going on, or I\u2019m calling the authorities,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThey may not give a damn about my missing brother, but they\u2019re sure as hell going to care about what\u2019s happening in that club.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glowered down at her, his jaw flexing visibly. Suddenly he smiled, and Kathryn wanted to back up even farther.</p><p>\u201cVery well, Kathryn,\u201d he drawled. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you want to know. But not here in the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy motel room, then,\u201d she said, wishing she could yank back the words as soon as she said them. Her motel room? First, it was a dump. But second, she was inviting Lucas back to her motel room? Lucas of the sexy smile and tight leather pants? Was she out of her ever loving mind?</p><p>\u201cTempting, but I think not,\u201d he said, and she breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cIs there a quieter bar somewhere\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>He laughed easily. \u201cIt\u2019s late, and this is a small town, a cuisle. But I\u2019ve a place in mind. We\u2019ll take my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can drive\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe roads are dark, and you don\u2019t know the way. My driver will take us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo want answers or not?\u201d he demanded with sharp impatience.</p><p>Kathryn sighed unhappily. \u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut how will I get back from wherever you\u2019re taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried I\u2019m going to kidnap you?\u201d he scoffed lightly. \u201cVery well, I\u2019ll send someone to bring your truck by later, so you can make your escape . . . should you desire.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn eyed him distrustfully, but nodded. She didn\u2019t know if it was important to her own investigation or not, but she wanted to know whose blood Lucas was wearing and what had happened to Nicholas\u2019s face. That sure as hell hadn\u2019t happened in a bar fight. She was also really curious about what secret dealings were going on with vampires in general. How many humans had been given a chance to peek behind that curtain? It was her curiosity that decided it. She\u2019d go with him tonight and hear what he had to say. But tomorrow morning she was leaving for Minneapolis to continue her own investigation.</p><p>Lucas rested a loose hand against Kathryn\u2019s lower back, escorting her over to the big Suburban, which was standard transport for dignitaries and vampire lords these days. It was black, naturally, and the windows were so darkly tinted they blended seamlessly with the metal all around them. Even the trim was a matte black, and since his vampires didn\u2019t need headlights to see, there was nothing to give them away when they traveled through the night.</p><p>Nicholas opened the back door, and Lucas offered Kathryn a hand up, which she refused, of course. He smiled slightly as she grasped the grip bar instead, forced to turn slightly sidewise in order to take the step up in her black cocktail dress. And what an enticing cocktail dress it was, too. He would love to see her in that dress without those ugly leggings. He was only sorry the night had turned out as it had. But there was hope yet.</p><p>He followed Kathryn into the SUV, sliding over next to her on the bench seat. She stiffened slightly, then relaxed, as if her initial reaction had been automatic rather than intentional.</p><p>Nicholas climbed into the front seat next to Mason and waited for Lucas to tell them where they were going.</p><p>Lucas considered going back to the main house. It was comfortable and safe, and Kathryn knew it already, so she wouldn\u2019t be suspicious. But there were too many people there. Too many phones, too many decisions needing his attention.</p><p>\u201cThe homestead,\u201d Lucas said and felt Nicholas\u2019s surprise ripple down their link. He didn\u2019t comment, however. Neither did Mason. But then Mason wouldn\u2019t. Only Nick was high enough in their hierarchy to occasionally question something Lucas did.</p><p>They cleared the town limits, and Mason switched off the headlights. As the town faded farther and farther behind them, the night grew darker. Mason turned away from the main highway, and Lucas was aware of Kathryn staring out the window intently, probably trying to keep track of where they were going. She was a control freak, but in this case, it was pointless. Even in daytime, there were few recognizable landmarks out here. And by the time they reached their destination, she would be totally lost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stretched an arm along the back of the seat, barely brushing against her long, blond hair. He wanted to bury his face in it and draw in her scent. He loved the smell of a woman\u2019s hair, clean and warm and fragrant with whatever shampoo or perfume she used. It was one of his favorite parts of seducing a woman. And Magda had been right. He very much wanted to seduce Kathryn Hunter, though he wasn\u2019t exactly sure why. The FBI agent wasn\u2019t his usual type. Of course, some people would say he didn\u2019t have a usual type, that his type was pretty much anyone female.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t true. Yes, he loved women, but he didn\u2019t want to seduce every woman he met. He liked making them smile and laugh, liked bringing pleasure to a harassed woman\u2019s night, if only for a few minutes. But that wasn\u2019t seduction.</p><p>Seduction was the slow, exquisite game of persuading a beautiful woman to come into his arms. To dance with him, to share long and languorous kisses in front of a fire. He loved to stroke a woman\u2019s body until she was trembling with desire, until she opened herself willingly, inviting him between her legs and into her body.</p> <p>That\u2019s what he wanted with Kathryn. But why? As Nick had said from the first, she was worse than a local cop, she was FBI, and that spelled trouble. Vampires had too many secrets to be consorting with federal agents of any kind. Sure, there were vampires toiling in the depths of Quantico, along with just about every other federal agency, but that was different. Those vampires had a clear allegiance to a master, who for most of them was Duncan as Vampire Lord over the Capital territory.</p><p>But Kathryn owed no allegiance to anyone but her government. For Lucas to seduce her, to let her see even the tiniest fraction of what made vampire society tick, to risk having that information carried back to her bosses in Quantico? Why would he desire such a thing?</p><p>Lucas crooked a finger and captured a lock of Kathryn\u2019s hair. The answer was simple. Because he wanted her. Because she was tall and blond, with long legs and a terrific ass. Because she was smart and disciplined and always in control. A pain in the ass who would fight him tooth and nail for every inch of progress he made in this seduction, and he loved a challenge.</p><p>But also, because she\u2019d come all this way and had risked the displeasure of her superiors to track down her brother. Because family was important to her, and her brother was the only family she had left. Because family was important to Lucas, too. And he had none.</p><p>Because she had a heart deeply buried beneath all that discipline, and before the night was over, he intended to steal it.</p> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Kathryn tried to keep track of the turns they made, of how far they traveled. But even with a waning moon that was still mostly full, there was nothing to see beyond the dark windows of the big SUV. Maybe if she\u2019d been from around here, if she\u2019d hiked or camped in these hills, she\u2019d have been able to conjure a map in her head of their location, but for a city girl from Virginia, the landscape was a monotonous blur of nothing in the middle of nowhere. Some part of her brain was clanging with alarm, telling her she should be worried about being way out here, all alone, with a bunch of vampires. But no matter which way she looked at it, she just didn\u2019t believe that Lucas would hurt her. Yeah, he\u2019d been less than honest, and he was definitely dangerous, but the kind of danger he represented to her had nothing to do with houses in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>She shifted a bit, exquisitely aware of Lucas\u2019s arm on the seat behind her. It made her feel awkward and insecure, like being back in high school and not knowing if the boy was just stretching his arm or if he really liked her. Kathryn wasn\u2019t that too-tall, gawky girl any longer, but she wasn\u2019t exactly a femme fatale, either. She knew men noticed her. After all, she was a nearly six foot tall blonde, in excellent condition, with a reasonably pretty face. But it usually ended with the noticing. She was a little too self-assured, her college friends had told her, a little too cool. She frightened men off. As if she\u2019d want a relationship with a man who was intimidated by any woman with a backbone.</p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t intimidated by her. He wasn\u2019t intimidated by much of anything as far as she could tell.</p><p>Not that it mattered how Lucas felt about her. She wasn\u2019t here to be seduced by anyone, much less someone who\u2019d intentionally withheld critical information. That was the same as lying in her book. Even if the liar did come wrapped in a very sexy package. She sighed quietly and focused very hard on the meaningless shapes blurring past outside the car, trying to ignore the slight tug on her hair that told her Lucas was playing with it. Damn vampire.</p><p>They turned down a dirt road. It was much rougher and looser beneath the tires, and there were obvious dust clouds billowing past the windows. The big vehicle didn\u2019t slow down at all, though, despite the occasional hard bump and the sound of rocks pinging against the undercarriage. Kathryn leaned toward the center of the SUV, trying to see out the tinted windshield. She thought there was a house up ahead, but couldn\u2019t be certain.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d Lucas said, his deep voice melodic and smooth. Kathryn felt a tremor of desire skim along her nerves and moved back to her side of the seat. She couldn\u2019t see anything anyway, and getting too close to Lucas undermined her determination to hate him.</p><p>Although, that wasn\u2019t really true. She didn\u2019t want to hate him. Quite the opposite. But she didn\u2019t trust him. He lied as easily as he smiled. How could she have any kind of relationship with a man like that? Vampire, she reminded herself once more. He wasn\u2019t a man at all.</p><p>The SUV came to a sudden stop, skidding a little bit on the dirt road. The driver shifted into parking gear and turned off the ignition. Kathryn quickly unbuckled her seatbelt, eager to be away from the enforced intimacy of the darkened back seat. She didn\u2019t wait for Lucas, but popped open the door on her side and stepped out, coughing a little at the accumulated dust lingering in the air.</p><p>She looked around and saw they\u2019d arrived at a house . . . of sorts. She couldn\u2019t see much, but even the moonlight was enough for her to see that the structure was ancient by American standards. Not historic like the castles of Europe, as one of her favorite comedians would have said, but definitely built more than fifty years ago. Way more than fifty years, in this case. Either that or whoever had built it had a really lousy set of construction skills.</p><p>It appeared to be made of wood plank. It was small\u2014she would guess no more than 1200 square feet at best\u2014with a covered porch that was sagging both underfoot and overhead. The wood appeared dry and gray by moonlight, and she could only imagine it would be worse in the bright light of day.</p><p>Kathryn studied it doubtfully. This was where Lucas planned on having their private conversation? Did it even have plumbing? And what about heat? She hoped it didn\u2019t use one of those wood-burning stoves, because those things smoked, and the smell was impossible to get out of her hair and clothes.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like much from out here,\u201d Lucas murmured against her ear.</p><p>Kathryn managed to stifle most of her jump of surprise, but not all of it. She turned a glare on him, but he only winked playfully. Next time he snuck up on her like that, she was going to shoot him. Let him see how funny he found it then. Sneaky bastard.</p> <p>Nicholas came around the side of the house. He\u2019d apparently gone around back for something while she\u2019d been, um, admiring the architecture. He hurried over to where she stood with Lucas and handed her the keys to her rental. She gave him a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s parked on the side of the house,\u201d he told her with a quick wink. \u201cThe driver took a different route out of the city and beat us here.\u201d He turned to Lucas. \u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay here,\u201d Lucas responded to the unvoiced question. \u201cYou guys know the drill. Kathryn and I will be fine in the main house. Make the usual arrangements for morning.\u201d</p><p>Main house? Kathryn thought to herself. There was something smaller than this? She turned her head, searching the surrounding area, but couldn\u2019t see anything that resembled a living structure. Wait. Morning?</p><p>\u201cYes, Sire,\u201d Nicholas was saying. \u201cShould one of us perhaps remain with you, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Nick. Kathryn won\u2019t shoot me, will you, a cuisle?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn gave him a dirty look. Clearly she was going to need an Irish translator app for her phone. He\u2019d used that particular word several times, and she could tell from the context that it was probably some sort of endearment, like sweetheart or honey. It had better be something like that. If it was babe or baby or, God forbid, anything like little one, she was going to set him straight. Just as soon as she figured out what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cKathryn?\u201d</p><p>She smiled to herself. He sounded worried that she hadn\u2019t responded right away to his question about shooting him. \u201cNo,\u201d she said finally, letting regret flavor her reply, \u201cI don\u2019t plan to shoot you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a narrow look at her regretful tone, but told Nicholas, \u201cSettle in for the night, Nick. You\u2019ll know if I need you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas was plainly unhappy about the arrangement, and Kathryn wondered if he actually thought she was a danger to Lucas. But he followed orders, giving his boss a nod and disappearing around the back of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they going?\u201d she asked Lucas, as he started for the porch.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bunk house out back. They\u2019ll be quite comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn doubted that. Just as much as she doubted she was going to be too comfortable in the main house, but what the hell. She\u2019d come this far, and she wasn\u2019t staying long anyway. She followed Lucas, stepping gingerly onto the sagging porch, imagining the narrow tip of her high heel going right through the boards if she wasn\u2019t careful. But it was surprisingly firm, not even sagging under Lucas\u2019s much greater weight as he strode to the front door and inserted a key. The door lock was very sturdy for such an old structure, and a closer look revealed that the doorframe had not only been reinforced, but the door was also more than it appeared. She was no locksmith, but . . . she tapped her knuckles on the door\u2019s surface. It was steel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas glanced at her. \u201cLooks can be deceiving, Kathryn.\u201d He pushed on into the house with Kathryn on his heels. She was curious now. How much of what she\u2019d seen was just for show?</p><p>Lucas whispered a few words, and Kathryn felt the brush of something along her skin, like static electricity. All at once the room lit with warm light. Candles flamed up on the mantle, but most of the light came from several shaded lamps throughout the room, which was definitely not what she\u2019d expected.</p><p>And then it hit her. She\u2019d just witnessed . . . magic? Impossible, but what other word was there to describe it? Lucas had whispered, and suddenly there was light. If it had been only the lamps, she would have assumed some vampire version of clap-on/clap-off, but candles? She strode over to the fireplace and took a good look at the fat columns of lightly scented wax. The flames appeared real, but . . . she licked her fingers and pinched the wick on one of them as a test. It sizzled out between her fingers, and Lucas laughed behind her.</p> <p>\u201cThe candles are quite real, as is the flame. I abhor those fake, electric ones. There\u2019s no romance.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn spun to face him with a narrow look. \u201cWho said anything about romance? We\u2019re here to talk.\u201d</p><p>Lucas tossed his jacket aside and shook his head in mock dismay. \u201cSuch a practical woman you are, Kathryn Hunter. It pains my heart. There is romance everywhere. Or there should be. The world would be a better place for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d she said skeptically and studied the old house with new eyes. Someone had gone to a lot of trouble to give the appearance of disrepair on the outside. But in here, there was no pretense. Whoever had decorated the main house at the ranch had worked on this one, too. The living room was small\u2014there was no faking that\u2014but it was filled with comfortable-looking furniture. A huge overstuffed couch of reddish brown leather, with two chairs that matched it in both size and color, occupied the space in front of the fireplace\u2014which flared suddenly to life.</p><p>Kathryn gave Lucas a sharp look, and he grinned back at her, doing an elegant little gesture with his hand like some sort of stage magician. The only thing missing was a triumphant \u201cta-da!\u201d And wouldn\u2019t she like to know exactly how he did that? Nothing she\u2019d read indicated that vampires had real magic, beyond their extended lifespans, that is.</p> <p>She turned her back on his far-too-pleased-with-himself expression and continued her perusal of the room. A rectangle of dark wood, pitted and scarred beneath a thick resin finish, sat atop a chunk of natural rock and served as a coffee table. Most of the floor was hardwood, but a large area rug of a deep, rich red sat beneath the table. Looking all the way to the right, Kathryn saw a kitchenette that was little more than a sink and a microwave with a small set of cabinets and a bar refrigerator underneath. A small kitchen table of pale pine stood next to the window with four chairs, one on each side. Vampires didn\u2019t require much in the way of kitchens, she supposed. The table was probably more for extra seating than potential dinner guests.</p><p>She glanced up and found Lucas watching her size up the place. \u201cThis is very nice,\u201d she commented, running an appreciative hand over the soft leather back of the couch.</p><p>\u201cNot what you expected, though,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She smiled in spite of herself. \u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut you\u2019re a sneaky guy.\u201d</p><p>Lucas clutched his chest. \u201cAnd once again, you wound me.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn rolled her eyes and walked to the other side of the room. There were two open doors; one led to the bedroom. She did no more than glance at that one before quickly moving on to the other, which was a guest bathroom, with only a sink and toilet. She wondered if there was a master bath off the bedroom, but had no intention of finding out. This was clearly Lucas\u2019s hideaway place, which meant that was his bedroom. Not going in there. No way. Nuh uh.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d Lucas asked, strolling over to the bar like a big, lazy cat. Did the man never simply walk?</p><p>\u201cWater, if you have it,\u201d she replied politely. \u201cI have to drive back to the motel later.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave her an unreadable look, but pulled a bottle of water from the fridge and handed it to her after twisting the cap off with an audible crack of the plastic seal. She thought it likely that he did that on purpose, to demonstrate that there was nothing in there but water.</p><p>For himself, he took a crystal tumbler from the cabinet and poured an amber-colored liquor from the matching decanter on the counter. The smooth scent of fine whiskey filled Kathryn\u2019s nose. She wasn\u2019t a whiskey drinker, but her father had been, and the scent brought back memories of her childhood. She couldn\u2019t say they\u2019d been better times, but maybe they\u2019d been less complicated.</p><p>Lucas took his whiskey neat. He indicated the furniture in front of the fireplace, and Kathryn moved around the big couch. She was tempted to sit on one of the chairs instead, but that would have been too cowardly. So she sat on the couch, far enough from the middle that it didn\u2019t invite any intimacy. Something poked her side as she settled into the cushions, reminding her she was still wearing her Glock. She unclipped the holster from her belt and laid it on the coffee table.</p><p>One side of Lucas\u2019s mouth lifted in a smile as he circled the table, then fell gracefully onto the couch and put his back in the corner opposite hers, one knee cocked up on the cushions.</p><p>Kathryn took a small sip of the cold water. \u201cSo how do you do it? How do you light candles and fireplaces and turn on lights without touching anything?\u201d She flipped her hand in the general direction of the fireplace.</p><p>He shrugged dismissively. \u201cI am Vampire. Has no one told you what that means? I would have thought the FBI would know that much at least.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe they do, but I don\u2019t. You said you\u2019d answer my questions if I came with you. So, enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas regarded her with a thoughtful expression, then asked, \u201cWhat do you know about vampires? Or rather, think you do.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn blinked, somewhat surprised that he\u2019d given in so easily. She didn\u2019t trust \u201ceasy,\u201d especially not when it came to Lucas Donlon. But she wanted answers, so she\u2019d play along for now.</p><p>\u201cNot much more than what\u2019s commonly known,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd I assume a good percentage of that is fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of it, I\u2019d wager,\u201d he agreed, and took a slow sip from his glass. He eyed her for a long moment. \u201cDo you believe in magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said instantly. \u201cBut I believe something can look like magic, if one doesn\u2019t understand how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr if one cannot do it, while another can,\u201d Lucas agreed.</p><p>\u201cExactly. So how do you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot explain it,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cIt would be like Einstein trying to explain how he was able to see the universe the way he did, or a football quarterback trying to explain how he\u2019s able to hit the precise spot his receiver will be seconds before the man gets there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEinstein?\u201d she repeated archly.</p><p>Lucas laughed easily. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t like that one. That\u2019s why I threw in the quarterback. No pun intended.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn groaned, but she couldn\u2019t help smiling at the same time. He was so damn charming, even when he was being arrogant. Quarterback indeed. She was pretty sure he thought he was Einstein, not some football hero.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Einstein,\u201d she drawled. \u201cBut please try to explain to this mere mortal what you feel when you do it. Do you just think it, and it\u2019s true? Can every vampire do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, to both questions. Every vampire is changed in some way by the transformation from human to vampire. But very few have the extraordinary levels of power necessary to become a vampire lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, of course, are one of the few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not vanity, Kathryn, but fact. And did you not just tell me that one cannot argue with the facts? I will admit, however, that I cannot take any credit for my abilities. It is a twist of fate, and no one, not even the most powerful among us can predict who will be a vampire lord and who will not. On the other hand,\u201d he continued deliberately, \u201cI can and do take credit for what I have done with those abilities. Even Einstein had to discipline his genius.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn couldn\u2019t argue with that. \u201cBut what about the fire and the lights? Is that unique to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to claim it, but, no. If a vampire is powerful enough, he\u2014or she, though most vampires are male for reasons I\u2019ll not get into at this moment\u2014can manipulate energy. That is probably not a scientifically accurate description, but that\u2019s what it feels like when I do it. Even for vampires, however, the laws of physics still hold. I cannot create energy. I can only effect change on what is already there. I simply do with raw energy what you would do with a match. The effect is still the same. I\u2019m just skipping a step or two.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him silently, careful to keep her thoughts from her face. She\u2019d bet she wasn\u2019t the first person to underestimate Lucas Donlon. To assume he was nothing more than a handsome charmer with no meaningful thoughts in his head. The laws of physics! Not her best subject. Not her subject at all, come to think of it. She\u2019d avoided the science and math listings in her college catalog with a diligence that bordered on some sort of phobia.</p><p>\u201cAs I said earlier, Kathryn,\u201d Lucas commented quietly, \u201cthings are not always what they seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I am,\u201d he replied predictably. \u201cBut enough about the secrets of Vampire. Tell me, why do you think Alex Carmichael is involved in the disappearance of your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I do. Right now, he\u2019s only someone I want to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did Kurt tell you when you talked to him at the club tonight?\u201d</p><p>Her first thought was to wonder how Lucas knew she\u2019d talked to Kurt at all, but then she frowned as she considered the phrasing of Lucas\u2019s question. He clearly already knew at least some of what Kurt had told her, and in the next moment, she realized that Kurt had only spoken to her at all because Lucas had okayed it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou knew about Kurt and Daniel,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot when you came to me. But I told you I started my own investigation that night. I would have told you all of this if you\u2019d given me time, however, events intervened. My presence was demanded elsewhere, and you went to the club without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blood on your pants.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne thing at a time. How much did Kurt tell you?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. On the one hand, it seemed as if he\u2019d been keeping information from her yet again. On the other, it was entirely possible he was telling the truth. That he would have told her what he\u2019d found out if whatever the emergency was that had pulled him away hadn\u2019t happened, and if she\u2019d waited the extra day and gone to the club with him.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cKurt told me he\u2019s worried. That Daniel came into the club two nights in a row to see him, and when he didn\u2019t show up the third night, Kurt went looking for him and couldn\u2019t find him. He stressed to me that he really looked, which, given your demonstration with the candles, I now take to mean that you all have ways of looking that are not available to the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded absently. \u201cSome, though it depends\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the vampire,\u201d she finished for him. \u201cYeah, I got that. But what about Kurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKurt is my best tracker. He not only knows your brother, he knows that part of the Badlands. If he says Daniel isn\u2019t there, he\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich brings us back to Alex Carmichael,\u201d Kathryn insisted.</p><p>\u201cIt could be someone trying to set him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that. I know my job, Lucas. But at a minimum, I need to talk to him. His assistant confirms that Daniel is a favorite of his in the gallery, and yet he recently removed a major exhibit of my brother\u2019s work. I\u2019m not talking about anything you bought from him. This take-down was so recent that it was still in progress when I was there today, which\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went to Chicago?\u201d Lucas demanded with far greater urgency than she would have thought necessary.</p><p>Kathryn frowned. \u201cNo, Minneapolis, why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Lucas said, shaking his head. \u201cWhat else did you find there?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t nothing, Kathryn thought to herself. It probably had something to do with the so-called events which had kept Lucas from making their club date tonight. The same events that had torn Nicholas\u2019s face up and left Lucas covered in blood. She\u2019d get it out of him eventually, but she wanted to know more about Carmichael, so she answered Lucas\u2019s question first.</p><p>\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t find,\u201d she continued, \u201cwas Carmichael. He was not only out of town, but supposedly unreachable. And in a time when even children have cell phones, that makes me think he\u2019s avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, he\u2019s in Chicago. But that doesn\u2019t mean anything. He\u2019s based there. He has his main gallery there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why won\u2019t he call me? I\u2019m sure his assistant had him on the phone two minutes after I walked out the door, letting him know I\u2019m on his trail. And speaking of trails, the local one here has gone cold. I think it probably went cold within hours of Daniel\u2019s disappearance, that whoever has him took him away from here long ago. Kurt\u2019s information only confirms it. Which is why I\u2019m going back to Minneapolis tomorrow, and from there I\u2019ll go to Chicago, if I have to. There has to be a reason why Alex Carmichael is so determined to avoid me, but he can\u2019t hide forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn shrugged. \u201cUnless I find a reason to stay. I\u2019ve already packed most of my brother\u2019s gear. It\u2019s too valuable to leave in that motel room, so I\u2019ll take it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can leave it at the ranch. It will be perfectly safe.\u201d</p> <p>Kathryn studied him. Daniel\u2019s gear would certainly be safer at Lucas\u2019s ranch than in her SUV, but then she\u2019d have to come back here to retrieve it, especially if, when she found him, Daniel wasn\u2019t up to coming back for it himself.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll ship it home,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>Lucas studied her in turn. \u201cYou still think I lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did lie to me. A lie of omission to be sure, but still a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if Carmichael was involved. I still don\u2019t. And I\u2019m not willing to sic the FBI on him without evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the FBI, not in this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t split hairs, Kathryn. You know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I only want to ask him a few questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all any of you want, and pretty soon you\u2019re compiling databases of who we are and what we can do, and the next thing we know the peasants are after us with pitchforks and torches.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn scowled. \u201cPitchforks and torches, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA movie caricature, to be sure, but the sentiment is valid. We\u2019ve been hunted before, and we\u2019ve no intention of being hunted again. We\u2019re stronger now, smarter. We\u2019ve learned to hide in plain sight, and to use your laws and culture against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you lied about Alex because you were protecting him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only him, specifically, but, yes. I told you, I have my people checking him out. If I find anything, I\u2019ll tell you. If not, there\u2019s no harm to Alex or to you. This is my town, my territory. If a vampire is committing crimes here, it\u2019s my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d she reminded him pointedly.</p><p>Lucas shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex is Vampire. By our laws, he is responsible to his master and no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis master? Talk about caricatures. Do you make him eat flies if he disappoints you?\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave a bark of laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one. But I\u2019m not Alex\u2019s master. His master is in Chicago, as a matter of fact, which is why you don\u2019t want to go poking around there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I came poking around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly enough for my taste,\u201d Lucas murmured. \u201cBut then, I\u2019m a much nicer guy than the vampire who rules Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking to make friends, Lucas. You all may think you\u2019re not subject to our laws\u2014which are yours, too, since you live here\u2014but believe me, you are. What\u2019s this vampire\u2019s name, in case I need to question him?\u201d</p><p>Lucas stood abruptly. \u201cDrop it, Kathryn.\u201d</p><p>She watched in surprise as he moved restlessly around the room, finally stopping near the small kitchen. A sofa table matching the distressed wood of the coffee table was pushed up against the wall there, with a big book standing open on one of those old-fashioned book stands, the kind people, or museums, used to put a particular book on display, like a work of art or something. On the wall above the table was a collection of framed prints and photographs, most of which looked fairly old.</p><p>Kathryn set her water bottle down and walked over to see what he was looking at. Her eyebrows shot up when she got a closer look at the book. It was a Bible, its pages old and fragile looking, but with the elaborate margin and text embellishments typical of that type of book. The reds and blues were somewhat faded, but the gold appeared to be gilt rather than ink, and it still gleamed.</p><p>Kathryn wasn\u2019t religious, and so she didn\u2019t know if publishers still put out these types of Bibles, or if everything had gone digital by now. But she\u2019d had a friend in childhood whose mother had a Bible like this. The mom had made them wash their hands before touching the delicate pages, but had always been willing to show it to them. She\u2019d especially enjoyed pointing out the front pages, which had listed her family\u2019s ancestors going back several generations.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s book was open to just such a page, but this book was far older than her friend\u2019s mom\u2019s had been. This Bible had a genealogical listing that started in the 16th century, and that was just the page Kathryn could see. It was obvious that the previous pages went back even further. She looked closer and saw that, although there were several surnames mixed in through the various marriages, only one surname was present throughout, and that was Donlon. This was Lucas\u2019s family bible. And wasn\u2019t that interesting?</p><p>She peered closer and saw that the family tree stopped altogether in the late 18th century. The last marriage was Lord Donal Donlon and Moira Keane, which joining produced only a single child, a daughter named Brighid. But after that, nothing. Kathryn scanned the previous generations, but didn\u2019t see Lucas\u2019s name listed anywhere. She was dying to turn the page back and find out exactly when he\u2019d been born, but didn\u2019t quite have the courage to touch the antique Bible with her unwashed fingers\u2014a lesson lingering inconveniently from her friend\u2019s mom.</p><p>Stymied by good manners, if nothing else, Kathryn straightened and checked out the framed pictures on the wall instead, half-expecting to find more of her brother\u2019s work. But most of these were far too old to be Dan\u2019s. Several were of the same thing, a gray stone castle, with twin towers and crenelated battlements. She looked more closely. There were two images of the castle at the very top which weren\u2019t photographs. One appeared to be an ink sketch, while the other was a watercolor. Lower down there were four separate photographs of the same thing, ranging from sepia to black and white, and then what she assumed to be the most recent one, which was in full color. In it, the sun was shining in a cloud-dotted blue sky, highlighting the emerald green lawn which rolled down the hill in front of the castle.</p><p>\u201cCastle Donlon,\u201d Lucas said right next to her.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s heart caught. She\u2019d been so engrossed in the images, she\u2019d almost forgotten he was standing there. She glanced over and saw him watching her.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said, feeling embarrassment heat her face.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. They\u2019re on the wall to be seen.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. But Kathryn had a feeling not too many people saw them. This place had the feel of a retreat, not a meeting house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Bible,\u201d she said hesitantly, then forged ahead. \u201cIs that your family\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Lucas eyed her silently for so long that she thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer. She was ready to apologize and withdraw back to her corner of the couch when he said abruptly, \u201cIt is. The Bible and the castle, both.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn swallowed, not daring to ask, but oh she really wanted to know where Lucas fit in.</p> <p>His mouth curved in a lopsided smile. \u201cThe castle is mine now. I bought it . . . a long time ago and had it refurbished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you live there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I live here,\u201d he said distinctly, as if explaining the obvious.</p><p>\u201cYes, but, do you, I don\u2019t know, vacation there or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVacation,\u201d he repeated, then seemed to think about it. \u201cNo. I visit once a year, if I\u2019m lucky, and only for a few days. Sometimes less, depending.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn what? If I owned something like that, I\u2019d visit all the time,\u201d Kathryn said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cWould you? Those old castles can be drafty, not to mention the bad plumbing.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn tilted her head thoughtfully. \u201cNo. You said you refurbished. I bet it\u2019s been completely modernized. It might look like a castle from the outside, but I bet the inside looks more like this.\u201d She waved to indicate the tastefully decorated room around them. \u201cYou enjoy your comforts, Lord Donlon.\u201d</p><p>Lucas dipped his head noncommittally, but Kathryn knew she was right. Feeling bold, she decided to take advantage of his seeming willingness to talk.</p><p>\u201cSo who owned the castle before you?\u201d she asked, thinking it must have been some distant uncle or cousin, because Lucas had already told her about growing up poor. Whoever owned that castle wasn\u2019t poor.</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather owned it.\u201d</p> <p>Kathryn frowned. \u201cYour grandfather,\u201d she repeated, then gave him a dirty look. \u201cI thought your grandfather was a poor dirt farmer with a broken-down plow horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have understated his position somewhat,\u201d he said, flashing a playful grin that didn\u2019t quite make it to his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSomewhat? That\u2019s a fucking castle! Did you grow up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said curtly. The playfulness fled his expression, and she knew she\u2019d touched on a sensitive subject. \u201cI told you the truth of that,\u201d he continued. \u201cI visited the old man once, although visit might be an exaggeration. My mother took me there when I was no more than six years old. The two of us were living on the streets, starving and cold most of the time, and that bitter old man turned her away. He wouldn\u2019t even let his own daughter sleep in the barn. We left and never went back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kathryn murmured, hearing the pain in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt happened a very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you come to own it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought it. Land and titles both. I had the greater claim, certainly better than the cousins who ran it into ruin. But they wouldn\u2019t have seen it that way, even if they\u2019d known who I was, what with me being a bastard and all. On the rare occasions I sleep there now, I feel the ghost of my grandfather howling in the eaves because the bastard\u2019s taken over his precious castle. Gives me sweet dreams every time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd your mother?\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded at a small, oval frame to his left, almost eye-level with where Kathryn was standing. \u201cMy mother,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cShe died when I was seven.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn leaned in close. The frame held a delicate watercolor of a young woman with long, curling black hair that tumbled over her shoulders. The pose was meant to be serious, but the artist had captured the slight up tilt of her full, red lips, the laughter in her eyes that were so much like Lucas\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShe was beautiful,\u201d Kathryn said honestly.</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she die?\u201d</p><p>Lucas turned toward her almost angrily. \u201cHow does a young woman die on the streets of Dublin? She was sixteen and pregnant when her father cast her out for the sin of being unwed. Barely twenty-four when she died. Of cold, hunger, disease? Who knows? I was too young to know such details. I only knew she was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kathryn said again. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m prying into this. It\u2019s none of my business.\u201d</p><p>Lucas reached toward her without warning. Kathryn flinched, but all he did was tuck a wayward strand of hair behind her ear from where it had escaped her ponytail.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything you\u2019d like,\u201d he said, arching an elegant eyebrow. He took a sip of his whiskey, maintaining eye contact over the rim of his crystal tumbler.</p><p>Kathryn recognized his attempt to shove back painful memories, to reassert his devil-may-care mask. She remembered what it was like to pretend everything was all right when it never would be again. So, she played along, returning his look with a teasing half-smile. \u201cAll right,\u201d she began, and then almost chickened out, blurting in a rush the one thing she really wanted to know. \u201cWhen did you become a vampire?\u201d</p><p>Lucas raised both eyebrows in surprise. She supposed it was from her temerity in asking such a personal question. \u201cWell, now, Kathryn,\u201d he murmured, moving so close that she could feel the whiskey-scented moisture of his breath along her jaw. \u201cThat is a very personal question. The sort of thing one shares with very good friends . . .\u201d He leaned even closer and put his lips next to her ear. \u201cOr lovers.\u201d He lowered his mouth to kiss the soft skin below her ear, and she shivered.</p><p>\u201cWhich one are you, a cuisle?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s heart was trying to break out of her chest, it was pounding so hard, making it difficult to draw a full breath. She knew she should say something clever and back away, that it was foolish to get personally involved with Lucas Donlon. But there was a part of her that rebelled against always doing the right thing, always being the dutiful daughter, the responsible sister, the perfect Bureau agent. The part that was buried so deep inside her that she forgot it existed most of the time. The part of her that wanted something more. Maybe it was the vulnerability he\u2019d shown with his pictures on the wall, the anger that still hardened his voice when he spoke of his long-dead grandfather. But she suspected it was more than that. Lucas was like a blazing fire. You knew he was dangerous, that nothing good would come of it, but you couldn\u2019t resist the pull, the brilliant heart of a flame you knew would heat you all the way to your marrow, even as it burned you alive.</p><p>And there was only tonight. She was leaving town tomorrow.</p><p>She reached for his whiskey glass. Locking gazes with him, she brought it to her lips and took a long drink, feeling the whiskey heat all the way down her throat to her stomach. \u201cWhich would you like me to be?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cFriend or lover?\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes flared a gold that put the fire\u2019s heart to shame. He reached for her, wrapping his arm around her waist and pulling her against the hard length of his body. \u201cBe sure, Kathryn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He took the whiskey glass from her unresisting hand and set it on the table so delicately that it made no sound at all. Kathryn watched the amber glow of the liquid, her stomach in knots even though she knew this was what she wanted, what she\u2019d wanted from the moment she\u2019d walked into his office and seen him for the first time. But now that it was here, now that the fantasy had become reality . . .</p><p>Lucas gripped her chin with gentle fingers and lifted her face to his. His mouth curved in a warm smile, but his eyes . . . they burned with desire. For her. The knowledge that he wanted her as much as she wanted him calmed her as nothing else could have. She curled her arms around his neck, rising up on to her tiptoes to brush her lips against his. Not a kiss, not yet. Just a feathering of her lips, back and forth, as his eyes grew hotter, his gaze more intense.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s arm tightened around her waist, holding her in place so that she couldn\u2019t have moved away if she\u2019d wanted to. His other hand dropped to the curve of her butt, cupping both cheeks in his long fingers and squeezing, pressing her against the hard ridge of his arousal.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s eyes, still captured by his, grew wider, as Lucas thrust his hips forward, making certain she felt every inch of his erection. She did. Oh, God, she did. She fisted one hand in his silky, black hair and licked his closed lips. Once, twice, then bit down gently on his lower lip demandingly.</p><p>Lucas growled. As if a switch had been thrown, heat flared between them like a warning that everything they\u2019d done so far was adolescent flirting. And the adults were now in the room.</p><p>Lucas crushed his mouth against hers, forcing her lips to open. He stabbed his tongue into her mouth, pumping it like a small cock, conquering with sweeps of his tongue, tasting every inch of her mouth with such shocking speed that Kathryn could only submit. She finally fought back, demanding her share in return, tangling her tongue with his as they battled for dominance.</p><p>This was no romantic first kiss in the moonlight. This was the kiss of two people who\u2019d hungered for each other for days, wanted, waited for this moment. Their kiss was hard and full of passion, a clashing of teeth and tongue, biting and licking, mouths mashed together so that Kathryn could barely breathe.</p><p>She made a small sound of distress, and Lucas threaded his fingers in her ponytail and tugged her head back. \u201cBreathe,\u201d he commanded, his own breath sawing in and out.</p><p>Kathryn nodded wordlessly, her eyes never leaving his face.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Lucas swore, then took his arms away long enough to rip his T-shirt over his head, before pulling her against him once more.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s gaze shifted to the very image of male beauty that was his body\u2014wide shoulders thickly padded with muscle, tapering to smoothly defined pectorals lightly dusted with black hair which narrowed to a thin line over six pack abs that made her want to weep with their sheer perfection. Her eye was drawn down further to the low waist of his leather pants and the bulge that was stretching the leather so tight that it was gleaming with the strain of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She heard someone moaning with need and realized the sound was coming from her own throat. Her eyes shot back to Lucas\u2019s face, and then they were kissing again, their mouths crushed together as he tried to get her jacket off and Kathryn tried to help him. With a cry of frustration, she broke their kiss and shrugged the jacket down her arms, letting it drop to the floor.</p><p>Lucas growled, fisting handfuls of her tight dress as he dragged it up over her hips until it was bunched around her waist. He yanked her against him, then swore softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking with these stupid leggings?\u201d he muttered, shoving his hands down inside the waistband and pushing the tight pants down until he was cupping her nearly bare ass.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking I didn\u2019t want to fuck anyone,\u201d she snarled right back at him, unbuckling the wide belt and stripping it from her waist.</p><p>Lucas laughed breathlessly. \u201cGood thinking since you didn\u2019t know I would be there.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s response was lost as Lucas pulled the dress off over her head, then stepped back to eye her half-naked body. Kathryn blushed hotly, even though she knew she was in good shape. But the sweep of his gaze was like a caress, a brush of warm velvet over her skin, from the taut muscles of her stomach, to the swell of her breasts above the cups of her plain, white, cotton bra. And, oh God, why hadn\u2019t she bought a new bra when she bought the dress?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on being ravished,\u201d she pulled back to explain breathlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s my work bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t know I would be there,\u201d he murmured again. \u201cBut since you\u2019re no longer working\u2014\u201d He pulled her close, grinding his erection against her, while he reached around and unhooked the clasp on her bra with a quick twist of his fingers. \u201c\u2014I think you should get rid of it,\u201d he whispered, then laid a sweet trail of gentle kisses down her neck and over the delicate bone of her clavicle.</p> <p>Kathryn felt the bra give way, felt the delicious release of her heavy breasts from the tight binding of the sturdy bra. She let go of Lucas long enough to slide the straps down her arms. Ever the neat one, she tried to catch it with one hand rather than let it fall to the floor, but Lucas grabbed it and tossed it away, his gaze burning as he eyed her naked breasts for the first time. They seemed to swell under the force of his blatant desire, her nipples tightening as tiny shocks of lust tingled from her breasts to her abdomen and lower, where her pussy was clenching eagerly, demanding that Kathryn give it what it wanted. And it wanted Lucas.</p><p>Lucas cupped her breasts reverently in his long fingers, his thumb playing with her sensitive nipples, strumming back and forth until Kathryn thought she\u2019d climax before they ever made it to bed.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Lucas whispered, bending enough to take one nipple into his mouth and sucking hard.</p><p>Kathryn moaned. She didn\u2019t want to be admired. She wanted to be fucked. She fisted both hands in his hair and tugged him away from her breasts and back to her mouth. She pressed herself against him, rubbing her breasts against the wonderful hard planes of his chest, feeling the rasp of his chest hair against her nipples.</p><p>Lucas dropped both hands to her ass, swearing when he encountered the stupid leggings once more. \u201cFuck this,\u201d he snarled and dropped to his knees, dragging the offending pants down her legs and over her bare feet . . . which put him exactly at eye level with her sex, which was covered in nothing but a black, silk thong.</p><p>Lucas leaned forward and kissed her through the thin fabric. \u201cIs this your work thong, too?\u201d he teased.</p> <p>Kathryn tangled her fingers in his hair, gasping when he slid a single finger under the triangle of silk and into her already wet pussy. Her hips thrust toward him as if they had a will of their own, and Kathryn threw her head back in sheer wanton pleasure. She felt sexual in a way she never had before. Desired and beautiful, as if there were no more rules. Some part of her brain knew this wasn\u2019t her. There were always rules. But the sight of the beautiful male on his knees before her overwhelmed everything except the hunger to have Lucas Donlon deep between her thighs as quickly and as often as possible.</p><p>She laughed with pure joy at the sensation.</p><p>Lucas surged to his feet, his fingers still buried inside her, pumping in and out, her wetness growing hot and slick, drenching his hand. He lowered his mouth to hers, and they kissed again, hungry, full of desire and need. It was an almost frantic kiss, as if they couldn\u2019t get enough of each other, couldn\u2019t meet fast enough.</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d Lucas gasped against her mouth. He started backing Kathryn toward the bedroom, stopping every other step as their kiss deepened, making them forget everything else. Finally he growled and lifted her against his body until his erection was nestled in the perfect V of her legs. Kathryn responded instinctively, wrapped her legs around his hips for balance and to get closer to the thing she wanted, his cock buried inside her.</p><p>Lucas kept walking, carrying her into the bedroom as if she weighed nothing. Kathryn felt delicate and feminine and oh so sensuous.</p><p>He dropped one knee onto the bed, laying her down and stripping away the triangle of silken thong. It was soaking wet. Kathryn could feel the moisture as he dragged it down her leg, could smell her own arousal. She stretched on the bed, hands above her head, arching her back and lifting her breasts in offering.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes were fixed on her like a giant jungle cat\u2019s, not moving at all, a predator sizing up his prey. Kathryn\u2019s heart began to pound as some primitive part of her brain registered the danger and went into fight or flight mode. She pressed a hand against her chest, telling her stupid heart to calm down, because this was what she wanted, and she wasn\u2019t going anywhere. She stroked her hand downward, scraping over a swollen nipple, smoothing over her flat belly and dipping between her legs.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s predator\u2019s gaze watched her hand every inch of the way, flaring with a gold light when she spread her legs and slid her finger between the swollen lips of her pussy.</p> <p>\u201cTake off your pants,\u201d Kathryn ordered. He grinned viciously as his gaze shot up to her face.</p><p>Kathryn didn\u2019t trust that grin, but she watched eagerly as Lucas stood away from the bed and stripped down to reveal nothing but luscious, naked male. He was commando beneath all that leather, and Kathryn wanted to cheer. His cock sprang forward, hard, long and thick. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of it as he stalked toward her. She felt even more like a tasty gazelle frozen under the gaze of a big cat, about to be gobbled up.</p><p>Yum. She could hardly wait.</p><p>Lucas crawled onto the bed, covering her body and pushing her knees up and out, pressing her legs wide with his hips, as he began a teasing sort of thrust with his cock. She could feel the hard length of his shaft sliding in her wetness, pressing her plumped folds open until he was rubbing against the very place she most wanted him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you first, a cuisle,\u201d he said, pressing his erection against her until her pussy began clenching in desperate need.</p><p>She almost shrieked in denial when he sat back suddenly, then groaned as he plunged two fingers into her vagina, pumping in and out while rubbing her clit until she was so wet, she could feel the moisture coating the inside of her thighs. Lucas licked his lips hungrily, his eyes half-lidded until they were twin slices of gold fire watching his fingers slide in and out of her dripping folds, his thumb circling her clit. Kathryn moaned, pinching her nipples and squeezing her thighs around his hips in a desperate bid to relieve the ache.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make love after,\u201d Lucas said in a low voice, as he licked his fingers, then stretched out above her. She was swamped with lust and had to concentrate to understand the words. \u201cBut first . . .\u201d</p><p>He reached down and positioned his cock between her thighs. She could feel the firm tip barely nudging into her eager pussy and immediately lifted her hips, trying to force it deeper. Lucas chuckled, then flexed his perfect ass and slid into her with a slow, irresistible push. His shaft was long and thick, filling her more completely than any lover she\u2019d had before, stretching her inner walls until every nerve was bare, singing with the velvet brush of his cock as he went deeper and deeper, until she felt the slap of his balls against her ass, the tap of his cock against her cervix.</p><p>Kathryn closed her eyes against an overwhelming wave of pleasure, the delicious sensation of his erection filling every inch of her. She gripped his ass and opened her eyes to find him watching her. They held each other\u2019s gaze for a moment, and then they went wild.</p><p>Their mouths met in a clash of teeth and tongues as Lucas began pumping furiously, fucking her fast and hard as Kathryn rose up to meet every stroke. Her breasts were crushed against his chest, her nipples so sensitized that it was almost too much, streaks of desire racing from her breasts, over her belly and down between her legs, where they crashed against the exquisite pulse of her swollen clit, against the slide of Lucas\u2019s thrusting cock, then raced back up again to torment her breasts in a never-ending cycle.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s hands were beneath her hips, lifting her up, opening her even further to his invasion. His cock moved impossibly faster with every stroke, his hips pushing harder, as if he couldn\u2019t fuck fast enough, hard enough, deep enough.</p><p>He tore his mouth away from hers and buried his face against her neck. His teeth closed gently over the taut tendon there, and Kathryn bit into his shoulder to swallow her scream. Lucas growled against her flushed skin, then stroked his tongue over the skin of her neck, a slow, deliberate gliding of wet heat.</p><p>\u201cTell me it\u2019s okay, Kathryn,\u201d he panted, his hips never stopping their motion. \u201cJesus, tell me I can taste you.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s heart kicked in doubt, in fear. She could barely think, too overcome with desires she\u2019d never felt before, with a raw lust she\u2019d never known she was capable of. Her brain wanted to think about it, but the rest of her body knew what it ached for, what it wanted now. She hesitated for a breath, and then in a flash of insight, she decided. She\u2019d known whom she was going to bed with, known what he was. And she wanted him. All of him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas lifted his head and howled, then lowered his mouth once more. He sucked hard on the swell of her jugular vein below her ear, and she felt the rigid edge of his fangs. Her breath froze in her lungs, and then he was biting her, his fangs puncturing her vein with a sharp pinch, and then . . . she screamed as the most intense orgasm she\u2019d ever experienced swept over her without warning. It was like a seizure, her back arching, her skin shivering with need as her womb convulsed, and her pussy clenched like a tight fist around Lucas\u2019s cock.</p><p>Lucas groaned as her inner walls squeezed his shaft, the sound a deep vibration against her throat that sent fresh waves of sensation trembling along every nerve. He lifted his head, his fangs sliding out of her vein smoothly, like a cool kiss against her hot skin. She felt the quick rasp of his tongue, and then he was fucking her again, pulling his cock out of the embrace of her clutching vagina and slamming it back in, in and out, the friction of his motion heating her inside and out, his hips slamming into hers.</p><p>Kathryn dug her blunt nails into his firm ass, spreading her legs wide and thrusting upward, meeting his every stroke until he snarled at her. And then he was coming, his cock bucking inside her, his climax a hot splash against her womb as he lifted his head and shouted her name.</p><p>Lucas collapsed on top of Kathryn, his face buried against her neck where he could still smell the delicious scent of her blood. He was waiting for her to explode, to be furious that he\u2019d taken her vein while she was in the throes of her climax. But even if she did, it was worth it. He\u2019d had hundreds, thousands of lovers over his long life, but he couldn\u2019t recall a single one who could match the heat, the urgency of what he and Kathryn had just shared. Even so, he hadn\u2019t intended to take her blood like that. He\u2019d thought they would have a fast round of fucking to get the initial hunger out of the way, and then have a slow, romantic bout of lovemaking, during which he would seduce her into accepting the true experience of a vampire lover. Instead, he\u2019d been so desperate in the frantic passion of their coupling that he\u2019d all but begged. He\u2019d seen the indecision in her expression and known how close she\u2019d come to saying no, but then everything had shifted as some wild something had lit up her eyes, and, amazingly, she\u2019d said yes. More than once, as he recalled.</p><p>But now, in the calm aftermath, with her brain returning to its normal sober and rules-following self, she was no doubt cursing herself and him, too. And so he was surprised again when she ran a caressing hand down his back, when she entwined one of her legs with his, her foot massaging his calf absently.</p><p>He pressed his lips against her neck and rose up on his elbows so he could see her face. She gave him a lazy half smile, then tugged his head down and kissed him thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cEverything you advertised and more, Lord Donlon,\u201d she said, her husky voice the stuff of a man\u2019s fantasies, especially when the woman it belonged to was naked beneath him.</p><p>\u201cHappy to oblige, Special Agent.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn laughed softly. \u201cHmmm. Tell me, is it true what they say about vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What do they say?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hips against his, and his cock, still buried deep inside her, jumped happily. Kathryn made an appreciative noise, and it was Lucas\u2019s turn to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d he murmured, and flexed his hips, causing his rapidly growing erection to glide in and out of her soaking wet pussy. \u201cYes, a cuisle, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d she purred, and wrapped her leg around his hips. She began to move beneath him, her body rippling along his like warm satin.</p><p>Desire coursed through Lucas\u2019s bloodstream once more. Her core was already heated and wet, her inner walls still trembling and so sensitive that she was already on the verge of an orgasm. He watched her face as he plunged deep inside her once more, her eyes closed, skin flushed and glowing with moisture. He lowered his mouth to hers and licked the seam of her lips. Kathryn tightened her hold on his neck and pulled him closer, her mouth opening as his lips met hers, their tongues curling in a slow, erotic dance. They knew each other better now, knew the rhythm of the other\u2019s body, the taste of the other\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Lucas felt his gums split as his fangs emerged, lusting after another taste of her blood. The sharp points scraped along Kathryn\u2019s tongue in the midst of their kiss, and her eyes flashed open, going wide with surprise. He knew what she was seeing, knew his eyes had gone completely gold with desire, with hunger. He nearly lost it when her tongue reached up to explore his now fully distended fangs, twining around the hard enamel, pressing the flat of her tongue against one sharp point until it nicked her flesh. A tiny drop of blood swelled, filling his senses with the honeyed taste of Kathryn. Lucas growled.</p><p>Her nipples went rock hard against his chest, and her abdomen flexed beneath his as she moaned softly. \u201cLucas,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t . . . oh God, I don\u2019t know if I . . .\u201d And then she cried out, thrusting against him frantically as her womb contracted in another climax, her pussy trembling as it squeezed around him.</p><p>Lucas smiled against her soft cheek, smugly satisfied with himself as he continued to pump his cock in and out. Her body was so hot, so wet and soft. He wanted to fuck her for hours. He wanted to make her scream in ecstasy until she had no voice left.</p><p>He kissed her again, forcing her lips to part beneath his, her breath coming in pants as she groaned over and over, the sounds coming from deep in her chest. Lucas flicked his tongue up and stabbed one of his fangs deep enough into his own flesh that blood welled up instantly. Not the tiny drop that Kathryn had bled, but a steady flow. He coated her mouth and tongue with his blood, giving her no choice but to drink. Not that she fought it. Kathryn got that first tiny taste of his blood and began to swallow greedily, her tongue twisting around his, sucking hard, then sweeping every drop of it from her mouth, and pushing into his to claim the rest.</p><p>Her moans became a needy keen as his blood hit her throat and was absorbed into her bloodstream. She began bucking beneath him, murmuring his name over and over again like a mantra . . . or a prayer. Lucas growled and slammed his hips into hers, his cock growing impossibly hard as her body closed around him, as she scraped her dull nails up his back and dug strong fingers into his shoulders.</p><p>Lucas licked the side of her neck, wanting another taste of her blood, waiting for . . .</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d she whispered, her voice a rasp of need. \u201cDo it, do it, do it, damn it!\u201d</p><p>Lucas sank his fangs into her neck with no further warning. With the first hit of the euphoric in his bite, Kathryn\u2019s entire body seized around him, her back arching to press her beautiful breasts against his chest, thighs tightening around his hips as her pussy grabbed hold of his cock and didn\u2019t let go.</p> <p>Lucas snarled against the skin of her neck, his fangs still buried in her vein. His cock bucked, trying to dig deeper into her body. His balls tightened, pressure building as his own climax roared down upon him, irresistible, hot, demanding. He shoved his cock past the trembling grip of her vaginal walls, burying himself inside her until he could go no further, and then he was coming, pumping almost mindlessly as he filled Kathryn\u2019s womb with his hot release, searing his claim to her inside and out. And God save anyone who tried to take her from him.</p><p>Kathryn was becoming one with the mattress. She couldn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t want to. Had she ever in her life felt so satisfied, so utterly sated? Something twitched deep inside her, sending a fresh ripple of pleasure out to tweak her clit one more time. She bit back a groan. Is this what having sex with a vampire did to a woman? Turned her into a sex machine? She almost groaned again, but this time the groan was because she\u2019d even thought the words sex machine. Next she\u2019d be hearing cheesy background music in her head.</p><p>So she\u2019d had sex with a beautiful man, and it had been terrific. Okay, more than terrific. Life altering. She should be thanking her lucky stars instead of bemoaning the fact that she\u2019d climaxed three times in one night, which was probably more times than in all of the last five years combined, not counting her trusty vibrator. And Lucas was far, far better than her vibrator. The man was a god. No, actually, he was a vampire. No wonder all those women at the club were squealing like hungry pigs when those big, bad boys had walked in. Not, she was sure, that any of them could hold a candle to her Lucas.</p><p>Her Lucas? When had be become her Lucas?</p><p>Good thing she was leaving tomorrow, or rather later this morning. She couldn\u2019t afford to get tangled up with a man or a vampire, especially not one who lived in South Dakota and currently had an insufferably smug look on his face.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him, but he just grinned back at her and flexed his perfect ass one more time. She couldn\u2019t help it. Her body responded, squeezing his cock and making her nipples harden like puffy, pink pearls.</p><p>\u201cInsufferable,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cAt least,\u201d he agreed readily.</p><p>Kathryn fought it, but she laughed, then slapped his butt. \u201cGet off of me. You weigh a ton.\u201d</p><p>Lucas rolled away cheerfully, wrapping his arms around her so she came with him. He patted her ass in turn and kissed her swollen lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re delicious, Kathryn Hunter.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn lowered her head so he wouldn\u2019t see her blush of pleasure. No one had ever told her she was delicious. For that matter, she\u2019d never even felt delicious before. But at this moment, she did. Lucas had done that.</p><p>Time to change the subject.</p><p>She raised her head from his chest and met his steady gaze. \u201cWhat is it with your eyes?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey go completely gold sometimes, and I think they actually give off light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d he agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s a vampire thing. When our power comes up, or when we see something we lust after,\u201d he added, lifting his hips so she could feel the still-hard length of his cock against her thigh, \u201cour eyes change. The greater the power, or the desire, the brighter they glow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled.</p><p>\u201cAre everyone\u2019s eyes the same color? Or does it depend? I mean, your eyes are kind of a goldish hazel all the time anyhow. But what if they were blue instead?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s different for everyone, although most vampires, the rank and file, so to speak, simply gleam red. Those of us with greater power are more unique.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn rolled her eyes, although she had to agree that Lucas was unique. \u201cSo pretty eyes go with being a vampire lord, then,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAmong other things, yes.\u201d</p> <p>She studied him for a moment, then said seriously, \u201cLucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathryn,\u201d he mimicked, matching her tone.</p><p>\u201cWhere did all that blood come from on your pants earlier? And what happened to Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>Lucas stared back at her for a long moment, his hand growing still against the skin of her back. She thought he wouldn\u2019t answer, or that he\u2019d come up with another lie, but then he surprised her by saying, \u201cVampires are territorial, Kathryn. Viciously, obsessively territorial. Vampire lords even more so than others. And we\u2019re violent. It\u2019s in our blood. Whatever it is that makes us Vampire amplifies aggression until it\u2019s a constant thing, something we have to work hard to discipline, so we can function in our day-to-day lives.</p><p>\u201cAs a vampire lord, I rule a territory. To every side of me, there is another territory, another vampire lord. These territorial boundaries are old and well-established, but occasionally, someone decides he wants more. When that happens, we go to war.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWar?\u201d she repeated, frowning. \u201cYou mean like shooting and killing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling, yes. But there\u2019s very little shooting involved. Vampires are capable of using weapons of all sorts. I\u2019m sure you noticed the MP5s used by my gate security, along with several other guns or knives you probably didn\u2019t see. This is mostly to impress humans who might think to test my security. But the truth is that our best weapon, the one we use against each other, is ourselves. Vampires are strong, fast and deadly. As I said, we\u2019re a violent people.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn mulled over what he was telling her. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying another vampire lord is trying to take some of your territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you had some sort of confrontation with him that got bloody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, but close enough. You needn\u2019t worry about Nicholas, by the way. By tomorrow morning, there will be nothing but a fresh scar, a day later, not even that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can heal that quickly?\u201d she said in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cSome of us. And some of us need help. A vampire lord rules his people, but he has an obligation to them as well. What is it your Bible says? \u2018To whom much has been given, much will be expected?\u2019 I\u2019m certain your priests would be appalled to see it used thusly, but it is never more true than among vampires. We live it every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does it work? The healing, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know the science. We don\u2019t want to know. And we certainly don\u2019t want humans to know. They\u2019d be chasing after us with those pitchforks again, but this time for our blood.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stared at him, nearly face to face. They were lying so close. Naked skin to naked skin, their bodies fitted together perfectly, as if they\u2019d been made for this one moment. He gave her a crooked smile, and she felt her heart swell.</p><p>Oh, no, she bemoaned silently. Not Lucas Donlon. What the hell was wrong with her?</p><p>\u201cKathryn, a cuisle, it is nearly dawn.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him blankly before it hit her. Vampire. Oh. My. God.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens?\u201d she asked with some urgency. \u201cWhere do you have to go? Do you have a special\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffin?\u201d he supplied dryly.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she snapped. \u201cBut maybe a basement or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m touched, a cuisle, but no. I do like my comforts, and this bed is perfectly fine. However, there are security precautions. Steel shutters will cover every window and door moments before sunrise. These walls, as you may already have surmised, look flimsy, but are, in fact, rather severely reinforced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will sleep. I have little choice in the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go, then,\u201d she said hesitantly. She didn\u2019t want to offend him, but now more than ever, Kathryn felt the need to get out of town, to flee to the TwinCities or anywhere else, as long as it took her far away from Lucas Donlon. He was a temptation, a complication, that she couldn\u2019t afford. She had a job back in Quantico. A job she had fought and clawed her way into. She tried to imagine what her superiors would say if she became involved with a vampire lord. Most of the people at the FBI viewed vampires as criminals, and that was just the regular run-of-the-mill vampires. Vampire lords were viewed with far less favor, if that was possible.</p><p>\u201cI need to go,\u201d she said more urgently.</p><p>Lucas gave her a puzzled look, as if aware of the turmoil inside her head and not understanding the cause of it. That look tugged painfully on her heart and made her want to cry. Another thing she hadn\u2019t done in years.</p><p>\u201cKathryn?\u201d he said, with obvious concern. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She shook her head, as if that could brush away her feelings. \u201cOf course. But I really do have to leave. I have things to do tomorrow, or rather later today, and I don\u2019t want to compromise your security.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to push away from the embrace of his powerful body, from the warmth in his golden eyes. She leaned down for one final kiss, then jumped up and headed for the bathroom before he could see the tears filling her eyes.</p><p>Lucas let Kathryn go as she hurried away. He wasn\u2019t as sensitive to emotions as his friend Duncan, but even he could tell that there was some sort of battle going on inside Kathryn\u2019s excellent brain. Guilt, maybe? She\u2019d probably broken some FBI rule or other about sleeping with witnesses. Although he wasn\u2019t technically a witness, since he hadn\u2019t seen anything. Or maybe she was feeling guilty about enjoying herself instead of spending every moment searching for her brother. Given what he knew about their relationship, that seemed likely. He could even understand it if she felt that way.</p><p>He flexed his abdominal muscles and sat straight up in bed before swinging his legs over the side. He wasn\u2019t the kind of man who lay in bed while his lover dragged her clothes on and scurried out the door. Kicking the ruined leather pants to one side, he pulled a pair of fresh sweats out of his closet and slipped them on, along with a matching gray T-shirt. He strolled out to the living room and located Kathryn\u2019s clothing for her\u2014her dress, shoes, jacket. . . even those ridiculous leggings she\u2019d donned to protect herself against unwanted attention at the blood house. As if a pair of pants would deter any vampire worth his salt.</p><p>Walking back into the bedroom, he shook out the articles of clothing and laid them on the bed in a neat pile, then searched around the bed until he found the tiny black thong she\u2019d been wearing. He was tempted to keep that as a memento, but decided not to tease her, and laid it on top of the dress next to her sensible white bra. He took a moment to imagine Kathryn\u2019s beautiful breasts encased in silk and lace instead of ordinary cotton, her dusky rose nipples visible as they rose up hard and pressed against the sheer silk.</p><p>The bathroom door opened to reveal a naked Kathryn, and his cock sprang instantly to attention. Lucas caught her around the waist as she hurried past, pulling her against his body. He dipped his fingers between her legs and found her still hot and wet from their lovemaking.</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely certain you have to go?\u201d he whispered against her ear.</p><p>Kathryn closed her eyes, leaned her head against his shoulder, and expelled a long sighing breath. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t,\u201d she murmured, her husky voice breathless with desire. \u201cBut I have to get up early in the morning. I have things to do.\u201d</p><p>Lucas kissed the side of her neck and released her, but not before slipping one finger into her wetness and bringing it to his lips for a taste.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s eyes flared she watched him taste the cream coating his fingers. \u201cDelicious, a cuisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot fair,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play fair,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember that, Kathryn.\u201d</p><p>Lucas watched as she dressed, taking pleasure in the heat of embarrassment that colored her cheeks. He helped her on with her jacket, then walked her outside and gave her a lingering kiss good-bye, a promise of things to come. He waited until she was safely in her vehicle and away before entering the security code to initiate the daylight safety measures. The steel shutters he\u2019d mentioned to Kathryn deployed instantly, sliding down in near silence over every door, window, and vent, until the exterior walls were a solid steel surface and nearly impregnable. Nearly, because anything was possible. Only death was 100 percent safe.</p><p>Lucas felt the hot sun peeking over the horizon as he stripped away his sweats and fell into the bed. He lifted the sheets and smelled Kathryn, not her perfume\u2014she didn\u2019t wear any\u2014but her arousal, the scent of their lovemaking. His cock hardened at the reminder, and he stroked it absently, thinking of all the things he had yet to enjoy with his luscious FBI agent.</p><p>He was still smiling when sleep took him, and he dreamed.</p><p>1791, Kildare County, Ireland</p><p>Lucas crouched small and silent in the great hall of his grandfather\u2019s castle. Or so his mother told him. He\u2019d never known before today that he had a grandfather, much less one with a castle. But it was certainly grand. As big as the cathedral in town where he and his mother lived, bigger even when one added in outbuildings and stables.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to linger in those stables. There\u2019d been horses there, great, beautiful beasts like the ones ridden by the lords and merchants in town. He\u2019d entertained the fancy that he might be permitted to ride one, this being his own grandfather\u2019s estate and all. But his mother had snatched him away, and the man she called Father had quickly dashed any hope Lucas had of getting near the animals. The giant of an old man had barely acknowledged Lucas\u2019s existence, and certainly not as a blood relation. He\u2019d taken one look at Lucas standing there holding his mother\u2019s hand, then spit to one side and walked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which was how Lucas came to be hiding behind a chair, spying on his mother and the stern-looking old woman facing her across the hearth. He peered out from behind a fur throw that smelled of dog. Probably the giant wolfhounds he\u2019d seen roaming his grandfather\u2019s castle, the ones the old man gave far more affection and attention than his grandson.</p><p>Lucas was only six, and he didn\u2019t understand much of what old people did, but he knew what it meant to be spat upon. And it wasn\u2019t a good thing. Especially not from one\u2019s own grandfather.</p><p>But the old man wasn\u2019t here now. Only the woman his mother had told him was his grandmother\u2014another revelation. Lucas hadn\u2019t known he had family other than his mother before today, and suddenly he had grandparents, and probably more. Some of his friends had grandparents, and they had cousins and all sorts of relations to go with them.</p> <p>\u201cYou look a fright, Brighid.\u201d</p><p>His grandmother\u2019s voice drew him back to the drafty room, his narrow chest swelling with outrage at her words. His mother was beautiful! He\u2019d heard some of the men in town, and even the women, comment on her beauty, though he didn\u2019t need anyone to tell him what his own eyes could see. On the verge of jumping up to defend his mother\u2019s honor, he abruptly sank back down, remembering that he was spying on the women. They would only send him away if he was discovered, and he had a feeling important things were being said, things he needed to hear. There had to be a reason his mother had brought them so far to this grand castle. She\u2019d told him this was home, but it didn\u2019t feel like home. The only home he knew was the single room they shared back in the city.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Mother,\u201d Lucas\u2019s mother was saying, her usually gentle voice hard with some emotion he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cIt is difficult to maintain a proper wardrobe when one barely has enough food to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no need to be coarse, Brighid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. By all means, let us not be coarse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBitterness does not become you, child.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s mother laughed. \u201cWhat do I have to be bitter about? That my own father disowned me? That he left me and my child to starve on the streets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is your own sins that brought you to this. And you are not starving in any case. A bit thin perhaps, but the boy looks healthy enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas is perfect,\u201d his mother said fiercely, and Lucas swelled with pride.</p><p>The old woman only lifted her lip, as if she\u2019d tasted an ale that had gone sour. \u201cYour father would take you back. Make a good marriage for you, despite your . . . unfortunate situation. There are men who would not mind a young, strong woman. Men who would be willing to overlook your earlier indiscretion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndiscretion? I was raped, Mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLord Danford staunchly denies your hysterical accusation. Why would he have bothered with a silly girl like you? His lovely lady wife had already given him two strong sons, and she has given him another plus a daughter since then. You do your father little honor with these fantastic tales. Danford is a loyal friend and supporter of your father, one of his most valued associates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously an associate of far greater value than his only child . . . or his grandson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard child is not your father\u2019s grandson.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s mother stood abruptly, her hands clenching in her skirt the way they did when she was upset. \u201cI know not why I came here,\u201d she said. \u201cOr why I thought anything would have changed.\u201d</p><p>The old woman looked up at his mother, unperturbed by her distress. \u201cYou should consider your father\u2019s offer. Lord Jamie is looking for a new wife now that poor Deirdre passed so suddenly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuddenly?\u201d his mother scoffed. \u201cShe was thirty years his junior when they married! The poor woman probably welcomed death after being chained to that vicious old man for so long. How many babes did he force on her? Ten, twelve? Which birth finally killed her, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Brighid. Your time away has made you most uncouth. You must school yourself if you hope to reclaim your father\u2019s good will.\u201d</p><p>His mother made a noise like a laugh, but it wasn\u2019t a happy sound. \u201cHis good will? Why? So he can bury me along with poor Deirdre? And what of Lucas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou would have to get rid of the boy, of course. There are men, I\u2019m told, who will take on unwanted children as laborers. It is a productive life. The best such a child can expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son is not unwanted. Farewell, Mother. Lucas!\u201d</p><p>He jumped up, eyes wide as he realized she\u2019d known all along he was there.</p><p>\u201cCome, sweetling,\u201d she said softly, holding out her hand. \u201cWe are leaving.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>South Dakota, present day</p><p>Kathryn cursed as she drove away into the pale, predawn light. It had been a huge mistake to sleep with Lucas Donlon. She never dated men she was seriously attracted to. Sure, she liked good-looking men, intelligent men, but the ones she dated were looking for the same thing she was\u2014a casual hook-up, scratching an itch, maybe a few pleasant dinners together. After all, men did it all the time, so why couldn\u2019t she do the same? Her brother said she was avoiding commitment, that after a lifetime of raising him, she had no desire to raise anyone else, including a husband, or even a boyfriend. She\u2019d always denied it, not because it wasn\u2019t true, but because she\u2019d never wanted him to think he\u2019d been a burden, that she\u2019d ever regretted even one day of his life.</p><p>But in the privacy of her own heart, she knew he was right. She wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship, had no desire to find the perfect man to settle down with. So, why in God\u2019s name had she weakened enough to spend any time at all with Lucas, much less to have sex with him? Did she love him? Hell, no. It was far too early to think that. But she hungered for him in a way she never had anyone else. She\u2019d just left, and already she could think of nothing but the next time she\u2019d see him. Her body was already so sensitized to his touch that the mere thought of him had her breasts plumping in anticipation, her thighs squeezing together against a need so strong she knew she could climax if she moved . . . precisely . . . the . . . right . . . way. She shuddered as a mini-orgasm trembled through her body.</p><p>This was ridiculous. Awful. A complete disaster. She had to get away from Lucas Donlon, as far and as fast as possible. Thank God she was finished with her investigation in this town. She had only to figure out something to do with her brother\u2019s equipment, and she could be gone. She certainly wouldn\u2019t be leaving Dan\u2019s cameras and stuff at Lucas\u2019s ranch, though she knew it would be safer there than anywhere else. Unfortunately, the ranch was probably the least safe place in the world for her right now. Or ever.</p><p>She could ship the stuff home. No, even better, ship it to her office. A quick email to warn them it was coming, and they\u2019d make sure it was held until she got back from vacation. Vacation. What a laugh. More like a nightmare. Her brother was still missing, and she was wasting time screwing a good-looking vampire. She shook her head. Good-looking didn\u2019t come close to describing Lucas Donlon.</p><p>Focus, Kathryn! Right, the equipment. Okay, so she was shipping it. But that meant boxing it up securely. Dan\u2019s cameras weren\u2019t the kind of thing you could simply toss into a FedEx box with some Styrofoam peanuts. She frowned. Had she even seen a FedEx place in town? She needed one of those big ones that did packaging as well as shipping, and she couldn\u2019t remember seeing one locally. Which meant she\u2019d have to travel to the nearby big city, \u201cbig\u201d being a relative term. But that would take time, and she needed to be gone before it got so late that she could, in any way, rationalize waiting for sunset. Because her body was already bombarding her brain with images of a naked Lucas between her thighs . . . on top of her, beneath her, inside her . . . Oh God, she needed to put some miles on the road and fast. No airport. There weren\u2019t enough flights, and waiting for a plane meant more delays, more time for her body to win the fight against her brain.</p><p>Her GPS dinged, warning her that the main highway was up ahead. At last! She turned off the primitive dirt road and onto the pavement. The rising sun set fire to her rearview mirror, and she squinted, nearly blinded by the reflection before shoving it aside and pressing the gas pedal as far down as it would go. She could probably talk her way out of a speeding ticket. The sheriff knew who she was after all, and . . .</p><p>That was it! Her brains must be more scrambled than she\u2019d thought if it had taken her this long to consider the obvious. She could leave Dan\u2019s camera equipment with the sheriff. He\u2019d hold it for her as a professional courtesy, if nothing else.</p><p>This was why she avoided emotional entanglements. They made her stupid.</p><p>Two hours later, the tiny town was behind her as she raced toward Minneapolis. Sheriff Sutcliffe had been more than happy to help her out, had even volunteered to arrange appropriate packing and shipping if she needed it. Kathryn had declined, not sure if she wanted to go that far yet. It would all depend on where her brother was\u2014and what kind of shape he was in when she found him. Because now, more than ever, she was convinced he was alive and that Alex Carmichael had him. What was it Lucas had said? If a vampire met a human he fancied, he took the human home for a while to play with, to taste.</p><p>And what could be more intriguing for a vampire like Alex Carmichael, someone who bought and sold beautiful art for a living, than a few weeks with a man whose work he admired? Her brother was alive. She simply had to find him and Carmichael before the novelty wore off.</p><p>Lucas opened his eyes, feeling troubled and not at all refreshed from his day\u2019s sleep. He rarely woke this way, but then he rarely dreamed anymore. And never of the only time he\u2019d visited Castle Donlon as a child. That visit had marked the end of his innocence. Everything fell apart after that, although as an adult he understood that things had been getting worse for some time before then. His mother had lost her seamstress position, which had been the thin thread between them and starvation. Desperation had driven her back to Kildare, to sacrifice her pride in hopes of getting help from her father before it was too late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If she\u2019d been willing to throw away her son that day, to throw away Lucas, they would have taken her back. He understood that now, too. Brighid had been their only child, and old Donal Donlon had been desperate to secure an heir for his estate, someone in a direct line to himself. His wife, Brighid\u2019s mother, had been too old to bear another child, and the church wouldn\u2019t let him set her aside. So he\u2019d been willing to take Brighid back, to marry her off to someone acceptable to his needs, if not to Brighid\u2019s, in hopes of securing a legitimate heir.</p><p>But Lucas\u2019s mother had loved him, despite the circumstances of his conception. He hadn\u2019t understood what rape meant when he was six, but he did later. And he\u2019d marveled that his mother had loved him despite it, loved him so fiercely that he\u2019d never doubted it, not for one moment.</p><p>But love didn\u2019t put food on the table, didn\u2019t pay the rent on their pitiful room. So she sold the only thing she had left. Herself. It shamed him still that she\u2019d been forced to such dire straits because of him. It was why he rarely thought about those times. Why he wasn\u2019t going to think about them anymore this evening either.</p> <p>He sat up and drew a deep breath into his lungs. And he thought of Kathryn. He snagged his cell phone from the side table and punched in her number. It went to voice mail, so he disconnected and dialed the motel instead.</p><p>\u201cMotel,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said, apparently feeling no obligation to announce which motel, since there was only the one in town.</p><p>\u201cHunter, room eighteen,\u201d Lucas requested.</p><p>\u201cNope. She checked out this morning.\u201d</p><p>Lucas froze. \u201cShe what?\u201d he asked in a voice so cold the poor night manager stuttered his reply.</p> <p>\u201cSh\u2014she checked out, sir. First thing this morning.\u201d</p><p>Lucas disconnected and threw the phone down before he crushed it. She\u2019d run. He\u2019d known there was something off about her emotions when she\u2019d left this morning, and now he understood. It wasn\u2019t that she felt nothing for him, because he knew she did. She\u2019d wanted him just as much as he\u2019d wanted her last night, and even this morning she\u2019d clearly wanted to stay. So why leave town so abruptly?</p><p>He snapped his fingers as it hit him. Kathryn was a control freak. Why the hell else had she become an FBI agent, one of those uptight clones of rigidity in their identical suits and ties? It had been written all over her that first night she\u2019d met him, in her buttoned up blouse and neat-as-a-pin pants suit. Always in control. But there was no such thing when it came to feelings, especially not when the sparks were flying like they had between them last night. Kathryn hadn\u2019t fled because she didn\u2019t want him, but because she did. And it terrified her. Finally something she couldn\u2019t control, so she\u2019d fled the scene rather than face him. He grabbed the cell phone again, intending to call her on her obvious cowardice, but changed his mind. He didn\u2019t need to go begging after a woman\u2019s attention. They usually came begging to him. This one hadn\u2019t, and it pissed him off. But there were other ways to corner his personal FBI agent, and he intended\u2014</p><p>His phone rang. \u201cYeah, Nick,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cSire, we have a target to retaliate against Klemens.\u201d</p><p>Lucas growled deep in his chest. \u201cFuckin\u2019 A. Where is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRockford. A hundred miles from Chicago, give or take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to fly. Have the jet prepped, and give Minneapolis a call. Klemens will know the minute I cross the border, so I want a helicopter waiting for us on the ground in Chicago. We\u2019ll chopper from there to Rockford. And tell Thad he\u2019s invited to the party. He can bring any of his survivors who can fight. No civilians. Warriors only. This isn\u2019t going to be pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord, when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave the SUVs out front in ten minutes. Payback\u2019s a bitch, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Thad was waiting for them when they landed at Chicago\u2019s ExecutiveAirport, located in a suburb just north of the city. Chicago was Klemens\u2019s home city in every sense of the word. He\u2019d been born there as a human and now ruled from there as a vampire. He\u2019d know by now that Lucas had crossed into his territory, though he wouldn\u2019t know precisely where just yet. And by the time he figured it out, Lucas would be on the move. Lucas didn\u2019t envy the vampires closest to Klemens tonight. They\u2019d be bearing the brunt of the vampire lord\u2019s anger, and rumor had it that Klemens didn\u2019t spare anyone when he was displeased.</p><p>\u201cI brought only two from the enclave, my lord,\u201d Thad was saying. \u201cMore wanted to come, but you said fighters only, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. This is going to be bloody, Thad. I know you can handle it, but what about the others?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth skilled fighters, my lord, and well-motivated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust your judgment. Zelma,\u201d he said, turning to greet the head of his Minneapolis nest as she joined them. \u201cEverything set?\u201d</p><p>Zelma was dressed in the same black combat clothing as the men. At no more than five and half feet tall, she was dwarfed by Lucas and the other warriors, but she was all muscle and skill. Female or not, Lucas had seen her fight and had no qualms about including her in the night\u2019s festivities.</p><p>\u201cThe transport helicopter is waiting, my lord,\u201d she replied. \u201cWith Thad\u2019s three and your ten, we\u2019ll be twenty strong once we get there.\u201d</p><p>They started across the tarmac at a fast walk, heading for the waiting helicopter. \u201cYou have recon on the site?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cI sent two scouts ahead as soon as Nick called. They drove, taking two separate SUVs, just in case we needed ground transportation once we got there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thinking. What do you know about the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an older house, two-story brick, on nine acres, which is a point in our favor. It\u2019s hell doing battle in a fucking suburb. This place has lots of trees, lots of cover. There\u2019s only one way in if you approach by car. It crosses over a small creek with a bridge. One ancient outbuilding, which my guys don\u2019t think is being used at all. Last report I had, one of them was trying to get closer to be certain, and maybe get a head count from inside the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Klemens\u2019s people warned, Zelma. If he can\u2019t do it quietly, tell him to back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him the same, my lord. They both know the ground rules.\u201d Her phone rang, and she checked the screen. \u201cThe scouts,\u201d she told Lucas, then answered the call. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>While Zelma got the scouting report, Lucas and the others were climbing aboard the helicopter, getting situated among the vampires already inside. Lucas and Nick settled into two of the most forward seats. The others shuffled deeper into the passenger bay. It said something, Lucas thought to himself, that he felt it necessary to own three of these heavy transport helicopters. His border squabbles with Klemens had been going on for as long as he could remember, almost from the first day Klemens had seized the MidwesternTerritory for himself. Klemens had never been satisfied with the limits of his holdings, even though the boundaries had been drawn and well-established long before he came to power. Lucas had been ruling the PlainsTerritory for nearly a hundred years before Klemens showed up next door. And the bastard had been a thorn in his side ever since.</p><p>He looked over as Zelma stepped up into the helicopter. Nick stood, letting her take the seat between them, so they could both hear her report. Before he sat again, he leaned into the pilot\u2019s compartment and gave the order to take off.</p><p>The noise from the copter ratcheted up quickly. Lucas grabbed the headset hanging over his seat and put it on, as Zelma and Nick did the same. Zelma glanced at Lucas, and seeing his nod, produced an iPad and pulled up not just a picture of the house but a map of the grounds, as well.</p><p>\u201cKlemens only purchased this place ten years ago. The old real estate listing is still there, and my computer guy pulled up the plat from the tax records. The scouts have it, too, and say it\u2019s pretty accurate. Doesn\u2019t show the surrounding landscape, of course, but I\u2019m more interested in the structures.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cWhat about numbers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scout who took a look is no master vampire, so it\u2019s a best guess. He says more than ten, fewer than twenty. All on the ground floor and, he assumes, the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe basement is almost certain,\u201d Nick commented.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Zelma said. \u201cAnd we have to assume the number of fighters is on the high end of his estimate. If it\u2019s lower, fine. If not, we\u2019re prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about numbers,\u201d Lucas reminded them impatiently. \u201cI\u2019ll know who\u2019s in that house as soon as I\u2019m on-scene.\u201d</p><p>Zelma dipped her head, clearly embarrassed. \u201cApologies, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded his understanding. He could feel battle lust beginning to grow in the vampires filling the big helicopter, the hunger for blood and violence. Zelma was a strong vampire and a good leader, but she wasn\u2019t immune to it, either. Even Nick\u2019s eyes were beginning to glow around the edges as his power rose in response to the thickening air of violence, and Nick had seen more battles at Lucas\u2019s side than anyone else here.</p><p>Lucas took the iPad from Zelma and studied the target. There was no cover directly around the house. They\u2019d be approaching in the open and uphill, but if Klemens\u2019s people weren\u2019t expecting them, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. The question was whether Klemens had sent out an alert to all of his vampires when he realized Lucas had crossed his border.</p><p>\u201cCan you call your scouts without giving away their position?\u201d he asked Zelma.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. Ask if they\u2019ve seen any indication that Klemens\u2019s people have been warned, any sudden burst of guard activity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKlemens knows you\u2019re here,\u201d she guessed accurately.</p><p>\u201cOf course. But did he think to warn this particular barracks?\u201d</p><p>Zelma\u2019s thumbs flew as she opted to contact her scouts via text. It was growing far too noisy in the helicopter for anything but a shouted conversation. Her grin grew as she read the response and when she looked up, her eyes were glowing red with eagerness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing, my lord. They\u2019ve located a single lookout and will take him out on your command.\u201d</p><p>Lucas frowned. If this were one of his border staging areas, he\u2019d have at least two fighters on patrol at all times. On the other hand, this particular house wasn\u2019t that far from Klemens\u2019s main headquarters in Chicago, so perhaps they felt secure enough not to bother. They\u2019d learn the error of their ways soon enough.</p><p>\u201cTell them to hang back, wait until I get there. I want to see for myself before we commit to anything.\u201d He flicked a switch and spoke to the pilot through his headset, \u201cETA?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwelve minutes, Sire. We\u2019re putting you down in a field a mile distant and downwind. They shouldn\u2019t hear a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d A mile run was nothing for his vampires, but he\u2019d have to be sure they knew the battle plan going in. Once they were on the ground and running, they\u2019d be on the hunt, their blood flowing hot, adrenaline pumping.</p><p>Lucas grinned savagely. This was going to be sweet.</p><p>Lucas stood perfectly still and stared up at the old house. As Zelma\u2019s real estate photo had shown, it was an older two-story brick with a pitched roof and a small sun porch to one side. He let his power wash lightly over the house, slithering into every crack, cupboard and closet, up every stair and down into the basement. He smiled. Klemens was going to be furious.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen vampires, one a master,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd no humans.\u201d This last was a relief. Humans would have greatly complicated his task tonight. He\u2019d handle the master himself, although Nick or even Zelma could probably do it as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe scouts were right, just the one lookout. Take him out now. Quietly, Zelma. I want no warning bells. We\u2019re going in hot. A blitz attack\u2014surround the house, overwhelming force. They\u2019re clearly not expecting anyone, and they\u2019re sure as hell not expecting me.\u201d</p><p>Zelma said a single word into her throat mike. They were all wearing similar communication gear, except Lucas. He didn\u2019t need electronics to communicate with his vampires, not once he unleashed the full measure of his power.</p><p>\u201cReady, my lord,\u201d Zelma and Nick both whispered at almost the exact same time.</p><p>Lucas climbed the hill slowly, loosening the bindings on his power a little more with every step he took. Living among humans meant wearing a mask. Not just a pleasant face for the locals to see, but lashing his power down tightly so he could walk on the street without buffeting humans and vampires aside, without rattling the walls when he grew angry, or sending entire rooms full of humans into an irrational panic they didn\u2019t understand. He was a vampire lord. He was power incarnate, but he rarely bared his true face to the world.</p><p>Tonight was one of those times, and he reveled in the beauty of it, as his power streamed out, surrounding him, waiting to be tapped, waiting for the taste of an enemy\u2019s blood. The darkness around Lucas lit with golden fire as his eyes reflected the rise of his power. Unnatural winds began to toss the trees overhead, growing stronger until the trees themselves bowed before it, thick trunks groaning as they gave in to the unstoppable force. Lucas swept his arms forward, gathering the wind and tossing it at the house. It hit with a thundering crack of sound, like a sonic boom. Windows spidered, then shattered. Shingles flew from the roof, and the sun room collapsed.</p><p>From inside the house, he heard the first cries of shock and fear. No matter how stalwart Klemens\u2019s warriors were, they had just become aware of the monster waiting outside in the dark. And they knew death had come to call.</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d Lucas whispered onto the wind, and every one of his vampires heard it as if he\u2019d spoken directly into their ear.They responded with a roar, crashing through doors and windows, racing into the house from all sides, howling for blood. Lucas cast his essence deeper into the house, seeding the air with terror, with every nightmare his enemies had ever dreamed. The screaming started as his vampires struck, the disbelieving cries of nearly immortal beings as they died.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s attention was drawn to a single vampire in a corner of the house, near the fireplace. It was the master vampire, the strongest of Klemens\u2019s creatures present. \u201cMine,\u201d he said, and walked through the gaping hole where the front door had once been.</p><p>Several of Lucas\u2019s vampires surrounded him as he strode forward. The fighting still raged deep in the house, a few diehards holding out against the inevitable. But the master vampire was waiting for Lucas, crouched in an attack position, fingers curled into claws and fangs dripping blood over his lower lip. His eyes were wild with fear as he looked upon Lucas, but they were filled with determination, too. He was too young to know his fate was already cast. Still, Lucas had to admire his courage in holding out as long as he had\u2014and in remaining standing at all in the face of Lucas\u2019s power.</p><p>Time to end that.</p><p>\u201cKneel,\u201d Lucas commanded softly and drove the vampire to his knees with a hammer blow of power.</p><p>The young master grunted in pain as his knees cracked against the hardwood floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you orders from Klemens?\u201d</p><p>The vampire glared at the surrounding vampires, then met Lucas\u2019s gaze defiantly. He knew, as Lucas did too, that Klemens would be on his way soon, if he wasn\u2019t already. Lucas\u2019s invasion of Klemens\u2019s territory would have been enough to put the Chicago vampire lord on alert, but the violent death of so many of his vampires at once would be a beacon telling him where Lucas had attacked. And this young master vampire thought he could hold out until his Sire arrived.</p> <p>Lucas smiled. \u201cHe\u2019ll never get here in time,\u201d he told the vampire almost sadly. \u201cI\u2019ll be long gone, and so will you.\u201d</p><p>The vampire blinked as he took in the meaning of Lucas\u2019s words, but remained defiant.</p><p>\u201cI can take it from your mind, boy,\u201d Lucas growled impatiently. \u201cIt will be less painful if you just tell me.\u201d</p><p>The vampire responded by spitting a glob of blood at Lucas\u2019s feet, and Lucas laughed. \u201cI like your spirit. Too bad it\u2019s wasted on that bastard Klemens. The hard way it is, then.\u201d</p><p>Lucas sifted his power into the young master\u2019s brain, immobilizing him even as he rooted through the vampire\u2019s thoughts. He flashed quickly through recent memory, seeing Klemens\u2019s hateful face and then a safe. In the basement. How quaint.</p><p>He withdrew from his captive\u2019s head and took a step back. The vampire was slumped forward, head hanging, chin nearly resting on his chest. But he was still breathing. Lucas considered his prisoner. He had everything he needed from this one, or at least everything the vampire had to give him. The only thing left was death. He couldn\u2019t afford to leave the enemy vampire alive, but he could kill him painlessly.</p><p>With what was clearly a supreme effort, the young master vampire raised his head. His eyes were unfocused, and he blinked several times before he was able to glare his hatred at Lucas once more. \u201cMy Sire will kill you,\u201d he rasped. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Lucas replied cheerfully, then slammed his fist into the vampire\u2019s chest and ripped out his heart. \u201cBut you\u2019ll see your beloved Sire there long before you\u2019ll see me.\u201d</p><p>The vampire crumbled into dust. Lucas\u2019s vampires swore and stepped back quickly to avoid getting splashed with any of it. Why they bothered, Lucas didn\u2019t know, since they were already liberally painted with the blood of their enemies.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d he said, almost casually.</p><p>\u201cSire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a safe in the basement. I want everything that\u2019s in it. Everything. Zelma, get that helicopter over here to pick us up, then detail two of your people to drive the SUVs. I want them gone before we leave.\u201d</p><p>While Nick and Zelma ran to follow his orders, Lucas gazed around the demolished house. His people had taken him literally, coming in from all sides. Every door and window he laid eyes on was destroyed, and someone had actually broken through the wall from the sun porch. The air was thick with the dust of too many dead vampires. It was a musty stench, with an overlay of old blood. He heard the helicopter come in to hover overhead and strode back through the house quickly. He might not mind the smell of his dead enemies, but he didn\u2019t want to be covered in their dust from the helicopter\u2019s rotor wash, either. He kept going until he was under the dark trees, then took a moment to cast his awareness out, searching for Klemens.</p><p>Ah. There he was. And as mad as a wet hen.</p><p>Nicholas, he sent to his lieutenant\u2019s mind. Get everyone on the helicopter now.</p><p>He sensed Nicholas\u2019s attention and then the urgent emotions of his vampire warriors as they rushed to obey. The SUVs were already gone, their red taillights flickering through the trees as they turned onto the main road, heading away from Chicago to avoid passing Klemens\u2019s incoming gang on the road. They\u2019d head for the Iowa border, which was Lucas\u2019s territory and less than a hundred miles distant. At vampire speeds, that was little more than an hour\u2019s drive. Lucas and his helicopter troops would fly directly to Minneapolis. The jet that had flown them to Chicago had already departed and was waiting for them there. But Lucas would bed down for the day in Minneapolis again. Although this time, he\u2019d be sleeping in his private penthouse condo, not bunking in the basement vault of the Minneapolis house, no matter how comfortable it was.</p><p>Between the looming sun and his crashing adrenaline, Lucas was definitely ready to rest. He was pleased with the night\u2019s work, however. He\u2019d flipped Klemens the finger by flying into his own capital city for the raid and then destroying seventeen of the vampire lord\u2019s warriors and stealing whatever data there had been in the safe. It had been a very satisfying night, definitely one for the good guys\u2014which he had no doubt he and his vampires were. He was looking forward to crashing in the giant bed he\u2019d had custom-made for his Minneapolis penthouse. Only one thing was needed to make it a perfect night. Kathryn Hunter. But somehow he doubted she\u2019d be waiting for him.</p><p>Minneapolis, MN</p><p>Kathryn woke sluggishly, confused by the complete absence of light. She had a full two seconds of alarm before registering the sounds and smells of a hotel. Right. Minneapolis. Hotel. Blackout curtains. She\u2019d driven all day yesterday, intending to confront Carmichael at his gallery last night. But she\u2019d been so worn-out by the time she arrived in the Twin Cities that she\u2019d wisely put off the confrontation and fallen straight into bed instead. She might be carrying a badge, but Carmichael was a vampire, and she wasn\u2019t even the slightest bit suicidal. The last thing she wanted was to challenge him when she was too tired to think straight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She fumbled for her cell phone to check the time and was surprised to see she\u2019d managed to sleep several hours. Of course, now she was wide awake and faced an entire day with nothing to do but wait for sunset and vampires.</p><p>She rolled out of bed and started the coffee maker. With the first lifesaving cup of caffeine burning its way through her stomach, she checked her email, hoping against hope that there\u2019d be something from Daniel or even his agent, Penny. But no luck. Not that she\u2019d really expected it.</p><p>Trolling for ways to kill time that didn\u2019t involve daytime television, she\u2019d decided to put down on paper everything she knew\u2014a timeline beginning with Dan\u2019s last known activities and adding in everything she\u2019d discovered so far. That took all of an hour and got her nowhere. She didn\u2019t need a visual aid to know the details of this case. They were imprinted on the back of her brain. She saw them whenever she closed her eyes, like a nonstop video display that just kept repeating over and over again.</p> <p>Finally, in a bid to retain what little sanity she had left, she pulled on her workout clothes, including the winter weight leggings she\u2019d packed especially for this trip, and took the elevator down to the lobby. The hotel had a gym, but what she really needed was some fresh air and sunlight. There was a group of men in suits hogging the front desk, so she wandered over to the concierge desk, which was unstaffed at this early hour. Buried amidst the many tourist brochures, she found a runner\u2019s map which detailed several excellent routes, broken down by stamina and level of training. Since Kathryn ran every day, and that didn\u2019t include the extra training she put in on the Bureau\u2019s cross country trails, she chose the most challenging route, pulled up the hood on her sweatshirt and headed out into the sunny Minneapolis morning.</p><p>Halfway through the route, she found herself near the same huge mall where she\u2019d bought the black dress she\u2019d worn to Lucas\u2019s club on Friday, just two days ago. Remembering when she\u2019d worn the dress made her remember when Lucas had helped her take the dress off, which then reminded her of the plain white bra she\u2019d been wearing underneath the dress. She frowned. Her ordinary work bras were the only ones she\u2019d packed, other than her sports bra, which was even worse. But, getting naked with Lucas had made her choice of bra seem stodgy. They made sense when she was working. She couldn\u2019t have some lacey thing outlined beneath her cotton blouses, couldn\u2019t have her breasts bouncing around every time she walked. But that didn\u2019t mean she had to be sensible all the time. Besides, a girl could never have too much underwear.</p><p>That was her story, and she was sticking to it.</p><p>Decision made, Kathryn detoured and jogged into the mall itself. She knew there was a Victoria\u2019s Secret inside, because she\u2019d passed it by the day she\u2019d bought the dress. If she\u2019d known she was going to be disrobing in front of Lucas Donlon, she might have stopped. But this morning, she found it easily and started inside, suffering a moment\u2019s hesitation when she caught a reflection of herself in the plate glass window. In her leggings and hoodie, with no makeup and a ponytail tucked under a sweaty baseball cap, she obviously wasn\u2019t dressed for lingerie shopping. She almost didn\u2019t go in, but then two women walked out and gave her the kind of look usually reserved for someone trying to bum money for booze on the street corner. That decided it. Kathryn\u2019s father had always claimed that the one way to make sure Kathryn did something was to suggest that she couldn\u2019t. She thought she\u2019d outgrown that impulse, especially once she\u2019d gotten old enough to figure out her dad was using it against her. But apparently, it still worked.</p><p>Casting the two women a dismissive glance, she yanked off her baseball cap, pulled the scrunchy out of her ponytail and fluffed her hair, then strode into the shop.</p> <p>An hour later, she\u2019d spent nearly two hundred dollars on lingerie that most likely no one would ever see but her. God knew, she wouldn\u2019t be wearing that lovely sea foam green lace and silk set to work, and since that was the only place she ever went . . . Ah well. She did date occasionally, and she could always dance around her condo in it.</p><p>Leaving the store, she stopped and put the bag on the floor near her feet, tugged her hair back into its ponytail and covered it with her cap. Then she hooked the bag over her arm and geared herself up for the run back to the hotel.</p><p>By the time she hurried into the lobby, she was both sweaty and cold. The sky, which had been sunny earlier, had clouded over. It wasn\u2019t cold enough to snow, but a light rain had started on her last mile, and her running clothes weren\u2019t meant for rain. Not to mention she\u2019d been worried about her new, expensive lingerie being ruined.</p><p>She raced up to her fourth floor room, taking the stairs to avoid forcing anyone to share an elevator with her stinky, sweaty self. She stripped off her clothes, took a long, hot shower and settled onto the bed with some reading material she\u2019d brought for the plane. She made it through two pages before drifting off to sleep.</p><p>She dreamed of making love to Lucas Donlon and woke feeling guilty about not having told him she was leaving, not saying good-bye, or even leaving a message. She usually wasn\u2019t so cowardly. Maybe she\u2019d call tonight. Talk to him from the safety of several hundred miles distance. She could always claim she\u2019d decided at the last minute, and tell him truthfully that she\u2019d been so tired when she arrived last night that she\u2019d fallen straight into bed.</p><p>Logging onto her laptop, she checked the website for Alex Carmichael\u2019s gallery. A new show had opened yesterday, but tonight was the big gala opening event. She glanced at the clock and knew she wouldn\u2019t make it on time. She had serious bedhead and would need to wash and dry her hair before socializing amongst the trendy types. She shrugged. Better to be fashionably late and look good, than the alternative.</p> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Lucas woke that night with a feeling he hadn\u2019t had in a very long time\u2014the visceral satisfaction that came from having tasted the blood of his enemy, and knowing he\u2019d struck a powerful blow. He stretched, joints popping with the effort, his muscles feeling loose and relaxed. The only thing he needed now was a beautiful woman in his bed, with both her blood and body hot and pumping for him.</p><p>Only one woman came to mind, however. Kathryn Hunter. She thought she could hide from him. She clearly didn\u2019t understand who and what he was. He rolled over and snagged his cell phone, punching up Nick.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Nick answered at once, sounding as if he\u2019d just woken. Which he had.</p><p>\u201cCan we track Kathryn\u2019s cell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, but I\u2019m not sure we want to. The phone she uses is government-issue, and she is FBI, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. What about the rental car then? Don\u2019t they all have transponders these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do, and we can. I already made note of the rental company she used, so it won\u2019t take long. I\u2019ll get our people on it.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas disconnected and threw the phone down. He lay back on the pillows and began stroking his cock lazily, pumping his fist up and down as he remembered the taste and feel of Kathryn. She thought to escape him by running, but he was Vampire, the ultimate predator. And for a true predator, there was nothing more exciting than the hunt. Especially one with the promise of blood and sex at the end. He groaned as he climaxed, his seed spilling between his fingers and over his clenched fist. And he knew that before the night was over, the only fist around his cock would be the silken heat of Kathryn Hunter.</p><p>Kathryn stared at the questionable example of cubism on the wall of Carmichael\u2019s gallery and wondered how the same gallery that showcased her brother\u2019s photography could also feature this. Even as she thought it, she knew it was stupid. Alex Carmichael would probably sneer at her and tell her that a person of taste recognized it in whatever form it took. She didn\u2019t know about taste, but she did know that many of the world\u2019s premier museums hung all sorts of work, from Monet to Andy Warhol and everything in between. Still, she stared at the oil painting in front of her with its bold colors and puzzling composition, and couldn\u2019t make it work. She snuck a sideways look at the price tag and decided it was just as well, since it was far beyond her decorating budget.</p><p>She smiled, thinking that Dan would have chided her, saying that art was not for decoration. Her smile disappeared as she glanced around the crowded gallery. She\u2019d come here hoping to find Alex Carmichael. More than ever, she was convinced he was the key to her brother\u2019s disappearance. But so far, he was a no-show, and the champagne was beginning to dwindle.</p><p>She tapped her foot impatiently, wondering if she should give up and go back to her hotel.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nearly jumped out of her shoes at the question. Jarred out of her thoughts, she turned to stare at the man who had somehow sidled up to stand right next to her without her even noticing.</p><p>Great instincts, Hunter. Good thing he\u2019s only interested in art.</p><p>She glanced in his direction, and they shared a smile. He was nicely dressed, with short, dark hair, and not at all bad-looking. Two days ago, she probably would have called him handsome. But that was before Lucas Donlon had destroyed her perceptions of male beauty forever. She turned her attention back to the painting so her fellow art lover wouldn\u2019t notice the scowl brought on by that last thought.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . rather bold, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she commented, trying to be sociable. The observation was ambiguous enough that it could be admiration or criticism, whichever he preferred.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he agreed enthusiastically.</p><p>Admiration it is, she thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cI love the color in this work,\u201d the man continued. \u201cToo many cubists lack the courage of their art. This says boldly, \u2018This is who I am, take it or leave it.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stared at the oil painting and nodded, though she personally thought it said something more along the lines of, \u201cI never moved beyond the small box of crayons.\u201d</p><p>A ripple of movement across the room caught her eye as Francoise, Alex\u2019s perky assistant, touched the tiny Bluetooth device in her ear and abruptly took perky to a whole new level. The woman had been working the crowds all evening, apparently playing hostess in her boss\u2019s absence. Kathryn had noticed her eyeing the door more than once and had optimistically guessed that Alex himself would soon make an appearance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And now Francoise was finally hurrying eagerly toward the entrance. Kathryn felt her own excitement pitching higher in anticipation as she followed Francoise\u2019s eager progress and saw three big, black SUVs pull up out front. Ignoring the valet attendant, they parked at the curb, one in front of the other. Doors popped open and bodyguards spilled onto the sidewalk like a SWAT team, but wearing nicely tailored suits instead. One of them came around from the street side, and Kathryn got her first good look at him.</p><p>Her stomach plummeted. It was Nicholas, which could only mean one thing.</p><p>Kathryn shifted slightly to the right, so she was no longer in direct sight of the front door. It was easy enough, since most of the gallery goers were shuffling the other direction, going toward the doors to get a better look at the new arrival who they clearly understood was someone important, maybe even famous. From the whispered conversations all around her, they didn\u2019t know exactly who it was, but speculation ran the gamut from a movie star to the mayor or the president. No one seemed to think it was Alex, but then Kathryn already knew that. It was a vampire all right, but not the one she had come here to find.</p> <p>Outside, Nicholas took a last look up and down the street, then opened the back door of the middle SUV. And there he was. Lucas Donlon in all his glory, looking devastatingly handsome in a black wool suit, with the thinnest gray pinstripe, and a bronze silk tie with some tiny gold pattern gleaming against his white shirt. His too-long black hair was neatly combed away from his face so that he was the very image of a successful Wall Street titan. He was perfect. Damn him.</p><p>Over at the front door, Francoise was beside herself with joy. She waited right in front of the glass door like a child who\u2019d just spotted Santa. Her face was glowing, her hands clasped and tucked under her chin, as if she couldn\u2019t contain her excitement.</p><p>Two of the bodyguards entered first\u2014Kathryn recognized Mason as one of them\u2014and then Nicholas and Lucas behind him. Obviously well versed in vampire protocol, Francoise waited until Lucas approached her, and then she gushed like a schoolgirl.</p><p>\u201cLord Donlon, this is such an honor!\u201d</p><p>Get a grip, woman, Kathryn thought sourly, shifting again to put more people between her and Lucas, concealing her while still letting her see everything.</p> <p>\u201cWho do you think that is?\u201d her art lover companion asked.</p><p>Kathryn glanced at him, irritated at the distraction. She\u2019d forgotten he was there. Fortunately, he\u2019d spoken without looking at her because, like everyone else in the gallery, he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Lucas. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d she all but snarled in his direction.</p><p>\u201cFrancoise,\u201d Lucas crooned, drawing Kathryn\u2019s attention back to the spectacle. \u201cDon\u2019t you look lovely this evening.\u201d</p><p>Sickening. He probably says that to every woman he meets.</p><p>Francoise tittered, her cheeks lighting up like stop signs.</p><p>\u201cIs Alex around?\u201d Lucas asked, scanning the gallery.</p> <p>Sneak. Liar. Sneaky liar. He\u2019s probably been communicating with Alex this whole time.</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord,\u201d the assistant was saying. \u201cI expected him, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancoise, love, call me Lucas. And I think I\u2019ll just look around myself, if that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Lucas. Just . . .\u201d She stretched up closer to his ear and whispered something too softly for Kathryn to make out. Whatever it was made Lucas chuckle. He stroked his hand down the woman\u2019s skinny arm, which had her positively beaming with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cLet me get the show catalogue for you,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>It\u2019s a wonder she can speak with her tongue hanging out like that, Kathryn thought viciously. She watched Francoise mince her way over to pick up one of the glossy catalogues. And what\u2019s with the \u2018Francoise, love\u2019 crap? Lucas was such a fucking dog. She\u2019d absolutely done the right thing in\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe dress looks much better without the leggings,\u201d Lucas observed from right next to her.</p><p>Kathryn cursed her stupidity. She\u2019d been so focused on Francoise that she\u2019d forgotten the biggest threat in the room. She should have slipped out the back door the moment she recognized Nicholas coming around the SUV. Assuming this stupid gallery had a back door. But it had to have one somewhere. There was a fire code. Not that it mattered, because she\u2019d let herself get so distracted that Lucas had somehow managed to sneak up on her. Fucking vampire.</p> <p>\u201cLucas,\u201d she managed to say. She turned to face him, meeting his gaze head-on. Which was her second mistake of the evening. His eyes were more gold than hazel tonight, and they were filled with a mixture of hurt and reproach. The reproach she could have dealt with, but the hurt . . . Damn him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cObviously. Who\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend?\u201d she repeated, puzzled, then remembered the art lover. \u201cOh. That guy? I have no idea. Someone who doesn\u2019t understand color, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave her a smug smile, and she realized belatedly that she should have lied, should have let him know he wasn\u2019t the only handsome man in the world who was interested in her. And in the next breath, she cursed herself for the traitorous thought. What did she care if Lucas was jealous or not?</p><p>\u201cKathryn, a cuisle, you forgot to mention when you left my bed yesterday that you were departing immediately for Minneapolis. Isn\u2019t that odd?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn narrowed her eyes at him. No, it wasn\u2019t fucking odd, and he knew it. \u201cSomething came up,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cReally? What?\u201d he replied, his anger rising to match hers.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn caught her breath. The question struck her to the heart, and she could tell by the satisfied expression on his face that he knew it. She looked away from his accusing gaze and focused on the expensive art instead.</p><p>\u201cA big fan of cubism, are you?\u201d Lucas murmured in her ear.</p><p>He was standing far too close, but Kathryn refused to move and let him know it bothered her. \u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cProbably more than you do. I\u2019d wager your brother\u2019s the only artist in your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d she demanded, vaguely insulted, even though he was right.</p><p>\u201cBecause you are far too buttoned up to be an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not buttoned up,\u201d she snapped, still staring fixedly at the poor distorted women in the painting.</p><p>\u201cPlease. You\u2019re the very poster girl for buttoned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think I do. I also happen to know that you unbutton very nicely when motivated.\u201d</p><p>She shot a sideways glare in his direction. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly appropriate to discuss that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? But it\u2019s okay for you to discard me like a used condom and leave town without even saying good-bye?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s mouth dropped open in a gasp, and she turned to stare at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that!\u201d she hissed furiously, her gaze darting around to see if anyone was listening.</p><p>Lucas faced her, his eyes snapping gold sparks. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe you left me.\u201d</p><p>They were standing toe-to-toe, so close that all Kathryn would have to do was raise up on the balls of her feet, and their mouths would meet. She knew what he would taste like, knew the feel of his hard chest against her breasts, the span of his hands as they circled her hips while he drove himself between her thighs.</p><p>She drew back, shocked at her own thoughts. Thoughts she could see mirrored in Lucas\u2019s fierce gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your truck?\u201d he growled.</p><p>She swallowed on a dry throat. \u201cI took a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll take mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas\u2014\u201d she started, then stopped when he turned to stare at her as if daring her to protest.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t say anything, his expression softened. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded and didn\u2019t object when he took her hand and headed for the front door. Her fingers slipped into his as naturally as if they\u2019d been holding hands for years instead of a single day.</p><p>She was doomed.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>They barely spoke on the ride to Lucas\u2019s penthouse. Kathryn was painfully aware of Nicholas and Mason sitting in the front seat, and she didn\u2019t know what to say anyway. Lucas was still holding her hand, pressing it against his thigh, which struck her as terribly intimate. But then, what was more intimate than what they\u2019d done last night?</p><p>They crossed a bridge. She didn\u2019t know which one. There were so many in the Twin Cities; it seemed almost every street had a bridge. She saw a sign saying they were crossing the Mississippi River, which meant they were probably now in St. Paul. A few more blocks, and all three SUVs made the turn toward a tall glass and steel building that sat nearly on the riverfront. Parking was underground, with the entrance protected by a human guard, as well as a solid steel barrier. Someone in the front SUV clicked the remote, the barrier rose, and the garage swallowed them whole.</p><p>Lucas apparently had some pull with the owners\u2019 association, because they pulled into the three parking spaces closest to the elevator. As soon as they stopped, the other two SUVs emptied out, with vampires deploying throughout the garage. One of them punched the call button for the elevator, then stepped inside and checked it out before holding the door open and giving a nodding okay.</p><p>Lucas opened his door and stepped out into the garage without ever letting go of Kathryn\u2019s hand. She frowned, especially when she had to balance herself to get out of the SUV, but he didn\u2019t look at her, just shifted his grip and waited.</p><p>Kathryn sighed. He was going to be difficult about this. She just knew it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word until they were in his penthouse. It was on the top floor, of course, with dynamite views of the river on one side and what she assumed was the Capitol building on the other.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d she commented. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas still didn\u2019t say anything, although he did release her hand to head for the wet bar on the far wall. They were completely alone. Some of the vampires in his security contingent had stayed on the ground floor. Others had peeled off on the floor just below this one. Only Nicholas rode all the way to the top with them. He\u2019d checked out the entire condo, then gotten back into the elevator and presumably joined the others somewhere. Kathryn had studied his face covertly, looking for evidence of the ghastly wound he\u2019d been sporting only two days ago. There was nothing. He was completely healed, just as Lucas had told her he would be.</p><p>Lucas poured himself a drink at the bar and strolled back to where she was standing in front of the window overlooking the river.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Kathryn?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>She gave him a quick glance. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cLet me refresh your memory, then. You fucked my brains out night before last\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I had things to do. I drove all day yesterday to get here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and apparently you couldn\u2019t wait to get out of town. I talked to the motel manager. You must have gone directly there from my bed, then packed up and left with the sun barely above the horizon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you mean I fucked your brains out?\u201d she snapped, seizing on the one thing she could dispute, since everything else he\u2019d said was pretty damn accurate. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one in that bed, Lucas. Brains were fucked, and fun was had by all.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, he grinned. \u201cYou missed me, didn\u2019t you? Oh sure, the first couple of hours you were just focused on getting away, but then you started thinking, doubting . . . and you missed me. Did you dream about me?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cArrogant,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>She rounded on him. \u201cWhy are you here? Why Carmichael\u2019s gallery?\u201d</p><p>Lucas took a leisurely sip of his whiskey, eyeing her over the top of the crystal tumbler. When he lowered it, he said, \u201cI would think that\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . . conspiring with him,\u201d she accused. \u201cWith Carmichael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a cuisle, I\u2019ve been hunting.\u201d He turned and set down his drink on the marble inlay of a nearby table.</p><p>\u201cWhat does acushla mean, damn it! What are you calling me?\u201d She frowned as the rest of his words caught up to her. \u201cWait, what do you mean hunting. Hunting what?\u201d</p><p>Lucas wrapped his long fingers around her hip and tugged her up against his body. \u201cIt\u2019s not a what, it\u2019s a who. A certain FBI agent.\u201d He lowered his mouth to hers.</p><p>Kathryn intended to resist him. She wasn\u2019t going to kiss him, and she certainly wasn\u2019t going to grab him like a starving female and rub up against him wantonly. But that\u2019s what happened. One second she was determined to walk away, and the next they were inhaling each other\u2019s oxygen, kissing hungrily, biting and licking, her arms around his neck, his fingers twisted into her unbound hair, wrapping it around his fist and tilting her head back to plunder her mouth. And his other hand . . . her breath stalled in her lungs as his other hand crushed her hips against his so she could feel every inch of his erection, long and thick and as hard as stone against her belly.</p><p>Lucas felt a curl of satisfaction as Kathryn moaned a protest against his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d she began, even as she sucked his tongue into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he muttered back. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t stop. There was something about her, something that drove him mad, like a hot poker stuck straight into his fucking brain. He had to have her, desperately needed her beneath him, her hot pussy soaking wet as it sheathed his cock over and over again.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he swore softly and tugged her tight black dress up over her hips.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Kathryn protested weakly. \u201cThe window.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one-way,\u201d Lucas ground out and stripped the dress off over her head. He hissed when he saw what she was wearing underneath. Gone was the sensible white cotton bra, and in its place, pale silk and lace, barely cupping her full breasts, with a tiny matching lace triangle between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been shopping,\u201d he said, rubbing one hand over her firm and practically naked ass, while he caressed her breast with the other, thumbing her pink nipple until it poked out against its silky enclosure.</p><p>Kathryn was working determinedly on his belt buckle, ripping open the button to his pants and sliding the zipper down. He stiffened, in more ways than one, when she took him in her hand, her graceful and strong fingers gripping him tightly as she began to stroke up and down.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your fault,\u201d she complained. \u201cYou made me feel ugly with my white bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could never be ugly, a cuisle. I rather liked it, actually, though I do like this better. Now tell me,\u201d he tugged her long hair, forcing her to look up at him. \u201cWho did you think was going to see this beautiful and sexy new underwear?\u201d</p><p>She smiled innocently, but the gleam in her eyes gave her away. \u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>Lucas acknowledged the feeling. It wasn\u2019t something he felt very often, but she was right. He was jealous. He didn\u2019t know how long this obsession between them was going to last, but as long as it did, no one was touching her but him.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he lied. \u201cBut I\u2019m a possessive son of a bitch, Kathryn. As long as we\u2019re doing whatever this is, no one but me gets to see your underwear.\u201d He lowered his mouth to her neck and bit softly.</p><p>\u201cOh, ah,\u201d she said, her breath coming in pants. \u201cWhat if I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whatever she was going to say was lost in her gasp of surprise as he slipped two fingers between the wet folds of her sex. Jesus, she was hot. Slick and silky and so ready for him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he growled. He pushed her against the wall next to the window and ripped away her new lace panties, tossing them aside. Shoving his pants down and freeing his cock, he lifted her up and slid between her legs. She responded just as eagerly, wrapping her legs around his waist, her arms over his shoulders as their mouths met once again, kissing hungrily. Lucas sank his cock into her creamy center, feeling the warmth of her body surround him, her channel so tight, her trembling inner muscles caressing him as he thrust as deeply as he could. He paused for the space of a breath, holding perfectly still, feeling the pulsing of her pussy all around him, her heart pounding against his chest, her breath warm and moist along his cheek. They hung there for a long moment. And then he started moving, slowly at first, easing himself in and out, relishing the satin glide of her juices along his shaft. With a long, slow thrust, he plunged as deeply as he could go, feeling the touch of her cervix against the head of his cock. Kathryn made a noise deep in her throat and did a little ripple of her shoulder muscles from side to side, like a cat that\u2019s had a taste of catnip. One side of his mouth lifted in a grin. He liked that\u2014the idea that he was her catnip. Kathryn\u2019s eyes flashed open to meet his, and it was kindling to the flame. Suddenly, he had to have her, had to hear her screaming his name. He growled and began slamming in and out of her body, not going for finesse but for completion. He needed to spill inside her, to mark her in a way that no one else could.</p><p>Kathryn was making little noises with every thrust of his cock, gripping his shoulders and digging in with her fingers until he knew he\u2019d have bruises by the end of the night. It made him happy. He wanted to carry her mark, too. He lowered his mouth to her jugular, feeling the plump vein beneath his tongue, the rush of her blood, faster now as her heart began to dance in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cLucas, Lucas . . .\u201d she was moaning now, a lover\u2019s plea as he fucked her hard and deep.</p><p>\u201cKathryn,\u201d he whispered, and sank his fangs into her vein, pushing past the slight resistance of her soft skin, the thin wall of her pliant vein, and then her blood was rushing down his throat like dark honey, heated and smooth.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s legs scissored around his hips, her nails scraping his back. Her pussy clenched around him as the orgasm rolled through her body, her blunt teeth sinking into his shoulder as she screamed, her hips bucking against his until he felt his own climax building in his balls, roaring down his shaft and filling her completely.</p><p>Lucas retracted his fangs and licked up the last few delicious drops of her blood. He kissed the small puncture wounds, knowing they\u2019d be sealed in seconds and completely healed in hours. Kathryn hung onto him, her arms limp around his neck, her legs trembling in reaction to their explosive lovemaking.</p><p>He glanced down at himself and chuckled. He was still more than half dressed. His pants were around his ankles, and at some point his shirt had been ripped open, but he still wore his jacket, and his tie was still in place. Kathryn lifted her head at the sound of his laughter. She followed his gaze and started laughing, too. Until he saw a tear drip from her eye.</p><p>\u201cKathryn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it between us, Lucas? It\u2019s like . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpontaneous combustion,\u201d he supplied. \u201cFire and gun powder. I get near you, and I have to touch you. I touch you, and I have to be inside you. Not later, but right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she agreed. \u201cSort of. I mean, in my head, I\u2019m saying no thanks and walking away, and the next thing I know I\u2019m all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s all your fault, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires are predators, Kathryn. When you run, my instinct is to run after you, and I can run a hell of a lot faster. So if you\u2019d just throw yourself at me first thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams, asshole,\u201d she snapped, rapping her knuckles on the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d Lucas said, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some muscles, woman. And speaking of muscles . . .\u201d He palmed her butt with both hands, lifting her higher. Kathryn\u2019s eyes widened as if just realizing they were standing the way they\u2019d ended, with him buried between her lovely, long legs which were still wrapped around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her face heated. \u201cOh, my God. This is what you do. Look at me! I\u2019m up against a wall! Naked! And in full view of whoever happens by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. The glass is one-way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Put me down, you big oaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOaf she says now. That\u2019s not what you called me when you were creaming all over me a moment ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just say things like . . . I thought we agreed this attraction between us was unhealthy. You know, the whole fire and gunpowder thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never agreed to any such thing. It is definitely explosive, however. A fast-burning flame. And the best way to deal with that is to let it burn out naturally. We need to spend several days having wild sex in every way imaginable. You know, to get rid of this unhealthy impulse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would think that. Besides, we tried that the other night as I recall. It obviously didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPfft. That was nothing, my sweet. A flame this hot needs more than a single night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to get me back into your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you in my bed; I already have you up against my wall.\u201d</p><p>She blushed again. He loved making her blush.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Are you not up against my wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d she began sternly, then gasped as he began moving inside her, taking advantage of the moisture from her recent orgasm which had left her pussy warm and creamy and perfectly lubricated.</p><p>\u201cShall we set fire to the wall, a cuisle, or would you rather use the bed? It\u2019s a very nice bed.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn didn\u2019t answer right away. Her eyes were closed, her expression dreamy as he glided slowly in and out of her sexy body. She licked her lips slowly, and it was Lucas\u2019s turn to groan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me here, Kathryn. If you want to move to the bed, tell me now, or it\u2019s going to be too late.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open. \u201cBed,\u201d she managed.</p><p>Cursing the undignified position he found himself in\u2014only Kathryn could have driven him so insanely hungry so quickly that he left his shoes on, his pants around his ankles\u2014he nonetheless cowboyed up and delivered. Unwilling to pull away from Kathryn\u2019s welcoming heat, he cupped her ass with his hands, holding her in place as he toed off his shoes, then stepped out of his slacks, leaving them in a pile on the floor. Kathryn\u2019s legs tightened around him as he carried her to the bedroom, their mouths feeding on each other as if they hadn\u2019t just brought each other to mutually screaming orgasms moments earlier. She was right about one thing. This attraction between them was hotter than any he\u2019d experienced in his long life. And he could see it ending only one of two ways\u2014either they\u2019d stick for a while, maybe a very long while, although he wasn\u2019t willing to go too far down that path, even in his thoughts. Or they\u2019d burn out quickly and end up hating each other.</p><p>Either way, he thought, as he laid her on the bed and proceeded to strip off his jacket, shirt and tie while still managing to keep his cock buried inside her, he intended to have her in his bed every night as long as it lasted.</p> <p>Kathryn scraped her fingers through the fine, black hair on Lucas\u2019s chest. Lucas\u2019s hard, muscular, gorgeous chest. Why couldn\u2019t he have been a troll instead of a god? She\u2019d have been in and out of South Dakota, no looking back, eyes straight ahead and looking for her brother, and then back to Quantico. Instead, she was all twisted up in vampires and secrets and one gorgeous lover. And, sure, she was making some headway in finding Daniel, but she was losing her heart in the process. She sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, stop it,\u201d Lucas grumbled, his deep voice sated and sluggish.</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m thinking anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sighed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI breathed.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIf I said the sky was blue, you\u2019d say it was green. Though, I haven\u2019t seen the daylight sky in so long, it might well be green by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sky is still blue. And I\u2019m not that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, you are. But I lo . . . can\u2019t keep my hands off you anyway.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn heard the catch in his sentence and wondered what he\u2019d been about to say. She thought about possibilities and found herself smiling goofily. She hit the brakes hard on that thought. Time to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cSo, how old are you?\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI mean, you told me the other day that only lovers could ask that question, but I\u2019m pretty sure I qualify now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, fess up, old man. How old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born in Kildare, Ireland in 1785.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn blinked. \u201cBut that makes you,\u201d she did some quick math in her head, but Lucas beat her to it.</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred and twenty-seven years old, give or take a month. I was born in winter, that\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn sat up, staring at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou must have had some idea,\u201d he said, gazing back at her calmly.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, well, yeah. But . . . I don\u2019t think anybody, at least not anybody in authority, knows you\u2019re that old. I mean . . look at you! I know twenty-year-olds who don\u2019t look this good! Are all of you that old?\u201d She knew she was rambling, but couldn\u2019t stop herself.</p><p>Lucas only grinned. \u201cYou think I look good?\u201d</p><p>Trust him to pick out the one flattering thing she\u2019d said. \u201cYou have a mirror,\u201d she said dismissively. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you spend plenty of time in front of it, too. So don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he replied, sounding completely put upon. \u201cNo, not every vampire is the same age as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you never serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Kathryn. I can be deadly serious when the situation calls for it. But lying in bed, naked, with a beautiful woman I\u2019ve just fucked until she screamed my name\u2014\u201d He laughed when Kathryn gave him a threatening glare. \u201c\u2014is not normally a time that calls for solemnity. However. Just for you, a cuisle.\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself up on the pillows and put his hands behind his head. \u201cThere are many vampires younger than I am, and a very few who are much, much older. The important thing to remember when dealing with vampires, Kathryn, is that age and power are not necessarily the same thing. I\u2019m two hundred and twenty-seven, and that seems old. But I have several vampires in my territory who are far older than that, and they are sworn to my service because I protect them, not the other way around. If one of them were to challenge me, he\u2019d be dead before he got the words out. That\u2019s how it works. Humans speak of leaders holding the lives of their followers in their hands, but with vampires, it is quite literally true. My vampires have blood in their veins and air in their lungs because I make it possible.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn studied this new, serious Lucas. If all one saw was the public face, the handsome playboy charming his way through a crowd, it would be easy to underestimate Lucas Donlon. Fatally easy.</p><p>\u201cHow does it happen?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He gave her a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cHow does someone become a vampire? Is it like the books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that would depend on which book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. How did you become a vampire, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Now that\u2019s a long story.\u201d He reached out a well-muscled arm and flicked the tip of one of her nipples. \u201cIf you come back here,\u201d he added, dropping his arm to her waist and tugging her toward him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn gave a mock scowl and cupped her breast protectively, mostly for effect since Lucas never did anything that hurt her, not even in the deepest throes of their passion.</p><p>Lucas responded by leaning forward and taking the offended nipple in his mouth, kissing it gently and swirling his tongue over and around in a soothing caress.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Kathryn could barely breathe. Some emotion she\u2019d never felt before was squeezing her chest like a straitjacket. She stroked her fingers through his unruly hair, then nodded wordlessly, and let him tug her down into his arms. \u201cTell me the story,\u201d she whispered, knowing, even as she asked, that she was playing with fire, that with every word that passed his sensuous lips, she\u2019d be sucked deeper into the flame that was Lucas Donlon.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>1801, London, England</p><p>Lucas Donlon sidled through the crowds in the busy square, his practiced eye searching for the next mark, the next fool. That\u2019s what they all were. Fools. Clustered mindlessly around the opera house forecourt, without the sense God gave a mongrel dog. At least a dog was smart enough to guard its treasure, even if it was only a tasty bone.</p><p>He scrambled up to the roof of a nearby building and crouched low, smiling privately at the image of himself as a mongrel dog among the sheep below. He\u2019d always wanted a dog, but when his mam had been alive, she hadn\u2019t wanted the mess, and once she\u2019d died . . . well, he\u2019d had enough trouble keeping himself fed, much less a dog. And there was Dublin\u2019s Constabulary to contend with. They\u2019d tried more than once to throw him into one of those priest-run prisons for wayward boys. He\u2019d preferred to take his chances on the streets. At least there he was free\u2014free to keep the few coppers he managed to earn running errands for the whores who\u2019d been his dead mother\u2019s companions at the end of her life. Free to steal whatever else he could get his hands on.</p><p>Inevitably, he\u2019d run afoul of the Constabulary one too many times and been forced to leave Ireland behind. And not without a few looks back, either. Ireland was his home, but he\u2019d promised himself that he\u2019d return someday when he was a rich man. He\u2019d be wearing fine clothes and riding a beautiful horse like those his grandfather had owned. He only hoped that heartless old man was there to witness it.</p><p>Lucas pushed aside thoughts of the grandfather who\u2019d left him and his mother to starve on the streets. The old man was An Tiarna of his own lands. His servants lived better than what he\u2019d abandoned his own flesh and blood to endure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas surveyed the milling crowd. He was still as thin as ever\u2014his meals weren\u2019t regular enough for anything else\u2014but at sixteen he was too tall to slip easily through the crowd as he\u2019d once done, plucking purses at will. He had to choose his target more carefully these days, had to move decisively, make the grab and get away with no one the wiser. Because he was too old for a boys\u2019 home. If he was caught now, it would be prison for him, and for a very long time, too.</p><p>His eye fell on a tall man, black-haired like Lucas himself, but with eyes just as black as his hair. He stood out even in this fancy gathering, supremely arrogant in an arrogant crowd. The man was dressed finely, his breeches clean and tucked into shining, knee-high leather boots. His gleaming white waistcoat was richly embroidered, and his coat was the finest wool, expertly tailored to fit such a big man. The only flaw in this sartorial splendor was the absence of a hat, as though he disdained the need to hide or shelter beneath its brim. All of that said money and position to Lucas\u2019s well-trained eye. Unfortunately, his well-trained brain was telling him there was something not right about this one. He didn\u2019t have the look of the other fools, with their eyes everywhere but where they should be. Lucas\u2019s experience was telling him that not much slipped by this dark-eyed stranger.</p><p>The man called something over the heads of the crowd, and Lucas turned to look. Another aristocrat, nearly as tall as the dark one, but pale instead, with hair as red as any Lucas had seen on the streets of Dublin. Lucas strained to hear what was said, but they were speaking a strange tongue, and he couldn\u2019t understand a single word. The pale man responded in the same language.</p> <p>Foreigners, then. Lucas grinned. What a feat it would be to steal a purse from this one. None of his thieving friends in the rickety hovel they called their own had ever managed such a grab. It was risky, but he was certain the purse would contain enough coins to make it worthwhile.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s gaze followed his new target, observing the way the foreigner moved among the crowd, the way his clothes shifted around his purse, and the purse itself. Well-crafted leather, but with a narrow strap that would fall easily to the small, sharp knife Lucas carried up his sleeve. He studied the mark longer than he normally would have. With most of his marks, he could simply slip up behind them, dip a hand into a satchel or slice a strap, and be gone before the fool even knew he\u2019d been there.</p><p>But when the purse was rich enough, one had to be extra cautious. Such people frequently had companions or even guards to be wary of. It paid to take a few moments and observe.</p><p>With this man, this tall, dark foreigner, he\u2019d take those few moments and more.</p><p>Lucas finally made his move when the bells sounded, and the mingling gentry began shuffling toward the front doors of the opera house. He swiftly descended from the roof and hung back in the alley, scanning the crowd one last time, checking the location of the various watchmen who always lingered nearby. Once set upon his course, however, he didn\u2019t hesitate. He moved through the crowd with the ease of long experience, dropped the knife into his hand, strolled up to the mark and slid the knife beneath the strap of the foreigner\u2019s purse. A flick of his wrist and . . .</p> <p>Long fingers curled around his wrist with surprising strength. Lucas raised his eyes in shock and met the cold, black gaze of the dark man. The man smiled, and it chilled Lucas to the bone.</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s mine,\u201d the man said, his voice deep, the English words heavily accented.</p><p>Lucas clenched his jaw and stood to his full height, straightening his shoulders. If he was going to go down, he\u2019d do it with a man\u2019s dignity.</p><p>The dark man\u2019s expression warmed fractionally. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for a boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no boy,\u201d Lucas spat back at him.</p><p>The man laughed. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. But you\u2019ll do anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how I met Raphael,\u201d Lucas said, running a hand up and down Kathryn\u2019s arm.</p><p>She waited for him to continue, frowning when he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rest of the story?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the vampire part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampire part?\u201d he repeated, laughing.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d She pinched his stomach, or tried to. Lucas\u2019s washboard abs didn\u2019t leave much to pinch. \u201cI want to know how he turned you into a vampire. And when. Because you don\u2019t look sixteen years old, bud. I don\u2019t sleep with babies, no matter how old they really are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far you haven\u2019t slept with me, either,\u201d he murmured, nuzzling her jaw while one hand snuck up to cup her breast.</p> <p>Kathryn turned into his embrace, unable to help herself. Every time he touched her, her body responded, as if it was programmed into her genes. She curved one leg around his thigh and began stroking herself along his hip.</p><p>Lucas made a rumbling sound deep in his chest and bent to suck gently on her neck. Kathryn shivered. She put her lips next to his ear and whispered, \u201cTell me when you became a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Lucas slapped her ass playfully and pulled away from her to lie back on the pillows. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m curious. How does it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that. If you ever become a vampire, you\u2019ll find out. If not\u2014\u201d He tugged a length of her hair. \u201c\u2014you won\u2019t. Which, as far as I\u2019m concerned, means you\u2019ll never know. I like you just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoilsport. I hate secrets.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed again. \u201cWe all have them, a cuisle. Even you.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn scowled at the Irish endearment. He never had told her what it meant, but she didn\u2019t want to derail their current conversation to ask, so she let it slide.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least tell me what happened after that night,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>Lucas gave a dismissive shrug. \u201cRaphael needed someone to be his daytime eyes and ears. It wasn\u2019t like now, with everything done on the Internet and all sorts of places open twenty-four hours a day. Someone had to deal with the hundred and one things necessary to running a household, things that needed doing during the day. Even vampires need clothing and supplies, and there were social necessities, mail and such. Invitations to events like the opera. Raphael and his people weren\u2019t high profile, but they travelled in very ritzy circles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were his errand boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old do I look to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-seven,\u201d Kathryn said immediately.</p><p>\u201cClose enough. After a few years, Raphael decided to leave Europe. I went with him, of course. There was nothing left for me in England, or Ireland, either. And my life with Raphael had been better than anything I\u2019d known before that. For the first time, I wasn\u2019t hungry every night. I had a clean, safe place to sleep and decent clothes to wear. So, I booked ship passage for all of us and dealt with the captain and crew, safeguarding the vampires as they slept, and arranging quiet encounters at night so the vampires could feed discreetly. Once we arrived in America, Raphael gave me a choice. I chose to become what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019d chosen otherwise? What would he have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d have kept me on as his daylight guard, or given me enough money to set myself up doing whatever else I decided. Loyalty is important to him.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn studied him for a moment, surprised by the honest emotion she heard in his voice when he talked about Raphael.</p><p>\u201cYou love him.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s my Sire. That\u2019s the most important relationship any vampire has, unless he takes a mate. Even then, the two\u2014Sire and mate\u2014are equally significant to him. But more than that, Raphael was the first person, other than my mother, who ever treated me like I was worth something. I would give my life for his without hesitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give your life away.\u201d She looked up and held his gaze so he\u2019d know she was serious, but then, feeling the need to take a step back, she added, \u201cI\u2019m using it right now.\u201d</p><p>Lucas regarded her intently. A slow smile curved his lips, and he said, \u201cNo promises. But if you\u2019re nice to me, I\u2019ll do the best I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am nice to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant . . . right now.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn felt something hard brush against her hip. \u201cOh, that,\u201d she said playfully. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can come up with something nice for that.\u201d</p><p>Daniel woke to the sound of voices. He lay still, afraid to move, not wanting whoever it was to hear him and stop talking. There\u2019d never been anyone but his kidnapper before. No one for either of them to talk to but each other. But now . . . yes, that was definitely a woman\u2019s voice.</p><p>His breath caught as he hoped, briefly, that it was Kathryn, that she\u2019d found him, and the FBI was going to break in with guns blazing. Or at least with badges flashing since it didn\u2019t sound like there was much shooting going on out there. But it wasn\u2019t Kathryn. Her voice was much huskier than this woman\u2019s, sexier, or so his friends told him. She was his sister. He didn\u2019t want to think about whether her voice or anything else about her was sexy.</p><p>The woman out there, whoever she was, was agitated, her voice rising in volume and emotion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, that FBI bitch is cozying up to Lucas, and that\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just jealous. You\u2019ve always had a thing for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d the woman snapped. \u201cBesides, they left together. How\u2019s that for proof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d his kidnapper muttered. \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to end this. You never told me his sister was a fucking FBI agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell was I supposed to know something like that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019d hit up his business agent right away, like we discussed, it wouldn\u2019t matter. We\u2019d have the ransom, and this whole thing would be over already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to this than money, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me there\u2019s not! Especially now that Lucas is involved. I\u2019m not risking my life so you can get your rocks off with your boyfriend in there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend. He\u2019s an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s a rich artist, and I\u2019m sending the ransom demand before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d the man said immediately. \u201cI mean, not yet. I need to make a phone call later tonight. Then we\u2019ll work something out.\u201d</p><p>Daniel grinned. So Kathryn was looking for him. He\u2019d known she wouldn\u2019t give up easily. A door slammed outside the room. It was a little distant, like down a long hallway, and the noise usually meant his captor was leaving for a while. In this case, he thought it was probably the woman leaving, but had the man gone with her? But no, a key turned in the door lock, so someone was still here. He steadied his breathing, feigning sleep. It was a skill he\u2019d perfected over his weeks of captivity, and he was quite good at it. For some reason, the man was always reluctant to wake him. Maybe he thought an artist needed his sleep or some crap. Daniel didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t care. If it kept his admirer away from him, it was a good thing.</p><p>The door opened slowly. Daniel could feel him standing there, staring at him, but he was used to it and didn\u2019t move. A moment later, the door closed, but he remained still. His captor tested him sometimes, popping the door open quickly, trying to catch him. It had worked the first time he\u2019d tried it, but not since then, because Daniel wasn\u2019t a fucking idiot. Although he was beginning to think his kidnapper might not be playing with a full deck.</p> <p>The lock clicked solidly into place, and footsteps moved away. The distant door slammed, and Daniel was alone once again.</p><p>Lucas felt the bed shift as Kathryn left. He cracked his eyes open and saw her gathering her clothes, sneaking looks over her shoulder. Did she really know so little about vampires? He didn\u2019t sleep, not the way humans did. Not at night, anyway. And his daytime sleep was more like unconsciousness, at least physically. His mind could be active, but his body would refuse to cooperate.</p><p>Kathryn tiptoed out of the bedroom while Lucas fumed. This was getting to be a habit, and one he didn\u2019t appreciate in a lover. He followed silently, stepping into the living room as she pulled the black dress over her head.</p><p>\u201cKathryn.\u201d</p><p>She jumped at the sound of his voice, spinning around and almost falling as she struggled to get the dress pulled down far enough that she could see him. She would have fallen if he hadn\u2019t caught her.</p><p>She slapped away his hands, giving him an angry look. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone of this is funny,\u201d he snapped back at her. \u201cI thought we were past the sneaking-out phase of our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelationship? Is that you call this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what the hell do you call it?\u201d</p><p>She took a step forward and got up in his face. \u201cWe\u2019re having sex. And, frankly, I shouldn\u2019t even be doing that. I\u2019m supposed to be looking for my brother, not rolling around in bed with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are looking for your brother, but even you can\u2019t do it twenty-four hours a damn day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to find Alex Carmichael, and I\u2019m beginning to think no one wants me to talk to him, including you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Lucas snarled. \u201cNews flash, Agent Hunter. I\u2019ve had my people looking for him ever since you told me he left with your brother. I want him found just as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn matched his angry stare at first, then seemed to deflate as she stepped back and sank onto the couch. \u201cI need to find Alex, Lucas.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas crouched in front of her and took her hands. \u201cI know, a cuisle. And we will. He can\u2019t hide forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he\u2019s left town? You said he had a different master. Will he go to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. Although Alex set himself up in Minneapolis for a reason. I think he prefers living here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand any of this. I don\u2019t understand how all of you can live in this country and not be in the system. There are no prints on file for him anywhere. He owns a business, but there are no permits, no ownership documents. The building where his gallery\u2019s located is owned by a corporation that\u2019s nested so deeply, it would take months for me to track it back to the real owner. If this was an official investigation, I could put some techs on it, but it\u2019s just me, and I can\u2019t find him.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI need to find him, Lucas.\u201d A tear rolled down her cheek, and she froze, immediately turning her head and hiding behind her hair. No emotion, no feelings. Not for his Kathryn.</p><p>Lucas sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve put feelers out everywhere I can think of. And Alex knows me. He\u2019ll call as soon as he gets word that I\u2019m looking for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you all could just\u2014\u201d She sighed impatiently and waved a hand in the air. \u201cYou know, telepathy, talk mind to mind.\u201d</p><p>Lucas fought back a smile, knowing she wouldn\u2019t appreciate it. Not in her current state. \u201cIf Alex was my child . . . a vampire I had turned myself,\u201d he added when she gave him a puzzled look. \u201cIf he was one of mine, I could contact him without needing a telephone, so to speak, but he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stood abruptly, shoving her hair back. She looked around the room until she spotted her purse, then went over and started pulling things out. Her gun. He hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d brought one along, although if he\u2019d given it a thought, he\u2019d have smelled the damn thing. Next came her FBI badge in its small, black portfolio, and finally, a black scrunchy, which was apparently what she was looking for. She finger-combed her hair into a high ponytail and secured it with the scrunchy. Lucas had a few of those himself. He\u2019d been known to go months between haircuts, until his hair irritated him enough that he broke down and got it cut again.</p><p>Kathryn turned to face him from across the room, her cheeks scrubbed free of tears. \u201cIt must be getting late for you,\u201d she said, not looking at him.</p><p>Lucas studied her, wondering what event in her life had caused her to withdraw so completely into herself. Wondering if he\u2019d ever find out.</p><p>\u201cThe sun will rise in . . . forty-five minutes, give or take a minute,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>She looked at him then, her eyes wide with surprise. \u201cYou can tell that precisely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen your life depends on it, you learn.\u201d</p><p>He could see she was intrigued. Perhaps that was the way to Kathryn\u2019s heart. Give her a mystery to solve. Assuming he wanted to find her heart at all. Maybe he\u2019d be better off taking a page from her playbook. A few nights of wild sex, then good-bye, nice fucking you.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do today?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She bit her full lower lip, considering. Lucas watched avidly, thinking how much he\u2019d like to be the one doing the biting. He almost missed what she was saying when she finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything I can do during the day. The only lead I have right now is Alex Carmichael.\u201d</p><p>Lucas thought about what might happen if Kathryn went looking for a vampire who didn\u2019t want to be found. Even one as relatively harmless as Alex.</p><p>\u201cPromise you won\u2019t go looking for him without me, Kathryn. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p><p>She drew a breath, and he could tell she was going to brush him off just like she\u2019d done every other time. But then something changed her mind.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said unexpectedly. \u201cCall me when you\u2019re ready to go tonight.\u201d</p><p>She turned away, but Lucas used his vampire speed to cross the few feet between them, snaking an arm around her waist before she even saw him move. Her eyes widened in shock, but her pupils flared with desire as he tightened his hold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready now, a cuisle.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s face heated as Lucas flattened his hand over her perfect ass, pressing her against his erection.</p><p>\u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d she began, but her words were cut off as Lucas\u2019s house phone rang. He frowned. He wasn\u2019t expecting any calls, and certainly not this close to sunrise.</p><p>\u201cSaved by the bell,\u201d he murmured, then gave her a quick, hard kiss and strode over to the bar to pick up the phone, checking the caller ID as he did so. His eyebrows shot up, and he stilled, listening to Kathryn\u2019s footsteps as she walked into the bathroom and closed the door.</p><p>He hit the Talk button. \u201cAlex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Alex Carmichael said breathlessly. \u201cI don\u2019t have long. I need to meet with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, my lord,\u201d he said, still breathing hard. \u201cThere\u2019s no time. Can you meet me tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. At the gallery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alex said instantly. \u201cToo many ears. I have a property in Saint Louis Park, an old warehouse. It\u2019s empty, abandoned. I bought it on spec, but\u2014 Forgive me, my lord. You don\u2019t care about that. The point is, it\u2019s empty. No one will look for us there. I can send you the address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cText it,\u201d Lucas told him, and gave him Nick\u2019s business cell number. \u201cHow far is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few miles, my lord. Fifteen minutes\u2019 drive from Minneapolis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours after sunset, then. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d Alex said fervently. \u201cThank you.\u201d And then he was gone.</p><p>Lucas disconnected with a frown, then immediately called Nick.</p><p>\u201cSire?\u201d Nick answered, sounding just as surprised as Lucas had been when Alex called.</p><p>\u201cAlex Carmichael just called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible\u2014 Which line?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe house phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did he get that number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question. Better question . . . why does he want to meet me?\u201d He heard the bathroom door open behind him, heard Kathryn\u2019s high heels tapping across the hardwood floor.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cNo, neither do I. Something\u2019s not right.

Lucas. Please. You like Kathryn, and you\u2019d like to help her. I get that. But it\u2019s not worth risking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a debate, Nick. You\u2019ll be getting a text with the address. An old warehouse in Saint Louis Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right outside the city,\u201d Nick said unhappily. \u201cHe obviously knows you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Francoise was on the phone with him the moment we drove away from the gallery.\u201d Lucas felt more than heard Kathryn\u2019s attention spike at the mention of Alex\u2019s gallery manager. He turned around slowly and found her staring at him, her purse in one hand, weapon and badge once again safely stowed inside.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not planning on going alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Nick. You and Mason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a team, my lord. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Mason, Nick,\u201d he repeated. \u201cHe\u2019s already terrified. I don\u2019t want to scare him away.\u201d</p><p>Nick groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me here, Sire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring Agent Hunter along for good measure, how\u2019s that? She\u2019s armed and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn narrowed her eyes at him, and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen tell me what time tomorrow night, and we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex and I agreed on two hours after sunset, but let\u2019s get there a half hour earlier than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled at the glum resignation in his lieutenant\u2019s voice as he hung up. Kathryn was on him an instant later.</p><p>\u201cWhom are we meeting?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Lucas gazed down at her beautiful face, her lips still swollen from his kisses, her blue eyes bright with excitement. And all he wanted to do was drag her back to his bed. She stared back at him and must have read the desire in his gaze, because her cheeks heated, and her heart began to race. She licked her lips, and Lucas followed the quick movement of her pink tongue.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2014\u201d she repeated, then had to swallow when her voice came out raspy and dry. \u201cWhom are we meeting, Lucas?\u201d she said, trying again.</p><p>\u201cAlex Carmichael,\u201d Lucas provided, cupping her jaw in his hand and lowering his mouth to hers for a lingering kiss. It was all he had time for. The sun was very nearly above the horizon. Not that Kathryn would be interested in sex anyway. Not once she\u2019d heard Alex\u2019s name.</p><p>She grabbed his hand, squeezing his fingers as she pulled away from their kiss. \u201cCarmichael? Does he have Daniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mention your brother,\u201d Lucas said, sighing in resignation, \u201cand I think he would have if he had him. But we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d she swore. \u201cWait. He gave you the address. Give it to me, and I\u2019ll check it out today. If Daniel\u2019s there, I can grab him. If not, no harm, right?\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave her a patient look. \u201cThe location is an abandoned warehouse. It\u2019s doubtful Alex is there now. If he is, the building will be secure enough that you won\u2019t be able to do anything but stare at it from the outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that. Give me the address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that, and, no, I won\u2019t give you the address, because if you storm in there without knowing what you\u2019re doing, someone might end up dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean your buddy Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I meant you. But, yes, Alex might also be a casualty. A vampire at rest is completely defenseless. I won\u2019t help you with that.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her jaw flexing with tension. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Daniel is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll play it your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we will. You can let yourself out.\u201d He strode toward the bedroom, miffed at her single-minded obsession with her brother.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she called. \u201cWhat time\u2014\u201d She yelped in surprise as the automatic steel shutters rolled over the windows and locked with a loud thunking noise.</p><p>\u201cBe here at sunset,\u201d he said over his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve got three minutes, or you\u2019ll be locked in here until then.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn shot a quick glance at the shuttered windows, then back at him. She grabbed her purse and coat, then surprised him by racing over to give him a quick kiss before running for the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at sunset,\u201d she called as she hurried out of the penthouse.</p><p>Lucas gazed after her in bemusement. Maybe there was hope for her yet. He pressed a button on the security control panel for the penthouse, overriding the lockout on the elevator. A second button push, and a screen deployed, showing him Kathryn in the elevator, then switching to the lobby as she exited the building. She was on her cell phone, presumably calling a cab. She shouldn\u2019t have a problem this early in the day.</p><p>He leaned heavily against the wall as he entered a code to remove the override. The system reasserted itself immediately, bringing the elevator back to the penthouse level and locking it there, while securing both the elevator door and the front door to the suite with the same steel shutters that covered the windows.</p><p>Lucas knew the moment the sun topped the horizon. It was a flame inside his head, a thousand pound weight on his chest as he fell onto the bed. His last thought before the sun stole his awareness was that Klemens was using Carmichael as bait. That this was payback for the death of his vampires in the Rockford house.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced at Nicholas, not at all surprised by his lieutenant\u2019s pronouncement. \u201cOf course, you don\u2019t,\u201d he commented, then turned his attention back to the decrepit warehouse where Alex had set the meet. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy about it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we know who or what\u2019s waiting in there?\u201d Nick insisted.</p><p>Kathryn made an impatient noise. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know if we stand out here all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Lucas said, giving her an apologetic look, \u201cI can tell you right now who\u2019s in there. And that\u2019s Alex Carmichael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell,\u201d she said faintly, and then her expression fell. \u201cOnly Carmichael?\u201d she said, disappointment dragging on every syllable.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, Kathryn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou warned me,\u201d she said resignedly. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas ran a comforting hand down her arm. \u201cYour brother\u2019s not there, but that doesn\u2019t mean Carmichael doesn\u2019t know where he is. He asked to meet us for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d Lucas said, reaching a decision.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathryn and I will go in alone. You and Mason\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord! Carmichael belongs to Klemens. What if it\u2019s a trap?\u201d Nick demanded, echoing Lucas\u2019s own concerns.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I want you and Mason out here. There is no one in that building, human or vampire, except for Alex. And I think I can handle him on my own. But if it\u2019s a trap, if Klemens plans to send a force in after us . . . then I need you out here, keeping watch and ready to call in the troops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could call them now, my lord. They\u2019re geared up and waiting for the word.\u201d</p><p>Lucas considered it. This entire setup was damn odd. But Carmichael was a decent sort who had always chafed under Klemens\u2019s rule. He\u2019d never had the courage to leave the other vampire lord\u2019s territory, but he\u2019d spent much of his time in Minneapolis, nonetheless.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in there, Nick. Come on, Kathryn,\u201d he said, holding out a hand, \u201clet\u2019s see what Alex has to tell us.\u201d</p><p>She looked at his hand, then drew her Glock instead. \u201cI\u2019m with Nick on this one,\u201d she said grimly. \u201cI don\u2019t know who this guy Klemens is, but there\u2019s something not right about this meet.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas gave Lucas a meaningful look, which Lucas ignored. \u201cAs you will, a cuisle,\u201d he said to Kathryn. \u201cBut, let\u2019s go see.\u201d</p><p>The building was old and deeply weathered. The brick was pitted, the mortar missing in chunks big enough that an observer could have peeked inside if one had been so foolish as to put an eye up to the small holes presented. Lucas wasn\u2019t that foolish. He strode up to the sheet metal-plated front door and gave the handle a tentative yank. It was unlocked. Clearly Carmichael was expecting them.</p><p>The door opened outward. He checked to make sure Kathryn was ready, then pulled open the door and went in ahead of her. He might not think there was a trap waiting for them, but he wasn\u2019t going to bet Kathryn\u2019s life on it. He was far less destructible than his human lover.</p><p>Dirt and grit scraped underfoot as they crossed what had been a small reception area. There was an ancient metal desk in one corner and what he assumed were the remains of a chair in pieces behind it. Wires, both phone and electrical, poked out of the walls, and patches of carpet spotted the concrete floor like a brown fungus.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Kathryn commented.</p><p>\u201cAlex did say it was abandoned.\u201d</p><p>A second door stood open to the interior. Lucas crossed over to it and saw that the rest of the building had been a manufacturing facility of some sort. There was a central open area with heavy mountings still bolted to the floor, although the equipment had been removed for the most part. What bits remained were unrecognizable, at least to Lucas. Around all four sides was an open mezzanine with three separate floors, each facing out onto the manufacturing area. Offices lined the mezzanine walls, some with doors still closed, others gaping open. Whatever glass had been in either the doors or the open frames next to them was long gone and littered the floor underfoot. A metal railing that had once provided a barrier between the mezzanine levels and the open factory was rusted away with big gaps where it had fallen, or been ripped, away completely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas scanned the area, his senses wide open. His gaze fell on the industrial-sized elevator, which appeared to be in relatively good shape. Alex was clearly maintaining it for his own use, despite the ramshackle state of the rest of the building.</p><p>The double doors slid open a moment later, and Alex himself stepped out.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, my lord. I meant to be waiting here when you arrived.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas dipped his head briefly in acknowledgement. \u201cAlex, this is Special Agent Kathryn Hunter, FBI. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>Alex smiled faintly. \u201cThe infamous Agent Hunter. You\u2019ve got Francoise in quite a tizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why. Unless one of you has something to hide,\u201d Kathryn responded coolly.</p><p>\u201cI admire Daniel\u2019s work a great deal, Agent Hunter. But regrettably, he is not with me.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn remained silent, but Lucas could feel her tension and distrust like a buzz saw along his nerves.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are we here, Alex?\u201d he asked, wanting to get this over with.</p><p>\u201cPlease, my lord,\u201d he said, gesturing at the elevator. \u201cWhat I have to say is best said in private. I have a very pleasant apartment of sorts downstairs, a place for when I need to get away. No one knows about it, but me. And now you, of course.\u201d</p><p>Lucas studied the other vampire, looking for deception. If Alex tried to tell an outright lie, Lucas would know, but beyond that, it was difficult to say. Alex didn\u2019t belong to him. Still, he was in Lucas\u2019s territory, and he had to know that Kathryn, at least, didn\u2019t believe a word he was saying. Nonetheless, he seemed perfectly relaxed. Maybe it was only because he was in his private lair, someplace he felt secure. Or maybe he had nothing to hide.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Lucas agreed. \u201cIs there light enough for Kathryn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord. I frequently work down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathryn?\u201d Lucas said, glancing at her in question.</p> <p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d She\u2019d re-holstered her sidearm, but Lucas noticed she hadn\u2019t replaced the safety strap, and her hand rested lightly on the butt of the weapon.</p><p>\u201cLead the way, Alex,\u201d Lucas said, gesturing toward the open elevator.</p><p>The elevator\u2019s descent was smooth. Despite the disreputable state of the building, the vamp had clearly maintained the elevator in good condition, which made sense if he came here often to sleep in the basement. The lack of security was surprising, but perhaps there was more to it than what Lucas could see. At a minimum, Alex could probably lock down the elevator and make the lower level inaccessible during the daylight hours.</p><p>Lucas glanced up at the floor numbers over the elevator door and frowned abruptly. They had just passed B1 and were descending to B2. \u201cThere\u2019s a subbasement?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>Alex nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I bought this building. No one seemed to know what the original owners stored down here, but I assume it benefited from the cool conditions. I had the entire site tested for contaminants just to be safe, but there was nothing here.\u201d</p><p>Lucas accepted the explanation, but couldn\u2019t shake a growing bad feeling about this little adventure. Clearly, Kathryn was having the same reservations, because she edged out to one side and a half step behind him as the elevator slowed. Defensive tactics 101. Never give your enemy a concentrated target.</p><p>Before the doors to the elevator opened, Lucas sent his power sweeping outward, searching for enemies. Alex surely felt the brush of it, but he didn\u2019t offer a protest of any kind, not even an assurance that it wasn\u2019t necessary. And it suddenly occurred to Lucas what was bothering him about this setup. It was Alex himself. No vampire liked to have his lair invaded, and especially not by a vampire as powerful as Lucas, who was also the sworn enemy of Alex\u2019s master. But it wasn\u2019t that Alex was too nervous, it was that he was too calm.</p><p>Outwardly, Lucas gave away nothing, but privately he cursed his own arrogance and let his emotions leak to Nicholas, who was waiting upstairs with Mason. If the shit was going to hit the fan, he wanted Nick firing on all twelve cylinders from the get-go. The doors opened, and he stepped out into the subbasement, scanning from wall to wall with every sense he possessed. Nothing. So why\u2014</p> <p>\u201cForgive me, my lord,\u201d Alex said from behind him. \u201cHe gave me no choice.\u201d</p><p>Lucas spun around to find Alex still standing in the open elevator door, his left hand punching a series of buttons on the control panel. Locking it down? Or . . .</p><p>In a flash of insight, Lucas understood everything Alex had done. He grabbed Kathryn and threw her toward the back wall of the elevator two seconds before the world exploded, and the entire building collapsed on top of them.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>The first thing Kathryn registered was dirt. Everywhere. It filled her eyes, her mouth, her nose. It covered every bare inch of skin and crawled down her blouse. She coughed, a horrible hacking sound that she wouldn\u2019t have believed could come from her own throat. She went to lift her hand, to brush the filthy hair from her face and bit back a scream of pain. Her arm. Something had happened to . . .</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d She\u2019d meant to scream his name, but what came out was little more than a raspy whisper of sound. God, she hurt. With every sense that returned, every nerve ending that came to life, she hurt more.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d She tried again, a raw croak this time. Still no answer.</p><p>She struggled to make sense of what had happened, her thoughts thick and slow as tree sap on a cold day. She tried to blink, to open her eyes and realized they were already open. That there was simply no light. Total blackness.</p><p>Closing her eyes again, she went back to first principles and took inventory of her body, wiggling toes, flexing muscles, bending knees. So far, so good. She moved her right hand cautiously. Her wrist was sore, strained most likely, her upper arm bruised and aching, but her hand worked, her fingers flexed. That was good news. She was right-handed.</p><p>Her left arm hadn\u2019t fared so well. The earlier pain had grown to a steady throb that beat in time with her heart. She reached over carefully and felt the warm wetness of fresh blood. That was bad, but probably not fatal.</p><p>Kathryn tried to roll over, so she could sit up, but there was a weight on her legs. Reaching down, she felt around with her good right hand and found some sort of metal sheeting. Grabbing an edge, she lifted it enough to bend her knees and shift her legs out from under it before letting it fall back into place with a clang and a fresh cloud of dust. She pulled her knees up to her chest and held on for a moment, shivering. Was she going into shock? She dismissed that possibility. Her arm wasn\u2019t bleeding enough for that. Internal bleeding was possible, but her quick inventory didn\u2019t seem to indicate any internal injuries.</p><p>She needed to remember. She needed to know where Lucas was. She needed light.</p><p>Her hand slapped down her hip and met the reassuring bulk of her Glock. Hoping against hope, she felt her way back along her belt and nearly laughed in relief at the touch of her small FBI-issue Maglite. She pulled the metal cylinder out of its holster carefully, not wanting to risk dropping it in the dark. Gripping it firmly, she clicked it on and froze.</p><p>Alex Carmichael\u2019s subbasement. She knew they shouldn\u2019t have trusted him. Treacherous, fucking vampire. She shined the flashlight upward and recognized the elevator, or what was left of it. Lucas had grabbed her at the last minute, throwing her back into the elevator with Carmichael who\u2019d been saying something, fiddling with the elevator buttons and then . . . A sudden panicked thought had her flicking her light across the elevator to the corner where Alex had been standing, half expecting to find him staring back at her. But the only things left of Alex Carmichael were the clothes he\u2019d been wearing, and those were literally punctuated by the big honking piece of steel that had ended his life. So the son of a bitch had ended up going suicide bomber on them, blowing up the whole fucking building and himself with it.</p><p>And Lucas . . . She struggled to picture those last moments. He\u2019d thrown her into the elevator and then . . .</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d She did scream his name this time. Her flashlight showed a tangled mound of wood, metal and concrete where the basement room had been. Could a vampire survive something like that? What if one of those pieces stabbed him in the heart, just like Alex? Was there a pile of dust and clothes under there somewhere that used to be Lucas? No, he was too much alive to die so uselessly. She wouldn\u2019t believe it. She couldn\u2019t. The pain she felt at the possibility of Lucas being dead was startling. When had he come to mean so much to her?</p><p>She shook herself mentally and put aside such thoughts for later. Lucas was under there somewhere, still alive but hurt, and she had to find him. She remembered Nicholas and Mason waiting outside. They\u2019d know something had happened\u2014it would be hard to miss an explosion of this size, after all\u2014and they\u2019d be bringing help, but would they be able to dig through the rubble and get down here?</p><p>Kathryn shot the Maglite\u2019s beam straight up over her head. The elevator wasn\u2019t going anywhere, that was for sure. Even if the shaft and its pulley mechanism had survived intact, the elevator itself was bent like an empty juice box. A fresh jolt of fear speared her gut. She was more than a touch claustrophobic. It was a control thing, but knowing that didn\u2019t make it any easier to breathe. Not when she thought about the tons of stone over her head, about whether anyone would dig them out before the air ran out\u2014or the wreckage crashed down on her head.</p><p>She scanned what was left of the basement one more time. Was it still a basement if there was no longer a building above it? It was more like a tomb. Piles of rock and rubble on top of them with no way out. She banished that thought quickly. There would be plenty of time to give up later. What she had to do now was venture out into that mess and find Lucas. She couldn\u2019t wait for Nicholas and the troops to arrive. Lucas couldn\u2019t wait. He\u2019d risked his life for hers, and she wasn\u2019t going to leave him out there alone.</p><p>There was no room to stand, so she duck-walked when she could and crawled when she had to. What was left of the floor was littered with jagged metal and glass, and she had to check every step she took, every place she put her hand down. It was slow and exhausting, but more than anything she was terrified of what she\u2019d find. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLucas.\u201d Kathryn kept saying his name, sometimes calling it out, sometimes whispering it desperately. She couldn\u2019t remember exactly where he\u2019d been when the explosion hit, so she started at the elevator and worked outward as much as possible. There was an awful lot of tangled metal, big heavy bars torn like paper, all twisted up with each other, the spaces filled in with huge chunks of concrete and dirt. She wasn\u2019t an engineer, but some of those beams seemed to be holding up the worst of the rubble from above, leaving small pockets at ground level. From far overhead, she thought she could hear shouting, and every once in a while, the air would fill with the sound of groaning metal. She imagined those thick beams straining under the weight of the demolished building. The first time she\u2019d heard the noise, she\u2019d been afraid something had cracked, and everything up there was about to end up down here. But increasingly, the crashing noises began to sound like an organized effort, almost like a construction site, and it gave her hope of a rescue. But that could take hours, and she had to find Lucas.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d she said again, nearly sobbing. Her chest hurt from trying to breathe the dusty air, her back ached from bending over in the cramped spaces. Her fingers were cut and bleeding from shoving aside jagged pieces of metal and concrete, and . . . she\u2019d begun to fear Lucas might actually be dead.</p><p>\u201cKathryn.\u201d</p> <p>She froze, not sure she\u2019d really heard it. \u201cLucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d he said weakly, and coughed.</p><p>Her flashlight searched the rubble and found nothing. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the left. The other left,\u201d he clarified when her light went the wrong way.</p><p>She forced herself to search slowly, moving the Maglite\u2019s narrow beam back and forth until she at last caught a flash of pale skin, nearly invisible in the twisted mass of steel.</p> <p>\u201cLucas!\u201d At first, she was unable to reach him. Kathryn was strong for a woman, but even she couldn\u2019t move all of that debris aside, even if it had been wise to do so. Frustrated, she duck-walked around to the left, toward where she was certain the outside wall had to be. Alternating her light between where she knew Lucas was and her current path, she found a tunnel of sorts through the wreckage and snaked into him on her belly, her skin crawling with the knowledge of everything that was hanging over them.</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d she murmured in dismay, running her flashlight over what little she could see of him. He was all but buried beneath a pile of concrete and rebar, only his head, shoulders, and one arm visible. She shimmied as close to him as she could get, ignoring the pain as sharp bits of rubble tore her clothes and dug into the skin of her knees and elbows.</p><p>His eyes opened, gleaming with a golden light that put her Maglite to shame.</p><p>\u201cKathryn.\u201d The words scraped dryly, and she wished she had some water to offer him. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you injured?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, not trusting her voice and feeling foolish. Tears overflowed her eyes, mingling relief with despair. Vampire or not, he was seriously injured. Broken bones, those internal injuries she\u2019d been worried about . . . that was just the beginning of what could be happening to Lucas.</p><p>\u201cSssh, don\u2019t cry.\u201d He reached for her with his one good hand. \u201cI\u2019m hard to kill, a cuisle. You\u2019re not rid of me just yet.\u201d A grimace of pain twisted his handsome face. He closed his eyes against it, but didn\u2019t groan, didn\u2019t cry out. It was everything Kathryn could do not to cry out for him.</p> <p>She nodded, not really believing him, but understanding the importance of him believing what he said.</p><p>\u201cAre you injured?\u201d he repeated, squeezing her fingers.</p><p>She swallowed past the knot of grief in her throat. He could have saved himself, but he\u2019d saved her instead. And now he was lying there broken and possibly dying, no matter how much he denied it.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not hurt. A few cuts. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d She twisted her fingers in his, then leaned forward and touched her lips to his mouth carefully. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kiss was a start.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. At least she meant to laugh. It was more of a broken sob, but that was okay. If he could tease, maybe there was hope. Maybe vampires really were tougher than she thought.</p><p>\u201cDo you need my blood?\u201d she asked urgently.</p><p>He grinned, his teeth flashing white despite the desperate circumstances. \u201cI shall remember this moment forever, Katie mine.\u201d He coughed harshly, then said, \u201cA bit of blood would be most welcome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do we . . . I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wrist will do quite well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Of course.\u201d Kathryn propped her flashlight in the dirt, angling it to provide light without blinding either one of them. She was wearing both a jacket and long-sleeved blouse. Both were torn and dirty, but remarkably the cuffs were intact. She pushed the left sleeve of her jacket up to her forearm and unbuttoned the cuff of her blouse, folding it up over the jacket to bare her wrist.</p><p>\u201cDo I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas took her arm with his free hand and brought it to his lips, kissing the soft skin of her wrist gently. \u201cSo soft, a cuisle. So fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFragile,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThere\u2019s a word not too many people would use to describe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they don\u2019t know you like I do.\u201d</p><p>Her words of protest died unsaid as his warm tongue swiped once, twice over the pulse point of her wrist. Her heart started hammering when he kissed her wrist. She knew the pleasure of his bite, and so did her body. Her breasts seemed suddenly too tight in the confining bra she\u2019d put on beneath her sensible cotton blouse this evening.</p><p>\u201cThis will hurt, Kathryn,\u201d he whispered, his breath blowing gently over her damp wrist. \u201cI\u2019d rather be between your legs, my cock buried in your oh so wet pussy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d she warned him, her face heating. \u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He struck without warning, his fangs sinking into the veins buried deep in her forearm. And he was right. It hurt much worse than when he bit her neck, but only for the few seconds it took for the euphoric in his bite to make it up to her brain. After that . . .</p><p>She let her head fall forward, fighting the wave of sexual ecstasy careening through her system. If her breasts had seemed sensitive before, they were sheer torment now, her bra scraping her engorged nipples as if it were the roughest lace instead of fine cotton. Heat built between her thighs, waves of sensation storming up into her womb, her abdomen.</p><p>A cry escaped her lips, her body shuddering as the climax hit her. Kathryn buried her face against her upper arm, thankful for the darkness. They were trapped in a basement, three stories of dirt, rock and metal on top of them, and she was having a damn orgasm.</p><p>Lucas lifted his mouth from her wrist, his fangs sliding painlessly from her vein. He licked the wounds and deposited another kiss on her wrist, but he didn\u2019t let go of her hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Kathryn,\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>She nodded. But couldn\u2019t look at him. She was too embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cKatie mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted just her eyes in a glance, then back down.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a look. Stop it, Kathryn. This is biology. It\u2019s how we survived the centuries before humans moved beyond superstition and into discos.\u201d</p><p>She smiled despite herself. \u201cDiscos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boon for the vampire community, a ghr\u00e1. But the true revolution was birth control. All of those beautiful women suddenly free and eager to indulge the sexuality men had enjoyed so liberally for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you were very popular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere? I\u2019m wounded. I\u2019ll have you know I still am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she added, meeting his steady gaze at last.</p><p>\u201cBesides lying here under this pile of rubble, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow badly are you injured, Lucas? The truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve a few broken bones under all of this. And may I say, never having broken a bone before . . . it hurts like hell. No, no,\u201d he added quickly, hearing Kathryn\u2019s involuntary gasp of dismay, \u201cI can handle it. Although I will expect some expressions of sympathy and admiration once this is all over with. Maybe you can stroke my forehead and say things like, \u2018Poor baby. You were so strong.\u2019 That sort of thing.\u201d The strain in his voice belied his easy words, his voice thin and strangled as if he was struggling to find enough oxygen to speak.</p><p>\u201cIf we get out of here, I\u2019ll stroke more than your forehead,\u201d Kathryn promised.</p><p>\u201cI find myself motivated, apart from your delicious blood donation, which will speed things up tremendously. Unfortunately, bones take time to heal, even for a vampire.\u201d His jaw clenched suddenly, his eyes closing as his face tightened in obvious pain.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d He grunted in response, so she continued. \u201cWhy would Alex do that? Try to kill us like that, and kill himself, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompulsion,\u201d Lucas said, his voice low with effort. \u201cHis master and I are enemies. He used Alex to go after me. Alex had no choice in what he did. He wasn\u2019t a bad guy.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn wasn\u2019t sure she agreed with that, but she wasn\u2019t going to argue with him. \u201cI think Nick and the guys are trying to get down here,\u201d she said quickly, wanting to distract him. She lifted her chin to indicate the almost constant noise now coming from above.</p><p>\u201cNicholas has begun a rescue effort,\u201d he confirmed in a strained whisper. \u201cBut that will take time.\u201d His voice eased, his expression lightening, as if the pain had ebbed, at least temporarily. \u201cWe\u2019ll be stuck here for hours yet. So, while the very special thing in my blood which makes me Vampire does its best to mend my broken bones, you can distract me by talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I say?\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t open his eyes, but his mouth curled into a lopsided smile. \u201cTell me you love me,\u201d he murmured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart twisted in her chest, but she couldn\u2019t say the words. Not even jokingly. They were too close to a truth she didn\u2019t want to acknowledge. \u201cPlease don\u2019t die,\u201d she whispered instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to die, a cuisle,\u201d he said, letting his Irish lilt roll through the words. \u201cI\u2019ve still got to get you unbuttoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can you heal broken bones like this without\u2014\u201d</p> <p>His golden eyes opened again, and she could read the pain in them, even as he spoke clearly. \u201cYou need to understand, Kathryn. The vampire symbiote doesn\u2019t care that my legs are trapped under a huge, fucking pile of rocks. It just wants them working again, and it\u2019s taking all of the healing power my body and blood possess to focus on that one task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me enough time, and I\u2019ll move this damned pile of trash off my legs. But then the bones will want to start healing all over again, because they\u2019re still under pressure right now, and not even the symbiote can make them straight and sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Lucas,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cHold my hand,\u201d he said, his eyes closing once more. \u201cDistract me. Tell me what happened after your parents died.\u201d</p> <p>Kathryn stared at him in the dim glow of her small flashlight, searching his face for any sign that he was manipulating her, using their dire predicament to get her to open up to him, to tell him something personal.</p><p>But his face was pale, even for him, and there were lines of pain creasing the corners of his closed eyes. His breathing was strained, and she thought about how hard it must be for him to breathe, how painful to lie there, feeling his own bones healing, and all the while knowing he\u2019d have to go through it all over again once he was freed.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think my parents are dead?\u201d she asked, to get him thinking about something, anything else.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way you relate to your brother, the way you talk about him. It\u2019s more like a parent than a sibling. Plus all this time we\u2019ve been looking for him, you\u2019ve never once mentioned a mother or father. I\u2019m guessing you were very young when they died. Maybe someone stepped in, a grandparent, an aunt or uncle, but you were older than your brother, and you felt responsible for him anyway.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t open his eyes, didn\u2019t look at her, but she could feel him waiting for her response. Her stomach roiled at the thought of baring her most painful moments, her private history. But he\u2019d told her his story, a life much harder than her own had been, despite her losses.</p><p>\u201cMy mother died when Daniel was two,\u201d she began. \u201cI was six. My father is still alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh. But neither of you are close to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe raised us alone. My grandparents\u2014the ones with the ranch\u2014offered to have us live with them, and my father could come out every weekend and be with us. He said no. We were his kids, and he wanted us with him. But he still had to work, of course. We had babysitters, but I\u2019d already been taking care of my brother almost since he was born. My mom was diagnosed with cancer just before she gave birth, and she started treatments right after.</p><p>My earliest memory is my father telling me the day my brother was born that I had to help my mom with the new baby because she was sick. They came home with Daniel, and I remember looking at him and thinking he was my responsibility now. When I was four years old, I already knew how to put a bottle together for my brother, how to heat it in the microwave before putting the cap on. I changed his diaper, although probably not well, and I rocked him to sleep. I was the one he wanted when he cried, not one of our parents. When he was a year old, I came home from my first day of kindergarten, and he was so happy to see me he took his very first steps. To me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did your father take all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was hard on him. My mom was sick for two years before she died, and I think it was actually easier for him after that. He loved us, but his job was an escape from everything. I can\u2019t blame him for that. He did the best he could, and I\u2019m grateful. He could have walked away when my grandmother offered, or pawned us off on my mom\u2019s sister, but he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s still alive. So where is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe remarried a few years ago. His new wife is younger, and they have a couple of kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore siblings for you. How lovely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess. I barely know them. They live in Arizona, and the kids are so much younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you really don\u2019t want any more siblings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any. I have Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He lapsed into silence, long enough that Kathryn felt a spike of fear.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d</p><p>Her heart jumped in alarm when he didn\u2019t answer, and she scooted closer, pressing her face to his and listening for his breath, waiting for the brush of warm air on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cKathryn,\u201d he breathed, soft enough that she wouldn\u2019t have heard it if she hadn\u2019t been so close. \u201cHave I told you I love you?\u201d</p><p>She kissed his closed eyes and then his mouth. \u201cHush,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSave your strength for the important stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove is important, a cuisle. You wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet after that, resting she supposed. But as long as he was still breathing, she figured the symbiote, as he called it, was still working on him, still trying to heal the devastating damage to this body. Kathryn lowered her face into the crook of her arm, still holding on to his hand. She was achingly tired, and she wondered how long they\u2019d have to wait down here.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d fallen asleep until a loud banging noise woke her. She startled awake, eyes wide. Her first thought was that something had given way overhead, some crucial piece of metal framework that had been holding everything else at bay, and now they were doomed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just Nicholas,\u201d Lucas said, his voice much stronger than it had been.</p><p>She stared at him. He looked tired beneath the dirt and grime, but his eyes were open and gleaming gold with power.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to get out of here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGet out?\u201d she repeated, confused.</p><p>\u201cFlash your light up there, will you?\u201d He lifted his eyes to indicate the tangle of metal beams and broken building lying on top of him.</p><p>Kathryn frowned, but did as he asked, moving the narrow beam of her flashlight back and forth above them until he grunted in satisfaction and said, \u201cThat\u2019s it. Do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, a little worried about what he was planning to do.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go back over by the elevator where you were before. I\u2019m not sure what will happen when I start shuffling things around, and I don\u2019t want you underneath here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said Nicholas was coming with the rest of the guys. I think we should wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in my nature to wait, a cuisle. Besides, I have a reputation to maintain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s deadly serious. Now, please, Kathryn, do as I ask and go back over by the elevator.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him unhappily for a long minute, then pursed her lips and nodded her agreement. She\u2019d just started to squirm her way back out the way she\u2019d come, when he stopped her with a hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cNo kiss for good luck?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn narrowed her eyes in irritation, but felt the smile tugging at her lips. \u201cYou better know what you\u2019re doing, Lucas Donlon, because I\u2019m not saving your ass again if all of this shit tumbles down on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>She scooted forward again and put her mouth against his, intending to give him a quick peck on the lips. But Lucas had other plans. His hand tunneled into the loose strands of her hair, holding her still as he gave her a searing kiss. His tongue slipped between her teeth, twining with her tongue, as his lips caressed her mouth. The tension fled Kathryn\u2019s body for a few precious moments as she reveled in the seduction of Lucas\u2019s touch, his strong fingers kneading the back of her neck, his kiss claiming her for himself, even if it was only for these few minutes in a dark basement.</p><p>He broke away slowly, and she liked to think his reluctance mirrored her own.</p><p>\u201cWhen this is over, Katie mine, you and I are going to spend several quality hours in a big bed with a bottle of good whiskey and no phones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig talk, vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig plans,\u201d he corrected. \u201cNow go. I\u2019m tired of having all this crap weighing me down.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn scowled. She didn\u2019t see how he thought he was going to get out of here without help. Vampire or not, there was just too much stuff in the way, and every bit of it weighed a ton. He waggled his fingers, as if pushing her on her way, so she complied. Scooting backwards, wincing when her injured arm brushed against a jagged piece of concrete, and again when something ripped open her pants leg and added to her cuts and bruises.</p><p>\u201cYou do understand the concept of moving to safety, don\u2019t you, a cuisle? One should at least try to get there in one piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am trying. This isn\u2019t easy, you know.\u201d</p><p>Another banging noise started up above, this one continuing for some time as Kathryn finally extricated herself from the worst of the rubble and half crawled, half duck-walked back to the dubious safety of the elevator shaft. The sound died down just before she got there, the final metallic ring echoing down the empty space of the shaft over her head.</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019re coming down this way?\u201d she called over to Lucas.</p><p>\u201cProbably. It avoids going through much of the debris. The alternative would be digging in through the side wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you and Nicholas were, you know, in touch.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed, sounding very nearly like his regular self. \u201cThere are limitations. Are you in the elevator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she snapped irritably</p><p>\u201cGet as far inside as you can. And you might want to close your eyes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kathryn did as he asked, closing her eyes with an impatient sigh loud enough for Lucas to hear. But inside, she was trembling, her heart racing. She squeezed herself into a tight corner of the elevator, straining to see in the dark, terrified that Lucas\u2019s luck was going to run out, that the next collapse would be one he couldn\u2019t survive.</p><p>Lucas crooked a smile at Kathryn\u2019s sigh of exasperation, He couldn\u2019t see her from the awkward position he was in, but he could hear her muttering to herself as she moved around. And he could sense her fear for him, the fear she was trying to cover up with her grumblings.</p><p>When he was as certain as he could be that she was safe, he stretched out his power and touched Nicholas.</p> <p>\u201cSire?\u201d Nicholas\u2019s thoughts were tight with worry.</p><p>\u201cAny complications from the human authorities so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA patrol car came out. Someone heard the blast and called it in. We had a nice chat, and they went away happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Are you coming down the elevator shaft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We had to move a few tons of debris first, but we finally cleared the shaft. We can cut through\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Kathryn\u2019s in there. I\u2019ll come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I move this fucking heavy pile, yeah. It\u2019s going to be . . . bad, Nick. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. I\u2019ve got the copter on stand-by if we need it. Are we going to the ranch or staying in St. Paul?\u201d</p><p>Lucas wanted to go home to his ranch in South Dakota, but it made more sense to remain in the Twin Cities. The sooner he reached safety, the sooner his body could start healing itself all over again, and he needed to get his strength back quickly. Klemens would know Alex Carmichael was dead, and he would also know that Lucas was not. Clearly he had planned on Lucas perishing in Alex\u2019s suicidal explosion, but even though he\u2019d survived, Klemens would assume he\u2019d been injured, leaving him weakened and perhaps vulnerable to attack. Lucas couldn\u2019t afford to be weak. Not unless he was prepared to surrender his people and territory to Klemens. That would never happen.</p><p>The ranch in South Dakota was his true lair, but the penthouse across the river in St. Paul would have to do. More than anything, he needed a safe place to rest while the vampire symbiote fixed what was wrong with his body.</p> <p>\u201cMake it the penthouse, Nick. As fast as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Sire.\u201d</p><p>Lucas closed his eyes, picturing the crushing mass of I-beams, concrete and rebar that he\u2019d seen in the light from Kathryn\u2019s flashlight. And then he added in the distance between his current location and the nearest wall where the destruction was the least pronounced. He steeled himself against the inevitable pain. He\u2019d told Kathryn his broken bones hurt like hell, but running on them the way they\u2019d been healed was going to be so much worse.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes, Kathryn,\u201d he called again, giving her a heads-up.</p><p>And then he moved.</p><p>A blast of pure power lifted the mass of wreckage above him with the groan of tortured metal and shattered rock. It was only a foot or two, and for only a few seconds, but it was enough for Lucas to spin face down and scramble on all fours out from under, reaching the relative safety of the wall with no more than a breath to spare as the massive weight came crashing down once again. The walls shook, and the ground shuddered under the tremendous impact. Everything shifted as the pile of debris settled into its new configuration, dirt and bits of concrete raining down on him like lethal snow.</p> <p>\u201cKathryn!\u201d he bellowed over the noise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she called back. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come out!\u201d he yelled quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Kathryn. Stay there.\u201d</p><p>Lucas crouched near the wall, knees tucked up against his chest, face buried in the protection of his arms until everything stopped moving. He lifted his head again. The air with still thick with particles of who knew what sort of garbage, but they had to get out of here. The pile hadn\u2019t been all that stable to begin with, and he feared he\u2019d only made it worse.</p><p>He forced himself to his feet, closing his eyes against the agony of bones that had healed bent and out of alignment. If he had to guess, he\u2019d say every bone in his right leg had been broken, plus at least the femur in his left. And his pelvis felt like ground glass every time he moved. That was the bad news. The good news was that the damage to vital organs had been minimal and was already healing. His lungs ached, but that was probably due as much to the thick air as anything else. And his heart was sound. Otherwise, he\u2019d be dead alongside old Alex Carmichael. He wondered if Kathryn had realized yet that Alex\u2019s remains were part of the dust she was breathing in. He decided not to share that particular fact.</p><p>It took him only a few minutes, inching down the wall, finding his way around the few smaller piles of mostly concrete and crushed furniture that barred his way. There were some electrical wires tangled up in all the mess, but they were dead. Nick had probably cut the main line as a precaution. As Lucas edged into the open front of the elevator, he straightened as much as possible. He didn\u2019t want Kathryn thinking too much about his physical condition. Didn\u2019t want her paying too much attention to the state of his legs in particular. She didn\u2019t need to know how bad it was.</p><p>She was sitting against the back wall of the elevator, head buried in her arms, her usually tidy ponytail hanging loose and disheveled. He smelled fresh blood and frowned. The wound on her arm was still leaking blood, and a nasty-looking gash marked her calf. It was the arm that troubled him the most. Even without a bandage, it should have clotted by now.</p><p>\u201cKathryn,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Her head came up, and he saw in her eyes what she\u2019d refused to tell him when he was still trapped. A beautiful smile split her face, and she laughed as she jumped up and came into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d she said, hugging him so tightly it hurt, but he held on anyway. \u201cDoes anything hurt?\u201d she asked, moving out of his arms too quickly as she stepped back to survey his aching body.</p><p>\u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle,\u201d he replied truthfully enough. \u201cWe need to get out of here, a cuisle. I\u2019m worried about this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, then looked at the crumpled elevator ceiling. \u201cUm. You have a plan?\u201d</p><p>Lucas grinned and grabbed a quick kiss that turned into a long kiss before he tore himself away. That damn chemistry again. Here they were buried in a hole of unstable rubble, and he still wanted her like he wanted his next breath. And judging from the high color on her previously pale face and the racing of her heart, she was feeling it, too.</p><p>\u201cEscape first,\u201d he said, dropping his hand to the swell of her perfect ass. \u201cSex later.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn met his gaze, her chest rising and falling with rapid breaths. She licked her lips. \u201cRight,\u201d she said, never breaking eye contact. They leaned toward each other like two magnets, before seeming to recognize at the same time what they were doing and pulling away.</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s waiting,\u201d he murmured, twisting a finger in her tangled hair.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed, but neither one of them moved.</p><p>Lucas smiled slowly, the smile becoming a grin. \u201cThere\u2019s a helicopter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven better,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to punch a hole in this damn elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. A kiss will make it better.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a lopsided grin of her own. \u201cYou think a kiss makes everything better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn cupped his cheek and touched her lips to his. She opened her mouth to say something, but she was interrupted when Nicholas chose that moment to yell down the shaft.</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d</p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes in disgust, but called back. \u201cYou ready, Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cue.\u201d Lucas looked around for a likely tool and found a five-foot-long piece of heavy steel bracing that was ragged and torn at the ends. \u201cStand back, and cover your eyes.\u201d He studied the enclosed space with a frown. \u201cBetter yet, stand just outside so you\u2019re not underneath whatever decides to come crashing down when I do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Kathryn asked as she moved to comply.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said, and rammed the piece of metal up through the top of the elevator, cutting through the damaged ceiling, shoving aside electrical wires and opening a hole. More junk immediately tumbled down into the elevator, concrete mostly, along with snaking lengths of thick, twisted cable that he assumed had once guided the elevator up and down.</p><p>But in addition to all of that came fresh air and, high above, the welcome sight of the night sky and Nicholas staring down at him with a worried look on his face.</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d Nicholas called, his voice full of relief.</p><p>\u201cSend us a rope, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do one better, my lord,\u201d Nick said and gestured to the side. Mason appeared overhead wearing a climbing harness with a heavy rope trailing behind him. He tugged the rope once, nodded to whoever was securing the lifeline, then slipped over the edge, falling freely for the first ten feet before the rope went taut, and he began to ease himself down toward the top of the elevator. Lucas appreciated the thought, but he wouldn\u2019t be ascending in Mason\u2019s strong arms, no matter how much his aching bones wanted to. But Kathryn would.</p><p>\u201cUp you go, Katie mine,\u201d he said, gesturing to Kathryn. \u201cYour rescuer awaits.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn eyed the big vampire doubtfully. \u201cCan\u2019t I just scale the side? You know, like a wall?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head. \u201cToo dangerous. Too many hazards sticking out, live wires and such,\u201d he added, lying just a little.</p><p>She frowned, but allowed him to boost her up and through the hole in the roof, where Mason waited. He had to grit his teeth as she went into the other vampire\u2019s arms. It shouldn\u2019t have bothered him that much, but it did. And the fact that it did told him she mattered more to him than he admitted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mason didn\u2019t waste any time. As soon as Kathryn was secure, he started for the surface. Not being used to vampire enhanced speed and strength, Kathryn gave a little shriek of surprise as Mason zoomed upward, his climbing boosted by vampires pulling from above. Their ascent was probably faster than the elevator itself would have been.</p><p>As soon as they reached the top, Kathryn immediately disengaged from Mason\u2019s hold and stepped away from the big vampire . . . much to Lucas\u2019s satisfaction. But then the next task awaited him. He sighed, thinking not for the first time that vampire pride and competitiveness was a pain in the ass sometimes.</p><p>\u201cJust the rope, Nick,\u201d he called up.</p> <p>Nick peered over the edge at him and opened his mouth to protest, but something in Lucas\u2019s expression made him stop. Or maybe it was the waves of aggression floating up out of the damn hole in the ground. In any event, the thick rope was soon slithering down toward him. Lucas grabbed it, then gritted his teeth and began climbing, hand over hand, until he reached the top.</p><p>Nicholas grabbed his arm as soon as he crested the edge of the hole, bracing him unobtrusively under the cover of pulling him in for a quick man hug before stepping back. Lucas appreciated the gesture and the loyalty of his lieutenant. A vampire lord could never afford to display weakness. Nick understood that.</p><p>Lucas scanned his assembled vampires, seeking the smallest indication of disloyalty. But he found nothing but relief, love, and a steely determination for revenge against whoever had tried to assassinate their master. And revenge was definitely in their future. But not tonight. Lucas was in pain and exhausted. He wanted his bed and he wanted Kathryn.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Kathryn,\u201d he said, holding out a hand.</p><p>She looked at it, then raised her eyes to study his face. For a moment, he thought she was going to reject him, but then something in her gaze surrendered. She laced her fingers with his, and he sighed inwardly. He was going to need all of his strength for what he had to do next.</p> <p>Kathryn eyed Lucas as they rode the elevator to the penthouse floor. Something was wrong. Granted he had to be worn out after everything he\u2019d been through. She was certainly exhausted, and his ordeal had been far worse than hers. It was more than just weariness, though.</p><p>He\u2019d held onto her hand all the way here. Not unusual in itself; Lucas was a very touchy-touch kind of guy. But every once in a while on the drive home, his grip had tightened almost to the point of pain, and she\u2019d caught a fleeting expression of distress on his handsome face. He\u2019d told her his bones had healed improperly, that the vampire symbiote would want to fix them once he was free, but . . . did that mean it was working on him already?</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d She leaned close enough to whisper in his ear, softly enough that she didn\u2019t think even another vampire could hear. But there was only Nicholas in the elevator with them, and Lucas seemed to trust him above all the others.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said in a voice not at all like his usual cheerful lilt.</p><p>She frowned, but didn\u2019t push him. Maybe it wasn\u2019t kosher for a vampire lord to shown pain, even among those he trusted.</p><p>When the penthouse doors opened, she started to step out, but Lucas stopped her. \u201cNick will set you up on a lower floor. It doesn\u2019t lock down during daytime, so you\u2019ll be more comfortable there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I stay with you?\u201d she asked, hating the idea of him suffering alone through whatever was happening.</p><p>Lucas looked down at her, his gaze softening as he cupped her cheek and rubbed his thumb over her lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be here for this, a cuisle. I don\u2019t want you here for this. It won\u2019t be pretty, but, trust me, I\u2019ll get through it. And tomorrow night you can do that stroking we talked about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, I\u2019m not afraid of a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathryn. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her lips flattened unhappily, but she nodded. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll just go back to my hotel and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI don\u2019t think you were a target tonight, but Klemens knows about you now, and he may try to use you against me. I don\u2019t want you hurt. Give Nick your hotel key, and he\u2019ll send one of the daytime guards over to get your stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, I may spend most of my time at a desk these days, but I\u2019m still a trained FBI agent. I know how to protect myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Klemens is a vampire lord. You saw what I was able to do tonight, even as injured as I was. Can you defend against that? Please,\u201d he added, when she glared at him stubbornly. \u201cOne night. What can it hurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she conceded. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to the hotel with your guard. I\u2019d rather pack my own things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll come right back,\u201d Lucas clarified.</p><p>\u201cYes, Daddy,\u201d she drawled, rolling her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll come right back.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave her a tired, lopsided grin, then lowered his mouth to hers and kissed her thoroughly. \u201cMy feelings for you are definitely not paternal, Katie mine.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn blushed, knowing Nicholas was watching and listening to everything, but she reached up and gently stroked Lucas\u2019s face from forehead to jaw. \u201cPoor baby,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou were so strong, so brave.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed and gave her one last, hard kiss. \u201cI seem to recall other promises were made. I\u2019ll expect payment in full when I see you tonight.\u201d He looked over her head at Nicholas. \u201cEverything\u2019s waiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. Would you like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, not you, too, Nick. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Lucas exited the elevator and disappeared into the unlit depths of the penthouse.</p><p>Kathryn watched until the doors closed, but he never looked back. She leaned against the elevator wall then, staring down at her filthy clothes, very conscious of Nicholas standing just a few feet away from her in the confined space. Finally, she looked up to find him studying her.</p><p>\u201cWill he be all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Nicholas blinked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave him up there if I didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded unhappily and said, \u201cOkay, I guess. About this hotel trip . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas Donlon is my master, Agent Hunter. It will be done exactly as he ordered.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn sighed. She seemed to remember being in charge of her own life just a few short days ago. She had to wonder when she\u2019d lost it and when Lucas Donlon had taken over instead.</p><p>Lucas closed the door of the penthouse behind him, more grateful than words could express to be alone with his pain. It had taken every ounce of energy he had left to keep up appearances, not just for Kathryn, but for Nick and the others, too. Maybe it hadn\u2019t been necessary, but it was instinct. Besides, if he\u2019d given in to the agony of his body, he\u2019d have been screaming at the top of his lungs and ripping great chunks out of the SUV\u2019s upholstery in an attempt to ease the pain.</p><p>He went directly to the security console and, not waiting for sunrise, lowered the steel shutters and locked everyone out. Next stop was the refrigerator behind the bar which was stocked with bags of fresh blood. A hundred years ago, Nick would have grabbed someone off the street and had them waiting for Lucas to drain dry. With any luck that person would have been a criminal of some sort, someone the world was better off without. But Lucas didn\u2019t delude himself that mistakes had never been made, or that sometimes there just hadn\u2019t been enough time before sunrise to be choosy. The one saving grace was that it didn\u2019t happen often. The kind of damage Lucas had suffered tonight was a rare thing for someone of his strength.</p><p>And human blood banks were open twenty-four hours a day.</p><p>Lucas grabbed a glass bowl from under the bar and filled it with water, then set it in the microwave to boil. While he waited, he tore the valve off the first bag of blood and drank it cold. It tasted awful going down his throat, but once it hit his stomach the cold didn\u2019t matter. His body began to use it immediately. The microwave dinged. Using a bar towel, he lowered the water-filled bowl to the counter and eased a second bag of blood into the hot water, releasing the valve slowly.</p><p>He was reaching for a third bag to drink cold when his phone rang. Not his cell phone, which was buried somewhere beneath Alex Carmichael\u2019s building, but his landline. He glanced at the caller ID, but was already reaching for the phone. He knew who it was.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Raphael\u2019s deep, familiar voice greeted him. \u201cWhom have you pissed off now?\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled to himself. \u201cI am well, thank you. Okay, perhaps not well, but only bent, not broken. Not permanently anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more qualifiers you\u2019d like to add?\u201d Raphael asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough few hours. I won\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKlemens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, though as usual he didn\u2019t get his own hands dirty. A human assassin for you, and poor Alex Carmichael for me. Klemens had him under a compulsion. To his credit, Alex fought it, but it was no contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael agreed thoughtfully. \u201cKlemens takes the coward\u2019s way, but he does have power when he chooses to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, his time has run out. I have people in place keeping an eye on him. If they can pinpoint his location tomorrow night, I\u2019m going after him.\u201d</p><p>There was a very un-Raphael-like pause, before he said, \u201cLucas, be very certain you\u2019re ready for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle him, Sire. You won\u2019t be rid of me that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the FBI agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe nearly died along with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was foolish of Klemens. Her death would have brought unwanted attention, even for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he knew she\u2019d be with me.\u201d</p><p>Raphael was silent for a moment. \u201cThe FBI agent is with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lucas laughed. \u201cWhat can I say, Raphael? Women love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep telling me. I assume she\u2019s not there now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot even I could get it up tonight, my lord.

When I go after Klemens, it will be a vampires-only invitation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have plenty of blood for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it, then.

The third bag he\u2019d been about to drink cold went into the still-hot bowl of water to warm. He took two more cold bags from the fridge and carried them into the bedroom to drink while he got ready. He\u2019d be sleeping in his spare bedroom this morning. The day was likely to get ugly, and he didn\u2019t want the mess or the memories in the place he usually slept. He had less than thirty minutes before sunrise. His number one priority had to be drinking as much blood as possible, even if that meant it had to be cold and tasteless. His body would need all the energy it could get to heal itself. But he desperately wanted a shower, too. He was covered in dirt and concrete dust, and who knew what kinds of crud lived in a building that old. The blood could warm in the hot water of his shower, and if he hurried, he could manage two more units after that.</p><p>But any way he looked at it, even with every ounce of blood in the fridge, it was going to be a long, fucking day.</p><p>Daniel ignored the now familiar sounds from the hallway outside the room. His tormentor\u2014although that was probably too strong a word unless boredom could be considered torture\u2014had returned for their nightly ritual. He assumed it was nightly anyway, because the man had a job to do, and as far as Daniel could tell, he was still doing it. He\u2019d even shown up in his uniform once or twice. Night after night, he brought food and water, then sat and expressed his admiration for Dan\u2019s work, even going so far as to bring some of his photographic books to drool over. Creepy didn\u2019t begin to describe it. At least the woman he\u2019d heard the other night had a practical reason for kidnapping him. She wanted money. Daniel would be happy to pay them as much as they wanted if they\u2019d just let him out of this disgusting room.</p><p>He thought about how Kathryn had despaired of the mess he created in every room he lived or worked. He made a promise to whatever gods of order were listening that if they\u2019d just get him out of this predicament, he\u2019d be neat and tidy for the rest of his life. Or at least he\u2019d try.</p><p>The door creaked open, bringing light with it as his captor flipped the switch in the hallway.</p> <p>\u201cGood evening, Daniel,\u201d the freak said cheerfully, just as he did every night. As if he really believed they were somehow friends, and this was simply a pleasant evening\u2019s diversion.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t respond, didn\u2019t sit up, didn\u2019t even look at the idiot. He lay on his uncomfortable bunk with one arm over his eyes and ignored him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought you a steak sandwich this evening. Your favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell would you know?\u201d Daniel muttered.</p><p>\u201cJoanie at the coffee shop told me,\u201d he said, sounding pleased, and Daniel cursed himself for asking the question.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something else, too.\u201d</p><p>The familiar clicking sound of a digital camera in burst mode had Daniel turning to look.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he demanded, jumping up and snatching the camera before his captor could grab it back. \u201cThat\u2019s one of mine!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d the creep said in a wounded tone. \u201cYour sister left it all at the Sheriff\u2019s Station for safekeeping. I had to sneak it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean left it? Where\u2019d she go?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe she went home.\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s heart sank at this bit of news, even though he told himself it couldn\u2019t be true. For one thing, Kathryn would never have left his equipment behind if she was leaving for good. For another\u2014and this was the important one\u2014she would never have given up on him. Kathryn was the one constant in his life, the one who\u2019d always been there for him. He had to remember that, to believe it. His captor was just fucking with his head, trying to make him believe he had no one left. This asshole must be the loneliest person in the world if he thought he could kidnap people and make them his friends. Stockholm Syndrome, my ass.</p><p>\u201cCan I keep this?\u201d Dan asked, sparing a quick glance at his kidnapper. Enough to see the man\u2019s face light up at the question.</p><p>\u201cOf course! That\u2019s why I brought it to you. I apologize for not thinking of it sooner. It was completely thoughtless on my part.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, this guy was pathetic. \u201cYeah, right. Okay. Can I have my dinner now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, your steak! It must be cold. Should I microwave it or something?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to zap steak? What a moron. But all he said was, \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. I\u2019ll just get it from the kitchen then. Would you like a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Daniel said, snapping a quick picture as his captor turned away to bring in the food, covering the small sound it made with his words. \u201cThat\u2019d be nice.\u201d</p><p>By the time his captor returned, the camera was lying on the bed. He noticed and frowned. \u201cYou want to be careful with that. Make sure you move it before the lights go off. You don\u2019t want to sit on it or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, about that. How about you leave the lights on so I can take some shots. Artsy stuff, you know,\u201d he added with an inflection meant to flatter the freakazoid into thinking he and Dan shared an understanding of true art.</p><p>The nut job\u2019s face lit up like Christmas. \u201cThat would be splendid!\u201d He frowned as if having second thoughts, but said, \u201cI suppose it can\u2019t hurt to leave the light on for one day. But no more than that,\u201d he scolded, as if addressing a child.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Dan said, fighting the urge to tell this creep what he really thought.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the nut job said primly, then settled down to watch Dan eat as he did every night. \u201cNow, what shall we talk about tonight?\u201d</p><p>Daniel didn\u2019t answer. He found that the freak didn\u2019t really want conversation. He mostly wanted someone to listen to his ramblings, and Dan was more interested in eating. His captor only brought food once a day, and Dan had discovered early on that the man\u2019s mood was unpredictable. Some nights he lingered for hours, yammering about his life, his job, whatever tedious tidbits he could resurrect from his clearly deranged mind. Other nights, he grew impatient after only a few minutes, leaving Daniel with a half-finished meal and still hungry.</p><p>It seemed likely that tonight would be a long one, given the man\u2019s excitement over the camera. But Daniel wasn\u2019t taking any chances. He ate the cold steak, the tepid baked potato, even the broccoli, which he generally detested, because one of these nights, this asshole was going to slip up, and Dan would be ready.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Twin Cities, Minnesota</p><p>Lucas went directly from his bed to another hot shower when he woke after sunset. The day had been rugged, even worse than he\u2019d expected. To call it sleep would be a gross misstatement. He\u2019d been in excruciating pain for much of it, pain that had made the agony of being crushed by tons of debris pale in comparison. He\u2019d woken covered in bloody sweat. The sheets had been soaked red, torn to shreds from his daytime thrashing. His body still ached from the memory of it, while at least a part of his mind kept waiting for it to begin again, not quite trusting that it was over. No human could have survived such torture and remained sane. Even Lucas had never experienced anything like it.</p><p>He wrapped a towel around his waist and crossed to the steam-fogged mirror, rubbing a spot clear. His beard was a dark shadow along his jaw. He needed to shave. On the other hand, he had a beautiful woman waiting for him. The choice was easy.</p><p>He dropped the towel as he headed out of the bathroom, aiming for his bedroom closet. The sound of a sucked in breath had him turning toward the door.</p><p>\u201cKathryn,\u201d he said, unsurprised. He\u2019d known she was in the penthouse. She wouldn\u2019t have been allowed into the elevator, much less out of it, without his permission. The first thing Lucas had done on waking was call Nick, to assure him he had survived the day, and to tell him to admit Kathryn to the penthouse when she showed up. She\u2019d arrived while he was still in the shower\u2014he\u2019d taken enough of her blood to sense her presence\u2014and he\u2019d been glad he\u2019d had the foresight to close the door to the other bedroom where he\u2019d spent the day. He didn\u2019t want Kathryn to witness the evidence of his agonizing recovery.</p><p>He took in the welcome sight of her curves in a pair of faded jeans that clung and made him wish she\u2019d turn around, so he could see the perfection of her denim-covered ass. Her feet were bare, her toenails polished in bright red. Like the underwear, a sexy side of his Kathryn that she hid from the world. But not from him. And speaking of underwear, or lack thereof, she was braless beneath a dark blue FBI T-shirt.</p><p>His perusal reached her face and found her eyes traveling up his body in turn, lingering, he was pleased to see, on his growing erection.</p><p>Lucas grinned. \u201cUp here, a cuisle,\u201d he drawled, tapping his chin.</p><p>Kathryn blushed right on schedule, but she met his gaze defiantly. \u201cYou appear remarkably healthy for a man who was crushed under a building less than twenty-four hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Katie mine,\u201d he crooned, crossing over to her and tilting her stubborn chin up with a finger. \u201cI keep telling you, I\u2019m not a man. I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his mouth to hers. Their lips met with a spark of recognition, an almost electrical shock of instant desire. Kathryn\u2019s mouth opened beneath his, and he swept his tongue past her soft lips in a lazy exploration that very quickly turned into something demanding and insistent. Lucas changed the angle of his kiss so he could go deeper, cupping the nape of her neck in a possessive grip, holding her in place as his other hand dropped to her lower back and tucked her up against his naked body. Kathryn moaned into his mouth, her strong hands sliding from his waist to his back, digging into his newly healed muscles as she demanded in turn. This heat between them was never one-way, it was two combustible elements coming together and creating a fire neither one could control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas stepped back to grab the edges of her T-shirt and pull it over her head, dropping it to the floor as his fingers swept up her bare back and around to frame her beautiful breasts. They were heavy in his hands as he admired them, her dark pink nipples swollen and erect, standing out against large, pale areolas. He rubbed his thumbs over her nipples, smiling in appreciation as they hardened into tight peaks.</p><p>Kathryn grabbed his wrists and rubbed her breasts against his hands like a sweet kitten begging to be petted. She rose up on her toes and brought her mouth to his in a hard, hungry kiss, her tongue pushing against his, fighting for control. He bit her tongue teasingly, enough to establish dominance without breaking the skin, opening his bite almost immediately. But there was nothing teasing about her response as her blunt teeth sank hard into his lower lip, drawing blood. Kathryn swept her tongue over the small injury in a sensuous caress, licking away the few drops of blood. Lucas\u2019s body hardened as her throat moved in a swallow, taking him into her in a whole new way.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he growled, \u201cI bite back.\u201d He lifted her off her feet, his arms around her back, holding her in a tight embrace as he plundered her mouth, crushing her lips beneath his, flattening her naked breasts against his chest, her skin soft as satin, her nipples like twin pearls.</p> <p>\u201cLucas,\u201d she whispered, the sound full of desire, but touched with fear, as his blood hit her system, and she experienced for the first time what it really meant to have a vampire lover.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, a cuisle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cCan you . . . are you well enough . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed and swept his arm under her legs, lifting her off her feet and carrying her over to the bed. He dropped Kathryn onto the mattress, then reached for the zipper to her denims, pulling it down and stripping her naked in a single move. Holding her gaze, he dropped to one knee between her legs and ran his hands up her calves to her knees. He bent her legs and pushed them wide, baring her sex to his hungry stare. He licked his lips slowly, then looked up again and met her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMine, Katie. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucas, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He never heard whatever protest she\u2019d been about to make, only the sound of her indrawn breath as he dropped to the bed between her thighs and licked, running his tongue along her slit, opening her outer lips to reveal her swollen pussy, wet and flushed with desire. He licked again, tasting her, swirling his tongue over the sensitive nub of her clit. He narrowed his eyes with lust at the sight of that concentrated bundle of nerves standing up proudly from beneath its hood, hard and red as a cherry, almost quivering with excitement. He pressed his tongue over its eager hardness, and Kathryn moaned, lifting herself against his mouth.</p><p>Lucas grabbed hold of her hips with a growl, letting her know that he was the one in control. At least for now. Sex with Kathryn was a delicious battle for dominance, and one he didn\u2019t mind losing on occasion. But not tonight, and not in this moment.</p><p>He began sucking hard on her sensitive nub, drawing it up further from its protective sheathing as Kathryn bucked beneath him. When the hard, little cherry was swollen to twice its size, when Kathryn\u2019s fingers were gripping his hair so hard it hurt, he bit down and tasted the sweetest blood of all. Kathryn screamed as the chemicals in his bite hit the very nerve center of her pussy. Her back arched as an orgasm swept over her, her muscles spasming beneath his fingers, her sex clenching against his mouth. She was crying, tears running down her cheeks with an overload of sensation, murmuring his name over and over again, like a plea for something.</p><p>No, not something, Lucas thought to himself. He knew what she wanted. What she needed. What they both needed. He lifted his mouth from the silky place between her thighs and prowled up her body, licking and kissing, lingering to fill his mouth with her swollen nipples, to lick the sweat from between her breasts, gliding higher until the hard length of his cock rested between her legs, against the volcanic heat of her core.</p><p>\u201cKathryn,\u201d he growled. He waited until her eyes opened, blurry with desire as she gazed up at him. And then he plunged his cock deep into her body, groaning as her hot, wet channel closed around him, still vibrating from her orgasm as she welcomed him inside. He pushed into her until he was fully sheathed, until his balls slapped against her perfect ass, and her legs came up and curved over his back.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around him, her short nails digging into his back, her eyes closed as the walls of her vagina pulsed and shivered. Lucas leaned down and kissed her eyelids one at a time. She opened her eyes and smiled up at him with such naked emotion that his breath caught in his chest. And then, as if realizing what she\u2019d done, or fearing what she\u2019d given away, she closed her eyes again and began lifting her hips in the timeless mating rhythm, undulating beneath him, so her breasts brushed against his chest as her pussy slid up and down his cock.</p><p>Lucas let her control the rhythm for a few minutes, enjoying the silk and cream glide of her body, the graze of her hard nipples over his chest. He leaned down, tucking his face against her neck and inhaling deeply, taking in the scent of her skin, her sweat, and the delicious heat of her blood so close to the surface.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s heart was a drumbeat against his chest as her movements sped up, as her hips thrust frantically. Lucas laid a lingering kiss on the velvet softness of her neck, smiling as Kathryn shivered in anticipation. She was panting now, her fingers gripping the back of his neck, her head turned to one side as if offering herself to his bite.</p><p>He pressed his lips along the plump swell of her jugular until he found the perfect spot, and then he sucked hard, pulling her vein into his mouth and releasing it. Kathryn moaned and dropped one hand to his ass, fucking him frantically to relieve the beginning of a climax he could feel rippling along his cock.</p><p>He lifted his mouth and blew softly on her wet skin. She trembled. Without warning, he bit into her vein, closing his eyes in ecstasy as the warm honey of her blood rolled down his throat, causing his heart to hammer against his ribcage, his nerves to thrum with excitement as heat filled every inch of his body.</p><p>Kathryn froze beneath him, as if caught in a moment of time, and then she screamed as every muscle in her body seemed to spasm at once, her legs scissoring over his hips, her arms tightening across his back as her nails dug in, scoring his back until he could feel the warm flow of his own blood. His cock grew impossibly hard as her inner muscles convulsed around him, rippling and stroking his shaft.</p><p>Lucas groaned, his fangs still buried in Kathryn\u2019s neck, her blood still filling his mouth. Lifting his head, he swallowed, reveling in the unique taste of her as his hips resumed pumping, slamming his cock deep between Kathryn\u2019s legs as she writhed around him. Her breath was coming in short, puffing gasps, and she was giving little wordless cries of pleasure that made his dick twitch and his balls tighten, made his climax build to an unbearable weight before it finally rushed down his shaft, a fiery flood of release that splashed against Kathryn\u2019s womb, branding her with his heat, marking her as his.</p><p>Lucas collapsed against Kathryn\u2019s overheated body, his face still buried in the crook of her neck. Lifting his head slightly, he licked away the few drops of blood from the neat puncture wounds, sealing them with the chemical in his saliva. In a few hours, there would be no visible trace of his bite, although Kathryn\u2019s body would remember far longer than that. He grinned at the thought.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you grinning about?\u201d</p><p>He shifted his gaze and found her watching him. \u201cThere are so many things that I don\u2019t know where to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit,\u201d she responded lazily. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn flexed her inner muscles, caressing his cock, which was still semi-hard and buried inside her. \u201cIf you were all ears, boyo, we wouldn\u2019t be here at all.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed. \u201cPoint taken. But you\u2019re avoiding the question. What was I thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were being all me Tarzan, her Jane. Guys always get that smug look when they make a woman come, like no one\u2019s ever done it before.\u201d</p><p>She slapped his ass playfully, but Lucas felt a sudden surge of rage that made him want to fuck her so senseless she wouldn\u2019t ever even think about another man. His eyes must have gone gold, because Kathryn was giving him a wary look.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he growled, knowing he was overreacting and somewhat shocked at his own anger. Of course she\u2019d had other lovers before him. God knew he\u2019d had more than his share. It was probably all the blood he\u2019d consumed the night before. It had given the symbiote enough power to heal him, but it also brought every other vampire characteristic to fore, including a vicious possessiveness about this particular woman.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Kathryn questioned.</p><p>He brought his power under control with an act of will and focused on the woman beneath him. \u201cOf course,\u201d he lied, and lowered his head to kiss her before rolling off to one side. \u201cI was just thinking about Klemens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the vampire who sent Alex to kill you?\u201d she asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cYes. Though your presence must have been a nasty surprise. Not even Klemens is foolish enough to try to murder an FBI agent.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn shrugged and sat up, tossing her long hair behind her. Lucas reached out to tangle his fingers in the silky strands, tempted to use it to pull her back down beside him, or more specifically, beneath him, so he could demonstrate his superiority to any other lover she might have, past or future.</p><p>A phone rang in the other room. Lucas frowned at the unfamiliar tone, but Kathryn patted his shoulder and said, \u201cNick gave me a new cell phone for you. That\u2019s probably it.\u201d</p><p>Lucas got up and stalked from the room, still pissed at both himself and Kathryn. He found the phone on the table near the door. It was just like his old one and no doubt already contained all of the information his old one did, too.</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKlemens, my lord. We know where he is, and he\u2019ll be there all night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcellent. How much time do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready, and the plane is waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven better. Give me ten minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas disconnected and strode back into the bedroom, going straight for the shower once more.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Kathryn jumped out of bed and hurried after him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Lucas closed the shower door and stepped under the hot spray without answering. Kathryn was not so easily deterred, however. The door opened, and she joined him, pumping a handful of his shower gel and washing herself off quickly as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not going anywhere. I\u2019m going to pay Klemens a visit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck that. He has my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex had Daniel, and now Alex is dead. And according to you, he was acting under orders from this Klemens asshole, which means Klemens is probably holding Daniel. I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne . . . no, you\u2019re not. This is vampire business, and it\u2019s going to be ugly. And two . . . I don\u2019t think Alex ever had your brother, hence, Klemens doesn\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d she said, snarkily continuing his count . . . I don\u2019t care what you think. And four . . . I don\u2019t need your permission to do whatever I want, big guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but you don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, like I can\u2019t find out. Even vampires have to file flight plans, and I can certainly get the tail numbers from your planes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can put you into a sleep so you don\u2019t wake up until it\u2019s all over,\u201d Lucas ground out.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can charge you with assault on a federal officer,\u201d she snapped, getting up in his face.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll fix it so you don\u2019t remember that, either,\u201d he responded, shoving his face so close to hers that their noses were touching.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is your problem?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you don\u2019t. You\u2019ve been pissy ever since . . . Oh, please. Just because I said all guys get smug after sex? What? You\u2019re too good to be lumped in with other men?\u201d</p><p>Lucas snarled and grabbed her around the waist, shoving her against the tiled wall and holding her there with his body. \u201cI am not a man at all. You should remember that.\u201d</p> <p>Kathryn grinned, then licked a drop of water from his chin. \u201cYou sure act like one sometimes.\u201d She rubbed her foot up the back of his calf, and his cock hardened instantly. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t believe we have time to act on that,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Lucas bared his teeth and tightened his grip around her, lifting her until his cock was nestled in the soft triangle between her thighs. \u201cThere\u2019s always time,\u201d he growled and pushed into her wet heat, thrusting forward until his shaft was fully seated, their bodies skin to skin in the steamy shower.</p><p>Kathryn gasped at the unexpected intrusion. Her head fell back, and her eyes closed, the big vein in her neck straining with the sudden rush of blood, almost begging to be tapped. Lucas bent close, licking and tasting her lips, her jawline, dipping his tongue into her ear before running it roughly over her plump jugular. The leg she\u2019d been rubbing along the back of his calf was now clamped around his hips, pumping gently as she encouraged him to get closer . . . and to move. Lucas grinned and began fucking her, thrusting steadily in and out as he squeezed the firm globes of her luscious ass.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play fair,\u201d she breathed as she gripped his shoulders, flexing the muscles of her butt as she thrust against him.</p><p>\u201cFuck fair,\u201d he whispered against her ear, then dropped his lips to the delicate skin of her neck and sank his fangs into her honey-sweet vein.</p><p>Kathryn jolted when the euphoric in his bite hit her bloodstream, her muscles clenched in anticipation of the coming orgasm. A full-body shudder rippled from her head to her toes, her leg tightening around his hips, holding him inside her as the tiny muscles of her sheath trembled along his shaft. Kathryn cried out suddenly, nails digging into his shoulders as her body fisted around him like a warm, wet glove. Her cry became a keening wail as the orgasm swept over her, and she began pumping against him furiously trying to ease the ache. Lucas lifted his mouth from her neck and licked the twin puncture wounds. He would have liked to take her back to bed, to have wrung every last bit of climax from her trembling body before seeking his own. To remind her of the pleasure he could give her over and over again, and let her try to find a human lover who could match it. Or another vampire who would dare touch her. She was his, or she was no one\u2019s. But there wasn\u2019t enough time.</p><p>He growled at the thought, enraged that she could bring him to this, enraged that he had permitted it. He tightened his hold on her and fucked harder, slamming his hips against hers until he felt the overwhelming heat of his own climax building to a roar, tightening his balls and hardening his cock as he thrust into the tight fist of her body before he came with a shout of triumph, filling her once more with his release.</p><p>Lucas eased Kathryn\u2019s legs back to the shower floor. She held onto him for a moment, her strong fingers gripping his arms almost painfully tight. Her heart was pounding rapidly, her breasts pulsing with the force of it. It was the exertion of their lovemaking, but also the heat of the shower which had been running the entire time, making the shower stall more like a steam room than a shower.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, bracing her gently.</p><p>She nodded and licked her lips. \u201cPoint made, vampire,\u201d she said, her husky voice breathless, her muscles trembling beneath his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely one of a kind.\u201d</p><p>Lucas felt a rush of pleasure, but tamped it down, only permitting himself a slight smile before saying, \u201cIf you\u2019ve finished accosting my manly self, I\u2019ve got to get ready. Nick and the rest will be waiting for me downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she agreed, brushing her wet hair out of her face. She frowned. \u201cI\u2019ll probably need to borrow some clothes from you. I didn\u2019t come prepared for skulking around in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Lucas released her and stepped back. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, because you won\u2019t be doing any skulking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, be reasonable. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that. The only thing you\u2019ll do is get in the way and end up getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>She punched his arm hard enough to hurt. \u201cFuck you. I train every fucking day for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he responded. \u201cIf you\u2019re so tough, take me down. Right here, right now.\u201d He strode out of the shower and into the living room where he found the sidearm she always wore. He shook it loose from its holster. \u201cHere\u2019s your Glock,\u201d he said, holding it out to her. \u201cShoot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to shoot you,\u201d she said, clearly appalled at the idea.</p><p>\u201cTake the gun, Kathryn.\u201d He pushed it into her hand, and she grabbed it from him, racking the slide to verify its readiness as she scooted back to put several feet between them.</p><p>\u201cStop that, Lucas. There\u2019s no external safety on a Glock. This weapon\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas replied dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m terrified. So shoot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d she spit angrily, \u201cI\u2019m not going to shoot you. This isn\u2019t a fucking game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, Kathryn,\u201d Lucas demanded, advancing on her menacingly. \u201cDo it, or I\u2019ll take it and do it for you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in disbelief for no more than a few seconds before the gun came up between them. \u201cStop it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be funny. I\u2019m making a point. Shoot me.\u201d He kept advancing, then purposely let his fangs emerge to press against his lower lip. \u201cDo it, do it, do it,\u201d he thundered, punctuating each one with a pounding footstep.</p><p>\u201cNo further, Lucas,\u201d she said, deadly serious now, the gun absolutely steady in her hand.</p><p>\u201cMake me stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d She raised the gun a fraction, and he saw the slightest tension in her right hand as she prepared to pull the trigger.</p><p>And then he moved. Two seconds later, her gun was his, and he had her wrapped up tight in his other arm, spitting mad.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking asshole,\u201d she snarled. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas released her without an argument, and she stumbled several feet away from him. But he held onto the gun. He wasn\u2019t a total idiot.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d she demanded, her blue eyes filled with fire.</p><p>\u201cThat, a cuisle, was a demonstration of why you\u2019re not coming tonight. As you so rightly pointed out, this isn\u2019t a game. This is war. And when vampires go to war, people die. A human wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d He zipped across the room faster than she could follow and hugged her gently. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve no desire to watch you die.\u201d</p><p>She tensed in the circle of his arms. \u201cLet go of me,\u201d she said tightly. She was clearly still angry at his demonstration, but that was all right. He\u2019d rather have her angry and alive, than dead the first time she tried to face off with a vampire on the field of battle.</p><p>Lucas released her with a shrug. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have believed me any other way, Kathryn.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her wrist, although he knew he hadn\u2019t hurt her. Even making his point, he\u2019d been exquisitely careful of her human vulnerabilities. Far more careful than his enemies would be.</p><p>\u201cFine. So I can\u2019t match you guys for muscle or speed,\u201d she admitted sullenly. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to a takedown like this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a takedown,\u201d Lucas interrupted implacably. \u201cThis is war, Kathryn. Call it what it is. Vampires fight to the death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she repeated irritably. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to war than hand-to-hand fighting. I can\u2019t match you there, I admit it, but I sure as hell can shoot. Give me a decent long gun and the high ground, and I\u2019ll be your overwatch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas opened his mouth to reject her offer, but stopped and eyed her curiously instead. \u201cYou can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lucas,\u201d she said patronizingly, \u201cI can do that. You\u2019re just like all those assholes at the Bureau who think women only know how to type or play hookers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas said slowly. \u201cI never thought that.\u201d He considered his options for a long moment. \u201cHave you ever killed anyone?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p> <p>Kathryn blinked. \u201cNo,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cEver shot a live human being?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce. Not with a rifle. It was up close. Small town. My partner and I were passing through, actually aiming for one town over in an investigation of what looked like a home-bred terror cell, when four assholes robbed a bank across the street from the coffee shop where we\u2019d stopped for lunch. Locals were outgunned and more than happy to accept our assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shot a bank robber?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOne of the four tried to make a break for it while his buddies went down, guns blazing. He was wearing a vest. Body armor,\u201d she clarified. \u201cI could have gone for a head shot and made it.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut he\u2019d already tossed his weapon, so I shot him in the leg instead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was good of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an FBI agent, Lucas. I try to apprehend suspects, not kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother reason you shouldn\u2019t come with us tonight. You can\u2019t shoot a vampire in the leg, Kathryn. It\u2019ll just piss him off.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him steadily, her jaw tight with anger, but her gaze thoughtful. \u201cWhat about you guys?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d Lucas replied, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill everyone you meet tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, not everyone,\u201d he joked, then sobered at her look of irritation. \u201cThe simple answer is yes. Any vampire who meets us in battle tonight will die. Some might surrender. Klemens is not an easy master, and not too many of his vampires will be sad to see him go. Unfortunately, the Sire/Child bond will drive even most of those who hate him to defend him. They\u2019ll die along with the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty brutal way of life.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what it means to be Vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be any humans at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on our side, but Klemens is expecting a visitor, a local mob boss who won\u2019t want to be seen. Klemens will probably permit the human to bring a few of his own guards with him, and they\u2019ll be human, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you wait until the humans are gone before attacking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not. That mob guy is my distraction. But you shouldn\u2019t worry too much about him. He and every one of his guards have probably killed, or ordered killed, more people than either one of us. Well, you anyway. I\u2019ve lived a long, bloody time.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stared up into his eyes, clearly trying to decide if he was joking about his own death count. He wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, in the tone of one who\u2019s made a decision. \u201cFind me some high ground. I can at least take down any guards this mob guy brings with him. I won\u2019t kill them unless I have to, but there are other ways of making certain a man stays down. Humans don\u2019t have your tolerance for pain. I\u2019ll also do my best to cover you against your vampire enemies. What\u2019s the best way to disable a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t disable a vampire,\u201d Lucas said bluntly. \u201cYou kill him. Hit the heart if you can. If not, aim for the head. Depending on the ammo, it might at least take him out of the game long enough for you to get away. Assuming you\u2019re as good as you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed, smiling at her look of surprise. \u201cI keep telling you, Kathryn. This is war. I won\u2019t turn away a weapon just because it comes wrapped in a very sexy package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA package you won\u2019t be unwrapping again anytime soon,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>Lucas laughed. \u201cTell Nick what kind of gear you need, and if we don\u2019t have it here, he\u2019ll have it waiting for you when we land. But you follow my orders, Kathryn. No questions asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s what we do at the FBI. We follow orders.\u201d She strode past him, slapping away the hand he reached out to her. \u201cI have to finish my shower. And I\u2019ll need those clothes.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn leaned over the private jet\u2019s conference table and studied the amazing array of photographs and schematics from Klemens\u2019s Chicago compound. They\u2019d taken off from Rapid City in Lucas\u2019s elegant private jet\u2014apparently it really was good to be the king. She doubted too many invading forces travelled in such luxury. They were no sooner in the air than Nick produced his files on Klemens and started discussing their battle plan for the night. She wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible for a private citizen to accumulate this kind of data, but she was probably being na\u00efve. In the era of Google Earth and the million other Internet sites where one could farm data, a first rate hacker could work miracles. And like everything else, when it came to hackers, there was apparently nothing but the best for Lucas.</p><p>\u201cTell me again how you know Klemens will be there tonight?\u201d Kathryn asked Nicholas.</p><p>He glanced at Lucas for permission, then said, \u201cThat\u2019s a bit of good luck on our part. Klemens has some unsavory human allies in Chicago, including Hector McKinney, who\u2019s one of the major crime bosses locally. That\u2019s who he\u2019s meeting tonight. Now, normally, you\u2019d expect that to mean increased security, but the thing is, Klemens is no fool. He doesn\u2019t trust his mobbed up ally and limits the number of soldiers he can bring to their meetings. Of course, McKinney doesn\u2019t trust Klemens either, so Klemens makes a big show of limiting his guards, too.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s mostly for show on Klemens\u2019s part. His vamps are all there, but they\u2019re out of sight, mostly in the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they just hang out in the basement for a few hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vampire\u2019s basement is not what you think, Agent Hunter. Especially not in the headquarters of a vampire lord. It will be fully built out, with every comfort. But it\u2019s still a basement, and it puts the majority of his guards in one place when we attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. What about this house?\u201d she asked, pointing to Klemens\u2019s nearest neighbor, near being a relative term in this case, given the size of the lots. Klemens\u2019s house was huge, with a lot size to match. His neighbor\u2019s house was just as big, but it had one big advantage from Kathryn\u2019s point of view\u2014it was three stories, where Klemens\u2019s was two and a dormer attic. That put the neighbor\u2019s roof at least ten feet above Klemens, and that was ten feet Kathryn could use to her advantage . . . assuming she could get there.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019ll be,\u201d Nick confirmed. \u201cThe owners are in Florida. They leave every year after Thanksgiving and don\u2019t return until late April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery year?\u201d Kathryn asked. \u201cHow long have you had this guy under surveillance?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shot another glance at Lucas, who was sitting next to her.</p><p>\u201cVampires live a long time,\u201d Lucas commented cryptically.</p><p>\u201cWhatever that means,\u201d she muttered. \u201cOkay, so the owners are in Florida, but a place this big, they must have housekeeping staff, gardeners, even guards. What about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe housekeeper only stops by twice a week. They do have a security system and a drive-by patrol that follows a regular schedule. Their company policy is to vary their patrols for obvious reasons, but they don\u2019t. Also, they literally drive by, so unless you\u2019re planning on standing on the roof and waving, there won\u2019t be anything for them to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ll have the place to myself, then.\u201d</p><p>Nick jerked his head in agreement. \u201cAs soon as we hit the ground in Chicago, you\u2019ll be going directly to Klemens\u2019s estate. One of my guys will drive you and help you get set up inside the house. Lucas and the rest of us will proceed more cautiously, but I need you up and ready to go by the time we get there. Once Lucas arrives at the estate, there won\u2019t be any time to climb over walls and sneak into houses. We\u2019ll have to attack immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize, Kathryn,\u201d Lucas drawled, \u201cthat you\u2019ll be breaking and entering the neighbor\u2019s house in order to get up on the roof. You being an FBI agent and all . . . \u201d</p><p>Kathryn scowled. She hadn\u2019t even considered that aspect of the night\u2019s activities, but Lucas was right, damn him. She was breaking the law just by walking into that house. She glanced up and saw the laughter in his eyes at her predicament.</p><p>\u201cSmart ass,\u201d she muttered. \u201cOkay, what am I doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what you suggested,\u201d Nick said simply. \u201cOverwatch. Klemens\u2019s estate is too big for us to cover every possible angle. But if you find the right spot, you should be able to see all but the side farthest from your position. If you see anything wonky, you let me know, and I\u2019ll direct the response.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded. This was good, and she could do it with a clear conscience since it wouldn\u2019t involve killing anyone. Hopefully.</p><p>Nick shifted his attention to Lucas. \u201cHow do you want us to proceed with the assault, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many warriors do we have total?\u201d Lucas asked pensively, studying the satellite image of Klemens\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cMinneapolis is fielding almost their full contingent. They\u2019re on the ground in Chicago by now. I also brought in fighters from Kansas and Missouri. They both left last night and arrived during daylight earlier today. With your guard, that gives you at least fifty seasoned warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Klemens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of his visitor, his visible numbers are limited. No more than ten in evidence, including his personal guard and the team on the gate. But he\u2019ll have at least another ten close by, most likely out of sight in the basement. It\u2019s possible that with the recent hostilities, he\u2019ll have upped that number, but I\u2019ve got eyes on the compound and expect to have a more accurate count by the time we land.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about the human guards?\u201d Kathryn interjected.</p><p>Nicholas gave her a blank look, as if he wasn\u2019t used to counting the humans as part of the threat. Which he probably wasn\u2019t. Lucas\u2019s earlier demonstration had stung\u2014in more ways than one\u2014but it had driven home very explicitly just how outclassed humans would be against even a small force of vampires.</p><p>\u201cYou said the mob guy would have his own guards?\u201d</p> <p>A look of comprehension crossed Nick\u2019s face, and he nodded. \u201cI expect no more than seven humans, including McKinney.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded. At least some of the human guards would probably remain outside to keep an eye on the gate, because they wouldn\u2019t trust the vamps to do it for them. So, they\u2019d be her first targets when Lucas gave the word. She frowned. What was the word anyway? She drew a breath to ask, but listened instead as Lucas began to detail the attack plan for the night.</p><p>\u201cThere are only two main entries,\u201d he began, \u201cso we\u2019ll go in front and back. You\u2019ll take out the gate guards first, Nick, but I don\u2019t want them dead. I don\u2019t want Klemens to know exactly what we\u2019re doing until we hit the house. Once we\u2019re through the gate, we\u2019ll have a small roving force around the house, but most of you will concentrate on the two major points of entry. You take one, and let Zelma take the other. As soon as you\u2019re set, I\u2019ll start projecting, and you hit the doors. I\u2019ll handle Klemens and whoever tries to block my path. The rest is up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Nicholas acknowledged with a sharp nod. \u201cI\u2019ll tell the others.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded his permission, and Nicholas made his way down the aisle and began conferring with the rest of the vampire force.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you mean, when you said you\u2019d \u2018start projecting\u2019?\u201d Kathryn asked.</p><p>Lucas had been studying the house schematic, but now he looked up at her with a smile that melted her heart. She wanted to resist him, but her face seemed to have a will of its own. She smiled back at him.</p><p>He took her hand, playing idly with her fingers as he answered her question. \u201cVampire lords have unusual talents, some of which are unique to the individual. One of my most useful talents is the ability to connect with other vampires on what I think of as a visceral level. It\u2019s not telepathy\u2014it\u2019s both more and less than that. For example, in battle, I can share my far greater strength with my warriors, boosting them both physically and psychologically. But the other side of this particular talent is that I can also drain away the strength and courage of my enemies, can make them believe their worst nightmare is upon them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there limits?\u201d Kathryn asked, somewhat amazed by what she was hearing. \u201cI mean, why do you need any warriors at all? Why not just zap Klemens and his troops from the get-go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Klemens is also a vampire lord. And once he realizes what I\u2019m doing, he\u2019ll eventually be able to block me from affecting his people. That will take time\u2014not much time, no more than a few minutes\u2014but it will be enough to give us a head start, because Klemens won\u2019t be able to block the initial assault, and the shock effect will be considerable. Especially for the newer or weaker among his vampires. They will be hit harder and recover more slowly, leaving them vulnerable when we crash the house.</p><p>\u201cBut, in the end, it will come down to a brutal, bloody war of vampire on vampire. At least until I destroy Klemens.\u201d</p> <p>Kathryn gave him a worried look. \u201cBut you can do that, right? I mean, you\u2019re stronger than he is.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shrugged. \u201cObviously, I believe I can. I\u2019m not suicidal. Why? Are you worried about me?\u201d</p><p>She was worried about him. But she wasn\u2019t going to admit it. Wasn\u2019t going to admit that he was important to her, that maybe she cared more about him than was healthy . . . for her anyway. Instead, she changed the subject by asking, \u201cWhat about my brother?\u201d</p><p>Lucas frowned, as if he knew she had feelings for him and was irritated that she wouldn\u2019t admit it. But then he couldn\u2019t possibly know that. So maybe it was just his considerable ego wanting to be stroked.</p><p>\u201cI told you, Kathryn. I don\u2019t think Klemens has your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said, but what if he does?\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed. \u201cIf he does, he\u2019s probably locked up somewhere. Probably the basement, which is the safest place for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure Nicholas tells\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNick has already briefed everyone on the possibility. We\u2019re not looking to kill any humans tonight, and certainly not anyone being held prisoner by Klemens.\u201d</p><p>He stroked an absent hand over Kathryn\u2019s tightly bound hair, tugging gently on her braid.</p><p>\u201cThe rifle meets your standards?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Kathryn nodded. Nick had managed to round up the rifle and scope she wanted before they left Minneapolis. While Nick and Lucas had gone straight to the airport to confer with the various groups of vampires heading out for the battle, she\u2019d gone to a gun range with the Minneapolis security chief to calibrate the weapon and adjust it to her specific requirements. But she didn\u2019t think Lucas was asking the question because he doubted the weaponry. He was trying to gauge her mood. He was concerned about how she\u2019d react once the killing started. He hadn\u2019t come right out and said anything, but he\u2019d hinted around on the subject all the way to the airport. She would have liked to reassure him, but she still wasn\u2019t certain how she felt about it herself. Nothing about tonight\u2019s engagement was legal, not according to human law. And her job was to represent that law, a job she took very seriously.</p><p>\u201cThe weapon\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYour guy had already calibrated it to a hundred yards. I just did some fine-tuning. When I look through that scope, it\u2019ll be like I\u2019m standing right next to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t shoot me.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn gave a breathy laugh and nudged his thigh next to hers. \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019m very clear about my targets before I pull the trigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be warm enough?\u201d</p><p>That made her turn her head and smile at him, erasing the somber note that had flavored their interaction since leaving Minneapolis. \u201cI\u2019m wearing two of your long-sleeved T-shirts over my own sweater, plus this nice, warm jacket Nick found for me. The leggings are mine, and they\u2019re winter-weight so perfectly adequate. I\u2019d rather have my tactical boots, but the running shoes and socks are warm enough, and at least they\u2019re black. Do I pass inspection?\u201d</p><p>Lucas tugged her braid again, harder this time. \u201cSmart ass. I\u2019m sending Mason with you to the neighbor\u2019s.\u201d She opened her mouth to protest, but he kept talking. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to stay. He\u2019ll just get you through the house and set up on the roof. The house is supposed to be empty, but there\u2019s no sense taking chances.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, businesslike.</p><p>\u201cTry not to shoot any of my guys, okay?\u201d</p><p>That was greeted with a sideways scowl. \u201cI told you, the scope is good, and I\u2019m very careful. Besides, according to you, my little gun won\u2019t do much damage to a vampire anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it hurts to get shot, even if it doesn\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn started to say more, wanting reassurance in triplicate that her brother wouldn\u2019t be hurt accidentally. But Nicholas rejoined them just as the plane angled left and entered a sweeping turn. She looked out the window and saw the lights of Chicago in the distance.</p><p>\u201cBuckle up, Kathryn,\u201d Lucas advised her. \u201cThis war is about to start.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Chicago, Illinois</p><p>When they arrived, theirs was the only jet, hell, the only plane, moving at the small airport. Lucas did a quick survey of the area as he followed several of his warriors down the stairs, then waited as Kathryn descended more carefully, the long rifle case visible over her right shoulder. Mason had tried to carry it for her, but she\u2019d declined firmly. Something about no one touching her weapon. So the big vampire had grabbed a couple of huge duffle bags, pointed out their vehicle and headed off to do his own equipment check.</p><p>With Lucas on the ground inside Klemens\u2019s territory, everything was in play and moving fast. He had grabbed Kathryn for a final hard and fast kiss when she reached the tarmac. \u201cYou stay up on that roof, until I tell you it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d she said, already securing her various pieces of gear on her body. \u201cI know the drill.\u201d She stopped suddenly and grabbed the front of his black shirt, which was just like the ones she\u2019d borrowed from him. \u201cTake care, Lucas,\u201d she said, meeting his gaze seriously. \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the other side.\u201d</p><p>Lucas frowned. The superstitious Irish street tough he\u2019d once been didn\u2019t like the sound of those final words, even though he knew it had a different meaning in the modern context. He watched her run toward the waiting SUV, watched Mason slam the cargo hatch, then climb into the driver\u2019s seat. Lucas tracked the taillights until they disappeared around the main terminal, then followed Nick to his own SUV and the many vampires waiting for his command.</p><p>The minute Lucas had landed in Chicago, Klemens had known he was here. He wouldn\u2019t know Lucas\u2019s precise location immediately, only that he\u2019d violated Klemens\u2019s territory. They were counting on the Chicago vampire lord\u2019s reaction being stalled somewhat by the presence of his human guest. The mob boss was too egotistical and too important to Klemens\u2019s operations to dismiss lightly, which meant Klemens would have to disengage diplomatically, and that would take time. Even if he sacrificed the mob boss and broke away quickly, it would still be a few minutes before he realized that Lucas was literally coming through his front gate.</p><p>As they raced down the midnight streets of Chicago, Nick kept up a steady murmur of conversation, checking in with the troops already in place around Klemens\u2019s compound\u2014close enough to keep watch on who came and went, but not so close that their presence would trigger any of Klemens\u2019s own security. War craft was much easier in this technological age than it had been when Lucas first started out with Raphael. Not that they\u2019d had to fight that many wars on this side of the Atlantic, not once the North American vampire community got a taste of what Raphael could do. There hadn\u2019t been that many vampires on this continent then, and those were mostly concentrated along the Atlantic corridor. But early on, Raphael had made it clear that his interest lay in the far West. As long as the vampires whose lands they passed through left him alone, he left them alone, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas still thought sometimes about how much easier his life back then would have been with a good pair of binoculars, and maybe a motion sensor or two.</p><p>He looked up as the SUV slowed, and Klemens\u2019s monstrosity of a house came into view. It looked more like an asylum than a home, but the Chicago vampire lord probably liked it that way.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas turned to Nick. \u201cEverything set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gate guards are down, and the entry teams are in place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe human, McKinney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill inside, my lord. One of his bodyguards was with Klemens\u2019s gate guards, and there\u2019s an empty SUV with the door open on the street. I\u2019m guessing the human guard was supposed to remain with the vehicle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the human dead?\u201d</p> <p>Nick nodded.</p><p>Lucas was glad Kathryn wasn\u2019t there to debate the issue. He took a moment to search out every one of his vampires, reaffirming their connection to him, offering strength and courage, as well as verifying their positions around the estate.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this, Nick.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn settled into position, making sure everything she needed was within reach. She and Mason had broken speed limits all the way across town, getting here in what had to be some sort of record. Once on the scene, they\u2019d set another record, making it into and through the house so quickly that she was sure someone had scouted it out ahead of time. The door they\u2019d entered through had been unlocked, and once inside, he\u2019d shown no hesitation. He\u2019d known exactly where to go and had literally carried her up the stairs, simply slinging an arm around her waist and moving. It had been exhilarating and terrifying all at once. Getting to the roof hadn\u2019t proved a problem either, since she\u2019d already decided she wasn\u2019t going to work from there. One look at the steeply pitched roof as they\u2019d pulled in behind the house, and she\u2019d known it wouldn\u2019t work. The only place she could have set up securely on a pitch like that would have been the peak, and that wouldn\u2019t have given her a good line of sight on Klemens\u2019s house next door. So, she\u2019d shooed Mason on his way, then set up in one of the third-story bedrooms instead. It was very nearly as high off the ground as the rooftop, and from the window, she had a nearly 180 degree view of Klemens\u2019s estate. She could see any movement along the front and back walls, as well as the side nearest her position.</p><p>The window was one of the older double-hung kind that operated on a pulley system to open straight upward. With the window wide open, she had arranged her sandbags on the broad sill, then set up a Sig SSG 3000, which was nearly identical to the one she used back at Quantico. Setting the rifle carefully on a table she\u2019d pulled over near the window, she lifted her binoculars and swept the scene in night vision mode. Lucas hadn\u2019t arrived yet, but the advance team vampires were on the move, taking up positions all around the house.</p><p>Raising her field, she checked out the building itself with the night vision off. There were a few lights inside, mostly concentrated on the second floor, a corner room on her side of the building. The curtains were drawn, but the occasional shadow of movement could be seen along the edge of one window. And that was it.</p> <p>She heard the roar of multiple engines and shifted her gaze just in time to see several big, black SUVs tear around the corner and come to a tire squealing stop in front of the wrought iron gate. Kathryn had a bad moment, fearing they\u2019d been discovered, but then the doors popped open, and she recognized several of Lucas\u2019s vampires as they poured through the gate and disappeared into the shadows around Klemens\u2019s huge compound.</p><p>She kept watching, her eye on the one SUV whose doors remained closed. The night grew abruptly silent. No truck engines, no quiet commands, not even the sound of traffic from nearby Lake Shore Drive. Suddenly, the doors opened, and Kathryn sucked in a breath as Lucas emerged to stand silently, his gaze sweeping from side-to-side, seeming to catalogue every detail down to the exact location of vampires Kathryn had long ago lost sight of. His head turned slowly, his gaze settling on the window where she sat watching, as if he could see her despite all the precautions she\u2019d taken to remain invisible. He shot her a quick grin, then sobered and turned back to face his enemy.</p><p>Lucas started forward, surrounded by his troops, and it was a terrifying sight. They were the warriors of their race, tall and bulky with muscle, their eyes glowing an eerie red, like the pits of hell. They were dressed completely in black combat gear, with not a telltale gleam of metal among them. Their weapons varied, some carrying long, wicked-looking knives, others a variety of guns, and some several of both. And all of them, Lucas included, were fully fanged, the white gleam of their teeth a stark contrast to their uniformly somber garb.</p><p>Of them all, only Lucas wore no weapons, not even a simple blade. But he was armed more lethally than any of them. The power he\u2019d told her about, the power of a vampire lord that she\u2019d only half believed in, was made real as he strode toward the house. A wind picked up out of nowhere, quickly escalating from a breeze that rattled the trees and sent dead leaves scurrying to escape his footsteps, to a raging storm that stalked the ground ahead of him, pounding the shutters and doors of Klemens\u2019s mansion, shattering the windows in their frames. The air, which had been so quiet and still only moments before, was now heavy with a sense of doom, as if the night itself understood that a great battle was about to take place.</p><p>Lucas strode forward, dressed in the same black combats as his soldiers, his long leather coat blowing behind him like a cape as the storm of his power spun before him. His black hair was slicked back from his handsome face, and his eyes burned the purest gold, casting a brilliant light on the path he cut across the manicured lawn, a beacon guiding his vampires onward. Kathryn shivered, and not from the cold.</p><p>Lucas was several yards from the porch when the door opened, only to be quickly torn from the hand of the man who stood there, bracing himself desperately against the storm of Lucas\u2019s power. A piercing white light smeared the frosted yard, giving it a dull, silver cast, and silhouetting two humans. Kathryn immediately dropped the binocs onto the pad of blankets she\u2019d scavenged and placed her eye to the rifle scope.</p><p>She centered on Lucas, then moved carefully toward the doorway, marking the two men, first one, then the other. The humans had gone old-school, each carrying an Uzi sub-machine gun, held gangster-style at the hip, with an automatic 9mm sidearm in the other hand. She assumed these were the mob boss McKinney\u2019s bodyguards, since Lucas had indicated they\u2019d be the only humans in the house.</p><p>One of the two took an aggressive step out onto the front porch, his hair and clothes blowing wildly as he shouted something that the wind tore from his mouth and tossed away. Lucas and his vampires kept coming, as if the man didn\u2019t exist. Kathryn swore silently and placed her crosshairs on the foolish human. Lucas might be nearly immortal, but only nearly. And she didn\u2019t care what he\u2019d said about bullets not taking down vampires. Enough bullets could do a lot of damage, and if that guard turned his Uzi on Lucas, it would tear him apart. She sank into her sniper space, her mind and sight riveted to the events unfolding far below, every detail as clear as if she stood two feet away. Her entire world became the small circle of space revealed by her scope. She saw the guard\u2019s arm tense as he lifted the gun fractionally, saw him snug the weapon closer to his hip to stabilize it, saw his finger twitch.</p> <p>She blew out a breath, began her slow squeeze of the trigger . . . and froze as her target disappeared. Moving so fast they\u2019d been nothing but a dark blur across the face of her scope, Lucas\u2019s vampires had taken the two human guards down. One moment the two men were getting ready to fire, and the next the doorway was empty, and there were two bodies lying in a huddle on the cold ground. She swallowed hard as one of Lucas\u2019s vampires dragged a body up off the ground and sank his teeth into the man\u2019s throat, drinking deeply before tossing him aside. She brought up the binocs and took a look. The man was on his back, his head at an unnatural angle, his throat torn out. If he hadn\u2019t been dead before, he was now, and she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about that. The human was a gangster and probably a killer, but . . .</p><p>But nothing, Kathryn, she reminded herself. Lucas had warned her that this was war. And that guard down there would have happily killed every one of the invading vampires, including Lucas, if he\u2019d had the chance. After all, hadn\u2019t she been preparing to do exactly the same thing? If Lucas\u2019s vampire hadn\u2019t done it first, she would have shot him before he could kill Lucas, and she would have shot to kill, too. But seeing the way he died, seeing him lying there with his throat torn out . . . It bothered her. She couldn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>She jolted as something like static electricity buzzed over her skin, making the fine hairs on her arms stiffen. Far below, Lucas had lifted his arms as if to embrace the mansion and everyone in it. Then the wind died, and the night went dark and silent as every light in the house, every street light, every distant night light in the neighborhood was doused in the space of a heartbeat.</p><p>Kathryn grabbed the night vision binoculars, her fingers trembling as she struggled to hold the lenses steadily enough to see. But there was nothing, only blackness where Lucas had been standing.</p><p>She had lowered the binocs, when a flash of movement where there hadn\u2019t been any before made her pull away from her desperate search near the front door. She lifted the lenses again and scanned the side of the house, certain she\u2019d seen something move. It had been close to the ground, an anomaly caught in her peripheral vision, not an animal, but there . . . something\u2014a window maybe\u2014was being pushed out from the house. It was little more than a slightly less dark patch of wall, but it was definite movement and, oh, yeah, lots of it.</p><p>Kathryn touched the small radio bud in her ear. \u201cNick.\u201d It was only a few seconds before he responded, but it seemed like forever as she watched figures begin to emerge from what was clearly a basement exit. It had to be Klemens\u2019s vampires, the ones Nick had said would be hiding from the human visitor, McKinney.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got, Hunter?\u201d Nick\u2019s voice was a welcome noise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLots of movement, my side of the house. I think it\u2019s a basement exit of some\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Nick interrupted, and then he was gone.</p><p>Kathryn dropped the binocs and put her eye to her scope instead. These were almost certainly Klemens\u2019s vampires. Lucas had insisted she wouldn\u2019t be able to kill them with her rifle, but he\u2019d probably never seen what a .50 caliber round could do. A shot to the head would split a person\u2019s skull right down the middle like Play-Doh and pulverize the brain. Not even a vampire could survive that. But she hadn\u2019t particularly wanted to kill anyone tonight, so she\u2019d gone with Federal Match Grade .308 Remington 168-grain slugs instead. Sighting on the emerging vampires, she didn\u2019t bother with detailed target selection. She just moved the crosshairs from one lump of darkness to the next and pulled the trigger. The first couple howled in surprise as the bullets tore into them. As Lucas had said, it obviously hurt like hell, and it definitely slowed them down. They spun in circles, searching for the shooter, but she just kept firing, and they were soon more preoccupied with evading her bullets than figuring out where they were coming from.</p> <p>\u201cMy guys are on scene, Hunter,\u201d Nick warned urgently.</p><p>Kathryn stopped firing and switched to binocs as the first of Lucas\u2019s vampires engaged their enemy. If she\u2019d thought the death of the human guard on the front porch had been violent, this took it to a whole new level. There was no posturing among the vamps, no jockeying for position, they just stepped in and started ripping each other apart. Knives, fangs, hands curved into claws as they slashed and tore at each other. Heads were ripped from bodies, then tossed aside, the bodies poofing to dust before her eyes. Another vampire was run through with a wicked knife. He grabbed his chest and laughed, until Lucas\u2019s warrior stabbed him a second time, straight through the heart. Then he, too, became nothing more than a pile of dust.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s heart was hammering, adrenaline setting her nerves on a knife\u2019s edge as she watched something she knew few humans would ever see. In moments, there was no one left at the basement window but Lucas\u2019s vamps. And not a dead body in sight.</p><p>\u201cAll clear, Hunter,\u201d Nick informed her. \u201cGood work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger,\u201d she managed, her hand shaking as it dropped away from her ear. Dust. Vampires were hard to kill, but they really did turn to dust when it happened. Her bosses at the FBI would be thrilled with the intel she could bring them from this night\u2019s activities. She might even get a promotion out of it, maybe something that would get her out of the office and back into the field again. She placed a hand over her pounding heart and thought about loyalties. She didn\u2019t know exactly where hers lay anymore. It was a troubling thought.</p> <p>Someone screamed from deep within the house. Then, as if that first scream had freed them all from a spell of silence, the night was filled with the sounds of battle. It was the stuff of nightmares, and all Kathryn could think was that Lucas was in there somewhere, and she had no idea what was happening. Or whether she\u2019d ever see him alive again.</p><p>Lucas stood before his enemy\u2019s front door, every ounce of power and knowledge he possessed focused on one thing, spreading fear and confusion among Klemens\u2019s vampires. Right up until the moment he\u2019d stepped out of the SUV at Klemens\u2019s gate, he\u2019d been using his strength to stop his rival vampire lord from pinpointing his presence. But this close, that was futile. His power signature would be far too strong, and Klemens was far too wily. The minute they\u2019d arrived at the estate, even as he was verifying the location of his warriors around it, and Kathryn, too, in her perch high above the battle, he\u2019d been using his unique talent to whisper in the ears of Klemens\u2019s warriors, warning them of invaders sneaking around the corner on a breath of wind, of death tapping their shoulders and snatching away their courage. Their terror fed his power, as rich and sweet as blood from the vein. He didn\u2019t relish this part of his talent, this ability to draw strength from the fear of others. But this was war, and if it came down to a choice of who would die this night, he\u2019d use every talent he possessed to make certain it was Klemens and his vampires who bit the big one before the next sunrise.</p><p>Lucas spared a thread of power to search for his enemy, the delicate probe slipping through the cracks to search every corner of the eyesore of a house before him. Very soon, he\u2019d have to suck his power back into himself and leave the larger battle to his warriors, because somewhere in there, Klemens was waiting. No matter how many of the Chicago vampires Lucas\u2019s fighters destroyed, the real battle, the only one that really counted, was the showdown between the two vampire lords.</p><p>The front door opened only to be torn from its hinges by the raging wind of Lucas\u2019s power. He squinted against the sudden shaft of white light as two heavily armed humans staggered into the opening. McKinney\u2019s guards, he assumed, and they were getting ready to fire. Several of Lucas\u2019s vampires were suddenly in front of him, guarding him with their bodies while two of their number made the dash across the frost-covered lawn and took down the humans before they even managed to bring their weapons to a full firing position. The two men screamed, their voices cut off as their necks were snapped. One of Lucas\u2019s vampires fed briefly, ripping out the human\u2019s throat as his heart beat its final tattoo. But the feeding was more symbolic than anything else\u2014a predator claiming his victory before tossing the limp body aside.</p><p>Aggravated by the bright light, which had no place in a vampire\u2019s residence, Lucas reached out and fried the local power grid. The entire neighborhood sank into blessed darkness. Next to him, Nick stiffened to attention, then rapidly deployed several warriors to one side of the house. Lucas heard the repeated pop of several gunshots and glanced up at the neighboring house. A muzzle flash confirmed Kathryn\u2019s location, and he grinned. So, she got to shoot her rifle after all. And she didn\u2019t seem to be having any second thoughts about it, either. Maybe he\u2019d make a warrior of her yet.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the black hole of a front entry. He tugged on the thread of his power and found Klemens.</p> <p>You should have killed me when you had the chance, he thought mockingly, and let the thought carry to the second story where Klemens waited.</p><p>Tonight will do just as well, you mick scum. Klemens\u2019s mental voice was filled with venom.</p><p>Lucas almost laughed at the petty slur and thought the Chicago vampire must really be worried if he was resorting to such superficial insults. Lucas sent one final nightmare speeding through the enormous mansion, his blood pumping with adrenaline as a flood of terror rushed back to him. He soaked it in, then walked through the front door and up the stairs.</p><p>The battle raged as he made his way through the house, his warriors moving silently around him, lethal wraiths who brought permanent death wherever they went. The first screams were the final cries of vampires caught by surprise, still muffled by the blanket of darkness he\u2019d dropped over the house. But as he climbed the stairs, gathering his power back into himself for the final battle, the noise level increased. Vampires howled in agony and roared in triumph. Bodies crashed through walls and tumbled over balconies. Klemens\u2019s people fought back viciously, knowing what was at stake, recognizing the depth of their danger. Lucas had no doubt they were being goaded to a desperate defense by their master, who remained tucked away in his place of power, waiting for Lucas, like a fat spider in its web.</p><p>Lucas moved swiftly down the second floor corridor, all alone now. Even Nicholas had been drawn away into the frenzied battle raging all around him. Lucas moved with purpose, though he\u2019d never been in this house before, Klemens\u2019s presence drawing him as surely as a red arrow flashing in the dark.</p><p>He found the Chicago vampire lord in an old-fashioned trophy room. Animal heads were mounted on the walls, and a collection of ancient weapons hung over the huge fireplace where glowing embers revealed the dying light of a recent fire. The room reeked of fresh blood, and Lucas knew he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about killing Hector McKinney. Klemens had slaughtered the crime boss, draining him dry to fuel the contest to come.</p><p>Klemens appeared out of the shadows, standing from behind the desk. Blood, still warm from McKinney\u2019s beating heart, clung to Klemens\u2019s clothing and dripped from his fangs. He grinned at Lucas, his hands still curved into the claws that had ripped his former ally to shreds.</p><p>\u201cCome to die at last, Lucas?\u201d</p> <p>Lucas smiled easily, flashing his own fangs as he prepared for the fight of his life. Klemens was powerful, but young, as vampires go. He was strong, but inexperienced, wielding his power like a cudgel. He was a gorilla with a big club. Lucas, on the other hand, had power and experience. His was a more refined fighting style, death by a thousand cuts. He was going to savor every single slice of Klemens\u2019s flesh before he killed him.</p><p>Lucas lashed out without warning, carving into the big femoral artery of Klemens\u2019s left leg, then immediately snatching his power back into a tight shield around himself. Klemens howled at the unexpected attack and fought back exactly as Lucas had expected he would. A thundering stroke of power slammed against Lucas\u2019s shields, a tactic that would have driven him to his knees if he hadn\u2019t been prepared for it. But Lucas didn\u2019t waste time analyzing his enemy\u2019s strategy. Instead, he responded immediately, slashing at Klemens left and right, over and over again, his power like a many-tailed whip whose barbed ends cut into his enemy from every direction, from high and low. Klemens roared as he struggled to protect himself from Lucas\u2019s unconventional attack. He flung out a hand, and Lucas staggered. It was like a huge boulder slamming against his shields, but though they bowed under the assault, they never broke. And like his shields, Lucas never faltered. He snarled his hatred as he sliced the flesh from Klemens\u2019s bones, severing arteries and veins, driving the Chicago lord to his knees as his legs gave way, unable to support him.</p><p>Klemens gave a deep-throated howl of rage and swept his arms outward. Lucas recoiled as every animal head mounted on the walls came flying toward him at once, physically striking his shields from all sides. It was a desperate move on Klemens\u2019s part, meant to distract more than injure, and it nearly worked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas ducked as a fourteen-point stag head flew at his face, and Klemens attacked from where he knelt, wielding his power just like the club Lucas had imagined. It beat against Lucas\u2019s shields from all sides, pounding until Lucas could hear the concussion of air against his shields, a deep resonance like the clapper on a huge bell. And Lucas stood in the middle of it all.</p><p>He contracted his shields tightly around himself, making them more secure, even as it drew the blows from Klemens\u2019s attack closer to his physical body. But that didn\u2019t matter. As long as his shields held, even an inch of protection was enough. From within the cocoon of his power, Lucas studied his enemy. Klemens was bleeding from everywhere, blood pooling around him where he knelt, his flesh hanging in gory strips that mingled with the shreds of his clothing. Lucas changed his attack, no longer wielding a many-barbed whip, but a whippet-thin rapier instead. A sharp needle of power aimed directly at Klemens\u2019s heart.</p><p>He thrust it outward, felt it penetrate Klemens\u2019s shields, felt the vampire lord\u2019s shock as it pierced his flesh and burrowed into his heart. Lucas\u2019s lips curved into a bare smile of victory as he flicked the rapier once, cleaving Klemens\u2019s heart in mid-beat, slicing it in two as it staggered within his chest.</p> <p>Klemens howled and dropped his shields, scrabbling at his bloody chest, desperately trying to gather the dregs of his power, to heal the unhealable. Lucas was all but certain Klemens would not succeed, but he didn\u2019t take any chances. He slashed at the unprotected vampire lord, carving into his flesh and bones until his heart finally surrendered the fight. Klemens died, his final scream of denial echoing in the night long after his body had turned to dust.</p><p>Lucas had the space of a heartbeat to savor his victory, a mingling of relief and triumph as he reached out to his vampires, touching each one, affirming their link, reassuring them that their master still lived, still held their lives securely in his power. Then the world collapsed, and he fell to his knees, overwhelmed by the weight of Klemens\u2019s subjects, the thousands of vampires suddenly cast adrift by their master\u2019s death, crying out in fear and desperation, searching for someone to hold them together, to keep their hearts beating, their walls secure against enemies.</p><p>Lucas bowed beneath their demands, his back bent nearly to the floor as he struggled to impose order, to hold onto his own people and still protect those who had belonged to Klemens. Raphael had warned him of this when they\u2019d first discussed the need to confront the Chicago vampire lord. When Lucas had insisted he had no desire to rule the MidwesternTerritory along with his own.</p><p>Lucas was Vampire, and all that it meant. He was aggressive, territorial, possessive and downright feral when forced into it. But as Raphael had observed with some despair on more than one occasion, Lucas was at heart a cheerful soul, a playboy who enjoyed life more than conquest.</p><p>So, Raphael had schooled Lucas on how to take Klemens\u2019s people under his wing, how to shuffle them safely aside, holding their lives securely until a new lord arose in the aftermath. The territory would be thrown open to all comers. Dominance battles would be fought, and some contenders would die, but eventually a new lord would emerge, and Lucas would be rid of this extra burden.</p> <p>Lucas sucked in a long breath as the voices died down at last, the drain on his strength diminishing until it was no more than an irritating scrape against his nerves.</p><p>\u201cSire?\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked up into Nicholas\u2019s concerned face. \u201cWe did it, Nick. Ding dong, the bastard\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed and offered his Sire a hand up. Lucas took it gratefully. He trusted Nick, and he was exhausted. \u201cAny problems I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone, my lord. Klemens\u2019s people were wholly unprepared. Several tried to sneak out through a basement window, though whether their intent was to run away or defend their Sire, I don\u2019t know. In any event, Kathryn gave us warning and kept them pinned down until we got there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the shots. Is she\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUninjured, my lord. I\u2019ve asked her to remain up there until we clear the house.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave his lieutenant a quizzical look. There was no reason for Kathryn to remain on watch, and no danger for her here in the house. Nicholas knew this as well as he did.</p><p>\u201cI have people searching the house for survivors . . . or victims,\u201d Nick admitted. \u201cI agree with you that her brother was likely never here, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t believe it until she sees for herself,\u201d Lucas said, as understanding dawned. \u201cRight. Okay, get some of our daylight guards here as soon as possible. I want this house secured for at least the next few days. After that\u2014\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve no desire to live here, but I suppose the next lord might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we have to stay here until the new lord is figured out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas grimaced in agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve already put in the call to Minneapolis HQ. Daylight security will be on station before dawn. Shall I radio Kathryn and tell her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d Kathryn\u2019s voice wafted up the staircase.</p> <p>\u201cToo late,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>Kathryn had scrambled to put away her gear and get over to Klemens\u2019s house next door. Or rather, what used to be Klemens\u2019s house. Nick had radioed to let her know they were cleaning up and to assure her that Lucas and everyone else had survived the battle. He\u2019d asked her to remain where she was, in case anyone tried to make a break for it. She\u2019d done as he asked until she\u2019d spotted several of Lucas\u2019s vampires hanging around in the yard, slapping each other on the back in victory. She suspected Nick was trying to keep her away from the house for some reason, and that reason could only have one name. Daniel.</p><p>Her heart had wanted her to race over there to see what they\u2019d found, but her brain had insisted she make sure there was no trace of her presence left in this house before she left. So she\u2019d sacrificed the few minutes it took to put the furniture back where she\u2019d found it and tossed the two heavy sand bags out the window. She watched where they landed so she could pick them up later, rather than lug them down the stairs. She then closed the window and drew the curtains halfway, just as they\u2019d been when she arrived. She took a final look around the small bedroom, grabbed the rifle case and raced downstairs and out the back door, locking it behind her, making a mental note that someone would have to come by later and set the alarm.</p><p>Kathryn deposited her rifle case in the cargo compartment of one of the SUVs idling just outside Klemens\u2019s house. The trucks had been pulled through the gates and now stood near the front porch. There was no one around, so she walked into the house via the gaping doorway and stood for a moment, listening. The lower level of the house was mostly unlit, but there was enough moonlight that she could see silhouettes of furniture to either side of where she stood. The hallway to the right had a dim light shining out of it, and she could hear a low rumble that made her think there was an emergency generator somewhere, probably the kitchens. In front of her was a wide staircase that went straight up to a second floor mezzanine that fed into closed hallways on either side.</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d she called and started up. Lucas appeared on the mezzanine before she\u2019d climbed more than a few stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come up,\u201d he called down. \u201cI\u2019ll come to you.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn studied him as he descended the stairs, moving with his usual lethal grace, and something more. He looked . . . victorious. It was hard to describe. He was as gorgeous as ever, his black hair attractively mussed, his big body encased in black leather, hazel eyes glittering with gold. But, then, it wasn\u2019t so much his physical appearance that was different. It was an air about him, as if he were surrounded by an invisible nimbus of power.</p><p>He came even with her. \u201cDo I look that bad?\u201d he half-joked, glancing down at himself.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cJust different somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow,\u201d he agreed with irritating vagueness.</p><p>\u201cKlemens?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDusted, along with most of his cohorts.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stared up at him. She hadn\u2019t counted, but there\u2019d been a lot of vampires coming out of that basement window, and in a house this size, probably more that she\u2019d never seen. They were people, just like Lucas and Nick and the others. And just like that they were dead and . . . dusted. She\u2019d seen what happened when a vampire died.</p><p>\u201cKathryn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is this . . . usual? I mean, how often do you guys fight each other to the death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Agent Hunter. It doesn\u2019t happen that often, and it doesn\u2019t concern you anyway. We choose our path within vampire society, and none of those who died here had to be fighters. They could have been shop owners, lawyers, plumbers, whatever they wanted, and been perfectly safe from all of this. It\u2019s like your own military. It\u2019s all volunteer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it any less of a loss when they die,\u201d Kathryn snapped back at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Lucas countered tightly. \u201cAnd there are those, myself included, who will mourn the unnecessary death of every one of these vampires. But my responsibility is to the living, to all of those vampires Klemens held in his power, vampires who would have died in an instant if I hadn\u2019t stepped up to protect them. So I don\u2019t need your judgment, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas.\u201d She grabbed his arm when he would have gone past her down the stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>He stopped a step below her and met her gaze, their eyes even. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose you did. It\u2019s late, Kathryn. It\u2019s been a long night, and I won\u2019t sleep in this house. We\u2019re going back to the St. Paul condo. Are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Daniel?\u201d she asked urgently.</p><p>Lucas sighed, and she heard the exhaustion in that simple breath. \u201cYour brother isn\u2019t here,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cMy vampires have searched every foot of this grotesque house. There is no one alive within these walls, other than my own people. And there are no fresh graves, either,\u201d he added, before she could voice that horrible possibility. It was cruel of him to say it, but she couldn\u2019t deny she\u2019d had the same thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow can you know that?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOne, Klemens is . . . was too smart to bury victims on his home turf, much less in his own lair. Two, vampires have an incredibly keen sense of smell, especially when it comes to blood and death. He\u2019s not here, Kathryn.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn cast a desperate look around the dark mansion. \u201cI need to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo see for yourself,\u201d Lucas finished for her. \u201cI understand. I have a contingent of daylight guards coming in to secure the house. They\u2019ll help, if you\u2019d like, and they\u2019ll know how to get in touch with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She held onto his arm, unsure what to do, but not wanting him to leave angry with her. \u201cLucas . . .\u201d</p><p>He smiled and leaned forward to give her a lingering kiss. \u201cI still love you, Katie mine. We\u2019ll be flying back to South Dakota after sunset tonight. Let me know what you want to do.\u201d He glanced up the stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Nick.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stood aside as Nicholas clambered past her to follow Lucas. She looked around and spied a light switch near the front door. Walking over to it, she flicked all of the switches, but nothing happened. Whatever Lucas had done in dousing the lights earlier must have damaged the grid. And it would probably be hours before the emergency crews got out here to fix whatever he\u2019d broken. She sighed and schlepped back outside for the big flashlight in her duffle. She believed Lucas when he said her brother wasn\u2019t here. Or at least she believed he believed it. But she couldn\u2019t leave this place without seeing for herself, without searching for any evidence that Dan had been here in the past.</p><p>And after that . . . She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do. Because if Alex had never had Daniel, if Klemens had never taken him away, then where was he?</p> <p>.Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Twin Cities, Minnesota</p><p>Kathryn stumbled wearily through the door of the rooms Lucas had set aside for her in his St. Paul headquarters. It was nearly dark, and she knew Lucas would be waking soon, but she couldn\u2019t face him. Not yet. She was grateful beyond belief that he\u2019d made this condo available to her, that her luggage was here with her clothes, her toiletries. She needed a shower. She needed her own soap, her shampoo, her own fresh clothes. She needed something normal and good after spending too many hours searching every room, every closet, every cabinet and drawer of Klemens\u2019s house of horrors. His filth clung to her skin, coated her hair, and rooted beneath her fingernails. If there was a perversity that the vampire lord hadn\u2019t been into, she hadn\u2019t found it. He had entire libraries filled with books, computer files, and videos of the very worst kind, pedophilia, snuff films, sexual bondage and sado-masochism\u2014and not the consensual kind, either. And then there had been his private dungeon, the place where he\u2019d indulged his hobbies on a more personal level. Lucas might have been right about the absence of bodies\u2014she\u2019d found nothing to contradict him\u2014but men and women had definitely died in that house.</p><p>She drew a deep breath of clean air and stripped down to her skin, then searched the cupboards until she found a box of garbage bags beneath the sink. Every piece of clothing she wore went into a bag, from the coated rubber band in her hair on down, including her sweater and the two shirts she\u2019d borrowed from Lucas, even her athletic shoes and socks. She tied off that bag, then shoved it into a second bag and secured that one just as tightly. Her first instinct was to throw it all away, but she might change her mind later, so for now she simply dropped it in a corner near the door and dragged herself into the bathroom.</p><p>Reaching into the shower stall, she turned the hot water on full blast, then leaned wearily over the sink, bracing herself on her arms. She avoided looking in the mirror, glad when the room filled with steam, fogging the glass enough that she couldn\u2019t see anything. She felt tainted by what she\u2019d found, and she wondered if she\u2019d ever feel clean again. Turning back toward the shower, she opened the door and nearly stepped under the spray without checking first. Something registered on her tired brain at the last minute, and she put out a hand, jerking it back when the dangerously hot water hit her fingers. Heart pounding, she adjusted the water to just under boiling, then closed the door behind her and stood, letting the water wash over her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she was crying until the shower door opened and Lucas put his arms around her, holding her while she wept silently, her tears hot against his broad chest, her body trembling with emotion while he held her steady.</p> <p>\u201cAh, Katie. We\u2019ll find your brother. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn couldn\u2019t answer at first, couldn\u2019t find the breath to do anything but cry. But when she was all cried out, her voice scratchy from her tears, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just Daniel. It\u2019s that horrible place. Did you know that he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew some of it. We vampire lords don\u2019t exactly socialize with one another, so I\u2019d never been to his house before. But I knew Klemens\u2019s preferences tended toward . . . degradation, and my people briefed me on what they found before we left. I\u2019m sorry you had to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, sniffing loudly, \u201cI\u2019ve met some of the agents who work on the child pornography task force, and they\u2019ve hinted at the sorts of things they deal with. But seeing that awful collection of Klemens\u2019s today . . . I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Lucas agreed. \u201cI\u2019m only sorry he had to take so many with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they lived there, too. They must have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them probably shared his tastes, but not all. The bond between a vampire and his children is strong, Kathryn. Even many of those who hated him would have been unable to defy him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sorry for them, but not the rest.\u201d</p> <p>She felt him kiss the top of her head and tried to pull away. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019m filthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to do something about that then,\u201d he drawled, his Irish lilt making itself heard.</p><p>He reached behind her and snapped open a plastic container, sniffing the contents before drizzling it over her head.</p><p>\u201cI can do that, you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me, a cuisle. Just relax.\u201d</p><p>He turned her around until her back was to his chest, his big body protecting her from the pounding water. His strong fingers massaged her scalp, scenting the steamy shower stall with the fresh smell of her shampoo, filling her nostrils with the cleansing scent instead of the greasy miasma of Klemens\u2019s lair. She leaned her head back and let him work, relishing the elegant flow of his muscles, the solid strength of his body behind her. A wave of sadness brought fresh tears to her eyes. She knew this couldn\u2019t last. Before too long, she\u2019d have to head back to Virginia, to her job and her life there. She\u2019d have to leave all of this\u2014leave Lucas\u2014behind. Theirs was an impossible relationship. Thousands of miles separated their lives, and that was only distance. She worked for the FBI, and he was a damn vampire lord. How could that ever work between them? She couldn\u2019t change who she was any more than Lucas could stop being a vampire. She bent her head, so Lucas wouldn\u2019t see the tears. She never cried, and now suddenly, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s fingers stilled, and she thought he\u2019d sensed somehow that she was crying, but then he slid his hands to her shoulders and said, \u201cPrepare to rinse.\u201d He turned her slowly into the stream of water, tipping her head forward with a gentle pressure. Once the shampoo was gone, he massaged conditioner in\u2014she\u2019d fallen hopelessly in love with a man who appreciated the need for conditioner.</p><p>Her thoughts skidded to a halt. Love? She couldn\u2019t love Lucas Donlon for all the reasons she\u2019d already told herself.</p><p>\u201cRelax, a cuisle,\u201d he repeated, murmuring against her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Take care of her? What did he mean by that? She didn\u2019t need anyone to take care of\u2014 Oh.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s clever hands were rubbing shower gel all the way down her back, over her shoulders and along her arms. He lifted each of her hands separately, washing between her fingers, massaging her fingernails and cuticles, scrubbing away every last bit of Klemens\u2019s filth. He moved down to her butt and gave a teasing squeeze before sliding his fingers between her cheeks and lower, slipping one finger into her anus before gliding lower to barely crease her pussy.</p><p>Kathryn moaned softly and let her head fall back onto his shoulder. She turned her head and met his mouth. His lips and skin were hot from the shower, but his mouth when she swirled her tongue around was cool and delicious. He sucked hard, pulling her tongue deeper into his mouth before releasing her to trail kisses down her neck to her shoulder where he bit gently on the tender bone of her clavicle.</p><p>She felt the cold slide of her shower gel as he dribbled it over her chest, and then the warm caress of his hands, cupping her breasts, teasing her nipples into hard pebbles of sensation as his hands moved lower. He washed her ribs, her abdomen and lower still until he dipped his fingers between the folds of her sex, tantalizing her with toying brushes over and around her clit, stroking the edges of her vagina while denying her even the briefest glide of his fingers into her hungry pussy. Kathryn placed her hand over his, pushing his hand lower, deeper, demanding what she wanted.</p><p>But Lucas only chuckled and removed his hand from between her thighs and turned her to face him again. Squeezing more gel onto his hands, he knelt to wash her legs, from her hips to her toes, carefully washing and massaging each leg while Kathryn fisted her fingers in his wet hair, achingly aware of his mouth so close to the center of her desire. She nearly screamed when his tongue suddenly scraped a slow path along her slit, sweeping up the moisture of her arousal before stroking against her clit. His lips closed over that sensitive nub, and Kathryn thought she\u2019d faint as he sucked hard, pulling the swollen pearl between his lips, then letting it slide out again, over and over until it was engorged with blood, until every nerve in Kathryn\u2019s body was screaming for release. She squeezed her breasts, pinching her nipples ruthlessly, desperate to assuage some of the pressure, some of the need, that was overwhelming her senses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas reached behind her to cup her ass in his powerful hands, holding her in place as he tormented her, making her feel things she\u2019d never felt with anyone, making her want things she knew were impossible. She opened her mouth to beg him to stop, or maybe to keep going forever. She didn\u2019t know what she would have said, because at that moment, Lucas closed his teeth over her clit and bit down. She did scream then, as an orgasm stormed through her body like lightning, igniting every nerve ending, firing every muscle, and making every hair on her body stiffen as waves of ecstasy cascaded over her body until she could barely stand. Kathryn tugged on Lucas\u2019s hair, crying out her pleasure until the orgasm stole even her breath, and all she could do was gasp his name.</p><p>Lucas gave her pussy a final stroke of his tongue, his eyes glowing gold as he looked up at her and licked his lips, visibly savoring the blood he\u2019d drawn from her clit. He stood abruptly, his hard-muscled body sliding over hers as he pressed her against the wall of the shower. She could feel the solid length of his arousal as she lifted her arms around his neck. He gripped her thigh and wrapped her leg around his hip, lifting her higher until he could slide his cock into her eager wetness. Kathryn groaned and closed her eyes, overwhelmed with the velvet over marble sensation of his thick penis pushing into her.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Kathryn,\u201d Lucas demanded, his voice low and rough.</p> <p>Kathryn lifted passion-heavy lids and met his golden stare. He held her gaze as he began to fuck her, one hand cupped under her ass, the other pressed against the tile wall as he slid in and out with long, slow movements, letting her feel every inch of his cock as he plunged through her still trembling sheath, his pelvis grinding against her exquisitely aroused clit with every stroke. Kathryn licked her lips, sweat dripping down her face as the hot water continued to pound around them. Lucas\u2019s gaze dropped briefly to her mouth, then flashed back to her eyes, his expression growing suddenly more intent as his movements became more urgent. His ass flexed harder beneath the leg she had wrapped around his hip, and he began to pound himself into her, shoving deeper with every stroke, his flesh slapping hers wetly.</p><p>Lucas growled, and Kathryn\u2019s eyes widened as his fangs emerged. His gaze took on a predatory gleam, as he nipped briefly at her lips and jaw, before finally licking the skin of her neck, his tongue a cool rasp against the big vein beneath her ear. Her heart was hammering, her breath coming in short gasps, when the smooth glide of his fangs replaced his tongue. He lifted his head slightly and bit into her vein.</p><p>And then she was crying helplessly as a second orgasm claimed her body, fisting her inner muscles around his cock, turning her blood to molten lava as it rolled through her veins, carrying a pleasure that was nearly too much for her to bear all at once. Her leg spasmed around his hips, her heel digging into his muscled ass as her sex clamped tight, refusing to release him, even as some part of Kathryn was begging for it to stop. Her chest tightened with an emotion she didn\u2019t want to acknowledge, didn\u2019t want to feel, but it was too late. Too late.</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d she whispered, as Lucas sagged against her finally, both of them spent and trembling.</p><p>\u201cToo late for what, a cuisle?\u201d he whispered breathlessly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she lied. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was saying.\u201d</p><p>Lucas reached behind him and unwrapped her leg, lowering her carefully until both of her feet hit the tiled floor.</p><p>\u201cShall I wash you off?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn slapped his hands away and forced a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve done quite enough washing for one night. Take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun at all,\u201d he muttered as he soaped and rinsed himself quickly. When he finished, he leaned in for a last soft and hungry kiss, whispering something against her ear before he pulled away and left her in the shower to finish alone. The words were Irish, so she could pretend she didn\u2019t hear, didn\u2019t know what they meant, but the truth was . . . She didn\u2019t need to know the actual meaning of the words, because it was there in the way he said it, in the soft brush of his lips against her ear, the roll of the syllables off his tongue. He loved her, and it was breaking her heart.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p> <p>Lucas was just disconnecting a call with Nick when Kathryn finally emerged from the bedroom, looking all rosy and well-satisfied. He credited himself with both of those things. She\u2019d been far from either when he\u2019d wakened earlier this evening. He\u2019d known she was downstairs even before he woke. The blood he\u2019d taken from her over the past few days had sung to him of her presence, letting him feel her sadness and more.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d he asked unnecessarily.</p><p>She crossed to him and cupped his cheek in one hand as she kissed him. \u201cThanks to you,\u201d she murmured, then stepped back and said, \u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d burn that awful mansion to the ground with everything inside it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it were up to me, I would. But it\u2019s not my decision.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn frowned. \u201cI thought since you defeated him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilled him,\u201d Lucas corrected.</p><p>Her lips flattened, but she nodded. \u201cSince you killed him, that everything of his would become yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted it, yes, but I don\u2019t. I\u2019ll hold his people safely until a permanent lord emerges.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow does that work?\u201d</p><p>Lucas lifted a corner of his mouth in a smile. \u201cI\u2019d tell you, Agent Hunter, but then I\u2019d have to kill you.\u201d He moved swiftly, snaking an arm around her waist and tugging her against him. \u201cAnd I definitely don\u2019t want to kill you, Katie mine. I have much better things to do with that luscious body of yours.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn flushed with obvious pleasure and tried to push him away. \u201cKeep your vampire secrets. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed, giving her firm ass a final caress before letting her go. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to South Dakota tonight. And I think that\u2019s where you need to look for your brother.\u201d</p><p>She sobered immediately, and he almost regretted reminding her. Almost. Because he knew that more than anything, her brother\u2019s absence haunted her. If Lucas could solve that one problem for her, he\u2019d be happy, but he\u2019d long ago given up believing in happy endings.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she agreed. \u201cThis . . .\u201d She gestured to indicate the Twin Cities, their lights glittering just beyond the big windows. \u201cThis was a bad decision on my part. I need to go back to the beginning, to first principles. I\u2019ll start over, reinterview everybody, check every place again. I missed something. I just have to figure out what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Lucas assured her. \u201cMy people will help you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to find him, Lucas. One way or the other. If I don\u2019t . . . \u201d She looked away, mouth tight, fists clenched as she struggled not to shed the tears shining in her blue eyes. \u201cI have to find him,\u201d she whispered, almost to herself.</p><p>Lucas put his arms around her and held her gently, like a piece of crystal that would shatter if you held it too tightly. He only hoped Kathryn was tougher than that, because Kurt had searched high and low, in places Kathryn would never have ventured, and he\u2019d found no trace. Daniel Hunter had disappeared into the wind, and Lucas was beginning to think he\u2019d stay that way.</p><p>The Badlands, South Dakota</p><p>Kurt quickened his pace as he neared the BenReifelVisitorCenter. He\u2019d parked his truck in the side lot there earlier, before setting off into the backcountry. He was calling it quits earlier than usual tonight. Lucas and most of the warriors had been out of town. They\u2019d fought and defeated Klemens in his Chicago lair last night and would be coming home later tonight. The club wasn\u2019t open, but there\u2019d be a party of sorts at the house, and Kurt would be there to help keep things in order. Once upon a time he\u2019d have been right there with them in Chicago, but he was a bartender now, a business manager. He might get bored with that eventually, might miss the blood rush of a well-fought battle, but for now he was content with mashing a few vampire heads now and then.</p><p>Tonight, he wasn\u2019t mashing anyone\u2019s head. He was looking for Dan. Kathryn Hunter had left town, following Alex Carmichael to Minneapolis. Kurt didn\u2019t believe Alex had anything to do with Dan\u2019s disappearance. The older vamp just didn\u2019t have it in him to do something like that, and why would he have to? He and Dan were business associates, friends even.</p><p>No, Kurt was convinced his friend Dan was still here someplace. He didn\u2019t know why he believed it so strongly. It was just a feeling. Maybe it was the blood they\u2019d shared that once out in the backcountry. It wasn\u2019t enough for a real connection. Dan had been more curious than committed to the exchange. But some gut instinct of Kurt\u2019s kept insisting that Dan was near, and Kurt had scoured the town looking for him without success. So, he\u2019d returned to the Badlands, thinking maybe he\u2019d missed something. He was a better than fair tracker and had haunted the wilds of the Badlands every night looking for Dan. Sometimes it was only an hour or two after the bar shut down for the night, other times, when the bar was closed, he\u2019d started at sunset and searched all night.</p><p>He paused, pulling back into the shadows as a truck turned off the highway and rolled through the parking lot to the small building used as a sort of office and storage by the rangers. He watched as a familiar figure leaned over to collect a Styrofoam container from the passenger seat, then climbed out of his truck and headed inside, using a key to open the locked door.</p><p>Kurt caught the scent of cooked food, and his gaze zeroed in on the Styrofoam container. Kind of late for dinner. Plus . . . he sniffed again. Meat, grilled and going cold, but rare enough that Kurt could still smell the fresh blood. And the man carrying it was a full-fledged vegetarian. Kind of a pain in the ass about it, actually.</p><p>Thankful that his truck was out of sight in the unlit parking lot near the visitor center, Kurt gathered the shadows to himself, confident that the desert night would hide him until he wanted to be seen. Once the unexpected visitor had entered the smaller building and closed the door, Kurt glided soundlessly across the parking lot. A sliver of light flashed around the side, and he slipped down that way until he was standing right outside a tiny window. He growled his frustration. The damn window was covered in some type of heavy, black cloth, so he couldn\u2019t see anything. He could hear the meat-toting vegetarian talking to someone, though. And he could smell that steak. Someone responded to the first man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kurt froze in recognition. Then he had to fight every instinct as he backed away and dialed a number.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s cell phone rang as he followed Kathryn into the SUV outside the Rapid City airport. She\u2019d been quiet on the flight home. It worried him on several fronts, not the least of which was that if they failed to find her brother, Kathryn would never recover. But the other thing was the clear sense that she was pulling away from him, or getting ready to pull away, which was the same thing. It was as if she\u2019d decided the end was coming, and she wanted to ease into the separation gently so it wouldn\u2019t tear as badly at her heart. Not to mention what it would do to his.</p><p>He checked the caller ID on his cell and frowned. Why would Kurt be calling him?</p> <p>\u201cKurt?\u201d he said, answering the call.</p><p>\u201cSire. I\u2019ve found Daniel Hunter.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced at Kathryn, but she was staring out the window, and, being human, couldn\u2019t hear what Kurt was saying.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, my lord. In the Badlands, near the visitor center.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas\u2019s thoughts raced as he tried to figure out a way to ask if Daniel was alive or dead without giving away anything to Kathryn, who had now turned her attention from the window and was half-listening to his conversation.</p><p>\u201cIn what condition?\u201d he asked finally.</p><p>\u201cAlive, my lord. I couldn\u2019t see him, but I heard him speak, and his captor brought him food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is that?\u201d Lucas growled.</p><p>\u201cCody Pilarski, my lord. The park ranger. It makes no sense, but that\u2019s what I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m there, my lord. My first thought was to go in alone, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas said instantly. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there within the hour. Don\u2019t let him leave, but wait for me if you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sire.\u201d</p><p>Lucas disconnected and dropped a casual arm over Kathryn\u2019s shoulder, pulling her closer. \u201cMason,\u201d he said to the vampire behind the wheel of the SUV. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the visitor center in the BadlandsNational Park. Do you know where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Mason responded in a slightly puzzled voice.</p><p>\u201cNick, I want four of our fighters with us. The rest can go to the ranch house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord, might I ask\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kathryn was staring at him now. Lucas turned his head to meet her gaze and said, \u201cKurt\u2019s found Daniel. We\u2019re going to go get him.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas had argued for her to stay in the truck. Like that was going to happen. Kathryn pulled her duffle out of the back of Lucas\u2019s SUV and retrieved her Glock 23, checking the magazine and working the slide to verify it was hot with one in the pipe. She clipped it to her service belt, along with her mini-Maglite, then grabbed a scrunchy and tied her hair back, twisting it into a low knot to keep it out of her way. The last thing she grabbed was her FBI ID. Whoever was in there was going into custody. There\u2019d be no bodies in the desert this time. This might be Lucas\u2019s territory, and she was more than grateful that Kurt had located Daniel when she had failed, but this was not vampire justice time. She was fairly certain a case like this would be bumped to at least the county level, but Sheriff Sutcliffe would be the one making the formal arrest. She\u2019d call him herself once this guy Pilarski was in custody, and she\u2019d kick herself later for not following up and interviewing Pilarski herself. Right now, she was going to get her brother back.</p><p>Lucas gave her a disapproving look as she joined the big vampire confab, but she ignored him. They were parked just down the road from the visitor center. The desert was nearly pitch-black, with only a little bit of moonlight to see by. The vamps could probably see just fine, but she couldn\u2019t make out anything a few feet away. She didn\u2019t switch on her flashlight, though. All she needed was for Pilarski to glance out a window, see her light and panic.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a small room near the back,\u201d Kurt was saying, \u201calong the right side of the building. It\u2019s mostly scruff back in there, and the window\u2019s covered up with a blanket or something, but you can tell when the light goes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Pilarski still inside?\u201d Kathryn asked him.</p><p>Kurt nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching ever since I called you. His truck\u2019s the one without the logo. They\u2019re not allowed to drive park vehicles for personal use, and that building he\u2019s in is supposed to be storage. There\u2019re a couple meeting rooms inside, but they don\u2019t get much use this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the back room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the one I think, it\u2019s not much more than a storage closet.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn turned to Lucas. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d she asked. That was her brother in there, but these were Lucas\u2019s people.</p><p>Lucas gave her a dry look of acknowledgment and addressed his lieutenant. \u201cNick, you take the others and circle the building. I don\u2019t want him escaping out a window. Kurt, you\u2019ll knock on the door. He knows you, knows you hang around the park at night, so it won\u2019t trigger his suspicion right away. Get him to walk you farther into the building, and Kathryn and I will come in behind you. I want to know how many are in there before we make a move. If it\u2019s just Pilarski, you take him out, and we\u2019ll get Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake him out nonlethally,\u201d Kathryn clarified. \u201cI want him arrested and charged.\u201d</p><p>As one, the vampires all turned to look at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded. \u201cHe\u2019s human, and kidnapping isn\u2019t a hanging offense. He\u2019ll go to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do it again when he gets out,\u201d Lucas commented.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. We don\u2019t even know why he did it this time. Besides, that\u2019s up to the courts, and I\u2019m sworn to uphold the law, whether I agree with it or not.\u201d</p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes in disgust. \u201cAs you wish. Nick, go. Kurt, you\u2019re with me and Debbie-Do-Right here.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn punched his arm, but he just laughed. Bastard vampire probably hadn\u2019t even felt it.</p><p>It took only a few minutes for everyone to get into position. Kathryn marveled again at the vampires\u2019 speed and stealth. It was too bad they weren\u2019t willing to hire themselves out to law enforcement, because just offhand she could think of a half dozen situations where their talents would come in handy. Did vampire big shots like Lucas forbid vampire involvement in law enforcement? Or was it just a matter of mutual distrust? She made a note to herself to check with Lucas. Later. First, Daniel.</p><p>Kurt climbed the concrete steps and knocked on the screen door. The initial response was silence, but after Kurt knocked again, Lucas leaned in to whisper in her ear that someone was approaching the door.</p><p>The door barely cracked open at first, then went wider as Pilarski recognized his visitor.</p><p>\u201cKurt,\u201d he said in obvious surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, dude? It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d Kurt agreed pleasantly, \u201cbut I saw your truck and wanted to be sure everything was cool with you. You need a ride somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, man. I\u2019m just catching up on some stuff. You know the government, nothing but paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Kurt laughed. \u201cSomeone needs to welcome them to the computer age. Mind if I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Um. I\u2019m not supposed to really\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kurt didn\u2019t wait for an invitation. He pulled the door open and stepped inside, forcing Pilarski to move or be knocked back.</p><p>\u201cWell, okay, I guess for a minute, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Pilarski hedged. \u201cYou want some tea or . . . Oh, fuck. Sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo, Cody,\u201d Kurt said easily. \u201cIs that meat I smell? You been holding out on us all this time? Sneaking a burger late at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he protested as they walked deeper into the building, their voices falling away. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kathryn missed whatever it was Pilarski didn\u2019t do, because Lucas was on the move, leaping up onto the step in a single graceful bound and pulling her effortlessly behind him. He went through the door first, completely silent, no more than a shadow among shadows. Kathryn pulled her weapon and followed, keenly aware of the noise she was making in contrast. Her footsteps were like an elephant over gravel, and her careful breathing sounded like puffing bellows. She glanced around and saw that Lucas was already down the hall, gliding toward a lit doorway where Kurt and Pilarski seemed to have turned off. She heard the slide of a tea kettle on the stove and figured it must be a kitchen or break room.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know vampires drank tea,\u201d Pilarski was saying to Kurt.</p><p>Kurt was standing in the doorway, leaning to one side. As they approached, he pointed to a doorway farther down the unlit hallway. \u201cSure, we do,\u201d he said casually, and straightened to stand in the center of the doorway, effectively blocking Pilarski\u2019s view as Lucas and Kathryn slipped past.</p><p>The door Kurt directed them to was at the very end of the hall. Lucas was already testing the knob when Kathryn came up next to him, but it was locked with a keyed deadbolt, and there was no key in sight. Lucas glanced over her shoulder toward the kitchen, where the tea kettle was now beginning to whistle fitfully, then he shrugged and kicked the door open.</p><p>The smell hit her first. She nearly fell to her knees in grief before she recognized it for what it was. Not death, not a decaying body, but human waste, dirt and rotting food. That bastard!</p><p>\u201cDaniel!\u201d she called. It was too dark. She holstered the Glock and pulled her flashlight instead, shining it around the room until she found a bundle of clothes on a cot in the corner.</p><p>\u201cLucas, I can\u2019t see a damn thing,\u201d she called as she rushed forward, her light leading the way. A greasy, yellow fixture came on overhead just as she reached the cot, and she saw her brother pressed against the corner, his face pale beneath the filth, his blue eyes, so much like her own, staring back at her in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cKat?\u201d he half-whispered.</p><p>She reached out for him, but he pushed back against the wall, holding out a hand to stop her. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cI\u2019m disgusting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d she said through her tears. She flicked off her light and crouched in front of her brother. \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief flash of his trademark smile as he said, \u201cI\u2019m not. But I will be. Just get me the fuck out of here, Kat.\u201d</p><p>Lucas was standing in the wrecked doorway, muttering into his cell phone. Probably calling back Nick and the guys, since the enemy in this case consisted of a lone park ranger. An obviously unbalanced park ranger, but no one they couldn\u2019t handle. The vampire lord stepped back, and Kurt appeared in the doorway.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, his eyes meeting Dan\u2019s. \u201cYou need a shower, man.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed, his eyes filling with tears. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying.\u201d</p><p>Kurt crossed the room in three long strides and did what her brother hadn\u2019t permitted her to do. He wrapped his arms around Daniel, filth and all, and Dan clung to the big vampire, his shoulders shaking as he cried silent tears of relief. Kurt pulled the blanket away with one hand, saw the metal cuff around Dan\u2019s ankle and snapped the chain with an angry growl. Then he looked up and met Kathryn\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get him cleaned up, if that\u2019s okay with you.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded silently, and Kurt started to help her brother to stand, but at the last minute Dan scrabbled for something under the blankets and came up with a camera.</p> <p>Kathryn stared, recognizing it for one of those she\u2019d left with the sheriff. \u201cHow\u2014\u201d she started to ask, suspicion blooming. \u201cI stored your gear at the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d</p><p>Dan shook his head, as if reading her mind. \u201cThe nut brought it to me, bragged how clever he\u2019d been, stealing it from under the Sheriff\u2019s nose.\u201d He tightened his hold on the camera, lifting it to eye level. \u201cThis is gonna win me a Pulitzer, Kat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d she scolded.</p><p>Kurt urged him toward the hallway, but Dan stopped in front of her and took her hand. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn tightened her hand on his. \u201cIt was Kurt who found you,\u201d she said, giving the bartending vampire a grateful look. \u201cI was sure Alex Carmichael had you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex?\u201d Dan repeated in confusion.</p> <p>\u201cLater,\u201d Kurt said. \u201cShower first.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed a little, gave Kathryn\u2019s fingers a final squeeze and repeated, \u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201d Then, as if the exchange had taken what little energy he had left, he leaned heavily against Kurt, who all but carried him out of the filthy room.</p><p>When they were gone, she gave Lucas a hard look. \u201cPilarski,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cAll tied up with a pretty bow, just as you ordered, Agent Hunter,\u201d he replied mockingly.</p><p>\u201cI know you think I\u2019m foolish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he said, then grimaced and covered his nose and mouth with one hand. \u201cBut could we finish this somewhere else? Even a human nose must be offended by the smell in here.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn belatedly remembered the stench, and her stomach roiled. She\u2019d been so preoccupied with Dan . . . Fighting a sudden urge to vomit, she hurried from the filthy room, pushing Lucas ahead of her. \u201cMove, vampire, unless you want me to add to the aroma.\u201d</p><p>Lucas grabbed her and raced them both down the hall and outside into the parking lot, where Kathryn leaned over, hands on her knees as she sucked in deep breaths of the brisk night air.</p> <p>\u201cGod, that was awful,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine . . . Hell, I need a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere comes your sheriff,\u201d Lucas commented from where he stood several feet away, probably just in case she lost the battle against her stomach.</p><p>Kathryn looked up as Sheriff Sutcliffe pulled into the lot, followed by a second patrol unit, both with their light bars flashing.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t call him yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had Nick call before we went in,\u201d Lucas said mildly. He shrugged when she gave him a questioning look. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like waiting around for the local Garda to get here. It can take a while for someone to show up in these small towns, especially at night.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn straightened, then patted Lucas\u2019s arm in appreciation as she went to meet the sheriff.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Sutcliffe,\u201d she greeted him.</p><p>\u201cAgent Hunter,\u201d he responded. \u201cHow\u2019s your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExhausted and hungry, but nothing a few days rest won\u2019t take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call for a rescue unit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend took him in,\u201d she said, letting him assume she meant in to the hospital. \u201cWe thought it would be faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s been right here the whole time,\u201d Sutcliffe said, shaking his head. \u201cHow\u2019d you find him?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnonymous tip on my cell phone about ninety minutes ago. The voice was a man\u2019s, but muffled. He said my brother was being held here, and since we were already en route from the airport, we came directly to the park to check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou waited to call me,\u201d he said in obvious disapproval.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct, sir. I saw no reason to make a scene if it turned out to be a prank. After all, you and I both checked things out here at the visitor center, and nothing tweaked our radar.\u201d She phrased it deliberately, making herself just as responsible as the sheriff\u2014maybe more\u2014for overlooking anything that might have indicated her brother was being held right under their noses.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d His gaze traveled over the vampires ranged behind her. There were only three\u2014Lucas, Mason and Nicholas\u2014since Lucas had already sent the others away. He would have sent even those two, but he hadn\u2019t been willing to leave Kathryn alone with the prisoner, and Nicholas had refused to leave Lucas alone with the human authorities. Trust-Issues-R-Us, apparently.</p><p>\u201cMister Donlon and his associates were with me when I received the tip,\u201d she explained, feeling only a slight twinge at manipulating the truth.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where it came from? The tip, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already had it checked. The call came from a throwaway cell. Impossible to trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn things. Well\u2014\u201d He looked beyond her to Cody Pilarski, who was hanging miserably between two husky vampires. \u201cWhat have you got to say for yourself, Cody?\u201d</p><p>Pilarski lifted his head and addressed the sheriff. \u201cI want to deal,\u201d he said sullenly. \u201cThis was Belinda\u2019s idea, not mine. Hunter\u2019d be dead if I hadn\u2019t protected him.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Sutcliffe shrugged. \u201cNot my call,\u201d he said, then turned to Kathryn, who was still absorbing Pilarski\u2019s claim. Belinda had been the one who instigated the kidnapping? She was the park ranger Kathryn had interviewed on her first day in town. The one who\u2019d gotten all flustered when talking about Dan. Kathryn had assumed she was smitten, but maybe she\u2019d simply been guilty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold Pilarski overnight,\u201d the sheriff was saying, \u201chave the County pick him up in the morning. And don\u2019t you worry about him getting bail, no matter what deal he gets. We don\u2019t take to kidnappers in South Dakota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that. And now, the scene is yours, Sheriff. I know I should stay, but my brother needs me. So, if it\u2019s all right with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry,\u201d Sutcliffe assured her. \u201cI understand, and I know where you work,\u201d he added, with a wink.</p><p>Kathryn laughed, relieved. She\u2019d known she was pushing it by not hanging around. It was bad enough that her brother, the most important witness, was already gone. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said sincerely. \u201cYou have my numbers, and I\u2019ll make sure we\u2019re available to give our statements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be in town?\u201d Sutcliffe verified, proving he wasn\u2019t totally gullible.</p><p>Kathryn nodded. \u201cA while,\u201d she said vaguely, very aware of Lucas\u2019s keen hearing picking up every word she said. \u201cYou can reach me on my cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough, then. I\u2019m glad everything worked out for you and your brother, Agent Hunter. This is a good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>Lucas came up behind her, not touching, but close enough that she could feel the heat of his presence. They stood silently until the sheriff ambled over to confer with his deputies, and then Lucas dipped his head to her ear and said, \u201cA while, Kathryn?\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the low rumble of his voice and the slight menace in the question. She\u2019d known this was coming. She had to go back to Virginia, her job was there. And her home, such as it was. In a perfect world, she might have stayed in this little town, bought a quaint little cottage and settled down to raise goats, or maybe paint masterpieces. It always happened that way in stories. Unfortunately, this was the real world.</p><p>\u201cKathryn?\u201d Lucas demanded.</p><p>She turned to face him, her hand automatically lifting to caress his beard-roughened jaw, her eyes meeting his golden gaze. And her heart twisted. She didn\u2019t know how it could have happened. Didn\u2019t know why it had happened now, and with a vampire of all people. But she loved him. It was going to tear her apart when she had to leave.</p><p>\u201cA while,\u201d she repeated, stroking her thumb over his soft lips.</p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t fooled. He eyed her suspiciously and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded. Saying good-bye was going to be hard enough, she thought sadly, but Lucas was used to getting his own way. He was going to make it even harder.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Kurt took Dan?\u201d she asked, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cKurt lives at the ranch.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn gave him a surprised look.</p><p>\u201cMost of my people do,\u201d he explained. \u201cVampires tend to live in nests. It\u2019s safer that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see my brother, then?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a narrow look. \u201cAren\u2019t you coming back to the ranch tonight?\u201d</p><p>Lucas was far too intuitive for Kathryn\u2019s comfort. \u201cOf course,\u201d she assured him, even though she would rather have gone to the motel. Kathryn didn\u2019t believe in dragging out the inevitable. Better to make a clean break of it. But Dan was at the ranch, and in her heart, she wanted these last few hours with Lucas. Tomorrow would be soon enough for heartbreak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kathryn\u2019s brother was waiting when Lucas finally got home to his ranch. Kurt had him sitting at the kitchen table, a cup of hot tea and the remains of a sandwich in front of him. Lucas eyed the food, then lifted his gaze to Kurt, one eyebrow cocked curiously.</p><p>\u201cJudy made the sandwich,\u201d Kurt explained. \u201cAnd we had the tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Lucas murmured. He heard Kathryn come in behind him. Dan had been watching the exchange between Lucas and Kurt, more curious than frightened. Not that he had anything to fear from Lucas\u2014Kathryn would stake him in his sleep if he touched one hair on her precious brother\u2019s head. But it was surprising, given his recent captivity, that Dan Hunter retained as much of himself as he did. It spoke to strength of character, and courage, too. Kathryn had raised him well, Lucas thought dryly.</p> <p>\u201cCan I hug you now?\u201d Kathryn demanded, bypassing Lucas to go directly to her brother\u2019s side.</p><p>He grinned, and Lucas abruptly saw the resemblance between them. The brother\u2019s hair was darker, his features obviously heavier, more masculine, but the eyes were the same deep blue, and that grin was what Kathryn\u2019s would have been if her life hadn\u2019t wrapped her up so tightly in responsibilities. Most especially a baby brother.</p><p>Dan Hunter stood, and brother and sister hugged. He was a good three inches taller than Kathryn, and yet when they hugged it was the hug of a mother and child. Lucas watched and felt an answering tug in his soul, the yearning of a child who\u2019d never had that kind of security. Or who\u2019d lost it so young that it was only a faint memory.</p><p>Kathryn ran her fingers through her brother\u2019s hair. \u201cDid you call Penny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you going back to California right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said carelessly. \u201cI never finished what I wanted to do here, and there\u2019s the new collection to work on. You said my gear\u2019s at the sheriff\u2019s? All of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, not concealing her surprise at his answer. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to go home? Or you can come to my place, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m gonna hang out here with Kurt awhile.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s sharp gaze flashed to Kurt, who gave her a conspiratorial wink.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d she said, then turned her attention back to Daniel. \u201cSit, baby,\u201d she said, urging him back into his seat.</p> <p>Lucas almost growled. She never called him \u201cbaby,\u201d he thought, then nearly laughed out loud. What? He was jealous of her damn brother? Maybe he should let her leave if this was what she turned him into.</p><p>\u201cKathryn,\u201d Lucas said softly, trying not to sound as irritated as he felt.</p><p>She turned to him, eyes wide in dismay. Or maybe guilt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cDan, this is Lucas Donlon. He\u2019s been helping me look for you. Lucas, my brother, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>Dan stood again and took a step closer to Lucas to offer his hand. But his expression, when he met Lucas\u2019s gaze, was no longer that of a beloved baby anything. It was full of warning and protectiveness, a look that said, hurt my sister and die.</p><p>\u201cKurt\u2019s told me all about you, Lord Donlon.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gripped the boy\u2019s hand, just managing to curb the instinct to crush his too fragile human bones. If not for Kathryn watching every nuance, he might have.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lucky man,\u201d Lucas said instead, \u201cto have someone like your sister care so deeply about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Dan agreed. \u201cAnd she deserves the best.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas nearly laughed at the obvious but unspoken threat. He bared his teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t push it, boy,\u201d he growled</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Kathryn hissed. \u201cBoth of you. Dan. Sit down and drink your tea, and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d She turned her glare on Lucas. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lucas replied smoothly. \u201cLet\u2019s take this to my office.\u201d He pushed open the kitchen\u2019s swinging door and gestured for her to precede him, giving the brother a dark look over his shoulder as he followed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Kathryn demanded once they were safely behind the closed door of his office.</p><p>\u201cAsk your baby brother,\u201d Lucas responded loftily. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who tried to break my fingers with his feeble human handshake.\u201d He circled his desk and slumped down into his comfortable chair, picking up a sword-shaped letter opener to play with.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this. You\u2019re jealous of my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason\u2014\u201d she started furiously.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Kathryn,\u201d he interrupted, raising his eyes to meet hers. \u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d</p><p>She froze mid-sentence. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour plans. You\u2019ve found your brother, and he\u2019s apparently staying here. Should be interesting, by the way. But what about you?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stared at him as she sank wordlessly into one of the chairs in front of his desk. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here, Lucas,\u201d she admitted softly. \u201cMy job\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour job. That\u2019s it, then? You and I mean nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe live thousands of miles apart,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t exactly work nine to five. This is the most I\u2019ve taken off work in . . . ever. Even if we traded off visiting each other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I can\u2019t do,\u201d Lucas said, throwing the letter opener onto his desk. \u201cVirginia belongs to another lord. I can\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you expect me to give up my life,\u201d she said, making it a statement, not a question.</p><p>\u201cYour job is your life? I doubt that. So what\u2019s the real problem here, Kathryn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. My problem is that relationships have a way of taking over. It starts out being fun, and pretty soon you\u2019re giving up time with friends, skipping out on work, and then before you know it, your life isn\u2019t your own anymore. It\u2019s someone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews flash, love. That\u2019s a two-way street. You\u2019re not the only one being asked to give up something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to give up anything! I don\u2019t want either one of us to give up anything. I just want my life to be mine. I spent twenty years taking care of my brother, and my father, too. I lived for their needs, their wants, their everything, and I promised myself that when Dan was grown I\u2019d never do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept here you are,\u201d he responded bitterly. \u201cRushing in once more to save your brother. Obviously, you\u2019re not as free as you thought,\u201d he added, surprisingly hurt by her words, by the idea that she considered what they had to be a burden, rather than a gift.</p><p>\u201cBut I love my brother. I can\u2019t just turn off my feelings, you know.\u201d</p><p>Lucas stared at her, concentrating on sitting perfectly still, on not showing any of the pain her words were causing him. Not that it seemed to matter. She was completely unaware of what she\u2019d said.</p><p>Lucas stood from behind his desk, the big leather chair gliding away noiselessly. \u201cAt least not the feelings you have for your brother,\u201d he commented flatly. \u201cBe safe, Kathryn. Nick will provide any assistance you require in arranging transportation.\u201d He strode across the room, heading for his private entrance.</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Kathryn pleaded as he pulled the door open. \u201cDon\u2019t leave like this.\u201d</p><p>But Lucas didn\u2019t turn around, didn\u2019t even look. There was nothing more to say.</p><p>Nick was coming down the hall as Lucas closed the door behind him, Kathryn\u2019s words still playing in his head.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Nick said, hurrying forward. \u201cI was just coming to your office.\u201d He paused, catching the expression on Lucas\u2019s face, and probably a whiff of his emotions, as well. \u201cMy lord? Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Agent Hunter will be leaving. Give her whatever help she needs. Where\u2019s Mason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown at the stables, I believe, with a few of the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet him up here. I\u2019m going to the homestead. The sooner the better, Nick.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn stood in Lucas\u2019s office, staring at the door he\u2019d shut in her face. She could open it. She could chase him down and force him to talk to her, to let her explain. But what was the point? Everything she\u2019d told him was true. They did live thousands of miles apart, and she\u2019d known when she said it that he couldn\u2019t visit her in Virginia. Which meant, regardless of Lucas\u2019s fine words about compromise, she\u2019d be the one expected to turn her life on its side once more. Lucas would still be here, on his ranch, with all of his people around him. Still the big, fucking lord of the realm. While she\u2019d be giving up the only thing that had ever been truly hers. Her job.</p><p>So, instead, you\u2019re giving up Lucas?</p><p>She swatted away the voice in her head. Who said she\u2019d ever had Lucas to give up in the first place? They\u2019d known each other for a few days, a week. Big deal. They hadn\u2019t even gotten past the lust phase of a relationship, much less anything else. Okay, so she\u2019d never actually been in lust like this before, but her friends had, and they\u2019d told her all about it. In great, fucking detail. With an emphasis on the fucking. So, maybe that\u2019s all this was with Lucas\u2014a few days of great sex.</p><p>But even if it wasn\u2019t, even if they\u2019d managed to stick it out a month, or a year, it would mean compromising on her job. Being with the FBI was the only thing she\u2019d ever wanted to do. And if she wasn\u2019t willing to give that up in order to be with Lucas, then maybe it wasn\u2019t love, after all.</p><p>The pictures on the wall next to Lucas\u2019s desk caught her eye, the ones she\u2019d admired at the very beginning, the ones Dan had taken in Ireland. She smiled sadly, thinking about a young Lucas crossing those fields with his mother, only to be turned away by the very people who should have protected them. She went over and touched the image of a running horse, sighing softly. Maybe Lucas was right. There was no sense in raising hope where there was none. Maybe a clean break was best. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So why didn\u2019t it feel that way?</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>One month later</p> <p>Lucas threw the phone down, ignoring the cracking sound as it hit his desk. What was that, the eighth one he\u2019d destroyed this month? Who cared? Maybe someone needed to find him a fucking cell phone that didn\u2019t shatter at every little bounce.</p><p>\u201cNicholas!\u201d he roared.</p><p>The hallway door popped open, and Nick stuck his head in. \u201cSire?\u201d</p><p>Lucas glowered at his lieutenant. Why the fuck was he standing out there in the first place? He\u2019d been doing more and more of that lately, lurking in the hall instead of staying in here where he belonged.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on in Topeka? Emmett just called to complain about zoning on the new compound.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmmett keeps trying to save money by shorting bribes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why the hell is he calling me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle it, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone better,\u201d Lucas grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. Is there anything else?\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave him a scowling glance. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Nick ducked back into the hallway and closed the door almost before Lucas finished that single syllable. What the fuck was that? He slumped down in his chair and stared moodily at the empty room. Where was everybody? His eye fell on the pictures of Ireland, the ones he used to love before . . .</p><p>He stood suddenly, grabbed the already broken cell phone from his desk, and hurled it across the room where it hit the wall with a pleasing smack, leaving a phone-sized divot in the plaster. That wasn\u2019t the first one either.</p><p>Lucas stared at the pockmarked wall. What the hell was he doing?</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d he bellowed once more.</p><p>Same thing. The door popped opened, and Nick\u2019s head appeared. \u201cSire?\u201d</p><p>Lucas studied him through narrowed eyes, then sighed. \u201cGet the jet ready. We\u2019re going to Virginia.\u201d</p><p>Nick blew out a dramatic breath. \u201cAbout fucking time, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Lucas would have thrown something at him, but there was nothing left to throw. And Nick was already gone. Smart vampire.</p> <p>Sitting once again behind his desk, Lucas swiveled his chair to the credenza and reached for the bat phone, since he\u2019d just destroyed his current cell. Punching the desired button, he listened to the call ring twice on the other side of the country before it was answered.</p><p>\u201cLucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI have a favor to ask.\u201d</p><p>Quantico, Virginia</p><p>Kathryn scanned the empty apartment, looking for anything she might have missed. She\u2019d already gone through every drawer and closet at least three times. Had already swept and vacuumed until the place was far cleaner than when she first moved in. Her landlord wouldn\u2019t even have to dust before renting it out again. Not that he\u2019d return her cleaning fee anyway, but it went against her nature to leave it dirty.</p><p>She picked up the small box of belongings that was the only thing left. It contained her answering machine and a small lamp, plus the few pieces of mail that had somehow slipped past the change of address she\u2019d filed at the post office. It was mostly junk mail, but it had her name and address on it, and she knew too much about identity fraud to leave it behind. Apparently, her OCD tendencies were in full bloom. It was the stress. She hoped getting out of here tonight would help with that.</p><p>Holding the box on one hip, she opened the front door, did a final visual check of the place she\u2019d called home for almost three years, then closed and locked the door. She\u2019d mail the keys back to her landlord on her way by the post office tonight. She had a small Priority Mail box all ready to go\u2014addressed, stamped, bubble packed so the keys wouldn\u2019t rattle . . . yep, her compulsions were definitely running the show.</p><p>Her apartment was on the third floor, so she took the stairs. The only time she\u2019d ever used the elevator was the day she\u2019d first moved in and yesterday to move out. The stairs were good exercise, and besides, anything that tired her out was a good thing lately. She wasn\u2019t sleeping well, either.</p><p>The fresh air felt good on her face when she opened the outside security door. She waited until she heard the door click shut behind her, then leaned over and checked to be sure her landlord had removed her name from the list of residents. He had. She snugged the box closer and straightened up when a car door slammed on the street behind her. She turned, registered the fact that the engine was still running, and her hand went automatically to the Glock 23 still clipped to her belt. It was late, and she\u2019d come directly from the office, making a final stop before . . .</p><p>\u201cKathryn.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s breath caught in her chest, and she hugged the box so closely against her hip that it hurt.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t recognize me?\u201d he teased, reaching out to take the box from her.</p><p>She relinquished it to him, even though it weighed nothing. She was too stunned at finding him on her doorstep to do anything else.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked. \u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t . . . I mean . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucas lifted one shoulder dismissively. \u201cDuncan\u2019s a friend. He made an exception . . . for one night,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cBut why\u2014\u201d Kathryn heard herself stumbling over her words, but couldn\u2019t seem to stop.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he said, his beautiful golden eyes meeting her gaze evenly. \u201cYou said we could visit, so I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m moving,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI\u2019m leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Lucas frowned. \u201cMoving where?\u201d He took an aggressive step forward. \u201cAnd with whom?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Kathryn nearly laughed at his outraged assumption that she had taken up with someone new. She\u2019d barely slept in a month because she missed him so much, and he thought she was moving in with her new lover.</p><p>She didn\u2019t laugh, though. She couldn\u2019t. Not when he was standing in front of her at last, looking so delicious she wanted to weep.</p><p>\u201cTurns out I was wrong,\u201d she whispered, her eyes greedily drinking in the sight of him standing on her front walk. \u201cI do want my life turned on its side.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave her a puzzled look.</p><p>His face blurred as tears filled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m moving to Minneapolis,\u201d she explained. \u201cI requested a transfer. Seems there aren\u2019t too many agents vying for that posting. Something about the weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinneapolis?\u201d Lucas repeated. He stared at her blankly, and then that glorious smile lit up his face. And her heart.</p><p>He set the box down to one side and pulled her into his arms. \u201cI missed you, a cuisle. I should never have let you leave.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn choked out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you could have stopped me,\u201d she said against the warm skin of his neck, \u201cbut I\u2019m sorry I left the way I did. And I\u2019m sorry for hurting you,\u201d she added, the words nearly swallowed by her sob of relief. She wrapped her arms around his back and held on tight, able to breathe freely for the first time since she\u2019d walked out of his office nearly a month ago.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d Lucas rumbled. \u201cJust tell me you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I love you so much it scares me to death. But living without you . . . it\u2019s like a hole in my heart I can never fill.\u201d</p><p>Lucas tightened his arms around her. \u201cAh, Katie mine, we\u2019ll be all right, then. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Now that you\u2019re here, I know.\u201d</p><p>Lucas dipped his head and kissed her. It was hot and tender at the same time and so very familiar. It was like coming home.</p><p>\u201cCan I give you a ride somewhere?\u201d he murmured, his mouth trailing warm kisses all along her jawline before coming back to her mouth.</p><p>Kathryn smiled against his lips. \u201cHow about Minneapolis? I was supposed to catch a flight tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed, then looped an arm around her waist and gestured at the waiting SUV. \u201cYour carriage awaits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my rental over there,\u201d she said, indicating a mid-sized sedan at the curb. \u201cMy truck went with the moving van yesterday, and I have to get this one back to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Nick will handle it. He\u2019ll be so grateful you\u2019re coming back with us, he\u2019ll do anything you ask.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, confused. \u201cWhy would Nick be\u2014\u201d</p><p>He actually looked guilty. \u201cIt\u2019s possible I\u2019ve been a bit . . . short-tempered lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019ll have to sweeten you up then. For Nick\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s laugh was low and seductive. \u201cI\u2019m counting on it, a cuisle. I am definitely counting on it.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Minneapolis, Minnesota</p><p>They watched from across the river as Lucas Donlon escorted the woman into a brightly lit gala, two more beautiful people in a hotel that was already full of them. The event of the year, the papers had called it. The rich and powerful of the state all gathered into one big, fat target. Fortunately for all of them, he wasn\u2019t hunting tonight. Tonight was just reconnaissance.</p><p>He watched as Lucas leaned over to whisper something private to the woman. She laughed at whatever it was, gazing up at him, her face shining with emotion. It was obvious to anyone with eyes to see that she was in love, and it seemed he returned the feeling. Lucas Donlon in love. Six months ago, Aden would have sworn Lucas would be the last one to fall.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the woman?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHis FBI bitch,\u201d Magda supplied, all but spitting the words. There was hatred there. And not just for the woman, but Donlon, too. A woman scorned, perhaps? The very worst kind in his experience.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about her,\u201d Magda continued. \u201cWorry about Donlon and his plans for the Midwest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he\u2019d opened it up to all comers. The first round\u2019s in two weeks,\u201d one of the other vampires objected. There were two of them, and Aden hadn\u2019t figured out yet if they were serious contenders, or simply Magda\u2019s pets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he says,\u201d she responded darkly. \u201cBut competitions can be fixed. He and Raphael are thick as thieves, and they have big plans that they\u2019re not sharing with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Or perhaps they\u2019re simply not sharing them with you, Aden thought to himself, dismissing the female vampire\u2019s fears of a grand conspiracy.</p><p>\u201cRaphael\u2019s involved in this?\u201d the other vamp who\u2019d posed the earlier question protested. \u201cNo one said anything about taking on Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d Magda mocked. \u201cFuck Raphael. He can be killed like any other vampire. Klemens almost got him a few months back. If the fool had hired a competent assassin, Lord Fucking Raphael would already be dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI heard there\u2019d been an attempt, but not who did it,\u201d Aden commented. \u201cIt was Klemens?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHired a human sniper who missed. Should have hired a vampire instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, Klemens is dead, while Raphael lives on,\u201d Aden said dryly, tired of her hissing commentary. \u201cI doubt that\u2019s a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so Klemens is dead. Doesn\u2019t matter why.\u201d She gave Aden a dirty look. He\u2019d interrupted her moment in the limelight, and she was a woman who liked the light. \u201cWe\u2019re here because Klemens is gone, and Lucas is vulnerable,\u201d she continued. \u201cLook at him. I could take him out from here if I had a decent rifle.\u201d</p><p>Aden doubted that, but he kept the thought to himself.</p> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d one of Magda\u2019s pets asked.</p><p>\u201cWe take out Donlon and split the Midwest territory,\u201d Magda asserted boldly. \u201cJust remember, Donlon\u2019s Plains territory is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can hold it,\u201d Aden commented softly. He pushed away from the wall and stood to his full height. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you lads, but I\u2019ve no intention of taking on Donlon. I want the Midwest, and I\u2019ve no need to skulk in the shadows with angry women in order to do it.\u201d</p><p>Magda spun around to face him, bristling, fangs bared. Aden gave her a dismissive glance. She was full of bitterness, this one, and set on revenge. But she had no power to back it up, and he had no desire to get caught up in her schemes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see how tough you are when the shit hits the fan,\u201d she sneered.</p><p>Aden brushed dirt from his sleeve. \u201cYes, we will,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cSee you in Chicago, lads. Should be interesting.\u201d</p> <p>To be continued . . . </p> </body></html>"]
