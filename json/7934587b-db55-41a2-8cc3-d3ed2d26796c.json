DON\u2019T PANIC. Everything\u2019s going to be fine. Of course it is.</p><p>Of course it is.</p><p>\u201cIf you could lift up your top, Mrs. Brandon?\u201d The sonographer has a pleasant, professional air as she looks down at me. \u201cI need to apply some jelly to your abdomen before we start the scan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say without moving a muscle. \u201cThe thing is, I\u2019m just a teeny bit...nervous.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m lying on a bed at the Chelsea and Westminster hospital, tense with anticipation. Any minute now, Luke and I will see our baby on the screen for the first time since it was just a teeny blob. I still can\u2019t quite believe it. In fact, I still haven\u2019t quite got over the fact that I\u2019m pregnant. In nineteen weeks\u2019 time I, Becky Brandon, n\u00e9e Bloomwood...am going to be a mother. A mother!</p><p>Luke\u2019s my husband, by the way. We\u2019ve been married for just over a year and this is a one hundred percent genuine honeymoon baby! We traveled loads on our honeymoon, but I\u2019ve pretty much worked out that we conceived it when we were staying in this gorgeous resort in Sri Lanka, called Unawatuna, all orchids and bamboo trees and beautiful views.</p><p>Unawatuna Brandon.</p><p>Miss Unawatuna Orchid Bamboo-tree Brandon.</p> <p>Hmm. I\u2019m not sure what Mum would say.</p><p>\u201cMy wife had a slight accident in the early stages of pregnancy,\u201d Luke explains from his seat beside the bed. \u201cSo she\u2019s a little anxious.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my hand supportively, and I squeeze back. In my pregnancy book, Nine Months of Your Life, it says you should include your partner in all aspects of your pregnancy, otherwise he can feel hurt and alienated. So I\u2019m including Luke as much as I possibly can. Like, last night I included him in watching my new DVD, Toned Arms in Pregnancy. He suddenly remembered in the middle that he had to make a business call, and missed quite a lot \u2014 but the point is, he doesn\u2019t feel shut out.</p><p>\u201cYou had an accident?\u201d The sonographer pauses in her tapping at the computer.</p><p>\u201cI fell off this mountain when I was looking for my long-lost sister in a storm,\u201d I explain. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was pregnant at the time. And I think maybe I bashed the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The sonographer looks at me kindly. She has graying brown hair tied back in a knot, with a pencil stuck into it. \u201cWell, babies are resilient little things. Let\u2019s just have a look, shall we?\u201d</p> <p>Here it is. The moment I\u2019ve been obsessing over for weeks. Gingerly I lift up my top and look down at my swelling stomach.</p><p>\u201cIf you could just push all your necklaces aside?\u201d she adds. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a collection you have there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re special pendants.\u201d I loop them together with a jangle. \u201cThis one is an Aztec maternity symbol, and this is a gestation crystal...and this is a chiming ball to soothe the baby...and this is a birthing stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA birthing stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou press it on a special spot on your palm, and it takes away the pain of labor,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt\u2019s been used since ancient Maori times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d The sonographer raises an eyebrow and squeezes some transparent gloop on my stomach. Frowning slightly, she applies the ultrasound probe thing to my skin, and instantly a fuzzy black-and-white image appears on the screen.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>That\u2019s our baby. Inside me. I dart a look at Luke, and he\u2019s gazing at the screen, transfixed.</p> <p>\u201cThere are the four chambers of the heart....\u201d The sonographer is moving the probe around. \u201cNow we\u2019re looking at the shoulders....\u201d She points to the screen and I squint obediently, even though, to be honest, I can\u2019t see any shoulders, only blurry curves.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an arm...one hand...\u201d Her voice trails off and she frowns.</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the little room. I feel a sudden grip of fear. That\u2019s why she\u2019s frowning. The baby\u2019s only got one hand. I knew it.</p><p>A wave of overpowering love and protectiveness rises up inside me. Tears are welling in my eyes. I don\u2019t care if our baby\u2019s only got one hand. I\u2019ll love it just as much. I\u2019ll love it more. Luke and I will take it anywhere in the world for the best treatment, and we\u2019ll fund research, and if anyone even dares give my baby a look\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd the other hand...\u201d The sonographer\u2019s voice interrupts my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cOther hand?\u201d I look up, choked. \u201cIt\u2019s got two hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...yes.\u201d The sonographer seems taken aback at my reaction. \u201cLook, you can see them here.\u201d She points at the image, and to my amazement I can just about make out the little bony fingers. Ten of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I gulp, wiping my eyes with a tissue she hands me. \u201cIt\u2019s just such a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything seems absolutely fine as far as I can tell,\u201d she says reassuringly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s normal to be emotional in pregnancy. All those hormones swilling about.\u201d</p><p>Honestly. People keep talking about hormones. Like Luke last night, when I cried over that TV ad with the puppy. I\u2019m not hormonal, I\u2019m perfectly normal. It was just a very sad ad.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d The sonographer taps at her keyboard again. A row of black-and-white scan pictures curls out of the printer, which she hands to me. I peer at the first one \u2014 and you can see the distinct outline of a head. It\u2019s got a little nose and a mouth and everything.</p> <p>\u201cSo. I\u2019ve done all the checks.\u201d She swivels round on her chair. \u201cAll I need to know now is whether you want to know the gender of the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Luke answers with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked it through at great length, haven\u2019t we, Becky? And we both feel it would spoil the magic to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d The sonographer smiles back. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019ve decided, I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>She \u201cwon\u2019t say anything\u201d? That means she\u2019s already seen what the sex is. She could just tell us right now!</p><p>\u201cWe hadn\u2019t actually decided, had we?\u201d I say. \u201cNot for definite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell...yes, we had, Becky.\u201d Luke seems taken aback. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember, we talked about it for a whole evening and agreed we wanted it to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right, yes.\u201d I can\u2019t take my eyes off the blurry print of the baby. \u201cBut we could have our surprise now! It would be just as magical!\u201d</p><p>OK, maybe that\u2019s not exactly true. But isn\u2019t he desperate to know?</p><p>\u201cIs that really what you want?\u201d As I look up I can see a streak of disappointment in Luke\u2019s face. \u201cTo find out now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I hesitate. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>The last thing I want is to upset Luke. He\u2019s been so sweet and loving to me since I\u2019ve been pregnant. Recently I\u2019ve had cravings for all sorts of odd combinations \u2014 like the other day I had this sudden weird desire for pineapple and a pink cardigan. And Luke drove me to the shops especially to get them.</p> <p>He\u2019s about to say something, when his mobile phone starts ringing. He whips it out of his pocket and the sonographer puts up a hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you can\u2019t use that in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Luke frowns as he sees the caller display. \u201cIt\u2019s Iain. I\u2019d better call him back.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t need to ask which Iain. It\u2019ll be Iain Wheeler, the chief marketing honcho of the Arcodas Group. Luke has his own PR company, Brandon Communications, and Arcodas is Luke\u2019s big new client. It was a real coup when he won them and it\u2019s given a fantastic boost to the company \u2014 he\u2019s already hired more staff and is planning to open loads of new European offices on the back of it.</p><p>So it\u2019s all wonderful for Brandon Communications. But as usual, Luke\u2019s working himself into the ground. I\u2019ve never seen him so at anyone\u2019s beck and call before. If Iain Wheeler calls, he always, always calls him back within five minutes, whether he\u2019s in another meeting, or he\u2019s having supper, or even if it\u2019s the middle of the night. He says it\u2019s the service industry and Arcodas is his mega-client, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re paying for.</p><p>All I can say is, if Iain Wheeler calls while I\u2019m in labor, then that phone is going straight out the window.</p><p>\u201cIs there a landline I can use nearby?\u201d Luke is asking the sonographer. \u201cBecky, you don\u2019t mind....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d I wave a hand.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d the sonographer says, getting up. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a moment, Mrs. Brandon.\u201d</p><p>The two of them disappear out the door, which closes with a heavy clunk.</p><p>I\u2019m alone. The computer is still on. The ultrasound probe thing is resting next to the monitor.</p><p>I could just reach over and\u2014</p><p>No. Don\u2019t be silly. I don\u2019t even know how to use an ultrasound. And besides, it would spoil the magical surprise. If Luke wants us to wait, then we\u2019ll wait.</p><p>I shift on the couch and examine my nails. I can wait for things. Of course I can. I can easily\u2014</p><p>Oh God. No I can\u2019t. Not till December. And it\u2019s all right there in front of me...and nobody\u2019s about....</p><p>I\u2019ll just have a teeny peek. Just really quickly. And I won\u2019t tell Luke. We\u2019ll still have the magical surprise at the birth \u2014 except it won\u2019t be quite so much of a surprise for me. Exactly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaning right over, I manage to grab the ultrasound stick. I apply it to the gel on my stomach \u2014 and at once the blurry image reappears on the screen.</p><p>I did it! Now I just have to shift it slightly to get the crucial bit.... Frowning with concentration, I move the probe around on my abdomen, tilting it this way and that, craning my neck to see the screen. This is a lot easier than I thought! Maybe I should become a sonographer. I\u2019m obviously a bit of a natural\u2014</p><p>There\u2019s the head. Wow, it\u2019s huge! And that bit must be\u2014</p><p>My hand freezes and I catch my breath. I\u2019ve just spotted it. I\u2019ve seen the sex of our baby!</p> <p>It\u2019s a boy!</p><p>The image isn\u2019t quite as good as the sonographer\u2019s \u2014 but even so, it\u2019s unmistakable. Luke and I are going to have a son!</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say aloud to the screen, my voice cracking slightly. \u201cHello, little boy!\u201d</p><p>And now I can\u2019t stop the tears rolling down my cheeks. We\u2019re having a gorgeous baby boy! I can dress him up in cute overalls, and buy him a pedal car, and Luke can play cricket with him, and we can call him\u2014</p><p>Oh my God. What are we going to call him?</p> <p>I wonder if Luke would go for Birkin. Then I could get a Birkin to be his nappy bag.</p><p>Birkin Brandon. That\u2019s quite cool.</p><p>\u201cHi, little baby,\u201d I croon gently to the big round head on the screen. \u201cDo you want to be called Birkin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The sonographer\u2019s voice makes me jump. She\u2019s standing at the door with Luke, looking appalled. \u201cThat\u2019s hospital equipment! You shouldn\u2019t be touching it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, wiping my eyes. \u201cBut I just had to have another quick look. Luke, I\u2019m talking to our baby. It\u2019s just...amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see!\u201d Luke\u2019s eyes light up, and he hurries across the room, followed by the sonographer. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t care if Luke sees it\u2019s a boy and the surprise is ruined. I have to share this precious moment with him.</p><p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s the head!\u201d I point. \u201cHello, darling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s its face?\u201d Luke sounds a bit perturbed.</p><p>\u201cDunno. Round the other side.\u201d I give a little wave. \u201cIt\u2019s Mummy and Daddy here! And we love you very\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brandon.\u201d The sonographer cuts me off. \u201cYou\u2019re talking to your bladder.\u201d</p><p>Well, how was I supposed to know it was my bladder? It looked just like a baby.</p><p>As we walk into the consultant obstetrician\u2019s room, I\u2019m still feeling rather hot about the cheeks. The sonographer gave me this huge great lecture about how I could have done damage to myself or broken the machine, and we only managed to get away after Luke promised a big donation to the scanner appeal.</p><p>And, she said, since I hadn\u2019t been anywhere near the baby, it was very unlikely I\u2019d seen the sex. Hmph.</p> <p>But as I sit down opposite Dr. Braine, our obstetrician, I feel myself start to cheer up. He\u2019s such a reassuring man, Dr. Braine. He\u2019s in his sixties, with graying, well-groomed hair and a pin-stripe suit and a faint aroma of old-fashioned aftershave. And he\u2019s delivered thousands of babies, including Luke! To be honest, I can\u2019t really imagine Luke\u2019s mother Elinor giving birth, but I guess it must have happened somehow. And as soon as we discovered I was pregnant, Luke said we had to find out if Dr. Braine was still practicing, because he was the best in the country.</p><p>\u201cDear boy.\u201d He shakes Luke\u2019s hand warmly. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well indeed.\u201d Luke sits down beside me. \u201cAnd how\u2019s David?\u201d</p><p>Luke went to school with Dr. Braine\u2019s son and always asks after him when we meet.</p><p>There\u2019s silence as Dr. Braine considers the question. This is the only thing I find a tad annoying about him. He mulls over everything you say as though it\u2019s of the greatest importance, whereas you were actually just making some random remark to keep the conversation going. At our last appointment I asked where he had bought his tie, and he thought about it for five minutes, then phoned his wife to check, and it was all a total saga. And I didn\u2019t even like the stupid tie.</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s very well,\u201d he says at last, nodding. \u201cHe sends his regards.\u201d There\u2019s another pause as he peruses the sheet from the sonographer. \u201cVery good,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cEverything\u2019s in order. How are you feeling, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine!\u201d I say. \u201cHappy that the baby\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still working full-time, I see.\u201d Dr. Braine glances at my form. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not too demanding for you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beside me, Luke gives a muffled snort.

Which is impossible, because all the newspapers have been talking about it for weeks. Yesterday the Daily World called it the \u201cbiggest retail disaster in British history.\u201d</p><p>The only plus about working for a failure of a shop is that it means I can take as much time off as I like for doctors\u2019 appointments and prenatal classes. And if I don\u2019t hurry back, no one even notices.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure things will turn around soon,\u201d he says encouragingly. \u201cNow, did you have any other questions?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cActually, I did have one question, Dr. Braine.\u201d I hesitate. \u201cNow that the scan results are OK, would you say it\u2019s safe to...you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Dr. Braine nods understandingly. \u201cA lot of couples abstain from intercourse in early pregnancy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean sex!\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cI meant shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping?\u201d Dr. Braine seems taken aback.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t bought anything for the baby yet,\u201d I explain. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to jinx it. But if everything looks OK, then I can start this afternoon!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help sounding excited. I\u2019ve been waiting and waiting to start shopping for the baby. And I\u2019ve just read about this fabulous new baby shop on the King\u2019s Road, called Bambino. I actually took a bona fide afternoon off, especially to go!</p><p>I feel Luke\u2019s gaze on me and turn to see him regarding me with incredulity.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, what do you mean, \u2018start\u2019?\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t bought anything for the baby yet!\u201d I say, defensive. \u201cYou know I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you haven\u2019t bought a miniature Ralph Lauren dressing gown?\u201d Luke counts off on his fingers. \u201cOr a rocking horse? Or a pink fairy outfit with wings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are for it to have when it\u2019s a toddler,\u201d I retort with dignity. \u201cI haven\u2019t bought anything for the baby.\u201d</p><p>Honestly. Luke\u2019s not going to be a very good dad if he doesn\u2019t know the difference.</p><p>Dr. Braine is following our conversation, looking perplexed.</p><p>\u201cI take it you don\u2019t wish to know the sex of the baby?\u201d he puts in.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d says Luke, sounding determined. \u201cWe want to keep it a surprise, don\u2019t we, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...yes.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cUnless maybe you think, Dr. Braine, that we should know for very good, unavoidable medical reasons?\u201d</p> <p>I look hard at Dr. Braine, but he doesn\u2019t get the message.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d He beams.</p><p>Drat.</p><p>It\u2019s another twenty minutes before we leave the room, about three of which are spent in Dr. Braine examining me, and the rest in he and Luke reminiscing about some school cricket match. I\u2019m trying to be polite and listen, but I can\u2019t help fidgeting with impatience. I want to get to Bambino!</p><p>At last the appointment\u2019s over and we\u2019re walking out onto the busy London street. A woman walks past with an old-fashioned Silver Cross pram, and I discreetly eye it up. I definitely want a pram like that, with gorgeous bouncy wheels. Except I\u2019ll have it customized hot pink. It\u2019ll be so fab. People will call me the Girl with the Hot Pink Pram. Except if it\u2019s a boy, I\u2019ll have it sprayed baby blue. No...aquamarine. And everyone will say\u2014</p><p>\u201cI spoke to Giles from the estate agents this morning.\u201d Luke breaks into my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I look up in excitement. \u201cDid he have anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I deflate.</p><p>At the moment, we live in this amazing penthouse flat which Luke has had for years. It\u2019s stunning, but it doesn\u2019t have a garden, and there\u2019s lots of immaculate beige carpet everywhere and it\u2019s not exactly a baby type of place. So a few weeks ago we put it on the market and started looking for a nice family house.</p><p>The trouble is, the flat was snapped up immediately. Which, I don\u2019t want to boast or anything, was totally due to my brilliant styling. I put candles everywhere, and a bottle of champagne on ice in the bathroom, and loads of \u201clifestyle\u201d touches like opera programs and invitations to glittering society events (which I borrowed from my posh friend Suze).

We haven\u2019t seen a single house we like and now the estate agent keeps saying the market\u2019s very \u201cdry\u201d and \u201cpoor\u201d and had we thought of renting?</p><p>I don\u2019t want to rent. I want to have a lovely new house to bring the baby home to.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t find a place?\u201d I look up at Luke. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re cast out on the streets? It\u2019s going to be winter! I\u2019ll be heavily pregnant!\u201d</p><p>I have a sudden image of myself trudging up Oxford Street while a choir sings \u201cO Little Town of Bethlehem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDarling, we won\u2019t be cast out on the streets! But Giles said we may need to be more flexible in our requirements.\u201d Luke pauses. \u201cI think he meant your requirements, Becky.\u201d</p><p>That is so unfair! When they sent over the Property Search Form, it said, \u201cPlease be as specific as possible in your wishes.\u201d So I was. And now they\u2019re complaining!</p><p>\u201cWe can forget the Shoe Room, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I stop at his expression. I once saw a Shoe Room on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and I\u2019ve been hankering after one ever since. \u201cOK, then,\u201d I say tamely.</p><p>\u201cAnd we might need to be more flexible on area\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind that!\u201d I say, as Luke\u2019s mobile starts ringing. \u201cIn fact, I think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Luke who\u2019s always been so keen on Maida Vale, not me. There are loads of places I\u2019d like to live.</p><p>\u201cLuke Brandon here,\u201d Luke\u2019s saying in his businesslike way. \u201cOh, hi there. Yes, we\u2019ve had the scan. Everything looks good. It\u2019s Jess,\u201d he adds to me. \u201cShe tried you but your phone\u2019s still switched off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess!\u201d I say, delighted. \u201cLet me talk to her!\u201d</p><p>Jess is my sister. My sister. It still gives me such a kick to say that. All my life, I thought I was an only child \u2014 and then I discovered I had a long-lost half sister! We didn\u2019t exactly get on to begin with, but ever since we got trapped in a storm together, and properly talked, we\u2019ve been real friends.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen her for a couple of months because she\u2019s been away in Guatemala on some geology research project. But we\u2019ve called and e-mailed each other, and she\u2019s texted me pictures of herself on top of some cliff. (Wearing a hideous blue anorak instead of the cool faux fur jacket I got her. Honestly.)</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to the office now,\u201d Luke is saying into the phone. \u201cAnd Becky\u2019s off shopping. Do you want a word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d I hiss in horror. He knows he\u2019s not supposed to mention the word shopping to Jess. Making a face at him, I take the phone and put it to my ear. \u201cHi, Jess! How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great!\u201d She sounds all distant and crackly. \u201cI was just calling to hear how the scan went.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help feeling touched at her remembering. She\u2019s probably hanging by a rope in some crevasse somewhere, chipping away at the rock face, but she still took the trouble to call.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Luke said. Thank goodness for that.\u201d I can hear the relief in Jess\u2019s voice. I know she feels guilty about me falling off the mountain, because I\u2019d gone up there looking for her, because\u2014</p><p>Anyway, it\u2019s a long story. The point is, the baby\u2019s OK.</p><p>\u201cSo, Luke says you\u2019re going shopping?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust some essentials for the baby,\u201d I say casually. \u201cSome...er...recycled nappies. From the thrift shop.\u201d I can see Luke laughing at me, and hastily turn away.</p><p>The thing about my sister Jess is, she doesn\u2019t like shopping or spending money or ruining the earth with evil consumerism. And she thinks I don\u2019t either. She thinks I\u2019ve followed her lead and embraced frugality.</p><p>I did embrace it for about a week. I ordered a big sack of oats, and I bought some clothes from Oxfam and I made lentil soup. But the trouble with being frugal is, it gets so boring. You get sick of soup, and not buying magazines because they\u2019re a waste of money, and sticking bits of soap together to make one big revolting lump. And the oats were getting in the way of Luke\u2019s golf clubs, so in the end I chucked them out and bought some Weetabix instead.</p><p>Only I can\u2019t tell Jess, because it\u2019ll ruin our lovely sisterly bond.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the article about making your own baby wipes?\u201d she\u2019s saying with enthusiasm. \u201cIt should be pretty easy. I\u2019ve started saving rags for you. We could do it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um...yes!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jess keeps sending me issues of a magazine called Frugal Baby.

I don\u2019t want to put the baby to bed in a \u00a33 plastic laundry basket. I want to buy a cute little cradle with white frills.</p><p>Now she\u2019s going on about something called \u201csustainable hemp babygros.\u201d I think I might end this conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go, Jess,\u201d I cut in. \u201cWill you make it to Mum\u2019s party?\u201d</p><p>My mum\u2019s having a sixtieth birthday party next week. Loads of people are invited, and there\u2019s going to be a band, and Martin from next door is going to do conjuring tricks!</p> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d says Jess. \u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it! See you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d</p><p>I switch off the phone and turn to see that Luke has managed to hail a taxi. \u201cShall I drop you off at the thrift shop?\u201d he inquires, opening the door.</p><p>Oh, ha-ha.</p><p>\u201cBambino on the King\u2019s Road, please,\u201d I say to the driver. \u201cHey, do you want to come, Luke?\u201d I add with sudden enthusiasm. \u201cWe could look at cool prams and everything and then have tea somewhere nice....\u201d</p> <p>I already know from Luke\u2019s expression that he\u2019s going to say no.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I need to get back. Meeting with Iain. I\u2019ll come another time, I promise.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no point being disappointed. I know Luke\u2019s working full-out on the Arcodas account. At least he made time for the scan. The taxi moves off and Luke puts his arm round me.</p><p>\u201cYou look glowing,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I beam back at him. I have to say, I do feel pretty good today. I\u2019m wearing my fab new maternity Earl Jeans, and high wedge espadrilles, and a sexy halter-neck top from Isabella Oliver, which I\u2019ve ruched up to show just a teeny hint of tanned bump.</p><p>I never realized it before \u2014 but being pregnant rocks! OK, your tummy gets big \u2014 but it\u2019s supposed to. And your legs look thinner in comparison. And you get this brilliant cleavage, all of a sudden. (Which I have to say, Luke is quite keen on.)</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s have another look at those scan pictures,\u201d he says. I delve into my handbag for the shiny roll of images and for a while we just gaze at them together: at the rounded head; at the profile of a little face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting off a whole new person,\u201d I murmur, my eyes riveted. \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Luke\u2019s arm tightens around me. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest adventure we\u2019ll ever go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how nature works.\u201d I bite my lip, feeling the emotions rise again. \u201cAll these maternal instincts have kicked in. I just feel like...I want to give our baby everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBambino,\u201d says the taxi driver, pulling over to the pavement. I look up from the scan pictures to see the most fantastic, brand-new shop fa\u00e7ade. The paintwork is cream, the canopy is red stripes, the doorman is dressed up as a toy soldier, and the windows are like a treasure trove for children. There are beautiful little baby clothes on mannequins, a child\u2019s bed shaped like a fifties Cadillac, a real little Ferris wheel going round and round....</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I breathe, reaching for the taxi\u2019s door handle. \u201cI wonder if that Ferris wheel is for sale! Bye, Luke, see you later....\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already halfway toward the entrance, when I hear Luke calling out, \u201cWait!\u201d I turn back to see a look of slight alarm on his face. \u201cBecky.\u201d He leans out of the taxi. \u201cThe baby doesn\u2019t have to have everything.\u201d</p><p>TWO</p> <p>HOW ON EARTH did I hold off baby shopping for so long?</p><p>I\u2019ve reached the New Baby department on the first floor. It\u2019s softly carpeted, with nursery rhymes playing over the sound system, and huge plushy animals decorating the entrance. An assistant dressed as Peter Rabbit has given me a white wicker basket, and as I look around, clutching it, I can feel the lust rising.</p><p>They say motherhood changes you \u2014 and they\u2019re right. For once in my life I\u2019m not thinking about myself. I\u2019m being totally selfless! All this is for my unborn child\u2019s welfare.</p><p>In one direction are banks of gorgeous cradles and rotating tinkly mobiles. In the other I can glimpse the alluring chrome glint of prams. Ahead of me are displays of teeny-weeny outfits. I take a step forward, toward the clothes. Just look at those adorable bunny slippers. And the tiny cowhide padded jackets...and there\u2019s a massive section of Baby Dior...and, oh my God, D&amp;G Junior...</p><p>OK. Calm down. Let\u2019s be organized. What I need is a list. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>From my bag I pull Nine Months of Your Life. I turn to chapter eight: \u201cShopping for Your Baby\u201d and eagerly start scanning the page.</p><p>Clothes:</p><p>Do not be tempted to buy too many tiny baby clothes. White is recommended for ease of washing. Three plain babygros and six tops will suffice.</p><p>I look at the words for a moment. The thing is, it\u2019s never a good idea to follow a book too closely. It even said in the introduction, \u201cYou will not want to take every piece of advice. Every baby is different and you must be guided by your instincts.\u201d</p> <p>My instincts are telling me to get a cowhide jacket.</p><p>I hurry over to the display and look through the size labels. \u201cNewborn baby.\u201d \u201cSmall baby.\u201d How do I know if I\u2019m going to have a small baby or not? Experimentally I prod my bump. It feels quite small so far, but who can tell? Maybe I should buy both, to be on the safe side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Baby in Urbe snowsuit!\u201d A manicured hand appears on the rack in front of me and grabs a white quilted suit on a chic black hanger. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to find one of these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d I say instinctively and grab the last remaining one.</p><p>\u201cYou know in Harrods the waiting list for these is six months?\u201d The owner of the hand is a hugely pregnant blond girl in jeans and a stretchy turquoise-wrap top. \u201cOh my God, they have the whole Baby in Urbe range.\u201d She starts piling baby clothes into her white wicker basket. \u201cAnd look! They\u2019ve got Piglet shoes. I must get some for my daughters.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve never even heard of Baby in Urbe. Or Piglet shoes.</p><p>How can I be so uncool? How can I not have heard of any of the labels? As I survey the tiny garments before me I feel a slight panic. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in or what\u2019s out. I have no idea about baby fashion. And I\u2019ve only got about four months to get up to speed.</p><p>I could always ask Suze. She\u2019s my oldest, best friend, and has three children, Ernest, Wilfrid, and Clementine. But it\u2019s a bit different with her. Most of her baby clothes are hand-embroidered smocks handed down through the generations and darned by her mother\u2019s old retainer, and the babies sleep in antique oak cots from the family stately home.</p><p>I grab a couple of pairs of Piglet shoes, several Baby in Urbe rompers, and a pair of Jelly Wellies, just to be on the safe side. Then I spot the sweetest little pink baby dress. It has rainbow buttons and matching knickers and little tiny socks. It\u2019s absolutely gorgeous. But what if we\u2019re having a boy?</p><p>This is impossible, not knowing the sex. There must be some way I can secretly find out.</p><p>\u201cHow many children do you have?\u201d says the turquoise-wrap girl chattily as she squints inside shoes for sizes.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my first.\u201d I gesture to my bump.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely! Just like my friend Saskia.\u201d She gestures at a dark-haired girl who\u2019s standing a few feet away. She\u2019s whippet thin with no sign of pregnancy and is talking intently into a mobile phone. \u201cShe\u2019s only just found out. So exciting!\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Saskia snaps her phone shut and comes toward us, her face glowing.</p><p>\u201cI got in!\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m having Venetia Carter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Saskia! That\u2019s fantastic!\u201d The turquoise-wrap girl drops her basket of clothes right on my foot, and throws her arms around Saskia. \u201cSorry about that!\u201d she gaily adds to me as I hand the basket back. \u201cBut isn\u2019t that great news? Venetia Carter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you with Venetia Carter too?\u201d Saskia asks me with sudden interest.</p><p>I am so out of the baby loop, I have no idea who or what Venetia Carter is.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of her,\u201d I admit.</p> <p>\u201cYou know.\u201d Turquoise-wrap girl opens her eyes wide. \u201cThe obstetrician! The must-have celebrity obstetrician!\u201d</p><p>Must-have celebrity obstetrician?</p><p>My skin starts to prickle. There\u2019s a must-have celebrity obstetrician and I don\u2019t know about it?</p><p>\u201cThe one from Hollywood!\u201d elaborates turquoise-wrap girl. \u201cShe delivers all the film stars\u2019 babies. You must have heard of her. And now she\u2019s moved to London. All the supermodels are going to her. She holds tea parties for her clients \u2014 isn\u2019t that fab? They all bring their babies and get these fabulous goodie bags....\u201d</p><p>My heart is thumping as I listen. Goodie bags? Parties with supermodels? I cannot believe I\u2019m missing out on all this. Why haven\u2019t I heard of Venetia Carter?</p><p>It\u2019s all Luke\u2019s fault. He made us go straight for stuffy old Dr. Braine. We never even considered anyone else.</p><p>\u201cAnd is she good at, you know, delivering babies?\u201d I ask, trying to keep calm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Venetia\u2019s wonderful,\u201d says Saskia, who seems far more intense than her friend. \u201cShe\u2019s not like these old-fashioned doctors. She really connects with you. My boss, Amanda, had the most fabulous holistic water birth with lotus flowers and Thai massage.\u201d</p><p>Thai massage? Dr. Braine\u2019s never even mentioned Thai massage.</p><p>\u201cMy husband won\u2019t pay for her.\u201d Turquoise-wrap girl pouts. \u201cHe\u2019s a meanie. Saskia, you\u2019re so lucky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you get a place with her?\u201d The words come spilling out before I can stop them. \u201cDo you have the address? Or the phone number?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOoh.\u201d Turquoise-wrap girl exchanges doubtful glances with Saskia. \u201cYou\u2019re probably too late now. She\u2019ll be booked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give you this. You could try ringing.\u201d Saskia reaches into her Mulberry bag and produces a brochure with Venetia Carter in elegant raised navy-blue script and a line drawing of a baby. I open it up and the first thing I see is a page of glowing testimonials, with names listed discreetly underneath. All famous! I turn to the back and there\u2019s an address in Maida Vale.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. Maida Vale is where we live. Oh, this is totally meant!</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>As Saskia and her friend move away, I whip out my mobile phone and speed-dial Luke.</p> <p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I exclaim as soon as he answers. \u201cThank God you answered!

I\u2019ve just found out about this brilliant celebrity obstetrician called Venetia Carter. Everyone goes to her and she\u2019s amazing, apparently, and she practices near us! It couldn\u2019t be more perfect! I\u2019m about to call her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, what on earth are you talking about?\u201d Luke sounds incredulous. \u201cWe\u2019re not changing doctors! We have a doctor, remember. A very good one.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t he listening?</p><p>\u201cI know we do,\u201d I say. \u201cBut Venetia Carter delivers all the film stars\u2019 babies! She\u2019s holistic!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018holistic\u2019?\u201d Luke sounds unimpressed. God, he has such a closed mind.</p><p>\u201cI mean everyone has a fabulous birth! She does Thai massage! I just met these two girls in Bambino, and they said\u2014\u201d</p><p>Luke cuts me off. \u201cI really can\u2019t see what advantages this woman could have over Dr. Braine. We know he\u2019s experienced; we know he does a good job; he\u2019s a friend of the family....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but...\u201d I\u2019m hopping with frustration.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stumped. I can\u2019t say, \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t have tea parties with supermodels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want to be treated by a woman!\u201d I exclaim with sudden inspiration. \u201cHad you thought of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll ask Dr. Braine to recommend a colleague,\u201d Luke replies firmly. \u201cBecky, Dr. Braine has been the family obstetrician for years. I really don\u2019t think we should run off to some unknown trendy doctor on the say-so of a couple of girls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut she\u2019s not unknown! That\u2019s the whole point! She treats celebrities!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, just stop.\u201d Luke suddenly sounds forceful. \u201cThis is a bad idea. You\u2019re already halfway through your pregnancy. You\u2019re not changing doctors, end of story. Iain\u2019s here. I have to go. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>The phone goes dead and I stare at it, livid.</p><p>How dare he tell me which doctor I\u2019m going to? And what\u2019s so great about his precious Dr. Braine? I stuff my mobile and the brochure into my bag and start furiously filling my basket with Petit Lapin baby suits.</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t understand anything. If all the movie stars go to her, then she has to be good.</p><p>And it would be so cool. So cool.</p><p>I suddenly have a vision of myself lying in hospital, cradling my new baby, with Kate Winslet in the next bed. And Heidi Klum in the bed beyond that. We\u2019d all become friends! We\u2019d buy each other little presents, and all our babies would be bonded for life, and we\u2019d go to the park together and be photographed by Hello! magazine. Kate Winslet pushes her pram, chatting with a friend.</p><p>Maybe with her best friend, Becky.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, do you need another basket?\u201d A voice interrupts my thoughts, and I look up to see a salesperson gesturing at my overflowing pile of baby clothes. I\u2019ve just been stuffing them into the basket without really noticing.</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d I say in a daze. I take the second wicker basket from him and wander over to a display of tiny hats labeled LITTLE STAR and LITTLE TREASURE.

I move to a quiet corner of the shop and carefully punch in the number.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Venetia Carter\u2019s office,\u201d a woman\u2019s very posh voice answers.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello!\u201d I say, trying to sound as charming as I can. \u201cI\u2019m having a baby in December, and I\u2019ve heard how wonderful Venetia Carter is, and I just wondered if there was any possible chance of me arranging an appointment with her, possibly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the woman says in a firm but polite tone. \u201cDr. Carter is fully booked for the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m really desperate! And I really think I need a holistic water birth. And I live in Maida Vale, and I\u2019d be willing to pay over the odds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Carter is absolutely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d just like to add that I\u2019m a personal shopper, and I\u2019d be pleased to offer Dr. Carter my complimentary services.\u201d The words come tumbling out. \u201cAnd my husband has a PR company and he could do some free PR for her! Not that she probably needs it, of course,\u201d I add hastily. \u201cBut if you could just ask her? Please?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p> <p>\u201cYour name is?\u201d says the woman at last.</p><p>\u201cRebecca Brandon,\u201d I say eagerly. \u201cAnd my husband is Luke Brandon of Brandon Communications, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, please, Mrs. Brandon. Venetia\u2014\u201d Their conversation is cut off by a brisk rendition of The Four Seasons.</p><p>Please let her say yes. Please let her say yes....</p><p>I can hardly breathe as I wait. I\u2019m standing next to a display of white knitted rabbits, crossing my fingers as hard as I can, clutching all my pendants for good measure, and sending silent prayers to the goddess Vishnu, who has been very helpful to me in the past. \u201cMrs. Brandon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d I drop all my pendants. \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s likely that Dr. Carter will have an unexpected vacancy on her books.

Unfortunately it does not qualify for air miles, since it did not buy a ticket for any of these flights.</p><p>I am sorry to disappoint and hope you choose Regal Airlines again soon.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Margaret McNair</p><p>Customer Service Manager</p><p>THREE</p><p>I HAVEN\u2019T MENTIONED ANYTHING more about Venetia Carter to Luke.</p><p>For a start, it\u2019s not definite yet. And for another start, if marriage has taught me one thing, it\u2019s to not bring up tricky subjects when your husband is stressed out launching offices simultaneously in Amsterdam and Munich. He\u2019s been away all week, and only arrived back last night, exhausted.</p><p>Besides which, changing doctors isn\u2019t the only tricky subject I need to broach. There\u2019s also the very slight scratch on the Mercedes (which was not my fault \u2014 it was that stupid bollard) and the two pairs of shoes I want him to get from Miu Miu when he goes to Milan.</p><p>It\u2019s Saturday morning, and I\u2019m sitting in the office, checking my bank statement on my laptop. I only discovered online banking a couple of months ago \u2014 and it has so many advantages. You can do it any time of day! Plus, they don\u2019t send bank statements out by post, so no one (e.g., your husband) can see them lying around the house.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019ve had a letter from my mother.\u201d Luke comes in, holding the post and a mug of coffee. \u201cShe sends her regards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d I try to hide my horror. \u201cYou mean Elinor? What does she want?\u201d</p><p>Luke has two mothers. His lovely, warm stepmother, Annabel, who lives in Devon with his dad and who we visited last month. And his ice-queen of a real mother, Elinor, who lives in America and abandoned him when he was little and in my opinion should be excommunicated.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s touring Europe with her art collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask blankly. I have a vision of Elinor in a coach, a bundle of paintings under her arm. It doesn\u2019t seem very her, somehow.</p><p>\u201cThe collection is currently on loan to the Uffizi, then a gallery in Paris\u2014\u201d Luke breaks off. \u201cBecky, you didn\u2019t think I meant she was taking her pictures on holiday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I say with dignity. \u201cI knew exactly what you meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, she\u2019ll be in London later on in the year and wants to meet up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke...I thought you hated your mother. I thought you never wanted to see her again, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Becky.\u201d Luke frowns slightly. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be the grandmother of our child. We can\u2019t shut her out completely.\u201d</p> <p>Yes we can! I want to retort. But instead, I give an unwilling kind of half shrug. I suppose he\u2019s right. The baby will be her only grandchild. It\u2019ll have her blood in it.</p><p>Oh God, what if it takes after Elinor? I\u2019m stricken by a terrible vision of a baby lying in a pram in a cream Chanel suit, glaring up at me and saying, \u201cYour outfit is shoddy, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you up to?\u201d Luke breaks into my thoughts, and too late I realize he\u2019s heading across the room toward me. Right toward my laptop.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s just my bank statement....\u201d I try to close the window I\u2019m on, but it\u2019s frozen. Damn.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d says Luke.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, panicking slightly. \u201cI mean...I\u2019ll just shut the whole thing down!\u201d I casually rip the power cord out of the back \u2014 but the screen is still powered up. The statement is there, in black and white.</p><p>And Luke\u2019s getting nearer. I\u2019m really not sure I want him seeing this.</p><p>\u201cLet me have a go.\u201d Luke reaches my chair. \u201cAre you on the bank\u2019s Web site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...kind of! Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t bother....\u201d I position my bump in front of the screen, but Luke is peering round me. He stares at the statement for a few disbelieving moments.</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d he says at last. \u201cDoes that say \u2018First Cooperative Bank of Namibia\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...yes.\u201d I try to sound matter-of-fact. \u201cI have a small online account there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn Namibia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sent me an e-mail offering me very competitive rates,\u201d I say a little defiantly. \u201cIt was a great opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you respond to every e-mail you get, Becky?\u201d Luke turns, incredulous. \u201cDo you have a fine selection of Viagra substitutes too?\u201d</p><p>I knew he wouldn\u2019t understand my brilliant new banking strategy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get so stressy!\u201d I say. \u201cWhy is it such a big deal where I bank? Commerce has gone global, you know, Luke. The old boundaries are gone. If you can get a good rate in Bangladesh, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBangladesh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well...er...I\u2019ve got a bank account there too. Just a tiny one,\u201d I add quickly, looking at his expression.</p><p>\u201cBecky...\u201d Luke seems to be having trouble taking all this in. \u201cHow many of these online bank accounts have you opened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cAbout three.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a hard look. The trouble with husbands is, they get to know you too well.</p><p>\u201cOK then, fifteen,\u201d I say in a rush.</p><p>\u201cAnd how many overdrafts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen. What?\u201d I add defensively. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having a bank account if you don\u2019t have an overdraft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen overdrafts?\u201d Luke clutches his head in disbelief. \u201cBecky...you are third world debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m playing the global economy to my advantage!\u201d I retort. \u201cThe Bank of Chad gave me a fifty-dollar bonus just for joining!\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s so blinkered. So what if I have fifteen bank accounts? Everyone knows you shouldn\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to forget, Luke,\u201d I add in lofty tones, \u201cI am a former financial journalist. I know all about money and investment. The bigger the risk, the bigger the profit, I think you\u2019ll find.\u201d</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t look too impressed. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the principles of investment, thank you, Becky,\u201d he says politely.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d I suddenly have a thought. \u201cWe should invest the baby\u2019s trust fund in Bangladesh too. We\u2019d probably make a fortune!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d He stares at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s an emerging market!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Luke rolls his eyes. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve already spoken to Kenneth about the baby\u2019s fund, and we\u2019ve agreed to invest it in a range of secure unit trusts\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d I raise a hand. \u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019ve spoken to Kenneth? What about my opinion?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t believe they haven\u2019t even consulted me! Like I don\u2019t count. Like I didn\u2019t used to be a financial expert on television and get hundreds of letters a week asking for advice.</p><p>\u201cLook, Becky.\u201d Luke sighs. \u201cKenneth is very happy to recommend suitable investments. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point!\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cLuke, you don\u2019t understand. We\u2019re going to be parents. We need to make all important decisions together. Otherwise our child will run around hitting us and we\u2019ll end up hiding in the bedroom and never have sex again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! It\u2019s on Supernanny!\u201d</p><p>Luke looks totally baffled. He really should watch more TV.</p><p>\u201cAll right, fine,\u201d he says at last. \u201cWe can decide things together. But I\u2019m not putting the baby\u2019s trust fund in some high-risk emerging market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not putting it in some stodgy old bank account where it doesn\u2019t make any profit!\u201d I retaliate.</p><p>\u201cStalemate.\u201d Luke\u2019s mouth twitches. \u201cSo...what does Supernanny recommend when parents have fundamentally differing approaches to trust fund investment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure she\u2019s covered it,\u201d I admit. Then a sudden brain wave hits me. \u201cI know. We\u2019ll split up the money. You invest half and I\u2019ll invest half. And we\u2019ll see who does best.\u201d I can\u2019t resist adding, \u201cI bet it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Luke raises his eyebrows. \u201cSo...this is a challenge, is it, Mrs. Brandon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe who dares wins,\u201d I say nonchalantly, and Luke starts to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOK. Let\u2019s do this. Half each, to be invested in anything we choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on,\u201d I say, holding out my hand. We shake gravely, as the phone starts ringing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Luke says, and heads over to his desk. \u201cHello? Oh, hi there. How are you?\u201d</p> <p>I am so going to win this! I\u2019ll pick loads of brilliant investments and make the baby an absolute mint. Maybe I\u2019ll invest in futures. Or gold. Or...art! I just need to find the next Damien Hirst and buy a pickled cow or whatever, and then auction it for a huge profit at Sotheby\u2019s, and everyone will say how farsighted and genius I was....</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Luke is saying. \u201cNo, she never mentioned it. Well, thanks.\u201d He puts down the phone and turns to face me with a quizzical expression. \u201cBecky, that was Giles from the real estate agents. Apparently you had a long talk earlier this week. What exactly did you say to him?\u201d</p><p>Shit. I knew there was another tricky subject I had to broach. I should really start a list.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, that.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI just told Giles we were willing to be more flexible in our requirements.\u201d I straighten some papers on my desk, not looking up. \u201cLike you said. Expand our search area a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit?\u201d echoes Luke incredulously. \u201cTo the Caribbean? He\u2019s sending us the details of eight bloody beach villas and wants to know if we\u2019d like to arrange flights!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said we had to look further afield, Luke!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cIt was your idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant Kensington! Not Barbados!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen what we can get in Barbados?\u201d I counter eagerly. \u201cLook at this!\u201d I push my office chair across the floor to his computer, click on a browser, and find my way onto a Caribbean realty page.</p> <p>Property Web sites are the best thing ever. Especially the ones with virtual tours.</p><p>\u201cSee this one?\u201d I point at the screen. \u201cFive bedroom villa with infinity pool, sunken garden, and guest cottage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky...\u201d Luke pauses, as though thinking how to explain the situation to me. \u201cIt\u2019s in Barbados.\u201d</p><p>He is so hung up on that one detail.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019d be fab! The baby would learn to swim, and you could send all your e-mails from the guest cottage...and I could go running on the beach every day....\u201d</p><p>I have an alluring image of myself in a string bikini, pushing one of those jogger prams along a glistening white Caribbean beach. And Luke would be all tanned in a polo shirt, drinking a rum punch. He could get into surfing, and put beads in his hair again\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting beads in my hair again.\u201d Luke interrupts my thoughts.</p><p>That\u2019s so spooky! How on earth did he...</p><p>Oh, OK. I possibly may have shared my Caribbean fantasy with him before.</p><p>\u201cLook, sweetheart,\u201d he says, sitting down. \u201cMaybe in five, ten years\u2019 time we can think about something like this. If things go to plan, we\u2019ll have a lot of options by then.

In case we were \u2018still considering London,\u2019 as he put it. It\u2019s just come on the market, round the corner from here. Delamain Road. But we need to be quick.\u201d</p> <p>I scan the first page, taking in the words as fast as I can.</p><p>Elegant family house...ideal for entertaining...grand entrance hall...magnificent luxury kitchen...</p><p>Wow. I have to admit, this looks amazing.</p><p>Garden with architect-designed play area...six bedrooms...dressing room with walk-in shoe cupboard...</p><p>I catch my breath. A walk-in shoe cupboard! But surely that\u2019s just another way of saying\u2014</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s even got a Shoe Room.\u201d Luke is watching me with a grin. \u201cGiles was pretty pleased about that. Shall we go and see it?\u201d</p><p>I am so excited about this house! And not just because of the Shoe Room. I\u2019ve read the details over and over, and I can just see Luke and me living there. Taking a shower in the frameless limestone RainJet cubicle...making coffee in the Bulthaup kitchen with its state-of-the-art appliances...and then maybe strolling out into the secluded west-facing garden with its range of mature specimen shrubs. Whatever they are.</p><p>It\u2019s later that day and we\u2019re walking along the leafy Maida Vale road on the way to our appointment to view it. I\u2019m clutching the printout of the details in my hand, but I barely need to; I practically know them by heart.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four...twenty-six...\u201d Luke is squinting at the numbers as we pass. \u201cIt\u2019ll be on the other side of the road....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere it is!\u201d I stop dead and point across the street. \u201cLook, there\u2019s the impressive pillared entrance and double doors with attractive fanlight! It looks fab! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s hand holds me back as I\u2019m about to hurry across the road. \u201cBecky, before we go in, just a word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m tugging at his hand like a dog trying to get off the leash. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to play it cool, OK? We don\u2019t want to look too keen.

I can play it cool.</p><p>But as we head across the road and up to the front door, my heart\u2019s hammering.

This hall is huge. And the sweeping staircase is like something out of Hollywood! I immediately have an image of myself trailing down it in a fantastic evening dress while Luke waits admiringly at the bottom.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had fashion shoots here,\u201d says Fabia, gesturing at the staircase. \u201cThe marble is imported from Italy and the chandelier is antique Murano.

I\u2019m trying as hard as I can not to look overawed as Fabia runs through the appliances. \u201cTriple oven...chef\u2019s hob...This is a rotating multisurface chopping area....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d I run a hand over the granite with a jaded air. \u201cDo you have a built-in electric sushi maker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says as though I\u2019ve asked something really obvious.</p><p>It has a built-in electric sushi maker!</p> <p>Oh God, it\u2019s just spectacular. And so is the terrace with built-in summer kitchen and barbecue. And the drawing room fitted out with David Linley shelves. As we follow Fabia upstairs to the main bedroom I\u2019m practically expiring, trying not to exclaim at everything.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the dressing room....\u201d Fabia shows us into a smallroom lined with paneled walnut wardrobes. \u201cThis is my customized shoe cupboard....\u201d She opens the door and we walk in.</p><p>I feel faint. Either side of us are rows and rows of shoes, lined up immaculately on suede-lined shelves. Louboutins...Blahniks...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing!\u201d I blurt out. \u201cAnd look, we\u2019re the same size and everything. This is so meant to be\u2014\u201d Luke casts me a warning glance. \u201cI mean...yeah.\u201d I give an offhand shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got kids?\u201d Fabia glances at my stomach as we move away.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re expecting one in December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got two at boarding school.\u201d She rips a Nicorette patch off her arm, frowns at it, and drops it in a bin. Then she reaches in her jeans pocket and produces a packet of Marlboro Lights. \u201cThey\u2019re on the top floor now but their nurseries are still done up if you\u2019re interested.\u201d She flicks a lighter and takes a puff.</p><p>\u201cNurseries?\u201d echoes Luke, glancing at me. \u201cMore than one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis and hers. We had one of each. Never got round to redecorating. This is my son\u2019s....\u201d She pushes open a white-paneled door.</p><p>I stand there, open-mouthed. It\u2019s like fairyland. The walls are painted with a mural of green hills and blue sky and woods and teddy bears having a picnic. In one corner is a painted crib in the shape of a castle; in the other is a real little red wooden train on tracks, big enough to sit on, with a toy in each carriage.</p><p>I feel an overwhelming stab of desire. I want a boy. I so want a little boy.</p> <p>\u201cAnd my daughter\u2019s is over here,\u201d Fabia continues.</p><p>I can barely tear myself away from the boy\u2019s nursery, but I follow her across the landing as she opens the door \u2014 and can\u2019t help gasping.</p><p>I have never seen anything so beautiful. It\u2019s a little girl\u2019s dream. The walls are decorated with hand-painted fairies, the white curtains are looped back with huge lilac taffeta bows, and the little cradle is festooned with broderie anglaise frills like a princess\u2019s bed.</p><p>Oh God. Now I want a girl.</p><p>I want both. Can\u2019t I have both?</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Fabia turns to me.</p><p>There\u2019s silence on the landing. I can\u2019t speak for longing. I want these nurseries more than I have ever wanted anything, ever. I want this whole house. I want to live here and have our first Christmas here as a family, and decorate a huge pine tree in the black-and-white hall, and hang a tiny stocking above the fireplace....</p><p>\u201cPretty nice,\u201d I manage at last, with a small shrug. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Fabia draws on her cigarette. \u201cLet\u2019s show you the rest.\u201d</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m floating as we progress through all the other rooms. We\u2019ve found our house. We\u2019ve found it.</p><p>\u201cMake her an offer!\u201d I whisper to Luke as we\u2019re peering into the hot water cupboard. \u201cTell her we want it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, slow down.\u201d He gives a little laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way to negotiate. We haven\u2019t even seen it all yet.\u201d</p><p>But I can tell he loves it too. His eyes are bright, and as we come down to the hall again he\u2019s asking questions about the neighbors.</p><p>\u201cWell...thanks,\u201d he says at last, shaking Fabia\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch through the estate agent.\u201d</p><p>How can he restrain himself? Why isn\u2019t he getting out his checkbook?</p><p>\u201cThank you very much,\u201d I add, and am about to shake Fabia\u2019s hand myself when there\u2019s the sound of a key at the front door. A tanned man in his fifties comes in, wearing jeans and a leather jacket and carrying a cool art-portfolio \u2014 type thing.</p><p>\u201cHi, there.\u201d He looks from face to face, clearly wondering if he\u2019s supposed to know us. \u201cHow are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDarling, these are the Brandons,\u201d says Fabia. \u201cThey\u2019ve been looking round the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Through Hamptons?\u201d He frowns. \u201cI would have called if I\u2019d known. I accepted an offer ten minutes ago. Through the other agent.\u201d</p><p>I feel a shot of horror. He\u2019s done what?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make you an offer right now!\u201d I blurt out. \u201cWe\u2019ll offer the asking price!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s done.\u201d He shrugs and takes off his jacket. \u201cThose Americans who looked round this morning,\u201d he adds to Fabia.</p><p>No. No. We can\u2019t be losing our dream house!</p><p>\u201cLuke, do something.\u201d I try to speak calmly. \u201cMake an offer! Quick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d Fabia looks surprised. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem that keen on the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were playing cool!\u201d I wail, all semblance of nonchalance vanishing. \u201cLuke, I knew we should have said something earlier! We love the house! I adore the nurseries! We want it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d very much like to offer above the asking price,\u201d says Luke, stepping forward. \u201cWe can act with the utmost speed and have our solicitor contact yours in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, as far as I\u2019m concerned, the house has gone,\u201d says Fabia\u2019s husband, rolling his eyes. \u201cI need a drink. Good luck with your search.\u201d He strides away, over the tiles toward the kitchen, and I hear a fridge opening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Fabia says with a shrug, and leads us toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I trail off helplessly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s OK. If the deal falls through, please let us know.\u201d Luke gives her a polite smile and slowly we walk out into the mild autumn afternoon. Leaves are drifting off the trees onto the paved path and I can smell a bonfire in the air.</p><p>I could just see myself living on this street. Pushing the baby along in a pram, waving to all the neighbors...</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d My voice is a little choked.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a house.\u201d Luke puts his arm round my slumped shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ll find another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t. We won\u2019t ever find a place like that. It was the perfect house!\u201d I stop, my hand on the wrought-iron gate. I can\u2019t just give up. I\u2019m not some lame giver-upper.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d I say to Luke, swiveling on my heel. I rush back along the path, up the steps, and plant a foot in the door before Fabia can close it.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I say urgently. \u201cPlease. Fabia, we really, really love your house. We\u2019ll pay anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s already done the deal.\u201d She shrinks back. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can talk him round! What can I do to persuade you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d She sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to me. Could you please move your feet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do anything!\u201d I cry in desperation. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you something! I work at a fashion store, I can get really cool stuff\u2014\u201d</p><p>I break off. Fabia is peering at my foot, jammed in the door. Then she looks at the other one.</p><p>It\u2019s not my feet she\u2019s interested in, it\u2019s my Archie Swann cowboy boots in beaten-up calfskin with the leather drawstring. Archie Swann is the new kid on the shoe block, and these exact boots were in Vogue last week, under \u201cMost Coveted.\u201d I saw Fabia checking them out the moment we arrived.</p><p>Fabia raises her eyes to mine. \u201cI like your boots,\u201d she says.</p><p>I\u2019m momentarily speechless.</p><p>Play it cool, Becky, play it cool.</p><p>\u201cI waited a whole year for these boots,\u201d I say at last, feeling as though I\u2019m treading on eggshells. \u201cYou can\u2019t get them anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the waiting list at Harvey Nichols,\u201d she bats back.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I force a casual tone. \u201cBut you won\u2019t get them. They only made fifty pairs and they\u2019ve run out. I\u2019m a personal shopper, so I know these things.\u201d</p><p>I am totally bluffing here. But I think it\u2019s working. She\u2019s practically salivating over them.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Luke is coming back up the path toward me. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I lift a hand. \u201cStay there!\u201d I feel like Obi-Wan Kenobi telling Luke Skywalker not to interfere because he doesn\u2019t understand the strength of the Force.</p><p>I wriggle out of my left boot, leaving it standing on the doormat like a totem.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you accept our offer. And the other one when we exchange contracts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the agent tomorrow,\u201d says Fabia, sounding almost breathless. \u201cI\u2019ll talk my husband round. The house is yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I did it!

Why are you only wearing one boot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...just a bit of negotiation,\u201d I say airily, and glance back at the front door. Fabia has already kicked off her gold ballet pump and thrust her jean-clad leg into the boot. Now she\u2019s turning it from side to side, fixated. \u201cIf you call the agent in the morning, I think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>We don\u2019t even need to wait until the next morning.

Really?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m making faces at him, trying to get him to tell me what\u2019s going on, but he\u2019s keeping his eyes firmly on the road, which is really annoying. At last he switches the phone off and turns to me with the tiniest of smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I squeal in delight. \u201cI told you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re relocating to New York and want to move as soon as possible. I said we could complete by December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have our new baby in our gorgeous new house in time for Christmas.\u201d I hug myself. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be perfect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good news.\u201d His face is glowing. \u201cAnd all down to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d I say modestly. \u201cJust good negotiating.\u201d I get out my mobile phone and am about to text Suze the good news, when all of a sudden it rings.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I say joyfully into it.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brandon? It\u2019s Diane from Venetia Carter\u2019s office here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I stiffen, and glance at Luke. \u201cEr...hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to let you know that the vacancy has arisen on Dr. Carter\u2019s books. She would be very pleased to see you \u2014 and your husband if you wish \u2014 on Thursday at three P.M.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, a little breathless. \u201cUm...yes, please. I\u2019ll be there! Thank you very much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Good-bye, Mrs. Brandon.\u201d</p><p>The line goes dead and I switch the phone off with trembling hands. I\u2019ve got a place with Venetia Carter! I\u2019m going to meet celebrities and have holistic Thai massage!</p><p>Now I just have to break the news to Luke.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d says Luke, turning on the radio. He frowns at the digital display and presses a couple of buttons.</p><p>\u201cIt was...um...\u201d I drop my phone accidentally-on-purpose on the floor and bend down to retrieve it.</p> <p>It\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019s in a good mood about the house and everything. I\u2019ll just tell him and that will be that. And if he starts objecting, I shall point out that I\u2019m a grown-up mature woman who can choose her own medical care. Exactly.</p><p>\u201cEr...Luke.\u201d I sit up again, a bit red in the face. \u201cAbout Dr. Braine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d Luke pulls into another lane. \u201cBy the way, I told my mother we\u2019d organize a dinner with him and David.\u201d</p><p>A dinner? Oh God, this gets worse. I have to tell him, quick.</p><p>\u201cLuke, listen.\u201d I wait until he slows down behind a truck. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking very hard and doing some research.\u201d</p><p>Research sounds good. Even if it was just reading a piece about Hollywood baby trends on fashionmommies.com.</p><p>\u201cAnd the thing is...\u201d I swallow. \u201cI want to go to Venetia Carter.\u201d</p><p>Luke makes an impatient noise. \u201cBecky, not this again. I thought we\u2019d agreed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a place with her,\u201d I say in a rush. \u201cI\u2019ve made an appointment. It\u2019s all fixed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve what?\u201d He brakes at a traffic light and turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my body!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI can see whoever I like!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, we are lucky enough to have one of the most respected, renowned obstetricians in the country looking after you, and you\u2019re messing around with some unknown woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the millionth time, she\u2019s not unknown!\u201d I exclaim in frustration. \u201cShe\u2019s huge in Hollywood! She\u2019s modern and she\u2019s in touch, and she does these amazing water births with lotus flowers....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLotus flowers? She sounds a total bloody charlatan.\u201d Luke angrily jabs his foot down on the accelerator. \u201cI won\u2019t have you risking the health of yourself and the baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be a charlatan!\u201d</p><p>I should never have mentioned the lotus flowers.

Wow. Maybe we should get one of those. I squint, trying to see what the logo is.</p><p>It\u2019s amazing, I never used to even notice prams before. Now I can\u2019t stop checking them out, even when I\u2019m in the middle of a row with my husband.</p><p>Discussion. Not row.</p><p>\u201cLuke, listen,\u201d I say as we move off again. \u201cIn my book it says the pregnant woman should always follow her instincts. Well, my instincts are saying really strongly, \u2018Go to Venetia Carter.\u2019 It\u2019s nature telling me!\u201d</p> <p>Luke is silent. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s frowning at the road or at what I\u2019m saying.</p><p>\u201cWe could just go once to check her out,\u201d I say appeasingly. \u201cOne little appointment. If we hate her we don\u2019t have to go back.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve reached Mum and Dad\u2019s drive. There\u2019s a big silver banner over the door, and a stray helium balloon reading Happy 60th Birthday, Jane! lands lightly on the bonnet as we pull in.</p><p>\u201cAnd I got us the house,\u201d I can\u2019t help adding. Even though I know it isn\u2019t strictly relevant.</p><p>Luke parks the car behind a van with OXSHOTT SPECIAL EVENTS printed on the side and finally turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cOK, Becky.\u201d He sighs. \u201cYou win. We\u2019ll go and see her.\u201d</p> <p>FOUR</p><p>TO SAY THAT MUM IS EXCITED about the baby is a bit of an understatement. As we get out of the car she flies across the drive, her hair blow-dried for the party, her face all pink with excitement.</p><p>\u201cBecky! How\u2019s my little grandchild!\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t even bother looking at my face anymore. Her attention is straight on the bump. \u201cIt\u2019s getting bigger! Can you hear Grandma?\u201d She bends closer. \u201cCan you hear Grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Jane,\u201d says Luke politely. \u201cMaybe we could come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d She snaps up again and ushers us inside the house. \u201cCome in! Put your feet up, Becky! Have a cup of tea. Graham!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Dad appears down the stairs. \u201cBecky!\u201d He gives me a tight hug. \u201cCome and sit down. Suze is here with the children\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready!\u201d I exclaim in delight. I haven\u2019t seen Suze for ages. I follow my parents into the sitting room to find Suze on the sofa next to Janice, Mum and Dad\u2019s next-door neighbor. Her blond hair is up in a knot and she\u2019s breast-feeding one of her twins. Meanwhile Janice is wriggling uncomfortably, clearly trying very hard not to look.</p> <p>\u201cBex!\u201d Suze\u2019s face lights up. \u201cOh my God! You look fantastic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I give her a great big hug, trying not to squash the baby. \u201cHow are you? And how\u2019s darling little Clemmie?\u201d I kiss the blond little head.</p><p>\u201cThis is Wilfrid,\u201d says Suze, going a bit pink.</p><p>Damn. I always get it wrong. And to make things worse, Suze is totally paranoid that Wilfrid looks like a girl. (Which he does. Especially in that lacy romper thing.)</p><p>I quickly change the subject. \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tarkie\u2019s got them,\u201d says Suze, looking vaguely out the window. I follow her gaze and see her husband, Tarquin, pushing my godson, Ernie, around the marquee in a wheelbarrow, with Clementine strapped to his chest.</p><p>\u201cMore!\u201d Ernie\u2019s shrieking voice comes faintly through the window. \u201cMore, Dada!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be you in a few months, Luke,\u201d I say with a grin.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d He raises his eyebrows and gets out his BlackBerry. \u201cI need to send some e-mails. I\u2019ll do it upstairs, if that\u2019s OK?\u201d</p><p>He heads out of the room and I sit on a squashy chair near Suze. \u201cSo, guess what?

That makes me A-list!</p><p>\u201cShe does all the supermodels and film stars,\u201d I can\u2019t help boasting. \u201cThey have tea parties and designer goodie bags and everything.

I had to beg to get a place with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t forget us, love, when you\u2019re famous!\u201d says Mum.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t! Hey, do you want to see the scan?\u201d I fish in my bag, produce the roll of pictures, and hand it to Mum.</p><p>\u201cLook at that!\u201d she breathes, gazing at the blurry image. \u201cLook, Graham! Our first little grandchild. It looks just like my mother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d retorts Dad incredulously, grabbing the prints from her. \u201cAre you blind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019ve knitted a few bits and pieces for the baby,\u201d Janice puts in timidly. \u201cSome little matinee jackets...a shawl...a Noah\u2019s Ark set...I made three of each animal, just in case of mishap....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanice, that\u2019s so kind of you,\u201d I say, touched.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble, love!

Of course, I always hoped that Tom and Lucy might...\u201d Janice trails off with a brave, bright smile. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Tom?\u201d I ask cautiously.</p> <p>Tom is Janice\u2019s son. He\u2019s about the same age as me, and got married three years ago, in this big, fancy wedding. But then it all went a bit wrong. His wife, Lucy, got a tattoo and ran off with a guy who lived in a caravan, and Tom turned very weird and started building a summerhouse in his parents\u2019 back garden.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tom\u2019s very well! He lives mainly in the summerhouse now. We leave him food on trays.\u201d Janice looks a little beleaguered. \u201cHe says he\u2019s writing a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d I say encouragingly. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe state of society.\u201d She swallows. \u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as we all digest this.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of state does he think society\u2019s in?\u201d asks Suze.</p><p>\u201cNot very good,\u201d whispers Janice.</p><p>\u201cHave another cup of tea, Janice, love.\u201d Mum pats her hand comfortingly. \u201cOr a sherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a small sherry,\u201d says Janice after a pause. \u201cI\u2019ll help myself.\u201d</p><p>As she heads across the room to the drinks cabinet, Mum puts down her cup. \u201cNow, Becky,\u201d she says. \u201cDid you bring all your catalogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d I reach for the bag I brought in with me. \u201cI\u2019ve got Blooming Marvellous, Great Little Trading Company, The Little White Company....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought JoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9,\u201d chimes in Suze. \u201cAnd Italian Baby Cashmere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got all of those.\u201d Mum nods, reaching for a stack of catalogs in the magazine rack. \u201cHave you got Funky Baba?\u201d She waves a catalog bearing a picture of a baby in a clown costume. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOoh!\u201d says Suze. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take that,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll take Petit Enfant. Mum, you do Luxury Baby.\u201d</p><p>With a happy sigh we all settle down to flicking through images of infants on playmats and wearing cute Tshirts and being toted in stylish baby carriers. Honestly, it\u2019s worth having a baby just for all the gorgeous stuff.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll turn down the corner of the page if I see something you should get,\u201d says Mum in a businesslike way.</p> <p>\u201cOK, me too,\u201d I say, fixated on a spread of babies dressed up as animals. We have to get the baby a polar bear snowsuit. I turn down the corner and flip to the next page, which is full of adorable miniature ski-wear. And look at the tiny pom-pom hats!</p><p>\u201cLuke, I think we should take the baby skiing from really early on,\u201d I say as he enters the room. \u201cIt\u2019ll help its development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkiing?\u201d He looks taken aback. \u201cBecky, I thought you hated skiing.\u201d</p><p>I do hate skiing.</p><p>Maybe we could go to Val d\u2019ls\u00e8re or somewhere and wear the cool clothes and just not ski.</p> <p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Mum interrupts my thoughts. \u201cLook at this crib. It has a built-in temperature control, lullaby light show, and soothing vibrating action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I breathe, looking at the picture. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! How much is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deluxe version is...twelve hundred pounds,\u201d says Mum, consulting the text.</p><p>\u201cTwelve hundred pounds?\u201d Luke nearly chokes on his cup of tea. \u201cFor a crib? Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s state of the art,\u201d points out Suze. \u201cIt uses NASA technology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNASA technology?\u201d He gives an incredulous snort. \u201cAre we planning to send the baby into space?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want the best for your child, Luke?\u201d I retort. \u201cWhat do you think, Janice?\u201d</p><p>I look across the room, but Janice hasn\u2019t heard me.

But Tom never even comes out of his summerhouse. And when he does...\u201d She lowers her voice further. \u201cHe can\u2019t have had a haircut in months! And talk about shaving! I said to her, \u2018He\u2019ll never find a nice girl if he doesn\u2019t spruce up his appearance!\u2019 But\u2014\u201d She breaks off as the doorbell rings. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the caterers. I\u2019ve told them to use the kitchen door!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Dad gets up, and we all turn back to the catalogs.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you think we should get a bath seat and a bath support?\u201d I peer at the page. \u201cAnd an inflatable travel bath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet this.\u201d Suze shows me a picture of a padded baby nest. \u201cThey\u2019re fab.

He\u2019s being funny. Ha-di-ha. I\u2019m about to come up with a crushing retort, when Dad\u2019s voice rings out from the hall. \u201cCome on through, Jess. Everyone\u2019s having tea.\u201d</p><p>Jess is here!</p><p>Oh God. Jess is here.</p><p>\u201cQuick, hide the catalogs!\u201d I hiss, and start shoving them behind cushions in a nervous scrabble. \u201cYou know what Jess is like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she might want to have a look, love!\u201d Mum objects.</p><p>Mum doesn\u2019t really get Jess and her whole thriftiness thing. She thinks Jess is just going through a \u201cphase,\u201d like when Suze was a committed vegan for about three weeks before totally caving in and stuffing her face with a bacon sandwich.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t,\u201d says Suze, who has stayed in Jess\u2019s house and knows what she\u2019s like. She grabs Mum\u2019s copy of Funky Baba and pushes it under Wilfrid\u2019s bouncy chair just as Dad and Jess appear at the door.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jess!\u201d I begin brightly, then stop in amazement. I haven\u2019t seen Jess for a couple of months and she looks absolutely spectacular!</p><p>She\u2019s all tanned and skinny and wearing cargo shorts that show off her long, toned legs. Her cropped hair has been bleached by the sun and her green sleeveless T-shirt brings out her hazel eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d she says, putting down her backpack. \u201cHi, Auntie Jane.

You\u2019re so tanned!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jess glances down at herself with zero interest, then reaches in her backpack. \u201cI brought some maize biscuits. They\u2019re made by a local cooperative in northern Guatemala.\u201d She hands Mum a box made out of rough cardboard, and Mum turns it in her fingers, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cLovely, dear,\u201d she says at last, and puts it down next to the teapot. \u201cHave a fondant fancy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d Jess sits down on the ottoman. \u201cLook at Clem\u2014\u201d She stops as I mouth \u201cWilfie!\u201d behind Suze\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cI was just going to ask...where\u2019s Clementine?\u201d Jess amends. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe Wilfie! He\u2019s huge!\u201d</p><p>I give her a tiny grin over my cup of tea as Suze replies. God, who would have thought it? My sister and my best friend, chatting away together.</p><p>There was a time when I thought I\u2019d lost both of them for good. Jess, because we had a great big row, and called each other names which make me wince even now to remember them. And Suze because she made a new friend called Lulu, who rides horses and has four children and thinks she\u2019s superior to everyone. I still can\u2019t understand why Suze likes her; in fact, it\u2019s the one subject we don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something for you too, Becky.\u201d Jess delves into her backpack and produces a bunch of grubby rags. Janice recoils with a little cry of dismay.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky and I are going to make baby wipes,\u201d says Jess.</p><p>\u201cMake baby wipes?\u201d Mum looks uncomprehending. \u201cBut love, Boots do them. You can get them in the three-for-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey look a little...used,\u201d ventures Janice.</p><p>\u201cWe just need to boil them and soak them in a solution of oil and soap,\u201d Jess informs her. \u201cIt\u2019s far kinder to the environment. And to the baby\u2019s skin. And they\u2019re reusable. You\u2019ll save pounds in the long run.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr...fab.\u201d I gulp, and finger the rags, one of which has HM WANDSWORTH PRISON printed faintly down the side. There is no way on earth I\u2019m having a bucket of grotty old rags in my baby\u2019s nursery. But Jess seems so enthusiastic. I don\u2019t want to hurt her feelings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you make a baby carrier too,\u201d she says. \u201cOut of a pair of Luke\u2019s old jeans. It\u2019s really simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea!\u201d I manage. I daren\u2019t look at Luke.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve had another idea.\u201d Jess swivels on the ottoman to face me. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say yes, but maybe you could think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say nervously. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you give a talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA talk?\u201d I\u2019m taken aback. \u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn how you kicked your spending addiction.\u201d Jess leans forward, her face all warm and sisterly. \u201cI have a friend who\u2019s a counselor and I was telling her about you and how much you\u2019ve changed. She said she thought you\u2019d be an inspiration to a lot of the addicts in her group.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence in the room. I can feel my face going puce.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Bex.\u201d Suze nudges my foot. \u201cYou\u2019d be great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d says Luke. \u201cWhen is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t need to be formal,\u201d says Jess. \u201cJust a friendly chat about resisting consumer pressure. Especially now that you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, the amount of rubbish people feel compelled to buy for their children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blame the catalogs,\u201d says Luke gravely.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think, Becky?\u201d persists Jess.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really...\u201d I clear my throat feebly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed!\u201d Jess gets up from the ottoman and comes to sit beside me on the sofa. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you, Becky. And you should be proud of yourself\u2014\u201d Her expression changes and she shifts on the sofa. \u201cWhat am I sitting on? What\u2019s this?\u201d She reaches behind her and pulls out two glossy catalogs, with all the corners folded down.</p><p>Shit. And she would have picked out Luxury Baby, which has a cover picture of a baby dressed in Ralph Lauren, holding a Dior bottle and sitting in a miniature Rolls-Royce.</p><p>\u201cBecky wasn\u2019t looking at those,\u201d says Suze in a rush. \u201cThey\u2019re not even hers.

Why don\u2019t you come back for tea, and you and Tom can carry on with your little talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jess looks taken aback. \u201cWell...I\u2019ve come to see everyone here....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see them later at the party!\u201d Janice takes a firm grip on Jess\u2019s tanned arm and starts chivvying her toward the door. \u201cJane, Graham, you don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d says Dad easily.</p><p>\u201cWell, OK.\u201d Jess glances at Tom and a faint rosy color appears on her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d we all chorus.</p><p>The door closes behind them and we all look at each other in suppressed glee.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d says Mum, picking up the teapot. \u201cNow, wouldn\u2019t that be nice! We could take down the fence and have a marquee across both lawns!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum! Honestly!\u201d I roll my eyes. That is just like her, getting ahead of herself and imagining all sorts of ridiculous\u2014</p><p>Ooh. The baby could be the ring bearer!</p><p>While Jess is next door, Luke is reading the paper, and Tarquin is bathing the children, Suze and I take over my old bedroom. We turn on the radio loudly and run deep, sudsy baths, and take turns perching on the edge of the tub to chat, just like in the old days in Fulham. Then Suze sits on the bed, feeding the babies in turn while I paint my toenails. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to do that for much longer,\u201d says Suze, watching me.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I look up in alarm. \u201cIs it bad for the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you dope!\u201d She laughs. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to reach!\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a weird thought.

Tarquin is so sweet. When I first knew him he was totally weird and geeky and I couldn\u2019t even hold a conversation with him \u2014 but somehow he\u2019s got more and more normal as the years have gone by.</p><p>He looks blankly at my nails. \u201cMarvelous. Come on, old chap.\u201d He pats Wilfie gently on the back. \u201cUp to Bedfordshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarkie\u2019s such a good dad,\u201d I say in admiration as he disappears out of the room.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s great,\u201d says Suze fondly as she starts feeding Clementine. \u201cExcept he keeps playing Wagner at them all the time. Ernie can sing Brunnehilde\u2019s aria from start to finish in German, but he can\u2019t speak much English.\u201d Her brow crumples. \u201cI\u2019m getting a bit worried, actually.\u201d</p><p>I take it back. Tarquin is still weird.</p><p>I get out my new mascara and start applying it to my lashes, watching Suze make funny faces at Clementine and kissing her fat little cheeks. She\u2019s so lovely with her children.</p> <p>\u201cD\u2019you think I\u2019ll be a good mother, Suze?\u201d The words pop out of my mouth before I even realize I\u2019m thinking them.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Suze stares at me in the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a brilliant mother! You\u2019ll be kind, and you\u2019ll be funny, and you\u2019ll be the best-dressed one in the playground....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know anything about babies. I mean, honestly, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor did I, remember.\u201d Suze shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019ll soon pick it up!\u201d</p><p>Everyone keeps saying I\u2019ll pick it up. But what if I don\u2019t? I did algebra for three years, and I never picked that up.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you give me some parenting tips?\u201d I put away my mascara wand. \u201cLike...things I should know.\u201d</p><p>Suze wrinkles her brow in thought. \u201cThe only tips I can think of are the real basics,\u201d she says at last. \u201cYou know, the ones that go without saying.\u201d</p><p>I feel a twinge of alarm.</p> <p>\u201cLike what, exactly?\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cI mean, I probably know about them already....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know.\u201d She counts off on her fingers. \u201cThings like having a bit of first aid knowledge...making sure you\u2019ve got all your equipment...You might want to book a baby massage class....\u201d She hoists Clementine onto her shoulder. \u201cAre you doing Baby Einstein?\u201d</p><p>OK, now I\u2019m freaked out. I\u2019ve never heard of Baby Einstein.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Bex!\u201d says Suze hastily, seeing my face. \u201cNone of that really matters. As long as you can change a nappy and sing a nursery rhyme, you\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t change a nappy. And I don\u2019t know any nursery rhymes.</p><p>God, I\u2019m in trouble.</p><p>It\u2019s another twenty minutes before Suze finishes feeding Clementine and hands her over to Tarquin.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d She closes the door behind him and turns with sparkling eyes. \u201cNo one\u2019s about. Give me your wedding ring. I just need some string or something....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I rummage in my dressing table for an old Christian Dior gift-wrap ribbon. \u201cWill this do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould do.\u201d Suze is stringing the ribbon through the ring. \u201cNow, Becky. Are you sure you want to know?\u201d</p><p>I feel a flicker of doubt. Maybe Luke\u2019s right. Maybe we should wait for the magical surprise. But then \u2014 how will I know what color pram to get?</p><p>\u201cI want to know,\u201d I say with resolution. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit back, then.\u201d Suze knots the ribbon, meets my eye, and grins. \u201cThis is exciting!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suze is the best.

It\u2019s a girl!\u201d</p><p>I gasp. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! You\u2019re having a daughter! Congratulations!\u201d Suze flings her arms round me.</p> <p>It\u2019s a girl. I feel quite shaky. I\u2019m having a daughter! I knew it. I\u2019ve been having girl vibes all along.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d The door opens and Mum is standing there, resplendent in purple sequins and matching lurid lipstick. \u201cPeople will be here soon.\u201d Her eyes shoot from Suze to me. \u201cIs everything all right, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, I\u2019m having a girl!\u201d I blurt it out before I can stop myself. \u201cSuze did the ring test! It went in a circle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl!\u201d Mum\u2019s whole face lights up. \u201cI thought it looked like a girl! Oh, Becky, love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a granddaughter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get out your old doll\u2019s house, Becky!\u201d Mum is suffused with delight. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have the spare room painted pink....\u201d She comes close and examines my bump. \u201cYes, look at the way you\u2019re carrying it, love. It\u2019s definitely a girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd watch the ring!\u201d says Suze. She lifts the ribbon above my stomach again and steadies it. There\u2019s utter stillness \u2014 then the ring starts moving back and forth. For a moment no one speaks.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said a circle,\u201d says Mum at last, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI did! Suze, what\u2019s happening? Why\u2019s it going back and forth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno!\u201d She peers at the ring, her brow wrinkled. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a boy after all.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re all staring at my stomach as though we\u2019re expecting it to start talking to us.</p><p>\u201cYou are carrying high,\u201d says Mum eventually. \u201cIt could be a boy.\u201d</p><p>A minute ago she said it looked like a girl. Oh, for God\u2019s sake. The thing about old wives\u2019 tales is, they\u2019re actually total crap.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go down anyway, loves,\u201d Mum says, as music suddenly blasts from downstairs. \u201cKeith from the Fox and Grapes has arrived. He\u2019s making all sorts of fancy cocktails.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d says Suze, reaching for her sponge bag. \u201cWe\u2019ll be down in a sec.\u201d</p><p>Mum leaves the room, and Suze starts applying makeup at speed while I watch in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, Suze! Are you training for the makeup Olympics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wait,\u201d says Suze, brushing sparkly shadow onto her eyelids. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to do your makeup in three seconds flat too.\u201d She unscrews her lipstick and slashes it on. \u201cDone!\u201d She grabs her elegant green satin dress and steps into it, then takes a jeweled hair clasp from her bag and twists her blond hair into a knot.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice!\u201d I say, admiring the clasp.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She hesitates. \u201cLulu gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Now that I look at it again, it isn\u2019t that nice. \u201cSo...how is Lulu?\u201d I force myself to say politely.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine!\u201d Suze\u2019s face is lowered as she wrenches her hair into place. \u201cShe\u2019s written a book, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA book?\u201d Lulu never struck me as the book type.</p><p>\u201cOn cooking for your children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cWell, maybe I should read that. Is it good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t read it yet,\u201d says Suze after a pause. \u201cBut obviously she\u2019s the expert, with four of them....\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a kind of tension in her voice that I can\u2019t place. But then Suze looks up \u2014 and her hair is such a terrible mess, we both burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cLet me do it.\u201d I grab the clasp, take it out of the knotted hair, brush it all out, and twist it up again, pulling little tendrils out at the front.</p><p>\u201cFab.\u201d Suze gives me a hug. \u201cThanks, Bex. And now I\u2019m dying for a cosmo. Come on!\u201d</p><p>She practically gallops out of the room, and I follow her down the stairs with slightly less enthusiasm. I guess mine will be a Virgin Fruity Bland Something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I mean, obviously I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m creating a beautiful new human being and all that. But still. If I were God, I\u2019d make it OK for pregnant women to have cocktails. In fact, I\u2019d make it healthy to have cocktails. And your arms wouldn\u2019t swell up. And there wouldn\u2019t be any morning sickness. And labor wouldn\u2019t exist....</p><p>Thinking about it, I\u2019d pretty much have a whole different system altogether.</p><p>Even on virgin cocktails, it\u2019s a fabulous party. By midnight the marquee is full, and we\u2019ve all had a delicious dinner. Dad has made a speech about how wonderful Mum is, as a wife and as a mother and now as a prospective grandmother. And Martin, our next-door neighbor, has performed his magic show, which was really excellent! Apart from the bit when he tried to cut Janice in half and she freaked out when he turned on the chain saw and started crying \u201cDon\u2019t kill me, Martin!\u201d while he kept revving it up like some horror film maniac.</p><p>It was all right in the end. Martin took off his mask and Janice was fine after she had some brandy.</p> <p>And now the band is playing and we\u2019re all on the dance floor. Mum and Dad are grooving away, all rosy-cheeked and beaming at each other, the lights sparkling on Mum\u2019s sequins. Suze is dancing with one arm round Tarquin\u2019s neck and the other round Clementine, who woke up and wouldn\u2019t go back to sleep. Tom and Jess are standing at the edge of the dance floor, talking and occasionally doing a kind of awkward shuffle together. Tom looks pretty good in black tie, I noticed \u2014 and Jess\u2019s black embroidered skirt is fantastic! (I was totally sure it was Dries van Noten. But apparently it was made by a women\u2019s collective in Guatemala and cost about 30p. Typical.)</p><p>And I\u2019m wearing my new pink dress with the handkerchief hem, and dancing (as best I can, given the bump) with Luke. Mum and Dad dance by and wave at us, and I smile back, trying not to cringe in horror. I know this is their party and everything. But my parents really don\u2019t know how to dance. Mum\u2019s wiggling her hips, completely out of time, and Dad\u2019s kind of punching the air like he\u2019s fighting three invisible men at once.</p><p>Why can\u2019t parents dance? Is it some universal law of physics or something?</p><p>Suddenly a terrifying thought hits me. We\u2019re going to be parents! In twenty years\u2019 time, our child will be cringing at us.</p><p>No. I can\u2019t let it happen.</p> <p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I say urgently over the music. \u201cWe have to be able to do cool dancing so we don\u2019t embarrass our child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a very cool dancer,\u201d replies Luke. \u201cVery cool indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had dance lessons in my teens, you know,\u201d he retorts. \u201cI can waltz like Fred Astaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaltz?\u201d I echo derisively. \u201cThat\u2019s not cool! We need to know all the street moves. Watch me.\u201d</p><p>I do a couple of funky head-wriggle body-pop maneuvers, like they do on rap videos. When I look up, Luke is gaping at me.</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hip-hop!\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s street!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky! Love!\u201d Mum has pushed her way through her dancing guests to reach me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Has labor started?\u201d</p><p>Honestly. My family has no idea about contemporary urban street dance trends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I say. \u201cJust dancing.\u201d</p><p>Ow. Actually, I may have pulled a muscle or three.</p><p>\u201cCome here, J-Lo.\u201d Luke puts his arms round me. Mum dances off to talk to Janice and I look up at Luke\u2019s glowing face. He\u2019s been in a good mood ever since that business call he took during coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your call about?\u201d I ask. \u201cGood news?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just had the go-ahead in Barcelona.\u201d His nose twitches, like it always does when he\u2019s delighted with life but wants to look deadpan. \u201cThat takes us up to eight offices, Europe-wide. All down to the Arcodas contract.\u201d</p><p>He never told me Barcelona was on the cards! That\u2019s so Luke, keeping it quiet until the deal\u2019s done. If it hadn\u2019t come off, he probably never would have said a word about it.</p><p>Eight offices. And London and New York. That\u2019s pretty stupendous.</p><p>The music changes to a slow track and Luke pulls me closer. Out of the corner of my eye I notice Jess and Tom have sidled farther onto the dance floor together. Go on, I will Tom silently. Kiss her.</p><p>\u201cSo, things are going pretty well?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThings, my darling, could not be going more fantastically.\u201d Luke meets my eyes, the teasing gone. \u201cSeriously. We\u2019re going to treble our size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I digest this for a few moments. \u201cAre we going to be squillionaires? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCould be.\u201d He nods.</p><p>This is so cool.

Maybe not that last one.</p><p>At last Luke reappears at the study door. The phone\u2019s gone and he\u2019s putting on his suit jacket.</p><p>\u201cListen, Becky...\u201d he begins.</p><p>I knew it. He\u2019s not coming.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never wanted to see Venetia Carter, have you?\u201d My words tumble out. \u201c You\u2019re prejudiced against her! Well, fine! You go and do your business things and I\u2019ll go on my own!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky...\u201d He lifts a hand. \u201cI\u2019m coming to the appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, mollified. \u201cWell, we\u2019d better go. It\u2019s twenty minutes\u2019 walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going by car.\u201d He heads back into the office and I follow him in. \u201cIain\u2019s on his way down from the hotel group meeting. He can pick us up, we\u2019ll have a very quick meeting in the car, then I\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cThat sounds OK.\u201d</p><p>Actually, it sounds awful. I can\u2019t stand Iain Wheeler; the last thing I want to do is sit in a car with him. But I can\u2019t say that to Luke. There\u2019s already a slight situation over me and Arcodas.</p><p>Which was not my fault. It was Jess\u2019s. A few months ago, she got me into leading this big environmental protest against them, when I had no idea they were Luke\u2019s new, important client. Luke turned the whole thing round into a positive PR exercise and the Arcodas people pretended they had a sense of humor about it \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever really been forgiven.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not prejudiced,\u201d Luke adds, straightening his tie. \u201cBut I\u2019ll just tell you now, Becky. This obstetrician woman will have to be pretty damn good for us to cancel Dr. Braine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuke, you\u2019re going to love her,\u201d I say patiently. \u201cI know you are.\u201d</p><p>I reach into my bag to check that my phone\u2019s charged, then halt as I spot something on Luke\u2019s desk. It\u2019s a clipping from the financial pages about some new unit trust, with \u201cBaby fund?\u201d scribbled in the margin.</p><p>Ooh!</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re thinking of putting the baby\u2019s money in a tracker fund, are you, Luke?\u201d I say carelessly. \u201cInteresting decision.\u201d</p> <p>Luke looks taken aback for a moment, then follows my gaze.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am,\u201d he says in equally nonchalant tones. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s a double-bluff to fool the spying opposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe opposition doesn\u2019t need to spy.\u201d I give him a kind smile. \u201cShe has her own brilliant ideas.

Your own investment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliantly, thanks. Couldn\u2019t be better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent. Glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...that recent Japanese farming investment I made was fantastic....\u201d I clap a hand over my mouth. \u201cOops! Said too much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, Becky. You really fool me.\u201d Luke grins. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>We emerge from the building and Luke ushers me into Iain\u2019s black Mercedes limo.</p><p>\u201cLuke.\u201d Iain nods from his seat by the window. \u201cRebecca.\u201d</p><p>Iain is a thickset guy in his early forties, with close-cropped salt-and-pepper hair. He\u2019s quite good-looking, actually, but has terrible skin which he covers up by having a Permatan. And he wears too much aftershave. Why do men do that?</p> <p>\u201cThanks for the lift, Iain,\u201d I say in my best charming-corporate-wife manner.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Iain\u2019s gaze drops to my swelling stomach. \u201cBeen eating too many pies, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>Ha-ha.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d I say, as pleasantly as I can.</p><p>As the car pulls away, Iain takes a slurp of his take-out coffee. \u201cHow long to go before the big day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how do you fill the time until then? Don\u2019t tell me \u2014 yoga classes. My girlfriend\u2019s become a yoga nut,\u201d he adds to Luke, without giving me a chance to answer. \u201cLoad of bollocks if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>Honestly. Number one, yoga is not bollocks, it\u2019s a way to channel your spirit through the chakras of life, or whatever it is.</p> <p>And number two, I don\u2019t need ways to fill my time, thank you.</p><p>\u201cActually, Iain, I\u2019m head personal shopper at a top London department store,\u201d I inform him. \u201cSo I don\u2019t have too much time for yoga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA department store?\u201d He swivels in his seat to regard me. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. Which one?\u201d</p><p>I really fell into this one.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...new,\u201d I say, examining my nails.</p><p>\u201cCalled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called...The Look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Look?\u201d Iain guffaws in disbelief and nearly drops his coffee. \u201cLuke, you didn\u2019t tell me your wife worked for The Look! Business slow enough for you, is it, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d I say politely.</p><p>\u201cNot that bad? There\u2019s never been a bigger retail flop in history! I hope you\u2019ve got rid of your stock options!\u201d He guffaws again. \u201cNot counting on a Christmas bonus, are you?\u201d</p><p>This guy is really starting to annoy me. It\u2019s one thing for me to be rude about The Look; they\u2019re my employer. But it\u2019s quite another matter for other people to be rude.</p><p>\u201cActually, I think The Look is poised for a turnaround,\u201d I say coolly. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a shaky start, I\u2019ll grant you, but all the basics are there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck.\u201d Iain\u2019s face is creased with amusement. \u201cWord of advice? I\u2019d be looking for another job.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile, then turn to look out the window, seething. God, he\u2019s patronizing. I\u2019ll show him. The Look could be a success. It just needs...well. It needs customers, for a start.</p><p>The car draws up to the sidewalk and the uniformed driver gets out to open the door.</p><p>\u201cThanks again for the lift, Iain,\u201d I say politely. \u201cLuke, I\u2019ll see you in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Luke nods, frowning as he clicks open his briefcase. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be too long. So, Iain, what exactly was the problem with this outline?\u201d</p><p>As the driver hands me out to the sidewalk, both men are already engrossed in paperwork.</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right from here?\u201d The driver gestures at the corner. \u201cFencastle Street\u2019s just round there, only I can\u2019t get right to it because of the bollards.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine walking from here. Oh, except I\u2019ve forgotten my bag....\u201d I reach back into the car, where Iain is talking.</p><p>\u201cWhen I want that kind of decision taken, Luke, I\u2019ll fucking take it.\u201d His harsh tone takes me by surprise and I see Luke flinch.</p><p>It\u2019s just unbelievable. Just who does this guy think he is? Just because he\u2019s some business bigwig he thinks he can be rude to anyone he likes? I want to get straight back into the car and tell him exactly what I think of him.</p><p>But I\u2019m not sure Luke would appreciate it.</p> <p>\u201cSee you soon, darling.\u201d I squeeze his hand and pick up my bag. \u201cDon\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a bit early for the appointment, so I take the opportunity to reapply my lipstick and give my hair a quick comb. Then I head to the corner and turn into Fencastle Street. There\u2019s a big impressive stucco building about twenty yards ahead, with Holistic Birth Center, Venetia Carter engraved on the glass. And on the opposite side of the street is a cluster of photographers, their lenses trained on the door.</p><p>I stop dead, my heart beating faster. It\u2019s paparazzi. They\u2019re all clicking away! Who are they \u2014 What are they\u2014</p><p>Oh my God. It\u2019s the new Bond girl! She\u2019s walking toward the building in a pink Juicy strapless top over jeans, with a definite bump showing. I can hear the cries from the photographers: \u201cThis way, love!\u201d and \u201cWhen\u2019s the baby due?\u201d</p><p>This is so cool!</p> <p>Trying to look nonchalant, I hurry along the pavement and arrive at the door at the same time as her. The cameras are all still clicking away behind us. I\u2019ll be in all the gossip magazines with a Bond girl!</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I murmur casually as she presses the buzzer. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Becky. I\u2019m pregnant, too. I like your top!\u201d</p><p>She looks at me as if I\u2019m a moron, then without replying pushes the door open.</p><p>Well. She wasn\u2019t very friendly. But never mind, I\u2019m sure the others will be. I follow her through an elegant tiled hallway and then into a large room with lilac velvet seats and a reception desk, and a huge Jo Malone candle burning on the central table.</p><p>As I head to the desk behind the Bond girl, I do a quick sweep of the room. Two girls in jeans who might easily be supermodels are reading OK! and pointing out pictures to each other. There\u2019s a heavily pregnant girl in Missoni sitting opposite in floods of tears, with a husband who\u2019s holding her hand and saying anxiously, \u201cSweetheart, we can call the baby Aspen if you like, I just didn\u2019t realize you were serious!\u201d</p><p>Aspen.</p> <p>Aspen Brandon.</p><p>Lord Aspen Brandon, Earl of London.</p><p>Hmm. Not sure.</p><p>The Bond girl finishes talking to the receptionist, then moves away and sits down in a corner.</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d The receptionist is looking at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d I beam. \u201cI\u2019m here to see Venetia Carter. Mrs. Rebecca Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a seat, Mrs. Brandon. Dr. Carter will see you presently.\u201d The receptionist smiles and hands me a brochure. \u201cSome introductory literature. Help yourself to herbal tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I take the brochure and sit down opposite the supermodels. Gentle panpipe music is playing over the speakers, and there are photographs of mothers and new babies pinned up on the satin-covered pinboards. The whole atmosphere is serene and beautiful. It\u2019s a million miles away from Dr. Braine\u2019s boring old waiting room, with its plastic chairs and horrible carpet and posters about folic acid.</p> <p>Luke will be so impressed when he arrives. I knew this was the right decision! Happily I start flicking through the brochure, taking in headings here and there. Water Birth...Reflexology Birth...Hypno Birth...</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll have a hypno birth. Whatever that is.</p><p>I\u2019m just lingering over a picture of a girl holding a baby in what looks like a giant Jacuzzi when the receptionist summons me.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brandon? Dr. Carter will see you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I put down the brochure and glance at my watch anxiously. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my husband isn\u2019t here yet. He should only be a few minutes....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d She smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll send him in when he arrives. Please, come this way.\u201d</p><p>I follow the receptionist down the carpeted passage. The walls are covered with signed pictures of glamorous celebrity mothers sitting up in bed with newborn babies, and my head swivels as I walk. I really need to think about what I\u2019m going to wear for the birth. Maybe I\u2019ll ask Venetia Carter for some tips.</p><p>We reach a cream-painted door and the receptionist knocks twice before opening it and ushering me in. \u201cVenetia, this is Mrs. Brandon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMrs. Brandon!\u201d A stunningly beautiful woman with long, vivid red hair comes forward, her hand outstretched. \u201cWelcome to the Holistic Birth Center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I beam at her. \u201cCall me Becky.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Venetia Carter looks like a movie star! She\u2019s far younger than I expected, and slighter. She\u2019s wearing a fitted Armani trouser suit and a crisp white shirt and her hair is drawn off her face with a chic tortoiseshell band.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to meet you, Becky.\u201d Her voice is all silvery and melodious, like the Good Witch of the North. \u201cSit down, and we can have a nice talk.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s wearing vintage Chanel pumps, I notice as I sit down. And look at that gorgeous yellow topaz strung round her neck on a silver wire.</p><p>\u201cI want to thank you for fitting me in at such a late stage,\u201d I say in a rush as I hand over my medical file. \u201cI really appreciate it. And I love your shoes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d She smiles. \u201cSo, let\u2019s have a look. You\u2019re twenty-three weeks pregnant...first baby...\u201d Her manicured finger is running down Dr. Braine\u2019s notes. \u201cAny problems with your pregnancy? Is there a reason you\u2019ve left your previous medical care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted a more holistic approach,\u201d I say, leaning forward earnestly. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading your brochure and I think all your treatments sound amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreatments?\u201d Her pale brow wrinkles.</p> <p>\u201cBirths, I mean,\u201d I amend quickly.</p><p>\u201cWell, now.\u201d Venetia Carter takes a cream file from a drawer, picks up a silver fountain pen, and writes Rebecca Brandon on the front in a flowing italic script. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time to decide which approach to the birth you want. But first, let me find out more about you. You\u2019re married, I understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd is your husband coming today? Mr. Brandon, would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be here.\u201d I click my tongue apologetically. \u201cHe\u2019s just having a quick business meeting outside in the car. But he\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d She lifts her head and smiles, her teeth all perfect and shiny white. \u201cI\u2019m sure your husband\u2019s very excited about having a baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, he is!\u201d I\u2019m just about to tell her all about having our first scan, when the door opens.</p><p>\u201cMr. Brandon is here,\u201d says the receptionist, and Luke strides in, saying, \u201cSorry, sorry, I know I\u2019m late\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Luke!\u201d I say. \u201cCome and meet Dr. Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d She laughs again. \u201cCall me Venetia \u2014 everyone does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenetia?\u201d Luke has stopped dead and is staring at Venetia Carter as though he can\u2019t believe his eyes. \u201cVenetia? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>Venetia Carter\u2019s mouth drops open.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d she says. \u201cLuke Brandon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you two know each other?\u201d I say in astonishment.</p> <p>For an instant, neither speaks.</p><p>\u201cWe were at Cambridge,\u201d Luke says at last. \u201cYears ago. But...\u201d He rubs his forehead. \u201cVenetia Carter. Did you get married or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my surname by deed poll,\u201d Venetia says with a rueful smile. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your name before you changed it?\u201d I ask politely, but neither of them seems to hear me.</p><p>\u201cHow many years is it?\u201d Luke still looks thunderstruck.</p><p>\u201cToo long. Far too long.\u201d She runs a hand through her hair and it falls back into place in a perfect red waterfall. \u201cDo you still see any of the old Browns gang? Like Jonathan? Or Matthew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost touch.\u201d Luke shrugs. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept up with very few of them while I was in the States. But now that I\u2019m back in London, some of us meet up whenever we can.\u201d She\u2019s interrupted by a bleeping sound from her pocket. She reaches for a pager and switches it off. \u201cExcuse me, I just need to make a call. I\u2019ll pop next door.\u201d</p><p>As she disappears I look at Luke. His face is all lit up as though it\u2019s Christmas Day.</p><p>\u201cYou know Venetia?\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d He shakes his head incredulously. \u201cShe was part of a crowd I used to know at Cambridge. Of course, she was Venetia Grime back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrime?\u201d I can\u2019t help a giggle.</p><p>\u201cHardly the best name for a doctor.\u201d He grins back. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised she changed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you know her well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were at the same college.\u201d Luke nods. \u201cShe was always incredibly bright, Venetia. Incredibly talented. I always knew she\u2019d do well in life.\u201d He breaks off as the door opens and Venetia returns. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that!\u201d She comes round and sits on the front of her desk, one long Armani-clad leg crossed casually over the other. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just saying to Luke what a coincidence it was!\u201d I say. \u201cYou and he already knowing each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it extraordinary?\u201d She gives her silvery laugh. \u201cOut of all the hundreds of patients I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve never before had one married to an ex-boyfriend!\u201d</p><p>My smile freezes slightly on my face.</p> <p>Ex-boyfriend?</p><p>\u201cI was just trying to remember how long we dated for, Luke,\u201d she adds. \u201cWas it a year?\u201d</p><p>They dated for a year?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d says Luke easily. \u201cLong time ago.\u201d</p><p>Hang on.

I\u2019ve never even heard of a Venetia before.</p><p>I mean...not that it matters or anything. Why would it matter? I\u2019m not the kind of person who gets hung up on old girlfriends from the past.

A water birth, you were saying?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re in there for another twenty-five minutes, talking about vitamins and blood tests and a load of other stuff. But to be truthful, my mind\u2019s not really on the job.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to concentrate, but all these distracting images keep coming into my head. Like Luke and Venetia all dressed up in Cambridge student gear, kissing passionately on a punt. (Do I mean a punt? Or a gondola? The boat thing with a pole, anyway.)</p><p>And then I keep picturing him running his hands through her long red hair. And murmuring, \u201cVenetia, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Which is just stupid. I bet he never told her he loved her.</p><p>I bet...a thousand quid.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I come to and suddenly realize the appointment is over. Both Luke and Venetia are standing up, waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ll do a birth plan for me, Becky?\u201d Venetia says as she opens the door.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing too complicated!\u201d She smiles. \u201cI\u2019d just like to get a general picture of how you envisage the birth. And Luke, I\u2019ll give you a call. I know some of the old crowd would love to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d His face is animated as he kisses her on each cheek. Then the door closes and we\u2019re walking back down the corridor.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what Luke\u2019s thinking.</p><p>I\u2019m not entirely sure what I\u2019m thinking, to be honest.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Luke says at last. \u201cVery impressive. Very, very impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Luke suddenly stops dead. \u201cI want to apologize. You were right and I was wrong.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was so negative about coming here. You\u2019re right: I was prejudiced and stupid. But you\u2019ve completely made the right decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod several times. \u201cSo...so you think we should go with Venetia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d He laughs, puzzled. \u201cDon\u2019t you?

Jasmine, who works with me, is slumped on the sofa. Our appointment book is empty, the phone is silent, and as I look around, the place is as dead as ever. Not a single customer. The only sign of movement out on the shop floor is Len the security guard doing his usual rounds, and he looks as fed up as the rest of us feel.</p><p>When I think what it used to be like at Barneys in New York, all bright and full of chatter and people buying thousand-dollar dresses...And all I\u2019ve sold this week is a pair of fishnets and an out-of-season raincoat. This place is a disaster. And we opened only ten weeks ago.</p><p>The Look is backed by this big tycoon, Giorgio Laszlo. It was supposed to be a buzzy, high-concept department store which would take over from Selfridges and Harvey Nichols. But things started going wrong from day one; in fact, the place is a national joke.</p><p>First of all, a whole warehouse of stock got burned down and the launch had to be delayed. Then a light fixture fell from the ceiling and concussed one of the beauty assistants, right in the middle of a makeup demonstration. Then there was a suspected outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease and we were all sent home for five days. It turned out to be false \u2014 but the damage was done. All the papers ran stories on how The Look was cursed, and printed cartoons showing the customers keeling over and having bits of the building fall on them. (Which were actually quite funny, but we\u2019re not allowed to say that.)</p><p>And no one\u2019s come back since we reopened. Everyone seems to think the place is still closed, or infectious, or something. The Daily World, who are total enemies of Giorgio Laszlo, keep sending undercover photographers to take pictures of the shop floors and run them under headings like \u201cStill Empty!\u201d and \u201cHow Much Longer Can This Folly Last?\u201d The rumor is that if things don\u2019t pick up soon, the place will fold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a gloomy sigh, Jasmine turns a page and starts reading the horoscopes. That\u2019s the other problem: it\u2019s hard to keep your staff motivated when business is down. (Jasmine is my staff.) Before I started this job I read one of Luke\u2019s management books to get some tips on how to be a boss, and it said it was \u201ccrucial to keep giving your team compliments in bad times.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve already complimented Jasmine\u2019s hair, shoes, and bag. To be honest, there\u2019s not a lot left.</p><p>\u201cI like your...eyebrows, Jasmine!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cWhere do you get them done?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine looks at me as though I\u2019ve asked her to eat baby whale. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my secret. If I tell you, you\u2019ll go there too and then you\u2019ll have my look.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine is skinny, with trails of bleached-blond hair, a nose stud, and one blue eye and one green eye. She could not look less like me if she tried.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have your look!\u201d I retort lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll just have good eyebrows! Go on, tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p> <p>I feel a surge of frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhen you asked me where I have my hair done, I told you,\u201d I remind her. \u201cI gave you a card and recommended the best stylist and got you ten percent off your first haircut. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is eyebrows! It\u2019s less important!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think.\u201d</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about to tell her that I don\u2019t care where she gets her stupid eyebrows done (which is a lie, as I\u2019ve now become obsessed with them), when I hear footsteps. Striding, heavy, senior-management kind of footsteps.</p> <p>Quickly Jasmine shoves her Heat magazine under a pile of sweaters and I pretend to be adjusting a scarf on a mannequin. A moment later, Eric Wilmot, the marketing director, appears round the corner with a couple of smartly suited guys I\u2019ve never seen before.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is the personal shopping department,\u201d he says to the men with a fake-jovial air. \u201cRebecca here used to work at Barneys in New York! Rebecca, meet Clive and Andrew from First Results Consulting. Here to throw a few ideas around.\u201d He gives a strained smile.</p><p>Eric was only promoted to marketing director last week, when the previous one resigned. He really doesn\u2019t look like a man who\u2019s relishing his new job.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any customers for days,\u201d says Jasmine flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s like a morgue in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Eric\u2019s smile tightens.</p><p>\u201cAn empty morgue without any dead people,\u201d she clarifies. \u201cIt\u2019s deader than a morgue. \u2019Cause at least in a morgue\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all aware of the situation, thank you, Jasmine.\u201d Eric cuts her off briskly. \u201cWhat we need is solutions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we get people in through the doors?\u201d One of the consultants is addressing a mannequin. \u201cThat\u2019s the question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do we maintain their loyalty?\u201d chimes in the other one thoughtfully.</p><p>For goodness\u2019 sake. I reckon I could be a consultant if all you do is wear a suit and ask totally obvious questions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the unique selling point?\u201d the first chimes in again.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t one,\u201d I say, unable to keep my mouth shut any longer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the same old stock as everyone else. Oh, and by the way, you might get ill or injured if you shop here. We need an edge!\u201d</p><p>The three men all stare at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThe public perception of danger is obviously our greatest challenge,\u201d says the first consultant, frowning. \u201cWe need to counter the negative coverage, create a positive, healthy image\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s totally missing my point.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter!\u201d I cut him off. \u201cIf we had something unique, that people really wanted, they\u2019d come in anyway. Like, when I lived in New York I once went to a sample sale in a condemned building. There were all these warnings outside saying Do Not Enter, Unsafe, but I\u2019d heard they had Jimmy Choos at eighty percent off. So I went in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they?\u201d says Jasmine, perking up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say regretfully. \u201cThey\u2019d all gone. But I found a fab Gucci trench coat, only seventy dollars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went into a condemned building?\u201d Eric is goggling at me. \u201cFor a pair of shoes?\u201d</p><p>Something tells me he isn\u2019t going to last in this job.</p><p>\u201cOf course! And there were about a hundred other girls there too. And if we had something fab and exclusive at The Look, they\u2019d come here like a shot! Even if the roof was falling in! Like some really hot designer diffusion range.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This idea has been brewing in my mind for a while now. I even tried talking to Brianna, the chief buyer, about it last week. But she just nodded and asked if I could bring her the Dolce diamante dress in a size 2 because she was going to a premiere that night and the red Versace was too tight around the butt, and what did I think?</p><p>God knows how Brianna got her job. Well, actually, everybody knows. It\u2019s because she\u2019s Giorgio Laszlo\u2019s wife and used to be a model. In the press release when The Look opened it said this would qualify her perfectly to be chief buyer, as she has the \u201cknowledge and savvy of a fashion insider.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t add \u201cunfortunately she has not one brain cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiffusion...designer...\u201d The first consultant is scribbling in his little book. \u201cWe should speak to Brianna about that.

We\u2019ll progress that idea.\u201d The consultant snaps the book shut. \u201cLet\u2019s move on.\u201d</p><p>They all stride off again, and I wait till they\u2019ve rounded the corner before giving a harrumph of frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d says Jasmine, who has slumped back down on the sofa and is texting something on her phone.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never get anything off the ground! Brianna won\u2019t be back for weeks, and anyway, she\u2019s hopeless. They\u2019ll just have meetings and talk...and meanwhile the shop will go bust.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d Jasmine gives an indifferent shrug.</p><p>How can she just watch a business collapse and not try to do something?</p><p>\u201cI care because...because this is where I work! It could be a success!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet real, Becky. No designer\u2019s ever going to want to do an exclusive range here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrianna could call in some favors,\u201d I protest. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s modeled for Calvin Klein, Versace...Tom Ford.... She could persuade one of them, surely? God, if I had a famous designer friend\u2014\u201d I stop, midflow.</p><p>Hang on. Why didn\u2019t I think of this before?</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jasmine looks up.</p><p>\u201cI do know a designer,\u201d I say. \u201cI know Danny Kovitz! We could get him to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Danny Kovitz?\u201d Jasmine looks skeptical. \u201cOr, like, you\u2019ve bumped into him once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really know him! He used to live above me in New York. He designed my wedding dress,\u201d I can\u2019t help adding smugly.</p><p>It\u2019s so cool, having a famous friend. I knew Danny when he was a nobody. In fact I helped get him his first break. And now he\u2019s this international fashion darling! He\u2019s been in Vogue and had his dresses worn to the Oscars and everything. He was interviewed in Women\u2019s Wear Daily last month about his last collection, which he said was based on his interpretation of the decay of civilization.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe a word of it. It\u2019ll have been something he threw together at the last minute with lots of safety pins and black coffee and someone else sewed up for him.</p><p>But still. An exclusive Danny Kovitz line would be fabulous publicity. I should have thought of this before.</p><p>\u201cIf you really know Danny Kovitz, ring him up,\u201d says Jasmine challengingly. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t believe me?</p><p>\u201cFine, I will!\u201d I whip out my phone, find the number for Danny\u2019s mobile, and dial it.</p><p>The truth is, I haven\u2019t spoken to Danny for quite a long while. But still, we went through a lot together while I was living in New York, and we\u2019ll always have that bond. I wait for a while, but there\u2019s no reply, just a bleeping sound. He probably lost his phone and canceled it or something.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Jasmine raises one immaculate eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHis cell phone isn\u2019t working,\u201d I say coolly. \u201cI\u2019ll call his office.\u201d I dial international directories, get a New York number for Danny Kovitz Enterprises, and dial. It\u2019s nine thirty A.M. in New York, which means there\u2019s not much chance of Danny being up, unless he\u2019s had an all-nighter. But I can leave a message.</p><p>A male voice answers. \u201cDanny Kovitz Enterprises. May I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi there!\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s Becky Brandon here, n\u00e9e Bloomwood.

Becky Bloomwood? Do you remember me?\u201d</p><p>I always liked Danny\u2019s mum. We have a good old chat, and she asks all about the baby and I ask all about her award-winning gardens in Connecticut, and the conversation ends with her expressing sympathetic indignation at the way I was treated by Danny\u2019s staff, especially after I was the one who first introduced his work to Barneys (I reminded her about that, just casually), and promising to get Danny to call me.</p> <p>And literally about two minutes after we\u2019ve finished talking, my cell phone rings.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky! Mom says you called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny!\u201d I can\u2019t help shooting a triumphant glance at Jasmine. \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s been ages. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great! Except my mom just gave me a total rocket. Jesus!\u201d Danny sounds a bit shaken. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Don\u2019t you stop appreciating your friends, young man.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018What are you talking about? \u2019And she\u2019s like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour assistants wouldn\u2019t put me through,\u201d I explain. \u201cThey thought I was a fan. Or a stalker or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do get stalkers.\u201d Danny sounds quite proud of himself. \u201cI have two at the moment, both named Joshua. Isn\u2019t that wild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I can\u2019t help feeling impressed, even though I know I shouldn\u2019t be. \u201cSo...what are you up to at the moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking some time to work on my new collection,\u201d he says with a practiced smoothness. \u201cI\u2019m reinterpreting the whole Far Eastern vibe. Right now I\u2019m at the concept stage. Gathering influences, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t fool me. \u201cGathering influences\u201d means \u201cGoing on holiday and getting stoned on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was just wondering,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cCould you do me a massive favor? Could you do a little diffusion line for this shop I work for in London? Or even just one exclusive piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, and I can hear him opening a can. \u201cSure. When?\u201d</p><p>Ha! I knew he\u2019d say yes.</p><p>\u201cWell...soon?\u201d I cross my fingers. \u201cIn the next few weeks? You could come to London for a visit. We\u2019d have a blast!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I don\u2019t know....\u201d He pauses to slurp at his drink, and I imagine him in some trendy SoHo office, lounging on an office chair, in those ancient jeans he always used to wear. \u201cI have this Far East trip lined up....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI saw Jude Law in the street the other day,\u201d I add casually. \u201cHe lives quite close to us.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cOr I guess I could swing by,\u201d Danny says at last. \u201cLondon\u2019s on the way to Thailand, right?\u201d</p><p>Yes! I have total R.E.S.P.E.C.T.</p> <p>For the rest of the day Jasmine barely says a word, just keeps shooting me awed looks.

And on the plus side, the fact that we don\u2019t have anything to do has given me time to read my new issue of Pregnancy magazine.</p><p>\u201cHey, your phone\u2019s ringing in your bag,\u201d says Jasmine as she comes from the reception area. \u201cIt\u2019s been ringing all day, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for telling me!\u201d I say sarcastically. I hurry to my desk, grab the phone, and click it on.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d comes Mum\u2019s excited voice. \u201cAt last! So, darling. How was the famous celebrity obstetrician? We\u2019re all longing to know! Janice has been in and out all day!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh right. Let me just...\u201d I close the door and sit down on my desk chair, marshaling my thoughts. \u201cWell...it was amazing! Guess what, I met a Bond girl in the waiting room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Bond girl!\u201d Mum draws in breath. \u201cJanice, did you hear that? Becky met a Bond girl in the waiting room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the place is lovely, and I\u2019m going to have a holistic water birth, and they gave me this lovely welcome pack all full of spa vouchers....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful!\u201d says Mum. \u201cAnd she\u2019s a nice lady, is she? The doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice.\u201d I pause for a moment, then add casually, \u201cShe\u2019s Luke\u2019s ex-girlfriend. Isn\u2019t that a coincidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-girlfriend?\u201d Mum\u2019s voice sharpens a little. \u201cWhat do you mean, ex-girlfriend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know! Just someone he went out with ages ago. At Cambridge.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence down the phone.</p><p>\u201cIs she attractive?\u201d says Mum.</p><p>Honestly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s quite attractive. But I don\u2019t see what that has to do with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, darling.\u201d There\u2019s a scuffly sort of pause, and I\u2019m positive I can hear Mum whispering something to Janice. \u201cDo you know why she and Luke split up?\u201d she suddenly asks.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you asked him about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMum,\u201d I say, trying to keep my patience. \u201cLuke and I have a very secure, trusting marriage. I\u2019m not going to quiz him, OK?\u201d</p><p>What does she think I should do, issue Luke a questionnaire? I mean, I know Dad turned out to have had a slightly more colorful past than anyone might have suspected (affair with train stewardess; secret love child; handlebar mustache). But Luke\u2019s not like that \u2014 I know he\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cAnd anyway, it was all ages ago,\u201d I add, sounding more defiant than I mean to. \u201cAnd she\u2019s got a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Becky love.\u201d Mum exhales sharply. \u201cAre you sure this is a good idea? Pregnancy can be a...tricky time for a man. What about going back to that nice gentleman doctor?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m starting to feel a bit insulted here. What does Mum think, that I can\u2019t hold on to my husband?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re with Venetia Carter now,\u201d I say obstinately. \u201cIt\u2019s all signed and sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well, darling. If you\u2019re sure. What\u2019s that, Janice?\u201d There\u2019s another scuffling at the other end. \u201cJanice says, was it Halle Berry you met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was the new one. The blond Rollerblade champion. Mum, I\u2019d better go. I\u2019ve got a call waiting. Give my love to everyone. Bye!\u201d I switch off the phone, and a second later it rings again.</p><p>\u201cBex! I\u2019ve been trying you all day! How was it?\u201d Suze\u2019s excited voice peals down the line. \u201cTell me everything. Are you having the Thai water birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe!\u201d I can\u2019t help beaming. \u201cOh, Suze, it was fab! You get massage, and reflexology, and I met a Bond girl, and there were paparazzi waiting outside and we got photographed together! We\u2019ll be in Hello!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d Suze\u2019s voice rises to a squeak. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so jealous. I want another baby now, and have it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t actually have it at the center,\u201d I explain. \u201cYou have all the appointments there, but she\u2019s linked to the Cavendish Hospital.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Cavendish?

Isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s...what?\u201d Suze sounds like she can\u2019t believe her ears.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Luke\u2019s ex. They went out at Cambridge together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having your baby delivered by Luke\u2019s ex-girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>First Mum, then Suze. What\u2019s wrong with everyone?</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cWhy not? It was years ago and it only lasted about five minutes. And she\u2019s attached to someone else now. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt just seems a bit...weird, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not weird! Suze, we\u2019re all grown-ups. We\u2019re all mature, professional people. I think we can get past some old, meaningless fling, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I mean, she\u2019ll be...you know! Poking about.\u201d</p><p>This thought had crossed my mind. But then, is it any worse than Dr. Braine poking about? To be honest, I\u2019m in denial about this whole birth business happening at all. I\u2019m half hoping they\u2019ll invent some new labor-substitute device by the time I reach my due date.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be paranoid!\u201d Suze is saying. \u201cI once met this ex of Tarkie\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarquin has an ex?\u201d I say in astonishment, before I realize how this sounds.</p> <p>\u201cFlissy Menkin. Of the Somerset Menkins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I say, as though I have a clue what the Somerset Menkins might be. They sound like china pots. Or some kind of galloping disease.</p><p>\u201cI knew she was going to be at this wedding last year, and I practically spent the whole week getting ready. And that was with clothes on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll get a really good bikini wax,\u201d I say airily. \u201cAnd maybe I\u2019ll have a cesarean. And the point is, she\u2019s the top baby-deliverer in the country! She should be used to it by now, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI s\u2019pose.\u201d Suze still sounds doubtful. \u201cBut still. Bex, if I were you, I\u2019d steer clear. Go back to your other doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to steer clear.\u201d I feel like stamping my foot. \u201cAnd I totally trust Luke,\u201d I add as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d says Suze hastily. \u201cOf course you do. So...did he chuck her, or the other way around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admit.</p> <p>\u201cHasn\u2019t he told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t asked him! It\u2019s irrelevant!\u201d Suze is starting to rattle me with all her questions. \u201cGuess what? I got Cr\u00e8me de la Mer in the welcome pack,\u201d I say to distract her. \u201cAnd a voucher for Champneys!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d Suze perks up. \u201cCan you take a guest?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to let Suze and Mum freak me out. They don\u2019t know anything about it! Luke and I have a totally stable, trusting relationship. We\u2019re having a baby together. I feel totally secure.</p><p>On the way home that night I pop into Hollis Franklin quickly, just to look at baby linen. Hollis Franklin is such a gorgeous shop, it\u2019s got a Royal Warrant and apparently the Queen herself shops there! I spend a happy hour looking at different thread counts, and by the time I arrive back home, it\u2019s seven. Luke is in the kitchen, drinking a beer and watching the news.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, putting down my bags. \u201cI got the baby some sheets from Hollis Franklin!\u201d I pull out a tiny crib sheet embroidered with a tiny crest in each corner. \u201cIsn\u2019t that adorable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d says Luke, examining it. Then he catches sight of the price tag and blanches. \u201cJesus. You paid that for a baby sheet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the best,\u201d I explain. \u201cThey\u2019re four hundred thread count!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the baby need four hundred thread count? You realize it\u2019ll throw up on these sheets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby would never throw up on a Hollis Franklin sheet!\u201d I say, indignant. \u201cIt knows better than that.\u201d I pat my bump. \u201cDon\u2019t you, darling?\u201d</p><p>Luke rolls his eyes. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d He puts the sheet down. \u201cAnd what\u2019s in the bigger bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatching sheets for us. The duvet cover\u2019s coming separately, and the pillow shams as soon as they\u2019re in stock\u2014\u201d I break off at his appalled expression. \u201cLuke, we\u2019ll have the crib in our bedroom! We have to coordinate!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCoordinate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, really\u2014\u201d Luke\u2019s attention is drawn to the TV screen. \u201cHold on, it\u2019s Malcolm.\u201d He turns up the volume and I take the opportunity to shove the Hollis Franklin sheets behind the door, where Luke might forget about them.</p><p>Malcolm Lloyd is the chief executive of Arcodas, and he\u2019s being interviewed in the business slot about why he\u2019s planning to make a bid for some airline company. Luke watches intently, beer in hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe should stop doing that jerky thing with his hand,\u201d I say, watching the interview too. \u201cHe looks really awkward. He should go on media training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already been on media training,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was rubbish. You should get someone new.\u201d I take off my jacket, dump it on a chair, and massage my aching shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCome here, sweetheart,\u201d says Luke, noticing me. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>I pull a chair over and sit down in front of him, and he starts kneading my tight muscles.</p> <p>\u201cLuke, that reminds me,\u201d I say, still watching Malcolm. \u201cDoes Iain always talk to you like that?\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s fingers stop moving briefly. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way he did in the car yesterday. He\u2019s so unpleasant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just his business style.

Everyone\u2019s just got to\u2014\u201d He stops himself.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I twist my head, trying to see his expression.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d says Luke after a moment. \u201cJust...thinking aloud. Let\u2019s turn this off.\u201d He kisses me on the top of my head. \u201cShoulders feel better now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA million times. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I get up, pour myself a glass of orange-cranberry mix, and flip the TV over to The Simpsons. Meanwhile, Luke picks up the Evening Standard and starts leafing through the pages. A bowl of olives is on the counter, and we pass it back and forth between us.</p><p>There now, isn\u2019t this nice? Just a nice quiet evening at home. Just the two of us, relaxing together in our stable relationship. Not thinking about old girlfriends or anything like that.</p><p>In fact, I\u2019m so relaxed, maybe I will bring the subject up. Just in a casual way. To show I don\u2019t care one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cSo...that must have been weird for you,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cComing across Venetia again after all those years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Luke nods absently.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you and she break up?\u201d I say, still lightly. \u201cJust out of interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows.\u201d Luke shrugs. \u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>You see? It was so long ago, he can\u2019t even remember. It\u2019s ancient history. I really don\u2019t care what the gory details were. In fact, let\u2019s talk about something else. Current affairs or something.</p><p>\u201cDid you love her?\u201d I hear myself saying.</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d Luke gives a short laugh. \u201cWe were students.\u201d</p><p>I wait for him to expand on the subject, but he turns a page of the paper and frowns at a headline.</p><p>That is not an answer. \u201cWe were students\u201d is not an answer.</p><p>I open my mouth to demand \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Then, after a moment\u2019s thought, I close it again. This is ridiculous. I\u2019d never even met Venetia Carter till yesterday \u2014 and already Mum and Suze have made me all paranoid.

They\u2019ll have a lovely day together,\u201d Suze adds fondly. \u201cShe\u2019s going to teach him how to pluck a pheasant.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not just Tarquin. Suze\u2019s entire family really is the weirdest.</p><p>As we enter the fair, I can\u2019t help a tiny gasp. This place is huge. All around are gigantic photographs of babies, and colorful stalls, and promo girls handing out carrier bags. The music from The Lion King is playing out of loudspeakers, and a clown on stilts is juggling foam bananas.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Suze in a businesslike manner as we join the queue. \u201cHave you got a list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cList?\u201d I echo vaguely. I can\u2019t stop looking around at everyone\u2019s prams and changing bags and babies\u2019 outfits. A few people are smiling at the sight of Wilfrid and Clementine, sitting up side by side with their bright blue eyes, and I beam back proudly.</p><p>\u201cYour list of baby gear,\u201d says Suze patiently. \u201cWhat do you still need?\u201d She rifles in the envelope containing the tickets. \u201cHere we are. The New Baby Checklist. Do you have a sterilizer yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...no.\u201d My eyes are fixated on a bright red stroller with a cool polka-dot hood. That would look fab going down the King\u2019s Road.</p><p>\u201cOr a nursing pillow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to use an electric breast pump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrgh.\u201d I recoil slightly. \u201cDo I have to? Ooh, look, they\u2019ve got mini cowboy boots!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex...\u201d Suze waits till I turn. \u201cYou do know having a baby is about more than buying them clothes, don\u2019t you? You do have...realistic expectations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have totally realistic expectations!\u201d I say with slight indignation. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to get everything on that list. I\u2019m going to be the best-prepared mother ever. Come on, let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>As we head down between the stands, my head is swiveling from side to side. I\u2019ve never seen so many gadgets...and baby outfits...and adorable-looking toys....</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need a car seat,\u201d Suze is saying. \u201cSome fix into the car, and some also clip onto wheels....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I nod vaguely. I can\u2019t get that excited by car seats, to be honest.</p><p>\u201cAnd look, here\u2019s a sterilizer and bottle system,\u201d says Suze. She pauses by the Avent stand and picks up a leaflet. \u201cThey have microwave ones...electric ones.... Even if you\u2019re breast-feeding, you\u2019ll need to express....\u201d</p><p>My attention has been caught by a stand named Disco Baby. \u201cHey, Suze!\u201d I interrupt her. \u201cBaby leg warmers!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d She nods. \u201cDo you want a four-bottle sterilizer or a six-bottle sterilizer, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd rattles in the shape of little glitter balls! Suze, look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Suze\u2019s face lights up. \u201cI have to buy those for the twins.\u201d She abandons the Avent leaflets, grabs her double buggy, and pushes it over. There are little \u201cdisco girl\u201d and \u201cdisco boy\u201d sweatshirts, and the cutest little baseball caps.</p><p>\u201cI just wish I knew what I was having,\u201d I say, picking up a tiny pink skirt and stroking it longingly.</p> <p>\u201cDid you try the ancient Chinese chart?\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cYes. It said I was having a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boy!\u201d Suze\u2019s face lights up.</p><p>\u201cBut then I found this Web site called Analyze Your Cravings, and according to that, I\u2019m having a girl.\u201d I sigh in frustration. \u201cI just want to know.\u201d</p><p>Suze looks perplexed, then reaches for a hat. \u201cBuy this. It\u2019s unisex.\u201d</p> <p>I buy the hat and a pair of the most fabulous kitsch platform bootees, and a Groove Baby miniature dressing gown. At the next stall I buy a baby beach towel and mini-sunshade, and a remote-controlled Winnie the Pooh mobile. I\u2019m getting quite laden, to be honest, but Suze just keeps stashing all her stuff in the double buggy. Prams are so handy for shopping. I\u2019d never quite appreciated it before.</p><p>And we\u2019ve got all day here.</p><p>\u201cSuze, I need a pram,\u201d I say, making a snap decision.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She nods vigorously. \u201cThe Pram City stand is just here, behind Zone C. You\u2019ll probably need a whole travel system, and you might want to get a lightweight buggy for traveling....\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m barely listening as I head for the Pram City sign. The entrance is decorated with bunting and balloons, and as I step through, I can see prams stretching into the distance like an endless chrome shrubbery.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say to a man in a green jacket and PRAM CITY badge. \u201cI need a pram straightaway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d He beams at me. \u201cWe normally deliver within four weeks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need one now,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cTo take away. I don\u2019t mind what kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His face falls. \u201cThese are all for display only, I\u2019m afraid....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d I give him my most winsome smile. \u201cYou must have one you can sell me. Just one little pram? Some old one you don\u2019t need anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...right.\u201d He glances nervously at my stomach. \u201cI\u2019ll...see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>He bustles away, and I look around at the trendy prams. Suze is swooning over some state-of-the-art double buggy on a special podium of its own, and to my right, a pregnant woman and her husband are pushing an amazing contraption upholstered in black leather, with built-in drink holders.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d like it.\u201d The woman is glowing with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d The man kisses the back of her neck, cradling her bump. \u201cLet\u2019s order it.\u201d</p> <p>I feel a sudden pang, deep inside. I want to try out prams with Luke. I want to go as a couple, and push prams around and for Luke to kiss me like that.</p><p>I mean, I know it\u2019s a hectic time for him and he\u2019s really busy at work. I know he\u2019s never going to be some New Man who knows every brand of diaper and wears a fake pregnancy stomach. But still, I don\u2019t want to have to do everything on my own.</p><p>And I bet he\u2019d love that black leather one too. It\u2019s probably even got a BlackBerry holder.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bex.\u201d Suze comes over, pushing the twins with one hand and the state-of-the-art buggy with the other. \u201cDo you think I need a new pram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I look at the twins. \u201cIsn\u2019t that double buggy quite new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but, I mean, this one\u2019s really maneuverable. It would be really practical! I think I should get it. I mean, you can\u2019t have too many prams, can you?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a kind of lust in her eyes. Since when did Suze become such a pramaholic?</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe I should get it too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Suze in delight. \u201cThen we\u2019d be matching! Have a go!\u201d She hands it to me and I push it about for a bit. It is pretty cool, I have to say.</p><p>\u201cI love the squidgy handles,\u201d I say, squeezing them.</p><p>\u201cMe too! And the cool wheel design.\u201d</p><p>This is just how we used to be in clothes shops together. God, I never thought I\u2019d get as excited by a pushchair as I do about a dress.</p><p>\u201cMadam?\u201d The assistant is back. \u201cHere we are. I can let you buy this model today. Seventy pounds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s pushing an old-fashioned coach pram in an uninspiring shade of gray, with a pink lacy pillow and quilt. Suze stares at it, aghast.</p><p>\u201cBex, you can\u2019t put the baby in that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for the baby,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s for my shopping!\u201d I plonk all my carrier bags inside and grasp the handles. \u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d</p><p>I pay for it, and prize Suze away from the hi-tech buggy, and we head off to the Refreshment Zone, passing lots of stalls on the way. I buy a paddling pool, and a box of building blocks and a huge teddy and just sling them all on top of the pram. And there\u2019s still room for loads more! Honestly, I should have bought a pram years ago.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the coffees,\u201d says Suze as we near the caf\u00e9 area.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a sec,\u201d I say absently. I\u2019ve spotted a stand with vintage-style hobbyhorses, which are absolutely gorgeous. I\u2019ll buy one for the baby and one each for Suze\u2019s children.</p><p>The only trouble is, there\u2019s a massive queue. I maneuver the pram into line as best I can and lean on the handles with a sigh. I\u2019m quite tired actually, after all this walking. In front of me is an old woman in a dark red raincoat. She turns, then pulls an expression of horror as she sees me leaning on the pram.</p><p>\u201cLet this young lady through!\u201d she exclaims, tapping the woman in front of her. \u201cShe has a baby and she\u2019s expecting! The poor thing\u2019s exhausted \u2014 look at her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I say, taken aback. Everyone is moving aside like I\u2019m royalty, and the raincoat woman is urging me to push the pram forward. \u201cUm...I don\u2019t actually have a...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome through, come through! How old\u2019s your wee one?\u201d The old woman peers into the pram. \u201cI can\u2019t see the poor little thing for all your gubbins!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...well...\u201d</p><p>The stand owner is beckoning me forward encouragingly. Everyone\u2019s waiting for me to go first.</p><p>OK. I know I should be honest. I do know that.</p><p>But the queue\u2019s gigantic, and Suze is waiting...and what does it really matter if there\u2019s a baby in here or not?</p><p>\u201cIs it a boy or a girl?\u201d the old woman persists.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s...a girl!\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cShe\u2019s asleep,\u201d I add hurriedly. \u201cI\u2019d like four hobbyhorses, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the dear little thing,\u201d says the old woman fondly. \u201cAnd her name?\u201d</p><p>Ooh! Names!</p><p>\u201cTallulah,\u201d I say impulsively. \u201cI mean...Phoebe. Tallulah-Phoebe.\u201d I hand the stall owner the money, take the hobbyhorses, and somehow balance them on the pram. \u201cThanks very much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be a good girl, Tallulah-Phoebe,\u201d the old woman is clucking into the pram. \u201cYou be good for your mum and the new arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she will!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cNice to meet you! Thanks very much!\u201d And I hastily wheel the pram away, feeling a giggle rise inside. I turn the corner and immediately spot Suze at the coffee counter, chatting to a girl with highlights and an off-road pushchair and three children in matching stripy tops tied to it with reins.</p><p>\u201cHi, Bex!\u201d she calls. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have a decaf cappuccino and a choc chip muffin?\u201d I call back. \u201cAnd I have to tell you what just happened\u2014\u201d I break off as the girl with highlights turns.</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe it.</p><p>It\u2019s Lulu.</p><p>Lulu, Suze\u2019s horrible friend from the country. My heart sinks like a stone as I wave cheerfully. What\u2019s she doing here? Just as we were having such a good time.</p><p>They\u2019re coming over toward me now, all the toddlers trailing in their wake like kites being dragged along a beach. Lulu is looking as sensible-mummy as ever, in her pink cords and white shirt and pearl earrings, which probably all came out of the same sensible-mummy catalog.</p><p>Oh God, I know that\u2019s really bitchy. But I can\u2019t help it. Lulu has rubbed me the wrong way ever since the first time we met and she totally looked down on me because I didn\u2019t have any kids.(And also maybe because I took my bra off in front of all the children to entertain them. But I was really desperate, OK? And it\u2019s not like they saw anything.)</p><p>\u201cLulu!\u201d I force a smile. \u201cHow are you? I didn\u2019t know you were coming today!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know myself!\u201d Lulu\u2019s voice is so sharp and posh, it makes me wince. \u201cI was offered a sudden promotion opportunity. For my new children\u2019s cookbook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Suze told me about that. Congratulations!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd congratulations to you!\u201d Lulu eyes my bump. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get together sometime!

But now suddenly because I\u2019m having a baby we\u2019re supposed to be friends?</p><p>\u201cThat would be super!\u201d I say pleasantly, and Suze shoots me a look.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a section on pregnancy in my cookbook, actually....\u201d Lulu rifles in her bag for a shiny book, illustrated with a photo of herself holding an armful of vegetables in her kitchen. \u201cI must send you a copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, on cravings and stuff?\u201d I take a sip of decaf. \u201cI could do with some good nonalcoholic cocktail recipes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve called it \u2018Think of the Baby.\u2019\u201d She frowns slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking, what some people put in their bodies while they\u2019re pregnant. Additives...sugar...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I hesitate, chocolate muffin halfway toward my mouth, then defiantly stuff it in. \u201cMmm, yum.\u201d</p><p>I can see Suze hide a giggle.</p><p>\u201cWould your children like some?\u201d I add, breaking it into crumbly pieces.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t eat chocolate!\u201d Lulu snaps, looking horrified, as though I\u2019ve tried to peddle them cocaine. \u201cI\u2019ve brought some dried banana snacks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLulu, sweetie?\u201d A girl in a headset ducks down to our table. \u201cAre you ready to come and do the radio interview? And then we\u2019d like a photo of you and all the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Lulu bares her teeth in her horsey smile. \u201cCome along Cosmo, Ivo, Ludo....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo Dasher, go Dancer,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cSee you later!\u201d says Suze with a strained smile as they walk off. And all of a sudden I feel a bit ashamed. Lulu is Suze\u2019s friend and I should make the effort. I\u2019m going to be nice about her, I suddenly resolve. If it kills me.</p><p>\u201cSo...that was great, seeing Lulu!\u201d I try to inject some warmth into my voice. \u201cShe\u2019s right, we should all get together and have a good chat. Maybe we should meet up later on and have tea or something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d Suze\u2019s low voice takes me by surprise. I look over, and she\u2019s staring down into her cappuccino. Suddenly I recall Suze\u2019s reaction at Mum\u2019s house when I mentioned Lulu. That kind of tension in her face.</p> <p>\u201cSuze, have you and Lulu fallen out?\u201d I say cautiously.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Suze won\u2019t look up. \u201cI mean...she\u2019s done a lot for me. She\u2019s been so helpful, especially with the children....\u201d</p><p>The trouble with Suze is, she never wants to be nasty. So she always starts off bitching about people with a little speech about how lovely they are really.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I prompt her.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s so bloody perfect!\u201d As Suze raises her head, her cheeks are all pink. \u201cShe makes me feel like a total failure. Especially when we go out together. She always has homemade risotto or something and her children eat it. And they\u2019re never naughty, and they\u2019re all really bright....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour children are bright!\u201d I retort indignantly.</p><p>\u201cLulu\u2019s kids are all reading Harry Potter!\u201d Suze sounds despairing. \u201cAnd Ernie can\u2019t even really speak much, let alone read. Apart from German phrases from Wagner. And Lulu keeps asking me if I played Mozart to him in the womb, and have I thought about extra tuition, and I just feel so inadequate....\u201d</p><p>I feel a hot surge of outrage. How dare anyone make Suze feel inadequate!</p> <p>\u201cSuze, you\u2019re a brilliant mother!\u201d I say. \u201cAnd Lulu\u2019s just a cow. I knew it, the moment I met her. Don\u2019t listen to her anymore. And don\u2019t read her stupid cookbook!\u201d I put an arm round Suze\u2019s shoulders and squeeze tight. \u201cIf you feel inadequate, how do you think I feel? I don\u2019t even know any nursery rhymes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon!\u201d Lulu\u2019s amplified voice suddenly booms out from behind us, and we both turn round. She\u2019s sitting on a raised platform, opposite a woman in a pink suit, with a small audience watching. Two of her children are on her lap, and behind her are huge posters for her book, with a notice saying \u201cSigned Copies Available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of parents are simply lazy when it comes to feeding their children,\u201d she\u2019s saying with a pitying smile. \u201cIn my experience, all children like the taste of such things as avocado, monk-fish, or a good homemade polenta.\u201d</p><p>Suze and I exchange glances.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to feed the twins,\u201d mutters Suze. \u201cI\u2019ll go and do it in the \u2018Mother and Baby\u2019 area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it here!\u201d I protest. \u201cThey\u2019ve got highchairs\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cNo way, not with Lulu around.

You know, things the baby will actually need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, yes.\u201d I nod. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p> <p>I head down the aisles as fast as I can, trying to get away from Lulu\u2019s grating voice.</p><p>\u201cTelevision is the most dreadful influence,\u201d she\u2019s saying. \u201cAgain, I would say it\u2019s just sheer laziness on the part of the parents. My children have a program of stimulating educational activities\u2014\u201d</p><p>Stupid woman. Trying to ignore her, I pull out my fair guide and am looking around to get my bearings, when a large sign attracts my attention. FIRST AID KITS \u00a340. Now, that\u2019s what we need.</p><p>Feeling rather grown-up and responsible, I park the pram and start to peruse the kits. They all come in cool cases, with different things in sections. Plasters...rolls of bandages...and the cutest little pink scissors. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve never bought a first aid kit before. They\u2019re fab!</p><p>I take the kit up to the checkout, where a lugubrious-looking man in a white coat is sitting on a stool. He starts tapping at his till and I pick up a MediSupply Professional catalog, which is pretty dull. It\u2019s mostly rolls of elastic tape, and industrial-size bottles of aspirin, and\u2014</p> <p>Ooh. A stethoscope. I\u2019ve always wanted a stethoscope.</p><p>\u201cHow much is the stethoscope?\u201d I say casually.</p><p>\u201cStethoscope?\u201d The man gives me a suspicious look. \u201cAre you a doctor?\u201d</p><p>Honestly. Are only doctors allowed to buy stethoscopes, or something?</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d I admit at last. \u201cCan I still have one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything in the catalog is available to order online.\u201d He gives a grudging shrug. \u201cIf you want to pay \u00a3150. They\u2019re not toys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know they\u2019re not!\u201d I say with dignity. \u201cI actually think every parent should have a stethoscope in the house for emergency purposes. And a home heart defibrillator,\u201d I add, turning the page. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stop midflow.

Thanks.\u201d I hand over my credit card and the man swipes it.</p><p>A voice comes from behind me. \u201cHow\u2019s little Tallulah-Phoebe?\u201d It\u2019s the woman in the dark red raincoat again. She\u2019s clutching a hobbyhorse wrapped up in plastic, and peering into the ever-more-laden pram, which I parked by the display of first aid boxes. \u201cShe is a good girl, isn\u2019t she? Not a peep!\u201d</p><p>I feel a prickle of alarm.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s, um...sleeping,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI\u2019d leave her alone, actually....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me just have a little look! I don\u2019t know how she can sleep with all these packages on her pram. Can you, Tallulah-Phoebe?\u201d the woman croons, pushing aside all my plastic bags.</p><p>\u201cPlease leave her alone!\u201d I start toward the pram. \u201cShe\u2019s very sensitive...she doesn\u2019t like strangers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone!\u201d the old woman cries, and stands bolt upright, pale with fear. \u201cThe baby\u2019s gone! Only her little blanket\u2019s left!\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d My face floods with color. \u201cActually...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss, your credit card doesn\u2019t work,\u201d says the man at the till.</p><p>\u201cIt must work!\u201d I turn back, momentarily distracted. \u201cI only got it last week\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby\u2019s been abducted!\u201d</p><p>To my horror, the raincoat woman has bustled out of the stand and accosted a security guard, still clutching the lacy blanket. \u201cLittle Tallulah-Phoebe\u2019s gone! A baby\u2019s disappeared!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d a blond woman cries out in horror. \u201cA child\u2019s been abducted!

They\u2019ll lynch me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone through. Do you have a PIN number?\u201d says the man at the till, who looks totally unmoved by all the fuss.

Never.</p><p>\u201cI...um...\u201d My voice isn\u2019t working properly. \u201cI should probably...explain something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Both men are looking at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d Suddenly I hear Suze\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I look up, and there\u2019s Suze, pushing the double buggy with one arm and holding Clementine in the other.</p> <p>Thank God, thank God, thank God\u2014</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d I say, grabbing Clementine from Suze, my voice high with relief. \u201cCome here, Tallulah-Phoebe!\u201d</p><p>I hug Clementine tight, trying to hide the fact that she\u2019s leaning out of my arms in a desperate attempt to get back to Suze.</p><p>\u201cIs this the missing child?\u201d A security guard is looking Clementine up and down.</p><p>\u201cMissing child?\u201d Suze looks incredulous. She turns and takes in the crowd around us. \u201cBex, what on earth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI completely forgot that you\u2019d taken little Tallulah-Phoebe off for lunch!\u201d I say in shrill tones. \u201cSilly me! And everyone thought she\u2019d been kidnapped!\u201d I\u2019m desperately imploring her with my eyes to play along.</p><p>I can see her brain working it all out. The great thing about Suze is that she knows me pretty well.</p><p>\u201cTallulah-Phoebe?\u201d she says at last, in tones of incredulity, and I give a slight, shamefaced shrug.</p> <p>\u201cBaby Tallulah-Phoebe\u2019s back!\u201d The raincoat woman is spreading the news joyfully among the passersby. \u201cWe\u2019ve found her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this woman?\u201d The security guard regards Suze with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend,\u201d I say quickly, before they arrest Suze for abducting her own baby. \u201cActually, I think we should probably go....\u201d I squish Clementine into my pram as best I can amid all the packages, and maneuver it into a getaway position.</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d Clementine is still stretching out her hands toward Suze. \u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Suze\u2019s face lights up like a beacon. \u201cDid you hear that? She said Mama! Clever girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re off now,\u201d I say hurriedly to the guards. \u201cThank you so much for all your help. You\u2019ve got a great security system....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d One of the guards is frowning in suspicion. \u201cWhy did the baby say \u2018Mama\u2019 to this lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...she\u2019s called Mamie,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cClever Tallulah-Phoebe, that\u2019s your aunty Mamie! Aunty Mama! Let\u2019s go home now....\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t quite look at Suze as we head toward the exits. On the loudspeakers, the DJ is saying, \u201cAnd baby Tallulah-Phoebe has been found, safe and well....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you want to tell me what that was all about, Bex?\u201d Suze says at last, without turning her head.</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cNot really. Shall we go and have a cup of tea instead?\u201d</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>SUZE AND I spend the rest of the day together, and it\u2019s just fab. We dump all our parcels in Suze\u2019s enormous Range Rover, then she drives to the King\u2019s Road and we have tea at a great children-friendly place with ice-cream sundaes and everything. (I am always having crayons on the table from now on.) Then we go to Steinberg &amp; Tolkien, and I buy a vintage cardigan and Suze buys an evening bag, and then it\u2019s time for supper, so we go to Pizza on the Park, where a jazz group is warming up and they let the twins bang their fists on the drums. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then at last, we lift the sleeping babies into the Range Rover and Suze gives me a lift home. It\u2019s about ten by the time we drive in past the porter\u2019s lodge and pull up in front of the entrance to the building. I call Luke on my mobile to help us upstairs with all my stuff.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he says as he takes in the pile of bags on the ground. \u201cSo, is this it? Is the nursery complete now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d It\u2019s just occurred to me that I never did buy a sterilizer. Or a nursing pillow or any diaper rash cream. But never mind. I\u2019ve still got fifteen weeks to go. Plenty of time.</p><p>As Luke struggles into the flat with the paddling pool and hobbyhorse and about six carriers, I quickly take the bag with the Gender Predictor Kit and hide it in my underwear drawer. I\u2019ll have to choose a moment when he\u2019s out.</p> <p>Suze has popped into the bathroom to change one of the twins and as I emerge from the bedroom she\u2019s lugging both car seats down the corridor.</p><p>\u201cCome and have a glass of wine,\u201d Luke says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get going,\u201d she says regretfully. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have a glass of water if you\u2019ve got one.\u201d</p><p>We head into the kitchen, where a CD is softly playing Nina Simone songs. A half-empty bottle of wine is open on the counter, with two glasses next to it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having wine,\u201d I begin.</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t for you,\u201d says Luke, filling a glass of water from the fridge. \u201cVenetia popped round earlier.\u201d</p><p>I feel a shot of surprise. Venetia was here?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some extra paperwork we need to fill out,\u201d Luke continues. \u201cShe passes this way anyway, so she dropped it off on her way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cThat was...helpful of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just left, actually.\u201d Luke hands Suze the glass. \u201cYou missed her by a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Hang on. It\u2019s gone ten o\u2019clock. Does that mean she\u2019s been here all evening?</p> <p>I mean, not that I mind or anything. Of course I don\u2019t. Venetia is just Luke\u2019s friend. His beautiful, ex-girlfriend, platonic old friend.</p><p>I\u2019m aware of Suze\u2019s eyes boring into me, and quickly look away.</p><p>\u201cBex, can you show me the nursery before I leave?\u201d she says, her voice strangely high-pitched. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>She practically hustles me down the corridor and into the spare room, which we\u2019re calling the nursery even though we\u2019ll have moved by the time the baby arrives.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Suze shuts the door and turns to face me, agog.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shrug, pretending I don\u2019t know what she means.</p><p>\u201cIs that normal? To \u2018pop round\u2019 to your ex\u2019s house and stay all evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. Why shouldn\u2019t they catch up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust the two of them? Drinking wine?\u201d Suze utters the word like some Baptist teetotal preacher.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re friends, Suze!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cOld...very good...platonic...friends.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the little room.</p><p>\u201cOK, Bex,\u201d Suze says at last, lifting her hands as though in surrender. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am! I\u2019m totally, completely, one hundred percent...\u201d I trail off and start fiddling with a Christian Dior bottle warmer. I\u2019m clicking the lid on and off like some obsessive-compulsive. Suze has wandered over to the wicker toy hamper and is examining a little woolly sheep. For a while we\u2019re both silent, not even looking at each other.</p><p>\u201cAt least...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I swallow several times, not wanting to admit it. \u201cWell,\u201d I say at last, trying to sound matter-of-fact. \u201cWhat if...just hypothetically...what if I weren\u2019t sure?\u201d</p><p>Suze raises her head and meets my gaze. \u201cIs she pretty?\u201d she says in equally matter-of-fact tones.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not just pretty. She\u2019s stunning. She\u2019s got red shiny hair and these amazing green eyes and really toned arms....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCow,\u201d says Suze automatically.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s clever, and she wears great clothes, and Luke really likes her....\u201d The more I say, the less confident I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>\u201cLuke loves you!\u201d Suze cuts in. \u201cBex, remember, you\u2019re his wife. You\u2019re the one he chose. She\u2019s the reject.\u201d</p><p>That makes me feel better. \u201cReject\u201d makes me feel a lot better.</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not after him.\u201d Suze starts pacing up and down, pensively tapping the woolly sheep on her palm. \u201cWe have several options here. One: she genuinely is just a friend and you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod earnestly.</p><p>\u201cTwo: she came by this evening to check the lay of the land.

Four\u2014\u201d She stops herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s four?\u201d I say in dread.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t four,\u201d says Suze quickly. \u201cI reckon it\u2019s two. She came to scope things out. See the home territory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo...what do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let her know you\u2019re onto her.\u201d Suze raises her eyebrows meaningfully. \u201cWoman-to-woman.\u201d</p><p>Woman-to-woman? Since when did Suze get so worldly-wise and cynical? She sounds like she should be wearing a pencil skirt and blowing cigarette smoke in some film noir.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you seeing her again?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNext Friday. We\u2019ve got a checkup appointment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d Suze sounds firm. \u201cGo in there, Bex, and stake your claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStake my claim?\u201d I say uncertainly. \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve staked my claim on anything before. Except maybe a pair of boots in a Barneys sale.</p><p>\u201cGive off discreet little signals,\u201d Suze says in knowledgeable tones. \u201cShow her Luke belongs to you. Put your arm round him...talk about your great life together.... Just nip any little ideas she might have in the bud. And make sure you look fabulous. But not like you\u2019ve made any effort.\u201d</p><p>Discreet little signals. Our great life together. Look fabulous. I can do that.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Luke about the baby, by the way?\u201d Suze asks casually. \u201cIs he excited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI just read this piece in a magazine the other day about men who can\u2019t cope with the idea of becoming a father. Apparently they often have affairs to compensate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOften?\u201d I echo in dismay. \u201cHow often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...about half the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean...a tenth,\u201d Suze amends hastily. \u201cI can\u2019t remember what it said, actually. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not Luke. But still, it might be worth talking to him about fatherhood. The article said some men can only see the pressures and stresses of having a child, and you have to paint a positive picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod, trying to take all this information in. \u201cOK. I\u2019ll do that. And Suze...\u201d I pause awkwardly. \u201cThanks for not saying \u2018I told you so.\u2019 You told me to steer clear of Venetia Carter and...maybe you were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never say \u2018I told you so\u2019!\u201d exclaims Suze in horror.</p><p>\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t. But loads of people would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, they shouldn\u2019t! And anyway, maybe you were right, Bex. Maybe Venetia\u2019s not interested in Luke and it\u2019s all totally innocent.\u201d She puts the woolly sheep down and pats it on the head. \u201cBut I\u2019d stake your claim anyway. Just to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry.\u201d I give a determined nod. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Suze is so right. I need to give Venetia the message: Keep your hands off my husband. In a subtle way, of course.</p><p>As we arrive at the birth center on Friday I\u2019m dressed in my best \u201clooking fabulous with no effort\u201d outfit of Seven maternity jeans (frayed), a sexy red stretchy top, and my new Moschino killer heels. Which are a bit dressy maybe, but the frayed jeans compensate. When we arrive, the waiting room is pretty empty, with not a celebrity in sight, but I\u2019m so psyched up I don\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Luke looks down at my hand, gripping his. \u201cAre you all right? You seem tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...you know,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve just got a few concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have.\u201d He gives an understanding nod. \u201cWhy not share them with Venetia?\u201d</p><p>Yu-huh. That was the general plan.</p><p>We sit down on the plushy chairs, and I pick up a magazine, and Luke opens the FT with a rustle. I\u2019m about to turn to \u201cYour Baby\u2019s Horoscope\u201d when I remember Suze\u2019s words yesterday. I should talk to Luke about fatherhood. This is the perfect time.</p><p>\u201cSo...it\u2019s exciting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I say, putting my magazine down. \u201cBecoming parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Luke nods and turns a page.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t sound that excited. Oh God, what if he\u2019s secretly daunted by a life of diapers and is seeking refuge in another woman\u2019s arms? I have to paint a positive picture of parenthood, like Suze said. Something really good...something exciting to look forward to...</p><p>\u201cHey, Luke,\u201d I say, suddenly inspired. \u201cImagine if the baby wins a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry?\u201d He raises his head from the FT.</p><p>\u201cThe Olympics!

We\u2019ll be so proud!\u201d</p><p>My mind is totally seized by this idea. I can totally see myself at the stadium in 2030 or whenever, being interviewed by Sue Barker, telling her how I knew my child was destined for greatness, even from the womb.</p><p>Luke appears a bit bemused.</p> <p>\u201cBecky...have I missed something? What makes you think our child will win an Olympic gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might! Why shouldn\u2019t it? You have to believe in your children, Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Fair enough.\u201d Luke nods and puts his paper down. \u201cSo, which sport did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe long jump,\u201d I say after some thought. \u201cOr maybe the triple jump, because it\u2019s less popular. It\u2019ll be easier to win a gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr wrestling,\u201d suggests Luke.</p> <p>\u201cWrestling?\u201d I look at him indignantly. \u201cOur child\u2019s not doing wrestling! It might hurt itself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if its destiny is to become the world\u2019s greatest-ever wrestler?\u201d Luke raises his eyebrows. For a few moments I\u2019m flummoxed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI\u2019m its mother and I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Brandon?\u201d The receptionist calls over and we both look up. \u201cDr. Carter will see you now, if you\u2019d like to go through.\u201d</p><p>I feel a flurry of nerves. OK, here I go. Stake my claim.</p><p>\u201cCome on, darling!\u201d I put my arm firmly round Luke\u2019s shoulders and we head down the corridor, me staggering slightly because I\u2019m thrown off-balance.</p> <p>\u201cHello, you guys!\u201d Venetia is coming out of her room to greet us. She\u2019s dressed in black trousers and a sleeveless pink shirt cinched with the most fabulous shiny black crocodile belt. She kisses us both on each cheek and I catch a whiff of Chanel\u2019s Allure. \u201cGreat to see you again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you too, Venetia,\u201d I say, raising my eyebrow in an ironic if-you-have-any-plans-to-steal-my-husband-you-can-forget-about-them way.</p><p>\u201cMarvelous. Come on in....\u201d She ushers us into the room.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure she noticed my eyebrow maneuver. I might have to be more obvious.</p><p>Luke and I sit down, and Venetia perches on the front of her desk, dangling her Yves Saint Laurent heels. God, she\u2019s got a good wardrobe for a doctor. Or even not for a doctor.</p><p>\u201cSo. Becky.\u201d She opens her notes and studies them for a moment. \u201cFirst of all, we have the blood test results back. All your levels are fine...although we might want to watch that hemoglobin. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling great, thanks,\u201d I say at once. \u201cVery happy, very loving...Here I am, in a wonderful marriage, expecting a baby...and I\u2019ve never felt closer to Luke in my life.\u201d I reach out and grab Luke\u2019s hand. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree, darling? Aren\u2019t we particularly close at the moment? Spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and...and...sexually!\u201d</p><p>There. Take that.</p> <p>\u201cWell...yes,\u201d says Luke, looking slightly stunned. \u201cI suppose we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely to hear, Becky,\u201d Venetia says, giving me a strange look. \u201cAlthough I was really meaning your own physical state. Any faintness, nausea, that kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>Oh, right.</p><p>\u201cEr...no, thanks,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s pop you up and we can have a look.\u201d She gestures to the examination table and I obediently get up onto it. \u201cLie back, make sure you\u2019re comfortable.... Is that a little stretch mark I see?\u201d she adds gaily as I lift up my top.</p><p>\u201cA stretch mark?\u201d In horror I grab the metal side-grip and try to struggle up. \u201cI can\u2019t have! I use a special oil every night, and a lotion in the morning, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops, my mistake!\u201d says Venetia. \u201cJust a stray fiber from your T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I collapse in slight posttraumatic shock and Venetia starts feeling my abdomen.</p><p>\u201cAlthough, of course, stretch marks normally appear at the last minute,\u201d she adds conversationally. \u201cSo you may still get them. Those last few weeks of pregnancy can be cruel. I see my patients waddling in, desperate for their babies to be out....\u201d</p><p>Waddling?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to waddle,\u201d I say with a little laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you will.\u201d She smiles back. \u201cIt\u2019s nature\u2019s way of slowing you down. I always think it\u2019s only fair to give my first-time patients a heads-up on the realities to come in pregnancy. It isn\u2019t all roses and sunshine, you know!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d puts in Luke. \u201cWe appreciate that, don\u2019t we, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I mutter as Venetia wraps a blood pressure cuff round my arm.</p><p>This is a lie. I don\u2019t appreciate it. And just to make it crystal clear: I am never going to waddle.</p><p>\u201cBlood pressure\u2019s just a little high....\u201d She frowns at the screen. \u201cMake sure you take it easy, Becky. Try to take a rest every day, or at least get the weight off your feet. And try to stay nice and calm....\u201d</p> <p>Stay calm? How am I supposed to do that when she\u2019s telling me I\u2019ve got stretch marks and am going to waddle?</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s have a listen....\u201d She smears some gel on my stomach and gets out the Doppler, and I relax a little. This is my favorite bit of every appointment. Lying back, listening to the baby\u2019s heartbeat going wow, wow, wow over the fuzzy background noise. Remembering that there\u2019s a little person in there.</p><p>\u201cThat all sounds fine....\u201d Venetia moves away to the desk and scribbles something on her notes. \u201cOh, Luke, that reminds me \u2014 I spoke to Matthew the other day and he\u2019d love to meet up. And I found that article by Jeremy we were talking about....\u201d She rifles in her desk drawer and holds out an old copy of the New Yorker. \u201cHe\u2019s come such a long way since Cambridge. Have you read his book on Mao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d says Luke, heading toward the desk and taking it from her. \u201cI\u2019ll read this when I have time. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be busy,\u201d Venetia says sympathetically. She pours a glass of water from the cooler and offers one to Luke. \u201cHow are all the new offices working out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d Luke nods. \u201cThe odd hiccup, of course...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s fabulous that you\u2019ve got Arcodas as a client.\u201d She leans on the desk, frowning intelligently. \u201cIt must be the way forward, to diversify out of finance. And Arcodas\u2019s rate of expansion is phenomenal \u2014 I was reading a piece about it in the FT. Iain Wheeler sounds very impressive.\u201d</p><p>Er...hello?</p><p>They\u2019ve completely abandoned me on my back, like an upturned beetle. I clear my throat loudly and Luke turns round.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart! Are you all right?\u201d He hurries over and offers me a hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Becky!\u201d says Venetia. \u201cJust getting you some water. You seem a little dehydrated. It\u2019s vital to keep your fluids up. You should really be drinking at least eight glasses of water a day. Here you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I smile at her as I take the glass, but as I sit down, suspicions are circulating darkly round my mind. Venetia\u2019s very chatty with Luke. Too chatty. And trying to make out I had a stretch mark. And the way she keeps flicking her hair about like a hair model in a TV ad. It\u2019s not exactly doctorly, is it?</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d Venetia is behind her desk again, writing on my notes. \u201cDid you have any questions? Issues you\u2019d like to raise?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Luke, but he\u2019s pulled his phone out of his pocket. I can just hear the faint bzzz as it vibrates.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll pop outside. Carry on without me.\u201d He gets up and leaves the room, closing the door behind him.</p><p>So it\u2019s just the two of us. Woman-to-woman. I can feel the room prickling with tension.</p><p>At least...it\u2019s prickling on my side.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Venetia shows her perfect white teeth in a smile. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I reply pleasantly. \u201cAs I said, everything\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine.... Luke\u2019s fine.... Our relationship couldn\u2019t be better.... You know this is a honeymoon baby?\u201d I can\u2019t resist adding.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I heard all about your wonderful honeymoon!\u201d Venetia exclaims. \u201cLuke said you went to Ferrara while you were in Italy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d I give a reminiscent smile. \u201cIt was so romantic. We\u2019ll always share it as a wonderful memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Luke and I visited Ferrara, we couldn\u2019t tear ourselves away from those fabulous frescoes. I\u2019m sure he told you?\u201d Her eyes are all wide and innocent.</p><p>Luke and I never went to any frescoes in Ferrara. We sat at the same outdoor restaurant all afternoon, drinking Prosecco and eating the yummiest food I\u2019ve ever had. And he never mentioned he\u2019d been there before with Venetia. But no way am I admitting that to her.</p><p>\u201cActually, we didn\u2019t go to the frescoes,\u201d I say at last, examining my nails. \u201cLuke told me all about them, of course. But he said he thought they were overrated.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOverrated?\u201d Venetia seems taken aback.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I fix my gaze dead on hers. \u201cOverrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...he took masses of pictures of them.\u201d She gives an incredulous laugh. \u201cWe talked about them for hours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, we talked about them all night!\u201d I shoot back. \u201cAbout how overrated they are.\u201d</p> <p>I casually fiddle with my wedding ring, making sure my engagement diamond glints under the lights.</p><p>I\u2019m his wife. I know what he thinks about frescoes.</p><p>Venetia opens her mouth, then closes it again, looking flummoxed.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that!\u201d Luke enters the room, putting his phone away, and Venetia immediately turns to him.</p><p>\u201cLuke, d\u2019you remember those frescoes in\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOw!\u201d I clutch my stomach. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky! Darling!\u201d Luke hurries to my side in alarm. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little twinge.\u201d I give him a brave smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d I glance in triumph at Venetia, who is frowning as though she can\u2019t quite work me out.</p><p>\u201cHave you had these pains before?\u201d she says. \u201cCan you describe them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve gone now,\u201d I say blithely. \u201cI think it was just a stitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you have any other pains,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd remember to take things easy. That blood pressure shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but we don\u2019t want it to edge any higher. Did your previous doctor explain to you about preeclampsia?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Luke says, glancing at me, and I nod.</p><p>\u201cGood. Well, you take care. You can call me anytime. And before you go...\u201d Venetia opens her desk diary. \u201cWe must arrange an evening for us all to meet up. The twenty-fourth...or the twenty-sixth? Assuming I\u2019m not delivering a baby, of course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe twenty-sixth?\u201d Luke nods, consulting his BlackBerry. \u201cOK with you, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I say sweetly. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarvelous. I\u2019ll call some of the others. It\u2019s so great to have made contact again, after so many years.\u201d Venetia sighs and puts her pen down. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s been pretty hard, starting again in London. My old friends have their lives; they\u2019ve moved on. Besides which, I don\u2019t always keep sociable hours, and Justin travels abroad a lot, of course.\u201d Her bright smile slips a little.</p><p>\u201cJustin is Venetia\u2019s boyfriend,\u201d Luke explains to me.</p><p>The boyfriend. I\u2019d almost forgotten he existed.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say politely. \u201cWhat does he do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a financier.\u201d Venetia reaches for a framed picture of a dull-looking man in a suit, and as she surveys it her whole face lights up. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly driven and motivated, a bit like Luke. I sometimes feel left behind when he\u2019s pursuing a deal. But what can I do? I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say in surprise. Then I realize how that sounded. \u201cI mean...er...great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the reason I came to London.\u201d Her eyes are still fixed on the picture. \u201cI met him at a party in L.A. and just fell hook, line, and sinker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou moved all this way?\u201d I say, incredulous. \u201cJust for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what love\u2019s about, surely? You do crazy things for no rhyme or reason.\u201d Venetia looks up, her green eyes shining. \u201cIf my job has taught me one thing, Becky, it\u2019s that love is the only thing. Human love. I see it every time I deliver a baby right into its mother\u2019s arms...every time I see a fresh, eight-week-old heart beating on the screen and watch the faces of its parents...every time my patients come back, second or third time around. It\u2019s love that makes the babies. And you know what? Nothing else matters.\u201d</p><p>Wow. I am totally blown away.</p><p>She\u2019s not after Luke, after all. She\u2019s in love with the boring guy! And to be honest, that little speech has practically got me in tears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so right,\u201d I say huskily, clutching Luke\u2019s arm. \u201cLove is all that counts in this crazy, mixed-up world we call...the world.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure that came out right, but who cares? I have completely misjudged Venetia. She\u2019s not a man-eater; she\u2019s a warm, beautiful, loving human being.</p><p>\u201cI really hope Justin will be able to make the twenty-sixth.\u201d She finally puts the picture back in its place with a fond pat. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d I say with genuine enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee you soon, Ven.\u201d Luke kisses Venetia. \u201cThanks very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Becky.\u201d Venetia gives me a warm, friendly smile. \u201cOh, and I nearly forgot. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d be at all interested, but a journalist from Vogue called me up yesterday. They\u2019re doing a big feature on London\u2019s yummiest mummies-to-be and wanted me to put forward some names. I thought of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVogue?\u201d I stare at her, frozen.</p><p>\u201cYou may not be interested, of course. It would involve a photo shoot of you in the baby\u2019s nursery, an interview, hair and makeup.... They\u2019ll provide designer maternity clothes....\u201d She gives a vague shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 is that your kind of thing?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m practically hyperventilating. Is it my kind of thing? Is having my makeup done and wearing designer clothes and being in Vogue...my kind of thing?</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a yes,\u201d says Luke, looking at me in amusement.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Venetia touches him on the hand. \u201cLeave it to me. I\u2019ll fix it up.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca Brandon 37 Maida Vale Mansions</p><p>Maida Vale</p> <p>London NW6 0YF</p><p>18 August 2003</p><p>Dear Fabia,</p><p>I just wanted to say how much we love your gorgeous, beautiful house.

Who could forget the girl who started the \u201cfriendship handbags\u201d craze of 1989?</p><p>I am delighted you are to appear in Vogue \u2014 and it is, as you say, a surprise. Though I must assure you, the teachers did not sit in the staff room, saying \u201cI bet Becky Bloomwood never makes it into Vogue.\u201d</p><p>I will be sure to buy an issue, although I think it unlikely the headmistress will sanction buying an official commemorative copy for each pupil, as you suggest.</p><p>With very best wishes,</p><p>Lorna Hargreaves</p><p>Librarian</p><p>P.S. Do you still have a copy of In the Fifth at Malory Towers? There is a rather large fine on it.</p><p>NINE</p><p>I\u2019M GOING to be in Vogue! Last week Martha, who is the girl writing the Yummiest Mummies-to-Be feature, rang up and we had the most brilliant long chat.</p><p>Maybe I did make up a few teeny things. Like my daily exercise regime. And having freshly crushed raspberries for breakfast every morning, and how I write poetry to my unborn child. (I can always get some out of a book.) Plus I\u2019ve said we already live in the house on Delamain Road, because it sounds better than living in a flat.</p><p>But the point is, we will be living in it very soon. It\u2019s practically ours already. And the girl was really interested to hear about the his and hers nurseries. She said she thought they\u2019d be a highlight of the shoot. A highlight!</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>A voice cuts into my thoughts and I look up to see Eric heading across the floor toward me. Quickly I hide my lists under a MaxMara catalog and scan the shop floor to make sure there isn\u2019t some lurking customer I\u2019ve missed. But there\u2019s no one. Trade hasn\u2019t exactly picked up in the last few days.</p><p>Truth be told, we\u2019ve had yet another disaster. Someone in marketing decided to start a \u201cword on the street\u201d campaign, hiring students to talk about The Look and hand out leaflets in caf\u00e9s. Which would have been great if they hadn\u2019t handed them to a gang of shoplifters, who proceeded to come in and pinch the entire range of Benefit cosmetics. They were caught \u2014 but even so. The Daily World had a total field day, about how \u201cThe Look is so desperate, it\u2019s now inviting in convicted criminals.\u201d</p><p>The place feels emptier than ever, and to cap it all, five members of the staff resigned this week. No wonder Eric looks so grumpy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jasmine?\u201d He glances around the personal shopping reception area.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...in the stock room,\u201d I lie.</p><p>Actually, Jasmine is asleep on the floor in one of the dressing rooms.

No green ones.\u2019 I mean, what is this nonsense?\u201d He flicks the paper in exasperation. \u201cWhat\u2019s he expecting, that someone\u2019s just going to sit for hours, removing green jelly beans and disposing of them?\u201d</p><p>Ooh. I love green jelly beans.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind taking care of that,\u201d I say casually.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d Eric sighs. \u201cWell, all I can say is, I hope all this effort and money is worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be!\u201d I say, surreptitiously touching the wooden desk for luck. \u201cDanny\u2019s the hottest designer around! He\u2019ll come up with something totally brilliant and directional and now. And everyone will flock to the store. I promise!\u201d</p><p>I really, really hope I\u2019m right.</p><p>As Eric stalks off again I wonder whether to call Danny and see if he\u2019s had any ideas yet. But before I can do so, my cell phone rings.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d comes Luke\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, hi!\u201d I lean back in my chair, ready to have a chat. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve just been hearing about Danny\u2019s contract. You\u2019ll never guess what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t make this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My smile slips away.</p><p>This afternoon is our first prenatal class. It\u2019s the one that birth partners come to, and we do breathing and make friends for life. And Luke promised to be there. He promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He seems distracted. \u201cI know I said I\u2019d be there, but there\u2019s a...crisis at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA crisis?\u201d I sit up, concerned.</p><p>\u201cNot a crisis,\u201d he amends at once. \u201cIt\u2019s just...something\u2019s happened which isn\u2019t so good. It\u2019ll be fine. Just a hiccup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust...a minor internal dispute. I won\u2019t go into it. But I\u2019m really sorry about this afternoon. I wanted to be there.\u201d He does sound genuinely torn up. There\u2019s no point getting cross with him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d I hide a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t someone else go with you? Suze, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s an idea. I was Suze\u2019s birth partner, after all. We\u2019re pretty close friends. And it would be nice to have some company.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I nod. \u201cSo, will you still be all right for this evening?\u201d</p><p>Tonight we\u2019re going out with Venetia and her boyfriend and all Luke\u2019s old friends from Cambridge. I\u2019ve been really looking forward to it; in fact, I\u2019m having my hair blow-dried especially.</p><p>\u201cHope so. I\u2019ll keep you posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. See you later.\u201d</p><p>I ring off and am about to dial Suze\u2019s number, when I remember she\u2019s taking Ernie to some new playgroup this afternoon. So she won\u2019t be able to make it. I lean back in my chair, thinking hard. I could just go on my own; I mean, I\u2019m not scared of a bunch of pregnant women, am I?</p><p>Or else...</p><p>I pick up my phone again and speed-dial a number.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mum,\u201d I say as soon as I get through. \u201cAre you doing anything this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>The prenatal class is being held in a house in Islington and is called Choices, Empowerment, Open Minds, which I think is a really good title. I definitely have an open mind. As I walk along the street toward the house, I see Mum pull up in her Volvo and park \u2014 after about eight attempts, a small crash with a dustbin, and the help of a lorry driver who gets out of his cab to guide her in.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mum!\u201d I call as she gets out at last, looking a bit flustered. She\u2019s wearing smart white trousers, a navy blazer, and shiny patent loafers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Her face lights up. \u201cYou look wonderful, darling. Come along, Janice!\u201d She bangs on the car window. \u201cI brought Janice along. You don\u2019t mind, do you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...no,\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was at a loose end, and we thought we might go to Liberty\u2019s afterward to look at fabrics for the nursery. Dad\u2019s painted it yellow, but we haven\u2019t decided on curtains....\u201d She glances at my bump. \u201cAny inklings on whether it\u2019s a boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>My mind flicks to the Gender Predictor Kit, still hidden in my underwear drawer three weeks after I bought it. I keep getting it out, then losing my nerve and putting it back. Maybe I need Suze as moral support.</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>The passenger door opens and Janice gets out, trailing a bundle of knitting.</p><p>\u201cBecky, love!\u201d she says breathlessly. \u201cDo you need to bleep the door, Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose it, then I\u2019ll bleep it,\u201d orders Mum. \u201cGive it a good slam.\u201d</p><p>I can see a pregnant girl in a brown dress ringing the bell of a house several doors down. That must be the place!</p> <p>\u201cI was just listening to a message from Tom,\u201d Janice says, bundling her knitting into a straw bag, together with a mobile phone. \u201cI\u2019m seeing him later. He\u2019ll be full of Jess! It\u2019s Jess this, Jess that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cAnd Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Her whole face is shining. \u201cThey do make a lovely couple. I don\u2019t want to hope, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, remember, Janice,\u201d says Mum firmly. \u201cYou can\u2019t chivvy these young things.\u201d</p><p>Jess and Tom are going out? And she hasn\u2019t even told me? Honestly. I asked her the morning after the party what was going to happen with Tom, and she just looked all embarrassed and changed the subject. So I assumed it hadn\u2019t taken.</p><p>I can\u2019t help feeling a bit miffed. The whole point of having a sister is that you phone her up and tell her about your new boyfriend. Not keep her totally out of the loop.</p> <p>\u201cSo...Jess and Tom are in a relationship?\u201d I say, to make sure.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re very close.\u201d Janice nods vigorously. \u201cVery, very close. And I have to say, Jess is a super girl. We get on like a house on fire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I try not to sound too surprised, but I can\u2019t see Janice and Jess having much in common.</p><p>\u201cOh yes! We all feel like family. In fact, Martin and I have put off our cruise next summer, just in case we have a\u2014\u201d She breaks off. \u201cWedding,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Wedding?</p><p>OK. I need to talk to Jess. Now.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d says Mum as we approach the door, which has a sign on it: PLEASE ENTER AND REMOVE YOUR SHOES.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly happens at a prenatal class?\u201d asks Janice, slipping off her Kurt Geiger sandals.</p> <p>\u201cBreathing and stuff,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cPreparing for the birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all changed since our day, Janice,\u201d puts in Mum. \u201cThey have childbirth coaches these days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoaches! Like tennis players!\u201d Janice seems tickled by this idea. Then her smile drops and she clasps my arm. \u201cPoor little Becky. You have no idea what you\u2019re letting yourself in for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, a bit spooked. \u201cWell...er...shall we go in?\u201d</p><p>The class is being held in what looks like a normal sitting room with beanbags arranged in a circle, on which several pregnant women are already sitting, with their husbands awkwardly perched beside them.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d A slim woman with long dark hair and yoga trousers comes over. \u201cI\u2019m Noura, your prenatal teacher,\u201d she says in a quiet voice. \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Noura!\u201d I beam at her and shake hands. \u201cI\u2019m Becky Brandon. This is my mum...and this is Janice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Noura nods knowingly and takes Janice\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a real pleasure to meet you, Janice. You\u2019re Becky\u2019s...partner? We have another same-sex couple coming later on, so please don\u2019t feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh my God! She thinks\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not lesbians!\u201d I cut her off hurriedly, trying not to giggle at Janice\u2019s bemused expression. \u201cJanice is just our neighbor. She\u2019s going to Liberty\u2019s with Mum afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Noura seems a bit let down. \u201cWell, welcome, the three of you. Take a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanice and I will get the coffees,\u201d says Mum, heading toward a table at the side of the room. \u201cYou sit down, Becky love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, Becky,\u201d says Noura as I lower myself gingerly onto a beanbag. \u201cWe\u2019re going round the room, introducing ourselves. Laetitia has just explained she\u2019s having a home birth. Where are you having your baby, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Venetia Carter at the Cavendish,\u201d I say, trying to sound nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d says a girl in a pink dress. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she do all the celebrities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Actually, she\u2019s a really close friend,\u201d I can\u2019t resist adding. \u201cWe\u2019re going out tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd have you considered what kind of birth you would like?\u201d continues Noura.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having the water birth with lotus flowers and Thai massage,\u201d I say proudly.</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d Noura marks something on her list. \u201cSo you\u2019d ideally like an active birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I picture myself lolling in a nice warm pool, with music playing and lotus flowers floating about, and maybe a cosmopolitan in my hand. \u201cNo, I think probably quite inactive, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want an...inactive birth?\u201d Noura appears nonplussed.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod. \u201cIdeally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pain relief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a special Maori birthing stone,\u201d I say confidently. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve done yoga. So I\u2019ll probably be OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Noura looks as though she wants to add something else. \u201cRight,\u201d she says at last. \u201cWell. There are birth plan forms in front of you and I\u2019d like everyone to fill one in. We\u2019ll take all the ideas as points of discussion.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a murmuring as everyone picks up their pencils and begins to chat to their partners.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d also love to hear from Becky\u2019s mother and Janice,\u201d Noura adds, as Mum and Janice rejoin the group. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to hear from older women who have been through birth and motherhood and can share their wisdom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, dear! We\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d Mum gets out a packet of mints. \u201cPolo? Polo, anyone?\u201d</p><p>I pick up my pencil, then put it down again. I must just quickly text Jess and find out what\u2019s going on. I take out my phone, find her cell number, and type out a text.</p><p>OMG Jess!!! R U going out w Tom????</p><p>Then I delete it. Too excited. She\u2019ll get all freaked out and never reply.</p><p>Hi Jess. How R U doing? Bex</p><p>That\u2019s better. I press Send and turn my attention back to the birth plan. It\u2019s a list of questions, with space to fill in answers.</p><p>1. What are your priorities in early labor?</p><p>I think hard for a moment, then write: \u201cLook good.\u201d</p> <p>2. How will you cope with pain in the early stages (e.g., warm bath, rock on all fours)</p><p>I\u2019m about to write \u201cGo shopping,\u201d when my mobile pings. It\u2019s a text back from Jess!</p><p>Fine, thanks. Jess</p><p>That is so Jess. Two words, giving nothing away. I immediately text back.</p><p>Are you seeing Tom??</p><p>\u201cSheets in, everybody.\u201d Noura\u2019s clapping her hands. \u201cIf you could all stop writing...\u201d</p><p>Already? God, this is like a school test. I hand my paper in last, pushing it into the middle so Noura won\u2019t see it. But she\u2019s leafing through all of them, nodding as she reads. Then she stops.</p><p>\u201cBecky, under \u2018priorities in early labor\u2019 you\u2019ve put \u2018Look good.\u2019\u201d She raises her head. \u201cIs that a joke?\u201d</p><p>Why is everyone staring at me? Of course it\u2019s not a joke.</p><p>\u201cIf you look good, you feel good! It\u2019s natural pain-relief. We should all have makeovers or get our hair done....\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m getting frowns and titters from around the room, all except a girl in a fab pink top, who\u2019s nodding in agreement.</p><p>\u201cSee you there!\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d rather do that than rock on all fours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr go shopping,\u201d I add. \u201cIt cures morning sickness, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping cures morning sickness?\u201d Noura interrupts me. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever I felt sick in the first few weeks, I used to go to Harrods and buy a little something to take my mind off it,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt really worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to order stuff online,\u201d agrees the girl in pink.</p><p>\u201cYou could add it to your list of remedies, maybe,\u201d I suggest helpfully. \u201cAfter ginger tea.\u201d</p><p>Noura opens her mouth, then closes it again. She turns to another girl, who has her hand up, just as my phone beeps with another text.</p><p>Kind of. J</p><p>Kind of? What does kind of mean? I quickly type.</p><p>Janice thinks U R getting married!

You can cope. All of you.\u201d</p><p>A nervous laugh goes around the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, contractions can be intense,\u201d Noura continues. \u201cBut your bodies are designed to withstand them. And what you must remember is, it\u2019s a positive pain. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll both agree?\u201d She looks over at Mum and Janice, who has got out her knitting and is clicking away.</p> <p>\u201cPositive?\u201d Janice looks up, horrified. \u201cOoh no, dear. Mine was agony. Twenty-four hours in the cruel summer heat. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on any of you poor girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have better drugs these days,\u201d chimes in Mum. \u201cMy advice is take everything they\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are natural, instinctive methods you can use,\u201d Noura puts in quickly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you found that rocking and changing position helped with the contractions?\u201d</p><p>Mum and Janice exchange doubtful glances.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said so,\u201d says Mum kindly.</p> <p>\u201cOr a warm bath?\u201d Noura suggests, her smile tightening.</p><p>\u201cA bath?\u201d Mum laughs merrily. \u201cDear, when you\u2019re gripped by agony and wanting to die, a bath doesn\u2019t really help!\u201d</p><p>I can tell Noura\u2019s getting a bit frustrated, by the way she\u2019s breathing more deeply and balling her hands into fists.</p><p>\u201cBut it was worth it in the end? The pain seemed a small price to pay, compared to the life-affirming joy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Mum gives me a doubtful glance. \u201cOf course, I was delighted to have my little Becky. But I did keep it at the one child. We both did, didn\u2019t we, Janice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever again.\u201d Janice shudders. \u201cNot if you paid me a million pounds.\u201d</p> <p>As I glance around the room I can see that all the girls\u2019 faces have frozen. Most of the men\u2019s too.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d says Noura, making an obvious effort to stay pleasant. \u201cWell, thank you for those...inspirational words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trouble!\u201d Janice waves her knitting cheerily.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to try a small breathing exercise now,\u201d Noura continues, \u201cwhich, believe it or not, will help with the contractions of early labor. I want you all to sit up straight and do some shallow breaths. In...out...that\u2019s right....\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m doing my shallow breaths, there\u2019s a ping from my mobile.</p><p>What?????</p><p>Ha! I stifle a giggle and text back.</p><p>Is it love???</p> <p>A few moments later my phone pings again with a new message.</p><p>We\u2019re having a few problems.</p><p>Oh God. I hope Jess is OK. I didn\u2019t mean to tease her.</p><p>It\u2019s quite tricky, doing shallow breathing and texting at the same time. So I abandon the shallow breathing and type.</p><p>What problems? Why didn\u2019t u tell me?</p><p>\u201cWho are you texting, love?\u201d says Janice, who has also abandoned shallow breathing and is consulting her knitting pattern.</p><p>\u201cOh...just a friend,\u201d I say lightly as another text arrives. Jess must have abandoned whatever she\u2019s doing too.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to bother you, it\u2019s stupid.</p><p>Honestly. How can Jess think she\u2019s bothering me? I want to know about her love life. I start texting U R my sister!!! when Noura claps her hands for attention.</p><p>\u201cRelax, everyone. Now, we\u2019re going to try a simple exercise, which should put your minds at rest. Your partner is going to take your arm and twist it, giving you an old-fashioned Chinese burn. And you are going to breathe through the pain. Focus your minds, stay relaxed.... Partners, don\u2019t be afraid to increase the pressure! And you\u2019ll see how you\u2019re a lot tougher than you thought! Becky, I\u2019ll take you, if that\u2019s OK?\u201d she adds, coming over.</p><p>My stomach flips nervously. I don\u2019t like the sound of an old-fashioned Chinese burn. Or even a newfangled one.

You see how you coped with that, despite your fears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I\u2019m almost breathless.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you learned something valuable there?\u201d She gives me a knowing look. \u201cSomething that puts your fears into perspective?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod earnestly. \u201cI learned I definitely want an epidural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a general anesthetic, darling,\u201d interjects Mum. \u201cOr a nice cesarean!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have a general anesthetic.\u201d Noura stares at her incredulously. \u201cThey don\u2019t just hand them out, you know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2019s going to the top place in London!\u201d Mum retorts. \u201cShe can have anything she wants! Now, darling, if I were you, I\u2019d have the Thai massage and the water birth before labor begins, then the epidural and aromatherapy to follow....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is labor!\u201d Noura shouts, clutching her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re having a baby, not ordering from a bloody room-service menu!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a shocked silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, more calmly. \u201cI...don\u2019t know what came over me. Let\u2019s have a short break. Help yourselves to drinks.\u201d</p><p>She heads out of the room, and a muted babble of chatter breaks out.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d says Mum, raising her eyebrows. \u201cI think someone needs to do their shallow breathing! Janice, shall we go to Liberty now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me finish this row....\u201d Janice clicks frantically with her knitting needles. \u201cThere! All done. Coming, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d I say, torn. \u201cMaybe I should stay to the end of the class.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that Noura knows what she\u2019s talking about!\u201d Mum says conspiratorially. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you everything you need to know. And you can help me choose a new handbag!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, then.\u201d I get to my feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>By the time I\u2019ve finished shopping with Mum and Janice and had my hair appointment, it\u2019s gone six. I arrive home to find Luke in the study. The lights are off, and he\u2019s just sitting there in the gloom.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d I put my bags down. \u201cIs everything OK?\u201d</p><p>He starts at my voice, and raises his head. I peer at him in surprise. His face is taut, with a deep crease between his brows. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says at last. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s fine to me. I come into the study, perch on the desk opposite him, and study his face.</p><p>\u201cLuke, what was the crisis at work today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a crisis.\u201d He musters a smile. \u201cI used the wrong word. It was just...an incident. Nothing important. It\u2019s all been resolved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d He strokes my arm. \u201cHow was the class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I cast my mind back. \u201cEr...it was fine. You didn\u2019t miss much. Then I went shopping with Mum and Janice. We went to Liberty\u2019s and Browns....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been overdoing it?\u201d He surveys me with concern. \u201cDid you take a rest? Remember what Venetia said about your blood pressure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I wave an arm in the air. \u201cNever felt better!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Luke glances at his watch. \u201cWe should be going soon. I\u2019ll take a quick shower and call a taxi.\u201d His voice is cheerful enough, but as he gets up I notice a tense set to his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLuke...\u201d I hesitate. \u201cEverything\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Luke takes both my hands in his. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. We have little crises every day. It\u2019s the nature of the job; you know it is. We deal with them and we move on. Maybe I am more preoccupied than usual. I\u2019m just very busy right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...OK,\u201d I say, mollified. \u201cGo and have your shower.\u201d</p><p>He heads down the corridor to our bedroom and I dump my bags in the hall. I am quite tired, actually, after my afternoon with Mum and Janice. Maybe I\u2019ll have a shower too, after Luke\u2019s finished. I could use my revitalizing rosemary gel and do some invigorating yoga stretches.</p><p>Or else I could have a quick Kit Kat. I go into the kitchen and am just getting the box down, when the doorbell rings. That can\u2019t be the taxi already.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I say into the intercom.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky?\u201d A crackly voice comes back. \u201cIt\u2019s Jess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jess?</p><p>I press the buzzer in astonishment.

I didn\u2019t even know she was in London.</p><p>\u201cThe taxi\u2019s booked for fifteen minutes\u2019 time.\u201d Luke puts his head round the kitchen door, wearing only a towel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get some clothes on,\u201d I say. \u201cJess is just coming up in the lift!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJess?\u201d Luke looks taken aback. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting her, were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I hear the gentle chime of the doorbell to our apartment and start giggling. \u201cQuick, get dressed!\u201d</p><p>I swing the door open to see Jess, dressed in jeans, sneakers, and a tight brown tank top, which actually looks quite cool in a seventies, retro way.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d She gives me a stiff hug. \u201cHow are you, Becky? I\u2019ve been seeing my tutor, and I thought I\u2019d drop by. I tried ringing, but the line was busy. Is it OK?\u201d</p><p>She looks slightly nervous. Honestly! As if I\u2019m going to say no, it\u2019s not, go away.</p> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I warmly clasp her back. \u201cIt\u2019s fab to see you. Come on in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought a present for the baby.\u201d She reaches in her rucksack and pulls out a brown romper, with I Will Not Pollute the World printed on the front in beige.</p><p>\u201cEr...fab!\u201d I say, turning it over in my fingers. \u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made of natural hemp,\u201d Jess says. \u201cAre you still planning an all-hemp wardrobe for the baby?\u201d</p><p>All-hemp? What on earth is she\u2014</p><p>Oh. Maybe I did say something like that at Mum\u2019s party, just to stop her lecturing me about evil bleached cotton.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going...part hemp, part other fabrics,\u201d I say at last. \u201cFor...er...biodiversity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d She nods. \u201cAnd I meant to say, I can get you a changing table on loan. There\u2019s a women\u2019s student cooperative which lends out baby equipment and toys. I\u2019ve brought the number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I quickly kick the door of the nursery shut before she spots my Circus Tent changing station with integrated puppet show, which arrived yesterday from Funky Baba. \u201cI\u2019ll...bear that in mind. Come and have a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you made the baby wipes yet?\u201d Jess follows me into the kitchen.</p><p>Not the baby wipes again. I can\u2019t tell her I threw all the rags away at Mum\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cEr, not yet...\u201d I hastily cast around. \u201cBut I\u2019ve done some other stuff.\u201d I grab a striped tea towel from the rack and tie a knot in the end. \u201cThis is a homemade organic toy,\u201d I say casually, turning round. \u201cIt\u2019s called Knotty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Jess examines it. \u201cWhat a simple concept. Far better than any manufactured rubbish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m planning to...paint this spoon with nontoxic natural paint.\u201d Feeling emboldened, I take a wooden spoon from the drawer. \u201cI\u2019ll give it a face and call it Spoony.\u201d</p> <p>God, I\u2019m good at this eco-recycling lark. Maybe I\u2019ll start my own newsletter!</p><p>\u201cAnyway, let me get you a drink.\u201d I pour Jess a glass of wine and plonk down opposite her. \u201cSo. What\u2019s going on? I couldn\u2019t believe it when Janice said you were going out with Tom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Jess. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should have told you. But it\u2019s been so...\u201d She breaks off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, agog. Jess is staring into her glass without drinking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really working out,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Jess is silent again. She hasn\u2019t really cracked this whole talking-about-boyfriends thing, has she?</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d I cajole. \u201cEverything you say is totally safe with me. I mean...you do like him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. But...\u201d She exhales. \u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Luke puts his head round the door. \u201cOh, hi, Jess. I don\u2019t want to break things up, but we should be going soon....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have plans,\u201d says Jess, stiffening. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I put a hand on her arm. The one time Jess ever drops in on me and asks my advice, I\u2019m not sending her away. This is exactly what I imagined us doing when I first met her. Two sisters, popping round to each other\u2019s places, talking about boys....</p><p>\u201cLuke.\u201d I make a snap decision. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on ahead and I\u2019ll join you at the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re sure.\u201d Luke kisses me. \u201cGood to see you, Jess!\u201d</p><p>He heads out of the kitchen and as I hear the front door close I rip open a mini-packet of Pringles. \u201cSo. You like him....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s great.\u201d Jess is fiddling with the rough skin on one of her fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s bright, and interesting; he has sound views...and he\u2019s good-looking.

But to each their own.</p><p>\u201cSo the problem is...\u201d I circle my hands, prompting her.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s so needy. He calls me about ten times a day; he sends cards covered with kisses....\u201d Jess looks up with a disparaging expression and I can\u2019t help feeling a bit sorry for poor old Tom. \u201cLast week he tried to get my name tattooed on his arm. He phoned me to tell me he was doing it, and I got so angry, he stopped after J.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a J on his arm?\u201d I can\u2019t help giggling.</p><p>\u201cUp near his elbow.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cIt looks ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe he was trying to look cool,\u201d I suggest. \u201cYou know, Lucy wanted him to get a tattoo but he wouldn\u2019t. He probably just wanted to impress you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not impressed. And as for Janice...\u201d Jess thrusts her fingers through her cropped hair. \u201cShe rings me up nearly every day on some pretense or other. Have I had any thoughts about Tom\u2019s Christmas present? Do I want to join them on a wine-tasting weekend to France? I\u2019ve really had enough of it. So I\u2019m thinking of ending it.\u201d</p> <p>I look up in dismay. Ending it? But what about the baby being a ring-bearer?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t give up just because of a few little details!\u201d I protest. \u201cI mean, apart from the tattoo, are you getting on OK? Do you ever argue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a pretty big argument the other day.\u201d Jess nods as she says it.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSocial policy.\u201d</p><p>Oh, this just proves it. They\u2019re made for each other!</p> <p>\u201cJess, talk to Tom,\u201d I say on impulse. \u201cI bet you can work things out. Just for the sake of a tattoo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that.\u201d Jess wraps her arms round her knees. \u201cThere\u2019s...something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>With an intake of breath, it hits me. She\u2019s pregnant too. It has to be. God, how cool! We\u2019ll have babies together and they\u2019ll be cousins and we\u2019ll take cute pictures of them playing in the grass together....</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been offered a two-year research project in Chile.\u201d Jess\u2019s voice pricks my bubble.</p><p>\u201cChile?\u201d My mouth drops open in dismay. \u201cBut that\u2019s...miles away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven thousand,\u201d she says, nodding.</p><p>\u201cSo...are you going to go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided. But it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity. It\u2019s a team I\u2019ve wanted to join for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say after a short silence. \u201cWell, then...you should go.\u201d</p><p>I have to be supportive. This is Jess\u2019s career. But I can\u2019t help feeling a bit doleful. I\u2019ve only just got to know my long-lost sister, and now she\u2019s disappearing off to the other side of the world?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve pretty much decided that I will.\u201d She raises her head and I find myself looking right into her speckly hazel eyes. I\u2019ve always thought Jess had pretty eyes.</p><p>Maybe the baby will have speckly hazel eyes just like that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to send me lots of pictures of my niece or nephew,\u201d says Jess, as though reading my mind. \u201cSo I can see it grow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Every week.\u201d I bite my lip, trying to digest all this. \u201cSo...what about Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told him yet.\u201d She hunches her shoulders. \u201cBut it\u2019ll mean the end for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily! You could have a long-distance relationship.... There\u2019s always e-mail....\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor two years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I trail off. Maybe she\u2019s right. They met only a few weeks ago. And two years is a pretty long time.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give up a chance like this for some...man.\u201d She sounds like she\u2019s arguing with herself. Maybe she\u2019s more torn than she\u2019s letting on. Maybe, underneath it all, she really has fallen for Tom.</p><p>But even I can see it. Jess\u2019s work has been her life. She can\u2019t just abandon it now.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go to Chile,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be amazing for you. And it\u2019ll work out with Tom. Somehow.\u201d</p><p>The Pringles seem to have disappeared, so I get up and head for the cupboard. I open the door and survey the shelves dubiously. \u201cWe\u2019re out of chips.... I\u2019m not supposed to eat nuts.... We\u2019ve got some old Ritz crackers....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, I brought some popcorn,\u201d says Jess, looking a bit pink about the face. \u201cToffee flavored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d I gape at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in my rucksack.\u201d</p><p>Jess brought toffee flavored popcorn? But...that\u2019s not organic. Or nutritious. Or made from farm-cooperative potatoes.</p> <p>I stare in astonishment as she reaches inside her rucksack for the packet. A DVD comes out too, all shiny in its cellophane, and she stuffs it back, her cheeks reddening further.</p><p>Hang on a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I grab it. \u201cNine Months? Jess, that\u2019s not your kind of film!\u201d</p><p>Jess looks totally caught out.</p><p>\u201cI thought it might be your kind of film,\u201d she says at last. \u201cEspecially now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou brought this for us to watch together?\u201d I say incredulously, and after a moment she nods.</p><p>\u201cI just thought...\u201d She clears her throat. \u201cIf you were at a loose end...\u201d</p><p>I cannot believe how touched I feel. The first time we ever spent an evening together I tried to get Jess to watch Pretty Woman, and believe me, it was not a success. But now here she is with popcorn and a Hugh Grant film. And telling me about her boyfriend. Just like I imagined having a sister would be like.</p><p>\u201cBut you have to go out.\u201d Jess is shoving the DVD back into the rucksack. \u201cIn fact, you should get going....\u201d</p><p>I feel a rush of affection for her \u2014 and all of a sudden I don\u2019t want to go anywhere. Why would I spend the evening in some crowded bar, talking to a lot of snobby Cambridge graduates I don\u2019t even know, when I could be spending time with my sister? I can meet Venetia\u2019s Mr. Wonderful some other time. Luke won\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d I say firmly, and tear open the popcorn. \u201cLet\u2019s stay in and have fun.\u201d</p> <p>We have the best evening. We watch Nine Months \u2014 Jess does Sudoku puzzles at the same time, but that\u2019s OK because I\u2019m reading Hello! magazine \u2014 and we conference-call Suze to ask her advice on Tom, and then we order pizza. And Jess doesn\u2019t even tell me how we could have made our own for 30p.</p><p>She leaves around eleven, saying that I must be tired, and I go to bed, wondering how late Luke will be. He must be having a good time too, to be out this long. When at last a stripe of light from the doorway lands on my face and makes me blink, I realize I must have fallen asleep, because I could have sworn I was receiving an Oscar from the Queen.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I sit up sleepily. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust gone one,\u201d whispers Luke. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I woke you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d I reach for the bedside light and switch it on. \u201cSo, how was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was good!\u201d There\u2019s an enthusiasm in Luke\u2019s voice that I wasn\u2019t expecting. I rub my bleary eyes and focus on him. His face is glowing and he has a kind of lightness and animation about him which I haven\u2019t seen in weeks, if not months. He strips off his tie and throws it on a chair. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten how much I had in common with all these old friends,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talked about things I haven\u2019t even thought about for years. Politics...the arts...My old friend Matthew runs a gallery now. He invited us to an exhibition. We should go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I can\u2019t help smiling at Luke\u2019s eagerness. \u201cHow fantastic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great, just taking a break from business.\u201d He shakes his head wonderingly. \u201cI should do it more. Get things in perspective. Relax a bit.\u201d He starts unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cSo, how was your evening with Jess?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was fab! We watched a movie and ate pizza. And I have to tell you her news....\u201d I suddenly yawn. \u201cMaybe tomorrow.\u201d I snuggle back down into the pillows and watch Luke get undressed. \u201cSo, what\u2019s Venetia\u2019s famous boyfriend like? Is he as boring as he looks in the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Luke says, hanging up his suit trousers.</p><p>I stop comfortably snuggling and turn my head in surprise. Venetia\u2019s boyfriend wasn\u2019t there? But I thought the whole point of the evening was to introduce us to Justin the wonder-boy financier.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve split up?\u201d I haul myself to a sitting position in bed. \u201cBut...I thought she loved Justin more than anyone else. I thought she moved halfway across the world to be with him and they were the happiest couple in the whole universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d Luke shrugs. \u201cThey were. Until three days ago. She was pretty upset about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the evening has taken on a totally different slant. It wasn\u2019t Luke being introduced to Venetia\u2019s long-term boyfriend. It was a newly single Venetia crying on Luke\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSo...did Venetia break it off?\u201d I ask casually. \u201cOr did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure which of them ended it.\u201d Luke heads into the bathroom. \u201cApparently he\u2019s gone back to his wife now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis wife?\u201d My voice shoots up like a rocket. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018his wife\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenetia thought they were separated in all but name.\u201d Luke turns on the taps and I can barely hear him. \u201cShe\u2019s had a tough time, romantically, poor old Ven. She always seems to fall for married men and get into complicated situations.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to stay calm here. Shallow breaths. Do not overreact.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of situations?\u201d I ask lightly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Luke is squeezing toothpaste onto his brush. \u201cDivorce proceedings...some scandal with a senior doctor at the hospital where she worked...There was an injunction in LA....\u201d He frowns at the tube. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly out of this stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Divorce proceedings? Injunctions? Scandals?</p><p>I can\u2019t reply. My mouth is opening and shutting like a goldfish. Every instinct in my body is on red alert.</p><p>She\u2019s after Luke.</p><p>I watch Luke cleaning his teeth as though with Venetia\u2019s eyes. He\u2019s wearing only pajama bottoms, and he\u2019s still tanned from the summer, and the muscles of his shoulders are rippling faintly as he brushes. Oh God, oh God. Of course she\u2019s after him. He\u2019s good-looking and he owns a multimillion-pound company and they had a romance when they were much younger. Maybe he was her first love and she\u2019s never given her heart to anyone else.</p><p>Maybe she was his first love.</p><p>There\u2019s a hollow kind of feeling in my stomach. Which is ridiculous, bearing in mind how much is in my stomach right now.</p> <p>\u201cSo!\u201d I try to sound confident and lighthearted. \u201cDo I need to be worried?\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s splashing water on his face. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I can\u2019t bring myself to say it. What am I implying, that I don\u2019t trust him? \u201cShe could maybe try going after single men!\u201d I change tack. \u201cThen life wouldn\u2019t be so complicated for her!\u201d I give a small laugh, but as Luke turns, he\u2019s frowning.</p><p>\u201cVenetia\u2019s made some...unwise choices. But none of them were deliberate or out of malice. She\u2019s just a hopeless romantic.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s defending her. I feel totally wrong-footed.</p><p>A bleep suddenly comes from Luke\u2019s jacket. He comes out of the bathroom, drying his face, and takes his phone out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a text from Venetia.\u201d He looks at it and smiles. \u201cLook. It\u2019s a picture of this evening.\u201d</p><p>I take the phone from him and study the display. There\u2019s Venetia, dressed for off duty in long, rangy jeans, a leather jacket, and high, spiky boots. She\u2019s gazing at the camera with a confident smile, her arm round Luke like she owns him.</p> <p>Home-wrecker flashes through my brain before I can stop it.</p><p>Well, she\u2019s not wrecking this home. No way. Luke and I have been through a lot over the years, and it\u2019ll take more than some swishy-haired, spiky-heeled doctor to break us up.

Without me. One time when I\u2019d already arranged to meet Suze, he said he might as well use the evening to see some friends, and it turned out the \u201cfriends\u201d was Venetia. Once with all the Cambridge gang at some big fancy dinner with their old tutor, where partners weren\u2019t invited. And once for lunch, which was apparently because she was going to be \u201cright by his office.\u201d Yeah, right. Delivering a baby in an office block?</p><p>That was when we had our teeny row, where I said (very lightly), that wow, he was spending a lot of time with Venetia \u2014 maybe too much? Whereupon Luke replied that she was feeling low right now and needed an old friend to talk to. So I said, \u201cWell, I feel low too when you go off partying without me!\u201d And Luke said that meeting up with his old university friends had been the highlight of his year, and it was his chance to switch off and if I came along too, I\u2019d understand. So I said, \u201cI\u2019d come if you\u2019d invite me.\u201d And he said he had invited me, and I said\u2014</p><p>Anyway. We said a few things.</p><p>That\u2019s all the evidence I have. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m calling it evidence \u2014 it\u2019s not like I think something\u2019s actually going on. I mean...it\u2019s a ludicrous idea. This is Luke I\u2019m talking about. My husband.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe anything\u2019s happening, Bex.\u201d Suze shakes her head and stirs her raspberry and apricot smoothie. She\u2019s come over for the morning so we can do the gender predictor test, but so far all we\u2019ve done is talk about Luke. Luckily the children are all in the living room, eating sandwiches and watching Teletubbies in a total trance (which Suze let them do only after I swore an oath never, ever to tell Lulu).</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it either!\u201d I spread my arms wide. \u201cBut they see each other all the time, and she\u2019s always texting him, and I have no idea what they talk about....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you stake your claim?\u201d Suze takes a bite of chocolate-chip cookie. \u201cLast time you saw her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally! But she didn\u2019t take any notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Suze ponders for a while. \u201cHave you thought about going to another doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI keep thinking about it. But I don\u2019t think it would make any difference. She\u2019s already made contact with Luke, hasn\u2019t she? In fact, she\u2019d probably love to get me out of the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does Luke say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well.\u201d I start fiddling with my straw. \u201cHe says she\u2019s all lonely and vulnerable since she split up from her boyfriend. He behaves like she\u2019s this poor tragic victim. And he always takes her side. I called her Cruella de Venetia the other day and he got really cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruella de Venetia.\u201d Suze splutters cookie crumbs over the counter. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good! We ended up having an argument! She\u2019s this...presence in our life, even though I never see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have appointments with her?\u201d Suze looks surprised.</p> <p>\u201cI have, but the last two times I\u2019ve been to the clinic she was with a client in labor, and I got seen by one of her assistant doctors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s avoiding you.\u201d Suze gives a knowing nod and slurps on her straw, her brow furrowed. \u201cBex, I know this is a really dreadful thing to suggest...but what about looking at Luke\u2019s texts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Suze looks agog.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in Latin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey both studied Latin at university,\u201d I say resentfully. \u201cIt\u2019s their \u2018thing.\u2019 I don\u2019t understand a word of it. But I wrote one down.\u201d I reach in my pocket and unfurl a small bit of paper. \u201cThis is it.\u201d</p><p>We both look at the words in silence.</p> <p>Fac me laetam: mecum hodie bibe!</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of that,\u201d says Suze at last.</p><p>\u201cNor do I.\u201d</p><p>We both regard the words for a few moments longer, then Suze sighs and pushes the paper back toward me. \u201cBex, I hate to say it...but you should be on your guard. In fact, you should strike back. If she can spend all this time with Luke, then so can you. When was the last time you did something romantic, just the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. Not for ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then!\u201d Suze slaps the table triumphantly. \u201cGo to his office and take him out for lunch as a surprise. He\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a good idea. I never want to bother Luke at work, because he\u2019s so busy. But if Venetia can do it, then why can\u2019t I? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOK, I\u2019ll try it,\u201d I say, cheering up. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.

Or maybe a girl.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bex, wait,\u201d says Suze suddenly. \u201cHow will you fool Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they deliver the baby!

Bex, you need to get into your character. You need to use some Method.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. Here we go. Suze went to drama school for a term before university, so she thinks she\u2019s practically Judi Dench. (It wasn\u2019t a real drama school, like RADA. It was a private one where your father pays and you do cooking in the afternoon. But we don\u2019t mention that.)</p><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d she instructs me. \u201cDo some loosening-up exercises....\u201d She rolls her head around and shakes out her arms. Reluctantly, I copy her. \u201cNow, what\u2019s your motivation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFooling Luke,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cNo! Your interior motivation. Your character.\u201d Suze closes her eyes for a moment, as if communing with the spirits. \u201cYou\u2019re a new mother. You\u2019re seeing your baby for the first time. You\u2019re delighted...yet surprised.... The sex is not what you expected.... You\u2019ve never been so amazed in your life.... Really feel it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...a boy!\u201d I clutch at my chest. Suze is whirling her arms at me.</p><p>\u201cMore, Bex! Again, with passion!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy! My God, it\u2019s a BOY!!!\u201d My voice resounds around the kitchen, and a spoon falls off the counter onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cHey, that was pretty good!\u201d Suze looks impressed.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I\u2019m panting.</p><p>\u201cYes! You\u2019ll definitely fool him.

Come on!\u201d She\u2019s fitting the needle to the syringe. \u201cRoll up your sleeve!\u201d</p><p>A sheep?</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do with the vial of blood?\u201d I ask, playing for time.</p><p>\u201cWe send it away to the lab,\u201d says Suze, reaching for the leaflet. \u201c\u2018Your results will be posted to you in anonymous, discreet packaging. Please expect them within\u2019\u201d\u2014she turns the page\u2014\u201c\u2018approximately ten to twelve weeks.\u2019\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cTen to twelve weeks?\u201d I grab the leaflet from her. \u201cWhat good is that? I\u2019ll have had it by then.\u201d I turn the pages over, trying to find some express delivery option, but there isn\u2019t one. At last I give up and subside onto a bar stool in disappointment. \u201cTwelve weeks. There\u2019s no point even doing it!\u201d</p><p>Suze sighs and sits down beside me. \u201cBex, didn\u2019t you read any of the instructions before you bought this test? Didn\u2019t you find out how it worked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...no,\u201d I admit. \u201cI thought it would be like a pregnancy stick test. With a blue line and a pink line.\u201d</p><p>Stupid rubbishy test. It cost me forty quid too. What a total rip-off. I mean, do they think pregnant women are that desperate to know what sex their baby is? It\u2019s only a few months to wait, for goodness\u2019 sake. And it\u2019s not like it matters. As long as it\u2019s a healthy baby, then really, what is the\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suze breaks into my thoughts. \u201cShall we do the ring test again?

So we make a great big list of boys\u2019 names and Suze tries to persuade me to call it Tarquin Wilfrid Susan. Yup. I don\u2019t think so.</p><p>By the time she\u2019s bundled up all the children, fed them lots of fish oil capsules (to counteract the dumbing-down effect of TV), and left, I feel a lot better. She\u2019s right \u2014 Luke and I just need to spend a bit more time together. And I\u2019ve thought of a much better plan than taking him out to lunch. I mean, he goes to boring old business lunches all the time. I want to do something different. Something romantic.</p> <p>So the next day at work, I phone down to the Food Hall and order a picnic basket of all Luke\u2019s favorite food. I\u2019ve already checked with Mel, his assistant, and he hasn\u2019t got any appointments booked for lunchtime. (I didn\u2019t tell her why I was asking, because there\u2019s no way she\u2019d keep it secret.) My plan is to surprise him and have a picnic lunch in his office and it\u2019ll be all intimate and lovely! I\u2019ve even got them to put in a bottle of champagne, a checked cloth, and a plastic \u201cpicnic\u201d candelabra from Homewares, just to set the scene.</p><p>As I set off for Luke\u2019s office at lunchtime I\u2019m feeling quite excited. It\u2019s been ages since we did something spontaneous like this! Plus I haven\u2019t been to Brandon Communications for weeks, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing everyone. There\u2019s been the most amazing buzz at the company, ever since they won the Arcodas pitch. The Arcodas Group is so huge, and so different from all the financial clients they normally deal with, it\u2019s been the biggest challenge they\u2019ve ever faced. (I know this from helping Luke write his motivational speeches.)</p><p>But then, what is life without new adventures and new dreams? Brandon Communications is the best in the business, stronger and more dynamic every year, thriving on new enterprises. Together they can take on any challenge, meet it, and conquer it. As a team. As a family. (I wrote that bit.)</p><p>I arrive at the offices just before one, and sidle across the marble foyer to Karen, the receptionist. She\u2019s talking to her colleague Dawn in a low voice, and she looks all pink and upset. I hope nothing\u2019s wrong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d I can hear her saying in a guarded voice as I approach the desk. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right.

I know I\u2019m old-fashioned\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Dawn interrupts her. \u201cIt\u2019s having respect for your fellow human beings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRespect.\u201d Karen nods vigorously. \u201cHow she\u2019s feeling, poor thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen her? Since...\u201d Dawn trails off meaningfully.</p><p>Karen shakes her head. \u201cNo one has.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m following their conversation with slight unease. What are they talking about? Who\u2019s \u201cshe\u201d?</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, and they both jump.</p> <p>\u201cBecky! Goodness!\u201d Karen looks quite flustered at the sight of me. \u201cWhat are you...Did we know you were coming today?\u201d She starts leafing through the papers on her desk. \u201cDawn, is it in the appointment book?\u201d</p><p>In the appointment book? Since when do I have to make an appointment to see my own husband?</p><p>\u201cI just thought I\u2019d surprise Luke. He\u2019s free at lunchtime; I\u2019ve already checked. So I thought we could have a nice picnic in his office!\u201d I nod at the basket hanging on my arm.</p><p>I\u2019m expecting them to say, \u201cWhat a lovely idea!\u201d But instead, Karen and Dawn both look kind of nervous.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d says Karen at last. \u201cWell. Let\u2019s just...see if...\u201d She presses a couple of buttons on her switchboard. \u201cHello, Mel? It\u2019s Karen at reception here. I have Becky here. Becky Brandon. She\u2019s here to...surprise Luke.\u201d There\u2019s quite a long silence, during which Karen listens intently. \u201cYes. Yes, I\u2019ll do that.\u201d She looks up and smiles at me. \u201cTake a seat, Becky. Someone will be with you shortly.\u201d</p><p>Take a seat? Someone will be with me? What on earth has happened to them?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just go straight up?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re...not quite sure where Luke is.\u201d Karen definitely looks shifty. \u201cIt\u2019s probably better if you...\u201d She clears her throat. \u201cAdam will be down shortly.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe this. Adam Farr is head of corporate communications at Brandon C. He\u2019s the guy they always summon for tricky situations. Luke says Adam is the consummate expert at handling people. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m being handled.

Weren\u2019t we, Dawn?\u201d</p> <p>Dawn is nodding agreement, but her eyes are edgy.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d says Karen. \u201cKeeping well, are you, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long to go, is it?\u201d puts in Dawn.</p><p>I try to think of a natural, friendly reply \u2014 but how can I? This whole conversation is fake. Just then, the lift doors open and Adam Farr strides out.</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d He has his corporate smile on and is slipping a BlackBerry into his pocket. \u201cWhat a pleasure to see you!\u201d</p> <p>This guy may be the smoothest operator in the company. But he is not fobbing me off.</p><p>\u201cHi, Adam,\u201d I say almost curtly. \u201cIs Luke around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just finishing up a meeting,\u201d says Adam without missing a beat. \u201cLet\u2019s go up and get you a coffee. I know everyone will be thrilled you\u2019ve dropped by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat meeting?\u201d I interrupt him, and I swear I see Adam flinch.</p><p>\u201cOn finance,\u201d he says after an infinitesimal pause. \u201cVery dull, I\u2019m afraid. Shall we?\u201d</p><p>Adam ushers me into the lift and we travel up for a while in silence. Now that I\u2019m up close to him, I can detect signs of strain in him, beneath the confident, business-y manner. There are shadows under his eyes, and he keeps tapping his fingertips together in the same rhythmic pattern, like a nervous tic.</p> <p>\u201cSo...how\u2019s life?\u201d I say. \u201cYou must all be really busy, with the expansion and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He nods.</p><p>\u201cAnd is it fun, working on all these different Arcodas projects?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I can see Adam\u2019s fingers tapping together faster and harder.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says at last, and nods again. The lift doors open, and he shows me out before I can say anything else.</p><p>A few Brandon C staff are standing there, waiting for the lift, and I smile and say \u201cHi!\u201d to the faces I know \u2014 but no one smiles back. At least not a genuine smile. Everyone seems taken aback to see me, and there are a few fake little flashes of teeth, and a couple of people say, \u201cHi, Becky,\u201d and then look down awkwardly. But nobody stops to talk. Not even to ask about the baby.</p><p>Why is everyone being so weird? Over by the water cooler I can see a couple of girls talking in lowered voices and glancing at me when they think I\u2019m not looking.</p><p>My stomach starts to churn. Oh God. Have I been totally naive? What do they know? What have they seen? A sudden vision comes to me, of Luke ushering Venetia down the corridor to his office, closing the door, and saying, \u201cPlease don\u2019t disturb us for an hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Luke\u2019s resounding voice makes me jump. \u201cAre you OK? What are you doing here?\u201d He\u2019s striding down the corridor toward me, flanked by his second-in-command, Gary, on one side, and some guy I don\u2019t know on the other, with a bunch of people following in their wake. They all look fairly stressed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I say, trying to sound cheerful. \u201cI just thought...we could have a picnic in your office.\u201d</p><p>Now that I say it, in front of all his staff, it sounds really stupid. I feel like Pollyanna, holding this stupid wicker basket. There\u2019s even a pink stripy bow tied round the handle, which I should have torn off.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I have a meeting.\u201d Luke shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mel said you didn\u2019t have anything booked!\u201d My voice is more shrill than I intended. \u201cShe said you\u2019d be free!\u201d</p><p>Gary and the others glance at each other and melt away, leaving Luke and me alone. My cheeks are prickling with humiliation. Why should I be made to feel stupid and in everyone\u2019s way, just for dropping in to see my husband?</p><p>\u201cLuke, what\u2019s going on?\u201d The words spill out before I can stop them. \u201cEveryone\u2019s giving me weird looks. You sent Adam down to \u2018handle\u2019 me. Something\u2019s wrong, I know it is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, no one\u2019s been handling you,\u201d Luke says patiently. \u201cNo one\u2019s giving you weird looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are! It\u2019s like Invasion of the Body Snatchers! No one\u2019s even smiling anymore! Everyone looks so tense, and strained....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re preoccupied, that\u2019s all.\u201d Despite his easy veneer, Luke seems rattled. \u201cWe\u2019re all working very hard right now. Including me. I really have to go.\u201d He kisses me. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the picnic at home, OK? Adam will call you a car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And the next minute, he\u2019s disappeared into the lift, leaving me alone with my basket and my jumping, unsettling thoughts.</p><p>A meeting. What meeting? Why didn\u2019t Mel know about it?</p><p>Now I\u2019m envisaging him hurrying into a restaurant where Venetia is waiting, cradling a glass of wine while all the waiters watch admiringly. She gets up, and they kiss, and he says, \u201cSorry I\u2019m late, my wife turned up\u2014\u201d</p><p>No. Stop it. Stop it, Becky.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t. Thoughts are piling into my head, thicker and faster, like a snowstorm. They\u2019ve been seeing each other every lunch hour. All the Brandon C staff know about it. That\u2019s why Karen and Dawn looked so awkward, that\u2019s why they tried to get rid of me....</p><p>The other lift is waiting with its doors open, and on impulse I get in. I reach the ground floor and walk as swiftly as I can manage out of the foyer, ignoring the calls of Karen and Dawn, just in time to see Luke being driven away by his company driver in the Mercedes. Frantically I hail a taxi, step in, and dump the basket on the seat.</p><p>\u201cWhere to, love?\u201d asks the taxi driver.</p><p>I slam the door and lean forward.</p><p>\u201cYou see that Mercedes up ahead?\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cFollow it.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually doing this. I\u2019m tailing Luke through the streets of London. As we drive round Trafalgar Square with the Mercedes in sight, I feel like I\u2019m in some kind of movie. I even find myself glancing through the rear window to check that there are no baddies in pursuit.</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend, is it?\u201d the taxi driver suddenly says in a strong South London accent.</p><p>\u201cHusband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought as much. Got another woman, \u2019as \u2019e?\u201d</p><p>I feel a horrible pang in my chest. How did he know? Do I look like the cheated-on partner?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I admit. \u201cMaybe. That\u2019s what I want to find out.\u201d</p> <p>I sit back and watch a bunch of tourists follow their tour leader across the road. Then it occurs to me that this taxi driver is probably a total expert on people following their partners to prove adultery. He probably drives them all the time! On impulse I lean forward and slide the dividing window across.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you think I should confront him? What do most people do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d We\u2019ve reached some snarled-up traffic and the taxi driver turns round to face me. He\u2019s got a long face like a sniffer dog, and dark, mournful eyes. \u201cDepends if you want to \u2019ave an open an\u2019 honest marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Risk is that by \u2019aving it out, you drive \u2019im into the arms of the other bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say doubtfully. \u201cSo...what\u2019s the other option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn a blind eye an\u2019 live a sham for the rest of your days.\u201d</p><p>Neither option sounds that great.</p> <p>We\u2019re edging along Oxford Street by now, making slow progress through all the buses and pedestrians. I\u2019m craning my neck, scanning the road ahead, when all of a sudden I glimpse Luke\u2019s Mercedes, turning into a side street.</p><p>\u201cThere! He went that way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw \u2019im.\u201d</p><p>The cabbie deftly changes lanes and a few moments later we\u2019re turning into the same side street. The Mercedes is at the end of the road, turning the corner.</p><p>My hands are starting to sweat. It almost felt like a game when I first hailed the cab. But now this is serious. At some point his car is going to stop and he\u2019s going to get out and...then what am I going to do?</p><p>We\u2019re winding round the narrow streets of Soho. It\u2019s a bright, sharp autumn day, and a few brave people are sitting out at pavement caf\u00e9s, cradling cups of coffee. All of a sudden, the taxi driver signals sharply and pulls up behind a van. \u201cThey\u2019re stopping.\u201d</p><p>I watch, breathless, as the Mercedes comes to a halt on the other side of the road. The driver opens the passenger door and Luke gets out, without even glancing in our direction. He consults a piece of paper, then heads to an unsalubrious-looking brown-painted door. He rings a buzzer and a moment later is admitted.</p><p>My gaze travels up to a battered sign hanging from a first-floor window: ROOMS.</p><p>Rooms? Luke has taken rooms?</p><p>I feel as if something\u2019s clenching me tightly round the chest. Something is going on. Venetia\u2019s up there. She\u2019s waiting for him in a black fur-trimmed negligee.</p><p>But why some grotty room in Soho? Why not the Four Seasons, for God\u2019s sake?</p><p>Because he\u2019d get spotted. He\u2019s come here because it\u2019s out of the way. It all makes sense....</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d Through a haze I realize the taxi driver is talking to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cYou want to sit here and wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I grab the picnic basket and thrust the door open. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll...take it from here. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a mo\u2019.\u201d He gets out and offers me a hand to help me step down from the cab. I scrabble in my bag and give him a wodge of cash without even counting it. The taxi driver sighs, peels off a few notes, and hands the rest back.</p> <p>\u201cNot used to this game, are you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cYou need any more help...\u201d He feels in his pocket and produces a gray business card. \u201cMy brother Lou.

Thanks.\u201d I pocket the card, barely aware of what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, love.\u201d The taxi driver gets back in his cab, still shaking his head, and drives away.</p> <p>I\u2019m standing outside the building with the \u201crooms\u201d sign. I could buzz at the door and see what happened.</p><p>No. What if she answered?</p><p>My legs suddenly feel wobbly. I need a seat. The ground floor of the building is a business print shop, and I find myself walking inside and sinking into a chair. What am I going to do? What?</p><p>\u201cHello there!\u201d A voice makes me jump and I turn to see a cheerful man in a short-sleeved striped shirt. \u201cAre you interested in some printing? We have a special offer on all our business cards. Vellum, laminated, textured...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...thanks.\u201d I nod, just to get rid of him.</p><p>\u201cHere you are!\u201d The man hands me a sample book and I start to leaf through it blindly. Maybe I should just go up and...and burst in. But what if I really do find them together?</p> <p>I\u2019m turning the pages more and more feverishly. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here, in the middle of Soho, wondering if my husband is upstairs with another woman.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s our form. If you\u2019ll just fill it in...\u201d The man has come back with a clipboard and pen, which he thrusts at me. On automatic pilot I take them from him and write \u201cBloomwood Inc.\u201d at the top of the page.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of business are you in?\u201d the man asks chattily.</p><p>\u201cUm...double-glazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble-glazing!\u201d The man frowns thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019d suggest a nice laminated white card with a border. With the address here and your company motto here...Do you have a motto?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor...for all your glazing needs,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cLondon, Paris, Dubai.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019m saying. The words are just coming out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cDubai!\u201d The man looks impressed. \u201cI\u2019ll bet they have a few windows out there!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey do.\u201d I nod. \u201cIt\u2019s the window capital of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, I never knew that!\u201d the man says with interest.</p><p>I stiffen. I just heard a rumbling-footsteps kind of noise. Someone\u2019s coming down the stairs.</p><p>Luke. It has to be.</p><p>Except...that was a bit quick, surely?</p><p>\u201cEr...thanks very much! I\u2019ll think about it....\u201d I shove the clipboard back at the man and rush out of the shop and into the street. In front of me the brown-painted door is slowly opening and I quickly edge behind a small tree.</p><p>My entire body is clenched with dread. Blood is rushing through my ears. Stay calm. Whatever happens, whoever he\u2019s with\u2014</p><p>The door swings open \u2014 and Luke steps out, followed by a couple of men in suits.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s discuss it over lunch,\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of clients I think could really benefit from that approach.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not with Venetia. He\u2019s not with Venetia!</p><p>I feel like doing a little dance on the pavement. Relief is flooding through me. How could I have thought he was up to anything? I\u2019m so paranoid. I\u2019m so stupid!

I forgot my bump would be poking out.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Luke swivels and stares at me in astonishment. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>I feel my cheeks turning beet red as the three men peer at me. \u201cEr...hi!\u201d I say brightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a mock-up of that business card, if you\u2019d like it.\u201d The print shop man is advancing on me.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I swipe it from him. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecky, what are you doing here?\u201d Luke is coming toward the tree.</p><p>\u201cJust...shopping!

Bye!\u201d At last, to my relief, the print shop guy retreats toward his door and there\u2019s a pause.</p><p>\u201cThe double-glazing trade?\u201d says Luke at last, a little bemusedly.</p><p>\u201cHe got...me confused with...someone else.\u201d I shove the mock-up card into my bag. \u201cSo, anyway, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeeting some possible new media consultants for the company.\u201d Luke still looks puzzled. \u201cLet me introduce Nigel and Richard.

Luke told us you weren\u2019t impressed by his client\u2019s performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d I feel a small glow. I didn\u2019t realize Luke had taken my advice, let alone told other people about it.</p><p>\u201cExcuse our less than salubrious office space,\u201d puts in the other man. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just moved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t even noticed!\u201d I say with a shrill laugh. \u201cAnyway, I must be off \u2014 I was just passing....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good afternoon.\u201d Luke kisses me.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I hold on to his arm for a moment. \u201cAnd maybe we can have our picnic later?\u201d</p> <p>Luke winces. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I should have said, I\u2019ll be late back tonight. New-client dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I can\u2019t help feeling disappointed. But new business is new business. \u201cWell, never mind.

Suspicions are rising up inside me, as thick and fast as ever.</p><p>\u201cSo...you\u2019re going to have meetings with her and everything?\u201d I wipe my damp upper lip.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the general idea, Becky.\u201d Luke raises his eyebrows quizzically. \u201cI\u2019ll send her your love, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I manage a smile. \u201cDo that!\u201d</p><p>Luke walks off with the two men, and I stare after them, my heart thudding.</p><p>OK, so maybe I got things a tad wrong today. But there\u2019s no doubt. She\u2019s after Luke. I know it deep down in my heart, just like I know my new orange top from eBay was a mistake.</p><p>Venetia\u2019s moving in on my husband.

Apart from work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Luke is loosening his tie. \u201cThe arts...books...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never read books!\u201d I say before I can stop myself. It\u2019s true. He doesn\u2019t, apart from how-to-run-your-magnificent-business-empire kind of books.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d he says, shooting me a wry look. \u201cBut I used to.\u201d</p><p>What does that mean? Before he met me? So now it\u2019s my fault he doesn\u2019t read books, is that it?</p><p>\u201cAnd what else did you talk about?\u201d I persist.</p><p>\u201cBecky, honestly. I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>His phone beeps with a text and he checks it. He smiles, texts something back, then resumes getting undressed. I\u2019m watching in growing disbelief and anger. How can he do that? In front of me?</p> <p>\u201cWas that in Latin?\u201d I say before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke wheels around, his hands still tugging at his shirtsleeves.</p><p>\u201cI just happened to see...\u201d I falter. Then I stop. Sod it. I\u2019m not going to pretend anymore. I take a deep breath and look at Luke straight-on. \u201cShe sends you texts in Latin, doesn\u2019t she? Is that your secret code?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Luke takes a step forward, his brow darkened. \u201cHave you been reading my texts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your wife! What does she text you about, Luke?\u201d My voice is rising in hurt. \u201cLatin books? Or...other things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d He looks bemused.</p> <p>\u201cYou know she\u2019s moving in on you, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke gives a short laugh. \u201cBecky, I know you have a vivid imagination, but really....\u201d He pulls his shirt off and dumpsit in the laundry hamper.</p><p>How can he be so dense? I thought he was supposed to be clever.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s after you!\u201d I\u2019m leaning forward in agitation. \u201cCan\u2019t you see it? She\u2019s a home-wrecker! That\u2019s what she does\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not after me!\u201d Luke says, cutting me off. \u201cTo be honest, Becky, I\u2019m shocked. I never thought of you as being possessive. Surely I\u2019m allowed to have a few friends, for Christ\u2019s sake. Just because she happens to be female\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d I cut him off scornfully.</p><p>It\u2019s that she used to be his ex-girlfriend and has long swishy red hair. But I\u2019m not going to say that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that...\u201d I flounder. \u201cIt\u2019s that...we\u2019re married, Luke. We should share everything. We shouldn\u2019t have anything separate. I\u2019m an open book! Look at my phone!\u201d I gesture widely. \u201cLook in my drawers! I don\u2019t have a single secret! Go on, look!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky, it\u2019s getting late.\u201d Luke rubs his face. \u201cCould we do this tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him indignantly. What does he mean, \u201cdo this tomorrow\u201d? We\u2019re not playing Monopoly \u2014 we\u2019re having a crucial discussion about the state of our marriage.</p><p>\u201cGo on! Look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Luke lifts his hands in surrender, and heads toward my bureau.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a single secret I\u2019m keeping from you! You can look anywhere, poke about all you like\u2014\u201d I draw up sharply.</p><p>Shit. The gender predictor test. It\u2019s in the top left drawer.</p><p>\u201cEr...except that drawer,\u201d I exclaim hastily. \u201cDon\u2019t touch the top left drawer.\u201d</p><p>Luke stops. \u201cI can\u2019t touch that drawer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s...a surprise. Or the Harrods bag on the chair,\u201d I add hastily. I don\u2019t want him seeing the receipt for my new hi-tech moisturizer. I nearly died myself when I saw the price.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Luke inquires.</p><p>\u201cUm...a couple of things in the wardrobe. Early birthday presents for you,\u201d I add defiantly.</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the bedroom. I can\u2019t quite tell what Luke is thinking. At last he turns, his face working oddly.</p><p>\u201cSo, our marriage is a completely honest, open book except for that drawer, this Harrods bag, and the back of the wardrobe?\u201d</p><p>I sense my position on the moral high ground is not quite as strong as I thought it was.</p><p>\u201cThe point is...\u201d I cast around. \u201cThe point is, I wasn\u2019t out all night with someone else, doing goodness knows what!\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I sound exactly like a whingy EastEnders wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Luke sighs and sits down on the bed. \u201cVenetia\u2019s not \u2018someone else.\u2019 She\u2019s a client. She\u2019s a friend. She\u2019d like to be your friend.\u201d</p><p>I turn away, pleating the duvet cover into a little fan.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t understand what your problem is. You were the one who wanted to go to Venetia in the first place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t exactly say, I didn\u2019t know then that she was a husband stealer.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be delivering our baby in a few weeks\u2019 time! You should be getting to know her. Feeling relaxed with her!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want her to deliver the baby flashes through my mind.</p><p>\u201cAnd on that subject...\u201d Luke stands up. \u201cVenetia asked if we could make an appointment tomorrow. She hasn\u2019t seen you for a while and she feels bad about it. I said we\u2019d both be there. OK?\u201d He heads into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say morosely, and sink back into the pillows with a great sigh. My head is swirling with confused thoughts. Maybe I am being unreasonable and paranoid. Maybe she\u2019s not after Luke.</p> <p>And she is the best obstetrician in the world, practically. OK. I\u2019m going to make a real, real effort and see if we can be friends.</p><p>When we arrive at the Holistic Birth Center on Friday, the paparazzi are out in force and I can see why. The Bond girl and the new face of Lanc\u00f4me are posing together on the steps, both in cool low-slung trousers and clingy tops which accentuate their teeny bumps.</p><p>\u201cBecky, slow down!\u201d Luke calls after me as I hurry to join them. But by the time I arrive, they\u2019ve already pushed their way in through the doors. I pause hopefully on the steps, but not a single lens points toward me. In fact, the photographers are all moving away, which is pretty insulting. You\u2019d think they\u2019d take a picture just to be polite.</p><p>Inside, the Bond girl is ahead of me at the desk, and I can hear the receptionist saying, \u201cAnd you got your invitation to tea at the Savoy? Do you need us to send a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d says the Bond girl, nodding at the Lanc\u00f4me model. \u201cZara and I are going together.\u201d</p><p>My heart skips a beat. Tea at the Savoy? I didn\u2019t get an invitation to tea at the Savoy. Maybe they\u2019re going to give it to me now! I approach the receptionist with an expectant smile, already reaching for my diary so I can check the date. But she doesn\u2019t hand over any invitation.</p> <p>\u201cTake a seat, Mrs. Brandon.\u201d She smiles back. \u201cVenetia will be with you shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...was there anything else?\u201d I linger at the desk. \u201cAnything I should...have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you bring a urine sample?\u201d The receptionist smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s all you need.\u201d</p><p>That is not what I was talking about. I wait another few seconds just in case, then stalk over to the seating area, trying to hide my disappointment. She hasn\u2019t invited me. All the celebrities will be having tea together, exchanging pregnancy stories and asking each other where they buy their premiere dresses, and I\u2019ll be sitting at home on my own.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Luke is regarding me, puzzled. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I can feel my bottom lip quivering. \u201cOnly she didn\u2019t invite me to the tea party. They\u2019re all going to the Savoy. All of them! Without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, you don\u2019t know there\u2019s a tea party. I\u2019m sure...I mean...\u201d Luke breaks off, clearly at a loss. \u201cLook, even if she didn\u2019t, does it matter? You don\u2019t go to a doctor because of the tea parties.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth, then close it again.</p> <p>\u201cBecky?\u201d A melodious voice rings out. \u201cLuke?\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. It\u2019s her.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen Venetia in weeks. To be honest, she\u2019d kind of altered in my mind. I\u2019d pictured her taller, with longer, witchier hair and flashing green eyes and kind of...fangs. But here she is, slim and pretty, dressed in a chic black turtleneck and smiling as though I\u2019m her best friend.</p><p>\u201cGreat to see you!\u201d She kisses me. \u201cI do apologize, I\u2019ve been neglecting you shamefully.\u201d As she says it, she glances at Luke as though they\u2019re in on some private conversation.</p><p>Or is that me being paranoid?</p><p>\u201cCome on through!\u201d She ushers us into her room and we all sit down. \u201cSo, Becky.\u201d Venetia opens her file. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby moving well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all the time.\u201d I put a hand on my tummy, and, of course, the baby\u2019s gone to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s have a feel.\u201d She gestures toward the examination table and I go and heave myself onto it while Venetia washes her hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid I hear something about a tea party out there, Ven?\u201d says Luke lightly. \u201cGreat publicity idea.\u201d I stare at him in astonishment and he winks.</p><p>Sometimes I really love Luke.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Venetia sounds taken aback. \u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s for patients at a slightly more advanced stage than you, Becky. But of course you\u2019re on the list for the next one!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s so lying. I wasn\u2019t on that list.</p> <p>As her hands move over my abdomen, I can\u2019t relax. I\u2019m staring at her hands: slim and white, with a massive diamond eternity band on the third finger of her right hand. I wonder who gave her that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good-size baby. Breech at the moment, which means the head is up near your ribs....\u201d Venetia\u2019s frowning in concentration as she feels the baby. \u201cIf it remains in that position we\u2019ll have to discuss your options for the birth, but it\u2019s early days yet.\u201d She glances at her notes. \u201cYou\u2019re only thirty-two weeks. Plenty of time for the baby to turn. Now, let\u2019s listen to the heartbeat....\u201d She squirts gel on my stomach, and does the ultrasound. A moment later the heartbeat is going wow-wow-wow through the room.</p><p>\u201cNice, strong heartbeat.\u201d Venetia nods at me, and I nod back as best I can while lying down. For a few moments the three of us just listen to the regular, fuzzy beat. It\u2019s so weird. Here we are, all transfixed by the sound \u2014 and the baby has no idea we\u2019re listening to it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your child.\u201d Venetia meets Luke\u2019s eyes. \u201cPretty amazing, huh?\u201d She leans over and straightens his tie \u2014 and I feel a spike of resentment. How dare she do that? This is our moment. And everyone knows that the wife straightens the tie.</p><p>\u201cSo, Venetia,\u201d I say politely as at last she turns off the ultrasound machine. \u201cI was sorry to hear about you splitting up with your boyfriend. What a shame.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh well.\u201d Venetia spreads her hands. \u201cSome things aren\u2019t meant to be.\u201d She smiles sweetly. \u201cHow\u2019s your general health, Becky? Any aches and pains? Heartburn? Hemorrhoids?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. She\u2019s deliberately choosing all the least sexy ailments.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cI feel really great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re lucky.\u201d Venetia gestures to us to sit down again. \u201cToward the end of pregnancy, you\u2019ll find your body will really start feeling the strain. You may suffer from acne...varicose veins.... Sex will obviously be difficult, if not impossible....\u201d</p><p>Ooh. She is an absolute cow.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any problems in that area.\u201d I take Luke\u2019s hand and clasp it. \u201cDo we, darling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s early days yet.\u201d Venetia\u2019s pleasant smile is unmoved. \u201cMany of my patients lose their libido for good after childbirth. And of course, unfortunately, some men find their partner\u2019s new shape somewhat...unattractive.\u201d</p><p>Unattractive? Did she just say I was unattractive?</p><p>She\u2019s wrapped a blood pressure cuff round my arm and now frowns as it deflates. \u201cYour blood pressure\u2019s creeping higher, Becky.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not bloody surprised! I glance at Luke, but he seems totally unsuspicious.</p><p>\u201cDarling, you should mention that pain in your leg,\u201d he says. \u201cRemember, the other evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain in the leg?\u201d Venetia looks up, alert.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cJust a twinge.\u201d</p><p>I wore my new five-inch Manolos all day at work last week. Which was maybe a mistake, as by the time I got home I could barely walk and had to get Luke to massage my calf muscle.</p> <p>\u201cYou should get it checked out, even so.\u201d Luke squeezes my hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no harm being careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Venetia pushes back her chair. \u201cLet\u2019s examine it, shall we, Becky? Up on the table again.\u201d</p><p>I do not like that glint in her eye. Reluctantly, I take off my new Wolford Stay-Ups and get on the table.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She takes my leg, peers at it, then rubs a hand over it. \u201cI think I can feel the beginnings of a varicose vein!\u201d</p><p>I stare at my smooth skin in horror. She\u2019s lying. There\u2019s not a hint of a varicose vein.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anything there,\u201d I say, trying to stay calm.</p><p>\u201cTo you it might seem invisible, but I can detect these things very early on.\u201d Venetia pats my shoulder. \u201cWhat I recommend, Becky, is you wear these surgical support stockings from now on.\u201d She takes a packet from her desk and pulls out a pair of what look like long white-mesh socks. \u201cPut them on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting those on!\u201d I recoil in horror.

Let me see what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p> <p>She surveys my new platform wedges and shakes her head sadly.</p><p>\u201cThose really aren\u2019t suitable for late pregnancy. Here, try these.\u201d She roots in her bottom desk drawer and produces a pair of ugly brown rubber flip-flops. \u201cThey\u2019re an orthopedic sample. I\u2019d be glad to know what you think of them.\u201d</p><p>I stare at them in dismay. \u201cInstead of the support stockings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d She smiles. \u201cI think you should wear the support stockings as well. Just to be on the safe side.\u201d</p><p>Bitch. Bitch.</p> <p>\u201cPut them on, darling,\u201d says Luke with an encouraging nod. \u201cVenetia\u2019s just thinking of your health.\u201d</p><p>No, she\u2019s not! I want to yell. Can\u2019t you see what she\u2019s doing?</p><p>But I can\u2019t. There\u2019s no way out. They\u2019re both watching me. I\u2019m going to have to do this.</p><p>Feeling sick, I slowly pull on first one surgical stocking, then the other.</p><p>\u201cTug them right up!\u201d says Venetia. \u201cThat\u2019s it, over your thighs.\u201d I slip on the horrible flip-flops. Then I pick up my new oversize Marc Jacobs (pale yellow, totally gorgeous) bag to stuff my wedges in.</p><p>\u201cIs that your bag?\u201d Venetia\u2019s beady eyes alight on it and I feel a clutch of dread. Not the bag. Please, not the bag.</p> <p>\u201cThis is far too heavy for a pregnant woman!\u201d she says, taking it from me and hefting it with a frown. \u201cDo you know the damage you might do to your spine?\u201d To Luke she adds, \u201cYou know, I did a year working very closely with a physical therapist. The injuries she saw, from people lugging around ridiculous-size bags!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig bags are in fashion,\u201d I say tightly.</p><p>\u201cFashion!\u201d Venetia gives her silvery laugh. \u201cFashion is bad for your health. Try this, Becky. My physical therapist supplies them.\u201d She opens a cupboard and produces a fanny pack made of khaki webbing. \u201cFar more ergonomic for the back. You can even hide it under your T-shirt for security....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d says Luke, taking my Marc Jacobs from Venetia and putting it on the floor where I can\u2019t reach it. \u201cVenetia, this is so kind of you.\u201d</p><p>Kind? He has no idea what\u2019s going on here. None.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Becky!\u201d Venetia is like a cat playing with a half-dead mouse, relishing its suffering. \u201cSee if it fits.\u201d</p><p>With trembling hands I pull up my T-shirt, fit the khaki belt around my belly, fasten the clasp, and allow my T-shirt to fall back down. As I turn I catch a glimpse of myself in the full-length mirror fitted to the back of the door.</p><p>I want to cry. I look like a grotesque monster. My legs are two white, bulbous tree trunks. My feet resemble a granny\u2019s. I have bumps in front and behind.</p> <p>\u201cYou look great, Becky!\u201d Venetia has hopped onto the desk and is doing an agile, yoga-type stretch which shows off her long, lithe arms. \u201cSo, Luke, that was a marvelous meeting we had. I was really interested in what you had to say about Web links....\u201d</p><p>Miserably, I shuffle to my seat and wait for them to finish talking about Venetia\u2019s business profile. But now they\u2019ve moved on to her brochure and whether it could be improved.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, Becky!\u201d Venetia suddenly appears to notice me. \u201cThis must be really boring. You know, the checkup\u2019s done, so if you don\u2019t want to hang around....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you meeting Suze and Jess for lunch?\u201d Luke looks at me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shoot off? I just want to recap a few things with Venetia.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m rooted to the ground. I don\u2019t want to leave him here alone with her. Every instinct is telling me not to. But if I say that, he\u2019ll think I\u2019m just being all possessive and suspicious and we\u2019ll have another huge row.</p><p>\u201cWell, OK,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you take what you need,\u201d says Venetia, gesturing at my Marc Jacobs. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to hear that you\u2019ve been using that bag!\u201d She wags her finger at me.</p><p>I want to shoot her. But there\u2019s no point arguing; Luke will only take her side. In silence I take out my purse, phone, keys, and a few essential items of makeup. I put them in the khaki bag and zip it shut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBye, darling.\u201d Luke kisses me. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye. Bye, Venetia.\u201d I can barely look her in the eye. I leave the room and head out to the foyer.</p><p>At the reception desk I can see an excited blond girl with the tiniest of bumps, saying, \u201cI\u2019m so thrilled to have a place with Venetia!\u201d</p><p>Yes, you are now, I think savagely. Until she makes you look like a freak in front of your husband.</p> <p>I\u2019m nearly at the door, when a sudden recollection stops me. Luke\u2019s mobile rang this morning while he was in the shower, and I answered it. Which was not because I am possessive and suspicious, but because...</p><p>Well, OK. I thought it might be Venetia. But it wasn\u2019t; it was John from Brandon Communications and I never told Luke to ring him. I\u2019d better let him know.</p><p>I retrace my steps through the waiting room, trying to ignore the curious stares of the blond girl and her husband. These bloody stockings are coming off as soon as I get outside.</p><p>A woman in a blue nurse-type uniform is ahead of me in the corridor, and as I\u2019m shuffling along she pauses at Venetia\u2019s door. She knocks twice, then opens the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry!\u201d I hear her say. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb...\u201d</p> <p>Disturb what? Disturb what?</p><p>My heart suddenly hammering, I hurry forward along the corridor, and just catch a glimpse through the doorway as the nurse retreats.</p><p>And I see them. Sitting together on the desk, talking in low, laughing voices. Venetia\u2019s arm is resting casually across Luke\u2019s shoulders. The other hand is entwined in his. They look happy and relaxed and intimate.</p><p>They look like a couple.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I get to the restaurant where I\u2019m meeting Suze and Jess. I\u2019m walking on autopilot, like a zombie. I want to throw up every time I think about it.</p><p>They were together. They were together.</p> <p>\u201cBex?\u201d</p><p>Somehow I\u2019ve pushed my way in through the glass doors and am standing in a total daze as waiters bustle around and people chatter. \u201cBex, are you OK?\u201d Suze is hurrying over to greet me. Her eyes drop in dismay to my white legs. \u201cWhat are you wearing? What\u2019s happened? Bex...can you speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...no. I need to sit down.\u201d I totter after her to a corner table where Jess is sitting.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d Jess looks aghast at my appearance. She quickly pushes out a chair for me and helps me sit down. \u201cAre you OK? Is it the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw them,\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke and Venetia. Together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether?\u201d Suze claps a hand to her mouth. \u201cTogether, doing...what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were sitting on a desk, talking.\u201d I can barely get the words out. \u201cShe had her arm on his shoulders. And he was holding her hand.\u201d I look up for a reaction. Both Suze and Jess look like they\u2019re waiting for more.</p><p>\u201cWere they...kissing?\u201d Suze ventures.</p><p>\u201cNo, they were laughing. They looked all happy. I just...I had to get out of there.\u201d I take a deep gulp of water. Suze and Jess exchange glances.</p><p>\u201cAnd...that\u2019s why you put on white tights?\u201d hazards Suze cautiously.</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not!\u201d I thrust down my glass, feeling the humiliation rise up again. \u201cIt was Venetia! She took away my shoes and my bag and she made me put these things on, just so I\u2019d look all gross in front of Luke.\u201d</p><p>Suze gasps. \u201cWhat a cow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t get them off.\u201d I\u2019m near tears by now. \u201cI\u2019m stuck with them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on! I\u2019ll help you!\u201d Suze puts down her glass and reaches for one of the stockings. Jess is watching, her brow wrinkled.</p><p>\u201cBecky...are you sure there isn\u2019t some good health reason for wearing them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! She was just doing it to be mean! She said fashion\u2019s bad for the health!\u201d</p><p>Jess looks unmoved. \u201cFashion is bad for the health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFashion is not bad for the health!\u201d I erupt. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the health! It makes you...it makes you stay slim and stand up straight so your jacket hangs better. And take an interest in yourself so you don\u2019t get all depressed.\u201d I\u2019m ticking the points off on my fingers. \u201cAnd high heels are brilliant exercise for calf muscles....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, have some wine,\u201d says Suze soothingly, pushing her glass over. \u201cJust a sip won\u2019t hurt the baby. And it might...calm you down a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Thanks.\u201d I take a grateful gulp.</p><p>\u201cMy obstetrician told me I could have a glass every other night,\u201d adds Suze. \u201cHe\u2019s French.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take another sip, feeling my heart rate subside. I should have gone to France to have the baby. Or anywhere but Venetia Carter. Maybe I should just forget this whole hospital thing and have the baby in a shop, like I always planned. At least I\u2019d feel relaxed and happy. At least I\u2019d get free clothes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I put the wineglass down and look miserably from Suze to Jess. \u201cI\u2019ve already tried talking to Luke. He said nothing was going on and they were just friends. But they didn\u2019t look like just friends to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow exactly was he holding her hand?\u201d Suze frowns intently. \u201cCould it just have been friendly? Is Venetia a touchy-feely person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...\u201d I think back. I remember her squeezing my arm, brushing a hand down my arm. \u201cQuite,\u201d I allow at last.</p> <p>\u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s all it is! Maybe she\u2019s just one of those people that gets too close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any other evidence?\u201d asks Jess.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I fiddle with a bread stick wrapper, wondering whether to tell them. \u201cI followed him the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Suze looks aghast. \u201cWhat if he\u2019d seen you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did see me. I pretended I was shopping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBex...\u201d Suze clutches her hair. \u201cWhat if nothing\u2019s going on? Just seeing them holding hands isn\u2019t proof. You don\u2019t want to ruin all the trust between you and Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what should I do?\u201d I look from face to face. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d says Suze firmly. \u201cBex, I know Luke loves you. And he hasn\u2019t done anything really incriminating, has he? It would be different if he\u2019d lied to you, or if you\u2019d seen them kissing....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Jess nods vigorously. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got the wrong end of the stick, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I trail off, winding the wrapper tightly around my fingers. I don\u2019t know how to explain it; I just have a bad feeling. It\u2019s not just the texting, or the dinners. It\u2019s not even seeing them just now. It\u2019s something about her. It\u2019s something in her eyes. She\u2019s a predator.</p><p>But if I say that to the others, they\u2019ll say I\u2019m imagining it.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s order,\u201d says Suze firmly, shoving a menu at me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a set menu,\u201d says Jess, putting a typed sheet on top of the \u00e0 la carte. \u201cIt\u2019s more economical, if we only have two courses and don\u2019t choose any of these ridiculous items with truffles.\u201d</p><p>I immediately want to retort that truffles are my favorite food and who cares how much they cost? But the trouble is, I kind of agree. I\u2019ve never got the whole thousand-pounds-for-a-truffle thing.</p><p>Oh God. Please don\u2019t say I\u2019m starting to agree with Jess.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can help me think of how to get my own back on Lulu,\u201d adds Suze, passing the bread basket.</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d I say, cheering up. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been asked to do a TV program,\u201d Suze says with disdain. \u201cOne of those makeover shows where she goes to the house of some crap mother and tells them how to cook healthily for their children. And she\u2019s asked me to be the first crap mother!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already put my name forward to the production company!\u201d Suze\u2019s voice rises in indignation. \u201cThey phoned me up and said was it true that I only fed my children canned food and that none of them could speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a nerve!\u201d I take a roll and spread some butter on it. There\u2019s nothing like having someone else to hate, to make you forget your problems.</p><p>We have a great lunch, the three of us, and by the end of it I feel so much better. We all decide Lulu is the absolute pits. (Jess has never met Lulu, but I give her a pretty good description.) And then Jess relays her own problems. She told Tom about Chile and it didn\u2019t go too well.</p><p>\u201cFirst he thought I was joking,\u201d she says, crumbling a roll into little bits. \u201cThen he thought I was testing his love. So he proposed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe proposed?\u201d I say in an excited squeak.</p><p>\u201cObviously, I told him to stop being so ridiculous,\u201d says Jess. \u201cAnd now...we\u2019re not really talking.\u201d She says it in a matter-of-fact way, but I can see the sadness in her eyes. \u201cJust one of those things.\u201d She takes a deep gulp of wine, which is really unlike Jess. I glance at Suze, who gives me an anxious frown.</p><p>\u201cJess, are you sure about Chile?\u201d I say tentatively. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nods. \u201cI have to go.

If he would just stop listening to his mother!\u201d Jess shakes her head in exasperation. \u201cJanice is in total hysterics. She keeps sending me pages which she\u2019s printed out from the Internet, saying Chile\u2019s a dangerous, unstable country riddled with disease and land mines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d I say fearfully.</p> <p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d says Jess. \u201cShe\u2019s talking absolute rubbish.\u201d She takes a sip of wine. \u201cThere\u2019s just a few land mines, that\u2019s all. And a small cholera problem.\u201d</p><p>A few land mines? Cholera?</p><p>\u201cJess, be really careful out there,\u201d I say on impulse, and grab her hand. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, be careful,\u201d chimes in Suze.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Jess\u2019s neck flushes pink. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Thanks, anyway.\u201d As the waiter arrives with our coffees she withdraws her hand, looking awkward. \u201cI. like your hair clip, Becky.\u201d</p> <p>She obviously wants to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d I touch it fondly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it fab? It\u2019s Miu Miu. Actually, it\u2019s part of the baby\u2019s trust fund portfolio.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence and I look up to see both Suze and Jess staring at me.</p><p>\u201cBex, how can a Miu Miu hair clip be part of a trust fund portfolio?\u201d says Suze uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s an Antique of the Future!\u201d I say with a flourish.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an Antique of the Future?\u201d Suze looks puzzled.</p> <p>Ha. You see. I am so ahead of the game!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this fab new way to invest,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt\u2019s easy-peasy! You just buy anything and keep the packaging, and then in fifty years you auction it and make a fortune!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Suze, looking dubious. \u201cSo, what else have you bought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I think. \u201cQuite a few things from Miu Miu, actually. And some Harry Potter figures and Barbie princess dolls...and this fab bracelet from Topshop...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, a Topshop bracelet isn\u2019t an investment,\u201d says Jess, looking incredulous.</p><p>She really hasn\u2019t got the point.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not now,\u201d I explain patiently. \u201cBut it will be. It\u2019ll be on the Antiques Road Show \u2014 you\u2019ll see!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, what\u2019s wrong with a bank?\u201d says Suze anxiously.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting the baby\u2019s money into some crappy bank like everyone else!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m a financial professional, remember, Suze. This is what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you used to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like riding a bike,\u201d I assure her loftily. I\u2019m not actually that great at riding a bike, but I needn\u2019t mention that.</p><p>\u201cSo, is that it?\u201d asks Jess. \u201cHave you invested all the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019ve still got loads!\u201d I take a sip of coffee, then notice an abstract painting on the wall next to me. It\u2019s just a big blue square of oil paint on canvas, and there\u2019s a little price tag of \u00a3195. \u201cHey, look at that!\u201d I say, focusing on it with interest. \u201cD\u2019you think I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d chime Jess and Suze in unison.</p><p>Honestly. They didn\u2019t even know what I was going to say.</p><p>I arrive home that evening to find a dark, empty flat and no Luke. He\u2019s with her immediately shoots through my mind.</p><p>No. He\u2019s not. Stop it. I make myself a sandwich, kick off my shoes, and curl up on the sofa with the remote. As I\u2019m flicking down the channels looking for Birth Stories, which I\u2019m addicted to (only I have to watch the crucial bit through my fingers), the phone rings.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d It\u2019s Luke, sounding hurried. \u201cBecky, I forgot to remind you \u2014 I\u2019m out at the Finance Awards. I\u2019ll be back late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Now I remember \u2014 I did know about the Finance Awards. In fact, Luke invited me, but I couldn\u2019t face an evening of boring old fund managers. \u201cOK. I\u2019ll see you then. Luke...\u201d</p><p>I break off, my heart thumping. I don\u2019t know what I want to say, let alone how to say it.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d Luke hasn\u2019t even noticed my troubled silence. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke...\u201d I try again, but the line\u2019s already dead.</p><p>I stare into space for a while, imagining the perfect conversation in which Luke asked me what was wrong and I said, Oh nothing, and he said, Yes there is, and it ended with him saying he totally loved me and Venetia was really ugly and how about we fly to Paris tomorrow? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A blaring theme song from the TV drags me from my daze and I look up at the screen.

I\u2019m just trying to remember the number for the Living Channel, when my attention is drawn to the screen by a portly guy in a dinner jacket. I recognize him. It\u2019s Alan Proctor from Foreland Investments. And there\u2019s that girl Jill from Portfolio Management, sitting next to him. What on earth...</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it.

The camera pans around the ballroom and I scan the screen intently, looking at all the black-tied people sitting at tables. There\u2019s Philip, my old editor at Successful Saving, swigging back the wine. And that girl from Lloyds who always used to wear the same green suit to press conferences...</p> <p>\u201cHi, Becky,\u201d Luke answers abruptly. \u201cIs everything OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say. \u201cI just wondered how it\u2019s going at the Finance Awards?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m waiting for the camera to pan to Luke.

There isn\u2019t an empty chair at the whole table.</p><p>Luke lied to me. He\u2019s somewhere else. With someone else.</p><p>The glitzy light and noise of the awards ceremony is jarring my nerves, and I jab the TV off. For a moment I just stare blankly, in silence \u2014 then, in a daze, I reach for the phone and find myself dialing Mum\u2019s number. I need to talk to someone.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d As soon as I hear her safe, familiar voice, I want to burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cMum, it\u2019s Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky! How are you, love? How\u2019s the baby? Kicking away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s fine.\u201d I touch my bump automatically. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got...a...a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of problem?\u201d Mum sounds perturbed. \u201cBecky, it\u2019s not those people from MasterCard again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s...personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...it\u2019s...\u201d I bite my lip, suddenly wishing I\u2019d thought before phoning. I can\u2019t tell Mum what\u2019s wrong. I can\u2019t get her all worried. Not after she warned me about exactly this happening.</p><p>Maybe I can ask her advice without giving away the truth. Like when people write to advice columnists about their \u201cfriend\u201d and it was really them who got caught wearing their wife\u2019s swimwear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a...a colleague at work,\u201d I begin, my voice faltering. \u201cI think she\u2019s planning to...to move to a different department. She\u2019s been talking to them behind my back and having lunches with them, and I\u2019ve just found out she\u2019s lied to me....\u201d A teartrickles down my cheek. \u201cDo you have any advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ve got some advice!\u201d says Mum cheerfully. \u201cLove, she\u2019s only a colleague! They come and go. You\u2019ll have forgotten all about her in a few weeks\u2019 time and moved on to someone else!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say after a pause.</p><p>To be honest, that wasn\u2019t the hugest help.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Mum is saying. \u201cHave you got a diaper holder yet? Because I saw a super one in John Lewis\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Mum...\u201d I make another attempt. \u201cThe thing is, I really like this colleague. And I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s seeing these other people behind my back....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, who is this friend?\u201d Mum sounds perplexed. \u201cHave you ever mentioned her before?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s just...someone I click with.

Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I snuffle, rubbing my face. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit...upsetting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this girl really that important to you?\u201d Mum is clearly baffled. I can hear Dad in the background, saying \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d and there\u2019s a rustling as Mum turns away from the phone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Becky,\u201d I can hear her saying, sotto voce. \u201cI think she\u2019s a bit hormonal, poor love....\u201d</p><p>Honestly, I am not hormonal. My husband is having an affair.</p> <p>\u201cBecky, now listen.\u201d Mum is back on the line. \u201cHave you talked to your friend about this? Have you asked her straight-out whether she\u2019s planning to move departments? Are you even sure you\u2019ve got your facts straight?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as I try to imagine confronting Luke when he comes home tonight. Calling him on his lie. What if he blusters and tries to pretend he was at the awards ceremony? What if he says he loves Venetia and he\u2019s leaving me for her?</p><p>Either way, I feel totally sick at the prospect.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cOh, Becky.\u201d Mum sighs. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been the best at facing up to things, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I scuff my foot on the carpet. \u201cI suppose I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re grown-up now, love,\u201d says Mum gently. \u201cYou have to confront your problems. You know what you have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I give a huge sigh, feeling some of the tension leave my body. \u201cThanks, Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take care, darling. Don\u2019t let yourself get upset. Dad sends his love too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you soon, Mum. Bye. And thanks.\u201d</p><p>I switch off the phone with a new resolve.

It\u2019s like Mum says, I need to get my facts straight. All I need is to find out the answer to one simple question: Is Luke having an affair with Venetia? Yes or no.</p><p>And if he is\u2014</p><p>My stomach spasms at the thought and I do a few quick shallow breaths. In. Out. In. Out. Ignore the pain. I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I come to it.</p> <p>I\u2019m standing in West Ruislip tube station, right at the end of the Central Line, consulting my little A \u2014 Z. I\u2019ve never been to this bit of northwest London before and I wouldn\u2019t really have thought of it being the kind of place where private detectives hang out. (But then, I suppose I was really picturing downtown Chicago in the 1940s.)</p><p>I head off down the main road, glancing at my reflection in a shop window as I pass. It took me ages to decide what to wear this morning, but in the end I went for a simple black print dress, vintage shoes, and oversize opaque sunglasses. Although it turns out that sunglasses are a crap disguise. If anyone I knew spotted me, they wouldn\u2019t think, \u201cThere\u2019s a mysterious woman in black,\u201d they\u2019d think, \u201cThere\u2019s Becky, wearing sunglasses and visiting a private detective.\u201d</p><p>Feeling nervous, I start walking faster. I can\u2019t quite believe I\u2019m actually doing this. It was all so easy. Like booking a pedicure. I phoned the number on the card that the taxi driver gave me, but unfortunately that particular detective was about to go off to the Costa del Sol. (For a golfing holiday, not to follow a crook.) So I looked up private detectives on the Internet \u2014 and it turns out there are zillions of them! In the end I chose one called Dave Sharpness, Private Eye (Matrimonial a Specialty), and we arranged an appointment and now here I am. In West Ruislip.</p><p>I turn into a side street and there\u2019s the building ahead of me. I survey it for a few moments. This really isn\u2019t how I\u2019d imagined it. I\u2019d envisioned a dingy office down some alleyway with a single lightbulb swinging in the window and maybe bullet holes in the door. But this is a well-kept low-rise block with venetian blinds and a little patch of grass outside with a notice saying Please Do Not Drop Litter.</p><p>Well. Private detectives don\u2019t have to be gritty, do they? I stuff the A \u2014 Z into my bag, head toward the entrance, and push open the glass doors. A pale woman with badly layered aubergine-dyed hair is sitting at a desk. She looks up from her paperback and I feel a sudden pang of humiliation. She must see people like me all the time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Dave Sharpness,\u201d I say, trying to keep my chin high.</p><p>\u201cOf course, dear.\u201d Her eyes descend to my bump expressionlessly. \u201cTake a seat.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on a brown foam chair and pick up a copy of Reader\u2019s Digest from the coffee table. A moment later, a door opens and I see a man in his late fifties or even early sixties approaching me. He\u2019s paunchy, with bright white hair sticking up from a tanned head, blue eyes, and a jowly double chin.</p><p>\u201cDave Sharpness,\u201d he says with a smoker\u2019s wheeze, and grips my hand. \u201cCome through, come through.\u201d</p><p>I follow him into a small office with venetian blinds and a mahogany desk. There\u2019s a bookshelf filled with legal-looking books, and a series of box files with names on them. I spot one with \u201cBrandon\u201d written on it. It\u2019s resting openly on the desk, and I feel a flicker of alarm. Is this what they call discreet? What if Luke came to West Ruislip for a business meeting and he walked past this window and saw it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, Mrs. Brandon.\u201d Dave Sharpness has squeezed himself behind his desk and is addressing me hoarsely. \u201cFirst, let me introduce myself. I had thirty years in the motor trade before turning to private investigation. Having had various painful experiences myself, I know all too well the trauma you are undergoing right now.\u201d He leans forward, his chins wobbling. \u201cBe assured, I am one hundred and fifty percent committed to providing results for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Fab.\u201d I swallow. \u201cUm...I was wondering. Could you not have my box file out on show, please? Anyone might see it on that shelf!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are dummies with false names, Mrs. Brandon,\u201d Dave Sharpness says, gesturing at the shelf. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. Your file will be safely concealed in our client secure storage facility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d I say, feeling a bit more reassured. \u201cClient secure storage facility\u201d sounds pretty good. Like some underground system with coded locks and infrared laser beams criss-crossing each other. \u201cSo...what does that consist of, exactly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a filing cabinet in the back office.\u201d He wipes his glowing face with a handkerchief. \u201cLocked every night by Wendy, our office manager. Now, to business.\u201d He pulls a pad of foolscap toward him. \u201cLet\u2019s start at the beginning. You have concerns about your husband. You think he\u2019s cheating on you.\u201d</p><p>I have a sudden urge to cry out \u201cNo! Luke would never cheat on me!\u201d and get up and run away.</p><p>But that would slightly defeat the point of coming here.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know,\u201d I force myself to say. \u201cMaybe. We\u2019ve been married for a year and everything seemed great. But there\u2019s this...woman. Venetia Carter. They had a relationship in the past, and now she\u2019s come to London. He\u2019s seeing a lot of her, and he\u2019s all distant and snappy with me, and they send texts to each other in this code, and last night he...\u201d I break off, breathing hard. \u201cAnyway, I just want to find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d says Dave Sharpness, scribbling. \u201cWhy should you have to put up with the uncertainty and pain anymore?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou want answers. Your instincts are telling you something\u2019s wrong, but you can\u2019t put your finger on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d God, he totally understands.</p><p>\u201cAll you want is photographic proof of the illicit affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...er...\u201d I\u2019m halted. I hadn\u2019t really thought about photographic proof. All I\u2019d thought about was getting a yes or no answer.</p><p>\u201cOr video.\u201d Dave Sharpness looks up. \u201cWe can put all the evidence on DVD for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDVD?\u201d I echo, shocked. Maybe I haven\u2019t thought this plan through. Am I really going to hire someone to tail Luke with a video camera? What if he found out?</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you just tell me if he\u2019s having an affair or not?\u201d I suggest. \u201cWithout taking any pictures or video?\u201d</p><p>Dave Sharpness raises his eyebrows. \u201cMrs. Brandon, believe me. When we uncover the proof, you\u2019re going to want to see it with your own eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean...if you discover any proof. I\u2019ve probably got it all wrong! It\u2019s probably all perfectly...\u201d I trail off at his expression.</p><p>\u201cFirst rule of matrimonial investigation,\u201d he says with a lugubrious smile. \u201cThe ladies very rarely get it wrong. Feminine intuition, you see.\u201d</p><p>This guy is an expert. He should know.</p><p>\u201cSo you think...\u201d I lick my suddenly dry lips. \u201cDo you really think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think,\u201d says Dave Sharpness with a small flourish. \u201cI discover. Whether it\u2019s one lady he\u2019s dallying with, or two, or a whole string of them, myself and my operatives will find out and furnish you with whatever proof you need.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dallying with a whole string of ladies!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cI know he isn\u2019t! It\u2019s just this one specific woman, Venetia Carter\u2014\u201d I stop as Dave Sharpness lifts a reproving finger.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find that out, shall we? Now, I\u2019ll need as much information as you can give me. All the women he knows \u2014 both his friends and yours. All the places he frequents, all his habits. I like to do a thorough job, Mrs. Brandon. I will produce a full dossier on your husband\u2019s life, plus background on any women or other persons deemed to be relevant. There is nothing you will not know by the end of my investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d I try to keep my patience. \u201cI know everything about Luke already. Except for this one tiny thing. He\u2019s my husband.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I had a pound for every lady who\u2019s said that to me...\u201d Dave Sharpness gives a hoarse chuckle. \u201cYou fill in the details.

I take it from him and flip the pages, feeling uneasy.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to...give you a photograph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of that. You just tell us about the women. Don\u2019t leave anyone out.

In my experience, if they\u2019ve got one little secret, they\u2019ve got a whole host of them.\u201d He hands me a pen. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. We\u2019ll soon let you know.\u201d</p><p>I write \u201cVenetia Carter\u201d at the top of the page, then stop.</p><p>What am I doing?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d I drop the pen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This just feels so weird. So wrong. To spy on my own husband!\u201d I push my chair back and stand up. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come. I shouldn\u2019t even be here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to make your decision today,\u201d Dave Sharpness says unperturbed, reaching for a packet of toffees. \u201cAll I will say is that of the customers who react like your good self...ninety percent are back within a week. They still go ahead with the investigation, only they\u2019ve lost a week. As a lady in your advanced condition...\u201d His gaze drops meaningfully to my stomach. \u201cWell, I\u2019d be cracking on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Slowly I sink back down into the chair. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t use the word spying,\u201d he adds, wrinkling his florid nose. \u201cNo one likes to think of themselves as spying on a loved one. We prefer the term distance observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistance observation.\u201d That does sound better.</p><p>I fiddle with my birthing stone, my mind spinning. Maybe he\u2019s got a point: if I walk away now, I\u2019ll only be back in a week. Maybe I should just sign on the dotted line straightaway.</p><p>\u201cBut what if my husband saw you?\u201d I say, looking up. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s totally innocent and he discovers I hired a detective? He\u2019ll never trust me again....\u201d</p> <p>Dave Sharpness holds up a hand. \u201cLet me reassure you. All of my operatives operate with the utmost caution and discretion. Either your husband is innocent \u2014 in which case, no harm done \u2014 or he\u2019s guilty, in which case you have the proof you need to take further action. To be perfectly honest, Mrs. Brandon, it\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s no way at all he could find out?\u201d I say, just to be totally sure.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Dave Sharpness chuckles again. \u201cMrs. Brandon, I\u2019m a professional.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, I never realized hiring a private investigator was such hard work. It takes me about forty minutes to write down all the information Dave Sharpness wants. Every time I try to explain that I\u2019m only interested in whether Luke\u2019s seeing Venetia, he holds up his hand and says, \u201cTake it from me, Mrs. Brandon, you\u2019ll be interested enough if we find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I say at last, shoving the pad of paper toward him. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Dave Sharpness takes it and runs a fingernail down all the names. \u201cWe\u2019ll get cracking on this lot. Meanwhile, we\u2019ll place your husband under what we call low-grade surveillance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say nervously. \u201cWhat does that involve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my highly skilled operatives will follow your husband for an initial period of two weeks, at which time we shall meet again. Any information gained in the meantime shall be communicated to you directly by myself. I shall require a deposit....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, feeling for my bag. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as a new customer\u201d\u2014he rifles in his drawer and produces a small flyer\u2014\u201cyou qualify for our special offer.\u201d</p><p>Special offer? He honestly thinks I\u2019m interested in some stupid special offer? My marriage is under threat here. In fact, I\u2019m pretty insulted he even mentioned it.</p><p>\u201cValid only today,\u201d Dave Sharpness continues. \u201cBuy one, get the second half-price. It\u2019s a unique opportunity for new customers. Shame to miss out on a bargain.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. In spite of myself I\u2019m feeling the teeniest, weeniest ripple of interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I give a reluctant shrug. \u201cYou get the second detective half off?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a card!\u201d Dave Sharpness wheezes with laughter. \u201cNo, you order a second investigation and you\u2019ll get it half-price.

Wrap up all your investigatory needs in one go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have any other investigatory needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d He raises his eyebrows. \u201cHave a good think, Mrs. Brandon. No other little mysteries you need to clear up? No missing persons you\u2019d like us to trace? The offer\u2019s valid only today. You\u2019ll regret it if you lose out.\u201d He hands me the flyer. \u201cYou\u2019ll see our full list of services here....\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to tell him I\u2019m not interested, then find myself closing it again.</p> <p>Perhaps I should just have a little think about this. I mean, it is a pretty good deal. And maybe there is something else I\u2019d like to find out about. My eyes run down the headings on the flyer. I could trace an old schoolchum...or track a vehicle by GPS satellite...or simply discover more about a friend or neighbor....</p><p>Oh my God. I have it!</p><p>I\u2019m not sure Dave really got the whole eyebrow thing. But I explained as fully as I could and drew him a picture and in the end he became quite enthusiastic. He said if he didn\u2019t find out where and how Jasmine was getting her eyebrows shaped, he wasn\u2019t Regional Salesman of the Year, 1989 (Southwest). I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s got to do with private detecting, but anyway. He\u2019s on the case. Both of them.</p><p>So it\u2019s done. The only thing is, I now feel horribly guilty.</p><p>The nearer I get to home the guiltier I feel, until I can\u2019t bear it anymore. I hurry into the shop at the end of our road and buy Luke a bunch of flowers and some chocolates, and at the last moment I throw in a miniature whisky.</p> <p>His car is in our parking space, which means he must be home. As I travel up in the lift I start getting my story straight. My plan is: I\u2019ll just say I was at work all afternoon.</p><p>No. He might have called there for some reason and found out I took the afternoon off.</p><p>I\u2019ll say I was shopping. Nowhere near West Ruislip.</p><p>But what if someone saw me in West Ruislip? What if one of Luke\u2019s employees lives in West Ruislip and she was working from home and rang Luke and said, \u201cGuess what, I\u2019ve just seen your wife!\u201d</p><p>OK, I was in West Ruislip. I was there for...another reason. To see a pregnancy hypnotherapist. Yes. Brilliant.</p><p>By now I\u2019ve reached our front door, and as I unlock it, my heart\u2019s thumping with nerves.</p> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d Luke appears in the hall, holding a huge bouquet, and I stare at him, transfixed. We both have flowers?</p><p>Oh God. He knows.</p><p>No. Don\u2019t be stupid. How could he know? And why would that make him buy flowers?</p><p>Luke seems a little puzzled too. \u201cThese are for you,\u201d he says after a pause.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say in a constricted voice. \u201cWell...these are for you.\u201d</p><p>Awkwardly we exchange bouquets, and I hand Luke his chocolates and miniature whisky.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go...\u201d Luke nods toward the kitchen, and I follow him to the area where we have a sofa and a low table. Late afternoon sunshine is blazing in through the window, and it almost feels like summer.</p><p>Luke sinks onto the sofa beside me and takes a swig from a bottle of beer on the table. \u201cBecky, I just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He rubs his brow, as though marshaling his thoughts. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been distant these past few days. It\u2019s been a strange time. But...I think I\u2019ve managed to get rid of something that was bothering me.\u201d</p> <p>He finally looks up, and I feel a dart of understanding. He\u2019s talking in subtext! It couldn\u2019t be clearer. Something that was bothering me. That\u2019s her. Venetia came on to him \u2014 and he rejected her. That\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to tell me! He turned her down!</p><p>And here I am, hiring private detectives, like I don\u2019t trust him. Like I don\u2019t love him.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019m sorry too!\u201d I say in a rush of remorse. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Luke looks taken aback.</p><p>\u201cFor...er...\u201d Do not blurt it all out, Becky. \u201cFor...that time I forgot to order the groceries. I\u2019ve always felt really bad about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Luke laughs and pulls me close for a kiss. For a while we just sit there, the sun warm on our faces. It\u2019s ages since we just sat like this. The baby is squirming energetically inside me, and we both watch as my dress jumps with the motion. It is pretty freaky, just like Suze said. But it\u2019s exciting too.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Luke, putting a hand on my stomach. \u201cWhen are we going to look at prams?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSoon!\u201d I put my arms round him and hug him tight in relief.

Repeat: CALL IT OFF. He is not having an affair after all.</p><p>I will contact you in due course about the deposit I paid you.</p><p>With best wishes,</p><p>Rebecca Brandon</p> <p>FACULTY OF CLASSICS</p><p>OXFORD UNIVERSITY</p><p>OXFORD OX1 6TH</p><p>Mrs R Brandon 37 Maida Vale Mansions Maida Vale</p><p>London NW6 0YF</p><p>11 November 2003</p> <p>Dear Mrs. Brandon,</p><p>I am delighted to enclose translations of the Latin text messages you sent me, and hope they put your mind at rest. They are all entirely innocuous: for instance, sum suci plena means \u201cI\u2019m full of life\u201d rather than the more graphic meaning you ascribed to it.</p><p>I also think you may have been unduly concerned by the phrases licitum dic, fac me, and sex, which in Latin means \u201csix.\u201d</p><p>If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to let me know. Perhaps some Latin lessons?</p><p>With very best wishes.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Edmund Fortescue</p><p>Professor of Classics</p> <p>THIRTEEN</p><p>THE WHOLE WORLD looks different when your husband isn\u2019t having an affair.</p><p>Suddenly a phone call is just a phone call. A text is just a text. A late night out isn\u2019t a reason to have a row. It even turns out fac me doesn\u2019t mean...what I thought it did.</p><p>Thank God I canceled the private detective, is all I can say. I even burned all his paperwork and receipts, so there was no chance of Luke finding out. (And then quickly invented a story about defective hair tongs when the smoke alarm went off.)</p><p>Luke is so much more relaxed these days, and he hasn\u2019t even mentioned her for two weeks. Except when an invitation came to a Cambridge reunion party and he said casually, \u201cOh yes, Ven told me about this.\u201d It\u2019s a black-tie dance at the Guildhall in London, and I\u2019m determined to look as fab and glam as I can, like Catherine Zeta-Jones at the Oscars. Yesterday I bought the best dress, all clingy and sexy in midnight-blue silk, and now I need some matching heels.(And Venetia can just choke on her chicken.)</p><p>So everything\u2019s going brilliantly. We\u2019re exchanging contracts on the house next week, and last night we talked about throwing a massive housewarming-christening party, which would be so cool. And the really big news is that Danny arrives today! He flies in this morning and is coming straight to the store to meet everyone and announce his collaboration with The Look. Then he and I are having lunch, just the two of us. I\u2019m so looking forward to it.</p><p>As I arrive at The Look at nine thirty, the place is already bustling with excitement. A reception area has been set up on the ground floor, with a table of champagne glasses and a big screen showing footage from Danny\u2019s latest catwalk show. A few journalists have arrived for the press conference, and all the PR department is milling around bright-eyed, handing out media packs.</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d Eric advances on me before I\u2019ve even taken my coat off. \u201cA word, please. Any news on the design?\u201d</p><p>This is the only teeny little hitch. Danny said he\u2019d submit a provisional design to us by last week. And he still hasn\u2019t. I spoke to him a couple of days ago, and he said it was pretty much there, he just needed the final inspiration. Which could mean anything. It probably means he hasn\u2019t even started. Not that I\u2019ll let Eric know this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the final stages,\u201d I say as convincingly as I can.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I cross my fingers behind my back.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s it like?\u201d His brows narrow. \u201cIs it a top? A dress? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...groundbreaking.\u201d I wave my hands vaguely. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of...You\u2019ll have to see it. When it\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Eric doesn\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>\u201cYour friend Mr. Kovitz has just made yet another request,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo tickets for Euro Disney.\u201d He gives me a baleful stare. \u201cWhy is he going to Euro Disney?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help cursing Danny inside. Why can\u2019t he buy his own bloody tickets to Euro Disney?</p><p>\u201cInspiration!\u201d I say at last. \u201cHe\u2019s probably going to make some satirical comment on...modern culture.\u201d</p><p>Eric doesn\u2019t look impressed.</p><p>\u201cRebecca, this plan of yours is costing a lot more time and money than I anticipated,\u201d he says heavily. \u201cMoney which could have gone into conventional marketing. It had better work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt will!

I just offered to resign. Why on earth did I do that? I\u2019m just wondering whether to run after Eric and say \u201cHa-ha, I was only joking!\u201d when my phone starts ringing and I flip it open. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky? Buffy.\u201d</p><p>I stifle a sigh. Buffy is one of Danny\u2019s assistants and she\u2019s been calling every evening, just to check some tiny detail or other.</p><p>\u201cHi, Buffy!\u201d I force a cheerful tone. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just wanted to check Mr. Kovitz\u2019s hotel room had been ordered as he wanted it? Eighty degrees, the TV tuned to MTV, three cans of Dr Pepper by the bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I ordered it all.\u201d Suddenly something occurs to me. \u201cBuffy, what time is it in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s four A.M.,\u201d she says brightly, and I stare at the phone, gobsmacked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got up at four A.M. just to check that Danny has Dr Pepper in his hotel room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s OK!\u201d She sounds totally breezy. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of working in the fashion industry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d comes a cry from the door. \u201cDanny Kovitz is here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBuffy, I have to go,\u201d I say hastily, and thrust my phone down. As I head toward the doors I glimpse a limo on the street outside and feel a prickle of excitement. It\u2019s amazing how important Danny has got!</p><p>Then the doors swing back, and there he is! He\u2019s as skinny as ever, and dressed in old jeans and the coolest black jacket, with one sleeve made out of mattress ticking. He looks tired and his curly hair is disheveled, but his blue eyes light up as he sees me, and he comes running forward.</p><p>\u201cBecky! Oh my God, look at you.\u201d He envelops me in an enormous hug. \u201cYou look fabulous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you!\u201d I retort. \u201cMr. Famous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon. I\u2019m not famous....\u201d Danny makes a two-second stab at being self-deprecating. \u201cWell...OK. Yes, I am. Isn\u2019t it wild?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help giggling. \u201cSo, is this your entourage?\u201d I nod at the woman in a headset who has come in alongside a huge, bald secret-service \u2014 type guy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my assistant, Carla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Buffy was your assistant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy second assistant,\u201d Danny explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Stan, my bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a bodyguard?\u201d I say in amazement. Even I didn\u2019t realize Danny had got quite that famous.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really need him,\u201d Danny admits. \u201cBut I thought it would be cool. Hey, did you get them to put Dr Pepper in my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree cans.\u201d I see Eric approaching and quickly steer Danny away, toward the champagne table. \u201cSo...how\u2019s the design coming?\u201d I ask casually. \u201cOnly I\u2019m getting some pressure from my boss....\u201d</p><p>A familiar defensive look comes over Danny\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it, OK?\u201d he says. \u201cMy team had some ideas but I\u2019m not happy with them. I need to soak up the feel of the shop...the vibe of London...maybe take inspiration from some other European cities....\u201d</p><p>Other European cities?</p><p>\u201cRight. And...how long do you think that will take? About?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me introduce myself,\u201d cuts in Eric, who has finally caught up with us. \u201cEric Wilmot. Head of marketing here at The Look. Welcome to Britain.\u201d He shakes Danny\u2019s hand with a grim smile. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be collaborating with such a talented young designer on such an exciting fashion project.\u201d</p><p>That sentence came word-for-word out of the press release. I know, because I wrote it.</p><p>\u201cDanny was just telling me how he\u2019s really close to coming up with a final design!\u201d I say to Eric, praying that Danny keeps his mouth closed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that exciting? Although no exact time scale yet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Kovitz?\u201d A girl of about twenty, wearing green boots and a very strange coat made out of what looks like cellophane, is shyly approaching. \u201cI\u2019m from Fashion Student Gazette. I just wanted to say I\u2019m a huge fan. We all are, in my year at Central Saint Martins. Could I ask you a few questions about your inspiration?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ha. You see? I shoot a triumphant look at Eric, who just scowls back.</p><p>It\u2019s pretty exciting, being part of a major fashion launch at a major department store! Even if it is a failing, empty department store.</p><p>Everybody gives a speech, even me. Brianna announces the initiative and thanks all the journalists for coming. Eric says again how excited we are to be working with Danny. I explain that I\u2019ve known Danny ever since he was first stocked at Barneys (I don\u2019t mention that all his Tshirts fell to bits and I nearly got the sack). Danny says how thrilled he is to be designer in residence at The Look, and how he\u2019s sure within six months this will be the only place to shop in London.</p><p>By the end, everyone\u2019s in a brilliant mood. Everyone except Eric.</p> <p>\u201cDesigner in residence?\u201d he says as soon as he gets me alone. \u201cWhat does that mean, \u2018designer in residence\u2019? Does he think we\u2019re putting him up all bloody year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say. \u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>I may have to have a little chat with Danny.</p><p>At last, after draining all the champagne, the fashion journalists melt away. Brianna and Eric disappear off to their offices and I\u2019m left alone with Danny. Or at least, with Danny and his people.</p><p>\u201cSo, shall we go for lunch?\u201d I suggest.</p> <p>\u201cSure!\u201d Danny says, and glances at Carla, who immediately speaks into her headset. \u201cTravis? Travis, it\u2019s Carla. Could you bring the car around, please?\u201d</p><p>Cool! We\u2019re going in the limo!</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s quite a nice place round the corner\u2014\u201d I begin, but Carla cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cBuffy has made reservations at three Zagat-recommended restaurants. Japanese, French, and I believe the third was Italian....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about...Moroccan?\u201d Danny says as the driver opens the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give Buffy a call,\u201d Carla says without batting an eyelid. She speed-dials as we all get into the limo. \u201cBuffy, Carla. Could you please hold the reservations you\u2019ve made and research a Moroccan restaurant for lunch? That\u2019s Moroccan,\u201d she repeats, enunciating clearly. \u201cLondon West One. Thanks, hon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel like a latte,\u201d says Danny suddenly. \u201cA mocha latte.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Carla speaks into her phone again. \u201cHello, Travis, this is Carla,\u201d she says. \u201cCould we please pull over at a Starbucks. That\u2019s Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>Thirty seconds later, the limo draws up beside a Starbucks. Carla opens the door.</p><p>\u201cJust a mocha latte?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Danny says, stretching out lazily.</p><p>\u201cAnything for you, Stan?\u201d Carla looks at the bodyguard, who is sunk in his seat, plugged into his iPod.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d He opens his eyes. \u201cOh, right, Starbucks. Get me a cappuccino. Real foamy.\u201d</p><p>The car door closes and I turn to Danny in disbelief. Does he have people running after him like this all day?</p> <p>\u201cDanny...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh?\u201d Danny looks up from flipping through Cosmo Girl. \u201cHey, are you cold in here? I feel cold.\u201d He switches on his phone and speed-dials. \u201cCarla, the car\u2019s a little cold. OK, thanks.\u201d</p><p>That does it.</p><p>\u201cDanny, this is ridiculous!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cCan\u2019t you talk to the driver yourself? Can\u2019t you get your own latte?\u201d</p><p>Danny looks genuinely perplexed.</p><p>\u201cWell...I could,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess.\u201d His phone rings and he switches it on. \u201cYes, cinnamon. Oh, that\u2019s too bad.\u201d He puts his hand over the phone. \u201cBuffy can\u2019t find a Moroccan restaurant for us. How about Lebanese fusion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny...\u201d I feel like I\u2019m on another planet. \u201cThere\u2019s a really nice restaurant right here.\u201d I gesture outside. \u201cCan\u2019t we just go there? The two of us, no one else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Danny seems to be getting his head round this idea. \u201cWell...sure. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>We get out of the car just as Carla approaches holding a Starbucks take-out tray.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d She surveys us in alarm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going for lunch,\u201d I say. \u201cJust Danny and me. In there.\u201d I point at the restaurant, which is called Annie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Carla nods vigorously, as though taking in the situation. \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll just make you a reservation....\u201d To my utter astonishment she speed-dials her phone again. \u201cHi, Buffy, could you please reserve a table at a restaurant called Annie\u2019s, let me spell that for you....\u201d</p><p>Buffy is in New York.

Which is a relief. I was going to have to admit defeat and call Buffy.</p><p>\u201cThis is so great, being here,\u201d Danny says, as a waiter pours him a glass of wine. \u201cHere\u2019s to you, Becky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to you!\u201d I clink his wineglass with my water glass. \u201cAnd here\u2019s to your fabulous design for The Look!\u201d I force myself to leave a natural pause. \u201cSo, you were going to tell me when you thought you might have something to show us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas I?\u201d Danny looks surprised. \u201cHey, you want to come to Paris with me next week? There is the best gay scene there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFab!\u201d I nod. \u201cThe thing is, Danny, we kind of...sort of...need to have something quite...quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuickly?\u201d Danny opens his eyes wide, looking betrayed. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018quickly\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know! As soon as you can manage, really. We\u2019re trying to save the store, so the sooner we can get something going, the better....\u201d I trail off as Danny fixes a reproachful gaze on me.</p><p>\u201cI could be \u2018quick,\u2019\u201d he says, uttering the word with disdain. \u201cI could throw together a few crap ideas in five minutes. Or I could do something meaningful. Which may take time. That\u2019s the creative process \u2014 excuse me for being an artist.\u201d He takes a gulp of wine and puts his glass down.</p> <p>I can\u2019t say that a few crap ideas in five minutes sound great to me.</p><p>Can I?</p><p>\u201cIs there a middle road?\u201d I venture at last. \u201cLike...some fairly good ideas in about...a week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week?\u201d Danny looks almost more offended than before.</p><p>\u201cOr...whatever.\u201d I back down. \u201cYou\u2019re the creative person; you know how you work best. So! What do you want to eat?\u201d</p><p>We order penne (me) and lobster (Danny) and the special quail\u2019s-egg salad (Danny) and a champagne cocktail (Danny).</p> <p>\u201cSo, how\u2019ve you been?\u201d Danny asks as the waiter eventually retreats. \u201cI\u2019ve been having a total nightmare with my boyfriend, Nathan. I thought he was seeing someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I confess.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Danny drops his roll in astonishment. \u201cYou thought Luke was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving an affair.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d He seems genuinely shocked. \u201cBut you guys are so perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine now,\u201d I reassure him. \u201cI know nothing\u2019s going on.

She\u2019s our obstetrician. And she\u2019s Luke\u2019s ex-girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh.\u201d Danny winces. \u201cThe ex-girlfriend. Harsh. And what\u2019s she like?\u201d</p><p>I have a sudden flashback to Venetia making me put on those revolting surgical stockings, her eyes gleaming with triumph.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a redhaired bitch and I hate her,\u201d I say, more vehemently than I meant to. \u201cI call her Cruella de Venetia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s delivering the baby?\u201d Danny starts laughing. \u201cIs this for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny!\u201d I can\u2019t help giggling too.</p><p>\u201cI have to see this birth.\u201d Danny skewers an olive on a cocktail stick. \u201c\u2018Push!\u2019 \u2018I won\u2019t, you bitch!\u2019 You should sell tickets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d My stomach\u2019s hurting from laughing. On the table my phone beeps with a text and I pull it over to have a look. \u201cHey, it\u2019s Luke! He\u2019s stopping by to say hello!\u201d I texted Luke while we were ordering, to let him know where we were having lunch.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Danny takes a swig of his champagne cocktail. \u201cSo, you guys are cool now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re great.

We\u2019re going to look at prams together tomorrow.\u201d I give Danny a beatific smile.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know you thought he was cheating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought it up a couple of times,\u201d I say slowly, buttering another roll. \u201cBut he always denied anything was going on.

Another little Becky Bloomwood. You better get back to the office, Luke, and earn some money. You\u2019re gonna need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I hit him on the arm. But Luke\u2019s already getting up from his seat. \u201cI was only passing, anyway. Iain\u2019s waiting for me in the car. See you again, Danny. Bye, sweetheart.\u201d He kisses me on the forehead, then peers out the restaurant window as though searching for something.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I say, following his gaze.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d Luke frowns. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything, but for the last few days I\u2019ve felt as though I\u2019m being followed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollowed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing the same guy around the place all the time.\u201d Luke shrugs. \u201cHe was outside the office yesterday, and I saw him just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who on earth\u2014\u201d I come to a halt.</p><p>Shit.

See you later.\u201d He touches my hand, and we both watch him wend his way between the tables.</p><p>\u201cTrust is a beautiful thing between a married couple,\u201d observes Danny. \u201cYou two are very lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I\u2019m scrabbling for my phone. \u201cI have to call them off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you already did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did!

I feel sure someone\u2019s watching us. But where? Hiding in the trees? Sitting in a parked car with a long lens trained on us? I edge down the steps of the building, my eyes darting from side to side. There\u2019s an electronic clicking sound to my left, and I instinctively shield my face with my hand \u2014 until I realize it\u2019s not a camera, it\u2019s someone opening their car.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, darling?\u201d Luke is watching me, bemused.</p> <p>The postman comes by, and I shoot a suspicious glance at him.

I told Luke all along. And a built-in fridge.</p><p>My mobile rings just as we reach the gates of our block, and I jump a mile. That timing is too coincidental. It\u2019ll be the private detective, telling me he\u2019s in the boot of the car. Or he\u2019s in the building opposite, with a sniper rifle aimed at Luke....</p><p>Stop it. I didn\u2019t hire an assassin. It\u2019s fine.</p> <p>Even so, as I get my phone out, my hands are trembling. \u201cEr...hello?\u201d I say nervously.</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s me!\u201d comes Suze\u2019s breezy voice, with the clamor of children\u2019s voices in the background. \u201cListen, if they have a twin Urban Baby cozy-toes in red trim, will you get it for me? I\u2019ll pay you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Er...of course.\u201d I grab a pen and scribble it down. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s it. I\u2019d better go! Talk later!\u201d</p><p>I put my phone away, still feeling jumpy. We\u2019re being followed \u2014 I just know we are.</p><p>\u201cSo, where is this place?\u201d Luke consults the leaflet and starts pressing buttons on his sat nav. The map pops up and he pulls a face. \u201cIt\u2019s bloody miles away. Do we have to go here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best place in London! Look!\u201d I read from the leaflet. \u201cYou get to try all the top-quality prams on a variety of terrains and a consultant will help guide you through the maze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe maze of pram-buying or a literal maze?\u201d inquires Luke.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admit, after searching through the leaflet. \u201cBut anyway, it\u2019s got the widest choice and Suze said we should go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Luke raises his eyebrows and does a U-turn. Then he frowns at the rearview mirror. \u201cThat car looks familiar.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Trying to appear casual, I swivel my head to see. It\u2019s a brown Ford and a guy is driving it. A dark-haired, pockmarked, private detective kind of guy.</p><p>Shit shit shit.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s listen to the radio!\u201d I say. I start tuning into different stations, turning the volume up, trying to distract him. \u201cAnd anyway, so what if it\u2019s familiar? There are lots of brown Fords in the world. Who knows how many? Probably...five million. No, ten...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrown Ford?\u201d Luke gives me a strange look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I turn my head again. The brown Ford has disappeared. Where did it go?</p><p>\u201cI meant that convertible BMW we passed,\u201d Luke says, turning the radio down. \u201cIt looked like Mel\u2019s husband\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say after a pause, and subside. Maybe I\u2019ll just keep my mouth shut for a bit.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t quite realized it would take an hour to get to Pram City. It\u2019s a warehouse based right out in North London, and there\u2019s a special park-and-ride scheme where you get on a bus. I didn\u2019t realize that, either. But still. It\u2019ll be worth it when we have the most cool uber-pram in the world!</p><p>As we descend the bus steps, I have a surreptitious scope around \u2014 but I can\u2019t see anyone who looks like a private investigator. It\u2019s mostly pregnant couples like us. Unless...maybe Dave Sharpness has hired another pregnant couple to trail us?</p><p>No. I\u2019m getting paranoid. I have to stop obsessing about this. Anyway, would it be the worst thing in the world if Luke found out? At least I care about our marriage. In a way, he should be flattered I\u2019m having him followed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Exactly.</p><p>We head toward the vast doors along with all the other couples, and as we enter, I can\u2019t help feeling a little glow of pleasure.

Where shall we start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Luke says, looking around. It\u2019s a big domed building, with vicious air-conditioning and nursery rhymes playing over the sound system. Colorful ten-foot banners hanging from the rafters read STROLLERS, ALL-TERRAINS, TRAVEL SYSTEMS, TWINS AND MORE.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do we need?\u201d Luke rubs his brow. \u201cA pram? A travel system? A buggy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends.\u201d I try to sound knowledgeable, but the truth is I\u2019m still foxed by this whole pram and pushchair business. Suze tried to explain the system to me, but it was just like going to press conferences when I was a financial journalist. I glazed over at the pros and cons of swiveling front wheels \u2014 and then when she finished I was too embarrassed to admit I hadn\u2019t taken in a word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done some research,\u201d I add, and reach in my bag for my Pram List, which I hand to Luke with pride. Over the last few weeks, every time I\u2019ve seen a cool pram or buggy, I\u2019ve written down its name \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t been easy. I had to chase one all the way down High Street Kensington.</p><p>Luke is leafing through the pages in disbelief. \u201cBecky, there\u2019s about thirty prams here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the long list! We just need to whittle it down a bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d We both look up to see a guy with a round head and close-cropped hair approaching us. He\u2019s wearing a short-sleeved shirt and a Pram City badge saying My Name Is Stuart, and he\u2019s propelling a purple buggy along with one expert hand.</p><p>\u201cWe need a pram,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Stuart\u2019s eyes drop to my stomach. \u201cCongratulations! Is this your first visit here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst and only,\u201d says Luke firmly. \u201cNot wishing to be rude, but we\u2019d like to get everything wrapped up in one visit, wouldn\u2019t we, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Glenda? Take care of this, please? Back to Section D.\u201d Stuart pushes the purple buggy across the shiny floor to a girl about ten yards away, then turns back to us. \u201cNow, what kind of a pram were you looking for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not quite sure,\u201d I say, glancing at Luke. \u201cI think we need some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Stuart nods. \u201cStep this way.\u201d</p><p>He leads us into the center of the Travel Systems area, then stops, like a museum guide.</p><p>\u201cEvery couple is different,\u201d he says in a singsong voice. \u201cEvery baby is unique. So before we go any further, I\u2019d like to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle, the better to steer your choice.\u201d He reaches for a small pad of paper which is attached to his belt by springy wire. \u201cLet\u2019s look at terrain. What will you be requiring of your vehicle? Pavement walking and shopping? Off-road hiking? Extreme mountaineering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them,\u201d I say, slightly mesmerized by his voice.</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d exclaims Luke. \u201cBecky, when do you ever go extreme mountaineering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might!\u201d I retort. \u201cI might take it up as a hobby!\u201d I have an image of myself lightly pushing a pram up the foothills of Everest while the baby goos happily up at me. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should rule anything out at this stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Stuart is scribbling some notes. \u201cNow, will you require the pram to fold down quickly and easily for car use? Will you want it to convert to a car seat? Will you be looking for something light and maneuverable or sturdy and secure?\u201d</p> <p>I glance at Luke. He looks as flummoxed as I feel.</p><p>Stuart relents. \u201cLet\u2019s look at some models. That\u2019ll get you started.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, my head is spinning. We\u2019ve looked at prams that turn into car seats, pushchairs that fold up with hydraulic action, buggies with bicycle wheels, prams with special-sprung German mattresses, and an amazing contraption that keeps the baby out of pollution and is \u201cideal for shopping and lattes.\u201d (I love that one.) We\u2019ve looked at foot muffs, raincovers, changing bags, and canopies.</p><p>To be honest, I\u2019m ready for a latte now myself, but Luke is still totally engrossed. He\u2019s poring over the framework of a pushchair with the hugest, most rugged wheels I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s upholstered in khaki camouflage and looks like a great big Action Man toy.</p><p>\u201cSo, it has an articulated chassis,\u201d he\u2019s saying with interest. \u201cHow does that affect the turning circle?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For God\u2019s sake. It\u2019s not a car.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t beat the turning circle on this model.\u201d Stuart\u2019s eyes are gleaming as he demonstrates. \u201cThe Warrior is the Humvee of off-roaders. You see the sprung axle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Warrior?\u201d I echo, aghast. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting a pram called the Warrior!\u201d</p><p>Both men ignore me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great piece of engineering.\u201d Luke takes hold of the handles. \u201cFeels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a man\u2019s pram. It\u2019s not a fashion pram.\u201d Stuart glances with slight disdain at the Lulu Guinness printed stroller I\u2019m holding on to. \u201cWe had an ex-SAS guy in here the other day, Mr. Brandon.\u201d He lowers his voice. \u201cThis is the pram he chose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it a lot.\u201d Luke\u2019s pushing it back and forth. \u201cBecky, I think we should get this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cThat can be your one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, my one?\u201d Luke stares at me.</p> <p>\u201cI want to get this one!\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cIt\u2019s got a limited edition Lulu Guinness print and built-in iPod holder. And look at the sun canopy. It\u2019s fab!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot be serious.\u201d Luke runs his eyes dismissively over it. \u201cIt looks like a toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your one looks like a tank! I\u2019m not pushing that down the street!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would just point out,\u201d interjects Stuart delicately, \u201cwhile applauding both your choices, that neither of these models has the car seat and lie-flat facilities that you were originally seeking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I look at the Lulu Guinness stroller. \u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I suggest you regroup, have coffee, and work out your needs? It may be that you need more than one vehicle. One for off-roading, one for nipping around the shops.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s a thought.</p><p>Stuart hurries off toward another couple, and Luke and I head toward the caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say as we reach the tables. \u201cYou go and get the coffees. I\u2019ll sit here and work out exactly what we need.\u201d</p><p>I pull out a chair, sit down, and get out a pen and my Pram List. On the back I write Pram Priorities and draw a grid. The only way to do this is to be totally rigorous and scientific.</p><p>A few minutes later, Luke approaches with a tray of drinks. \u201cGet any further?\u201d he asks, sitting down opposite me.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I look up, my face flushed from the effort. \u201cOK. I\u2019ve been working it out logically...and we need five prams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive?\u201d Luke nearly drops his coffee. \u201cBecky, one small baby cannot possibly need five prams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does! Look.\u201d I show him my grid. \u201cWe need a travel system with a carry-cot and a car seat for when it\u2019s tiny.\u201d I count off on my fingers. \u201cWe need an off-road jogger for going on walks. We need that shopping-and-lattes one for the city. We need the whizzy folding-up one for the car. And we need the Lulu Guinness one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...it\u2019s cool,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cAnd all the other yummy mummies will have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other yummy mummies?\u201d Luke gives me a blank look. Honestly. Doesn\u2019t he remember anything?</p><p>\u201cIn Vogue! I have to be the yummiest!\u201d</p><p>Stuart is passing the caf\u00e9 area, and Luke beckons him over.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. My wife is now talking about buying five prams. Please, can you explain to her that this is totally unreasonable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised, sir,\u201d says Stuart, giving me a confidential wink. \u201cWe do see a lot of repeat custom. And if you wanted to get all the pram-buying wrapped up in the one trip, it might make sense....\u201d He trails off at Luke\u2019s stony expression and clears his throat. \u201cWhy not try out a few models on our all-terrain stroller course? That\u2019ll give you a real idea.\u201d</p><p>The all-terrain stroller course is at the back of the store, and Stuart helps us take all our \u201cpossibles\u201d over to it.</p><p>\u201cWe at Pram City are very proud of our stroller course,\u201d he says, effortlessly pushing five buggies along in a straight line. \u201cAs you go around it, you\u2019ll find every surface that the pram may encounter in its lifetime, from the shiny marble of a shopping mall to the pebbly beach of a summer holiday to the stone steps of a cathedral.... Here we are!\u201d</p><p>Wow. I am quite impressed. The stroller course is about thirty meters long, like some kind of racetrack, and all the way round, people are pushing prams and calling out to each other. In the gravel section, one girl has got totally stuck with her pink umbrella buggy, and in the beach section, two toddlers are chucking sand at each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCool!\u201d I grab the shopping-and-lattes stroller and head for the start. \u201cRace you, Mr. Warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d Luke takes hold of the enormous khaki handles, then frowns. \u201cHow do I release the brake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Loser!\u201d I start dashing over the pavement section with my nippy stroller. A moment later I see Luke starting to push his monster along, and soon he\u2019s gaining on me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d I say over my shoulder, and pick up the pace.</p> <p>\u201cThe Warrior is invincible,\u201d Luke says in a film-trailer voice. \u201cThe Warrior admits no defeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan the Warrior do a twirl?\u201d I retort. We\u2019re on the marble surface by now, and my stroller is amazing! I push it with one finger and it practically does a figure eight. \u201cYou see? It\u2019s absolutely\u2014\u201d I look up to see Luke already on the gravel. \u201cYou missed your compulsory figures!\u201d I call in outrage. \u201cTwenty-second penalty!\u201d</p><p>The Warrior is pretty cool on gravel, it has to be said. It just kind of crunches the stones into submission. Whereas my stroller is a bit...crap.</p><p>\u201cNeed any help there?\u201d Luke inquires as he watches me pick my way across. \u201cHaving trouble with your inferior pram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to take the baby to any gravel pits,\u201d I retort kindly. I reach the grass and accidentally-on-purpose bump my pram into Luke\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cTrouble with your steering?\u201d He raises his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cJust testing your airbags,\u201d I say airily. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery kind of you. Shall I test yours?\u201d He bumps his pram into mine, and with a giggle I shove him back again. At the side fence I can see Stuart watching us in slight alarm.</p><p>\u201cAny decisions yet?\u201d he calls out.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Luke calls back, nodding. \u201cWe want three Warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I hit Luke with the back of my hand and he starts to laugh.</p> <p>\u201cMake that four\u2014\u201d He breaks off as his mobile rings. \u201cHang on a sec.\u201d He takes it out and lifts it to his ear. \u201cLuke Brandon. Oh, hi.\u201d</p><p>He lets go of the pram and turns away. Maybe I\u2019ll have a go with the Warrior now. I take hold of the massive handles and give it an experimental push.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d I hear Luke saying sharply. I wheel the Warrior round till I\u2019m facing him. His face is tight and pale, and he\u2019s listening with an intent frown to whoever\u2019s on the phone. Is everything OK? I mouth at him, but he immediately swivels away and takes several paces away from me.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I can just hear him saying. \u201cWe have to...think about this.\u201d He\u2019s rumpling his hair as he walks along the stroller course, not even noticing the couple with the three-wheeler who have to dodge him.</p><p>Feeling slightly anxious, I start following him with the Warrior. What\u2019s happened? Who\u2019s that on the phone? I bump the wheels down some steps, and at last I catch up with him at the sandy beach section. As I draw near I feel a nervous flip. He\u2019s standing still, clutching his phone, his face etched with tension.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an option,\u201d he keeps saying in the same low voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not an option.\u201d All of a sudden he notices me and his whole face jolts.</p><p>\u201cLuke...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking, Becky.\u201d He sounds rattled. \u201cCould I have some privacy, please?\u201d He strides off down the sand, and I gaze after him, feeling as though I\u2019ve been punched in the face.</p> <p>Privacy? From me?</p><p>My legs are trembling as I watch him striding away. What went wrong? One minute we were pushing prams and laughing and teasing each other and now...</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m aware of my own mobile ringing inside my bag. I have a sudden mad conviction it\u2019s Luke, apologizing \u2014 but I can see him on the other side of the stroller course, still talking.</p><p>I pull out my phone and switch it on. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brandon?\u201d comes a crackly voice. \u201cDave Sharpness here.\u201d</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake. Of all the times.</p><p>\u201cAt last!\u201d I snap, taking out my worry on him. \u201cListen, I canceled you! What are you doing, still following my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brandon.\u201d Dave Sharpness chuckles. \u201cIf I had a penny for every woman who phones up to cancel the next day and then regrets it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did want you to cancel!\u201d I feel like hitting the phone in frustration. \u201cMy husband knows someone\u2019s been following him! He saw one of your men!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Dave Sharpness sounds taken aback. \u201cNow, that should not have happened.

I\u2019m on the road to Liverpool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, stop the investigation!\u201d I say, as loudly and clearly as I dare.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about our findings? That\u2019s why I was ringing. Mrs. Brandon, I have a full report available for you....\u201d His voice disappears into a sea of static.</p><p>\u201cFindings?\u201d I stare at the phone, my heart suddenly thumping. \u201cWhat do you...Mr. Sharpness? Are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201c...really think you should see the photographs...\u201d</p><p>The crackle suddenly switches to a continuous tone. He\u2019s gone.</p><p>I\u2019m paralyzed, standing on the sand, one hand still clutching the Warrior. Photographs? He surely doesn\u2019t mean\u2014</p> <p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice startles me so much that I jump, flipping my phone into the air. He bends down to pick it up from the sand, and hands it back. I can\u2019t quite look at him as I take it with shaky hands and shove it in my pocket.</p><p>Photographs of what?</p><p>\u201cBecky, I have to go.\u201d Luke sounds as strained as I feel. \u201cThat was...Mel. Slight office emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I nod and start pushing the Warrior back to the beginning of the course. My eyes are fixed straight ahead. I feel numb. Photographs of what?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the Lulu Guinness pram,\u201d says Luke as we reach the start. \u201cI really don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Get the Warrior.\u201d I swallow, trying to press back the sudden lump springing up in my throat. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>All the fun and easyness has disappeared. I feel cold with apprehension. Dave Sharpness has got evidence of Luke doing...something. And I have no idea what.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>I DON\u2019T BOTHER with the sunglasses this time. Nor do I bother smiling at the receptionist. I sit bolt upright on the same brown foam chair, shredding a tissue to bits, thinking, I can\u2019t believe it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t do anything over the weekend. I had to wait until Luke went off to work this morning. I made sure he\u2019d really gone (by looking out the window and then calling him twice in the car to make sure he hadn\u2019t turned round) and then plucked up the courage to ring Dave Sharpness\u2019s office. Even then, I practically did it in a whisper. I spoke to the receptionist, who refused to give me any details of the findings over the phone. So here I am, at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, in West Ruislip again.</p><p>The whole thing feels surreal. It was supposed to be canceled. They weren\u2019t supposed to find anything.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brandon.\u201d I look up, feeling like a patient at a doctor\u2019s office. There\u2019s Dave Sharpness, sounding more sepulchral than ever. \u201cWould you like to come through?\u201d</p><p>As he ushers me into the office, he looks so pitying, I can\u2019t bear it. Instantly I decide to put on a brave face. I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m not bothered if Luke\u2019s having an affair. I was only wanting to know out of idle curiosity. In fact, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s having an affair, because I wanted a divorce all along. Yes.</p><p>\u201cSo you found something,\u201d I say nonchalantly as I take a seat. \u201cInteresting.\u201d I attempt a careless little smile.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a difficult time for you, Mrs. Brandon.\u201d Dave Sharpness leans heavily forward on his elbows.</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not!\u201d I say overbrightly. \u201cI really don\u2019t care. Actually, I\u2019ve got a boyfriend and we\u2019re going to run away together to Monaco, so I\u2019m absolutely fine about all of this.\u201d</p><p>Dave Sharpness doesn\u2019t look taken in.</p><p>\u201cI think you do care.\u201d His voice descends yet lower. \u201cI think you care very much.\u201d His bloodshot eyes are so mournful, I can\u2019t hold out anymore.</p><p>\u201cOK, I do care!\u201d I sniff. \u201cJust tell me, OK? Has he been seeing her?\u201d</p><p>Dave Sharpness opens a manila folder and surveys the contents, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThis part of the job is never easy.\u201d He sighs, shuffles the papers, then looks up. \u201cMrs. Brandon, your husband has been leading quite the double life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble life?\u201d I gape at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to say, he\u2019s not the man you thought he was.\u201d</p><p>How can Luke not be the man I thought he was? What\u2019s he talking about?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say, almost aggressively.</p><p>\u201cLast Wednesday, one of my operatives trailed your husband from his place of work.

There have been...regrettable incidents with women.\u201d Dave Sharpness looks at his notes with a distasteful expression. \u201cAll of which have been hushed up and paid off. He\u2019s clearly a powerful man, your husband.

But I also know my husband isn\u2019t a bully. Give me those notes!\u201d I grab the folder from him, and a pile of shiny black-and-white photographs falls out onto the desk.</p><p>I stare at them in confusion. They\u2019re all pictures of Iain Wheeler. Iain outside Brandon Communications. Iain Wheeler walking up the steps of a hotel.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my husband.\u201d I look up. \u201cThis is not my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere.\u201d Dave Sharpness nods in satisfaction. \u201cYour husband has two sides to his personality, as it were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, you stupid man!\u201d I shout, exasperated. \u201cIt\u2019s Iain! You\u2019ve followed the wrong person!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dave Sharpness sits up. \u201cLiterally the wrong person?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is one of his clients.

I grab it and point at Luke, who is in the background on the other side of the car, barely in focus. \u201cThat\u2019s Luke! That\u2019s my husband.\u201d</p><p>Dave Sharpness\u2019s breathing is getting heavier as he looks from Luke\u2019s blurry head to the photos of Iain, to his notes, and back to Luke.</p><p>\u201cLee! Get in here!\u201d he shouts, suddenly sounding far less smooth-caring-professional and more pissed-off-South-London-geezer.</p><p>A few moments later, the door opens and a skinny guy of about seventeen pokes his head round the door, holding a Game Boy.</p><p>\u201cEr...yeah?\u201d he says.</p> <p>This is the highly skilled operative?</p><p>\u201cLee, I\u2019ve had it with you.\u201d Dave Sharpness bangs his hand furiously on the table. \u201cThis is the second time you\u2019ve buggered up.

Yes, I\u2019ve a good mind to fire your bloody arse.\u201d Dave Sharpness\u2019s neck has turned bright pink. \u201cHow d\u2019you get the wrong man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno!\u201d says Lee defensively. \u201cI got his picture out of the paper.\u201d He reaches in the folder and pulls out a clipping from the Times.</p><p>I know this picture. It\u2019s a candid shot of Luke and Iain chatting at an Arcodas press conference. \u201cThere, see?\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt says, \u2018Luke Brandon, right, confers with Iain Wheeler, left.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey got the caption the wrong way round!\u201d I practically spit at him. \u201cThere was an apology the next day! Didn\u2019t you check it!\u201d</p><p>Lee\u2019s eyes have already drifted back to his Game Boy.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the lady!\u201d bellows Dave Sharpness. \u201cLee, you\u2019re a waste of bloody space!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Dad, it was a mistake, all right?\u201d whines Lee.</p><p>Dad?</p><p>This is the last time I ever get a private detective off the Internet.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brandon...\u201d Dave Sharpness is obviously trying to calm himself. \u201cI can only apologize. We will of course restart the investigation at no extra charge to yourself, this time focusing on the correct personage\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cut him off. \u201cJust stop, OK?

Oh, right.\u201d I come to a halt. I\u2019d forgotten about that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in here.\u201d Dave Sharpness takes the opportunity to press the manila folder into my arms. \u201cDetails of the therapist and the treatment, photographs, surveillance notes...\u201d</p><p>I want to throw the folder right back in his face and stalk out.</p><p>Only...Jasmine does have really good eyebrows.</p> <p>\u201cI might have a look just at that bit,\u201d I say at last, as stonily as I can.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll also find a few other pieces of information in there,\u201d Dave Sharpness says, hurrying after me to the door, \u201cthat had been collated in regard to your husband\u2019s case. Your friend Susan Cleath-Stuart, for example. Now, she\u2019s a very rich young lady.\u201d</p><p>I feel sick. He\u2019s been checking out Suze?</p><p>\u201cApparently, her fortune has been estimated at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I wheel round savagely. \u201cI never want to see or hear from you again! And if any of your firm follows Luke or any of my friends, I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Dave Sharpness, nodding as though this is a brilliant idea which he came up with. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p> <p>I totter to the end of the street and hail a taxi. It chugs off and I sit clinging to the handstrap, unable to relax until we\u2019re well out of West Ruislip. I can hardly bear to look at the manila folder sitting on my lap like a horrible guilty secret. Although now that I think about it, it\u2019s probably better that I brought it away. I\u2019m taking all this information and I\u2019m putting it straight in the shredder. And then I\u2019ll shred the shreds. I never want Luke to know what I did.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I even went down this road. Luke and I are married. We shouldn\u2019t spy on each other. It\u2019s practically in the marriage vows, \u201cTo love, to cherish, and never hire a private detective in West Ruislip.\u201d</p><p>We should trust each other. We should believe each other. On impulse I take out my mobile and dial Luke\u2019s number. \u201cHi, darling!\u201d I say as soon as I get through. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi! Is everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine. I was just wondering.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cThat phone call you took the other day, at the pram shop. You seemed a bit upset. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d He sounds truly remorseful. \u201cI really am. I...lost it for a moment. There\u2019s been a small problem here. But it\u2019ll work itself out, I\u2019m sure. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I exhale. I hadn\u2019t even realized I was holding my breath.</p><p>It\u2019s work. That\u2019s all it is. Luke always has little problems and blips that need sorting out, and sometimes he gets stressed. That\u2019s what happens when you run an enormous company.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, sweetheart. All set for the big night out?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the college reunion tonight. I\u2019d almost forgotten. \u201cCan\u2019t wait! Bye, Luke.\u201d</p><p>I put my phone away and take a few deep breaths. The main thing is, Luke has no idea I even went near a private detective. And he\u2019ll never find out.</p><p>As we reach the familiar terrain of West London I open up the folder and start leafing through the photos and surveillance notes. I might as well find out about Jasmine\u2019s eyebrows before I get to shredding. I come across a blurry shot of Suze walking down High Street Kensington, and I close my eyes, feeling another wave of shame. I\u2019ve made some terrible mistakes in my life, but this is the worst by a million zillion miles. How could I have exposed my best friend to some seedy private detective?</p><p>The next ten or so pictures are all of Venetia, and I pass over those quickly. I don\u2019t want to see her. Then there\u2019s a couple of Mel, Luke\u2019s assistant, coming out of the office...and then...Oh my God, is that Lulu?</p><p>I stare at the print, bewildered. Then I remember mentioning her when I was making the list of women that Luke knows. I said that Luke didn\u2019t get on with her, and Dave Sharpness nodded knowingly and said, \u201cThat\u2019s often the smokescreen.\u201d Stupid man. He obviously got the idea that Luke and Lulu were secretly having a torrid affair or something\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hang on.

He says coming to Britain gave him exactly the final inspiration he needed. Everyone\u2019s really excited. It\u2019s going to be a sell-out! I\u2019ve been texting my friends and they all want one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say in astonishment.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m more surprised by, Danny finishing his design so quickly or Jasmine coming to life.</p><p>\u201cIn here...\u201d She opens the heavy pale-wood door, and I can hear Danny\u2019s voice as we enter the boardroom. He\u2019s sitting on the long table, holding forth to Eric, Brianna, and all the marketing and PR personnel.</p><p>\u201cIt was just that final concept I needed to crack,\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cBut once I got it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so different!\u201d Brianna is saying. \u201cIt\u2019s so original.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Danny suddenly notices me. \u201cCome and see the design! Carla, come over here.\u201d</p><p>He beckons her over \u2014 and I gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d My voice shoots out in horror before I can stop it.</p><p>Carla\u2019s wearing a T-shirt with gathered seams and Danny\u2019s trademark ragged, pleated sleeves. The background is pale blue, and on the front there\u2019s a little stylized sixties-type drawing of a red-headed doll. Underneath is the single printed phrase:</p> <p>SHE\u2019S a REDHAiRED BiTCH and I HATE HER</p><p>I look at Danny and back at the T-shirt and back at Danny.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t....\u201d My mouth isn\u2019t working properly. \u201cDanny, you can\u2019t....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d says Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cThe magazines will love it.\u201d A girl from PR is nodding enthusiastically. \u201cWe\u2019ve already given InStyle a teeny sneak preview and it\u2019s going in their must-have column. And with the signature carrier bag too...Everyone is going to want one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a brilliant slogan!\u201d says someone else. \u201c\u2018She\u2019s a redhaired bitch and I hate her\u2019!\u201d</p><p>The whole room laughs. Except me. I\u2019m still in shock. What\u2019s Venetia going to say? What\u2019s Luke going to say?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have it on bus stops, on posters, in magazines....\u201d the PR girl is saying. \u201cDanny had a fab idea, which is to run it as a maternity T-shirt too.\u201d</p><p>My head jerks up in horror. He what?</p><p>\u201cGreat idea, Danny!\u201d I say, shooting daggers at him.</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d He beams back innocently. \u201cHey, you could wear one for the birth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, where did you get your inspiration, Mr. Kovitz?\u201d asks an eager young marketing assistant.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the redhaired bitch?\u201d The PR girl chimes in with an easy laugh. \u201cI hope she won\u2019t mind having a thousand Tshirts printed about her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Becky?\u201d Danny wickedly raises his eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cDoes Becky know her?\u201d says Brianna in surprise. \u201cIs this a real person?\u201d</p><p>Everyone suddenly looks interested.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I gabble in alarm. \u201cNo!

Pick your own bitch.\u201d He suddenly gives a huge, catlike yawn. \u201cIs there any more coffee?\u201d</p><p>Thank God. Disaster averted. I\u2019ll take a blond version home and Luke will never know about the original.</p><p>\u201cWe need this!\u201d says Carla, pouring out the coffee. \u201cWe were up all night. Danny finalized the design at around two A.M. Then we found an all-night silk screener in Hoxton, and they made up the prototypes for us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, we appreciate your efforts,\u201d says Eric ponderously. \u201cOn behalf of The Look, I would like to thank you, Danny, and your team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGratitude accepted,\u201d says Danny charmingly. \u201cAnd I would like to thank Becky Bloomwood, whose brainchild this collaboration was.\u201d He starts applauding, and reluctantly I smile back. You can never stay cross with Danny for long. \u201cTo Becky, my muse,\u201d Danny adds, lifting the fresh cup of coffee that Carla has poured for him. \u201cAnd the little musette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I lift my cup back toward him. \u201cTo you, Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his muse?\u201d Jasmine breathes beside me. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I shrug nonchalantly. But inside I\u2019m pretty chuffed. I have always wanted to be a fashion designer\u2019s muse!</p> <p>It just shows. Whenever life seems total rubbish, it always turns around. Today has been approximately a million times better than I expected. Luke isn\u2019t leading a double life after all. Danny\u2019s design is going to be a sell-out. And I\u2019m a muse!</p><p>By the end of the day I\u2019ve changed my clothes a few times, because fashion muses do like to experiment with their looks. I finally decide on a pink chiffon empire-line dress which I can just squeeze over my bump, with one of Danny\u2019s prototype Tshirts layered on top, together with a green velvet coat and a black feather hat.</p><p>I must start wearing more hats if I\u2019m going to be a muse. And brooches.</p><p>At five thirty Danny appears at the entrance to personal shopping and I look up in surprise. \u201cAre you still here? Where\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...just hanging out in menswear,\u201d he says casually. \u201cThat guy Tristan who works there...he\u2019s pretty cute, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTristan\u2019s not gay.\u201d I give Danny a look.</p> <p>\u201cYet,\u201d Danny says, and picks up a pink evening dress from our Cruisewear department. \u201cThis is gross. Becky, you should not be stocking this dress.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s totally hyper at the moment, the way he always gets when he\u2019s finished a design. I remember this from New York.</p><p>\u201cWhere are all your \u2018people\u2019?\u201d I ask, rolling my eyes. But Danny doesn\u2019t even get the irony.</p><p>\u201cDrawing up contracts,\u201d he says vaguely. \u201cAnd Stan took the car to go sightseeing. He\u2019s never been to London before. Hey, shall we have a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go home.\u201d I glance reluctantly at my watch. \u201cI have this reunion thing tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a quick drink?\u201d Danny wheedles. \u201cI\u2019ve barely seen you. Hey, what\u2019s with the hat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d I touch it, a little self-conscious. \u201cI just felt like feathers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeathers.\u201d Danny\u2019s surveying me with an interested frown. \u201cGreat idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I glow with pride. Maybe he\u2019ll base his whole new collection on feathers, and it\u2019ll be my idea! \u201cHey, if you want to draw a little sketch of me or anything...\u201d I say casually, but Danny isn\u2019t listening. He\u2019s walking around me, an interested frown on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou should wear a feather boa,\u201d he says suddenly. \u201cLike, an oversize one. Like...huge.\u201d</p><p>An oversize feather boa. That\u2019s so brilliant. It could be the next big thing! It could be the new Fendi baguette!</p><p>\u201cThere are feather boas in accessories!\u201d I say. \u201cCome on!\u201d I grab my bag and zip it up, first making sure the manila folder is safely in there. I\u2019m going to shred it as soon as I get home. When Luke isn\u2019t looking.</p><p>We head down the escalators to the ground floor, where the accessories department is located.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re closing....\u201d begins Jane, the accessories manager, but then she sees it\u2019s us.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say breathlessly as Danny heads to a stand displaying feather boas and scarves. \u201cWe won\u2019t be long. It\u2019s just we\u2019re having a key fashion moment here....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d says Danny, garlanding me with colorful feather boas. \u201cLike, the biggest feather boa you ever saw.\u201d He\u2019s tying eight boas together into a massive sausage-shaped one. \u201cThis is a great look.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel a frisson as he drapes the boa round me.

Celebrities will wear them to the Oscars, high street shops will rip them off....</p><p>\u201cThe Giant Boa,\u201d Danny says as he ties back a stray feathery strand. \u201cThe Giant. It\u2019s fabulous. Take a look!\u201d He swivels me round to face the mirror, and I gasp.</p><p>\u201cEr...wow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He beams at me.</p> <p>To be absolutely truthful, I gasped because I look so stupid. You can hardly see my head for feathers. I look like an enormous, pregnant feather duster.</p><p>But I mustn\u2019t be narrow-minded. This is fashion. People probably thought skinny jeans looked ridiculous when they first saw them.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d I breathe, trying to get the feathers out of my mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius, Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and have that drink.\u201d Danny is flushed with animation. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood for martinis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you put these boas on my account?\u201d I say to Jane. \u201cThere\u2019s eight of them. Thanks!\u201d</p> <p>We head out of the shop on a total high, and I lead Danny round the corner into Portman Square. The street lamps are on, and some people in black tie are coming out of the Templeton Hotel. They eye me weirdly as we pass and I hear a couple of giggles, but I just hold my head higher. If you\u2019re going to be at the cutting edge of fashion, you\u2019re going to get a few strange looks.</p><p>\u201cShall we go to the bar here?\u201d I suggest, coming to a halt. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit dull, but it\u2019s right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as they can mix a drink...\u201d Danny pushes open the heavy glass doors and ushers me in. The Templeton Bar is a very beige bar: beige carpet, plushy chairs and waiters in beige uniforms. It\u2019s crowded with business types, but I can see some space by the piano.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s nab that table over there,\u201d I say to Danny \u2014 and then I stop dead.</p><p>It\u2019s Venetia. Sitting in the corner a few yards away, her hair glowing under the lights, with a suited guy and another smart woman. I don\u2019t recognize either of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Danny peers at me. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d I swallow and jerk my head discreetly toward her. Danny follows my gaze and gasps theatrically in delight.</p><p>\u201cIs that Cruella de Venetia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I squeak.</p><p>But it\u2019s too late: Venetia\u2019s turned. She\u2019s seen us. She\u2019s getting up and coming across, an impossibly elegant figure in a black trouser suit and heels, her hair as immaculate as ever, a wineglass in her hand.</p><p>It\u2019s fine, I tell myself. Calm down. I don\u2019t know why my heart is pounding and my fingers are sweaty.</p><p>Oh. Well...maybe because in my bag is a folder containing ten long-lens pictures of Venetia. But she doesn\u2019t know that, does she?</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d She smiles and kisses me on both cheeks. \u201cMy favorite client. How are you? Only four weeks to go now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. So...um...how are you, Venetia?\u201d My voice is jerky and my face has turned red \u2014 but other than that I think I\u2019m acting quite naturally. \u201cThis is my friend, Danny Kovitz.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDanny Kovitz.\u201d Her eyes light up in recognition. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor.

A beaded jacket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the one!\u201d says Danny eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you look fabulous in it.\u201d</p><p>Why\u2019s he being nice to her? He\u2019s supposed to be on my side.</p><p>\u201cDid you buy the pants?\u201d he\u2019s saying now. \u201cBecause we did them in two styles, a capri and a boot cut. You\u2019d look great in the capri pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just bought the jacket.\u201d She smiles at him, then glances at me. \u201cBecky, you seem hot in all those...feathers. Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...fine!\u201d I blow a couple of feathers off my lipstick. \u201cThis is Danny\u2019s new fashion concept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Venetia gives my giant feather boa a dubious look. \u201cOnly, you know, it\u2019s not healthy for you to overheat during pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Typical. Bossing me about again. Telling me fashion\u2019s unhealthy. But the truth is, I am starting to sweat in all these layers, so reluctantly I unpeel the boa and take off my coat.</p><p>There\u2019s a weird silence. For a moment I\u2019m not quite sure why Venetia is staring at my chest. Then my stomach plunges as I realize I\u2019m wearing Danny\u2019s T-shirt. I glance down, and there it is, clear as day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>SHE\u2019S a REDHAiRED BiTCH and I HATE HER</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m quite cold!\u201d I clamp the boa round my neck again, trying desperately to cover up the words. \u201cBrrrrr! It\u2019s freezing in here. Isn\u2019t it freezing, for the time of year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that say?\u201d Venetia says in a peculiar voice. \u201cOn your T-shirt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I say, flustered. \u201cNothing! It\u2019s just a...joke! I mean, obviously it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s another redhaired bitch. Er...woman. Person.\u201d</p><p>This is not going well.</p><p>\u201cGood work, Becky,\u201d says Danny in my ear. \u201cTactful.\u201d</p><p>Venetia is inhaling deeply, as though trying to control herself. She looks pretty annoyed, now I come to notice it.</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d she says at last. \u201cMight we have a little talk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTalk?\u201d I echo nervously.</p><p>\u201cYes, talk. The two of us. Speaking to each other alone. If you wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d She glances at Danny.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll get us some drinks.\u201d He disappears off to the bar and I feel a quailing inside as I turn to face Venetia. There\u2019s a frown line between her eyes and she\u2019s tapping her fingers against the stem of her glass. She looks like a young, glamorous headmistress who\u2019s about to tell me I\u2019ve let down the whole school.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I muster a bright tone. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>She can\u2019t read your mind, I\u2019m telling myself feverishly. She doesn\u2019t know you had her trailed. She can\u2019t prove the T-shirt is about her. Just act innocent.</p><p>\u201cLook, Becky.\u201d Venetia drains her glass in one gulp. \u201cLet\u2019s cut the crap.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her in shock. Did she just say \u201ccrap\u201d?</p><p>\u201cWe were trying to spare you any unpleasantness.\u201d Venetia\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cWe wanted to be as...I don\u2019t know...as amicable as possible. But if this is the attitude you\u2019re going to take...\u201d She gestures at the T-shirt.</p><p>I\u2019m missing something here. In fact, I\u2019m missing everything.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018we\u2019?\u201d I say.</p><p>Venetia gazes at me as though suspecting a trick. Then, very slowly, her expression changes. She exhales and rubs her brow. \u201cOh God,\u201d she says, almost as though to herself.</p><p>I feel a thud of foreboding deep inside. A kind of hot nausea is slowly rising through me. She can\u2019t mean what I\u2014</p><p>She can\u2019t.</p><p>The noise and chatter of the bar has dwindled to a rushing in my ears. I swallow several times, trying to keep a grip on myself. I know I thought something might be going on. I know I talked about it with Suze and Jess and Danny.</p> <p>But all of a sudden, standing here now, I realize I didn\u2019t ever really think it was true. Not really. Not really.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d I can\u2019t quite control my voice. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>A waiter is passing with a tray of drinks, and Venetia puts out a hand to stop him.</p><p>\u201cVodka tonic on the rocks, please,\u201d she says. \u201cStraightaway. Anything for you, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...tell me.\u201d My eyes burn into hers. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>The waiter moves away and Venetia thrusts a hand through her hair. She looks a little ruffled by my reaction. \u201cBecky...this was always going to be difficult. You should know, Luke feels terrible about what\u2019s been going on. He really cares about you. He\u2019ll be livid that I\u2019ve spoken to you, even.\u201d</p><p>For a few moments I can\u2019t reply. I\u2019m just staring at her, my whole body tensed up. I feel like I\u2019ve swung into some parallel universe.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d I repeat huskily.</p><p>\u201cHe really doesn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d Venetia leans closer, and I get a sickening waft of Allure. \u201cAs he keeps saying...he made a mistake. Pure and simple. He married the wrong person. But that\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>Something starts stabbing at my chest. For a moment I\u2019m not sure I can speak, for shock.</p><p>\u201cLuke didn\u2019t marry the wrong person,\u201d I manage at last. \u201cHe married the right person. He loves me, OK? He loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met right after he split up from Sacha, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Venetia nods, even though I haven\u2019t replied. \u201cHe told me all about it. You were a refreshing change, Becky. You make him laugh. But you\u2019re hardly on the same level. You don\u2019t really understand what he\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d My throat isn\u2019t working properly. \u201cI totally understand Luke! We went round the world on our honeymoon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019ve known Luke since he was nineteen.\u201d She cuts across me, invincible, inexorable. \u201cI know him. What we had at Cambridge was powerful. It was intoxicating. He was my first real love. I was his. We were like Odysseus and Penelope. When we saw each other again in my consulting room...\u201d She breaks off. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. But we both knew, instantly. It was just a matter of when and where.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My legs seem to have turned to dust. My face is numb. I\u2019m clutching my stupid feathers, trying to find a pithy, witty...something. But my head feels like a heavy lump of flannel. I have a horrible feeling there are tears on my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been appalling timing.\u201d Venetia takes her drink from the waiter. \u201cLuke didn\u2019t want to say anything until after the baby came. But I think you deserve to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went looking at prams together yesterday.\u201d My voice comes out thick and rushed. \u201cHow come he went to look at prams, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s excited about the baby!\u201d says Venetia in surprise. \u201cHe wants to see his child as much as possible after...\u201d She pauses delicately. \u201cHe wants the whole thing to be amicable. But obviously that depends on you.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t listen to her sweet, poisonous voice anymore. I have to get away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Venetia,\u201d I say, struggling clumsily into my coat. \u201cYou\u2019re deluded. Luke and I have a strong, loving marriage! We laugh, and we talk, and we have sex....\u201d</p><p>Venetia just looks at me with infinite pity. \u201cBecky, Luke\u2019s just playing along to keep you happy. You don\u2019t have a marriage. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t wait to say good-bye to Danny. I head straight out of the bar on stumbling legs and hail a taxi. All the way home, Venetia\u2019s words are going round and round in my brain, until I want to throw up.</p><p>It can\u2019t be true, I keep telling myself. It can\u2019t be.</p> <p>Of course it can, a small voice replies. It\u2019s what you suspected all along.</p><p>I let myself into the flat and immediately hear Luke moving around in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d he calls out.</p><p>My throat\u2019s too tight to answer. I feel paralyzed. At last Luke pops his head round the door. He\u2019s already in dress trousers and a crisp Armani dress shirt. His bow tie is loose around his neck, ready for me to tie it like I always do.</p><p>I stare at him wordlessly. Are you leaving me for Venetia? Is our whole marriage a sham?</p><p>\u201cHi, darling.\u201d He takes a sip of wine.</p> <p>I feel like I\u2019m standing on a cliff edge. The moment I speak, it will all be over.</p><p>\u201cBecky? Sweetheart?\u201d Luke takes a few steps toward me, looking puzzled. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d He peers curiously at the feathers.</p><p>I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t ask him. I\u2019m too frightened of what I\u2019ll hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and get ready,\u201d I whisper, unable to meet his eye. \u201cWe need to leave soon.\u201d</p><p>I head to the bedroom and strip off, bundling Danny\u2019s T-shirt into the bottom of the wardrobe where Luke will never look. Then I take a quick shower, hoping it\u2019ll make me feel better. But it doesn\u2019t. As I catch sight of myself in the mirror, wrapped in a towel, I look scared and pale.</p><p>Come on, Becky. Chin up. Think glam. Think Catherine Zeta-Jones. I get out my slinky new midnight-blue dress and slip it on, thinking this at least will cheer me up. But somehow the dress doesn\u2019t look as good as it did before. It\u2019s not clingy, it\u2019s puckering. I haul at the zipper but it won\u2019t go up.</p><p>It\u2019s too small.</p><p>My perfect dress is too small. I must have grown some more. My bump, or my thighs, or somewhere. My whole body\u2019s suddenly got huge.</p> <p>I can feel my chin wobbling, but desperately clamp my lips shut. I am not going to cry. I wrench off the dress as best I can and head to the wardrobe to find something else. And then I glimpse myself in the mirror, and freeze. I\u2019m waddling.</p><p>I\u2019m a white, fat, waddling...monstrosity.</p><p>I sit down on the bed, feeling dizzy. My head is pounding and there are spots before my eyes. No wonder he chose Venetia.</p><p>\u201cBecky, are you OK?\u201d Luke is at the door, surveying me in alarm. I hadn\u2019t even noticed him.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Tears are blocking my throat. \u201cI\u2019m...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look well. Why don\u2019t you lie down? I\u2019ll bring you some water.\u201d</p><p>As I watch him go, Venetia\u2019s voice is in my head like a coiled snake. He\u2019s playing along to keep you happy.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice makes me jump. He hands me a glass of water and two chocolate biscuits. \u201cI think you should rest for a while.\u201d</p><p>I take the glass without drinking. Suddenly everything feels like acting. He\u2019s acting. I\u2019m acting.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the reunion?\u201d I say at last. \u201cWe need to go soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can be late. Or we can miss it. Darling, have some water, lie down....\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly I take a sip of water, then put my head on the pillow. Luke tucks the duvet over me and quietly leaves the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know how long I lie there for. It feels like about thirty seconds. Or six hours. Afterward I work out it was about twenty minutes.</p><p>And then I hear the voices. His voice. And her voice. Approaching down the corridor.</p><p>\u201c...hope you don\u2019t mind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, absolutely. Luke, you did the right thing to call. So, how\u2019s the patient?\u201d</p> <p>I open my eyes, and it\u2019s a nightmare come true. There, looming in front of me, is Venetia.</p><p>She\u2019s changed into a full-length strapless black taffeta ball gown with a swirly skirt. Her hair is pinned up in a chignon, and diamonds are flashing at her ears. She looks like a princess.</p><p>\u201cLuke says you\u2019re not feeling well, Becky?\u201d Her smile is syrupy sweet. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I spit out.</p><p>\u201cLuke called me. He was worried!\u201d Venetia puts a hand on my head and I flinch. \u201cLet me see if you\u2019ve got a temperature.\u201d She sits on the bed with a rustle of taffeta and opens a little medical case.</p> <p>\u201cLuke, I don\u2019t want her here!\u201d With no warning, tears are spilling from my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not ill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen.\u201d Venetia is advancing a thermometer toward my mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I turn my head away like a baby refusing its porridge.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Becky,\u201d Venetia says in cajoling tones. \u201cI just want to take your temperature....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Luke takes my hand. \u201cCome on. We can\u2019t take any risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ill\u2014\u201d My words are stifled as Venetia jams the thermometer in my mouth and stands up.</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think she should come tonight,\u201d she says in a low voice, drawing Luke aside. \u201cCan you persuade her to stay here and rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Luke nods. \u201cPlease send our apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying behind too?\u201d Venetia frowns. \u201cLuke, I really think...\u201d She beckons Luke out of the room and I can hear low murmurings coming from the corridor. A few moments later Luke appears around the door again, holding a jug of water.</p><p>Someone\u2019s tied his bow tie up, I suddenly notice. I want to burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cBecky. Sweetheart, Venetia thinks you should take it easy.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him silently, the thermometer still in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you, of course. If you want me to.\u201d He hesitates awkwardly. \u201cBut...if you didn\u2019t mind me popping out just for half an hour, there are a lot of people coming to this reunion I\u2019d like to see.\u201d</p><p>My throat is thickening. Fresh tears are springing to my eyes. I can see it all plainly now. He wants to go to the party with Venetia. They\u2019ve probably engineered this whole thing.</p> <p>What am I going to do, beg him not to? I\u2019ve got more pride than that.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I mumble, turning my head away so he can\u2019t see my tears. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I take the thermometer out of my mouth. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a rustle as Venetia comes into the room again. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look.\u201d She studies the thermometer with a small frown. \u201cYes, you\u2019re slightly feverish. Let\u2019s give you some paracetamol....\u201d</p><p>She hands me two tablets and I gulp them down with the water which Luke brought in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019ll be OK?\u201d he says, watching me anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYes. Enjoy yourself.\u201d I pull the duvet over my head and feel my tears drenching the pillow.</p><p>\u201cBye, sweetheart.\u201d I can feel Luke patting the duvet. \u201cGet some rest.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s some muffled talking, and then in the distance I hear the door slam. That\u2019s it. They\u2019ve gone.</p><p>It\u2019s about half an hour before I even move. I push back the duvet and wipe my wet eyes. I get out of bed, stagger into the bathroom, and look at myself. I\u2019m a fright. My eyes are red and puffy. My cheeks are tear-stained. My hair is all over the place.</p><p>I splash my face with water and sit down on the edge of the bathtub. What am I going to do? I can\u2019t just stay here all night, wondering and worrying and imagining the worst. I\u2019d rather just catch them. I\u2019d rather just see it for my own eyes.</p><p>I\u2019ll go there. The thought hits me like a bullet.</p><p>I\u2019ll go to the reunion right now, this minute. What\u2019s to stop me? I\u2019m not ill. I\u2019m fine.</p><p>I head back into the bedroom with a fresh determination. I fling open my wardrobe doors and pull out a black chiffon maternity kaftan that I bought in the summer and never wore because it felt too tentlike. OK. Accessories. A few long, glittery necklaces...a pair of sparkly heels...diamond earrings...I wrench open my makeup case and apply as much as I can, as quickly as I can. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take a step back and look at myself head to foot in the mirror. I look...fine. Not exactly my most polished outfit ever, but fine.</p><p>Adrenaline is beating through me as I grab an evening bag and stuff my keys, mobile, and purse into it. I wrap a shawl around myself and head out the front door, my chin jutting with resolve. I\u2019ll show them. Or I\u2019ll catch them. Or...something. I\u2019m not some helpless victim who\u2019s tamely going to lie in bed while her husband\u2019s with another woman.</p><p>I manage to catch a cab straight outside our building, and as it zooms off I sit back and practice my confrontation lines. I need to hold my head high and be sarcastic yet noble. And not burst into tears or hit Venetia.</p><p>Well, maybe I could hit Venetia. A ringing slap on her cheek, after I\u2019ve laid into Luke.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still married, by the way,\u201d I rehearse under my breath. \u201cForget something, Luke? Like your wife?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re getting near now, and I feel light-headed with nerves...but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m still going to do it. I\u2019m going to be strong. As the taxi draws up, I hand a wodge of crumpled money to the driver and get out. It\u2019s started to rain, and a cold breeze is cutting right through my chiffon kaftan. I need to get inside.</p><p>I totter over the open square toward the grand stone entrance of the Guildhall and through the heavy oak doors. Inside, the reception area is full of pale blue helium balloons in bunches, and banners reading CAMBRIDGE REUNION, and a huge pin board covered in old photographs of students. In front of me a group of four men are slapping each other on the back and exclaiming things like \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still alive, you bastard!\u201d As I hesitate, wondering where to go, a girl in a red ball gown sitting behind a cloth-draped table smiles up at me.</p><p>\u201cHello! Do you have your invitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband has it.\u201d I try to sound calm, like any normal guest. \u201cHe arrived earlier than me. Luke Brandon?\u201d The girl runs a finger down her list, then stops.</p> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d She smiles at me. \u201cDo go in, Mrs. Brandon.\u201d</p><p>I follow the group of bantering guys into the great hall and accept a glass of champagne on autopilot. I\u2019ve never been here before and I didn\u2019t realize how huge it was. There are massive stained-glass windows and ancient stone statues, and an orchestra is playing in the gallery, amplified over the roar of chatter. People in evening dress are milling and chatting and collecting food from a buffet, and some are even dancing old-fashioned waltzes, like something out of a film. I look around, trying to spot Luke or Venetia, but the room is so busy with women in beautiful dresses, and men in black tie, and even a few particularly dashing men in tails....</p><p>And then I see them. Dancing together.</p><p>Luke was right, he does waltz as well as Fred Astaire. He\u2019s skimming Venetia around the floor like an expert. Her skirt is twirling, and her head is thrown back as she smiles up at Luke. They\u2019re perfectly in time with each other. The most glamorous couple in the room.</p><p>I\u2019m rooted to the spot as I watch them, my kaftan clinging damply to my shins. All the sarcastic, feisty phrases I prepared have shriveled on my lips. I\u2019m not sure I can breathe, let alone speak.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d A waiter is addressing me, but his voice seems to be coming from miles away and his face is out of focus.</p> <p>I never once waltzed with Luke. And now it\u2019s too late.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s falling!\u201d I can feel hands grabbing at me as my legs give way beneath me. My arm bashes against something and there\u2019s a ringing in my ears and the sound of a woman shouting \u201cGet some water! There\u2019s a pregnant woman here!\u201d</p><p>And then everything goes dark.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>I THOUGHT MARRIAGE was forever. I really did. I thought Luke and I would grow old and gray together. Or at least old. (I\u2019m not intending to go gray, ever. Or wear those gross dresses with elastic waistbands.)</p><p>But we\u2019re not going to grow old together. We\u2019re not going to sit on benches together, or watch our grandchildren play. I\u2019m not even going to make it past thirty with him. Our marriage has failed.</p><p>Every time I try to speak I think I\u2019ll cry, so I\u2019m not really speaking. Luckily there\u2019s no one here to speak to. I\u2019m in a private room at the Cavendish Hospital, which is where they brought me last night. If you want attention at a hospital, just arrive with a celebrity doctor in black tie. I\u2019ve never seen so many nurses running around. First they thought I might be in labor, and then they thought I might have preeclampsia, but in the end they decided I was just a bit overtired and dehydrated. So they put me in this bed, with a saline drip. I should be going home today, after I\u2019ve been checked out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke stayed with me all night too. But I couldn\u2019t bring myself to talk to him. So I pretended I was asleep, even this morning when he quietly said, \u201cBecky? Are you awake?\u201d</p><p>Now he\u2019s gone off to take a shower and I\u2019ve opened my eyes. It\u2019s a really nice room, with soft green walls and even a little sofa. But who cares, when my life is over? What does anything matter anymore?</p><p>I know two out of three marriages fail, or whatever it is. But I honestly thought...</p><p>I thought we were...</p> <p>Roughly, I brush a tear away. I\u2019m not going to cry.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d The door opens and a nurse pushes in a trolley. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, my voice croaky, and I sit up as she plumps my pillows around me. I take a sip of tea and eat a piece of toast, just so the baby has something to keep it going. Then I check my reflection in my compact mirror. God, I look like crap. I\u2019ve still got on the remnants of last night\u2019s makeup, and my hair has frizzed from the rain. And the so-called \u201chydrating\u201d drip has done nothing for my skin.</p><p>I look like a reject.</p><p>I gaze at myself, feeling bitter. It\u2019s what happens to everyone. You get married and you think everything\u2019s great, but all the time your husband was having an affair and then he leaves you for another woman with red swishy hair. I should have seen it coming. I never should have relaxed.</p> <p>I gave that man the best years of my life, and now I\u2019m tossed aside for a newer model.</p><p>Well, OK, I gave him a year and a half of my life. And she\u2019s older than me. But still.</p><p>There\u2019s another movement at the door and I stiffen. A moment later it opens and Luke cautiously makes his way in. There are faint shadows beneath his eyes, I notice, and he\u2019s cut himself shaving.</p><p>Good. I\u2019m glad he did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d he says. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>I nod, clamping my lips together. I\u2019m not going to give him the satisfaction of seeing me upset. I\u2019m going to keep my dignity, even if it means I can only talk in monosyllables.</p> <p>\u201cYou look better.\u201d He sits down on the bed. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Again I hear Venetia\u2019s cool, assured voice: Luke\u2019s just playing along to keep you happy. I look up and meet his gaze, willing him to give himself away, searching for some chink in his fa\u00e7ade. But he\u2019s putting on the best act I\u2019ve ever seen. A concerned, loving husband at his wife\u2019s bedside.</p><p>I\u2019ve always known Luke was good at PR. It\u2019s his job. It\u2019s made him a millionaire. But I never realized he could be this good. I never knew he could be this...double-faced.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Now he\u2019s searching my face. \u201cIs everything OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not.\u201d There\u2019s silence as I summon up all my strength. \u201cLuke...I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d Luke\u2019s tone is easy but at once there\u2019s a guarded look in his eyes. \u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend, OK?\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cVenetia told me. She told me what\u2019s been going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you?\u201d Luke gets to his feet, his face aghast. \u201cShe had no right\u2014\u201d He breaks off and turns away. And I feel a sickening thud deep inside me. Everything is suddenly hurting. My head, my eyes, my limbs.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t realized how hard I was clinging to a last shred of hope. That somehow Luke would sweep me up in his arms, explain everything away, and tell me he loved me. But the shred\u2019s melted away. It\u2019s all over.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she thought I ought to know.\u201d Somehow I muster tones of cutting sarcasm. \u201cMaybe she thought I\u2019d be interested!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky...I was trying to protect you.\u201d Luke turns, and he looks genuinely miserable. \u201cThe baby. Your blood pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, when were you planning to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Luke exhales, pacing to the window and back again. \u201cAfter the baby. I was going to see how things...played out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I can\u2019t do this anymore. I can\u2019t be dignified and grown-up. I want to yell and scream at him. I want to burst into sobs and throw things.</p><p>\u201cLuke, please...just go.\u201d My voice is barely above a whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He doesn\u2019t move an inch. \u201cBecky...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Luke rubs his face hard, as though trying to scrub away his problems. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be going to Geneva. The De Savatier Investment Fund launch. It could not have come at a worst time. I can cancel....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo.

I\u2019m not listening to him tell me all about how he fell for Venetia, and he never meant to hurt me but he just couldn\u2019t help himself, and he still sees me as a good friend.</p><p>I\u2019d rather not know anything about it, ever.</p><p>\u201cLuke, just leave me alone!\u201d I spit it out without turning my head. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t want to talk about it. And anyway, I\u2019m supposed to stay calm for the baby. You\u2019re not supposed to upset me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Fine. Well, I\u2019ll go then.\u201d</p><p>Luke sounds pretty upset himself now. Well, tough luck.</p> <p>I\u2019m aware of him walking across the room, his tread slow and reluctant.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s in town,\u201d he says. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve told her to leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I mumble into the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you when I get back. Should be around Friday lunchtime. OK?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t respond. What does he mean, he\u2019ll see me? When he comes round to move all his stuff into Venetia\u2019s flat? When he summons a meeting with his divorce lawyers?</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence and I know Luke\u2019s still there, waiting. But then, at last, I hear the door open and close, and the faint sound of his footsteps disappearing down the corridor.</p> <p>I wait ten minutes before I lift my head. I feel surreal and kind of blurry, as though I\u2019m in the middle of a dream. I can\u2019t quite believe this is all really happening. I\u2019m eight months pregnant and Luke\u2019s having an affair with our obstetrician and our marriage is over.</p><p>Our marriage is over. I repeat the words to myself, but they don\u2019t ring true. I can\u2019t make them register. It seems only five minutes ago that we were on honeymoon, blissfully lazing on the beach. That we were dancing at our wedding in Mum\u2019s back garden, me in Mum\u2019s old frilly wedding dress and a lopsided flower garland. That a whole press conference was stopping still for him to pass me a twenty-quid note so I could buy a Denny and George scarf. Back in the days when I barely knew him, when he was the sexy mysterious Luke Brandon and I wasn\u2019t even sure he knew my name.</p><p>I feel a wrenching pain deep inside, and all of a sudden tears are spilling onto my cheeks, and I\u2019m burying my sobbing head in the sheets. How can he leave me? Hasn\u2019t he enjoyed being married to me? Haven\u2019t we had fun together?</p><p>Before I can stop it, Venetia\u2019s voice slides into my head. You were a refreshing change, Becky. You make him laugh. But you\u2019re hardly on the same level.</p><p>Stupid...stupid...cow. Bitch. Skinny...horrible...pretentious...</p><p>I wipe my eyes and sit up and take three long breaths. I\u2019m not going to think about her. Or any of it.</p><p>There\u2019s a knocking at the door. \u201cMrs. Brandon?\u201d It sounds like one of the nurses.</p><p>\u201cEr...hang on....\u201d I hastily splash some water onto my face from my drinking jug, and wipe it with the sheet. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>The door opens and the pretty nurse who brought me my breakfast smiles at me. \u201cYou have a visitor.\u201d</p><p>My mind leaps in one joyous bound to Luke. He\u2019s come back, he\u2019s sorry, it was all a mistake....</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d I grab my compact from the cabinet, grimace at my reflection, and tug at my frizzy hair.</p><p>\u201cA Mrs. Sherman?\u201d</p><p>I nearly drop the compact in dismay. Elinor? Elinor\u2019s here? I thought Luke told her to leave me alone.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen Elinor since our wedding in New York. Or at least...our \u201cwedding\u201d in New York.(It was all a bit complicated in the end.) We\u2019ve never really got on, mainly on account of her being a snobby, ice-cold bitch, who abandoned Luke when he was tiny and totally screwed him up. And the way she was rude to Mum. And the way she didn\u2019t let me into my own bloody engagement party! And\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you OK, Rebecca?\u201d The nurse looks at me in slight alarm, and I realize I\u2019m breathing harder and harder. \u201cI can tell her you\u2019re asleep if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please. Tell her to go away.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in no state to see anyone right now. Not with my face all pink and my eyes still teary. And why should I make any effort to see Elinor? Surely the only advantage of splitting up with your husband is that you don\u2019t need to see your mother-in-law anymore. I won\u2019t miss her, and she won\u2019t miss me.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d The nurse comes over and squints at my drip. \u201cA doctor will be along soon to check you over, then I should think you\u2019ll be going home. Should I tell Mrs. Sherman that you\u2019ll be leaving?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually...\u201d</p><p>A new thought has just struck me. There\u2019s an even bigger advantage to splitting up with your husband. You don\u2019t have to be polite to your mother-in-law anymore.</p><p>I can say what I like to Elinor. I can be as rude as I like. For the first time in days, I feel a streak of cheer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019ll see her after all. Just let me get ready....\u201d I reach for my makeup bag and clumsily knock it to the floor. The nurse picks it up and gives me an anxious look.</p> <p>\u201cAre you OK? You seem very on edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I was just a bit...upset earlier. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>The nurse disappears, and I open my makeup bag. I dab on some eye gel and brush myself with bronzer. I am not going to look like a victim here. I\u2019m not going to look like some poor pathetic wronged wife. I have no idea what Elinor knows, but if she even mentions Luke and me splitting up, or dares to look pleased about it, I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll tell her the baby isn\u2019t Luke\u2019s, that it was fathered by my prison penpal Wayne and the whole scandal\u2019s going to hit the papers tomorrow. That\u2019ll freak her out.</p><p>I spray myself with perfume and quickly slick on some lip gloss as I hear footsteps approaching. There\u2019s a knock at the door and I call, \u201cCome in.\u201d A moment later it swings open \u2014 and there she is.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a mint-green suit and the same Ferragamo pumps she buys every season, and she\u2019s carrying a crocodile Kelly bag. She\u2019s thinner than ever, her hair a lacquered helmet, her face pale and stretched-looking. Which figures. When I worked in Barneys in New York, I saw women like Elinor every single day. But over here she looks...Well, there\u2019s no other word for it: weird.</p> <p>Her mouth moves a millimeter, and I realize this is her greeting. \u201cHi, Elinor.\u201d I don\u2019t bother trying to smile. She\u2019ll just assume I\u2019ve had Botox too. \u201cWelcome to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon is so tawdry these days,\u201d she says with disapproval. \u201cSo tasteless.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s just unbelievable. The whole of London is tasteless?</p><p>\u201cYeah, especially the Queen,\u201d I say. \u201cShe has no idea.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring me, Elinor stalks to a chair and sits down on the edge of it. She surveys me stonily for a few moments. \u201cI gather you left the doctor I recommended, Rebecca. Who are you seeing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s...Venetia Carter.\u201d I feel a knife of pain as I say the name. But Elinor doesn\u2019t react a smidgen. She can\u2019t know.</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen Luke?\u201d I venture.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She pulls off a pair of calfskin gloves and runs her eyes over my hospital-gowned frame. \u201cYou\u2019ve put on a lot of weight, Rebecca. Does this new doctor approve?\u201d</p><p>You see? This is what she\u2019s like. Not \u201cHow are you?\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t you look blooming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d I snap. \u201cAnd I\u2019m having a big baby.\u201d</p><p>Elinor\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t soften. \u201cNot too large, I hope. Oversize babies are vulgar.\u201d</p><p>Vulgar? How dare she call my lovely baby vulgar?</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s going to be big,\u201d I say in defiance. \u201cThat way there\u2019ll be more room for...the tattoos.\u201d</p><p>I can just about see a jolt of shock pass across her practically immobile face. That\u2019ll bust her stitches. Or staples. Whatever\u2019s holding her together.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Luke tell you about our tattoo plans?\u201d I adopt a surprised tone. \u201cWe\u2019ve found a special newborn-baby tattooist who comes right into the delivery room. We thought we\u2019d have an eagle on its back, with our names in Sanskrit....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not tattooing my grandchild.\u201d Her voice is like gunfire.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, we are. Luke really got the tattoo bug while we were on honeymoon. He has fifteen of them!\u201d I smile blandly at her. \u201cAnd as soon as the baby\u2019s born he\u2019s going to get its name tattooed on his arm. Isn\u2019t that sweet?\u201d</p><p>Elinor\u2019s gripping her Kelly bag so hard, the veins are standing up. I can tell she doesn\u2019t know whether to believe me or not.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided on a name?\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I nod. \u201cArmageddon for a boy, Pomegranate for a girl.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she seems unable to reply. I can tell she\u2019s desperate to raise her eyebrows, or frown, or something. I almost feel sorry for her real face, trapped under the Botox like a caged animal.</p><p>\u201cArmageddon?\u201d she manages at last.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d I nod again. \u201cMacho, but kind of elegant. And unusual!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elinor looks like she\u2019s going to explode.

You\u2019re...irresponsible beyond\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Irresponsible\u2019?\u201d I interrupt in disbelief. \u201cAre you serious?

All of a sudden my head is buzzing with thoughts.</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d Elinor approaches the bed, her eyes snapping. \u201cI have no idea if you\u2019re being frank with me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I lift a hand, not caring if I\u2019m rude. I have to concentrate. I have to think this through. I\u2019m suddenly starting to see things clearly, like a tune falling into place.</p><p>Elinor walked out on Luke. Now Luke\u2019s walking out on our baby. It\u2019s history repeating itself. Does Luke realize this? If he just saw it...if he just understood what he was doing...</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d</p><p>I look up, as though out of a daze. Elinor looks like she wants to pop with exasperation.</p><p>\u201cOh, Elinor...I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, all rancor gone. \u201cIt was lovely of you to come by, but I\u2019m a bit tired now. Please drop round for tea sometime.\u201d</p> <p>Elinor looks like the wind has been taken out of her sails. I think she was probably squaring up for a fight too.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she says frostily. \u201cI\u2019m staying at Claridge\u2019s. Here are the details of my exhibition.\u201d</p><p>She hands me an invitation for a private viewing, along with a glossy brochure entitled \u201cThe Elinor Sherman Collection.\u201d It\u2019s illustrated with a photograph of an elegant white plinth, on top of which is resting another, smaller white plinth.</p><p>God, I don\u2019t understand modern art.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, eyeing it dubiously. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sure to make it. Thanks for coming. Have a nice day!\u201d</p><p>Elinor gives me one last, narrowed look, then picks up her gloves and Kelly bag and strides out of the room. As soon as she\u2019s gone, I bury my head in my hands, trying to think. Somehow I have to get through to Luke. He doesn\u2019t want to do this. Deep in his heart, I know he doesn\u2019t. I feel like he\u2019s been lured away by the evil fairies and I just need to break the spell.</p> <p>But how? What do I do? If I call him, he\u2019ll brush me off and promise to call back later and never will. His e-mails are read by his secretaries.... It\u2019s not exactly a subject for a text....</p><p>I have to write a letter.</p><p>It hits me like a thunderbolt. I have to write a letter, like in the old days before phone calls and e-mail. God, yes. I\u2019ll compose the best letter I\u2019ve ever written in my life. I\u2019ll explain all my feelings, and his. (He sometimes needs them explained to him.) I\u2019ll put the case before him plainly.</p><p>I\u2019m going to save our marriage. He doesn\u2019t want a broken family \u2014 I know he doesn\u2019t. I know he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>A nurse is passing by the door, and I call out, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She looks in with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible to get some writing paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some in the hospital shop, or...\u201d She frowns in thought. \u201cOne of my colleagues has some, I think.

Once I started, I just couldn\u2019t stop. I had no idea there was so much pent up inside me.</p><p>I started off talking about our wedding and how happy we were then. Then I talked about all the things we love to do together, and how much fun we\u2019ve had and how excited we were when we discovered we were having a baby. Then I moved on to Venetia. I didn\u2019t call her by name. I called her the Threat to Our Marriage. He\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about.</p><p>And now I\u2019m on page seventeen (one of the nurses ran down and bought me my own pad of Basildon Bond) and I\u2019m getting to the main bit. The plea to him to give our marriage another shot. Tears are running down my face, and I keep having to break off to snuffle into a tissue.</p><p>In our vows, you promised to love me forever. I know you think you don\u2019t anymore. I know there are other women in this world, who are maybe cleverer and maybe can speak Latin.

I need some way for him to show me...to answer...to let me know...</p> <p>Suddenly it comes to me. We need a great big tall tower, just like in romantic movies. And we\u2019ll meet at the top at midnight....</p><p>No. I get too tired by midnight. We\u2019ll meet at the top at...six o\u2019clock. The wind will be blowing and Gershwin will be playing and I\u2019ll see from his eyes that he\u2019s put Venetia behind him forever. And I\u2019ll say simply, \u201cAre you coming home?\u201d And he\u2019ll say\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you OK, Becky?\u201d The nurse pops her head round the door. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly finished.\u201d I blow my nose. \u201cWhere\u2019s a tall tower in London? If I wanted to meet someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d The nurse wrinkles her nose. \u201cThe Oxo Tower\u2019s pretty tall. I went there the other day. They\u2019ve got a viewing platform and a restaurant....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>Luke, if you love me and want to save our marriage, meet me at the top of the Oxo Tower at six o\u2019clock on Friday. I will be waiting at the viewing platform.</p><p>Your loving wife,</p><p>Becky.</p><p>I put my pen down, feeling totally drained, as though I\u2019ve just composed a Beethoven symphony.

Oh my God. But he hasn\u2019t read the letter yet!</p><p>With trembling hands I grab the phone, but it\u2019s not Luke after all. It\u2019s a number I don\u2019t recognize. It isn\u2019t Elinor calling to lecture me, is it?</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I say cautiously.</p><p>\u201cHello, Becky? It\u2019s Martha here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I push my hair back off my face, trying to place the name. \u201cEr...hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust checking you\u2019re still all set for the shoot on Friday?\u201d she says chattily. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see your house!\u201d</p><p>Vogue. Shit. I\u2019d totally forgotten about it.</p><p>How could I forget about a Vogue photo shoot? God, my life must really be in pieces.</p> <p>\u201cSo, is everything OK?\u201d Martha\u2019s voice is trilling gaily down the phone. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had the baby yet, or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no...\u201d I hesitate. \u201cBut I am in hospital.\u201d As I say the words I realize I shouldn\u2019t really have my mobile on in a hospital. But this is Vogue on the phone. There must be an exemption for Vogue, surely.</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Her voice falls in dismay. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re having such bad luck with this piece! One of the yummy mummies had her twins early, which was really annoying, and the other has had pre-eclampy-something and is on bed rest! We can\u2019t do the interview or anything! Are you on bed rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...hang on a minute....\u201d</p><p>I put the phone down on the bed, trying to galvanize my spirits. I have never felt less like having my picture taken in my life. I\u2019m fat, I\u2019m tear-stained, my hair is terrible, my marriage is crumbling away.... I give a deep, shuddery sigh, and then catch sight of my blurry reflection in a nearby glass-fronted cupboard. Hunched over, head drooping. I look defeated. I look awful.</p><p>In an immediate reflex action I sit up straighter. What am I saying? Is my life over too? Just because my husband had an affair?</p><p>No way. I\u2019m not going to feel sorry for myself. I\u2019m not going to give up. Maybe my life is in pieces. But I can still be yummy. I\u2019ll be the yummiest bloody mummy-to-be they\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>I lift the phone to my ear again. \u201cHi, Martha?\u201d I say, trying to sound breezy. \u201cSorry about that. It\u2019s all fine for the shoot on Friday. I\u2019m coming out of hospital today, so I\u2019ll be there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I can hear the relief in Martha\u2019s voice. \u201cCan\u2019t wait! It\u2019ll only take two or three hours, and I promise we won\u2019t exhaust you! I\u2019m sure you have lots of lovely clothes, but our stylist will bring along some pieces too....

I cannot, however, agree that these are the \u201cbest investments in the world.\u201d</p><p>Please let me reiterate. Free chocolates, samples of perfume, and discount spa treatments \u2014 while pleasant \u2014 are no sound basis for investment.

There is not a single pair of them left in London. Especially not in green. No wonder Fabia wants them, they\u2019re like the Holy Grail or something, except there aren\u2019t even any clues in paintings. I spent yesterday trying all my contacts, every supplier I know, every shop, everywhere. I even called my old colleague Erin at Barneys in New York and she just laughed pityingly.</p><p>In the end, Danny stepped in to help. He made some calls around and finally tracked down a pair to a model he knows who is on a shoot in Paris. In return for a sample jacket, she gave them to a friend who was coming over to London last night. He met up with Danny and now he\u2019s going to deliver them to me.</p><p>That\u2019s the plan. But he isn\u2019t here yet. And it\u2019s already five past ten and I\u2019m starting to panic. I\u2019m standing on the corner of Delamain Road, dressed in my yummiest outfit of red print wrap dress, Prada heels, and a vintage-style fake fur stole, and all the cars keep slowing down to look. In hindsight, this wasn\u2019t the best place to meet. I must look like some eight months\u2019 pregnant hooker for pervy people.</p><p>I take out my phone and, yet again, redial Danny\u2019s number. \u201cDanny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here! We\u2019re coming. We\u2019re just driving over a bridge...whoa!\u201d</p><p>Danny was supposed to be dropping the shoes round last night \u2014 only he went off clubbing instead, with some photographer he met on holiday. (Don\u2019t ask. He started to tell me about the night they spent together in Marrakech, and honestly, I had to put my hands over the baby\u2019s ears.) He\u2019s shrieking with laughter, and I can hear the roar of his friend\u2019s Harley-Davidson. How can he be having fun? Doesn\u2019t he know how stressed out I am?</p><p>I\u2019ve barely slept since Luke has been gone. And when I did get to sleep last night, I had the most awful dream. I dreamed I went to the top of the Oxo Tower, but Luke didn\u2019t show up. I stood for hours in the wind and gale and rain pouring down on me and then at last Luke appeared, but he\u2019d somehow turned into Elinor and she started yelling at me. And then all my hair fell off....</p><p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d</p><p>A woman holding two small children by the hand is approaching, and giving me an odd look.</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d I come to, and move out of the way.</p><p>In real life, I haven\u2019t spoken to Luke since he left. He\u2019s tried to call several times, but I just sent short texts back saying sorry I missed him and everything\u2019s OK. I didn\u2019t want to talk to him until he\u2019d read my letter \u2014 which only happened last night, according to the tracking system. Somebody at the Geneva office signed for it at 6:11 p.m., so he must have read it by now.</p><p>The die is cast. By six o\u2019clock tonight I\u2019ll know, one way or another. Either he\u2019ll be there, waiting for me, or...</p><p>Nausea rises through me and I shake my head briskly. I\u2019m not going to think about it. I\u2019m going to get through this shoot first. I take a bite of a Kit Kat for energy, and glance down again at the printed page that Martha e-mailed me. It\u2019s an interview with one of the other yummy mummies-to-be from the article, which Martha said would \u201cgive me an idea.\u201d The other yummy is called Amelia Gordon-Barraclough. She\u2019s posing in a vast Kensington nursery wearing a beaded kaftan and about fifty-nine bracelets, and all her quotes sound totally smug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe commissioned all our nursery furniture from artisans in Provence.\u201d</p><p>Well. Huh. I\u2019ll say we got all ours from artisans in...outer Mongolia. No, we sourced it. People in glossy magazines never just buy something from a shop, they source it, or discover it in a junkyard, or get left it by their famous designer godmother.</p><p>\u201cMy husband and I do couples\u2019 yoga together twice a day in our \u2018retreat room.\u2019 We feel it creates harmony in our relationship.\u201d</p><p>With a pang, I have a sudden memory of Luke and me doing couples\u2019 yoga on our honeymoon.</p> <p>At least, we were doing yoga, and we were a couple.</p><p>A lump is rising in my throat. No. Stop it. Think confident. Think yummy. I\u2019ll say that Luke and I do something much cooler than yoga. Like that thing I read about the other day. Qi-something.</p><p>My thoughts are broken by the roar of a motorbike, and I look up to see a Harley speeding along the quiet residential street.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I wave my arms. \u201cHere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Becky!\u201d The motorbike comes to a throbbing halt beside me. Danny pulls off a motorbike helmet and leaps off the back, a shoe box in his hand. \u201cThere you go!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Danny, thanks.\u201d I give him an enormous hug. \u201cYou saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d Danny says, getting back on the bike. \u201cLet me know how it goes! This is Zane, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I wave at Zane, who is in leathers from head to foot and raises a hand in greeting. \u201cThanks for the delivery!\u201d</p><p>The motorbike zooms off again. I take hold of the handle of my suitcase, which is filled with spare outfits and props, and pick up the armful of flowers I bought this morning to make the house look nice. I head toward number thirty-three, somehow manhandle the case up the steps, and ring the doorbell. There\u2019s no answer.</p><p>After a pause I ring again and call \u201cFabia!\u201d But there\u2019s still no reply.</p><p>She can\u2019t have forgotten it\u2019s this morning.</p> <p>\u201cFabia! Can you hear me?\u201d I beat on the door. \u201cFa-bi-a!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s dead silence. No one\u2019s there. I feel a beat of panic. What am I going to do? Vogue will be here any\u2014</p><p>\u201cCooee! Hello there!\u201d A voice from the street heralds me and I turn to see a girl leaning out of the window of a Mini Cooper. She\u2019s skinny, has glossy hair, a Kabbala bracelet, and a huge engagement rock. She has to be from Vogue.</p><p>\u201cAre you Becky?\u201d she calls.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I force a bright smile. \u201cHi! Are you Martha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Her eyes are running up and down the storys. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a gorgeous house! I can\u2019t wait to see inside!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Er...thanks!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an expectant pause and I lean casually against one of the pillars. Like I\u2019m just hanging out on my front steps. Like people do.</p> <p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d asks Martha, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I attempt an easy gesture. \u201cJust you know...enjoying the air...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m thinking frantically. Maybe we could do the whole shoot out here on the steps. Yes. I could say the front door is the best feature of the house and the rest of it isn\u2019t worth bothering with....</p><p>\u201cBecky, have you lost your key?\u201d says Martha, still looking puzzled.</p><p>Genius. Of course. Why didn\u2019t I think of that?</p><p>\u201cYes! Silly me!\u201d I hit myself on the head. \u201cAnd none of the neighbors have got one, and there\u2019s no one in....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Martha\u2019s face falls.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I give a regretful shrug. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. But if we can\u2019t get in...\u201d</p><p>As I say the words, the front door opens and I nearly fall into the house. Fabia has appeared, rubbing her eyes and wearing an orange Marni dress.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky.\u201d She sounds so drifty. Like she\u2019s on tranquilizers or something.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Martha\u2019s face lights up. \u201cSomeone was in! How lucky! Who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Fabia. Our...lodger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLodger?\u201d Fabia wrinkles her nose.</p><p>\u201cLodger and good friend,\u201d I amend hastily, putting an arm round her. \u201cWe\u2019re very close....\u201d</p><p>Thank God, down on the street a car has pulled up behind the Mini and is starting to hoot.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d says Martha. \u201cBecky, we\u2019re just going to get some coffees. Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, thanks! I\u2019ll just wait here at home. At my home.\u201d I put a proprietorial hand on the doorknob. \u201cSee you soon!\u201d</p><p>I watch the car disappear, then wheel round to Fabia. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t in! OK, we need to get going. I\u2019ve got the stuff for you. Here\u2019s the bag, and the top....\u201d I hand her the carriers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Her eyes focus on them greedily. \u201cDid you get the shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say. \u201cMy friend Danny got a model to bring them over from Paris. Danny Kovitz, the designer?\u201d</p><p>As I produce the box, I feel a dart of triumph. No one else in the world can get hold of these. I am so connected. I wait for Fabia to gasp or say, \u201cYou\u2019re incredible!\u201d Instead she opens the shoe box, peers at them for a few moments, then wrinkles her brow.</p><p>\u201cThese are the wrong color.\u201d She puts the lid back on and pushes them toward me. \u201cI wanted green.\u201d</p> <p>Is she color-blind? They\u2019re the most gorgeous shade of pale sage green, plus they have Green printed in big letters on the box.</p><p>\u201cFabia, these are green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted more of a...\u201d She waves an arm. \u201cBluey-green.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying really hard to keep my patience. \u201cDo you mean...turquoise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Her face brightens. \u201cTurquoise. That\u2019s what I meant. These ones are too pale.\u201d</p> <p>I do not believe it. These shoes have traveled all the way from Paris via a fashion model and a world-famous designer and she doesn\u2019t want them?</p><p>Well, I\u2019ll have them.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, and take the box back. \u201cI\u2019ll get you the turquoise pair. But I really need to get into the house....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Fabia leans against the door frame and examines a drawn thread on her sleeve. \u201cIt\u2019s not that convenient, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Not convenient? It has to be convenient!</p><p>\u201cBut we agreed on today, remember? The people from Vogue are already here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you put them off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t put Vogue off!\u201d My voice rises in agitation. \u201cThey\u2019re Vogue!\u201d</p><p>She gives one of her careless shrugs, and all of a sudden I\u2019m livid. She knew I was coming. It was all planned. She can\u2019t do this to me!</p><p>\u201cFabia.\u201d I lean close, breathing hard. \u201cYou are not wrecking my only chance to be in Vogue. I got you the top. I got you the bag. I got you the shoes! You have to let me into this house, or...or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d says Fabia.</p><p>\u201cOr...I\u2019ll phone up Barneys and get you blacklisted!\u201d I hiss in sudden inspiration. \u201cThat won\u2019t be much fun if you\u2019re living in New York, will it?\u201d</p><p>Fabia turns pale. Ha. Gotcha.</p><p>\u201cWell, where am I supposed to go?\u201d she says sulkily, taking her arm off the door frame.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Go and have a hot-stone massage or something! Just get out!\u201d I shove my suitcase into the house and push past her into the hall.</p><p>Right. I have to be quick. I snap open my case, take out a silver-framed picture of me and Luke at our wedding and put it prominently on the hall table. There. It looks like my house already!</p><p>\u201cWhere is your husband, anyway?\u201d says Fabia, watching me with folded arms. \u201cShouldn\u2019t he be doing this too? You look like some kind of single mother.\u201d</p><p>Her words hit me unawares. For a few seconds I don\u2019t trust myself to answer.</p><p>\u201cLuke\u2019s...abroad,\u201d I say at last. \u201cBut I\u2019m meeting him later on. At six o\u2019clock. At the viewing platform at the Oxo Tower. He\u2019ll be there.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI know he will.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a hotness in my eyes and I blink fiercely. I\u2019m not going to disintegrate.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Fabia stares at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...quite an important day for me.\u201d I get out a tissue and dab my eyes. \u201cCould I have a glass of water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I can hear Fabia muttering as she heads toward the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s only bloody Vogue.\u201d</p><p>OK. I\u2019m getting there. Twenty minutes have passed, Fabia has finally gone, and the house is really feeling as though it\u2019s mine. I\u2019ve taken down all Fabia\u2019s photographs and replaced them with ones of me and my family. I\u2019ve put B and L initial cushions on the sofa in the living room. I\u2019ve arranged flowers in vases everywhere. I\u2019ve memorized the contents of the kitchen cupboards and even planted some Post-it notes on the fridge, saying things like \u201cWe need more organic quinoa, darling\u201d and \u201cLuke \u2014 remember Couples\u2019 Qi-gong on Saturday!\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m hastily decanting some of my own shoes into Fabia\u2019s shoe cupboard, because they\u2019re bound to ask me about my accessories. I\u2019m just counting how many pairs of Jimmy Choos there are, when the doorbell suddenly rings, and I jump in a flurry of panic. I shove the rest of the shoes into the cupboard, check my reflection, and head down the stairs with trembling legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is it!

Earrings: present from Mum.</p><p>No, that\u2019s not cool enough. I\u2019ll call them...model\u2019s own. No, vintage. I\u2019ll say I found them sewn into a 1930s corset which I bought from an old atelier in a backstreet in Paris. Perfect.</p><p>I swing open the front door, plastering a bright smile on my face \u2014 and freeze.</p> <p>It\u2019s not Vogue. It\u2019s Luke.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing an overcoat and holding an overnight case and it looks like he didn\u2019t shave this morning.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d he says with no preamble, lifting up my letter.</p><p>I stare back at him, dumbstruck. This isn\u2019t right. He\u2019s supposed to be at the Oxo Tower looking all romantic and loving. Not here on the doorstep, disheveled and moody.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I swallow. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d he echoes incredulously. \u201cI\u2019m reacting to this! You didn\u2019t answer any of my calls, I had no bloody idea what was going on.... \u2018Meet me at the top of the Oxo Tower.\u2019\u201d He shakes the letter at me. \u201cWhat is all this crap?\u201d</p><p>Crap?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not crap!\u201d I cry, stung. \u201cI was trying to save our marriage, in case you hadn\u2019t realized\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave our marriage?\u201d He stares at me. \u201cAt the Oxo Tower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works in films! You were supposed to turn up, and it was all supposed to be lovely, like in Sleepless in Seattle....\u201d</p><p>My voice is thickening with disappointment. I so thought it was going to work. I so thought he was going to be there, and we\u2019d run into each other\u2019s arms, and be a happy family again.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I\u2019m obviously missing something.\u201d Luke is frowning down at the letter again. \u201cThis letter doesn\u2019t even make sense. \u2018I know you had an\u2014\u2014\u2019 Blank. What did I have? An embolism?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s mocking me. I can\u2019t bear it.</p><p>\u201cAn affair!\u201d I yell. \u201cAn affair! Your affair with Venetia! I know about it, remember? And I just thought maybe you wanted to give our marriage another shot, but obviously not, so please just go. I have a Vogue shoot to do.\u201d I brush angrily at my tear-filled eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d He seems genuinely shell-shocked. \u201cBecky, you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d I make to close the door, but he grabs my wrist hard.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice is like thunder. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck\u2019s going on. I get this letter out of the blue...you\u2019re accusing me of having an affair.... You can\u2019t run away without explaining.\u201d</p><p>Has he moved in to a parallel universe? Did someone hit him over the head or something?</p><p>\u201cYou admitted it yourself, Luke!\u201d I practically shriek in frustration. \u201cYou said you\u2019d been trying to \u2018protect\u2019 me, because of my blood pressure or whatever. Remember that?\u201d</p> <p>Luke\u2019s eyes are scanning my face, back and forth, as though searching for answers.</p><p>\u201cThe conversation we had in the hospital,\u201d he says suddenly. \u201cBefore I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Does it all come flooding back now?\u201d I can\u2019t help sounding sarcastic. \u201cYou were planning to tell me after the baby. You were going to see how things \u2018played out.\u2019 You basically admitted it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about having a fucking affair!\u201d Luke explodes. \u201cI was talking about the crisis situation with Arcodas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d The wind is instantly taken out of my sails. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>I suddenly notice two children standing on the pavement, staring at us. I guess we do look quite conspicuous, what with my huge bump and everything.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s adjourn inside,\u201d I say in dignified tones. Luke follows my gaze.</p><p>\u201cRight. Yes. Let\u2019s...do that.\u201d</p><p>He steps into the house and I close the door. For a moment there\u2019s silence in the hall. I don\u2019t know what to say. I feel totally thrown.</p><p>\u201cBecky...I don\u2019t know what wrong end of what stick you\u2019ve got hold of.\u201d Luke exhales long and hard. \u201cThere\u2019s been some trouble at work and I\u2019ve been trying to shield you from it. But I\u2019m not having an affair. With Venetia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she told me you were.\u201d</p><p>Luke looks astounded. \u201cShe can\u2019t have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did! She said you were leaving me for her. She said\u2014\u201d I bite my lip. It\u2019s too painful to remember everything Venetia said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is just...bloody...madness.\u201d Luke shakes his head in exasperation. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of conversation you had with Venetia, what kind of...crossed wires or misinformation....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying nothing\u2019s been going on between you? Nothing at all?\u201d</p><p>Luke clutches his hair, closing his eyes briefly. \u201cWhy would you think anything was going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I stare up at him. \u201cLuke, are you serious? Where do I start? All those times you\u2019ve gone out with her, just you and her. All those texts in Latin, which you wouldn\u2019t tell me about. And everyone was so weird toward me at the office...and I saw you sitting together on her desk...and you lied, the night of the Finance Awards....\u201d My voice is starting to wobble. \u201cI knew you weren\u2019t really there....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI lied because I didn\u2019t want to worry you!\u201d Luke sounds more fraught and angry than I\u2019ve ever heard him. \u201cMy staff were weird to you at the office because I\u2019d sent round an e-mail saying that nobody, but nobody, was to mention the company problems to you. On pain of being fired. Becky...I\u2019ve been trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>I have a sudden flashback to him, sitting at his desk in the gloom, his brow creased. That was weeks ago. He\u2019s been moody and absent ever since.</p><p>But then why would Venetia have said...</p><p>Why would she have...</p><p>\u201cShe told me you were leaving me for her.\u201d My voice is really jumping around now. \u201cShe said you\u2019d still want to visit the baby.\u201d I give a sudden sob.</p> <p>\u201cLeaving you? Becky, come here.\u201d Luke wraps his arms tightly around me, and all of a sudden I\u2019m burying my head in his chest, tears streaming into his shirt. \u201cI love you,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cI\u2019m never leaving you. Or little Birkin.\u201d</p><p>How did he...</p><p>Oh. He must have found my list of names.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Armageddon now,\u201d I correct him, through my snuffles. \u201cOr Pomegranate. That\u2019s what I told your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I hope she passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly.\u201d I try to smile, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s all still too raw. I\u2019ve had weeks and weeks of worrying and imagining and fearing the worst. I can\u2019t just snap my fingers and act normal again.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I was going to be a single mother.\u201d I gulp. \u201cI thought you loved her. I didn\u2019t know why you were being so weird. It\u2019s been awful. If you had problems at work you should have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I should.\u201d He\u2019s silent for a bit, resting his chin on my head. \u201cTo be honest, Becky...it\u2019s been nice to have somewhere to escape from it all.\u201d</p><p>I lift my head up and study Luke. He looks grim. And tired. It suddenly hits me. He looks really, really tired.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s been going on?\u201d I wipe my face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble? You have to tell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArcodas,\u201d he says shortly.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought it was all going so well,\u201d I say, confused. \u201cI thought that\u2019s why you were opening the new offices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d never fucking pitched for them.\u201d He sounds so bleak, I feel a thud of dread.</p><p>\u201cLuke...what\u2019s happened?\u201d I say nervously. \u201cLet\u2019s sit down.\u201d I make my way into Fabia\u2019s sitting room and sink into a squashy suede sofa.</p> <p>\u201cA load of things,\u201d says Luke, following me. He raises his eyebrows briefly at the B and L cushions, then sits down, resting his head in his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I want to know everything. From the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare.\u201d He turns his face toward me. \u201cThe main nightmare being a harassment claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarassment?\u201d I gape at him.</p><p>\u201cSally-Ann Davies. Remember her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I nod. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Sally-Ann has worked for the company ever since I\u2019ve known Luke. She\u2019s quite reserved, but really sweet and reliable.</p><p>\u201cThere were...incidents between her and Iain. She says he came on to her in an aggressive, unpleasant manner. She made a complaint. Which he laughed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, how awful,\u201d I breathe. \u201cSo...what did you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe Sally-Ann one hundred percent.\u201d Luke sounds totally resolute.</p><p>I\u2019m silent. My mind has flashed back to the manila file from Dave Sharpness\u2019s office. The dossier he collected on Iain. All those hushed-up cases.</p><p>Should I tell Luke?</p><p>No. Not unless I have to. It would raise so many awkward questions, and he might get angry when he hears what I did. Anyway, I shredded everything in the file, so I haven\u2019t even got the evidence anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cI\u2019d believe her too.

His opinion of women is pretty unspeakable.\u201d</p><p>I frown, trying to think back over the past weeks. \u201cWas that when you couldn\u2019t come to my prenatal class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the start of it, yes.\u201d He massages his brow. \u201cBecky, I couldn\u2019t tell you. Believe me, I wanted to, but I knew how upset you\u2019d get. And Venetia had just told me you needed to stay calm.\u201d</p> <p>Stay calm. Yup, that plan really worked.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally-Ann was incredibly generous-spirited about it. She said she wouldn\u2019t take it any further if she could be moved to another account. Which obviously we did. But the whole company was upset by it.\u201d He sighs. \u201cTo be honest, Arcodas have been difficult to work with, right from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIain\u2019s awful, isn\u2019t he?\u201d I say bluntly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just him.\u201d Luke shakes his head. \u201cThe whole ethos. They\u2019re bullies, all of them.\u201d A shadow passes over his face. \u201cAnd now...it\u2019s happened again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith Sally-Ann?\u201d</p><p>Luke shakes his head. \u201cAmy Hill, one of our assistants, was reduced to tears by another of the Arcodas team.

Meanwhile, all my staff are up in arms. They\u2019re writing me e-mails of protest, refusing to touch the Arcodas account, threatening to resign....\u201d Luke thrusts his hands through his hair, looking totally beleaguered. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>I subside back onto Fabia\u2019s sofa, trying to take all this in. I can\u2019t believe Luke has been walking around with all of this to worry about for so long. Saying nothing. Trying to protect me.</p><p>Not having an affair after all.</p><p>I run my eyes over his averted face. He could still be lying, it occurs to me. Even if the stuff about Arcodas is true. He could still be seeing Venetia. He\u2019s just playing along to keep you happy runs through my mind for the thousandth time.</p><p>\u201cLuke, please,\u201d I say in a rush. \u201cPlease. Tell me the truth once and for all. Are you seeing her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke turns to me, astounded. \u201cBecky, I thought we\u2019d dealt with this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you were acting.\u201d I twist my fingers miserably. \u201cAll this could just be put on. To...to keep me happy.\u201d</p> <p>Luke turns to face me square-on and takes both my hands in his, tight.</p><p>\u201cBecky, we\u2019re not seeing each other. Nothing is going on. I don\u2019t know how I can put it any more plainly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did she say you were seeing each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Luke sounds at the end of his rope. \u201cI honestly have no idea what she was talking about. Look, Becky, you\u2019re just going to have to trust me. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. The truth is, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I can trust him anymore.</p><p>\u201cI want a cup of tea,\u201d I mumble at last, and get up.</p><p>I thought everything would be better when we\u2019d talked, when we\u2019d got it all out in the open. But here it is, out in the open like an exhibit on a podium. And I still don\u2019t know what to believe. Without meeting Luke\u2019s eye, I head into the kitchen and start opening all Fabia\u2019s hand-built cupboards, looking for the tea. God, this is supposed to be my house. I\u2019m supposed to know where the tea is.</p><p>\u201cTry that one,\u201d says Luke, as I open a cupboard filled with saucepans and bang it shut again, except it won\u2019t bang because it\u2019s so expensive and well-made. \u201cThe corner cupboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I open it and locate a box of tea bags. I put them on the counter and lean against it, all energy gone. Meanwhile Luke has headed over to the huge glass doors at the back and is staring out at the garden, his shoulders rigid.</p><p>This isn\u2019t how I planned our reunion. Not one bit.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about Arcodas?\u201d I say at last, twisting the string of a tea bag. \u201cYou can\u2019t fire Amy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not going to fire Amy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what are your options?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOption one: I patch things over,\u201d says Luke without moving his head. \u201cTake the flak, smooth down some feathers, and carry on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil it happens again,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Luke turns with a grim little nod. \u201cOption two: I call a meeting with Arcodas. Tell them straight, I\u2019m not having my staff bullied. Get an apology for Amy. Make them see reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd option three?\u201d I can tell there\u2019s an option three from his expression.</p><p>\u201cOption three: if they won\u2019t cooperate\u201d\u2014he pauses for a long time\u2014\u201cwe refuse to work for them. Withdraw from the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that be possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be possible.\u201d He presses the heels of his hands into his eyes and rubs them. \u201cIt would be fucking expensive. There\u2019s a penalty if we quit within the first year. Plus we\u2019ve opened Europe-wide offices on the strength of this contract. It was supposed to be our brave new world. Our gateway to bigger and better things.\u201d</p> <p>I can hear the heavy disappointment in his voice. And suddenly I want to throw my arms around him tight. It was so exciting when Brandon Communications won the Arcodas pitch. They worked so hard to get it. It seemed like such a prize.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you going to do?\u201d I ask tentatively.</p><p>Luke has picked up an antique nutcracker from a side table. He starts rotating the handle, his face set.</p><p>\u201cOr else I could tell my staff they just have to get on with it. A few might leave, but the others would knuckle down. People need jobs. They\u2019ll put up with shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have a miserable company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA miserable, profitable company.\u201d His voice has an edge which I don\u2019t like. \u201cWe\u2019re in this to make money, remember?\u201d</p> <p>The baby suddenly kicks me hard inside and I wince. Everything\u2019s so...achy-painy. Me. Luke. The whole horrible situation.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want that,\u201d I say.</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t move a muscle. His face is flint-hard. Anyone watching would think he didn\u2019t agree or hadn\u2019t heard or didn\u2019t care. But I know what\u2019s inside his head. He loves his company. He loves it when it\u2019s thriving and successful and happy.</p><p>\u201cLuke, the staff at Brandon C...\u201d I take a step toward him. \u201cThey\u2019re your family. They\u2019ve been loyal to you all these years. Think how you\u2019d feel if Amy was your daughter. You\u2019d want her employer to take a stand. I mean...you\u2019re your own boss! The whole point is, you don\u2019t have to work with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to them.\u201d Luke\u2019s eyes are still focused downward. \u201cI\u2019ll have it out. Maybe we can make it all work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I nod, trying to sound more hopeful than I feel.</p><p>Suddenly Luke puts the nutcracker back on the table and looks up. \u201cBecky, if I end up pulling out of the Arcodas deal...we won\u2019t be squillionaires. You understand that.\u201d</p><p>I feel a pang. It was pretty exciting when it was all going so well and we were going to conquer the world and fly around in private jets. And I was planning to buy these amazing \u00a31,000 stiletto boots from Vivienne Westwood.</p> <p>Anyway. There\u2019s a \u00a350 version in Topshop. I\u2019ll get those instead.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not right now.\u201d I lift my chin defiantly. \u201cBut we will be when you pull off your next big deal. And in the meantime\u201d\u2014I look around the fabulous designer kitchen\u2014\u201cwe\u2019re doing pretty well. We can buy an island some other year.\u201d I think for a moment. \u201cActually, islands are totally over. We didn\u2019t want one.\u201d</p><p>Luke stares at me for a moment, then gives a sudden snort of laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou know something, Becky Bloomwood? You are going to be one hell of a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I color, totally taken by surprise. \u201cReally? In a good way?\u201d</p><p>Luke comes across the kitchen and rests his hands gently on my bump. \u201cThis little person is very lucky,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cExcept I don\u2019t know any nursery rhymes,\u201d I say, a bit gloomy. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to get it off to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNursery rhymes are overrated,\u201d says Luke confidently. \u201cI\u2019ll read it pieces from the FT. That\u2019ll send it off.\u201d</p><p>We both gaze down at my swollen tummy for a while. I still can\u2019t quite get my head round the fact that there\u2019s a baby inside my body. Which has got to come out...somehow.</p><p>OK, let\u2019s not go there. There\u2019s still time for them to invent something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a while Luke raises his head. He has a strange, unreadable expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cSo...tell me, Becky,\u201d he says lightly. \u201cIs it Armageddon or Pomegranate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I look at him, confused.</p><p>\u201cThis morning, when I got home, I was trying to work out where you\u2019d gone. I rooted around in your drawers for clues....\u201d He hesitates. \u201cAnd I came across that gender predictor test. You\u2019ve found out, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>My heart gives an almighty thud. Shit. I should have thrown the test away. I\u2019m so stupid.</p><p>Luke\u2019s smiling, but I can see a trace of hurt in his eyes. And suddenly I feel really terrible. I don\u2019t know how I could have been planning to leave Luke out of such an important moment. I don\u2019t even quite know anymore why I was so desperate to find out the sex. Who cares?</p><p>I put one of my hands on his and squeeze it. \u201cActually, Luke...I didn\u2019t do the test. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s rueful expression doesn\u2019t change.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Becky. Just tell me. If only one of us is going to be surprised, there doesn\u2019t seem much point in waiting anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do the test!\u201d I insist. \u201cHonestly! It was going to take too long and you had to have an injection....\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t believe me. I can see it from his face. We\u2019ll be in the delivery room and they\u2019ll say \u201cIt\u2019s a boy!\u201d or whatever, and all he\u2019ll think is \u201cBecky already knew.\u201d</p><p>A lump suddenly rises in my throat. I don\u2019t want it to be like that. I want us to find out together.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I didn\u2019t find out,\u201d I say desperately, tears stinging my eyes. \u201cI really, honestly didn\u2019t! I wouldn\u2019t lie to you. You have to believe me. It\u2019s going to be an amazing...wonderful...surprise. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m gazing up at him, my whole body tense, my hands clutching my skirt. Luke\u2019s eyes are scanning my face.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d His brow finally relaxes. \u201cOK. I believe you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I believe you too.\u201d The words fall out of my mouth with no warning.</p><p>But now I\u2019ve said them, I realize they\u2019re true. I could demand more proof that Luke\u2019s not seeing Venetia. I could get him followed again. I could be totally paranoid and miserable forever.</p><p>In the end, you have to choose whether or not to trust someone. And I do choose to trust him. I do.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Luke draws me in for a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, sweetheart. It\u2019s all going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>After a while I pull away from Luke. I take a deep breath, trying to compose myself, and get down a couple of mugs. Then I turn to him.</p><p>\u201cLuke, why did Venetia say you were having an affair if you weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Luke looks mystified. \u201cAre you absolutely sure that\u2019s what she meant? You couldn\u2019t have misinterpreted what she was saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I retort crossly. \u201cI\u2019m not that stupid! It was totally obvious what she meant.\u201d I rip off a piece of Fabia\u2019s paper towels and blow my nose on it. \u201cAnd just so you know, I\u2019m not having our baby delivered by her. Or going to any of her stupid tea parties.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d Luke nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can go back to Dr. Braine. You know, he\u2019s e-mailed me a couple of times, just to see how you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s so sweet of him....\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rings and I start. It\u2019s them. I\u2019d almost half kind-of forgotten.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Vogue!\u201d I say in agitation. \u201cThe whole reason I\u2019m here! For the photo shoot!\u201d</p><p>I hurry into the hall, and as I see my reflection in the mirror I feel a jerk of dismay. My face is blotchy; my eyes are all bloodshot and puffy; my smile is strained. I can\u2019t remember my way round the house. I\u2019ve totally forgotten all my yummy quotes. I can\u2019t even remember who my underpants are by. I can\u2019t do it.</p><p>The doorbell rings again, twice.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer?\u201d Luke has followed me into the hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to cancel!\u201d Woefully, I turn to face him. \u201cLook at me. I\u2019m a mess! I can\u2019t be in Vogue like this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be wonderful,\u201d he replies firmly, and strides to the front door.</p><p>\u201cThey think it\u2019s our house!\u201d I hiss after him in panic. \u201cI told them we live here.\u201d</p><p>Luke shoots me a what-do-you-take-me-for? glance over his shoulder, and swings open the door.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d he says, in his most confident, head-of-a-huge-important-company voice. \u201cWelcome to our home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Makeup artists should hereby get the Nobel Prize for adding to human happiness. And so should hairdressers.</p><p>And so should Luke.</p><p>It\u2019s three hours later and the shoot is going brilliantly. Luke totally charmed all the Vogue people as soon as they arrived, and was completely convincing as we showed them around the house. They totally think we live here!</p><p>I feel like a different person. I certainly look like a different person. My blotchiness has been totally covered up, and the makeup artist was really sweet about it. She said she\u2019d seen far worse and at least I wasn\u2019t off my head on coke. Or six hours late. And at least I hadn\u2019t brought some stupid yappy dog. (I get the feeling she\u2019s not that keen on models.)</p> <p>My hair looks totally fab and shiny, and they brought the most amazing clothes for me to wear, all in a trailer which they\u2019ve parked outside. And now I\u2019m standing on the sweeping staircase in a Missoni dress, beaming as the camera clicks, feeling just like Claudia Schiffer or someone.</p><p>And Luke is standing at the bottom of the staircase, smiling encouragingly up at me. He\u2019s been here all along. He canceled all the rest of his morning meetings, and took part in the interview and everything. He said having a baby put other things into perspective and he thought fatherhood would change him as a person. He said he thought I was more beautiful right now than he\u2019d ever seen me (which is a total lie, but still). He said...</p><p>Anyway. He said loads of nice things. And he knew who painted the picture above the fireplace in the sitting room when they asked. He\u2019s brilliant!</p><p>\u201cShall we move outside now?\u201d The photographer looks questioningly at Martha.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice idea.\u201d She nods, and I walk down the stairs, carefully holding up my dress.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I could wear the Oscar de la Renta dress?\u201d</p><p>The stylist brought the most amazing purple evening dress and cloak, which was apparently made for some pregnant movie star to wear to a premiere but she never did. I just have to try it on.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019ll look spectacular against the grass.\u201d Martha heads to the back of the hall and squints through the glass doors. \u201cWhat an amazing garden! Did you landscape it yourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I glance at Luke.</p><p>\u201cWe hired a gardening company, obviously,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the concept was all ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d I nod. \u201cOur inspiration was a kind of Zen...meets...urban structure....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe positioning of the trees was crucial to the project,\u201d Luke adds. \u201cWe had them moved at least three times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Martha nods intelligently and scribbles in her notebook. \u201cYou\u2019re real perfectionists!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just care about design,\u201d Luke says seriously. He shoots me a quick wink and I try not to giggle.</p><p>\u201cSo, you must be looking forward to seeing your little child out there on the lawn.\u201d She looks up with a smile. \u201cLearning to crawl...and walk...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Luke takes my hand. \u201cWe certainly are.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to add something, but my stomach suddenly tightens, like someone squeezed it with both hands. It\u2019s been doing it for a while, now that I think about it \u2014 but that time was kind of stronger. \u201cOoh,\u201d I say, before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke looks alert.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cSo, shall I put on the cloak?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get your makeup touched up,\u201d says Martha. \u201cAnd shall we do a sandwich run?\u201d</p><p>I head across the hall, reach the front door, and stop. My stomach just tightened up again. It\u2019s unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Luke is watching me. \u201cBecky, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>OK. Don\u2019t panic.</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I say as calmly as I can, \u201cI think I\u2019m in labor. It\u2019s been going on for a while now.\u201d</p><p>My stomach tightens again, and I start shallow panting, just like Noura said in that lesson. God, it\u2019s amazing how I\u2019m coping instinctively.</p><p>\u201cA while?\u201d Luke strides over to me, looking alarmed. \u201cHow long, exactly?\u201d</p><p>I think back to when I first became aware of the sensations. \u201cAbout five hours? Which means I\u2019m probably...five centimeters dilated, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive centimeters dilated?\u201d Luke stares at me. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I\u2019m halfway there.\u201d My voice suddenly trembles with excitement. \u201cIt means we\u2019re going to have a baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d Luke whips out his mobile phone and jabs at it. \u201cHello? Ambulance service, please.

But it\u2019s not due yet, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for three weeks,\u201d says Luke. \u201cIt must be early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Becky?\u201d Martha peers at me. \u201cDo you need drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m using natural methods,\u201d I gasp, gripping my necklace. \u201cThis is an ancient Maori birthing stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d says Martha, scribbling. \u201cCan you spell Maori?\u201d</p> <p>My stomach tightens again and I clutch the stone harder. Even with the pain, I can\u2019t help feeling exhilarated. They\u2019re right, birth is an amazing experience. I feel as if my whole body is working in harmony, as if this is what it was designed to do all along.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a bag packed?\u201d says Martha, watching me in alarm. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to have a bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a suitcase,\u201d I say breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Luke, snapping his phone shut. \u201cLet\u2019s get it. Quick. Where is it? And your hospital notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d I break off. It\u2019s all at home. Our real home.</p><p>\u201cUm...it\u2019s in the bedroom. By the dressing table.\u201d I look at him in slight desperation. Luke\u2019s eyes snap with sudden understanding.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says. \u201cWell...I\u2019m sure we can make a stop-off if we need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll nip up and get it for you,\u201d says Martha helpfully. \u201cWhich side of the dressing table is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean...um...actually, there it is!\u201d I point at a Mulberry holdall that I\u2019ve suddenly spotted in the hall cupboard. \u201cI forgot, I put it there so as to be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Luke drags it out of the cupboard, with some effort, and a tennis ball falls out of it.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you taking tennis balls to hospital?\u201d asks Martha, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cFor...er...massage. Oh God...\u201d I grip the Maori stone tightly and breathe deeply.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK, Becky?\u201d says Luke, looking anxious. \u201cIt seems to be getting worse.\u201d He looks at his watch. \u201cWhere\u2019s this bloody ambulance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting stronger.\u201d I manage to nod through the pain. \u201cI should think I\u2019m probably about six or seven centimeters dilated by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, the ambulance is here.\u201d The photographer pokes his head through the front door. \u201cIt\u2019s just pulling up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get going.\u201d Luke holds out his arm to me. \u201cAre you able to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Just about.\u201d</p><p>We head out the front door and pause on the top step. The ambulance is blocking the whole road, its blue light flashing round and round. I can see a few people watching, on the other side of the street.</p><p>This is it. When I come out of hospital...I\u2019ll have a baby!</p><p>\u201cGood luck!\u201d calls Martha. \u201cHope it all goes well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky...I love you.\u201d Luke squeezes my arm tight. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you. You\u2019re doing amazingly! You\u2019re so calm, so composed....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just feels totally natural,\u201d I say with a kind of humble awe, like Patrick Swayze telling Demi Moore what heaven is like at the end of Ghost. \u201cIt\u2019s painful...but it\u2019s beautiful too.\u201d</p><p>Two paramedics have got out of the back of the ambulance and are coming toward me.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Luke glances down at me.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I take a deep breath and start walking down the steps. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>HUH. I DON\u2019T BELIEVE IT, I wasn\u2019t in labor after all. I don\u2019t have a baby or anything.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t make any sense, in fact I still think they might have been wrong. I had all the symptoms! The regular contractions, and the back pain (well, a slight achy feeling), just like in the book. But they sent me home and said I wasn\u2019t in labor or prelabor or even approaching labor. They said they weren\u2019t real labor pains.</p><p>It was all a bit embarrassing. Especially when I asked for the epidural and they laughed. They didn\u2019t have to laugh. Or phone up their friends and tell them. I heard that midwife, even though she was whispering. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s also made me rethink this whole giving-birth thing. I mean, if that wasn\u2019t the real thing...what on earth is the real thing like? So after we got back from the hospital I had a long, frank talk with Luke. I said I\u2019d given it some careful thought and come to the conclusion that I couldn\u2019t do labor, and we were going to have to find some other solution.</p><p>He was really sweet about it, and didn\u2019t just say \u201cLove, you\u2019ll be fine\u201d (like that stupid midwife phone advisory service). He said I should line up every form of pain relief I could, never mind about the cost. So I\u2019ve hired a reflexologist, a hot-stone-massage person, an aromatherapist, an acupuncturist, a homeopath, and a doula. Plus I\u2019ve taken to phoning the hospital every day, just to make sure their anesthetists haven\u2019t all gone ill or been trapped in a cupboard or anything.</p><p>And I chucked out that stupid birthing stone. I always thought it was rubbish.</p><p>It\u2019s now a week later, and nothing\u2019s happened since, except I\u2019m bigger and more lumbery than ever. We went to see Dr. Braine yesterday, and he said everything seemed just fine and the baby had turned into the right position, which was good news. Hmph. Good news for the baby, maybe. Not for me. I can hardly walk anymore, let alone sleep. Last night I woke up at three A.M. and felt so uncomfortable I couldn\u2019t even lie in bed, so I went and watched this program on cable called True-Life Births \u2014 When Trauma Goes Bad.</p> <p>Which was maybe a mistake, in hindsight. But luckily Luke was awake too, and he made me a cup of hot chocolate to calm me down and said it was really unlikely we\u2019d ever be stuck in a snowdrift with twins about to be born and no doctors for two hundred miles. And at least now we knew what to do if we were.</p><p>Luke isn\u2019t sleeping well either at the moment, and it\u2019s all because of the Arcodas situation. He\u2019s been talking to his lawyers every day, and having consultations with his staff, and has endlessly tried to set up a meeting with the Arcodas senior team to have it all out. But Iain has canceled twice with no notice \u2014 and then he disappeared off on some trip. So nothing\u2019s resolved yet, and the longer it all goes on, the tenser Luke gets. It\u2019s like we\u2019re both on some ticking fuse, just...waiting.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been good at waiting. For babies, or phone calls, or sample sales...or anything.</p><p>The only positive thing right now is that Luke and I are about a million times closer than we have been for months. We\u2019ve talked about everything over the past week. His company, plans for the future...one night we even got out all the honeymoon photos and looked through them again.</p><p>We\u2019ve talked about everything...except Venetia.</p> <p>I tried. I tried to tell him what she was really like, over supper, after we got back from the hospital that day. But Luke was just incredulous. He said he still couldn\u2019t believe that Venetia said she and he were having an affair. He said they were genuinely just old friends \u2014 and maybe I\u2019d made a mistake or misinterpreted what she meant.</p><p>Which made me want to hurl my plate at the wall and shout, \u201cHow stupid do you think I am?\u201d But I didn\u2019t. It would have turned into a big row, and I really didn\u2019t want to ruin the evening.</p><p>And I haven\u2019t pushed the subject since then. Luke\u2019s so hassled, I can\u2019t bring myself to. As he says, we never have to see Venetia again if we don\u2019t want to. He\u2019s given her notice as a PR client, Dr. Braine will deliver the baby, and Luke\u2019s promised he won\u2019t make any plans to meet up with her. As far as he\u2019s concerned, it\u2019s a brief chapter of our life which has closed.</p><p>Only...I can\u2019t close it. Deep down, I\u2019m still obsessed. I didn\u2019t make a mistake. She did say that she and Luke were having an affair. She nearly ruined our marriage \u2014 and now she\u2019s just getting away with it.</p><p>If I could just see her...if I could tell her what I think of her....</p><p>\u201cBex, you\u2019re grinding your teeth again,\u201d says Suze patiently. \u201cStop it.\u201d She arrived half an hour ago, laden with homemade Christmas presents from Ernie\u2019s school fair. Now she brings over a cup of raspberry leaf tea and an iced Santa Claus cookie and puts them down on the counter. \u201cYou have to stop stressing about Venetia. It\u2019s not good for the baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right for you! You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. No one made you wear hideous stockings and said you don\u2019t have a marriage anymore and your husband was leaving you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Bex.\u201d Suze sighs. \u201cWhatever Venetia said...Whether she did say that or not...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did!\u201d I look up, indignant. \u201cThat\u2019s what she said, word for word!

But you know, when you\u2019re pregnant, things can seem worse than they really are.... You can overreact....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not overreacting! She tried to steal my husband! What, you think I\u2019m deluded? You think I made it all up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Suze hastily. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. Maybe she did go after him. But...she didn\u2019t get him, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo. Just let it go. You\u2019re having a baby, Bex. That\u2019s the important thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She looks so anxious, I can\u2019t tell her my secret fantasy of bursting into the Holistic Birth Center unannounced and telling everyone exactly what a deceitful home-wrecker Venetia Carter really is.</p><p>Then how holistic would she look?</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI\u2019m letting it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Suze pats my arm. \u201cSo, what time do we have to leave?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m going back to The Look today, even though I\u2019m officially now on maternity leave, because they\u2019re opening the waiting list for the new Danny Kovitz line. Danny is going to be there from twelve noon, signing Tshirts for people who register, and the store has already had hundreds of inquiries!</p><p>The whole thing has suddenly become huge news \u2014 helped by Danny being photographed the other night in a clinch with the new guy in Coronation Street. All the papers have suddenly taken up the story and we\u2019ve had loads of publicity. Danny was even on Morning Coffee this morning, assessing spring fashions on the sofa (he said all the outfits were hideous, which they loved) and telling everyone to come to The Look.</p><p>Ha! And it was all my idea to get him involved.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in a few minutes,\u201d I say, glancing at my watch. \u201cThere\u2019s no rush. They can\u2019t exactly fire me for being late, can they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not....\u201d Suze edges back to the sink, past our brand-new Warrior pushchair, which is in the corner, still in its packaging. There wasn\u2019t room for it in the nursery, and the hall is cluttered with a Bugaboo (they were on special offer) and this cool three-wheeler which has an integrated car seat. \u201cBex, how many prams did you order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few,\u201d I say vaguely.</p> <p>\u201cBut where are you going to keep them all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I assure her. \u201cI\u2019m having a special room for them in the new house. I\u2019ll call it the Pram Room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Pram Room?\u201d Suze stares at me. \u201cYou\u2019re having a Shoe Room and a Pram Room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? People don\u2019t have enough different rooms. I might have a Handbag Room too. Just a small one...\u201d I take a sip of raspberry leaf tea, which according to Suze helps speed up labor, and wince at the revolting taste.</p><p>\u201cOoh, what was that?\u201d says Suze, alert. \u201cDid you feel a twinge?\u201d</p><p>Honestly. This is the third time she\u2019s asked about twinges since she arrived this morning.</p><p>\u201cSuze, it\u2019s not due for another two weeks,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything!\u201d says Suze. \u201cThose dates are all a conspiracy by doctors.\u201d She studies me closely. \u201cDo you feel like sweeping the floor or cleaning out the fridge?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe fridge is clean!\u201d I say, a bit offended.</p><p>\u201cNo, you dope!\u201d says Suze. \u201cIt\u2019s the nesting instinct. When the twins were due I suddenly got this mania for ironing Tarkie\u2019s shirts. And Lulu always starts vacuuming the whole house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVacuuming?\u201d I look at her dubiously. I can\u2019t imagine having an urge to vacuum.</p><p>\u201cTotally! Loads of women scrub the floor\u2014\u201d She breaks off as the buzzer sounds, and picks up the entry phone. \u201cHello, the Brandon residence!\u201d She listens for a moment, then presses the entry button. \u201cIt\u2019s a delivery. Are you expecting something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, yes!\u201d I put my cup down. \u201cIt\u2019ll be my Christmas things!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresents?\u201d Suze brightens. \u201cIs there one for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot presents,\u201d I explain. \u201cGorgeous decorations. It was so weird \u2014 I had this sudden urge yesterday, like I had to get Christmas all sorted before I had the baby. So I\u2019ve ordered new angels for the tree, and an Advent candle, and this gorgeous nativity scene....\u201d I take a bite of cookie and munch it. \u201cI\u2019ve got it all planned for the new house. We\u2019ll have a huge Christmas tree in the hall, and garlands everywhere, and gingerbread men which we can put on red ribbons....\u201d</p><p>The doorbell sounds and I head to the door. I open it to see two men holding massive cardboard boxes, plus a huge bulky parcel which must be the life-size models of Mary and Joseph. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBlimey!\u201d says Suze, staring at them. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a Christmas Decoration Room too.\u201d</p><p>Hey.

Suze is looking from me to the boxes and back again with a strange, animated expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, this is it,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re nesting.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her. \u201cBut...I haven\u2019t cleaned anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery woman\u2019s different! Maybe you don\u2019t clean \u2014 you order things from catalogs! Was it like...this sudden really strong desire which you couldn\u2019t fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I can\u2019t help a gasp of recognition. \u201cExactly! The catalog came through the door...and I just had to order from it. I couldn\u2019t stop myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go!\u201d Suze says, satisfied. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of nature\u2019s grand plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I breathe, totally awestruck by my own body. I wasn\u2019t shopping, I was nesting! I must tell Luke.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you really don\u2019t feel like cleaning anything?\u201d Suze adds curiously. \u201cOr tidying up?\u201d</p><p>I prod my feelings experimentally. \u201cI don\u2019t think so....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel like washing up those plates?\u201d Suze gestures to the breakfast things in the sink.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say definitely. \u201cNo urge at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just shows.\u201d Suze shakes her head in wonderment. \u201cEvery pregnancy is different.\u201d</p><p>A new thought has suddenly struck me. \u201cHey, Suze, if I\u2019m nesting, maybe I\u2019ll have the baby soon! Like this afternoon!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d says Suze in dismay. \u201cNot before your shower!\u201d Immediately she claps her hand over her mouth.</p><p>Shower? Does she mean...baby shower?</p><p>\u201cAre you throwing me a baby shower!\u201d I can\u2019t help beaming with excitement.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Suze at once. \u201cI...that\u2019s not...it wasn\u2019t...I\u2019m not...\u201d</p><p>Her face has turned bright pink and she\u2019s twisting one leg around the other. Suze is such a hopeless liar.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, OK,\u201d she says in a rush. \u201cBut it\u2019s a surprise. I\u2019m not going to tell you when it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it today?\u201d I say at once. \u201cI bet it\u2019s today!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you!\u201d she says, all flustered. \u201cStop talking about it. Pretend I never said anything. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We take a taxi to The Look, and as we draw near I cannot believe my eyes. This is better than I could have hoped for, in a million years.</p><p>There are queues of people snaking round the block as far as I can see. There must be hundreds of them, mostly girls in cool-looking outfits, chattering in groups or on mobile phones. Everyone\u2019s holding a helium balloon with THE LOOK \u2014 DANNY KOVITZ printed on it, and music is playing from speakers, and one of the girls from PR is giving out bottles of Diet Coke and \u201cDanny Kovitz\u201d lollies.</p><p>The whole atmosphere is like a party. A TV crew from London Tonight is filming the scene and a radio presenter is interviewing the girl at the head of the queue, and as we get out I can see a woman introducing herself to a young, rangy girl as a scout from Models One.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Suze breathes beside me.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I\u2019m trying to look cool, but a huge grin is spreading across my face. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go inside!\u201d</p><p>We fight our way to the head of the queue, and I show my pass to the security guard. As he opens the door to let us in, I can feel the swell of girls pushing forward behind me.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that girl?\u201d I can hear furious voices behind me demanding. \u201cShe just shoved her way in! Why does she get to queue-barge just because she\u2019s pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Oops. Maybe we should have gone in a side door.</p><p>Inside, there\u2019s another queue of excited, chattering girls. It winds through accessories, past huge screens showing Danny\u2019s latest catwalk collection, up to a mirrored, art deco table behind which Danny is sitting on a huge throne-like chair. Above him a banner reads EXCLUSIVE\u2014 MEET DANNY KOVITZ! and in front of him three teenage girls in indentikit military jackets and ponytails are gawking at him in total awe as he signs plain white Tshirts for them. He meets my eye and winks.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mouth back, and blow him a kiss. He is a total, one hundred percent star. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Plus, I know he will be loving all this.</p><p>A small distance from the table, Eric is being interviewed by another TV crew, and as I approach I can hear him speaking.</p><p>\u201cI did always feel strongly that The Look should be considering joint design initiatives...\u201d he\u2019s saying importantly. Then suddenly he notices me watching. He breaks off, flushing slightly. \u201cAhem. Let me introduce Rebecca Brandon, our head of Personal Shopping, who originated the idea....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there!\u201d I head over to the camera with a big, confident smile. \u201cEric and I worked as a team on this project and I think it heralds a new day for The Look. And all those people who laughed at us can eat their words.\u201d</p> <p>I give a few more sound bites to the interviewer, then make an excuse and leave Eric to it. To my astonishment, I\u2019ve just spotted Jess standing uncomfortably by the sunglasses, all on her own in jeans and a parka. I told her about the launch today, but I really wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d come along.</p><p>\u201cJess!\u201d I call out as I near her. \u201cYou made it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is incredible, Becky.\u201d Jess is looking around at the milling crowds. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I beam at her. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great? Have you seen all the TV crews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a guy from the Times outside,\u201d says Jess, nodding. \u201cAnd the Standard. The media coverage is going to be huge.\u201d She gives a little smile. \u201cBecky Brandon does it again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d I shrug, flushing. \u201cSo, how are things? How are preparations going for Chile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine.\u201d Jess heaves a sigh.</p><p>The thing with Jess is, it can be a bit hard to tell what mood she\u2019s in. She has a slightly gloomy air about her even when she\u2019s happy. (Which is just the way she is \u2014 I\u2019m not being mean or anything.) But as I look at her now, I think she\u2019s genuinely miserable.</p><p>\u201cJess...what\u2019s up?\u201d I put a hand on her arm. \u201cThings aren\u2019t fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Jess. \u201cThey\u2019re not.\u201d She looks up, and to my horror I see her eyes are shimmering. \u201cTom\u2019s disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisappeared?\u201d I say, aghast.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything. I didn\u2019t want to get you worried. But no one\u2019s seen him for three days. I think he\u2019s sulking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you leaving?\u201d</p><p>She nods and I feel a pang of anger at Tom. Why does he have to be such a self-obsessed flake?</p><p>\u201cHe sent one text to his parents to say he\u2019s safe. That\u2019s it. He could be anywhere. And Janice blames me, of course....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault! He\u2019s just a\u2014\u201d I stop myself.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any ideas where he might be, Becky?\u201d Her brow is all crinkled up. \u201cYou\u2019ve known him all your life.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, at a loss. Knowing Tom, he could have done anything. He could have gone to the tattoo parlor and asked them to tattoo Jess, Don\u2019t Go on his genitals.</p><p>\u201cLook...he\u2019ll turn up,\u201d I say at last. \u201cHe\u2019s not completely stupid. He\u2019s probably just gone off on a bender somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, Becky.\u201d I look up to see Jasmine coming toward us, holding an armful of scarves and hats, her cheeks pink with exertion.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jasmine! Isn\u2019t this amazing? What\u2019s it like upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhem.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cCustomers everywhere. Thank God we\u2019ve got the extra staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it cool?\u201d I beam, but Jasmine gives an unenthusiastic scowl.</p><p>\u201cI preferred it the way it was. We\u2019re all going to have to stay late tonight, you know. I haven\u2019t had a moment to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way, the shop may not go bust,\u201d I point out, but Jasmine doesn\u2019t look impressed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever...\u201d Her face suddenly snaps in shock. For a moment she\u2019s speechless. \u201cBecky...have you had your eyebrows done?\u201d</p><p>I wondered when she was going to notice!</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say casually. \u201cYes, I have. Nice, aren\u2019t they?\u201d I smooth one down with my finger.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t say,\u201d I tell her in tones of regret. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a secret. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s chin is set in fury. \u201cTell me where you went!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasmine!\u201d a girl is calling from the escalators. \u201cHave you got those scarves for the customer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found out where I go, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she spits. \u201cYou must have spied on me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow could I have done that?\u201d I say innocently, glancing at my reflection in a nearby mirror. My eyebrows do look pretty spectacular, though I say it myself. It\u2019s this Indian woman in Crouch End who does them. You go to her house and she threads and plucks and it takes forever. But it\u2019s worth it.</p><p>\u201cJasmine!\u201d the girl calls louder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d Jasmine shoots me a last, evil look.</p><p>\u201cBye then!\u201d I say cheerily. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the baby in to see you.\u201d</p> <p>Jess has been following the whole conversation, looking utterly bemused. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal about eyebrows?\u201d she says as Jasmine stalks off.</p><p>I survey Jess\u2019s eyebrows. They\u2019re brown and tufty and it\u2019s obvious that no pair of tweezers, brush, or eyebrow pencil has ever been near them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you one day,\u201d I say as my phone starts to ring. I take it out and flip it open. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d says Luke\u2019s voice in my ear. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I gather the launch is a huge success. It\u2019s just been on the news. Well done, darling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks! It is pretty amazing....\u201d I take a few steps away from Jess and turn in behind a rack of chiffon beaded shrugs. \u201cSo...what\u2019s the latest?\u201d I add in a lower voice.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had the meeting. I\u2019ve just come out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I clutch the phone tighter. \u201cAnd how did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh?\u201d I try to joke, but my heart sinks. I was so hoping Luke might be able to salvage the situation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever stood up to Iain before. He doesn\u2019t like it. Jesus, they\u2019re a bunch of unpleasant thugs.\u201d I can hear the anger in Luke\u2019s voice. \u201cThey think they own the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey practically do own the world,\u201d I point out.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t own me.\u201d Luke sounds resolute. \u201cOr my company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to the whole staff this afternoon.\u201d He pauses and I picture him at his desk in his shirtsleeves, tugging at his tie to loosen it. \u201cBut it looks like we\u2019re going to pull out of the deal. There\u2019s no way we can work with these people.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s it. The whole Arcodas-deal-conquering-the-world dream is ended. All Luke\u2019s hopes and plans dashed. I feel a growing, overwhelming fury at Iain Wheeler. How dare he treat people so badly and just get away with it? He needs someone to expose him.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I have to go,\u201d I say with sudden resolve. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later. We\u2019ll talk about it tonight.\u201d</p><p>I switch off, quickly search through my phone numbers, and speed-dial. After four rings there\u2019s a reply.</p><p>\u201cDave Sharpness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Mr. Sharpness,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s Becky Brandon here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Brandon!\u201d His hoarse voice lifts. \u201cWhat a delight to hear from you again! I hope you\u2019re keeping well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...fine, thanks.\u201d Two girls walk past, and I edge away to an empty spot behind a display of wigs.</p><p>\u201cIs there another matter we might be able to help you with?\u201d Dave Sharpness is saying. \u201cOur surveillance operatives have undergone full retraining, you\u2019ll be pleased to hear. And I can offer you a twenty percent discount on all investigations\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cut him off. \u201cThanks. What I need is that dossier you did for me. I shredded it. But now...I need it. Do you have a copy you could get to me?\u201d</p><p>Dave Sharpness gives his throaty chuckle.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brandon, if I could count the number of ladies I\u2019ve known who destroy some vital piece of evidence in a fit of pique. Then, when the divorce court looms, they\u2019re on the phone wondering if we keep copies....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting divorced!\u201d I say, trying to keep my patience. \u201cI need it...for a different reason. Do you have a copy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now. Ordinarily, Mrs. Brandon, I would have a copy to you within the hour. However...\u201d He pauses.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I say anxiously.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s been a slight mishap with the client secure storage facility.\u201d Dave Sharpness exhales. \u201cOur office manager, Wendy, and a pot of coffee. I won\u2019t go into details, but some of our archives are...well, to put it bluntly, a bit of a mess. We\u2019ve had to throw a lot of it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need it!

In the end I went for a pink wrap dress and suede boots. Plus I had my nails done last night, and bought some flowers and tidied the flat up a bit.</p><p>Best of all, I rooted through all my old boxes of stuff till I found this gorgeous card I once bought in New York. It has a little crib on it, with tiny presents dotted around \u2014 and glittery writing saying: Thanks for Throwing Me a Surprise Baby Shower, Friends! I knew I\u2019d have a need for it one day.</p><p>I also found a somber gray one saying, Sorry to Hear of Your Business Troubles, but I ripped that one up. Stupid card.</p><p>I haven\u2019t heard anything from Dave Sharpness yet. And I haven\u2019t mentioned it to Luke, even though I\u2019m bursting to. I don\u2019t want to raise his hopes until I know I have the evidence.</p><p>Luke\u2019s in the kitchen, drinking a strong black coffee before he leaves for work. I wander in and watch him for a moment. His jawline is tense and he\u2019s stirring sugar into his espresso cup. He does that only when he needs a five-thousand-volt boost of energy.</p><p>He notices me and gestures to the bar seat opposite. I heave myself up and rest my elbows on the granite.</p><p>\u201cBecky...we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d I say at once. \u201cYou know you are.\u201d</p><p>Luke nods. \u201cYou know, I already feel free. They were oppressing me. They were oppressing the whole company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! You don\u2019t need them, Luke! You don\u2019t need to run around after some arrogant, think-they-own-the-world company....\u201d</p><p>Luke lifts a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that. There\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d He pauses, stirring his coffee round and round, his face intent. \u201cArcodas haven\u2019t paid us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him, uncomprehending. \u201cYou mean...at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, right at the beginning. But nothing since. They owe us...well, a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they can\u2019t not pay you! People have to pay their bills! I mean, it\u2019s against the\u2014\u201d</p><p>I break off, reddening. I\u2019ve just remembered a few store card bills stuffed into my dressing table drawer, which I might not totally have paid yet.</p> <p>But that\u2019s different. I\u2019m not a huge multinational company, am I?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re notorious for this. We\u2019ve been chasing them, threatening them....\u201d Luke rubs his brow. \u201cWhile we were still doing business, we were confident we\u2019d get the money. Now, we may have to sue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, sue!\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cThey won\u2019t get away with it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut in the meantime...\u201d Luke lifts his cup, then puts it down again. \u201cBecky, to be honest, things aren\u2019t great. We expanded fast. Too fast, in hindsight. I have leases to pay, salaries to pay...we\u2019re hemorrhaging money. Until we manage to get back on our feet again, cash flow is going to be an issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I gulp. Hemorrhaging money. That\u2019s about the worst expression I\u2019ve ever heard. I have a sudden horrible vision of money pouring out of a great hole, day after day.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to borrow more than I thought to buy the house.\u201d Luke winces and takes a gulp of coffee. \u201cIt may delay things by a few weeks. I\u2019ll call the agent today. I should be able to square it with everyone.\u201d</p><p>He drains his cup and I notice a deep stress groove running between his brows which wasn\u2019t there before. Bastards. They gave that to him.</p><p>\u201cYou still did the right thing, Luke.\u201d I grab his hand and hold it tight. \u201cAnd if it means losing a bit of money, well...so what?\u201d</p><p>Just wait. Just you wait, Iain bloody Wheeler.</p><p>On impulse I get down off my stool, go round to Luke\u2019s side of the counter, and put my arms around him as best as I can. The baby\u2019s so huge it doesn\u2019t really have room to jump around anymore, but it\u2019s still squirming every now and then.</p><p>Hey, baby, I telegraph it silently. Don\u2019t come out till I\u2019ve had my baby shower, will you?</p> <p>I read the other day that a lot of mothers experience a genuine communication with their unborn babies, so I\u2019m trying to send it the odd little message of encouragement.</p><p>Tomorrow would be fine. Maybe lunchtime?</p><p>If you make it out in less than six hours, I\u2019ll give you a prize!</p><p>\u201cI should have listened to you, Becky.\u201d Luke\u2019s wry voice takes me by surprise. \u201cYou were the one protesting against Arcodas in the first place. And you never liked Iain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoathed him.\u201d I nod.</p><p>No, I\u2019m not telling you what the prize is. Wait and see.</p><p>There\u2019s a ring at the buzzer and he lifts the receiver. \u201cHi, bring it up.\u201d To me he says, \u201cIt\u2019s a package.\u201d</p><p>I stiffen. \u201cA courier package?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He shrugs his coat on. \u201cAre you expecting something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d I swallow. \u201cLuke...you might want to see this package. It could be important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not more bed linen, is it?\u201d Luke doesn\u2019t look enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s not bed linen! It\u2019s\u2014\u201d I break off as the doorbell rings. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d I hurry into the hall.</p><p>\u201cPackage for you. Please sign here,\u201d mumbles the courier as I open the door. I scribble on his electronic pad, grab the Jiffy bag, and turn to see Luke coming into the hall.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I have something pretty major here.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cSomething which could...change things. And you need to be open-minded about where I got it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you give that to Jess?\u201d Luke is squinting at the Jiffy bag.</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d I follow his gaze and for the first time see Miss Jessica Bertram typed on the label.</p><p>I feel a plunge of disappointment. It isn\u2019t from Dave Sharpness after all, it\u2019s some stupid thing for Jess.</p><p>\u201cHow come Jess is getting parcels delivered here?\u201d I say, unable to hide my frustration. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t live here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d Luke shrugs. \u201cSweetheart, I need to get going.\u201d He runs his eyes over my swollen stomach. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have my mobile on, and my pager.... If there are any signs at all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call.\u201d I nod, turning the Jiffy bag over in my fingers. \u201cSo, what am I supposed to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can give it to Jess\u2014\u201d Luke stops himself. \u201cSometime.

The overcasual way he said that...</p><p>\u201cLuke, you know, don\u2019t you?\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d His mouth twitches suspiciously as he picks up his briefcase.</p><p>\u201cYou know! About the...you know!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Luke looks as though he wants to laugh. \u201cBy the way, Becky, on a completely unrelated matter...could you possibly be in at around eleven this morning? We\u2019re expecting the gas man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not!\u201d I point at him, half-accusing, half-giggling. \u201cYou\u2019re setting me up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a wonderful time.\u201d Luke kisses me, and then he\u2019s out the door and I\u2019m left alone.</p><p>I linger in the hall for a bit, just looking at the door. I almost wish I\u2019d gone in with Luke today, to show moral support. He looks so stressed. And now he\u2019s got to face all his staff. And his finance people.</p><p>Hemorrhaging money. My stomach gives a nasty flip. No. Stop it. Don\u2019t think about it.</p> <p>There\u2019s still two hours to go before eleven, so I put on a Harry Potter DVD to distract myself, and open a box of chocolate snowmen, just because it\u2019s the festive season. It\u2019s got to the bit where Harry sees his dead parents in the mirror, and I\u2019m reaching for a tissue, when I happen to glance out the window \u2014 and see Suze. She\u2019s standing in front of our building, in the little car park next to the landscaped garden, and she\u2019s looking straight up at the window.</p><p>Immediately I duck down out of view. I hope she didn\u2019t spot me.</p><p>After a few moments I cautiously raise my head again and she\u2019s still standing there. Only she\u2019s been joined by Jess! In slight excitement I glance at my watch. Ten forty. Not long now!</p><p>The only thing is, they both seem quite perturbed. Suze is gesturing with a frown, and Jess is nodding. They must have a problem. I wonder what it is. And I can\u2019t even help.</p><p>As I\u2019m watching, Suze gets out her phone. She dials, and as the phone in the flat rings, I jump guiltily and move away from the window.</p><p>OK. Act casual. I take a deep breath, then lift the receiver.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hi, Suze!\u201d I say, in my most natural manner. \u201cHow are you doing? You\u2019re probably in Hampshire on your horse or somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d says Suze suspiciously.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got...Caller ID,\u201d I fib. \u201cSo, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great!\u201d says Suze, sounding totally stilted. \u201cActually, Bex, I was just reading this article about pregnant women, and it said you should go for a twenty-minute walk every day for health. So I was thinking maybe you should go on one. Like...now. Just round the block.\u201d</p><p>She wants to get me out of the way! Right. What I\u2019ll do is play along but not make it look too obvious.</p><p>\u201cA twenty-minute walk,\u201d I say in thoughtful tones. \u201cThat sounds like a good idea. Maybe I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any more than twenty minutes,\u201d Suze adds hurriedly. \u201cJust twenty minutes exactly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll go right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Suze sounds relieved. \u201cEr...see you...sometime!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you!\u201d</p><p>I hurry to the hall, put on my coat, and head downstairs in the lift. When I step outside, Suze and Jess have disappeared. They must be hiding!</p><p>Trying to look just like any normal pregnant woman having a twenty-minute walk, I head toward the gates, my eyes swiveling from left to right.</p><p>Oh my God, I just saw Suze behind that car! And there\u2019s Jess crouching behind the low wall!</p><p>I can\u2019t let them know I can see them. I can\u2019t giggle. Keeping my composure, I reach the gates \u2014 and spot a familiar spring of curly brown hair behind a rhododendron bush.</p><p>No. I don\u2019t believe it. Is that Mum?</p><p>I get past the gates and burst into laughter, muffling the sound with my hands. I hurry along the pavement, find a bench in the next street, and flick through Heat magazine, which I hid inside my coat so Suze wouldn\u2019t see. Then, on the dot of twenty minutes, I get up and turn my steps back toward home.</p><p>As I walk through the gates again there\u2019s no sign of anyone. I let myself in and take the lift to the top floor, feeling bubbles of anticipation. I head to our apartment, put my key in the lock, and turn.</p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d A chorus of voices greets me as I swing the door back wide. And the weird thing is, even though I was expecting it, I feel a genuine shock to see so many friendly faces clustered together. Suze, Jess, Mum, Janice, Danny...and is that Kelly?</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I drop Heat without even meaning to. \u201cWhat on earth\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your shower!\u201d Suze is glowing pink with pleasure. \u201cSurprise! We fooled you! Come in, have a glass of Buck\u2019s Fizz....\u201d</p><p>She ushers me into the sitting room, and I can\u2019t believe the transformation. There are pink and blue helium balloons everywhere, and a huge cake sitting on a silver stand, and a pile of presents, and bottles of champagne on ice....</p><p>\u201cThis is just...\u201d My voice suddenly wobbles. \u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Bex!\u201d says Suze.</p> <p>\u201cHave a drink, love!\u201d Mum thrusts a glass into my hand.</p><p>\u201cI knew we shouldn\u2019t surprise her!\u201d Janice looks alarmed. \u201cI said it would be too much of a shock for her system!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprised to see me?\u201d Kelly has bounded up to me, her face shining with excitement and Stila shimmer makeup.</p><p>\u201cKelly!\u201d I fling my drink-free arm around her. I met Kelly in Cumbria, when I was looking for Jess. I was only just pregnant then, and didn\u2019t even know it yet. It seems years ago now.</p><p>\u201cWere you really surprised, Bex?\u201d Suze looks at me, her face full of suppressed glee.</p> <p>\u201cTotally!\u201d</p><p>And it\u2019s true. OK, I knew it was happening. But I had no idea anyone would make so much effort! Every time I look around, I notice something else, like the silver \u201cbaby\u201d confetti sprinkled over the table, or the little booties hanging from all the pictures....</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothing yet,\u201d says Danny, taking a swig of champagne. \u201cOK, everyone, line up, unbutton your jackets, on the count of three...\u201d</p><p>I watch, bemused, as they scramble into place, like some kind of motley chorus line.</p><p>\u201cOne...two...three!\u201d</p><p>Everyone, from Mum to Jess to Kelly, flings open their jackets. And underneath they\u2019re all wearing matching Danny Kovitz Tshirts, just like the one he designed for The Look. Except the picture is of a little doll-like pregnant girl. And underneath is the slogan:</p> <p>SHE\u2019S a YuMMY MuMMY and WE LOVE HER</p><p>I can\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s overwhelmed!\u201d Mum comes bustling up. \u201cTake a seat, love. Have a snack.\u201d She thrusts a platter of tiny Chinese duck pancakes at me. \u201cWaitrose\u2019s own brand. They\u2019re very good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your presents,\u201d instructs Suze, clapping her hands. \u201cThen we\u2019ve got party games. Hey, everyone sit down, Bex is going to open her presents....\u201d She heaves all the gift-wrapped parcels into a pile in front of me, then tinkles a fork in her glass. \u201cNow, I have a little speech to make about the presents. Attention!\u201d</p><p>Everyone turns expectantly toward Suze and she makes a little bow.</p><p>\u201cThank you! Now, when I was planning this baby shower, I asked Jess what she thought we should buy Becky. And Jess said, \u2018There\u2019s nothing left, she\u2019s bought all of London already.\u2019\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s the hugest roar of laughter around the room, and I feel my cheeks turn beet-red. OK, maybe I did go a tad overboard. But the point is I had to. I mean, I\u2019ll be far too busy to go shopping after the baby\u2019s born. I probably won\u2019t go near a shop for a year.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d resumes Suze, her eyes sparkling. \u201cJess suggested we should make things. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019ve made things?</p><p>Oh God, they haven\u2019t all made baby wipes, have they?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start with mine.\u201d Suze hands me a rectangular package and I start ripping off the silver paper in slight apprehension.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d I breathe as I see what it is. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not baby wipes. It\u2019s an exquisite photo frame, made out of creamy painted wood, with tiny little mirrors and mother-of-pearl set into it. Inside, instead of a photograph, is a cartoon of a stick girl holding a baby in front of a house.</p><p>\u201cYou can put a picture of the baby in it,\u201d Suze is explaining. \u201cBut for now, I\u2019ve drawn a picture of you in front of your new house.\u201d</p><p>I look at the picture more closely and can\u2019t help bursting into laughter. The cartoon house has been divided up into rooms and each one given a label. \u201cPram Room.\u201d \u201cNappy Room.\u201d \u201cLipstick Room.\u201d \u201cVisa Bill Room\u201d (in the cellar). \u201cAntiques of the Future Room.\u201d</p><p>An Antiques of the Future Room! That\u2019s actually a brilliant idea.</p><p>As I open my other presents I\u2019m totally overwhelmed. Kelly\u2019s is a tiny patchwork quilt, with patches contributed by all the lovely friends I made in Scully. Janice\u2019s is a tiny red hand-knitted jumper with Baby\u2019s First Christmas embroidered on the front. Mum\u2019s is the matching Father Christmas hat and booties. Danny\u2019s is the coolest designer distressed romper suit ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow mine,\u201d says Jess, placing the largest present of the lot in front of me. It\u2019s wrapped in a patchwork of old, crumpled wrapping papers, one of which is printed with the words Happy 2000!</p><p>\u201cBe careful taking the paper off!\u201d says Jess as I start to unwrap it. \u201cI can use it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...OK!\u201d Gently I peel the paper away and fold it up. There\u2019s a layer of tissue paper underneath, and I pull it away to see a box about two feet high, made of pale, polished wood. Puzzled, I turn it around to face me \u2014 and it\u2019s not a box after all. It\u2019s a little cupboard with double doors and tiny porcelain handles. And Baby\u2019s Shoes carved into the front.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I look up.</p> <p>\u201cOpen it up.\u201d Jess\u2019s face is shining. \u201cGo on!\u201d</p><p>I tug it open, and there are little shelves, sloped and lined with white suede. On one of them is resting the smallest pair of red baseball boots I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>It\u2019s a little tiny Shoe Room.</p><p>\u201cJess...\u201d I can feel tears welling up. \u201cYou made this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom helped.\u201d She gives a self-deprecating shrug. \u201cWe did it together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it was Jess\u2019s idea,\u201d chips in Suze. \u201cIsn\u2019t it brilliant? I wish I\u2019d thought of it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d I\u2019m totally bowled over. \u201cLook at the way the doors fit...and the way the shelves are carved....\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom always was good with his hands.\u201d Janice clamps a hanky to her eyes. \u201cThis can be his memorial. We\u2019ll probably never have a tombstone.\u201d</p><p>I exchange looks with Mum, who pulls a familiar Janice-has-lost-it expression.</p><p>\u201cJanice, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not dead\u2014\u201d Jess begins.</p><p>\u201cWe can engrave his dates on the back,\u201d Janice continues. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Becky, love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr...well no,\u201d I say uncertainly. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead, Janice!\u201d Jess almost yells. \u201cI know he\u2019s not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, where is he?\u201d Janice pulls her hanky from her eyes, which are smudgy with mauve eye shadow. \u201cYou broke that boy\u2019s heart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I suddenly remember. \u201cJess, I got a package for you this morning. Maybe it\u2019s from him.\u201d</p><p>I hurry to the hall and bring back the parcel. Jess rips it open and a CD falls out. On it is written simply \u201cFrom Tom.\u201d</p><p>We all stare at it for a moment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a DVD,\u201d says Danny, picking it up. \u201cPut it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his last will and testament!\u201d cries Janice hysterically. \u201cIt\u2019s a message from beyond the grave!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not from beyond the grave,\u201d Jess snaps, but as she heads to the DVD player I can see that she\u2019s gone pale.</p><p>She presses Play and crouches down on the floor. We all wait in silence as the screen flickers. Then suddenly there\u2019s Tom, facing the camera, against a blue sky. He\u2019s wearing an old green polo shirt and looks pretty disheveled.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jess,\u201d he says momentously. \u201cBy the time you see this, I\u2019ll be in Chile. Because...that\u2019s where I am now.\u201d</p><p>Jess stiffens. \u201cChile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChile?\u201d Janice shrieks. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing in Chile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Tom\u2019s saying. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll move to the other side of the world if that\u2019s what it takes. Or farther.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s so romantic,\u201d sighs Kelly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a stupid prat,\u201d Jess says, knocking a fist against her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m not going out there for three months!\u201d</p><p>But her eyes are glistening, I notice.</p><p>\u201cLook what I\u2019ve found you.\u201d Tom is holding a chunk of some black shiny rock up to the camera. \u201cYou\u2019ll love this country, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get cholera!\u201d Janice is saying in agitation. \u201cOr malaria! Tom\u2019s always had a weak system\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get work as a carpenter,\u201d Tom is saying. \u201cI can write my book. We\u2019ll be happy here. And if Mum gives you any grief, just remember what I told you about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you?\u201d Janice looks up sharply. \u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...nothing.\u201d Jess hastily presses Stop and whips the DVD out of the machine. \u201cI\u2019ll watch the rest later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d says Mum cheerily. \u201cHe\u2019s alive, Janice love. That\u2019s good news!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive?\u201d Janice is still in a state of hysteria. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of being alive in Chile?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAt least he\u2019s out in the world!\u201d says Jess with sudden passion. \u201cAt least he\u2019s doing something with his life! You know, he\u2019s been really depressed, Janice. This is just what he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what my son needs!\u201d Janice retorts indignantly as the doorbell rings. I heave myself to my feet, glad of an excuse to get out of the line of fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just get this....\u201d I head into the hall and pick up the entry phone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a delivery for you,\u201d comes a crackly voice.</p> <p>My heart skips a beat. A delivery. This has to be it. It has to be. As I press the buzzer I can hardly breathe. I\u2019m telling myself firmly not to hope, it\u2019ll be another package for Jess, or a catalog, or a computer part for Luke....</p><p>But when I open the door, there\u2019s a motorbike courier standing in his leathers, holding a big padded envelope, and I already recognize Dave Sharpness\u2019s writing in bold black marker pen.</p><p>I lock myself in the cloakroom and feverishly rip the envelope open. There\u2019s a manila folder inside, marked \u201cBrandon.\u201d On the front is stuck a Post-it note, with a scribbled message: Hope this helps. Any further assistance required, do not hesitate. Yours, Dave S.</p><p>I open it up, and it\u2019s all there. Copies of all the notes, transcripts of conversations, photos...I leaf through, my heart thumping. I\u2019d forgotten quite how much stuff they had collected on Iain Wheeler. For a crappy private detective agency in West Ruislip, they actually did a great job.</p><p>I quickly bundle it all up again and head into the cool, empty kitchen. I\u2019m about to pick up the phone to call Luke, when it rings, making me jump.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Brandon,\u201d comes an unfamiliar male voice. \u201cMike Enwright from the Press Association here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I stare at the phone, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI just wondered if you could comment on rumors that your husband\u2019s company is going down?\u201d</p><p>I feel a shiver of shock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going down,\u201d I say robustly. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNews is, he\u2019s lost the Arcodas account. And the latest rumor is Foreland Investment is going the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has not lost Arcodas!\u201d I exclaim, furious. \u201cThey have parted ways for reasons which I cannot discuss. And for your information, my husband\u2019s company is as strong as ever. Stronger! Luke Brandon has been courted by high-caliber clients all his career, and he always will be. He is a man of immense integrity, talent, intelligence, good looks, and...and dress sense.\u201d</p><p>I break off, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cOK then!\u201d Mike Enwright is chuckling. \u201cI get the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to quote all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d He chuckles again. \u201cBut I like your attitude. Thanks for your time, Mrs. Brandon.\u201d</p><p>He rings off and, flustered, I run water into a glass. I have to talk to Luke. I dial his direct line and get through on the third ring.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Luke sounds alert. \u201cHas anything\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d I check outside the kitchen door and lower my voice. \u201cLuke, the Press Association just rang. They wanted a quote about you\u201d\u2014I swallow\u2014\u201cgoing down. They said Foreland were leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is bullshit!\u201d Luke\u2019s voice erupts in anger. \u201cThose Arcodas fuckers are feeding stories to the press.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t really damage you, could they?\u201d I say fearfully.</p><p>\u201cNot if I have anything to do with it.\u201d Luke sounds resolute. \u201cThe gloves are off. If they want to fight, we\u2019ll fight. We\u2019ll take them to court if it comes to it. Charge them with harassment. Expose the whole bloody lot of them.\u201d</p><p>I feel a huge surge of pride as I hear him speak. He sounds like the Luke Brandon I first met. Assured and in charge of the situation. Not running around after Iain Wheeler like some lackey.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d My words spill out. \u201cI have...material on Iain Wheeler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d says Luke after a pause.</p><p>\u201cThere were some old cases of harassment and office bullying that were hushed up. I\u2019ve got a whole dossier on him, right here in my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got what?\u201d Luke sounds flabbergasted. \u201cBecky...what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Maybe I won\u2019t get into the whole private-detective-in-West-Ruislip story just now.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me how,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI just do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI said don\u2019t ask! But it\u2019s true. I\u2019ll have it all biked round to the office. You should probably have your lawyers ready to take a look. There are photos, notes, all kinds of evidence.... Honestly, Luke. If this all comes out...he\u2019s finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhotos? You\u2019ve been taking photos of Iain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...not me, exactly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, what is this?\u201d he demands. \u201cWhat the hell have you been up to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain later. Just trust me, Luke, please. This is going to help you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky...\u201d Luke\u2019s voice is incredulous. \u201cYou constantly amaze me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I say impulsively. \u201cCream them.\u201d I put the phone down and push my hair back with sweaty hands. I take a few gulps of water, then speed-dial Luke\u2019s regular courier firm and order a bike.</p><p>In half an hour or so, the folder will be with Luke. I just wish I could see his face when he opens it.</p><p>\u201cHi, Bex!\u201d I jump as Suze comes sauntering into the kitchen. Her expression changes as she sees me. \u201cBex...are you OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m...fine!\u201d I put on a hasty smile. \u201cJust taking some time out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to play games next!\u201d Suze opens the fridge and gets out a carton of orange juice. \u201cGuess the baby food...hunt the nappy pin...celebrities\u2019 babies names...\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe the trouble she\u2019s gone to, organizing all this.</p><p>\u201cSuze...thanks so much,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s all amazing. And my photo frame!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt came out well, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Suze looks pleased. \u201cYou know, it really inspired me. I\u2019m thinking of starting the frame business again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should!\u201d I say with enthusiasm. Suze used to make brilliant photo frames till she had the children. They were stocked in Liberty\u2019s and everything!</p> <p>\u201cI mean, the children are getting older now,\u201d Suze is saying. \u201cAnd if Lulu can write cookery books, why can\u2019t I make frames? It won\u2019t kill the kids if I work a few hours a day, will it? I\u2019ll still be a good mother.\u201d</p><p>I can see the anxiety in her eyes. I totally blame that cow Lulu. Suze never worried about being a good mother till she met her.</p><p>OK. Payback time.</p><p>\u201cSuze...I\u2019ve got something for you,\u201d I say, reaching into the kitchen drawer. \u201cBut you can\u2019t show Lulu, ever. Or tell her. Or tell anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d Suze looks intrigued. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>I hand Suze the long-lens photograph \u2014 the only thing I saved from the original folder. It\u2019s of Lulu in the street with her children. She looks pretty frazzled \u2014 in fact, she seems to be yelling at one of them. In her hands are four Mars Bars, which she\u2019s doling out. She\u2019s holding a couple of cans of Coke too, and under her arm is a jumbo packet of chips.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Suze appears almost too staggered to speak. \u201cNo. Are those\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMars Bars.\u201d I nod. \u201cAnd Cheesy Wotsits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Coke!\u201d Suze gives a gurgle of laughter and claps a hand over her mouth. \u201cBex, that has made my day. How on earth...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d I can\u2019t help giggling too.</p><p>\u201cWhat a hypocritical...cow!\u201d Suze is still peering at the picture in disbelief. \u201cYou know, she really got to me. I used to feel so inferior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should go on her TV show after all,\u201d I say. \u201cYou could take that photo with you. Show the producer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d Suze giggles. \u201cYou\u2019re evil! I\u2019m just going to keep it in a drawer and look at it when I need cheering up.\u201d</p><p>The phone suddenly shrills through the kitchen and my smile tightens. What if this is the press again? What if it\u2019s Luke with more news?</p><p>\u201cHey, Suze,\u201d I say casually. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and make sure everyone\u2019s OK? I\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Suze nods, and picks up her juice, her eyes still fixed on the photo. \u201cI\u2019ll just put this somewhere safe....\u201d</p><p>I wait until she\u2019s gone and the door is firmly closed, then steel myself and pick up the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky.\u201d The familiar drifty voice comes down the line. \u201cIt\u2019s Fabia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabia!\u201d I subside in relief. \u201cHow are you? Thanks so much for letting us use the house the other day. The Vogue people thought it was amazing! Did you get my flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wonderful,\u201d Fabia says vaguely. \u201cYeah, we got the flowers.

He likes to have a fallback position. Anyway, good luck with the house hunt....\u201d</p> <p>No. She can\u2019t really be doing this. She can\u2019t be leaving us in the lurch.</p><p>\u201cFabia, listen.\u201d I wipe my clammy face. \u201cPlease. We\u2019re having a baby any day. We don\u2019t have anywhere to go.

She\u2019s rung off. She doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>I switch the phone off. Slowly I walk over to the fridge and lean my head against the cool steel, feeling dizzy. We don\u2019t have our dream house anymore. We don\u2019t have any house anymore.</p><p>I lift the phone to call Luke, then stop. He\u2019s got enough on his plate as it is right now.</p> <p>In a few weeks we have to move out of our flat. Where are we going to go?</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Kelly bursts into the kitchen, giggling. \u201cWe\u2019ve put candles on your cake. I know it\u2019s not your birthday, but you should blow them out anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I jolt into life. \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d</p><p>Somehow I manage to hold myself together as I follow Kelly back to the sitting room. Inside, Danny and Janice are playing guess the baby food and writing down their answers on sheets. Mum and Jess are perusing pictures of celebrity babies.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lourdes!\u201d Mum is saying. \u201cJess, love, you should be more aware of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPureed beet,\u201d says Danny knowledgeably as he tastes a spoonful of purple goo. \u201cAll it needs is a shot of vodka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Mum looks up. \u201cEverything all right, love?

It was such a great baby shower. And everyone got on so well! Janice and Jess made up in the end, and Jess promised she\u2019d look after Tom in Chile and not let any guerrilla bandits get him. Suze and Kelly had a long conversation while they played guess the baby food, ending up with Suze offering Kelly a job as au pair during her year off. But the really amazing thing is, Jess and Danny have hit it off! Danny started talking to her about some new collection he wants to do using shards of rocks \u2014 and she\u2019s going to take him to a museum to see some specimens.</p><p>The bike arrived while everyone was eating cake, and the package went off OK. I haven\u2019t heard back from Luke, though. I guess he\u2019s in talks with his lawyers or whoever it is. So he doesn\u2019t know about the house yet, either.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Becky?\u201d says Mum, giving me a hug at the front door. \u201cWould you like me to stay with you till Luke arrives home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s OK. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have a nice afternoon rest. Save your energy, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I nod. \u201cBye, Mum.\u201d</p><p>The place feels silent and flat with everyone gone. It\u2019s just me and all the stuff. I wander into the nursery, gently touching the handcrafted crib and the little white rocking cradle. And the Moses basket with its gorgeous linen canopy. (I wanted to give the baby a choice of sleeping accommodations.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s like a stage set. We\u2019re just waiting for the lead character to appear.</p><p>I prod my tummy, wondering if it\u2019s awake. Maybe I\u2019ll play it a tune and it can be a musical genius when it\u2019s born! I wind up the mobile I ordered from the Intelligent Baby catalog and press it against my tummy.</p><p>Baby, listen to that! That\u2019s Mozart.</p><p>I think.... Or Beethoven or someone.</p> <p>God, now I\u2019ve confused it. I\u2019m just looking on the box to see if the tune is by Mozart, when there\u2019s a small crash from the hall.</p><p>Christmas cards. That\u2019ll make me feel better. Abandoning the Intelligent Baby mobile, I head to the front door, pick up the huge pile of post lying on the doormat, and waddle back to the sofa, leafing through the envelopes.</p><p>And then I stop. There\u2019s a small package, labeled in distinctive, flowing writing.</p><p>Venetia\u2019s.</p><p>It\u2019s addressed to Luke, but I don\u2019t care. With trembling hands I rip it open, to find a tiny leather Duchamp box. I wrench it open, and there\u2019s a pair of silver and enamel cuff links. What is she doing sending him cuff links?</p> <p>A small cream card falls out, with a message written in the same script.</p><p>L</p><p>Long time no see. \u201cNunc est bibendum?\u201d</p><p>V</p><p>I stare at the note, the blood rushing through my head. All the stresses of the day seem to be focusing in a laser of fury. I\u2019ve had it. I\u2019ve just had it. I\u2019m going to send this package straight back, return of post\u2014</p><p>No. I\u2019m going to give it back to her myself.</p> <p>In a daze, I find myself getting to my feet and reaching for my coat. I\u2019m going to find Venetia and I\u2019m going to finish this. Once and for all.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>I\u2019VE NEVER BEEN more itching for a showdown in my life.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to track down Venetia. I phoned the Holistic Birth Center, pretending to be really desperate to talk to her and asking where she was. After saying she was \u201cunavailable,\u201d the receptionist let slip that she was at the Cavendish Hospital, in a meeting. They offered to page her, as I\u2019m still on the system as a patient, but I hastily said don\u2019t bother, actually I was feeling better all of a sudden. Which they totally swallowed. They\u2019re obviously used to flaky pregnant women phoning up and dithering.</p><p>So now I\u2019m standing outside the Cavendish Hospital\u2019s private maternity wing, my heart racing, clutching a carrier bag from The Look. It contains not only the cuff links but also the support stockings, the fanny pack, every single little note she ever sent Luke, the brochures and medical notes from her stupid holistic center...even the freebies from the goodie bag. (It was a bit of a wrench putting in the Cr\u00e8me de la Mer. In fact I scooped out most of it and put it in an old Lanc\u00f4me pot. But Venetia needn\u2019t know that.)</p><p>It\u2019s like a breakup box. I\u2019m going to hand it to her and say, very calmly, \u201cLeave us alone, Venetia. Luke and I and the baby don\u2019t want anything to do with you ever again.\u201d She has to realize she\u2019s lost, after that.</p><p>Plus I phoned up my lovely professor on the way here, and he gave me a brilliant Latin insult, which I\u2019ve learned by heart. It goes Utinam barbari provinciam tuam invadant! and it means \u201cMay barbarians invade your province.\u201d</p><p>Ha. That\u2019ll teach her.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d A tinny voice comes through the intercom system.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say into the grille. \u201cIt\u2019s Becky Brandon, a patient.\u201d I won\u2019t say any more. I\u2019ll just get into the place and take it from there.</p><p>The door buzzes and I push it open. Normally this place is pretty tranquil, but today it\u2019s full of activity. The seats are filled with women in various stages of pregnancy, chatting with their partners and holding leaflets entitled \u201cWhy Choose the Cavendish?\u201d Two midwives are walking quickly down the corridor, saying words like operating and stuck, which I really don\u2019t like the sound of, and I can hear a woman\u2019s screams emanating from a distant room. My stomach curdles at the sound, and I fight the urge to put my hands over my ears.</p><p>Anyway. It wasn\u2019t necessarily a scream of agony. She was probably just shouting because she couldn\u2019t see the telly or something.</p><p>I approach the reception desk, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say. \u201cMy name\u2019s Rebecca Brandon, and I need to see Venetia Carter straightaway, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d the receptionist demands. I haven\u2019t seen her on duty before. She has graying curly hair, and glasses on silver chains, and a pretty abrupt manner for someone who\u2019s dealing with pregnant women all day long.</p><p>\u201cWell...no. But it\u2019s really important.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Venetia is busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind waiting.

Venetia\u2019s only in some stupid meeting. And here I am, practically nine months pregnant....</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t you page her?\u201d I try to stay calm.</p><p>\u201cI can only page her if you\u2019re in labor.\u201d The woman shrugs, like it really isn\u2019t her problem.</p><p>I stare at her through a fine mist of anger. I\u2019ve come here to have it out with Venetia, and I\u2019m not letting some woman in a mauve cardigan stop me.</p><p>\u201cWell...I am in labor!\u201d I hear myself saying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in labor?\u201d She eyes me skeptically.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t believe me, does she? What a nerve. Why would I lie about a thing like that?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I plant my hands on my hips. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you having regular contractions?\u201d she says, challenging me.</p><p>\u201cSince yesterday, every three minutes,\u201d I shoot back. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got back pain, and I\u2019ve been vacuuming nonstop...and...and my water broke yesterday.\u201d</p><p>So there. Now tell me I\u2019m not in labor.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The woman looks a little taken aback. \u201cWell...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I want to see only Venetia, no one else,\u201d I add, pressing home my advantage. \u201cSo, can you page her immediately, please?\u201d</p><p>The woman is regarding me with a narrowed gaze.</p><p>\u201cYour contractions are coming every three minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Suddenly I realize I must have been standing in this reception area for at least three minutes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coping with them silently,\u201d I inform her with dignity. \u201cI\u2019m a Scientologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Scientologist?\u201d she echoes, putting her pen down and staring at me.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I meet her gaze, unflinching. \u201cAnd I need to see Venetia urgently. But if you won\u2019t let in a woman whose water broke yesterday and is silently suffering in great pain...\u201d I raise my voice a little so that it carries to all the waiting pregnant women.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d The receptionist clearly realizes she\u2019s defeated. \u201cYou can wait....\u201d She surveys the packed seating area. \u201cWait in that room,\u201d she says at last, and gestures to a room called Labor Room 3.</p> <p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I turn on my heel and head into Labor Room3. It\u2019s a big room, with a scary-looking metal bed and a shower room and even a DVD player. No minibar, though.</p><p>I sit on the bed and swiftly get out my makeup case. Everyone knows the first rule of business is \u201cLook good during confrontations.\u201d Or if it isn\u2019t, it should be. I put on some blusher and apply some fresh lipstick \u2014 and am practicing my steeliest expression in the mirror, when there\u2019s a knock at the door.</p><p>That\u2019s her. With the most enormous lurch of nerves I grab the breakup bag and stand up.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I say as calmly as possible, and a moment later, the door swings open.</p><p>\u201cHello, love!\u201d A jolly-looking Afro-Caribbean midwife comes bustling in. \u201cI\u2019m Esther. How are you getting on? Contractions still coming thick and strong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cEr...no. I mean, yes....\u201d I break off in confusion. \u201cListen, I really need to see Venetia Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on her way,\u201d says the midwife soothingly. \u201cI\u2019ll get you sorted out in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>I feel a tweak of suspicion. They haven\u2019t paged Venetia at all, have they? They\u2019re trying to palm me off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need sorting out,\u201d I say politely. \u201cThanks all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, you\u2019re having a baby!\u201d The midwife peals with laughter. \u201cYou need to get into a gown. Or did you bring a T-shirt? And I\u2019ll need to examine you, see how you\u2019re progressing.\u201d</p><p>I need to get rid of this woman, quick. She presses a hand on my abdomen and I shrink away.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve already been examined!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cBy another midwife. So I\u2019m all set....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother midwife? Who? Sarah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...maybe. I don\u2019t remember. She suddenly rushed off, said she had to go to theater or something?\u201d I blink innocently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start you a new chart.\u201d Esther shakes her head, sighing. \u201cI\u2019ll have to examine you again....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I squeak before I can stop myself. \u201cI mean...I have a phobia about being examined. They said I could have minimal examination. Venetia understands. I really need to see Venetia, no one else. In fact, could you leave me alone till she comes? I want to focus on my...my inner womanhood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Esther rolls her eyes, then heads to the door and leans her head out.</p><p>\u201cPam.

So, your water broke at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cDid the other midwife say how far you\u2019d got?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm...four centimeters,\u201d I say at random.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re coping with the pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, so far,\u201d I say bravely.</p><p>\u201cWell, now.\u201d The midwife finishes writing. \u201cI really must examine you, so if you pop up on the bed for me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I back away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me! I only want Venetia!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a knock at the door and a woman pops her head round it. \u201cEsther? Can you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re busy today.\u201d Esther sighs and hangs the chart on the end of the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. And Venetia should be here soon.

I\u2019m just wondering whether they have any DVDs for hire, when there\u2019s another knock at the door.</p><p>It has to be Venetia this time. I grab the breakup bag, struggle to my feet, and take a deep breath to prepare myself.</p><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d</p> <p>The door opens and a girl of about twenty, in a midwife uniform, looks in. She\u2019s got blond wispy hair tied back and looks very apprehensive.</p><p>\u201cUm, hi,\u201d she says. \u201cMy name\u2019s Paula and I\u2019m a student midwife. Would you mind if I come and observe you in the early stages of labor for a while? I\u2019d be really, really grateful.\u201d</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about to say \u201cNo, go away.\u201d But she looks so shy and nervous, I can\u2019t bring myself to. After all, I can always get rid of her when Venetia arrives.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I wave an arm. \u201cCome on in. My name\u2019s Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there.\u201d She smiles shyly as she tiptoes in and sits down on a chair in the corner.</p><p>For a minute or two neither of us says anything. I\u2019ve flopped back on the pillows and am staring at the ceiling, trying to hide my frustration. Here I am, all ready for a confrontation, and there\u2019s no one to confront. If Venetia doesn\u2019t show in the next five minutes, I\u2019ll just go.</p><p>\u201cYou seem very...serene.\u201d Paula looks up from scribbling on her notepad. \u201cDo you have any particular coping mechanisms for the pain?\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. I\u2019m supposed to be in labor. I\u2019d better put on a show or she\u2019ll have nothing to write down.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I nod. \u201cI\u2019ll just move around a bit, actually. I find that really helps.\u201d I get up and walk around the bed, swinging my arms back and forth in a businesslike way. Then I rock my hips around a few times, and do a stretch I once learned in Yoga-lates.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d says Paula, impressed. \u201cYou\u2019re very mobile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done yoga,\u201d I say with a modest little glow. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have a Kit Kat now. Just to keep my energy levels up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Paula nods. As I reach for my bag I can see her writing down \u201cEats Kit Kat,\u201d on her notes, and underneath, \u201cUsing yoga for pain relief.\u201d She riffles back in her file, then looks up sympathetically. \u201cDuring contractions, where\u2019s most of the pain focused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...just...around,\u201d I say vaguely, munching on my Kit Kat. \u201cKind of here...and here...\u201d I gesture at my body. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem amazingly calm, Becky.\u201d Paula is gazing at me as I check my teeth in my hand mirror for Kit Kat crumbs. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a laboring woman with such self-control!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a Scientologist,\u201d I can\u2019t resist saying. \u201cSo I\u2019m trying to keep as quiet as possible, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Scientologist!\u201d Her eyes open wide. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d Then she frowns in alarm. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in total silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the sort that\u2019s allowed to talk,\u201d I explain. \u201cBut not scream or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You know, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever had a Scientologist in here before!\u201d She looks quite animated. \u201cDo you mind if I just tell a couple of my colleagues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead!\u201d I nod absently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she hurries out, I crumple up my Kit Kat wrapper and throw it in the bin, frustrated.

I think I\u2019ll go home.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in here!\u201d The door is flung open and a whole crowd of young midwives floods into the room, led by Paula. \u201cThis is Rebecca Brandon,\u201d she addresses the group in an undertone. \u201cShe\u2019s four centimeters dilated and is using yoga to help deal with the pain. Because she\u2019s a Scientologist she\u2019s keeping very quiet and calm.

I\u2019m almost sorry to let them down.</p><p>\u201cActually, I think it might be a false alarm.\u201d I pick up my bag and shrug on my coat. \u201cI\u2019m going home now. Thanks very much for all your help\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go home!\u201d says Paula with a little laugh. She consults my chart and nods. \u201cI thought so. Rebecca, your water has broken. You\u2019ll run the risk of infection!\u201d She pulls off my coat and takes my bag. \u201cYou\u2019re staying here till that baby\u2019s out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, stymied.</p><p>What do I do now? Should I tell them I made up that my water has broken?</p><p>No. They\u2019ll think I\u2019m a total loony. What I\u2019ll do is wait till they leave me alone and then sneak out. Yes. Good plan.</p><p>\u201cShe could be in transition,\u201d one of the student midwives is saying knowledgeably to another. \u201cThey often want to go home at that stage. They get quite irrational.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRebecca, you really need to put on a hospital gown.\u201d Paula is surveying me with anxiety. \u201cThe baby could be well on the way. How are the contractions feeling? Are they coming quicker? Can I examine you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s requested minimal monitoring and examination,\u201d chips in another student midwife, looking at my chart. \u201cShe wants everything natural. I think we should get a senior midwife in here, Paula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI mean...I\u2019d like to be left alone for a while. If that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very stoic, Rebecca,\u201d says Paula, resting a sympathetic hand on my shoulder. \u201cBut we can\u2019t leave you alone! You don\u2019t even have a birth partner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, honestly.\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cJust for a few minutes. It\u2019s...it\u2019s part of my beliefs. The woman in labor needs to be on her own every hour to say a special chant.\u201d</p><p>Go on. I\u2019m willing them silently. Just leave me alone....</p> <p>\u201cWell, I guess we should respect your beliefs,\u201d Paula says uncertainly. \u201cOK. We\u2019ll pop out for a while, but if you feel anything moving on, just press the buzzer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will! Thanks!\u201d</p><p>The door closes and I subside in relief. Thank God. I\u2019m out of this place as soon as the coast is clear. I grab my bag and coat and open the door a chink \u2014 but two midwives are still standing right by the door. Hastily I close it again, trying not to make any noise. I\u2019ll have to wait a few moments more. They\u2019re bound to move away soon, and I\u2019ll make a dash for it.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in this situation. I should never have said I was in labor, I should never have pretended my water had broken. God, it\u2019s a lesson. I am never doing that again, ever.</p><p>After a little more time I check my watch. Three minutes have gone by. Maybe I\u2019ll check the corridor again. I pick up my coat, but before I can creep forward, the door bursts open.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Bex!\u201d Suze bursts in in a flurry of blond hair and Miu Miu embroidered coat. \u201cAre you OK? I came as soon as I heard....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze?\u201d I stare at her, poleaxed. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mum\u2019s just coming,\u201d she says breathlessly, throwing off her coat to reveal Danny\u2019s \u201cYummy Mummy\u201d T-shirt. \u201cWe were all together in a taxi when we got the news. Janice is getting some magazines and drinks and Kelly says she\u2019s going to wait down in reception....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut how...\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand. Is Suze psychic or something?</p><p>\u201cI rang your mobile and the woman who answered told me it was the Cavendish ward.\u201d Suze is babbling in excitement. \u201cShe said you\u2019d left your phone in reception and you were in labor! We all freaked! So we told the taxi driver to turn round straightaway and I\u2019ve canceled this dinner party we were throwing\u2014\u201d She stops abruptly as she notices my appearance. \u201cHey, Bex, why are you holding your coat? Is everything OK?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRebecca\u2019s doing great!\u201d says Paula.

Bex, didn\u2019t you bring your bag? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll go and buy you a T-shirt. And we need some music in here, and some candles maybe....\u201d She looks around critically.</p><p>\u201cUm...Suze...\u201d My stomach is bunched with nerves. \u201cActually...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock!\u201d There\u2019s a fresh voice at the door. \u201cIt\u2019s Louisa here! Can we come in?\u201d</p><p>Louisa? This can\u2019t be happening. She\u2019s the aromatherapist I hired for the birth. How the hell did she...</p><p>\u201cYour mum\u2019s been busy calling all the people on your list, just to make sure they knew!\u201d Suze beams. \u201cShe\u2019s so efficient! They\u2019re all on their way.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t cope. Everything\u2019s moving too quickly. Louisa has already got out some little vials of oils and is rubbing something orangey on the back of my neck. \u201cThere!\u201d she says. \u201cDoes that feel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely!\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Mum\u2019s shrill voice is sounding from outside the room. \u201cMy darling!\u201d She comes rushing in, clutching a bunch of flowers and a paper bag full of croissants. \u201cSit down! Take it easy! Where\u2019s your epidural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s managing without one!\u201d says Suze. \u201cIsn\u2019t she amazing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout one?\u201d Mum looks appalled.</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2019s using yoga and breathing techniques to cope with the pain,\u201d says Paula proudly. \u201cAren\u2019t you, Becky? She\u2019s already four centimeters!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove, don\u2019t put yourself through it.\u201d Mum grabs my arm, looking close to tears. \u201cAccept the pain relief! Take the drugs.\u201d</p><p>I feel like my tongue\u2019s glued to the bottom of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cNow, this is jasmine oil,\u201d comes Louisa\u2019s gentle voice in my ear. \u201cI\u2019ll rub it into your temples....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Mum says anxiously. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s having a contraction!\u201d exclaims Suze, grabbing my hand. \u201cBex, breathe....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it, love!\u201d Mum\u2019s face is screwing up tighter and tighter, as though she\u2019s in labor herself.</p><p>\u201cFocus on the baby.\u201d Paula\u2019s eyes are gazing intently into mine. \u201cFocus on that lovely baby of yours coming out into the world....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d I finally find my voice. \u201cI...the thing is, I\u2019m not in labor....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky, you are.\u201d Paula rests her hands on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cBex, conserve your energy!\u201d Suze shoves a straw into my mouth. \u201cHave some Lucozade. Then you\u2019ll feel better!\u201d Helplessly I suck at the sickly drink, and then stop dead as I hear hurried footsteps approaching. I know those footsteps. The door swings open and this time it\u2019s Luke, his face pale, his eyes dark and tense as he surveys the room.</p><p>\u201cThank God. Thank God I\u2019m not too late....\u201d He seems almost speechless as he comes toward me on the bed. \u201cBecky, I love you so much.... I\u2019m so proud of you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Luke,\u201d I say feebly.</p><p>Now what the fuck do I do?</p><p>The thing is, in a lot of ways this is the perfect birth.</p><p>It\u2019s twenty minutes later and the room is full of people. Felicity the reflexologist has arrived and is manipulating my toes. Maria the homeopath is measuring out some pills for me to take. Louisa is arranging essential oil burners around the place.</p><p>I have Mum and Suze sitting on one side of me, with Luke on the other. I\u2019ve got a flannel on my forehead and a water spray in my hand and I\u2019m wearing a long baggy T-shirt which Suze and Mum basically manhandled me into. I\u2019m relaxed, music is playing, I\u2019m managing without an epidural....</p><p>There\u2019s only one tiny hitch. And I still haven\u2019t plucked up the courage to tell anyone.</p><p>\u201cBecky, would you like some gas and air?\u201d Paula is approaching me with a face mask attached to a tube. \u201cJust to take the edge off the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I hesitate. \u201cWell, OK. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe it in just as you feel the contraction beginning,\u201d Paula instructs, handing me the mouthpiece. \u201cDon\u2019t leave it too late!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOK!\u201d I put the face mask over my nose and mouth and breathe in deeply.

You should try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, you\u2019re doing amazingly.\u201d He\u2019s clasping my hand tight, not taking his eyes off me. \u201cIs everything OK? Is everything going according to your birth plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...most things!\u201d I say, avoiding his eyes, and quickly suck in some more gas and air. Oh God. I have to tell him. I have to.</p> <p>\u201cLuke...\u201d I lean forward, feeling a bit tipsy from the gas and air. \u201cListen,\u201d I whisper in his ear. \u201cI\u2019m not having the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Luke strokes my forehead. \u201cNo one\u2019s in any hurry. It takes as long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>Actually...there\u2019s a thought. I mean, the baby\u2019s going to come out sometime, isn\u2019t it? I could just stay here and not say anything and drink Lucozade and watch the telly. And eventually something will happen and they\u2019ll just say, \u201cBecky was in labor for two weeks, poor thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke to Dr. Braine, by the way,\u201d Luke adds. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way over from the Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I try to hide my dismay. \u201cGreat!\u201d</p> <p>In desperation I breathe in the gas and air again, trying to come up with a plan. Maybe the bathroom has a window I could climb out of. Or I could say I want to walk down the corridor, and then find a newborn baby and just quickly borrow it for a moment....</p><p>\u201cI thought you were with Venetia Carter?\u201d Paula stops writing on my notes. \u201cIsn\u2019t she on her way?\u201d She glances at her watch. \u201cIf not, one of the senior midwives will need to examine you soon. Are you feeling any pressure, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...a bit, yes!\u201d</p><p>She has no idea.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Louisa gives me a pot of oil to sniff. \u201cClary sage for stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Paula, does labor ever go...backward?\u201d I ask the question casually, trying to hide my sudden spark of hope.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Paula laughs. \u201cThough it feels like it sometimes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha!\u201d I join in her laughter and flop back on my pillows, inhaling the clary sage for stress. What I need is an essential oil for telling people you\u2019re not in labor and they\u2019ve all got to go home.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door and Suze looks up. \u201cOoh. That might be Jess. She said she was on her way....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d calls Paula. The door opens. And I freeze.</p><p>It\u2019s Venetia. She\u2019s wearing operating scrubs with her hair all bundled into a green cap, and she looks totally glamorous and important, like she\u2019s been saving lives all day.</p><p>Bitch.</p><p>For an instant Venetia looks pretty shocked too, but then almost at once she comes over to the bed, a professional smile at her lips.</p><p>\u201cBecky! I had no idea the patient they paged me about was you. Let\u2019s have a look and see how you\u2019re getting on....\u201d Shetakes off her green cap and her hair tumbles radiantly down her back. \u201cLuke, how long has she been in? Fill me in on what\u2019s been happening.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s doing it again. She\u2019s cutting me out. She\u2019s trying to bewitch Luke.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d I exclaim in fury. \u201cI\u2019m not your patient anymore and you\u2019re not having a look at anything, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I don\u2019t care about being in labor. Or pretend-labor. Or whatever I\u2019m in. It\u2019s not too late; I can still have my big confrontation. As everyone gapes, I cast away the gas and air mask and heave myself off the bed.</p><p>\u201cSuze, can you give me that bag please?\u201d I say in a trembling voice. \u201cThe carrier under the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Here.\u201d Suze hands me the carrier bag. \u201cIs that her?\u201d she adds in my ear.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cCow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, Becky!\u201d Paula\u2019s saying in bright, uncertain tones. \u201cKeeping upright will help the baby descend....\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenetia, I have something to return to you.\u201d My voice is very slightly slurred, which is the fault of that stupid gas and air. And I keep breaking into a smile, which is a bit annoying. But anyway, she\u2019ll get the message.</p><p>\u201cLuke doesn\u2019t want these.\u201d I reach into the bag and throw the support stockings at her. They land on the floor and everyone looks at them.</p><p>Oh. I\u2019ve got a bit confused.</p><p>\u201cI mean...these.\u201d I chuck the cuff link box, hard, and it hits Venetia on the forehead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOw!

You tried to freak me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn affair?\u201d Venetia opens her eyes wide. \u201cBecky, Luke and I are just old friends!\u201d She gives her silvery laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Luke. I realize Becky has a problem with me. But I had no idea she was quite so possessive....\u201d</p><p>She looks totally reasonable, standing there in her green medical-authority uniform. And I\u2019m the deranged, drugged pregnant woman in a baggy T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cVen, it\u2019s fine,\u201d says Luke, looking uncomfortable. \u201cListen, we\u2019ve got Charles Braine coming to supervise. Maybe you should...leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should.\u201d Venetia nods conspiratorially at Luke, and I feel a stab of white-hot rage.</p><p>\u201cLuke, don\u2019t just let her get away with it! She said you were lovers! She said you were leaving me for her!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Angry tears are running down my face. \u201cNo one believes me, but it\u2019s true! She said the minute you saw each other again it was just a question of when and where. She said you were intoxicated with each other, and it was like Penelope and...someone. Othello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenelope and Odysseus?\u201d Luke stares at me.</p><p>\u201cYes! That\u2019s it. And you were meant to be together. And that I didn\u2019t have a marriage anymore....\u201d I wipe my runny nose with my T-shirt sleeve. \u201cAnd now she\u2019s pretending I\u2019m a completely deluded psycho....\u201d</p><p>Something has changed in Luke\u2019s eyes. \u201cPenelope and Odysseus?\u201d he says, an edge to his voice. \u201cVen?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a prickling silence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about,\u201d Venetia says smoothly.</p><p>\u201cWho are Penelope and Odysseus?\u201d Suze whispers in my ear, and I shrug helplessly.</p> <p>\u201cVenetia...\u201d Luke looks at her directly. \u201cWe were never Penelope and Odysseus.\u201d</p><p>For the first time ever, I see Venetia falter. She doesn\u2019t say anything, but just stares at Luke with a kind of defiance. Like she wants to say, Yes, we were.</p><p>OK, I have to know. \u201cLuke, who are Penelope and Odysseus?\u201d I ask.</p><p>I\u2019m really hoping they\u2019re not a PR guy and an obstetrician who get together after the wife is pushed out of the picture.</p><p>\u201cOdysseus left Penelope to go on a long journey,\u201d says Luke, his eyes still pinioning Venetia\u2019s. \u201cThe Odyssey. And Penelope waited faithfully for him. For twenty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she hasn\u2019t waited faithfully for you!\u201d Suze says, pointing an indignant finger at Venetia. \u201cShe\u2019s had affairs all over the place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenetia, did you tell Becky we were having an affair?\u201d Luke\u2019s stentorian voice makes us all jump. \u201cDid you say I was leaving her for you? Did you try to break her confidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t,\u201d says Venetia coldly. Her eyes are hard but her jaw is trembling slightly, I notice.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Luke\u2019s tone is still scathing. \u201cWell, let\u2019s make it crystal clear once and for all. I would never have an affair with you, Venetia. I would never have an affair with anyone.\u201d He turns to me and takes both my hands. \u201cBecky, there is nothing whatsoever between me and Venetia, whatever she might have said. We dated for a year. As teenagers. That\u2019s it. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cHow did you break up?\u201d Suze says with interest, then flushes as everyone turns to look at her. \u201cIt\u2019s relevant!\u201d she says defensively. \u201cYou should be open about past relationships! Tarkie and I know everything about each other\u2019s old flings. If you\u2019d told Bex, instead of...\u201d She trails off.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d Luke nods. \u201cBecky...maybe I should have explained what happened between us.

And we ended it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou panicked.\u201d Venetia\u2019s voice is suddenly throbbing, as though she can\u2019t control a long-buried anger. \u201cYou panicked, Luke, and we lost the best relationship I\u2019ve ever had. Everyone was jealous of us at Cambridge, everyone. We were perfect together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t perfect!\u201d He looks at her incredulously. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t panic\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did!

For a few seconds she appears speechless \u2014 then her eyes focus on me with such aggression that I shrink away.</p><p>\u201cAnd she is?\u201d she demands with a savage gesture. \u201cThis mindless consumer little...girlie is who you\u2019re going to spend the rest of your days with? Luke, she has no depth! She has no brain! All she cares about is her shopping, and her clothes...and her girlfriends....\u201d</p><p>The blood has drained from my face and I feel a bit shaky.

Why the hell did you marry her?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a tiny intake of breath around the room. No one moves for about thirty seconds. Luke looks a bit stunned to have been asked such a blatant question.</p> <p>God, I wonder what he\u2019s going to say. Maybe he\u2019ll say for my brilliant cooking and repartee.</p><p>No. Unlikely.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019ll say...</p><p>I\u2019m a bit stumped, to be honest. And if I\u2019m stumped, Luke must be too.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I marry Becky?\u201d he echoes at last, in such a strange voice that I think maybe he\u2019s suddenly wondering himself, and realizing he made a terrible mistake.</p><p>All of a sudden I feel a bit cold and a bit scared.</p><p>And still Luke hasn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>He walks over to the sink and pours himself a cup of water as everyone watches nervously. At last he turns. \u201cHave you spent time with Becky?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have!\u201d says Suze, as though she\u2019s going to win the Jackpot prize. Everyone turns to look at her, and she colors. \u201cSorry,\u201d she mutters.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I ever saw Becky Bloomwood...\u201d He pauses, a tiny smile at his lips. \u201cShe was asking a bank marketing department why they didn\u2019t produce checkbook covers in different colors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d Venetia tosses a hand impatiently, but Luke doesn\u2019t even flicker.</p><p>\u201cThe next year they did produce checkbook covers in different colors. Becky\u2019s instincts match no one else\u2019s. Becky has ideas no one else has. Her mind goes to places no one else\u2019s does. And sometimes I\u2019m lucky enough to go along with her.\u201d Luke\u2019s eyes meet mine, soft and warm. \u201cYes, she shops. Yes, she does crazy things. But she makes me laugh. She makes me enjoy life. And I love her more than anything else in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I mumble, a lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d says Venetia, her face pale. \u201cFine, Luke! If you want a shallow little airhead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea, so shut the fuck up.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice is suddenly like a machine gun.</p><p>Mum opens her mouth to protest Luke\u2019s language \u2014 but he looks so livid, she closes it again, looking nervous.</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2019s a lot more principled than you ever were.\u201d He\u2019s regarding Venetia with contempt. \u201cShe\u2019s brave. She puts other people before herself. I couldn\u2019t have got through the last few days without her. You guys probably know what trouble my company is in at the moment....\u201d He glances at Suze and Mum.</p><p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d Mum looks alarmed. \u201cWhat kind of trouble? Becky never told us!\u201d</p><p>Luke turns to me, incredulous. \u201cBecky, haven\u2019t you said anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew something was up,\u201d Suze gasps. \u201cI knew it. All those phone calls.

Isn\u2019t it?\u201d Luke appeals to the student midwives.</p> <p>\u201cShe is pretty special,\u201d agrees Paula, who has been following the exchange with Venetia with a wide-open mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re all observing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial, huh?\u201d Venetia suddenly says. She comes over and looks me up and down, her eyes narrowed. \u201cBecky, when exactly was your last contraction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cIt was...er...just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Scientologist,\u201d puts in Paula eagerly. \u201cShe\u2019s managing the pain silently.

Leave me alone!\u201d I grab the gas and air mask and start gulping it in. That\u2019s better. God, we should have a tank of this stuff at home.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d The door is thrust open and everyone looks up to see Danny bursting in, followed by Jess. \u201cWe\u2019re here! Did we miss it?\u201d</p><p>Jess is wearing her She\u2019s a Yummy Mummy and We Love Her T-shirt, to match Suze\u2019s. Danny is wearing a blue cashmere tank with She\u2019s a RedHaired Bitch and I Hate Her printed in khaki on the front.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the baby?\u201d Danny looks around the room with bright eyes, taking in the tense scene. His eyes alight on Venetia. \u201cHey, who invited Cruella de Venetia?\u201d</p><p>Luke is staring at the slogan on Danny\u2019s tank top. He gives a sudden snort of comprehending laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so juvenile,\u201d spits Venetia, who has also clocked the tank top. \u201cAll of you. And if Little Miss Becky is really in labor, then I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I shriek. \u201cOh! I\u2019m leaking!\u201d</p><p>God, that\u2019s the weirdest feeling.

You\u2019ll be wonderful.\u201d He\u2019s stroking my back rhythmically. \u201cDr. Braine\u2019s on his way. The redhaired bitch is just leaving. Aren\u2019t you, Venetia?\u201d He doesn\u2019t take his eyes off mine.</p><p>The contraction seems to have finished. The clenching sensation has died away. But I know it\u2019ll be back, like that scary guy on Elm Street.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d like an epidural after all,\u201d I gulp. \u201cQuite soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d says Paula, hurrying over. \u201cI\u2019ll page the anesthetist. You\u2019ve done so well to last this long, Becky....\u201d</p><p>\u201c...ridiculous.\u201d I hear the last word of some muttered epithet of Venetia\u2019s before she bangs the door closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat a cow!\u201d says Suze. \u201cI\u2019m telling all my pregnant friends what a cow she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d Luke kisses me on the forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s over. I\u2019m sorry, Becky. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I say automatically.</p><p>And actually...I mean it.</p><p>Already I feel like Venetia\u2019s irrelevant, drifting away from us like smoke. It\u2019s Luke and me that matters. And the baby.</p><p>Oh God, another contraction\u2019s starting already. This whole labor malarkey is a complete pain. I grab the gas and air mask and all the student midwives gather round, encouraging me as I start to inhale.</p> <p>\u201cYou can do it, Becky...stay relaxed...breathe....\u201d</p><p>Come on, baby. I want to meet you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great...keep breathing, Becky....\u201d</p><p>Of course you can do it. Come on. We both can.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>IT\u2019S A GIRL.</p><p>It\u2019s a little girl, with scrunched-up petal lips and a tuft of dark hair and hands in tiny fists, up by her ears. All that time, that\u2019s who was in there. And it\u2019s weird, but the minute I saw her I just thought: It\u2019s you. Of course it is.</p><p>Now she\u2019s lying in a plastic crib beside my bed in a gorgeous little white Baby Dior babygro. (I wanted to try a few different outfits on just to see what suited her, but the midwife got a bit stern with me and said we both needed our sleep.) And I\u2019m just staring at her, feeling fuzzy from the broken night, watching every rise and fall of her breath, every squirm of her fingers.</p><p>The birth was...</p><p>Well, it was what they call \u201cstraightforward and easy.\u201d Which really makes me wonder. It seemed pretty complicated and bloody hard work to me. But anyway. Some things are best left a blur. Births and Visa bills.</p><p>\u201cHi. You\u2019re awake.\u201d Luke looks up from where he\u2019s been dozing in a chair and rubs his eyes. He\u2019s unshaven and his hair is askew and his shirt is all rumpled.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I can\u2019t help a smile licking across my face as I look at her again. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is perfect. You\u2019re perfect.\u201d His face has a kind of distant euphoria even as he\u2019s looking at me, and I know he\u2019s reliving last night.</p><p>In the end, just Luke stayed in the room, and everyone else went out to wait. And then they went home, because Dr. Braine said it would be a long while before anything happened. But it wasn\u2019t! It was one thirty in the morning when she was born, and she looked all bright-eyed and alert, straightaway. She\u2019s going to be a party girl, I know it.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have a name yet. The list I made is discarded on the floor beside the bed. I got it out last night when the midwife asked what we were going to call her \u2014 but all the names I\u2019d thought about are wrong. They\u2019re just...wrong. Even Dolce. Even Tallulah-Phoebe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s a gentle tapping at the door.

I just...\u201d I gulp, wiping my nose. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Suze sits down on the edge of the bed, her face full of dread. \u201cBex...was it really awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d I shake my head, struggling for the words. \u201cI had no idea I\u2019d feel so...happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, that.\u201d Suze\u2019s face lights up as if in memory. \u201cYou do. It doesn\u2019t last forever, mind you.\u201d She seems to think again and gives me a tight hug. \u201cIt is amazing. Congratulations. Congratulations, Luke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He smiles. Even though he looks knackered, he\u2019s glowing. He meets my eye and I feel a catch in my heart. It\u2019s like we have a secret together, which no one else can quite understand.</p> <p>\u201cLook at her little fingers....\u201d Suze is bending over the crib. \u201cHello, darling!\u201d She looks up. \u201cDoes she have a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I adjust myself on the pillows, wincing a little. I feel pretty mashed up after last night. Although the good thing is, the epidural hasn\u2019t completely worn off yet, and they\u2019ve already given me a stash of painkillers.</p><p>The door opens again, and Mum appears. She\u2019s already met the baby, at eight this morning, when she arrived with brioches and hot coffee in a flask. Now she\u2019s laden with gift bags and Dad is following in her wake.</p><p>\u201cDad...meet your granddaughter!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh, Becky, darling. Congratulations.\u201d Dad gives me the hugest, tightest hug. Then he peers into the crib, blinking slightly harder than normal. \u201cWell, then. Hello, old girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere are some clothes for you, Becky, love.\u201d Mum heaves an enormous weekend bag stuffed full of garments onto a nearby chair. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what you\u2019d want, so I just rooted around....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Mum.\u201d I undo the zip and pull out a chunky cable cardigan which I haven\u2019t worn for about five years. Then I glimpse something else. A familiar pale blue glimmering, beaded, velvety softness.</p><p>My scarf. My precious Denny and George scarf. I still remember the first instant I clapped eyes on it.</p><p>\u201cHey look!\u201d I pull it out, careful not to snag any of the beads. I haven\u2019t worn this for ages, either. \u201cRemember this, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember!\u201d Luke\u2019s face softens as he sees it. Then he adds, totally deadpan, \u201cYou bought it for your Aunt Ermintrude, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cTragic that she died before she could ever wear it.

I still can\u2019t quite believe we have a daughter.</p><p>Meet our daughter, Tarragon Parsley Sage and Onion.</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Luke pushes a hand back through his rumpled hair. \u201cIn two weeks\u2019 time we\u2019re homeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut on the streets!\u201d I say lightly. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess you expected to marry someone who could put a roof over your head, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s joking, but there\u2019s a wryness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cOh well.\u201d I shrug, watching the baby\u2019s hand unfurl like a little starfish. \u201cBetter luck next time...\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence and I glance up. Luke seems genuinely stricken.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019m joking!\u201d I say hastily. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just had a baby. You should have a home. We shouldn\u2019t be in this position. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault!\u201d I grab his hand. \u201cLuke, we\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll make a home wherever we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get us a home,\u201d he says, almost fiercely. \u201cBecky, we\u2019ll have a wonderful house, I promise you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know we will.\u201d I squeeze his hand tight. \u201cBut honestly...it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not just saying that to be supportive.(Even though I am a very supportive wife.) It really, truly doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Right now, I feel like I\u2019m in a kind of bubble. Real life is on the other side, miles away. All that matters is the baby.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d I say, as she suddenly yawns. \u201cShe\u2019s only eight hours old and she can yawn! That\u2019s so clever!\u201d</p><p>For a while we both gaze into the crib, awestruck, hoping she might do something else.</p><p>\u201cHey, maybe she\u2019ll be prime minister one day!\u201d I say softly. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be cool? We could get her to do all the things we wanted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t, though.\u201d Luke shakes his head. \u201cIf we tell her to do them, she\u2019ll do exactly the opposite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s such a rebel!\u201d I run a finger down her teeny forehead.</p><p>\u201cShe has her own mind.\u201d Luke corrects me. \u201cLook at the way she\u2019s ignoring us now.\u201d He sits back on the bed. \u201cSo what are we going to call her? Not Grisabella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Rhapsody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Parsley.\u201d He picks up 1,000 Girls\u2019 Names and starts flicking through it.</p><p>Meanwhile I\u2019m just gazing at her sleeping face. This one name keeps popping into my head every time I look at her. It\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s telling it to me.</p><p>\u201cMinnie,\u201d I say aloud.</p><p>\u201cMinnie,\u201d Luke echoes, experimentally. \u201cMinnie Brandon. You know, I like that.\u201d He looks up with a smile. \u201cI really like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinnie Brandon.\u201d I can\u2019t help beaming back. \u201cIt sounds good, doesn\u2019t it? Miss Minnie Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNamed after...your aunt Ermintrude, obviously?\u201d Luke raises his eyebrows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh my God!

Then I smooth back her tuft of hair and kiss her tiny cheek. \u201cWelcome to the world, Minnie Brandon.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>SO IT\u2019S HAPPENED. The Karlssons have moved in to our flat. All our furniture has been packed up and moved out. We\u2019re officially homeless.</p><p>Except not really, because Mum and Dad are having us stay for a while. Like Mum said, they\u2019ve got heaps of room, and Luke can commute from Oxshott station, and Mum can help out with Minnie, and we can play bridge every night after supper. Which is all true, except the playing bridge bit. No way. Uh-uh. Never. Not even with the Tiffany bridge cards Mum bought me as a bribe. She keeps saying it\u2019s \u201csuch fun,\u201d and \u201cAll the young people are playing bridge these days.\u201d Yeah, right.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m too busy looking after Minnie to sit around playing bridge. I\u2019m too busy being a mother.</p><p>Minnie\u2019s four weeks old already, and is a total party girl. I knew she would be. Her favorite time is one in the morning, when she starts saying \u201cra ra ra\u201d and you struggle out of bed, feeling like you only fell asleep three seconds ago.</p><p>Plus she quite likes three in the morning. And five. And quite a few times in between. To be honest, I feel totally hungover and knackered every morning.</p><p>But on the plus side, cable telly is on all night. And Luke often gets up to keep me company. He does his e-mails and I watch Friends with the sound turned low, and Minnie breast-feeds like she\u2019s some starving, deprived baby who wasn\u2019t fed just an hour ago.</p><p>The thing about babies is, they really know what they want. Which I do quite respect. Like, it turns out Minnie doesn\u2019t like the handcrafted crib after all. It makes her all cross and squirmy, which is a bit crap considering it cost five hundred quid. Nor is she impressed by the rocking cradle, nor the Moses basket, even with Hollis Franklin four-hundred-thread-count linen sheets. What she likes best is to be cuddled in someone\u2019s arms all day and all night. And second best is my old carry-cot, which Mum got down from the attic. It\u2019s all soft and worn looking but pretty comfy. So I returned all the others and got a refund.</p><p>I returned the Circus Tent Changing Station too. And the Bugaboo and the Warrior \u2014 in fact, loads of stuff. We don\u2019t need them. We don\u2019t even have a house to put them in. And I gave all the money to Luke, because...well, I wanted to help. Even a little bit.</p> <p>The good news is, things are looking up a tad for Luke. And the best bit of all is that Iain Wheeler lost his job! Luke didn\u2019t hang around \u2014 the day after we had Minnie, he paid a visit to Iain\u2019s bosses, along with his lawyer, and they had a \u201cshort conversation,\u201d as Luke put it. The next thing we heard was that Iain Wheeler was announcing his decision to move from Arcodas. It\u2019s nearly a month later and Gary, who knows these things, says he hasn\u2019t had any job offers yet. Which is apparently because everyone has heard the rumor of some incriminating dossier on him. Ha.</p><p>Luke won\u2019t work with Arcodas, though, even with Iain gone. He says their attitude is just as obnoxious as ever. And he still hasn\u2019t got any money out of them. He\u2019s just closed down another three European offices and things are still pretty tense. But he\u2019s OK. He\u2019s thinking positive, already planning new pitches, new strategies. We sometimes talk about them at night, and I tell him everything I think. And then somehow the conversation always drifts to Minnie and how amazing and beautiful and gorgeous she is.</p><p>And now I\u2019m standing in Mum\u2019s driveway, joggling her in my arms, watching the delivery men unload all our things. Most of our stuff has gone into storage, but obviously there were a few essentials we had to bring with us.</p><p>\u201cBecky...\u201d Mum approaches me from across the drive, holding a teetering pile of old magazines. \u201cWhere shall I put these, love? In the rubbish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not rubbish!\u201d I protest. \u201cI might want to read them! Can\u2019t they go in our bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting a little full....\u201d Mum looks at the magazines and seems to make a snap decision. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have to give you the blue bedroom as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I nod. \u201cThanks, Mum.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We didn\u2019t give up the house without a fight. Luke phoned Fabia to plead with her, and so did I and so did the real estate agent. But they exchanged contracts with the other couple two days after Minnie was born. The only tiny silver lining was that I got my Archie Swann boot back, after I sent Fabia about five threatening e-mails. Otherwise there really would have been trouble.</p><p>\u201cMore shoes.\u201d A delivery guy comes by, carrying a cardboard packing box. \u201cThat fitted wardrobe\u2019s full, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right!\u201d says Mum briskly. \u201cStart filling up the blue bedroom. I\u2019ll show you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Luke comes by in his shirtsleeves, carrying my Pilates ball and two hatboxes.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d I nod, watching a delivery guy carry in my vanity case. \u201cThis is weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty weird.\u201d He puts his arm round me and I nestle into his shoulder. Last night was even weirder, with all the furniture packed up in the van and just a big empty flat filled with boxes. At about four A.M., Minnie just wouldn\u2019t sleep, so I wound up her mobile with the Brahms Lullaby and put her in the baby sling. Luke wrapped his arms round us both and we kind of danced around the room in the moonlight.</p><p>I never realized that song was a waltz before.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d Dad approaches us, holding a pile of post. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s very efficient,\u201d says Luke in surprise. \u201cI haven\u2019t given this address to many people....\u201d He glances at the logo on the back. \u201cAh. It\u2019s from Kenneth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I feign enthusiasm and make a face at Minnie.</p><p>Luke rips open the envelope and scans the text. After a second he peers harder. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he says slowly. At last he raises his head and stares at me in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a duplicate letter in the post for you too. As Kenneth says, it\u2019s quite a big matter, so he wanted to contact both of us.\u201d</p><p>Oh, this is all I need. Letters of complaint from Kenneth.</p><p>\u201cHe hates me!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. All I said was that he was narrow-minded\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d Luke\u2019s mouth twitches into a smile. \u201cBecky...it looks like you beat me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cOne of your investments has done exceedingly well. I\u2019m not sure Kenneth can quite cope with the news, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>I knew it. I knew I\u2019d win.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I demand in excitement. \u201cWhat did well? It\u2019s the Barbies, isn\u2019t it? No, the Dior coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Web site fabbesthandbags.com is going to be floated. You\u2019ll make a stack.\u201d</p><p>I seize the letter and run my eyes down it, taking in words here and there. Three thousand percent profit...extraordinary...unforeseen...</p><p>Ha-di-ha! I beat Luke!</p> <p>\u201cSo, am I the most financially astute and clever person in this family?\u201d I look up in triumph.</p><p>\u201cYour Antiques of the Future are still a worthless pile of crap,\u201d Luke says, but he\u2019s grinning.</p><p>\u201cSo what? I still beat you! You\u2019ve got lots of lovely money, darling!\u201d I kiss Minnie on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhen she\u2019s twenty-one,\u201d Luke puts in.</p><p>Honestly. Luke\u2019s so boring. Who wants to wait till they\u2019re twenty-one?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d I murmur into her ear, pulling the blanket over her head so Luke doesn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d Mum appears in the front door, holding a cup of tea. \u201cThat\u2019s your bedroom pretty much full. But it\u2019ll take an awful lot of sorting out and tidying, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s quite a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d calls Luke. \u201cThanks, Jane!\u201d Mum disappears inside again and he picks up the Pilates ball. \u201cSo, shall we make a start?\u201d</p><p>I loathe sorting out. And tidying. How can I get out of this?</p><p>\u201cActually, you know, I thought I might take Minnie for a walk,\u201d I say casually. \u201cI think she needs some fresh air. She\u2019s been stuck inside all day....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Luke nods. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later! Bye-bye, Daddy!\u201d I wave Minnie\u2019s tiny hand as Luke vanishes into the house.</p><p>I never realized it before, but having a baby is just the best excuse. For anything!</p><p>I put Minnie in her pram, all wrapped up cozily, and tuck Knotty next to her for company. I think Minnie\u2019s quite fond of Knotty, actually. And Double-Knotty, which Jess gave her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019re using the old-fashioned gray pram I got at the baby fair, first of all because I got a bit carried away sending back all the other prams, and secondly because Mum reckons it\u2019s the best one for supporting Minnie\u2019s back, \u201cnot like these newfangled buggies.\u201d I\u2019m planning to get it sprayed hot pink as soon as I can \u2014 only it\u2019s not that easy to find a custom pram paint-sprayer over the festive season.</p><p>I tuck her up in the gorgeous pink-and-white blanket that Luke\u2019s parents gave her when they visited over Christmas. They were so sweet \u2014 they brought me a basket of muffins and invited us to stay (only, Devon\u2019s a bit far) and said Minnie was the most beautiful baby they\u2019d ever seen. Which shows what good taste they have. Unlike Elinor, who hasn\u2019t even visited and just sent Minnie this hideous antique china doll with ringlets and spooky eyes, like something out of a horror film. I\u2019m going to auction it on eBay and put the money in Minnie\u2019s account.</p><p>I put on my new Marc Jacobs coat which Luke got me for Christmas and tie my Denny and George scarf round my neck. I\u2019ve been wearing it all the time since I got out of hospital. Somehow I don\u2019t feel like wearing any other scarf at the moment.</p><p>I always knew it would be a good investment.</p> <p>There\u2019s a little parade of shops quite near to Mum and Dad, and without quite meaning to, I head that way.

Just because it\u2019s a nice walk.</p><p>As I reach the newsagents it\u2019s all warm and bright and welcoming, and I find myself pushing the pram in. Minnie is fast asleep and I head toward the magazine rack. I could get a magazine for Mum \u2014 she\u2019d like that. I\u2019m just reaching for Good Housekeeping when my hand freezes. There\u2019s Vogue.</p><p>A brand-new issue of Vogue. With a bright blue cover line shouting, London\u2019s Yummiest Mummies-to-Be.</p><p>My hands fumbling in excitement, I pull it down, tear off the free travel supplement, and flick through the pages....</p><p>Oh my God! It\u2019s a huge picture of me! I\u2019m standing on the sweeping staircase in the Missoni dress, and the caption reads: \u201cRebecca Brandon, shopping guru and wife of the PR entrepreneur Luke Brandon, is expecting her first baby.\u201d</p> <p>Based in Maida Vale, the text below reads, former TV presenter Becky Brandon\u2019s elegant style is obvious throughout her palatial six-bedroom house. She designed the stunning \u201chis\u201d and \u201chers\u201d nurseries herself, with no expense spared. \u201cOnly the best will do for my baby,\u201d she says. \u201cWe hand-sourced the furniture from a tribe of artisans living in Mongolia.\u201d</p><p>I turn the page \u2014 and there\u2019s another picture of me, beaming as I stand in the fairy-princess nursery, my hands resting on my bump. A big pull-out quote reads: \u201cI have five prams. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too many.\u201d</p><p>Becky is planning a natural water birth with lotus flowers, and is under the care of It-obstetrician Venetia Carter. \u201cVenetia and I are good friends,\u201d enthuses Becky. \u201cWe have such a great bond. I might ask her to be a godmother.\u201d</p><p>It all feels like an age away. Like a different world.</p><p>As I gaze down at the beautiful designer nursery, I can\u2019t help feeling a pang. Minnie would have loved it. I know she would.</p><p>Anyway, she\u2019ll have a lovely nursery one day. Even better than that one.</p> <p>I take the Vogue to the counter and put it down, and the assistant looks up from her magazine.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d like to get this, please.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a new display in the corner with a sign reading GIFTS \u2014 and while the assistant is unlocking the till, I wander over to have a look. It\u2019s mostly photo frames and small vases and a rack of thirties-style brooches.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here before, haven\u2019t you?\u201d says the assistant as she scans my magazine. \u201cOver Christmas you were in all the time.\u201d</p><p>All the time.

I\u2019ll go to that Italian caf\u00e9 where they don\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cShall we go and have a nice cup of coffee?\u201d I turn my steps toward the caf\u00e9. \u201cJust you and me, Min.\u201d</p> <p>As we walk past the antique shop I catch a glimpse of my reflection and can\u2019t help feeling a tiny jolt at the sight. I\u2019m a mother pushing a pram. Me, Becky Brandon (n\u00e9e Bloomwood), an actual mother.</p><p>I turn into the caf\u00e9, sit down at the table, and order a decaf cappuccino. Then, gently, I lift Minnie out of the pram, cradling her soft downy head. I unwrap her pink-and-white blanket and feel a swell of pride as two elderly ladies look over from the next table and start saying to each other, \u201cWhat a dear little thing!\u201d and \u201cWhat a smart outfit!\u201d and \u201cIs that a real cashmere cardigan, do you think?\u201d</p><p>Minnie starts making her snuffling \u201cWhere\u2019s the food?\u201d noises and I give her tiny cheek a kiss. I\u2019m the Mother with the Fabbest Baby in the World. And we\u2019re going to have a blast. I know it.</p><p>Bambino 975 Kings Road</p><p>London SW3</p><p>...for children of all ages...</p><p>Miss Minnie Brandon 5 January 2004</p><p>The Pines 43 Elton Road Oxshott</p> <p>Surrey</p><p>Dear Miss Brandon,</p><p>Congratulations on being born!</p><p>We at Bambino are delighted to celebrate your arrival into the world \u2014 and would like to mark it with a very special offer.
