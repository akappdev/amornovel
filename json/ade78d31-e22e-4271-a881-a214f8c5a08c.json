The wolf within howled with rage, and the man that the world generally saw, well, he felt more than a little pissed, too.</p><p>Collared for a murder he hadn\u2019t committed. Talk about shit-luck. Yeah, Lucas had played on the wild side, he\u2019d even killed before, and the bastards had more than deserved the death he\u2019d given them.</p><p>But this time, for this crime, he was innocent. Right. Like the cops would buy that story.</p> <p>His hands tightened around the bars. If he wanted, he could rip those bars apart, and if they didn\u2019t let him out soon, he would. \u201cI want my lawyer! Now!\u201d His pack had to know where he was. A leader didn\u2019t just vanish, and if he didn\u2019t make contact with them soon, Lucas wasn\u2019t exactly sure what would happen.</p><p>Probably hell on earth . . . or wolves running wild in LA, which, yeah, that equaled hell on earth. Especially if he wasn\u2019t there to keep the wilder wolves on their leashes.</p><p>Everyone already knew that wolf shifters had a tendency to dance on the edge of sanity. Once those leashes were gone . . . hello, hell.</p><p>The bars beneath his fingers began to bend as the rage swelled inside him.</p><p>A human was dead. Tossed on his doorstep like garbage.</p> <p>Not my kill.</p><p>Because Lucas had a rule. Just one. Don\u2019t attack the weak.</p><p>As far as he was concerned, there wasn\u2019t any being weaker than a human.</p><p>\u201cGuard!\u201d His teeth burned as they lengthened in his mouth. No more fucking nice wolf. He was getting out, one way or another. The metal bars groaned within his grasp.</p><p>\u201cSimone!\u201d Not the guard\u2019s voice. The dumbass detective who\u2019d brought him in for \u201cquestioning.\u201d Only he hadn\u2019t been questioned. The cop had just thrown his ass into a cage.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s kind didn\u2019t do so well with cages.</p> <p>He\u2019d make sure the detective didn\u2019t make the same mistake again.</p><p>His eyes lifted, tracked to the left to meet that beady gray stare\u2014</p><p>And instead got caught by a pair of green eyes.</p><p>His nostrils flared. The woman stood behind the detective, a slight frown between her brows. She was tall, curved just the way he wanted a woman to be, with sensual, full breasts and hips that would let a guy hold on tight for a wild ride.</p><p>Pretty face. Straight nose, tilted just a bit on the end\u2014kinda cute. A light spray of freckles across her high cheekbones. Sexy red lips. Jaw that was a bit stubborn.</p><p>And gorgeous hair. A thick mane of dark, dark brown hair that curled around her face.</p><p>Her stare widened as he gazed at her. She licked her lips, a quick swipe of her tongue.</p><p>His cock began to swell, an immediate and instinctive response, even as suspicion rose within him. What was the sexy little human doing at his cell? Was she another cop? A lawyer?</p> <p>Her eyes\u2014the greenest he\u2019d ever seen\u2014stayed locked on his. That emerald stare didn\u2019t waver at all. Not even to glance toward the right, to lock on the jagged remains of his ear.</p><p>Most women looked. Like they couldn\u2019t help it. Looked, flinched. So did the men.</p><p>Lucas had never really given a damn. The top of his ear had been ripped off years ago in the worst fight of his life. He\u2019d been ten at the time.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t look.</p><p>A guard came scurrying into the holding area, keys loose and jingling in his right hand.</p><p>\u201cGet him out.\u201d The order came from Detective Dickhead.</p><p>Lucas let go of the bars, even as he tried to chain the beast that demanded he lunge for the ass\u2019s throat.</p><p>Playing it civilized sucked.</p><p>The door opened seconds later with a harsh moan.</p><p>The woman smiled\u2014with her lips, not her eyes. \u201cLover . . .\u201d A sexy purr of sound.</p><p>He felt that purr run the length of his body, even as the lie burned in his mind. He knew he\u2019d never been this lady\u2019s lover.</p><p>Not yet, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free to go, Romeo,\u201d Detective Dickhead drawled. \u201cYour lady gave you an alibi for last night, one that we were able to back up with accounts from three other witnesses.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>Last night, he\u2019d gone running solo. He\u2019d let the wolf out so that he could howl and hunt as much as he wanted.</p><p>He\u2019d come home with the taste of blood on his tongue, and then he\u2019d found blood staining his front steps.</p><p>Lucas rolled his shoulders, trying to force the tension back, and stalked out of the cage. Then she was in his arms. Throwing herself against him. Wrapping slender arms around his neck and pressing her mouth to his.</p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t a stupid man. If a sexy woman wanted to plaster her curves against him, he wasn\u2019t gonna argue.</p><p>But he was most certainly gonna take.</p><p>His hands lifted, caught her, locked right around the firm flare of her ass, and he pressed her closer. His mouth took hers, his tongue plunged deep.</p><p>Oh, but she tasted sweet.</p><p>Not the wild tang of his kind. Women who could shift into the powerful form of a beast usually tasted like aged wine.</p><p>She tasted like candy.</p><p>He\u2019d always had a sweet tooth.</p><p>Her tongue moved against his, soft strokes, like a kitten, licking. A moan trembled in her throat.</p><p>His cock strained against the front of his jeans. Okay, so he didn\u2019t know who she was. Not gonna stop him. Because he\u2019d sure like to screw h\u2014</p><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d Dickhead again.</p><p>The woman in his arms stiffened.</p><p>For show. He knew she hadn\u2019t forgotten the detective\u2019s presence. And neither had he. Lucas just hadn\u2019t given a damn that they were being observed.</p><p>\u201cSorry I wasn\u2019t here sooner.\u201d Her voice was husky, sexual. Like a silken stroke right over his groin.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, babe.\u201d He curved his fingers under her chin. Two could play. He saw the small tremor that shook her, and he smiled. Deliberately, he let her see the sharp edge of his teeth. Way sharper than a human\u2019s.</p><p>But no fear flashed in her eyes.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>The lady knew the score, he\u2019d stake his pack\u2019s reputation on that fact. She knew he wasn\u2019t human. Probably knew exactly what he was.</p><p>And she was still coming to his aid.</p><p>Now, as a rule, Lucas didn\u2019t believe that people were good. No, he knew they were more apt to be influenced by the devil than any pure motivation, so he figured the lady had an angle.</p><p>\u201cThe Los Angeles police department apologizes for any inconvenience,\u201d the nasal voice of Dickhead told him.</p><p>Lucas released the woman. Gently, he pushed her to the side. His eyes narrowed as he cocked his head and waited for Dickhead to finish.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you have a known history of affiliation with certain\u2014\u201d</p><p>He moved in one quick lunge. Lucas grabbed the detective, lifted the jerk by his too-thick throat, and slammed him against the bars.</p><p>The guard stepped forward.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s head snapped to the right. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d Guttural. Because really, a guy\u2019s patience could only last so long.</p><p>The guard\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He glanced back at the detective. \u201cBruce, I think you and I need to clear the air.\u201d So others were there watching\u2014big deal. He wouldn\u2019t play subtle. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a hard-on for me. You been dodging my feet for the last two months.\u201d He let the beast show in his eyes. Lucas knew the glow of the wolf would burn from his blue stare. \u201cYou stay out of my way from now on or you\u2019ll find out just what I do to bastards who piss me off.\u201d</p><p>The detective\u2019s skin bleached. \u201cYou\u2014you can\u2019t threaten a cop\u2014\u201d</p><p>He let his claws dig into Bruce\u2019s flapping flesh. \u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d A whisper.</p><p>His smile faded. \u201cSomeone\u201d\u2014something\u2014\u201cyou don\u2019t want to have as an enemy.\u201d His fingers loosened. The detective slid from his grip. Dropped to the floor. Probably pissed himself.</p><p>Lucas glared down at the man. He let Bruce see the intent in his eyes. Then he caught the woman\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Sarah King let the tall, dark wolf shifter drag her down the twisting hallways of the police station. Her heart slammed into her chest with every step and her palms slickened with sweat. And her knees\u2014it was a good thing he was doing all the dragging, because they were shaking so hard she might not have been able to walk so well on her own.</p><p>Lucas Simone. The badass of the LA wolf pack.</p><p>She wondered if the detective knew just how close he\u2019d come to serious injury.</p><p>You didn\u2019t mess with a wolf. Shifters, in general, were considered wild because of the beasts they carried inside. Unpredictable. Five times stronger than humans. Senses\u2014hearing, sight\u2014more like an animal\u2019s than a man\u2019s.</p><p>Because they were more animal than man.</p><p>Shifters were part of the Other. Humans didn\u2019t know it, but they were living in a nightmare. A world inhabited by vampires, demons, djinn\u2014every creature imaginable and some that folks didn\u2019t want to imagine.</p><p>The wolf shifters were said to be the worst. Too powerful. And quite often . . . insane. A not-so-nice little side perk of their genetics.</p><p>Oh, yeah, the detective had come close to\u2014</p><p>Lucas shoved open the glass door at the entrance of the station. Nobody made the mistake of getting in his way.</p><p>Evening sunlight hit her hard. Sarah blinked, trying to adjust her eyes, but Lucas didn\u2019t pause. The wolf just kept dragging her. Down the stone steps. Across the street, into the park that was overgrown with weeds, then back into the stretching shadows of the trees.</p><p>Uh, oh. Time to stop. Sarah wrenched her hand free.</p><p>The shifter turned on her with narrowed blue eyes.</p><p>All the moisture in her mouth dried up in an instant.</p><p>Lucas Simone was dangerous. One glance at his stony expression could tell any fool that.</p><p>The guy was big, towering well over six feet, muscled, with wide shoulders. Freaking linebacker shoulders.</p><p>No way was he handsome. His face was all angles. His cheekbones were too sharp. His jaw too square, too hard. His lips were too thin, a little too cruel.</p><p>And his eyes were too hard, that fierce gaze saw too much.</p><p>Dangerous. Wild.</p><p>No, Lucas Simone definitely wouldn\u2019t classify as handsome, but Sarah really wasn\u2019t the type to be swayed by a pretty face.</p><p>She was much more the I-need-a-freaking-badass-to-save-my-ass right-now type.</p><p>\u201cI should explain . . .\u201d She began, clearing her throat.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should.\u201d An order.</p><p>Her own eyes narrowed. \u201cUh, I think it\u2019s important to note that I saved your hide back there.\u201d Very, very important to note. In fact, she was wagering on the old wolf pack code to help her out. The I-Scratch-Your-Back, You-Protect-Mine code.</p><p>He grunted. \u201cI didn\u2019t need saving, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d The wolf would still be caged if it hadn\u2019t been for her\u2014and the folks she\u2019d bribed. Using the last of my cash.</p><p>She needed shelter. Her growling stomach reminded her that she also needed food.</p><p>And she desperately needed some serious muscle.</p><p>Her gaze dropped down to his chest.</p><p>Muscle, check.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had sex, lover.\u201d He drew the last out, more like a growl instead of a word.</p><p>Sarah couldn\u2019t help it, she flushed. She felt her face heat and knew she had to be beet red. The curse of her fair skin. She always blushed too fast. \u201cYou were in jail. They were pinning a murder rap on you.\u201d Facts that really shouldn\u2019t have to be pointed out to the ungrateful wolf. Come on. Where was her thank you?</p><p>\u201cI remember every woman I\u2019ve had sex with,\u201d he continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. His eyes, hooded, swept over her, making her cheeks burn all the more. She\u2019d dressed, deliberately chosen the sexy attire, before going down to the station. Her red blouse plunged to reveal the swell of her breasts. The short, black skirt revealed a long expanse of leg. Her sandals were small, curved, and designed more to be sexy than serviceable.</p><p>He whistled slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you.\u201d</p><p>Right, and she didn\u2019t buy for a minute that the guy remembered every woman he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cSome women like to take things slow. They like to kiss, they like to stroke. Others like to strip, to fuck, as fast as possible.\u201d A pause as his eyes rose back to hers. \u201cThey like it rough because they like the rush of being with a monster.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and took a quick step back, unable to help herself because Lucas looked very, very threatening.</p><p>\u201cAre you one of those women?\u201d He moved forward, closing that distance. His hand lifted and traced her cheek. \u201cDo you like the thrill of walking on the wild side?\u201d</p><p>Her heart was racing. Her knees were knocking again\u2014well, okay, they\u2019d never stopped. She licked her lips and managed, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared, and the grin that curved his lips was grim. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. Shifter senses. Some said their senses were acute enough to catch a lie. Not to actually smell a lie, but to hear the jerk of an increased heartbeat or to scent the sweat that broke through the skin at a lie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turned on right now,\u201d he told her, voice so rough that she almost shivered, \u201cjust like you were when we kissed outside that damn cage.\u201d</p><p>Now what was she supposed to say to that? Especially since the guy was right?</p><p>His hand slid down her face and his fingers curled over her throat. His palm pushed against her pulse. He didn\u2019t hurt her, not like he\u2019d hurt the cop, but Sarah tensed, knowing just how dangerous he could be.</p><p>I saw the photos. He\u2019s killed before. Without remorse. Fast, brutal. I know what he can do.</p><p>That\u2019s why she had come to him.</p><p>When a girl was caught between hell and a hard place, she needed the devil to help her out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d He breathed the words against her. \u201cNot some angel come to save me in my dark hour of need . . .\u201d</p><p>Hardly. She managed to lift her chin. \u201cLet go of me and I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d Almost everything. Okay, not even almost, but at least the important parts.</p><p>A deep laugh rumbled from him. \u201cThink you\u2019re tough, do you?\u201d But his hand fell away.</p> <p>She sucked in a sharp breath. Tough? Not anymore. \u201cSarah. I\u2019m Sarah King.\u201d Her name would tell him nothing. It wasn\u2019t who she was that mattered. No, it was what she was.</p><p>\u201cAnd what brought you to my cell, sweet Sarah?\u201d</p><p>Now this was the tricky part. \u201cI saw your story on the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you decided to run down to the station and give a killer an alibi?\u201d One brow rose. \u201cWhat a good Samaritan you are.\u201d The sarcasm dripped all over her.</p><p>Her hands clenched into fists. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill John.\u201d</p> <p>Now he was the one to tense. \u201cJohn,\u201d he repeated the name softly. \u201cYou knew him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d The words snapped like a whip. \u201cYou might think you know about the supernaturals in this world, but you don\u2019t. We\u2019ve got secrets\u2014secrets humans can\u2019t even begin to guess.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cI heard the way you said his name. You knew him.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and she didn\u2019t like thinking about John\u2019s death. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d He looked around them, his gaze sweeping to the left and the right.</p><p>They probably shouldn\u2019t stay out in the open much longer. She knew she had to make this quick. She had to get Lucas to take her with him and to keep her by his side. Day and night.</p> <p>Sarah exhaled slowly. \u201cJohn was at your house because he wanted protection.\u201d True.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was being hunted and he knew that you could keep him safe.\u201d Knew, hoped, same thing.</p><p>If only Lucas had been home in those early hours before dawn. Then her friend wouldn\u2019t be dead, dammit, and she wouldn\u2019t be on her own again.</p><p>Life sucks. Deal with it\u2014and try to keep living. Her mantra since she was seventeen.</p><p>\u201cKeep him safe . . . from what?\u201d</p><p>A twig snapped. Sarah jumped but Lucas didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cSquirrel,\u201d he said softly, without even looking.</p> <p>She was nervous as all hell. It was starting to get dark, and she knew exactly what kinds of creatures came out once the darkness trickled across the sky. \u201cWe should go . . . get out of the open.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cI\u2019m not the running type.\u201d</p><p>If you were one of the baddest of the bad, you didn\u2019t have to run. You could stay and fight and kick some good old ass.</p><p>But, if you were human or . . . a weaker supernatural, you learned early that it paid to run. And run fast.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d Lucas demanded. \u201cWhy was that guy\u2014John\u2014coming to me for protection?\u201d A line pulled down his brows and his right hand rose to rub along the jagged edge of his ear. \u201cPack protects pack, but that wasn\u2019t shifter blood dripping down my steps.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. Be strong. Life sucks, just like vampires. Yeah vamps were real, too. All the monsters that people feared\u2014they existed.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s hand dropped. \u201cHe was human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t.\u201d Time for her big confession. \u201cAnd neither am I.\u201d Okay, just say it. \u201cLucas, I need you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. Then he jerked her behind him in a move she barely felt, much less saw. \u201cLucas? What\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>She heard the growl then. The hair-raising sound came from the thicket of trees that Lucas faced, hands loose at his sides, his body still.</p><p>The dark hadn\u2019t fallen yet.</p><p>But it looked like the monsters had decided it was time to come out and play.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>They sprang from the bushes, bodies tense, fur up, snarls on their lips. Two coyotes with muddy brown coats and red-rimmed eyes. Saliva dripped off their teeth. Their bushy tails brushed the ground as they crouched, preparing to attack.</p><p>Oh, damn, damn, damn.</p><p>Sarah grabbed the back of Lucas\u2019s shirt. Her nails ripped through the fabric. \u201cYou need to shift!\u201d What was the guy waiting for? Two against one! Not the best odds. They didn\u2019t have time to waste. The change from man to beast wasn\u2019t instantaneous and those coyotes were less than ten feet away and\u2014</p><p>They attacked.</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t bother screaming. She bent low, her fingers automatically going for her ankle sheath. The knife might not be much, but it was all she had. And the weapon had saved her ass more than a few times.</p><p>Lucas grunted when the first beast came at him. He didn\u2019t retreat, didn\u2019t so much as stumble. He just lifted his arm, caught the coyote around the neck, and threw him against a tree.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, and Sarah blinked, realizing he wasn\u2019t talking to her. He was inviting the second shifter\u2014because Sarah knew they weren\u2019t being attacked by simple animals, no, these creatures had the minds of men\u2014to attack.</p><p>Inviting the attack? Maybe the wolf shifter was psychotic, after all. Figured. That would be her luck.</p><p>The beast\u2019s pointed ears twitched. He let out a loud barking cry, then he sprang forward.</p><p>Lucas raised his hand and his claws\u2014claws that Sarah had hoped never to see so close to her\u2014sank into the coyote\u2019s body.</p><p>The creature fell, hard, his body thumping into the ground as blood darkened his brown fur.</p><p>Color her impressed. Sarah pushed her knife back into the sheath and rose quickly. \u201cNice job.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced back at her and growled.</p><p>The wolf was in his eyes, glowing brightly. Lucas might not have shifted fully, but he\u2019d definitely let his beast off the leash a bit.</p><p>The bloody coyote pushed to his feet with a whimper.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Lucas demanded as his gaze flew back to the other shifter. \u201cYou bastards know who I am and you know you\u2019re damn well supposed to stay out of my territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Lucas . . .\u201d Her eyes searched the thick brush. They only had about thirty minutes of sunlight left, if that much. \u201cCan we please get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, these assholes are gonna shift and explain exactly why they attacked\u2014\u201d He took a step forward, turning slightly as he held up his hands, and Sarah saw the waning light glint off the claws extending from his fingertips. \u201cOr I\u2019m gonna skin \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>As far as threats went, Sarah thought that one was pretty good. Mostly because she knew that Lucas meant exactly what he\u2019d said.</p><p>The coyote shifters must have known it, too. The creature who\u2019d been tossed against the tree gave a half-hearted howl, and, as Sarah watched, fascinated and horrified at the same time, his body began to change. No matter how many times she saw a shift, she\u2019d never get used to the brutal transformation. Bones snapped. Fur disappeared. His muzzle shortened. His ears flattened.</p><p>In moments, a man stood before her. Tall, thin, skin tanned a deep brown, and, of course, naked.</p><p>His head was bowed. Shaggy brown locks of hair covered his face. The pose was one of submission\u2014like Lucas was gonna buy that. She inched to his side. The better to watch.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you attack me?\u201d Fury vibrated in Lucas\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cNot you.\u201d One long, bony finger lifted and pointed toward her. \u201cThe woman.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps rose along her arms. \u201cWe really need to get out of here.\u201d So the bastard had followed through on his threat. He\u2019d put a price on her.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s blue eyes focused on Sarah. \u201cWhy are you after her?\u201d</p><p>She held his stare. She\u2019d explain everything to him when they were somewhere nice and safe and out of the open.</p><p>The coyote shifter said, \u201cThere\u2019s two hundred grand being offered for her.\u201d</p><p>No, being offered for her dead body. But, of course, the jerk coyote wasn\u2019t going to admit that part. Surely Lucas understood though, he knew these games.</p><p>\u201cLucas . . .\u201d His name slipped past her lips. She couldn\u2019t look away from his eyes. Okay, this wasn\u2019t his fight, so maybe he probably should just turn his back on her and walk away.</p><p>But if he did that, she might as well just jump into a grave. Without a pack to aid her in this mess, she wouldn\u2019t survive. All her allies had vanished. Or been killed.</p><p>\u201cI saved you at that jail,\u201d she reminded him, and dammit, that was partly true. \u201cPack law says you owe me now.\u201d She licked her lips and tasted her fear. \u201cHelp me.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t beg. Not yet, anyway. But maybe in about five more minutes, if more of those smelly coyotes burst from the bushes and came at her with claws and teeth.</p><p>Lucas stared down at her. Watching. Weighing. After one very long moment, his gaze tracked down her body. No expression passed across his face.</p><p>\u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>When his gaze rose again, he inclined his head in the faintest of moves, then he turned his attention back to the coyote.</p><p>Oh, Christ, please let that have been a yes.</p><p>Lucas crossed his arms over his chest and glared at the trembling man. \u201cYou caught my scent the minute you crept into the park.\u201d</p><p>The shifter glanced up at him from beneath thick clumps of hair.</p><p>\u201cYou knew I was a wolf.\u201d Lucas\u2019s lips curled down in a hard frown. \u201cAnd I\u2019d bet that you knew exactly who I was.\u201d A pause. \u201cBut you attacked anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer! Not you\u2014her!\u201d</p><p>The snarl that burst from Lucas had the guy stumbling back. \u201cShe was with me, and you attacked.\u201d Lucas shook his head. \u201cWrong move, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Sarah straightened her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t ever, ever come at me again with bloodlust in your eyes and teeth bared, you understand?\u201d The words vibrated with rage. \u201cIf you do, I guarantee it will be the last fucking mistake you ever make.\u201d</p><p>The shifter gave a quick nod.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, and take your dog,\u201d Ooh, big insult that, the coyotes hated being called \u2018dogs\u2019, \u201cwith you.\u201d</p><p>The guy scrambled. He grabbed the bleeding coyote and tossed the \u201cdog\u201d over his shoulders. That second shifter had to be injured pretty badly if he hadn\u2019t been able to transform back to human form.</p><p>Lucas waited for the man to turn away with his bleeding buddy before saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got your scents now. You\u2019ll have two hours to get out of town. If I see you after that\u2014you\u2019re both dead.\u201d</p><p>The shifter broke into a run.</p><p>\u201cAnd you . . .\u201d He slanted a dark glance her way. \u201cPack protection doesn\u2019t come as cheaply as you seem to think. I don\u2019t give a shit about the old laws.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach dropped. \u201cIf you don\u2019t help me, then I\u2019m the dead one.\u201d</p><p>A shrug.</p><p>What? \u201cYou can\u2019t be that cold of a bastard. I need your help, and I\u2019ve traveled over seventeen hundred miles to find you.\u201d Just like John had. Hopefully, her quest wouldn\u2019t end the same way.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to die.</p><p>Sarah sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI know who set you up for murder. If you give me protection, I\u2019ll give him to you.\u201d</p><p>Both brows rose. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll most definitely give him to me, one way or another.\u201d</p><p>Her back teeth clenched. \u201cI could have left you in jail,\u201d she gritted.</p><p>A hard smile. \u201cAnd I could have let the coyotes have you.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. Okay, he had a point there. A rather nasty, cold-hearted one, but . . .</p><p>\u201cYou must have done something pretty bad to get a price on your head.\u201d</p><p>Not really. She\u2019d actually tried to do something good. That just hadn\u2019t worked out so well.</p><p>\u201cSarah King . . .\u201d He drew out her name, as if tasting it. \u201cAre you a bad woman?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Don\u2019t trust me. She bit back the words. Now really wasn\u2019t the time for that much honesty between them. So she didn\u2019t speak but she managed to hold his stare.</p><p>After a moment, he lifted his hand and offered it, palm-up, to her. \u201cOnce you come with me, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>The heated look in his eyes told her he wasn\u2019t just talking about a few days of protection.</p><p>But right then, she would have traded what was left of her soul to walk away with Lucas Simone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d The rumors she\u2019d heard over the years, about humans being absorbed into the packs\u2014women, mostly, who disappeared after they were linked with male shifters\u2014those stories drifted through her mind once more.</p><p>Some wolf shifters roamed on their own. The Lones. Some Lones existed in society, blending almost seamlessly with the humans. But most of the Lones didn\u2019t blend so well. They had breakdowns. They\u2019d been known to go on killing rampages. Often, they were tagged as serial killers and put down.</p><p>The rest of the wolves . . . they were pack. Pack was sacred. Pack was strong.</p><p>What would she have to do in order to belong? What would she have to sacrifice?</p><p>And did it matter?</p><p>Sarah took Lucas\u2019s hand and kissed her old life good-bye.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t take the woman back to his house on Bryton Road. The place was probably still crawling with cops and reporters, and he didn\u2019t feel like dealing with all that crap.</p><p>He called his first in command, Piers Stratus, to let him know that he was out of jail and to tell him that there were two unwanted coyotes in town.</p><p>The woman\u2014Sarah\u2014didn\u2019t speak while he drove. He could feel the waves of tension rolling off her, shaking her body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was scared. She\u2019d done a fair job of hiding her fear back at the police station and then at the park, at first anyway. But as the darkness had fallen, he\u2019d seen the fear. Smelled it.</p><p>Sarah had known she was being hunted.</p><p>He pushed a button on his remote. The wrought-iron gates before him opened and revealed the curving drive that led to his second LA home. In the hills, it gave him a great view of the city below, and that view let him know when company was coming, long before any unexpected guests arrived.</p><p>When the gate shut behind him, he saw Sarah sag slightly, settling back into her seat. The scent of her fear finally eased.</p> <p>Like most of his kind, he usually enjoyed the smell of fear. But he didn\u2019t . . . like the scent on her.</p><p>He much preferred the softer scent, like vanilla cream, that he could all but taste as it clung to her skin. Perhaps he would get a taste, later.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, he killed the ignition. The house was right in front of them. Two stories. Long, tall windows.</p><p>And, hopefully, no more dead bodies waited on the steps here.</p><p>He eased out of the car, stretching slowly. Then he walked around and opened the door for Sarah. As any man would, Lucas admired the pale flash of thigh when her skirt crept up. And he wondered just what secrets the lovely lady was keeping from him.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in to talk.\u201d An order. He wanted to know everything, starting with why the dead human had been at his place.</p><p>She gave a quick nod. \u201cOkay, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>A wolf bounded out of the house. A flash of black fur. Golden eyes. Teeth.</p><p>Shit. It wasn\u2019t safe for the kid. Not until he found out what was going on\u2014</p><p>The wolf ran to him. Tossed back his head and howled. Sarah laughed softly.</p><p>Laughed.</p> <p>His stare shot to her just in time to catch the smile on her lips. His hand lifted, and almost helplessly, he traced that smile with his fingertips.</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>Lucas ignored the tightening in his gut. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be afraid?\u201d After the coyotes, he\u2019d expected her to flinch away from any other shifters. And Jordan was one big wolf, with claws and teeth that could easily rip a woman like Sarah apart.</p><p>She looked back at the wolf who watched them. \u201cHe\u2019s so young, little more than a kid. One who is glad you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>Understanding dawned, fast and brutal in his mind. I\u2019m more than human. She\u2019d told him that, he just hadn\u2019t understood exactly what she was. Until now.</p><p>His hands locked around her arms and Lucas pulled her up against him. Nose to nose, close enough so that he could see the dark gold glimmering in the depths of her green eyes. \u201cJordan, get the hell out of here.\u201d He gave the order to his brother without ever looking away from her.</p><p>The wolf growled.</p> <p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>The young wolf pushed against his leg\u2014letting me know he\u2019s pissed, \u2019cause Jordan hates when I boss his ass\u2014and then the wolf backed away.</p><p>\u201cNow for you, sweetheart.\u201d His fingers tightened. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just go back to that part about you not being human?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. She had nice lips\u2014sexy and plump. He shouldn\u2019t be noticing them, not then, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. He noticed everything about her. The gold hoops in her dainty ears. The streaks of gold buried deep in her dark hair. The lotion she\u2019d rubbed on her body\u2014that vanilla scent was driving him wild.</p><p>He was turned on, achingly hard, for a woman he barely knew. Not normally a big deal. He had a more than healthy sex drive. Most shifters did. The animal inside liked to play.</p><p>But Sarah . . . he didn\u2019t trust her, not for a minute, and he didn\u2019t usually have sex with women he didn\u2019t trust. A man could be vulnerable to attack when he was fucking.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I am, Lucas,\u201d she said and shrugged, the move both careless and fake because he knew that she cared, too much.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d Her mouth was so close. He could still taste her. That kiss earlier had just been a tease. Want more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a charmer,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>A charmer. The weakest of the paranormals, and, in his mind, the damn sneakiest. Charmers blended the best with the humans. They got to live in the bright, fake world of date nights and football games. They passed as humans all the time, had all the perks of human life, but charmers had magic inside, weak, but still there.</p><p>Charmers were able to communicate telepathically with animals. To \u201ctalk\u201d with them. Each charmer had one type of animal that she or he could talk with\u2014some spoke to bears, tigers, hell, he\u2019d even known one lady down in the South who could talk snake to a Burmese python.</p><p>\u201cWho do you talk to?\u201d Because his suspicion couldn\u2019t be right. No way. It was impossible.</p><p>She bit her lower lip. That sexy, red lip\u2014</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He kissed her. Lucas crushed his mouth against hers and let the hunger take over\u2014the hunger that had been building the whole time he\u2019d been trapped beside her in that SUV, trapped with her soft flesh so close and her sexy scent surrounding him.</p><p>He\u2019d had a piss-poor day. Time to stop playing nice and get back to doing things his way.</p><p>Hard and dirty.</p><p>Her mouth opened, lips quivering. Perfect. His tongue swept inside, driving deep. Her kiss wouldn\u2019t be as good as before. Couldn\u2019t be. He\u2019d imagined that lick of fire, that wild arousal, that\u2014</p><p>His cock jerked. Dammit.</p><p>Her breasts pushed against him, nipples tight and pebbled. The scent of her arousal teased his nostrils, and Lucas realized he was in serious trouble.</p><p>Just as bad as before. No, just as good, and that equaled one big-ass problem.</p><p>Growling, he pulled back. \u201cWho . . .\u201d He swallowed, and tried to sound more like a man than a beast as he demanded, \u201cWho do you talk with?\u201d Who, what\u2014same thing in his world.</p><p>Her lips were red, swollen, and her eyes were so wide. \u201cWolves.\u201d Her voice was husky, tinged with the same need that had him aching.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>A new worry shot through him. \u201cMy kind . . . can you\u2014\u201d He wanted her mouth again. Soon. \u201cCan you read us when we\u2019re in human form?\u201d</p><p>A slow shake of her head. \u201cNo. Only when you\u2019re the wolf.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he believed her.</p><p>But he still freed her and stepped back. Because if he didn\u2019t, Lucas knew he would have taken those lips again, and he wouldn\u2019t have stopped with such a simple taste.</p><p>\u201cGo inside. There\u2019s a room on the second floor, to the right of the stairs\u2014you can use it, for now.\u201d Until he figured out exactly what was happening and how to get the price off her head.</p><p>Why do I care?</p><p>Because she had saved him at the jail. While he\u2019d denied it to her, he did follow pack law. Up to a point.</p><p>Lucas turned away from her. He\u2019d need to send Jordan someplace safe. Until this shit was smoothed over, he wasn\u2019t going to risk his brother.</p><p>He\u2019d almost lost him before. No way was he going to put his brother in harm\u2019s way again.</p><p>\u201cIs having sex with you the price of protection?\u201d</p><p>Her voice froze him. Then anger ripped through his gut. He glanced back at her, frowning. \u201cIf it is?\u201d</p><p>The wind tossed her hair. The moonlight glittered in her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were that hard up, wolf.\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled. Nice bite. He loved women who knew how to fight. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna have sex with me because you want a safe place to hide.\u201d And hiding, yeah, he knew that was what his little charmer was doing. Hiding with the big, bad wolf.</p><p>\u201cGood to know, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have sex with me because you want me, just as badly as I want you.\u201d Immediate attraction. Animal lust\u2014that\u2019s what his kind called it. Sometimes, the beast inside just recognized a perfect sensual partner.</p><p>In bed, he bet they\u2019d be great. He couldn\u2019t wait to have her, naked and hungry, in a big, soft bed. Or maybe out in the open, beneath his glowing moon. Either way, he would have her.</p><p>He paused, waited for her denial.</p><p>Sarah headed for the house. \u201cKeep hoping, wolf.\u201d</p><p>Her arousal, the rich scent of woman, teased his nose. He smiled. \u201cI will, babe, I will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Waking up to find yourself in a wolf\u2019s den wasn\u2019t the best experience, but, hey, it was better than being dead.</p><p>The next day, Sarah crept down the stairs, all too aware of the silence in the house. After he\u2019d dropped his little sexual bombshell, she hadn\u2019t spoken to Lucas again last night. She\u2019d kept silent because, mostly, because he was right.</p><p>She did want him. Arrogant bastard.</p><p>She\u2019d been thinking about him for months. Ever since she\u2019d first seen his picture and heard the tales of the LA alpha.</p><p>His father had been slaughtered when Lucas was ten. Killed by the leader of a rival pack who\u2019d wanted to claim the LA territory.</p><p>If the tales were true, and, after meeting the man, Sarah figured they had to be, Lucas had gone after his father\u2019s killer. He\u2019d attacked a full-grown wolf shifter, in human form\u2014and the form of a ten-year-old boy really wasn\u2019t that tough. Lucas had somehow survived that fight. He\u2019d escaped death and disappeared from LA for six years.</p><p>At sixteen, he\u2019d come back, and the shifter who\u2019d murdered his father had been dead within an hour of his return. In the seventeen years since, he\u2019d been the wolf running these streets.</p><p>So, okay, she had more than a little crush on the guy. A crush that had caused her to risk her ass when she found out he was in danger. She still couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d driven all the way from Arizona to try and save him.</p><p>Well, his life\u2014and her own skin.</p><p>Sarah reached the bottom of the stairs. \u201cHello! Lucas?\u201d He\u2019d better not have gone hunting without her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty in the morning.\u201d His voice came from the right. He stepped from the kitchen, crossed his arms, and studied her. \u201cBut I think I liked the other outfit better.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d tossed on the jeans and t-shirt she\u2019d stuffed into her travel bag. Since her goal today wasn\u2019t seduction\u2014not her main goal, anyway\u2014she\u2019d been glad to get back into her casual clothes.</p><p>Her hands dug into her back pockets. \u201cI\u2014um, thought you had already left.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled. \u201cI\u2019ll be hunting soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t doubt it.</p><p>\u201cConfession time, huh, sweet Sarah?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. They needed to talk today, to plan and to attack. Because, once night fell, she knew more coyotes would be coming after her.</p><p>And him.</p><p>So where should she start?</p><p>\u201cTell me about the dead man.\u201d He leaned back against the doorframe.</p><p>All right. That was one place to start. She cleared her throat. Took a nice slow breath. He\u2019ll know when I lie. Well, he\u2019d know, unless she was very, very careful. \u201cJohn Turner was . . . like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wolf charmer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a charmer, yes, but the coyote was his linked animal. He worked with them.\u201d Because every charmer she\u2019d met had a primary link. Some could pick up thoughts from a few other beasts, but one animal was always primary, with a link so strong it took no effort to form the connection.</p><p>\u201cWorked with?\u201d Lucas repeated carefully.</p><p>Ah, now she had to be very careful because \u201cworked with\u201d was actually a nice euphemism for John\u2019s spy work. When the coyotes got together for their hunts with other factions, John had always been there. Pretending to be a guard, but secretly picking up the thoughts of all the coyote shifters there and reporting back to his coyote leader.</p><p>Charmer spies were valuable commodities in the shifter world. Because when the beasts roamed free, it was so easy to discover what lies the men had been keeping.</p><p>\u201cThe dead guy was spying on coyote packs?\u201d</p><p>Lucas obviously knew the score. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhile he was . . . working, John got word of a planned attack in LA.\u201d No sense sugar-coating. If she hadn\u2019t been so tired lasted night, she would have gotten all this crap out into the open then. But she\u2019d been running on fumes and the minute she\u2019d found the bed, one that held John\u2019s wild scent, she\u2019d crashed.</p><p>It had been the first time she\u2019d slept in the last thirty-six hours.</p><p>\u201cJohn picked up the thoughts of a coyote named Hayden. The guy wanted more power.\u201d Hayden. She\u2019d met the jerk a few times. Squinty eyes. Handsome face. Evil grin. \u201cHe thought if he pulled off a coup here, he could start his own faction.\u201d And then the coyotes could take back the power they\u2019d lost to the wolves in LA.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a pact with the coyotes. They stay out of my space and I stay out of theirs.\u201d Hard. Angry. He wasn\u2019t slumping against the wooden frame any longer. His body stood at full attention, his broad shoulders filling the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI hate to tell you,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut that truce is pretty much worthless.\u201d To Hayden, anyway. \u201cHayden found out that John was onto his plans and he put a price on his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the price that\u2019s on yours?\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, yes. That was the way the coyotes liked to play. A price would be put on prey. Then the hunt would begin.</p><p>She took a quick breath. \u201cJohn thought his best chance of survival was coming here, telling you what was happening . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd getting my pack to watch his ass.\u201d</p><p>The way she hoped they\u2019d watch hers. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He strode toward her. \u201cAnd where do you fit into all this? Why are they after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know the attack isn\u2019t just coming from the coyotes.\u201d Bad enough, but . . . \u201cHayden is working with wolves\u2014they are coming for you, too.\u201d Wolves she knew. Wolves she\u2019d trusted, once. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she\u2019d seen their true nature.</p><p>\u201cA war is coming to this town, Lucas. You\u2019re going to get slammed from both sides.\u201d This time, she sucked in a deep, gulping breath. Confession. \u201cI know the wolf who\u2019s leading the charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow him?\u201d</p> <p>Not going to lie. A lie wouldn\u2019t work with him. She stepped away from the stairs and headed closer to him. \u201cHe was my lover.\u201d He\u2019d also used her to spy. At first, she hadn\u2019t minded. Not like spying was new for her. Besides, she\u2019d been so happy to find someone who didn\u2019t think she was some kind of freak.</p><p>And he\u2019d been a wolf. It had seemed so perfect. As if he were made for her.</p><p>Then the killings had started.</p><p>She\u2019d realized he wasn\u2019t so perfect after all.</p><p>Sarah had gotten away from him, barely, but he was out there, and closing in\u2014on her and Lucas.</p> <p>\u201cYour lover.\u201d A growl. \u201cYou like to play with wolves, do you?\u201d</p><p>Sarah kept her chin up even as her hands clenched into fists. \u201cJohn died trying to save your ass.\u201d</p><p>Black brows rose. \u201cSounds like he died trying to save his own ass.\u201d He walked around her, circling like the wolf he was as he closed in on his prey. His gaze raked her, head to toe, lingering a bit too long on her breasts and hips.</p><p>Sarah was all too aware that they were alone and that Lucas could rip her apart with one swipe of his claws. She knew first-hand just how strong a wolf shifter\u2019s claws could be. The mark on her back had only healed a few weeks ago.</p><p>He circled her once more, then stopped just behind her. His breath stirred the hair near her ear as he said, \u201cTell me the wolf\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Not yet. Because wolves had a tendency to stick together, and she didn\u2019t want to find herself on the outside, with two packs sizing her up. \u201cDo you believe me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe you\u2019ve managed to piss off the coyotes.\u201d</p><p>Not close to being good enough. She turned her head a bit and met his stare. \u201cI\u2019m a charmer. I can read the minds of wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen read my mind.\u201d A taunt, one laced with sensual menace.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI can\u2019t read you when you\u2019re in human form, you have to shift first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard there are only a handful of charmers in the world who can read a shifter\u2019s mind.\u201d The doubt was obvious. \u201cMost charmers stick to real animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters are real animals.\u201d The insult burst out automatically, but she\u2019d seen too much to think otherwise.</p><p>His lips curled, revealing the sharp tips of his canines. \u201cThat we are.\u201d He leaned closer and she caught the soft inhale as he scented her hair.</p><p>Sarah held her body very, very still as his mouth came close to her throat. His lips feathered over her, pressing lightly against the side of her neck.</p> <p>If he wanted, he could rip her throat open. But she knew what this move was about. Damn pack rules.</p><p>Dominance. Submission. Lucas was the freaking alpha, her only hope for living out the next forty-eight hours. So she had to play the game.</p><p>Sarah tipped back her head, baring her throat in a gesture she knew he\u2019d understand.</p><p>A rumble slipped from his mouth and seemed to vibrate on her skin. She felt the light nip of his teeth, and, damn it all, a shot of heat streaked through her body. Can\u2019t want him. Can\u2019t trust him. Can only use him and walk away.</p><p>His tongue swiped over her throat, licking the small wound. \u201cHis scent\u2019s not on you.\u201d</p><p>It took a second for his words to register, a second too long, because Lucas caught her arms and yanked her around to face him.</p><p>He bent toward her, bringing his eyes close to hers. \u201cBabe, I know wolf shifters. If we\u2019re fucking, we\u2019re marking our partners. If you had a wolf lover, his scent would be all over you.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. \u201cOnly if we\u2019d been together in the last month. It\u2019s been four months since I got the hell away from him.\u201d Partial truth.</p><p>His nostrils flared. Smell a lie . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth.\u201d If she said it, maybe he\u2019d buy it. \u201cYou\u2019re in danger, your pack\u2019s in danger and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d His hand lowered and snagged her wrist. \u201cI think a little test is in order.\u201d He pulled her with him.</p><p>What? A test? \u201cLucas\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t stop. His grip was freaking unbreakable, because she really did try every way possible to break it. He led her through the house, dragged her outside, hauled her down the hill\u2014and ignored her shouts to explain what the hell he was doing.</p><p>When they burst through the brush and into the small clearing and four wolves\u2014huge, furry beasts with saliva dripping from their teeth\u2014lunged toward them, Sarah finally understood her little \u201ctest.\u201d</p><p>The wolves circled them. She couldn\u2019t help it. Sarah inched closer to Lucas. Two of the wolves were black. Two were solid white. All looked like they\u2019d been taking some kind of shifter steroids. Way too large for normal wolves. She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what part of your story was true,\u201d Lucas said, \u201cand what part was bullshit.\u201d</p><p>He freed her wrist. Then the guy stepped away from her. Far away. He left her in the middle of that circle of wolves and the animals closed in.</p><p>\u201cThe bitch made contact with Simone.\u201d</p><p>The coyote leader lifted his brows at that. \u201cSo she\u2019s dead?\u201d Good. One less worry for him. Of course, picking up the bounty on her head would have been a nice bonus, and killing her would have given them a good in with the other wolves but . . .</p><p>The coyote shifter in front of him raised his head, and the guy\u2019s thick, dirty brown hair scraped across his shoulders. \u201cSimone didn\u2019t kill her,\u201d Marcus DePaul confessed.</p><p>Very, very slowly, Jess Ortez lowered the shot glass he\u2019d lifted to his mouth. \u201cHe didn\u2019t kill her,\u201d he repeated softly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her . . . so what the fuck happened to Sarah King?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSh-she\u2019s under his protection. They were together. I-I followed \u2019em to the park, tried to get her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. His head began to throb. \u201cYou weren\u2019t stupid enough to attack when Lucas Simone was there.\u201d</p><p>But the idiot\u2019s trembling lips told him that, yes, he had been. Fuck. The glass started to crack. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a truce with him!\u201d He threw the glass back over the bar.</p><p>\u201cBut Alpha, I thought you wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jess lunged forward and caught the shifter\u2019s head in his hands. He stared into Marcus\u2019s eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t think.\u201d One twist, that\u2019s all it would take and he\u2019d snap the wiry bastard\u2019s neck. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to think. You\u2019re just supposed to do whatever the hell I tell you.\u201d</p><p>That was the whole point in being the coyote alpha, right? He gave the orders, all the other bastards rushed to obey, and if they didn\u2019t rush fast enough, he killed them.</p><p>Sweat trickled down the dumb bastard\u2019s face. \u201cP-please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Lucas know I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t th-think\u2014\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened.</p><p>\u201cNo! He just\u2014he must have figured we were just hunting! Said if he saw me or Grimes again, we were dead.\u201d</p><p>Not as bad as it could be, but still . . . now the wolf would be on guard and if that bitch managed to get him to believe her story . . .</p><p>Screwed.</p><p>He drew in a long, slow breath. \u201cGuess what?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Marcus blinked his watery eyes. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are dead.\u201d His hands yanked hard to the right.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>Lucas watched the wolves close in on her, and he crossed his arms over his chest. And waited.</p><p>Sarah stood in the middle of that tight circle, her body tense, her hands fisted at her sides. Her gaze darted from wolf to wolf, and the scent of sweat and fear teased his nose.</p><p>Again, the smell of fear didn\u2019t tempt his wolf. But, it did have the beast inside snarling . . . and damn if he didn\u2019t want to go back to her. Protect.</p><p>\u201cThis should be easy for you,\u201d he called out, deliberately keeping his voice cool and expressionless. \u201cYou\u2019re the charmer. Just tell me what they\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed together. So he wouldn\u2019t see the tremble? Too late, he\u2019d already seen. Sarah was scared. Charmers didn\u2019t usually fear their linked animals, but then wolf shifters weren\u2019t your typical beasts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already played this game,\u201d she gritted. \u201cYou were there, you saw me with the boy.\u201d</p><p>The boy. Jordan. \u201cAll you did was guess that he was a young wolf. Not a very impressive guess.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThis time, I want details.\u201d Proof. \u201cTell me what they\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>Because if she really was what she claimed to be . . .</p><p>Her right hand lifted and her index finger pointed to the white wolf that stood less than a foot away from her. \u201cPiers here thinks this test is a damn waste of time, and he wants to go for my th-throat.\u201d</p><p>The drumbeat of Lucas\u2019s heart echoed in his ears. Could be a guess. Everyone knows my first-in-command is Piers.</p><p>Lucas lifted a brow. \u201cYou\u2019ve got three other wolves still waiting,\u201d he said.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t looking away from Piers. \u201cTell him to stand down. I don\u2019t want this jerk taking a swipe at me.\u201d She backed up a step. Not the brightest move. You didn\u2019t show weakness to a wolf. Wolves liked weakness too much.</p><p>Lucas dropped his hands and rolled his shoulders. \u201cEase back, Piers.\u201d</p><p>The white wolf immediately backed off.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s green gaze rose to meet his. \u201cThank you.\u201d No mistaking the fear in those eyes.</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cThree more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really are a bastard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they say.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cRight, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d Her gaze shot to the left. To the big, black wolf with night-black eyes. \u201cHe says you\u2019re a bastard, but you\u2019re a fair bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael.\u201d Her breath heaved out. \u201cHe says I shouldn\u2019t worry, that you don\u2019t usually eat women.\u201d</p><p>Then her face flushed. A dark, fiery red. Her gaze darted to the other white wolf, Caleb McKenzie. He was a little smaller than Piers. Just a little. \u201cHe says you\u2014ah\u2014in bed . . .\u201d Her hand lifted and shoved back a heavy mass of her hair. \u201cI don\u2019t need to know this.\u201d</p><p>Lucas never looked away from her. \u201cOne wolf to go.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cDane knows I\u2019m telling the truth, so he\u2019s trying to keep his mind blank now so I can\u2019t see inside.\u201d A brittle laugh. \u201cNo dice, Dane, and yes, I do think more coyotes will be after me. I think they\u2019ll be here by nightfall and we need to stop screwing around with these stupid tests and get ready for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShift,\u201d Lucas ordered.</p><p>Sarah threw up her hands. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>Too late. The snap and crunch of shifting bones filled the air. Fur melted away from the bodies of the wolves as dark, golden flesh appeared. Hands formed from paws. Muzzles slid back into the curved features of men.</p><p>Didn\u2019t take long. Just a few minutes, and the wolves were gone. Naked men stood surrounding Sarah. Lucas bent toward the bag Piers had brought out earlier. He pulled out the jeans and tossed them to his men. Then he marched to Sarah\u2019s side. The pulse at the base of her throat beat far too fast.</p><p>\u201cYou play with us,\u201d he murmured as the men dressed, \u201cbut we scare the hell out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me on this, Lucas,\u201d she said, voice quiet, \u201cif I could have chosen, wolves would have been the last animals I would have linked with.\u201d</p><p>But charmers didn\u2019t have a choice. Their gift just kicked in when the right animal was around.</p><p>His gaze was on the faint mark on her throat, his mark, when he asked, \u201cWas she telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to rip her throat out,\u201d Piers admitted. \u201cYeah, she knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe plucked the exact words from my mind,\u201d Michael Montoya said. \u201cWe all know what a fair bastard you are.\u201d</p><p>A snort from Piers.</p><p>Dane Gentry edged closer. \u201cShe can link with us.\u201d He whistled. \u201cWho the hell would have thought the stories were true? A charmer who can link with shifted wolves\u2014that\u2019s fucking rare.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders were so straight they had to hurt. \u201cSo I guess this means I passed your test? You believe me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019re a charmer.\u201d His hand lifted and brushed against her back. \u201cI believe that\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Sarah had leapt away from him. When his fingers touched the base of her back, she yelped and shot forward, running and slamming right into Dane\u2019s outstretched and scarred arms.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, sweetheart,\u201d Dane murmured, \u201cthere ain\u2019t no cause for you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She kneed him in the groin. Dane immediately dropped his hold and stumbled back, swearing.</p><p>Sarah whirled back around to face Lucas. He raised his hand, a command for the others to stand down. Don\u2019t touch. He knew terror when he smelled it. They all did.</p><p>\u201cAre all wolves the same?\u201d she asked, voice tight. \u201cSure, I know most folks say you\u2019re all psychotic killers, but, hell, some of you have to be normal, right? Some of you have to have consciences?\u201d</p><p>He caught the faint tightening of Piers\u2019s eyes. Years ago, they\u2019d had to put down Piers\u2019s father when the guy went Lone\u2014and went on a five-state killing spree.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not all fucking psychos,\u201d Piers snarled.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d And one brow arched. \u201cThen why were you so worried a minute ago that you\u2019d be crossing the line and killing? Why are you afraid that you\u2019ll like the taste of human blood too much and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Piers lunged toward her.</p><p>Lucas stepped in front of Sarah. \u201cYou don\u2019t touch her.\u201d Guttural. Suddenly, the tension was so thick he could feel the beast stretching beneath his skin.</p><p>Piers glared at him, his light green eyes a mix of fury . . . and fear. The guy wasn\u2019t afraid of Lucas. No, Piers was afraid of what he might become.</p> <p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t want me looking,\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice came from behind him, quavering just a little, but still with a fuck-you air that he liked, \u201cthen you shouldn\u2019t have been one of the guinea pigs who tested me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t glance back at her, not yet. He kept his gaze on Piers. \u201cYou back in control?\u201d</p><p>A grim nod.</p><p>\u201cGood. Stay that way.\u201d Then he turned to Sarah. \u201cI want the wolf\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, but she shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cHis name. If the bastard is gunning for me, I\u2019m taking him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need assurance first.\u201d She rocked back on her heels. \u201cI need to know that you won\u2019t throw me to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolves?\u201d He finished, and let his mouth curl. \u201cCan\u2019t promise you that, babe.\u201d The wolves already had her.</p><p>\u201cPromise me . . . promise me that you\u2019ll keep me safe. You\u2019ll keep the coyotes and the wolves off my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t imagine why they want to tear into you,\u201d Dane muttered, and from the corner of his eye, Lucas saw the guy wince. Yeah, a sore cock could make any guy wince.</p><p>\u201cThe name,\u201d Lucas said again, not about to be distracted.</p> <p>But Sarah actually shook her head, at him. \u201cYour promise first. I want you to vow right in front of your pack.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she was pushing him. He leaned in close, towering over her. He let the tips of his claws burst through his fingertips, then those claws scraped lightly over the flesh of her arms. Not cutting the skin, but the threat was there. \u201cI could always make you tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cyou can\u2019t. You\u2019re not the first wolf who\u2019s thought he could break me.\u201d</p><p>Now what the fuck was that about? \u201cThe name.\u201d He wanted to know the bastard who\u2019d hurt her, who\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the wolf after you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Was it the same asshole who\u2019d hurt her? Her lover? Talk about piss-poor taste in men.</p><p>\u201c\u2014once you make the vow.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hands, not even leaving a scratch on her. \u201cI give my word that you have my protection.\u201d</p> <p>He was aware of Piers and Dane both tensing at that. Sarah studied him silently for a moment, then said, \u201cNot that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the big, bad asshole who can claw his way through just about anything and anyone, but . . . I want your whole pack\u2019s protection, not just yours.\u201d</p><p>Pushing . . .</p><p>\u201cBecause if you happen to eat a silver bullet, I want to know that my ass is still covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he bit out. \u201cGive me the name, and you have the pack\u2019s protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d she asked, nibbling a bit at her lower lip. \u201cThis could go on for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Piers muttered. \u201cNo, he damn well didn\u2019t just say\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Sarah was smiling now. A real, wide flash of her lips that made the corners of her eyes crinkle and for an instant, she went from pretty to full-on gorgeous. \u201cThen we\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d She offered her hand to him.</p><p>What? Now she wanted a fucking handshake?</p><p>He grabbed her hand. Curled his fingers around her delicate bones. Stared at her mouth as she breathed the words, \u201cRafael Santiago. Rafe.\u201d</p><p>He knew the wolf. His fingers tightened around Sarah\u2019s and he pulled her in even closer. \u201cTime to seal our deal.\u201d Then he put his mouth on hers. Sarah\u2019s lips were open, parted just right, and his tongue plunged inside. Her mouth was as soft as before, as lush, and her taste\u2014</p><p>Still just as fucking sweet.</p><p>With every lick, every stroke of his tongue, he wanted more. The woman was meeting him head-on for the kiss. No shy backing away. Need and lust. Just what he wanted.</p><p>His cock shoved against the front of his jeans. If they hadn\u2019t been surrounded by an avid audience, he would have pushed the kiss farther and taken so much more. But . . . they did have an audience, and he\u2019d never been the sharing kind. Just a little longer and he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>She tore her mouth from his. Her breath panted in ragged puffs and her eyes met his.</p><p>He almost smiled at her. \u201cNow, we have a deal.\u201d One he would have preferred to seal while they were naked in bed, but they\u2019d get around to that part. He just had to stir Sarah\u2019s need enough, then she\u2019d come to him.</p><p>Her gaze darted to the other wolves. \u201cWhat do we\u2014what happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I get ready to hunt.\u201d He inclined his head toward Michael. \u201cTake her back inside.\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded and stepped forward.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s gaze searched his. \u201cThey\u2019ll be coming for me soon.\u201d Sooner than she realized. \u201cThen they\u2019ll have to get through me if they want you.\u201d</p><p>Those eyes of hers were so deep. The greenest he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t thank me yet. She didn\u2019t realize how she fit into his plan. She would. Soon enough.</p><p>Sarah turned away and followed Michael back down the worn path. He watched them for a while, no, watched her, until she was out of sight.</p><p>Piers opened his mouth to speak\u2014and Lucas raised his hand, quieting him.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s hearing wouldn\u2019t be as good as a wolf\u2019s, but he wasn\u2019t taking chances.</p><p>He waited a minute. Two. Then he nodded for Piers to speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking?\u201d Piers demanded. \u201cWe can\u2019t trust her, not for a damn minute.\u201d</p><p>Lucas stared at him. \u201cWatch the tone, Piers.\u201d</p><p>Piers inhaled and his hands unclenched. \u201cWhat do you know about her? We can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know she\u2019s a charmer who can read the minds of shifted wolves,\u201d Dane interrupted. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a real rare talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA talent that could be very useful to us,\u201d Caleb added, the drawl of his native Texas sliding in and out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cOr very dangerous.\u201d Piers yanked a hand through his hair. \u201cAny time we\u2019re in wolf form, she\u2019ll be able to get in our heads, to find our secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no secrets in a pack,\u201d Lucas told him quietly watching his first closely. \u201cOr are you worried she\u2019ll discover something I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>A muscle jumped in Piers\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cEvery time we meet with the other wolves, she\u2019ll be able to tell us what they think.\u201d Caleb smiled, showing off his still-sharp teeth. \u201cHell, yeah, we\u2019ll watch her back forever, because we can keep her forever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think the woman is gonna be \u2018kept\u2019?\u201d Dane interrupted, then whistled. \u201cMy aching cock says, uh, hell, no, that lady ain\u2019t doin\u2019 nothin\u2019 she don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t. Too much fire to be controlled. But then, he\u2019d never cared about controlling his lovers. Not his style. He just went for the passion and the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI want a full check done on Rafe Santiago,\u201d he said, bringing the pack back to the issue that mattered most. \u201cI want to know where the asshole is,\u201d real doubtful the guy was out of state, like he should be, \u201cand I want to know who the hell is supporting him.\u201d</p><p>Piers and Dane nodded.</p><p>Lucas stabbed a finger at Caleb. \u201cYou still got a source at the ME\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, if you mean am I still sleeping with the night clerk? Then no, Kelly and I broke up.\u201d</p><p>Lucas kept staring at him.</p><p>\u201cBut she has hooked up with Michael,\u201d Caleb said quickly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he can use the . . . uh . . . connection to get us in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I want to see that human\u2019s body. I want to know if wolves got him or if the coyotes tore him up and left him on my doorstep.\u201d Either way, there\u2019d be payback. The painful kind that left a trail of blood for miles.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks the coyotes are gonna be coming after her.\u201d Caleb scratched his chin. \u201cBut they won\u2019t be dumb enough to come right on your turf\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s nostrils flared as he turned his head and looked out over the city. \u201cOh, yeah, those assholes will be dumb enough to come.\u201d Because they wanted the woman too much to let her go. He glanced at the dark shifter near his side. \u201cDane, one more thing . . .\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted.</p><p>\u201cFind out just how much of a bounty is really on her head.\u201d Had to be high, high enough for the coyotes to risk death. He exhaled, \u201cAnd make sure word gets spread that anyone coming after her will find the LA wolf pack standing in the way.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d made a deal with sexy Sarah, and he\u2019d hold up that deal . . . for now.</p><p>But not forever.</p><p>Because he knew a lie when he scented one, and Sarah had smelled of deception.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>\u201cStay inside.\u201d</p><p>Sarah whirled around at the snarl and found Lucas in the doorway. His claws were out and the sharp edges of his teeth peeked behind his lips. Uh, oh. Not a good sign. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cCoyotes.\u201d</p><p>The glass slipped from her hand and crashed on the kitchen floor. It shattered at her feet. \u201cAl-already?\u201d She shot a glance to the window. Oh, damn, the sky was turning red. Bloody, with the setting sun.</p><p>Lucas crossed the room with a long, gliding stride. He caught her arms and lifted her up, holding her close against his chest.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe glass . . .\u201d</p><p>She glanced down. The glass hadn\u2019t hit her feet. Like the wound would have bothered her. What was a little scratch compared to the hell she\u2019d been through?</p><p>No. Can\u2019t tell him that. Can\u2019t let him see . . .</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and kept her lashes low, the better to shield her gaze. \u201cThank you.\u201d She breathed the word against his neck and felt the hard stiffening of his body against hers.</p><p>He carried her over the glass. Held her lightly, moved easily. And she was no lightweight. But then, the guy did have shifter strength.</p><p>He put her down just outside the kitchen. \u201cGo upstairs.\u201d Her body brushed against his. His pupils flared, but he said, \u201cWhatever you hear, whatever you see . . . just stay inside, understand?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t an idiot. If coyotes were outside, um, yeah, she\u2019d be staying inside. But she didn\u2019t rush up the stairs, not yet. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cI\u2019m not the one you need to worry about.\u201d</p><p>Right. Big, tough badass. \u201cThey\u2019ll . . . lie to you. They\u2019ll tell you stories about me, about the things I\u2019ve done.\u201d Some of those stories would be true, but Lucas wouldn\u2019t know that. No way could he know that.</p><p>But he just shook his head and eased away from her. \u201cBabe, they\u2019re coyotes. That means they were born to lie.\u201d</p><p>Most Other said that about all the shifters. The shifters were the ones born with two faces, some even thought two souls. Born to deceive.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t turn me over to them?\u201d The question slipped out.</p><p>His eyes burned a bit, the blue heating with the fire of the beast. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got plans for you.\u201d</p><p>Not the giant reassurance she was hoping for. \u201cYou think you can use me, too, don\u2019t you?\u201d Now why did that bother her?</p><p>\u201cYou mean like you\u2019re using me?\u201d</p><p>Hit. Damn the wolf.</p><p>\u201cI think we can use each other.\u201d</p><p>The words should have been cold, hard, and they should not have sent a shiver of sexual awareness over her. But they did.</p><p>\u201cSure you can\u2019t read my mind?\u201d he murmured and that bright stare slipped down her body.</p><p>Didn\u2019t have to be a mindreader to know what he was thinking. \u201cNot in human form.\u201d She\u2019d never been able to read a wolf shifter while he was human. If she had, she wouldn\u2019t have been in this current mess.</p><p>A howl echoed outside. His lips firmed. \u201cGo upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I get a weapon? I mean, you\u2019ve got guns somewhere in this place, right?\u201d Even he would know that sometimes claws and teeth weren\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving you a weapon.\u201d He turned away and strode quickly toward the foyer.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d she called after him.</p><p>He fired a quick glance over his shoulder. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t trust you. You might use it to shoot me in the back.\u201d</p><p>Pretty good reason.</p><p>He reached for the doorknob. She ran for the stairs.</p><p>The leader of the Mexico coyote pack was a tall, wiry bastard named Jess Ortez. They\u2019d tangled a few times in the past, managed to reach a truce, a rocky one, but usually they stayed out of each other\u2019s way.</p><p>Since Jess was on his doorstep, the coyote was doing a real piss-poor job of staying out of Lucas\u2019s way then. Of course, Lucas had known that the coyote would be coming\u2014he\u2019d even left orders for the coyote and his men to be allowed past the gate.</p><p>Jess raised his hands when Lucas walked down the main steps. \u201cAmigo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave the bullshit.\u201d Dane and Piers appeared at Lucas\u2019s sides. Other wolves were in the shadows, waiting. \u201cJust tell me why your ass isn\u2019t below the border like it should be.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s wide smiled dimmed a bit. He glanced back at the two pickup trucks behind him and straightened his shoulders. Always had to put on a big front when pack was watching. \u201cI came to pay you my respects.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour respects?\u201d He stalked forward, aware that Piers and Dane had his back. Always. \u201cTwo of your men attacked me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d Jess lifted his hands, palms out. Probably trying to look defenseless. Failing because the tips of his claws had already broken through the flesh. \u201cThey didn\u2019t attack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have fooled me,\u201d Lucas drawled.</p> <p>Jess\u2019s dark eyes narrowed. \u201cThey just wanted the woman.\u201d The coyote made a real bad mistake then. He glanced up, his gaze zeroing in on the third upstairs window. The window that was in Sarah\u2019s room. He\u2019d caught her scent.</p><p>Lucas lunged forward and grabbed the bastard around the throat. He lifted Jess up, letting the shorter man\u2019s feet dangle above the ground. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting her.\u201d</p><p>The coyotes in the pickup trucks growled.</p><p>Jess\u2019s hands flew up and his claws sliced into the flesh on Lucas\u2019s forearm. Lucas didn\u2019t let him go. His blood splattered to the ground.</p><p>The coyote\u2019s face began to turn purple. Easy to see that change, even in the waning light. Lucas tightened his hold on Jess\u2019s neck, letting the coyote know he didn\u2019t have control here.</p> <p>Jess\u2019s eyes burned into his.</p><p>Slowly, taking his sweet time, Lucas released the coyote. Jess sucked in deep gulps of air. \u201cB-bring \u2019em!\u201d</p><p>He tensed at that, knowing this wasn\u2019t gonna be pretty. He wanted to glance up at that third window. To see if Sarah was there. She\u2019d be watching, peeking through the curtains, and he didn\u2019t want her to witness this.</p><p>Michael had damn well better be doing his job.</p><p>Two coyotes jumped from the back of the first gleaming pickup. They were carrying a long tarp. A tarp that had been rolled up, tight.</p><p>Two more coyote climbed from the second pickup. They had a tarp, too.</p> <p>Jess watched him, those black eyes studying Lucas closely. \u201cMy pack owed you an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did. That\u2019s why I let you past my gates.\u201d</p><p>Jess grunted, and motioned with his right hand. The tarps were both tossed at Lucas\u2019s feet.</p><p>What was happening? Sarah squinted through the crack in the curtain, trying to see below. Some coyotes had jumped out of the trucks. Were they going to attack Lucas? Were they pissed that he\u2019d choked their leader?</p><p>\u201cYou need to come away from the window.\u201d</p><p>She jumped at the voice and spun around. Michael. His long, black hair brushed the collar of his shirt and his dark eyes bore into her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be outside?\u201d Protecting Lucas\u2019s back. Too many coyotes were out there. They way outnumbered the wolves she\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d He filled her doorway. \u201cYou\u2019re not. Step away from the window.\u201d</p> <p>A chill skated down her spine. Her fingers slid over the soft edge of the curtain.</p><p>\u201cThe coyote alpha already has your scent. He knows exactly where you are.\u201d Michael\u2019s brows rose. \u201cAnd just in case one of those dogs out there has a gun, you need to move away from that glass.\u201d</p><p>Right. Gun. The weapon she\u2019d wanted. She hurried forward. But still wondered . . . what had been in those tarps?</p><p>Jess\u2019s claws cut through the ropes that bound the tarps. \u201cThey were hunting the woman. She\u2019s got one real high price on her head.\u201d He glanced back at Lucas. \u201cYou\u2019ve come into my territory following a hunt, and I never stopped you.\u201d</p><p>Right. \u201cI never attacked you during the hunt.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cTrue.\u201d He sliced through the tarps. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I brought you a little present.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s gaze dipped to the open tarps\u2014to the two dead men who\u2019d been gift-wrapped for him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give the order for them to come at you,\u201d Jess spoke quietly. \u201cThey broke the pact we had. The punishment for that was their lives.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be coming for \u2019em anyway, so I figured I\u2019d just save you the trouble.\u201d</p><p>The men\u2019s faces had already taken on the stark white of death. From what Lucas could see, their bodies had stiffened with rigor. They\u2019d died hours ago. Then been hauled out to him.</p><p>\u201cOur pact stands.\u201d Jess stepped over the bodies. Offered his hand.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t take it. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m getting tired of bodies being dumped on my doorstep.\u201d</p><p>Jess kept his hand up. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the bodies with us.\u201d And the coyotes hurried forward to drag them away. \u201cI just wanted to give you proof, wolf. All my pack understands, you\u2019re not to be touched.\u201d</p><p>But Sarah was fair game?</p><p>Lucas smiled and reached for the coyote\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cCan you\u2014can you hear what they\u2019re saying?\u201d Sarah asked because the curiosity was killing her.</p><p>Michael\u2019s brows rose. \u201cYou think my hearing is that good?\u201d</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Michael shrugged and walked back toward the window.</p><p>\u201cWait! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t wait. He brushed back the curtain and stared down below.</p><p>\u201cBullets, man, bullets!\u201d Why should she need to give him the reminder?</p><p>He grunted and lifted one strong shoulder. \u201cThe glass is bulletproof.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cThen why the scare tactics?\u201d She inched closer. \u201cWhy make me pull back?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her. Just gazed below. \u201cBecause I knew Lucas wouldn\u2019t want you seeing the bodies.\u201d</p><p>The bodies. Her breath caught in her throat. She\u2019d seen her share of the dead over the years. But . . . \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s killing them, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Michael\u2019s dark head cocked to the right. \u201cNow . . . now he\u2019s shaking the coyote alpha\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>She rushed forward and shoved the wolf out of her way. I\u2019ll be damned. They were shaking hands. Her own fist slammed into the glass. Of course, it didn\u2019t break\u2014not the glass anyway. But her hand started throbbing like a bitch.</p><p>\u201cGlad that\u2019s settled,\u201d Jess murmured. \u201cNo sense in bloodshed between our packs.\u201d</p><p>Not when my wolves can kick your ass so easily.</p><p>\u201cNow, about the woman . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucas tightened his hold on the coyote\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>The faint smile faded from Jess\u2019s lips. He tried to pull his hand back. No dice. When it came to physical strength, Lucas could take the coyote any damn day. But when it came to underhanded backstabbing, no one beat Jess.</p><p>Well, usually no one did.</p><p>Jess stopped tugging his hand and his eyes began to glow with the light of the coyote. \u201cI want her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, do you?\u201d</p><p>Those glowing eyes rose and locked on window number three. \u201cJust have your man send her down. We\u2019ll be even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven?\u201d He yanked the coyote closer. \u201cNot even fucking close,\u201d he growled in Jess\u2019s ear. Then he let the shifter go.</p><p>Jess stumbled back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have her, and you\u2019ll have the bounty on her head.\u201d Lucas shook his head. \u201cWhy should you get all that cash?\u201d</p><p>But Jess locked his muscles and stood his ground, and, once more, his gaze drifted to the window. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the money. The bitch owes me, and she will bleed for me.\u201d</p><p>The hell she would. \u201cPretty soon someone will be bleeding,\u201d Lucas murmured, \u201cbut it won\u2019t be her.\u201d In one move, he could slice open the coyote\u2019s throat. One fast move. Then his men could take out the others.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you take her in?\u201d</p><p>Behind Jess, the coyotes tossed the bodies back into the pickups.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe I was in the mood for a fuck.\u201d \u201cBullshit. You think you can use her.\u201d Jess laughed at that and spat on the ground. \u201cShe\u2019ll be the one doing the using. And she\u2019ll turn on you, just like she turned on her last lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe?\u201d</p><p>His eyelids flickered. \u201cKnow that, do you?\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cShe shoved a silver knife into his chest. Another inch and she would have taken his heart.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. Not quite the delicate little flower she appeared to be. Good.</p><p>\u201cShe also killed a coyote.\u201d Jess pointed to the window. This time, Lucas glanced up, too. He saw Sarah, her palm pressed against the glass. \u201cShe and that charmer lover of hers\u2014they set him up and they fucking killed him.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s stare met Lucas\u2019s.</p><p>After a moment, he turned back to Jess. But Jess was still looking up at her, and pointing with his claws out. \u201cI owe her payback. That bitch is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, \u201cshe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck you say! You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took care of the men who attacked me.\u201d He smiled and let his fangs flash. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the one who murdered your man.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019ll kill her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes death is the easy part,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Jess laughed at that, a low, rumbling laugh that groaned in his throat. \u201cDamn straight. Make her suffer.\u201d</p><p>So it really wasn\u2019t about money for the coyote. It was about pain. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cNow, Jess, I hope you don\u2019t mind . . .\u201d Actually, I don\u2019t give a shit if you do. \u201cBut get the fuck off my land.\u201d</p><p>Jess jerked his head, but didn\u2019t move. \u201cI\u2019ll want proof.\u201d</p><p>The guy just kept pushing. \u201cYou\u2019ll have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly enough time to play.\u201d</p><p>Jess locked his teeth and gritted, \u201cTomorrow night.\u201d Lucas inclined his head. \u201cDeal.\u201d So this was what it felt like when you bargained with the devil.</p><p>Jess spun away and headed for the first truck. Giving his back as a target really wasn\u2019t his brightest move. But then, Jess had never claimed to be a genius, just a tough coyote who\u2019d once sold out his own brother so he could take the position of pack alpha.</p><p>Loyalty. Didn\u2019t it matter anymore?</p><p>Jess climbed into the passenger side of the truck. Raised his hand. The trucks roared to life and the tires spun on the gravel drive. Lucas was aware of Dane moving toward the trees. Moving fast.</p><p>Good. Dane would follow the coyotes. He\u2019d watch them, and he\u2019d see just who the bastards were aligning with in this town.</p><p>When the dust cleared, he turned back to face the house. Piers stood a few feet behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou believe anything he said was true?\u201d He jerked his thumb back toward the house. \u201cDid she really kill a coyote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Not like he could judge. He\u2019d killed a coyote, too. And so had Jess . . . funny that the bastard was demanding vengeance when he\u2019d just killed two of his own men.</p><p>Of course, Sarah was human. Pack took care of pack, but when humans tried to hunt . . .</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Rafe?\u201d Piers whistled. \u201cYou buy that she went after him with a silver knife?\u201d</p><p>Now that gave him pause. \u201cWe didn\u2019t search her when she came in.\u201d The woman had looked so defenseless. Fucking mistake on his part.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Piers\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou think she\u2019s still got the knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m not going to be taking any more chances with our charmer.\u201d He glanced back up at that window and found her gaze on him. \u201cNo chances at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coyotes left.\u201d And there hadn\u2019t been a giant, all-out brawl below her. She exhaled on a hard breath that fogged the glass. \u201cThat\u2019s great, right?\u201d</p><p>Michael didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>She turned and elbowed him. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDane\u2019s following them.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back through the window, squinting. Night was falling so fast now, she could barely see anything. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to see if the coyotes really are teaming up with Rafe.\u201d Lucas\u2019s deep voice filled the room.</p><p>Sarah whirled around. \u201cYou shook his hand.\u201d She\u2019d seen that part clearly, and she\u2019d taken the punch right in her gut. \u201cI told you that the coyotes wanted to take you out and you stood there and shook a coyote alpha\u2019s hand?\u201d She marched toward him, anger humming through her. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be such an easy mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Deadly quiet.</p><p>Wait\u2014was that some kind of warning about the coyotes or was he saying\u2014</p><p>\u201cGet out, Michael. Get to work with Piers.\u201d</p><p>Michael nearly ran out of the room. When the alpha says jump . . . You say how fucking high. Rafe\u2019s words drifted through her mind as goosebumps rose on her arms. \u201cWhat happened to the bodies?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, just the tiniest bit. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have seen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Michael had made sure of that. Did they really think she was that fragile? If they only knew. \u201cDid you kill them?\u201d</p><p>He leaned in close and his breath feathered over her cheek as he said, \u201cYou tell me. Am I a killer?\u201d</p><p>Yes. That\u2019s why she wanted him. No, why she needed him.</p><p>He laughed, and the husky rumble just made the goosebumps worse. \u201cThis time, I didn\u2019t have to lift a hand. The coyote alpha\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jess Ortez. Yeah, she knew the lying asshole.</p><p>\u201c\u2014he wanted to make up for . . . offending me. To show that our deal was still in place, he killed the two coyotes who came after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour deal?\u201d And the two coyotes from the park were dead? She swallowed. Don\u2019t think about it, don\u2019t! They would have killed you in a heartbeat. Hell, they would have, if Lucas hadn\u2019t been there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI stay in California.

He leaned in close and his lips pressed lightly against the base of her throat. \u201cDid you kill a coyote on your way to find me?\u201d</p> <p>The tip of his tongue lapped her skin. Her hands flew up and caught his shoulders. Held tight. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His fingers eased down her shirt, pausing in the hollow between her breasts. \u201cYou sure about that? Jess seemed pretty certain you and your charmer lover murdered his coyote.\u201d</p><p>Her charmer lover? \u201cJohn wasn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>The back of his hand brushed her breast. She sucked in a sharp breath and realized she had a death grip on his shoulders. Sarah forced her hands to ease their tight hold. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t my lover.\u201d Her voice came out too husky and soft.</p><p>\u201cBut Rafe was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d So she had a weakness for bad boys. A weakness that was lifting its head again. Didn\u2019t you learn anything before? Bad boys were fun for a while, until they turned on you.</p> <p>His hands were on her body, steady, strong. He eased her back, walking slowly, until her legs bumped against the bed.</p><p>\u201cYour lover put a bounty on your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t take rejection well.\u201d True, but he also hadn\u2019t wanted her to get away from him, not when she knew so much.</p><p>\u201cUm . . .\u201d That growling rumble vibrated from deep in his chest. \u201cHow much are you worth to him?\u201d</p><p>His fingers skated down her bare arms. The flesh seemed hypersensitive to his touch. \u201cTwo hundred grand.\u201d</p><p>One brow rose.</p><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s what the coyotes said, you heard them in the park\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoyotes lie.\u201d His lips brushed the hollow of her throat. \u201cAnd I think you do, too, babe.\u201d</p> <p>True. But was lying to protect yourself so wrong? \u201cThree hundred grand.\u201d That really was the truth.</p><p>\u201cDead?\u201d He asked quietly, the whisper at her throat. \u201cOr alive?\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me, it matters one hell of a lot.\u201d Then he moved, fast, pushing her down and Sarah\u2019s back hit the soft mattress. She didn\u2019t have time to twist or jump out of the way because he was on her instantly, covering her with his body and trapping her on the bed.</p><p>\u201cPlaytime\u2019s over,\u201d he told her, no sensual heat in his eyes. Just hard, cold wolf.</p><p>His voice might have been arctic, but the body pressing against hers seemed to burn with fever, and there was no mistaking the fierce bulge of his cock as it pressed against her.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s hands shoved at his shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught her wrists, held them tight in one hand, then he twisted and his right hand shot down to the bottom of her jeans. Oh, shit, no, he knew.</p><p>It only took about two seconds for his fingers to find the ankle sheath. His eyes glittered down at her.</p><p>Fear dried her mouth. \u201cL-Lucas . . .\u201d I can explain stuck in her throat.</p><p>He pulled out her knife. The light glinted off its sharpened edge. \u201cI\u2019m guessing the blade is made out of silver.\u201d He turned the knife a bit, inspecting it. Then he stretched over her again. The strong hand that held her wrists jerked high, forcing her hands over her head.</p><p>And he brought the knife in close. \u201cIt is silver, right?\u201d Not the handle, or his flesh would be burning, but . . . \u201cYes, the blade is silver.\u201d The knife was way too close to her throat for comfort.</p><p>What do you know about him? The voice of doubt she\u2019d heard all during that long drive to LA.</p><p>What did she know?</p><p>That he was a killer.</p><p>That he led the most vicious wolf pack on the West Coast. That he\u2019d fought a band of vampires to free his brother. Loyal. He might be a walking nightmare to some, but Lucas had protected Jordan. She\u2019d heard that story about him, managed to steal that tale from the minds of the wolves. Lucas had attacked a Born Master Vampire\u2014and Born Masters were the strongest of those blood-sucking vamps\u2014for his brother. He\u2019d risked his life to save Jordan\u2019s.</p><p>A guy who did that couldn\u2019t be all bad. Right?</p><p>But that blade was so close to her throat.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever used this knife on anyone?\u201d</p><p>He already knew the answer. He\u2019d known that she had the knife, so that meant the coyotes had told him about her and Rafe. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn your lover?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cTell me, did Rafe put the bounty on your head before or after you tried to take his heart?\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t looking good. She sucked in a breath, tried to exhale, and realized her breasts were crushed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cBefore . . . or after, Sarah?\u201d Harder now, angrier.</p><p>\u201cAfter.\u201d Dammit.</p><p>His gaze seemed to bore into hers. \u201cSo you come here, you tell me that a rival wolf is out to kill me, that he\u2019s put a bounty on your head, but you neglect to mention that you drove a silver knife into the guy\u2019s chest?\u201d He rose above her and his fingers tightened around the knife. \u201cIs this some damn setup? Do you get off on pitting two wolves against each other?\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. \u201cLucas!\u201d</p><p>He threw the knife. It flew, end-over-end, and embedded hilt-deep in the far wall.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you attack him, Sarah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was trying to kill me,\u201d she snarled because she was afraid and she was tired and she was angry. Why? Why\u2019d this hell happen to her? \u201cWhen a six-foot-four asshole comes at me with claws and fangs, I\u2019m going to fight back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just happened to have a silver knife? Handy, having that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn gave me the knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you to use it on Rafe?\u201d</p><p>And on you, if it comes to that. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe coyotes just swore they had my back,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe alpha killed the two men who attacked you\u2014he wanted to make amends for their actions.\u201d</p><p>Death was the way to make amends? A shiver worked over her flesh.</p><p>\u201cRafe has never come at me,\u201d Lucas said, \u201cNever attacked. I haven\u2019t even heard a whisper that he\u2019s eyeing my territory.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see anything but him. He was all around her. Hard muscles. Angry eyes. Dark, rumbling voice.</p><p>The faint lines around his eyes deepened. \u201cBut you come here, and you sneak in a silver knife. What were you planning to do? Wait for a moment when I\u2019m weak? Maybe try to stab me when I sleep so you can take me out?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>His head lowered and his mouth feathered over hers in the lightest of kisses. She hadn\u2019t expected the sensual touch and heat flooded through her. Even now . . . want him.</p><p>The adrenaline in her blood was spiking. The anger and fear mixed with the need the man could stir too easily. His mouth . . .</p><p>Sarah tried to pull back.</p><p>His tongue licked her lip. \u201cTell me . . . did you think you\u2019d fuck me and slip past my guard?\u201d</p><p>Her head lifted. She caught his lower lip with her teeth. Nipped him. Hard. Time for him to see that she could bite, too. \u201cNo, dammit.\u201d The driving need trembled in her voice.</p><p>His tongue swiped over his lip, as if tasting her mark. \u201cThen tell me what the fuck is really happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have! Rafe is coming after you. He\u2019s coming after me. He won\u2019t stop until we\u2019re both dead.\u201d The hard length of his aroused flesh pressed against her sex, and Sarah couldn\u2019t control the small arch she made against him.</p><p>His gaze searched hers, probably saw too much. Then he nodded, the move quick and grim.</p><p>Oh, great, now what\u2014</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll just have to make sure we kill him first,\u201d Lucas said, and then he gave her what she\u2019d wanted\u2014he pressed his mouth to hers. A hard, hot kiss.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that a woman had set him up to die. Pretty women were used as bait by all sorts of paranormals and even by humans.</p><p>So maybe Sarah was screwing him over. Maybe he\u2019d be a fool to trust her, but right then, one thing was clear to Lucas.</p><p>He fucking wanted her.</p><p>Her scent filled his head. Drove him crazy. She was all curves and silken flesh beneath him. Her hands were on him, holding tight to his shoulders as she urged him closer.</p><p>Sarah wasn\u2019t shoving him away because she was afraid of the beast he carried. She knew just how deadly he could be, and the woman still wanted him.</p><p>He could smell her arousal in the air.</p><p>She twisted beneath him, her hips pushing against his aroused flesh.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Was this the kind of response she\u2019d given to that bastard Rafe? His hands flew away from her. He grabbed the bedcovers, and his claws sliced right through the fabric.</p><p>But he kept kissing her because he couldn\u2019t let her mouth go. The woman\u2019s taste was addictive.</p><p>She moaned low in her throat and the sound vibrated in his mouth. Her breasts stabbed at his chest, the nipples tight and tempting.</p><p>Sarah turned her head, tearing her lips from his. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t . . . want you.\u201d The words were gasped out.</p><p>And they really pissed him off. \u201cBecause of what I am?\u201d Maybe it was there, after all. Hiding beneath her surface. Fuck a monster, but fear him.</p><p>But she shook her head, sending those thick locks of hair sliding back over her cheeks. \u201cBecause this isn\u2019t me.\u201d Whispered now. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t respond this way normally.\u201d</p><p>Were her cheeks red? Her heartbeat drummed so fast it shook her chest. He stared down at her, claws still in the bed, and wondered what the hell he was supposed to do with her.</p><p>Take her.</p><p>Protect her.</p><p>Both were instincts from the beast. The same instincts he\u2019d had from the beginning. Those instincts made him nervous. Humans were supposed to be prey to him. Easy pickings. He wasn\u2019t supposed to care what happened to them.</p><p>But he cared about her.</p><p>Protect her.</p><p>Even from himself?</p><p>Lucas sucked in a deep breath. He caught her scent\u2014wanted more. Not now. Can\u2019t. Time was running out.</p><p>He shoved away from her and managed to rise to his feet. Her breath came too fast, making her chest heave as she stared up at him. \u201cI told you we\u2019d have sex,\u201d he said because they needed to be clear about this.</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cAnd I told you sex wasn\u2019t part of our deal.\u201d Her lips were red, swollen from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d His cock was so heavy and hard that the damn thing ached. For her. \u201cBut you want me, I want you, and even the monsters at the gate aren\u2019t going to stop me from taking you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLust is fleeting.\u201d Her gaze seemed to look far away. Not even seeing him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a need, just a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Her gaze sharpened on him. Good. He spoke deliberately, wanting her to know what would come. \u201cI don\u2019t know what sex was like for you before, but I can tell you this . . . it won\u2019t be fleeting with me. The need will be so strong it will feel like it\u2019s ripping you apart, and when you think you can\u2019t stand it anymore . . . that\u2019s when the pleasure will come, and it\u2019ll make your whole body burn.\u201d</p><p>The rasp of her breath seemed loud in the room. Or, shit, maybe that was his breath. What was she doing to him?</p><p>Take her. The beast was growling in his head again. But Sarah rose from the bed. She crossed her arms over her chest, staring at him a bit nervously. Did she think he was about to pounce? Again? Tempting.</p><p>\u201cNext time, you come to me,\u201d he said. \u201cCome to me, and I\u2019ll give you all the pleasure you can handle. And it won\u2019t have a damn thing to do with our deal.\u201d The attraction between them was a bonus, or maybe a deadly temptation. He really wasn\u2019t sure which yet. Time would tell.</p><p>He turned away from her and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sleep with every wolf I meet.\u201d</p><p>That froze him. He looked back at her, aware that his jaw had tightened. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only been with one wolf. Just Rafe.\u201d</p><p>And me, babe. You\u2019ll be with me, but we\u2019ll get to that soon enough.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t end so well,\u201d she murmured and he saw her blink quickly. Wait\u2014was she blinking back tears? Tears?</p><p>His gut clenched.</p><p>But she spun toward the window, her shoulders straight and tense. \u201cWhat kind of deal did you work out with the coyotes?\u201d</p><p>Not the question he\u2019d expected right then. Lucas didn\u2019t answer because, really, there wasn\u2019t an easy way to put this.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d She waited a moment, then, when he didn\u2019t answer, she turned back to him. No tears were in her eyes. Just determination. \u201cI know they didn\u2019t just bow their heads and leave. They knew I was here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what deal did you make with them? How did you get them to walk away?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled on a hard sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re worth a lot of money, lady.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lips curled in a humorless smile. \u201cToo much for them to walk away.\u201d</p><p>True. So why lie? \u201cWe reached a deal.\u201d How would she take this?</p><p>A faint line appeared between her brows. \u201cWhat did you promise?\u201d</p> <p>Not much, just . . . \u201cTo kill you.\u201d</p><p>The scent of death surrounded her. Sarah stood in the medical examiner\u2019s office, eyeing the closed metal lockers. Bodies were in there. A body was on the table next to her, the toe tagged and a sheet tossed over the victim\u2019s face and chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be here,\u201d she managed quietly, but what she really wanted to say was This is stupid! The cops are close! We need to get the hell out of here!</p><p>But after telling her that he was planning to kill her\u2014um, what?\u2014Lucas had pulled her down the stairs, shoved her into an SUV, and driven her back to the city. One of his shifters had been waiting for them at the door. Michael, the tall, dark shifter who seemed to follow Lucas\u2019s orders so very well.</p><p>\u201cNo one will be back here for another hour.\u201d Michael went to the metal locker on the right and jerked it open. Cold air wafted to them, and he yanked out a slab. \u201cKelly gave me the schedule and the key\u2014we\u2019re clear.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas stalked to that slab and the dead body on it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s John, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sarah forced herself to speak and was rather impressed by the even tone of her voice. Sure, her nails were digging so hard into her palms that she was pretty sure she\u2019d draw blood soon, but she sounded normal.</p><p>Michael grunted and pulled back the sheet.</p><p>Sarah stumbled and her elbow slammed into an instrument tray. Scalpels and tweezers and she didn\u2019t even want to know what else clattered to the floor.</p><p>\u201cFirst dead body?\u201d Michael drawled.</p><p>No. About the twentieth. Was she supposed to get numb to them? \u201cA dead friend,\u201d she snapped back and whirled away from him. She hadn\u2019t realized the attack had been so . . . brutal. John\u2019s throat had been ripped wide open. No, not ripped. Clawed.</p> <p>And Michael was going to mock her? Asshole. How would he react if he were looking at one of his shifter buddies? Oh, wait, if he was anything like the coyotes, he\u2019d be the one doing the killing, so he probably wouldn\u2019t give a shit if a packmate died.</p><p>Her shoe kicked against the scalpel. She bent and began picking up the surgical instruments. She crouched low, and slid the scalpel up her sleeve, securing it with the band of her watch.</p><p>\u201cSarah?\u201d Lucas\u2019s quiet whisper.</p><p>She rose quickly, and dumped the other items back on the tray.</p><p>His fingers wrapped around her shoulder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d She faced him. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing my friend sliced open, okay? It\u2019s not one of the highlights of my night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile the coyotes are in the city, you go where I go.\u201d His lips tightened. \u201cAnd I need to check this body, so I know it sucks, but you have to stay here.\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head in a brief nod. She understood all this, it just didn\u2019t mean she had to like the situation. And that thick smell of disinfectant was making her sick.</p> <p>He caught her chin and tipped her head back. \u201cYou hurt for him and you\u2019re furious that this happened to him. Right now, there\u2019s no time for the hurt. Just focus on the fury, and it\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d His hand fell away.</p><p>She blinked. Focus on the fury. Interesting. It almost seemed like the wolf cared how she felt. No, don\u2019t fall into that trap. He sees you as a tool he can use, just like Rafe.</p><p>\u201cClaws ripped his throat open, no doubt.\u201d Michael\u2019s voice. Her gaze shot to the left. He was leaning over John\u2019s body, his eyes slitting as he studied the wounds on John\u2019s neck. \u201cNo knife did this.\u201d He glanced at Lucas, nodding. \u201cDefinitely shifter.\u201d</p><p>Lucas stepped closer to the body. \u201cWolf or coyote?\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s breath froze in her throat. She couldn\u2019t help it, she had to look at John\u2019s face. Still handsome in death with his strong nose, high cheekbones, and that stubborn jaw. But his blue eyes were closed, no longer snapping out energy. The bronzed skin was too pale.</p><p>I\u2019ll meet you in LA. Simone is the one we need. We can end this thing. He just has to help us. Then the road ahead is free.</p><p>She brushed past Lucas. Ran her hand over the too-icy flesh of John\u2019s cheek. This wasn\u2019t the kind of freedom he\u2019d been talking about.</p><p>\u201cI smell coyote all over the poor bastard,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Lucas agreed. \u201cBut the guy was a charmer, he worked with the coyotes.\u201d</p><p>So their smell would be on him.</p><p>Sarah felt the stare on her and she looked to the left, meeting Michael\u2019s assessing brown gaze. \u201cHe worked with them . . . like she worked with the wolves.\u201d Not a question from the dark wolf.</p><p>But, yeah, they\u2019d both been spies of a sort.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, John. If she\u2019d gotten to LA sooner, would she have been able to stop this?</p><p>Michael pulled back the sheet and studied John\u2019s arms. \u201cNo defensive wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he didn\u2019t have time to fight,\u201d Lucas said and she knew he was right. \u201cProbably never saw the guy coming.\u201d</p><p>No, because if he had, John would\u2019ve fought.</p><p>She pulled her hand away from John. Her fingers balled into a fist. She could still feel the cold touch of his flesh. \u201cIf it was fast, then he didn\u2019t suffer much.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t that have been comforting? Why wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Michael exhaled. \u201cThere\u2019s no wolf scent on this guy, and those marks on his neck . . .\u201d He scratched his chin. \u201cNot quite as big as a wolf\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>Coyote.</p><p>\u201cThen we know what got him.\u201d Lucas yanked the sheet back over John\u2019s body. \u201cClose him up, Michael.\u201d He caught Sarah\u2019s arm. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Finally. This time, she was the one to pull him along as she hurried outside. She wanted air. Her cheeks felt too chilled, almost as cold as John\u2019s. Her feet thudded down the hallway. The tiles gleamed up at her and the fluorescent lights dimmed a bit overhead.</p><p>Her left hand slammed against the exit door. She sucked in a deep breath of fresh air. Not death. She tried to rush forward\u2014</p><p>But Lucas\u2019s hold stopped her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>He yanked her back, pulling her into the shadows and caging her body between his and the hard brick building. He still had her right hand, his fingers holding it tightly. \u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNotice what?\u201d</p><p>He shoved back her sleeve and the scalpel glinted.</p><p>The wolf saw too much. She\u2019d remember that. Now she just snapped, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t taken my knife, I wouldn\u2019t have needed a backup weapon.\u201d</p><p>He slipped the scalpel free and tossed it on the ground.</p><p>Great. \u201cYou told me you were going to kill me,\u201d she reminded him. Don\u2019t think about John. Not yet, don\u2019t. \u201cSo, yes, I took the chance to grab a weapon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what I said?\u201d His thumb brushed over her wrist. Her pulse pounded quickly beneath that light touch. And since when was the alpha wolf given to light touches?</p><p>\u201cY-yes . . .\u201d The heat from his body was slowly banishing the cold. \u201cYou made a deal with the coyotes. You said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think I haven\u2019t lied to them before?\u201d He smiled at her then, flashing those sharp teeth. \u201cYou and I already have a deal, don\u2019t we? And it\u2019s a deal that doesn\u2019t involve your death.\u201d</p><p>But if he\u2019d lied to the coyotes, how did she know he wasn\u2019t lying to her? Especially since I\u2019m lying to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to trust me for this to work,\u201d he told her and his breath feathered over her cheek.</p><p>\u201cTrust isn\u2019t exactly easy for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a choice now?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you to satisfy those bastards.\u201d Flat. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not turning you over to them.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>There was no one else she could trust. If he turned on her, she was dead. But if he wanted me dead, I would have been dead last night. A shifter is always armed. One slice of his claws, and I would have been on a slab next to John.</p><p>\u201cNow what thought just ran through your mind?\u201d He asked, his lips coming close to hers. \u201cWhat made fear flash in your eyes?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath and tasted him. \u201cI want my knife back.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what caused the fear.\u201d</p><p>He was very good at reading her. \u201cYou want me to trust you. I want you to trust me.\u201d She licked her lips and watched the dip of his gaze as he followed the movement. \u201cYou don\u2019t attack me, I don\u2019t attack you, but I want that knife. I\u2019m not going to be defenseless.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t, not really, but he didn\u2019t know that. A woman had to keep some secrets in this world.</p><p>His lips pressed against hers and he stole her breath. Then his tongue slipped into her mouth, bringing his wild taste, and Sarah\u2019s heart raced even faster.</p><p>The door squeaked open. \u201cLucas?\u201d</p><p>He raised his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not defenseless.\u201d Then he eased away and called, \u201cWe\u2019re here, Michael.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to the scalpel. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to pick it up . . .</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a coyote hit,\u201d Lucas said, \u201cbut I want to see the house again. There was no time yesterday. As soon as I got out of the car, the cops swarmed me.\u201d</p><p>Ahem. Ah, yes, that had actually been her fault. Should she mention that part of the story now?</p><p>\u201cYour house is still a crime scene, man.\u201d Worry hardened Michael\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s taped off and the cops are probably patrolling the area.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed softly. \u201cLike a few human cops are going to stop me.\u201d</p><p>Like anything would stop him.</p><p>Dane had to keep his distance from the coyotes. If he came within a mile of them, they\u2019d catch his scent. So he pulled his motorcycle to the curb, hid in the shadows, and used his night-vision binoculars to watch the bastards.</p><p>He counted ten of them. The youngest was a kid, barely looked eighteen. The oldest seemed to be skating close to forty. Two women were in the group\u2014but he couldn\u2019t tell if they were coyote shifters or humans.</p><p>Their base was a ranch-style house, one that was fairly secluded in a patch of woods. Nothing fancy, because the coyotes wouldn\u2019t have wanted to draw attention to themselves. It wasn\u2019t as easy to kill when attention was on you.</p><p>After a few moments, all of the coyotes went in the house. He lowered the binoculars and pulled out his phone. Three seconds later, he had Lucas on the line. \u201c2408 Wyler Road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny signs of Rafe?\u201d</p><p>Lucas had briefed them all on Sarah\u2019s story, and Dane knew Rafael Santiago. Their paths had crossed once in Chicago. \u201cNo. No signs . . .\u201d He inhaled, caught only the scent of coyote, \u201cof any other shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes on \u2019em. If you see any sign of a wolf . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll report right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that. And watch your back.\u201d</p><p>He always did. Dane tucked the phone into his pocket. It was going to be one damn long night. But maybe the coyotes would oblige him and produce the wolves\u2014then he could have some ass-kicking fun with his pack.</p><p>A twig snapped behind him. Dane didn\u2019t glance back. He kept his gaze on the house. Ass-kicking fun. Looked like he\u2019d get that good time sooner than he\u2019d thought. His claws pushed through the tops of his fingertips. The wild scent of shifter filled his nose.</p><p>So did the lush scent of woman.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not my style to attack from behind.\u201d Her voice floated to him. Soft, sexy.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>He spun around. She smiled at him, a flash of white teeth and sexy red lips. Small, curved, and tempting, the pretty redhead stood just in front of a line of thick trees. The moon shone down on her, illuminating her pale skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my style,\u201d she said again, and her gaze darted just over Dane\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBut it is his.\u201d</p><p>And a freight train slammed into him.</p><p>To appease Michael, Lucas waited until the patrol car\u2019s tail-lights disappeared around the corner, then he jumped out of the SUV and headed for his house. Sarah moved just as quickly, hurrying out and sticking to the shadows as she headed for the house on Bryton Road.</p><p>The scents of the night hit him. Gasoline. Alcohol. Stale cigarettes. And blood. Lots of blood.</p><p>He slipped under the yellow police tape and stalked toward the porch steps. With his enhanced vision, he could still see the giant bloodstain that marred the wood. The poor bastard had bled out fast.</p><p>Guess that was a good thing.</p><p>Some prey deserved to suffer, some didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not scenting wolf,\u201d Michael muttered from behind them. \u201cLeast not any wolves that don\u2019t belong here.\u201d</p><p>\u2019Cause he let some of his pack visit\u2014very rarely, but sometimes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe . . . maybe the attacker blocked his scent,\u201d Sarah said quietly, near the porch but with her face carefully averted from the steps. \u201cIt is possible, you know.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew. He\u2019d blocked his scent with herbs a few times when he didn\u2019t want the coyotes to know that he was hunting. But . . .</p><p>He closed his eyes and inhaled deeper. So many scents. Some old, some faint. Others fresher, stronger.</p><p>Sweeter.</p><p>His eyes opened and, very slowly, Lucas turned his head to stare at Sarah. She\u2019d wrapped her arms around her body, as if to keep warm. But it wasn\u2019t a cold night. Far from it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLooks like the crime-scene guys from the LAPD did a good sweep of this place,\u201d Michael said, not seeming to pay them any attention. \u201cCan\u2019t even find cigarette butts on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn didn\u2019t smoke,\u201d she said at once.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cSomeone did. I can still smell the ash.\u201d But the evidence had been removed.</p> <p>Because he was watching her so closely, Lucas saw her flinch. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cTime to pay a visit to Marley,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Michael spun around. \u201cAw, hell, you still got that demon playing watchdog for you?\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s brows pulled low. \u201cMarley?\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d No sense going inside. The dead guy had never made it past the porch.</p> <p>They\u2019d parked the SUV down the deserted street, but he didn\u2019t head back to it. Instead, he cut through the thin line of trees and snaked to the left, toward the old, rundown house that bordered his strip of property. That place was his, too, though no one would ever be able to find a record that said so.</p><p>He\u2019d bought both places because he liked his privacy and they were the only two houses on the street. Yeah, he liked privacy, but he also liked protection. That was where Marley came in.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother knocking when he bounded onto the sagging porch, he just kicked the door in.</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d Sarah\u2019s horrified whisper.</p><p>An old woman spun to face him, her hair stark white and her face etched with deep lines. She shuffled toward them, her steps small and mincing. \u201cWhat do you\u2014why are you here?\u201d Beady eyes swept the group.</p><p>He growled. \u201cCut the damn act, Marley.\u201d</p> <p>The old woman vanished in an instant. Demons and their glamour. Those skilled at cloaking magic could project any image they wanted to the world. Marley transformed in front of them, the white hair darkening to black, the deep wrinkles slipping away until smooth skin remained. Another mask? Probably, but it was the one Marley liked to use the most.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d She asked again, glaring. \u201cYou said I\u2019d be left alone, Lucas. I did my part. I burned those bastards to ash, but you said I\u2019d be left alone.\u201d</p><p>Ah, another deal. A demon who\u2019d been desperate to slip away from the world and a wolf who\u2019d needed vengeance. Their agreement had been fairly satisfactory.</p><p>\u201cThere a particular reason you let those assholes haul me away, huh, Marley?\u201d He stepped closer and the demon didn\u2019t back up. Surprising. For a while, Marley had backed up when anyone came close. That\u2019s why she\u2019d wanted to hide in the woods. To stay far away from everyone and everything.</p><p>Since he\u2019d needed a guard on his house who didn\u2019t smell of wolf, he\u2019d humored her. Humor time was over.</p><p>Her lips lifted in a taunting half-smile. \u201cI knew the cops wouldn\u2019t keep you for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the attack.\u201d Not a question. He heard footsteps behind him as Michael and Sarah came inside the cabin.</p><p>Marley\u2019s blue gaze\u2014another lie, a demon\u2019s real eyes were black\u2014lowered a bit, then flickered to Michael. \u201cI . . . I didn\u2019t see the kill.\u201d Quiet. \u201cBy the time I caught the scent of blood on the wind . . .\u201d</p> <p>A demon\u2019s sense of smell was nowhere near as powerful as a shifter\u2019s.</p><p>\u201c. . . it was too late. The human was dead.\u201d</p><p>Great. \u201cI let you stay here because you said you\u2019d guard the house.\u201d His one retreat. The place away from the pack. Now the place was stained with blood. Hell, wasn\u2019t everything he touched stained with blood?</p><p>\u201cI have been guarding it, okay? I went out\u2014I do that sometimes, you know. If you want full-time surveillance, get a freaking video camera.\u201d</p><p>Right. Because he wanted footage of himself shifting into a wolf. That would be great when it fell into the wrong hands and got blasted all over fucking kingdom-come.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see the kill.\u201d Marley tossed back her hair and lifted her hand. Her finger pointed straight at Sarah. \u201cBut I did see her.\u201d</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t gasp in shock. Didn\u2019t start yelling that the demon was lying. He glanced at her from the corner of his eye. Her face appeared totally blank.</p><p>\u201cSomething you need to tell me, Sarah?\u201d he asked softly but Marley\u2019s words weren\u2019t a surprise. Just confirmation. He\u2019d caught Sarah\u2019s scent near the porch. Fainter, but still sweet vanilla.</p><p>Her gaze tracked to his. \u201cI was supposed to be with John. We were supposed to meet at your place\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you even know about his place?\u201d Michael interrupted, his voice rough as the wolf began to near the surface. \u201cYou and the dead human shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe knew about the place, so that meant I knew.\u201d</p><p>He was getting real sick of old Rafe.</p><p>Sarah held Lucas\u2019s stare. \u201cI was late. I should have been here sooner, but I was late.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been late, would he have come back and found her dead body on his doorstep, too? And would he even have cared?</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t have known her. Wouldn\u2019t have kissed her.</p><p>A dead human.</p><p>Would he have cared?</p><p>His claws broke through his fingertips. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u201d Can\u2019t trust her. He knew that. The woman wore secrets like other women wore perfume.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the point? When I got here, he was already dead.\u201d She stared down at her hands. She turned them over, staring at the palms. Lucas thought of the pool of blood that had surrounded the body.</p><p>Did it stain your hands, Sarah?</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t there,\u201d she told him. \u201cNo one was there. So I ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the cops came,\u201d Marley muttered, watching Sarah closely, \u201cright after your girl vanished.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cSo I had to vanish for a time, too. Until those jerks stopped searching the property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you gave me an alibi.\u201d Lucas cocked his head as his gaze slid back to Sarah. She was still staring at her hands. Still seeing blood? \u201cYou\u2019re the reason the cops tossed my ass in jail.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hands, and her gaze lifted to his. \u201cNo. You got tossed in jail because you\u2019ve got a history with the cops. It\u2019s not my fault you and that detective\u2014detective\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce Langston.\u201d Dickhead.</p><p>\u201c\u2014have some kind of war going on.\u201d She straightened her shoulders. \u201cI wasn\u2019t just going to leave John\u2019s body out here to rot. He deserved better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost folks don\u2019t deserve the way they die.\u201d</p><p>Michael crowded in close to her. \u201cAnd some folks do.\u201d His eyes had narrowed with suspicion. \u201cSome folks deserve exactly what they get.\u201d</p><p>Her small jaw clenched. \u201cBack off, wolf,\u201d she gritted.</p><p>Lucas slanted a hard glance at Michael.</p><p>The wolf eased back a step, but he glared at Lucas. \u201cDon\u2019t let your dick lead you, man. The woman lied to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never asked me if I was here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? You never said!\u201d Michael snarled right back.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s gaze darted back to Marley. She was watching Michael and Sarah, a faint gleam in her eyes.</p><p>Marley. The bloody and beaten demon who\u2019d come to him six months ago. She\u2019d begged for his pack\u2019s aid, saying she only wanted a safe place to stay, and in return, she\u2019d given them her fire. Demons were so good at controlling fire.</p><p>And there had been some murdering assholes who deserved those flames.</p><p>As far as Lucas knew, Marley had never left the house since they\u2019d made their agreement. Food and supplies were brought to her. So after six months, suddenly, she decided to take a stroll . . .</p><p>He moved quickly, catching both of her arms and pinning them behind her back.</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d Her scream of shock.</p><p>Sarah and Michael both froze.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you go, Marley?\u201d</p><p>She twisted against him. \u201cLet me go!\u201d Fire began to lick across the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>The fire flared higher\u2014then it shot straight for Sarah. \u201cGet her out of here!\u201d Lucas ordered because no way was he letting the demon go then.</p><p>Michael grabbed Sarah\u2019s arm and hauled her toward the door. They\u2019d taken about three steps when the door slammed closed, trapping them inside. Damn demon power.</p><p>Lucas brought his hand to Marley\u2019s throat. \u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d he whispered and he let her feel the sting of his claws on her flesh. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t go any damn place. I know you\u2019re lying. So who the hell did you see slice that human?\u201d</p><p>The flames circled Sarah and Michael. The fire burned higher.</p><p>His claws pressed deeper. \u201cIf the flames don\u2019t die, you do.\u201d His gaze darted to Sarah.</p><p>Her eyes met his through the flames. He knew she\u2019d see the beast shining in his stare. See the claws, see the teeth. Here\u2019s the monster, never really hidden by the man.</p><p>The fire was so close to her skin. Charmers were weak when it came to magic. The fire would hurt her, kill her\u2014</p><p>A growl worked in his throat as he turned his fury back on Marley. If this was the way it would end . . .</p><p>The flames died. Smoke drifted in the air. \u201cJess . . .\u201d The name was a sigh that broke from Marley\u2019s lips. \u201cHe and the coyotes . . . they killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d he whispered in her ear, not wanting Sarah to hear. \u201cYou just stood back and fucking watched?\u201d</p><p>A tremble shook her. \u201cIt was watch or die myself.\u201d</p><p>He knew Sarah heard the words because her eyes widened. \u201cThey were going to wait for her,\u201d Marley said, and Lucas kept his claws near her throat. \u201cBut it took too long. You were due back . . .\u201d She swallowed, and he felt the gulp against his hand.</p><p>He dropped his hold but didn\u2019t step back. \u201cWas it all a setup?\u201d Fuck, how long had this plan been in motion? \u201cThey sent you in . . . just to set me up?\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted as blood dripped down her throat. \u201cI\u2019m a low-level demon. Barely a three on the power scale. All I can do is use the glamour. Cloak. Hide.\u201d Her brittle laugh filled the air. \u201cI might as well be human. A freaking rag doll for the paranormals out there.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d looked like a rag doll the first time he\u2019d seen her. A broken, bloody doll that had been thrown away. \u201cThey beat you, then they sent you to me?\u201d</p><p>He caught the sad whisper of Sarah\u2019s gasp.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Marley\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want their scents on me.\u201d Her gaze darted to Michael. \u201cThey had the demons beat me, then they sent me to you.\u201d</p><p>He knew she hadn\u2019t lied about her attack when she\u2019d first come to him. And he\u2019d wanted her fire. Seemed like a fair exchange at the time.</p><p>His eyes collided with Sarah\u2019s. Was any deal really fair these days?</p><p>\u201cWhy did you help them?\u201d Because Marley had helped. Not just watched. Helped. Dammit. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they would have killed me if I didn\u2019t!\u201d Marley\u2019s words came out, fast, tumbling. \u201cAnd all I did was let them know when the charmer came. That\u2019s all they wanted. I haven\u2019t told them anything else, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Because there\u2019d been nothing else to tell. He\u2019d never let Marley in on pack secrets.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then, \u201cJohn was a good man,\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice drifted through the cabin. \u201cDid you care about that at all? Did it matter to you who died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Marley\u2019s voice was much softer. \u201cDidn\u2019t matter at all . . . as long as I was the one who got to keep breathing.\u201d</p><p>She would have stood back and watched Sarah die, too.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell them we were here tonight?\u201d Lucas asked but he already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cS-sorry . . .\u201d She whispered and her head fell forward, the long locks of her hair dropped to cover her face. \u201cAnd they know it\u2019s just you and Michael. That you don\u2019t have the full strength of your pack.\u201d A weak, bitter laugh. \u201cOr even the strength of your four horsemen.\u201d</p><p>Caleb. Dane. Piers. Michael. His own apocalypse that sent death to his enemies.</p><p>Her shoulders dipped. \u201cTh-they\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><p>To kill you. To take the girl.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d from Michael.</p><p>\u201cI would have protected you,\u201d Lucas said quietly as rage pumped through him. The change was coming. There would be no way to hold back the shift. The beast\u2019s rage was too strong.</p><p>Her head whipped up, and she stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019ll have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled away. \u201cLucas\u2014\u201d</p><p>A howl split the night. Not the harder, longer cry of a wolf. Shorter, higher. A coyote. But that howl was immediately followed by another. Another, another.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He spun around. A trap. One he\u2019d walked right into. He yanked out his cell. Piers answered on the second ring. \u201cGet to Bryton Road. The dogs are out.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t going to wait for backup to arrive. That was time they didn\u2019t have to waste.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Sarah was at the window, peeking through the old blinds. \u201cI can hear them, but I can\u2019t see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all around us.\u201d Michael stood right behind her, his body a long, lethal shadow. His gaze shot to Lucas. \u201cI see at least ten.\u201d</p><p>Freaking coyotes.</p><p>The floorboard squeaked behind them. \u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d he asked Marley quietly. It was a shame. Marley had always been weak, not just in terms of power scale, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cThey know your weakness, wolf.\u201d Marley\u2019s words came out with more heat than he\u2019d expected from her. \u201cWhy do you think they sent me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced back at her. At the tilt of his head, Michael closed in on her. Sarah followed him.</p><p>Marley\u2019s gaze jumped to Sarah. \u201cThey understand how to get beneath your skin. Know what makes you weak. Before you even realize it, you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sarah lunged forward and drove her fist right into the demon\u2019s face. Marley went down, and she didn\u2019t get up.</p> <p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Sarah shook her hand, and flexed her fingers. \u201cThat hurt!\u201d</p><p>Probably hurt Marley more.</p><p>\u201cI was scared she\u2019d start another fire,\u201d Sarah told him, turning her eyes to his. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough trouble without\u2014\u201d</p><p>More howls. So close. Those dogs would be on them soon.</p><p>\u201cNot the worst odds we\u2019ve ever faced,\u201d Michael said, even as his bones began to snap and pop. He dropped to the floor, bracing his hands as his body stretched and his clothes ripped along his body.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lucas watched him and let the fire burst through his skin. The shift was always red-hot, burning him from the inside out as the beast broke free.</p><p>He spared one last glance for Sarah. Her eyes were so wide as she stared at him. Normally, this would be the part where he told her not to be scared. No point in that, though. The woman knew wolves, and as for being scared . . .</p><p>Claws hit the outside of the door. Hmmm . . . Good thing Marley had used her power to slam it closed and seal the place. The locked door would buy them a little more time.</p><p>\u201cHide,\u201d he managed to snarl the word to Sarah as he fell to the floor. His claws scraped over the wood.</p><p>\u201cLucas . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess . . . you\u2019re getting . . .\u201d His spine arched. Fur broke through his skin. \u201cIn . . . my . . . mind . . .\u201d Then a howl burst from his mouth as the beast took over.</p> <p>\u201cGuess I am,\u201d her soft whisper seemed too loud in his ears, and when the wolf stared at her, there wasn\u2019t just fear in her eyes. There was sadness.</p><p>Then she turned and ran, jumping over Marley\u2019s body. And he met the dogs at the door.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>No, no, no. This wasn\u2019t the way things should have happened. Sarah froze at the sound of Lucas\u2019s growl. No way could he and Michael take down that coyote pack out there. He wasn\u2019t strong enough for that. Two against ten? Even he wasn\u2019t that good.</p><p>She glanced over at the demon. Marley was still dead to the world, and the demon\u2019s body was about to be slam in the middle of carnage central. Sarah raced forward and grabbed Marley\u2019s wrist, then she hauled the demon back, not really caring too much when the chick\u2019s head bumped over the floor. She was helping, right?</p><p>Growls and howls echoed through the cabin. She could hear the scrape of claws. Those bastards were planning to claw their way inside. Then what? They\u2019d rip Michael and Lucas apart?</p><p>She pulled Marley\u2019s body behind the couch and let the demon\u2019s arm fall.</p><p>Stay down. Sarah stiffened at that hard demand. A demand that hadn\u2019t been voiced. Lucas. She could finally touch his thoughts now. She closed her eyes a moment and felt that light trail that led back to his mind. Every beast she charmed had a special psychic trail. A trail that she could follow.</p> <p>Lucas\u2019s trail wasn\u2019t as bright as others. No, his was dark and twisting. Maybe because the man inside the beast was dark. Twisted? Perhaps. But maybe not.</p><p>I\u2019ve got the bastards that come in through the door. Lucas again. But the words were directed at Michael this time. Shifters could communicate telepathically when they were in animal form. A nice little bonus from Mother Nature that made hunting in packs so much easier, and so much more deadly.</p><p>Sarah crouched behind the couch and shook the demon. She hadn\u2019t punched that hard. Well, maybe she had. Though she\u2019d faked the hand pain after the punch. She knew how to hit hard without bringing pain.</p><p>Stay with Sarah. Lucas\u2019s order to Michael. If anyone comes at her, you rip the bastard\u2019s throat open.</p><p>Her breath caught at that order. Then a big, black wolf was there. Standing right beside her. Protecting her. But who was protecting Lucas? Hell, no, Michael. Just haul your ass right back over there. If he falls, I\u2019m dead anyway.</p><p>The black wolf glanced back at her.</p><p>He stays. Lucas\u2019s snapped command.</p><p>Dammit! She poked her head over the couch and got her first clear look at Lucas in wolf form. Unfortunately, that was the same instant that the coyotes burst through the door.</p><p>Lucas\u2014a muscled, snarling, teeth snapping mass of black fur\u2014leapt into the air. He caught the neck of the first coyote with his teeth, and, using that hold, he threw the coyote through the air. He swiped the second beast with his claws, cutting him open and the blood sprayed Lucas\u2019s fur.</p><p>Kill.</p><p>Not her thought.</p><p>Glass shattered as more coyotes flew through the windows. Two more coyotes attacked Lucas. Snarling, biting.</p><p>Kill. Lucas\u2019s only thought. No, wait, he was also\u2014</p><p>Protect.</p><p>She dug her fingers into Michael\u2019s fur. His giant body was trembling with the effort of holding back. He wanted into that fray, but he wasn\u2019t about to disobey his alpha.</p><p>A coyote\u2019s body hit the floor. Blood matted his fur. Another coyote launched onto Lucas\u2019s back, sinking his teeth into muscle and bone. Lucas rolled over, slamming the coyote into the floor.</p><p>Kill.</p><p>A howl echoed in the distance, but this howl was deeper than the others. Harder. Darker. Familiar.</p><p>Rafe.</p><p>The swarm of smaller coyote bodies had almost hidden Lucas now. The coyotes weren\u2019t even trying to come for her, they just wanted to take Lucas out. That had been the plan, right?</p><p>Her fingers were still in Michael\u2019s fur. She crouched back behind the couch. Your alpha needs you. They don\u2019t want me, they\u2019re going to kill him. While she hid and watched.</p><p>You don\u2019t know my alpha. Michael\u2019s voice floated in her mind. He\u2019s stronger, he\u2019s\u2014</p><p>More snarls and growls. More freaking coyotes. Help him. She lunged to her feet even as Michael leapt forward.</p><p>\u201cHey, bastards! How does it feel to be nothing more than freaking pit bulls for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Blood. Teeth. Fury. Not from the coyotes. Their bodies littered the floor. From Lucas. The wolf stood poised inside the doorway, blood dripping from his teeth, those blue eyes so bright they hurt to look at.</p><p>Oh, damn. He\u2019d taken them all out.</p><p>Here\u2019s your chance. Run. Get to the car and drive back to base.</p><p>Because another attack would be coming.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re after you tonight, not me,\u201d Sarah said. Michael was sniffing around the coyotes, making sure they didn\u2019t rise. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019ll rip you apart.</p><p>Great. Nice visual. Sadly, a true visual. Not like she could fight the coyotes. \u201cLet\u2019s all get the hell out of here.\u201d Before they all died. She knew the wolf waiting out there, he wouldn\u2019t be alone. He never was, he\u2014</p><p>The wail of sirens echoed in the night. Sirens? Oh, crap, yes, the cops had been watching the house. The coyotes would still be in human form when they first arrived. Dozens of men, swarming on a closed crime scene\u2014of course any cop in the area would have called for backup.</p><p>Those sirens were getting close now. So close.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t hear anymore howls. No more snarls.</p><p>Some of the coyotes, the dead, had already shifted back to human form. The others were hauling ass out of that cabin.</p><p>Run, Lucas. Get out. The cops can\u2019t find you here.</p><p>His head tilted. She knew he heard the raised voices of the cops. She knew because she was in his head and could pick up his every thought.</p><p>His gaze bored into her. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she promised. Such a lie.</p><p>And he knew it.</p><p>But what choice was there? Was he really going to face the LAPD in full-on wolf form? Especially when that detective was already gunning for him? A blood-soaked wolf. Right. The cops would shoot instantly when they saw him.</p><p>She could already hear the thunder of gunfire. Were the cops firing at the coyotes?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to run, Lucas. I\u2019ll need someone to bail my ass out of jail.\u201d Because that\u2019s where she was heading.</p><p>His blue eyes burned. Tell them nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou can count on that.\u201d Like they\u2019d believe her anyway. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>He whirled away, a dangerous shadow, and he dove through the remains of the broken door. Michael followed on his heels, a slightly smaller, but just as dangerous beast.</p><p>Her hands balled into fists even as her gaze darted to the dead men. Men, now, not beasts, and they were men who\u2019d died in a manner that looked too similar to John\u2019s death. Ripped throats. Torn bodies. And, of course, there she stood, right in the middle of the bloodbath.</p><p>\u201cFreeze!\u201d A man\u2019s snarl this time, not a wolf\u2019s, but she hadn\u2019t been moving anyway. Sarah let her stare dart to the doorway. To the two scared-looking cops. Their eyes weren\u2019t on her. They were staring at the bodies. Four bodies. And a hell of a lot of blood.</p><p>Lucas was stronger than she\u2019d realized and so much more dangerous. Was she really up for this game?</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit . . .\u201d One of the uniforms swallowed quickly and it looked like he might be sick.</p><p>Now what was she supposed to say? The older cop, the one who\u2019d gone two shades paler, had his gun pointed right at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t do this,\u201d she finally managed. Yes, that sounded good. \u201cThere\u2019s no blood on me, I don\u2019t have a weapon\u2014I didn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who the hell did?\u201d The older cop barked.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth snapped closed. She wouldn\u2019t trade Lucas\u2019s secrets for her life.</p><p>A groan had her attention shifting to that blood-soaked floor. Marley blinked up at her. \u201cWh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs someone else there?\u201d The cop yelled, and the guy\u2019s partner finally seemed to get control of himself. Now two guns were pointed right at her.</p><p>\u201cLook, officers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCops?\u201d Marley\u2019s whisper. \u201cNo.\u201d She sprang to her feet, and then the fire erupted. A line of flames snaked across the cabin, burning the dead shifters as the fire crackled and spread\u2014and those flames, they headed right for the cops.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch!\u201d</p><p>Bullets blasted. Pain burned across Sarah\u2019s arm. From the fire? From the bullets? The flames raged higher. The demon vanished in the growing smoke, and Sarah was left to face the fire alone.</p><p>The echo of gunfire reverberated in Lucas\u2019s ears even as the scent of smoke burned his nose. He froze in the woods, his head tilting back. His body still had the form of a wolf, but the man inside was all too aware of the dangers around him. Bullets and smoke. His head turned . . .</p><p>The old cabin.</p><p>He lunged forward, but Michael plowed into his side, knocking him back.</p><p>Have to get away. Michael\u2019s desperate thought, one that was reflected in the eyes of the wolf. We left too many dead back there. Can\u2019t let the cops get us.</p><p>Like he fucking cared about the cops. Sarah. She couldn\u2019t handle fire and if one of those idiots so much as scratched her\u2014</p><p>You can\u2019t help her as a wolf. Michael\u2019s fierce reminder.</p><p>No, the wolf couldn\u2019t help her.</p><p>The cops will take her in, Michael continued, panting from the run they\u2019d made. We\u2019ll get her out. We\u2019ll do whatever we have to do, but we\u2019ll get her out.</p><p>He spun away, a howl ripping from his throat as he let the hot pain of the shift sweep through his body.</p><p>He\u2019d promised to protect Sarah, and he damn well planned to keep his part of the deal.</p><p>Dane slowly opened his eyes, aware that something wet was dripping down his face. His nostrils flared\u2014shit, that something wet was blood. That scent was undeniable, and so was the scent of . . . coyote.</p><p>Fuck. He was sitting down, his body slumped in a chair, and his arms were behind his back. He tried lifting his hands, but metal bit into his wrists. Hard, burning metal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s silver,\u201d a soft voice told him.</p><p>His gaze flew to the left. There she was. The pretty little thing who\u2019d screwed his concentration in the woods. A weakness for women\u2014when the hell would he learn?</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d she said, not sounding sorry. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have a lot of choice.\u201d</p><p>His lips stretched in a mirthless grin. \u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t.\u201d He made sure she saw his lengthening fangs.</p><p>\u201cWe needed you.\u201d One shoulder lifted in a shrug that had her red hair sliding back over her shirt. \u201cAt least you\u2019re still alive.\u201d</p><p>Why was he still alive? Coyotes didn\u2019t usually let their prey survive.</p><p>Her gaze tracked to the blood sliding down his face. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you have healed from that?\u201d</p><p>And shouldn\u2019t she know that not all shifters healed at the same rate? \u201cSilver\u2019s slowing me down,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>A fast blink from her. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan? You gonna let the dogs in so they can take turns swiping at me?\u201d Or was she going to save all the torturing fun for herself?</p><p>Now her eyes darted to the window on the left. The only window in the room. He jerked against the cuffs once more. No damn give at all. But . . . he let his claws break through the skin.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not here right now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His brows snapped up, and he felt the faint pull from the torn skin on his forehead. He vaguely remembered slamming into the rocks when the asshole behind him attacked. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really want to know.\u201d</p><p>The claw on his left index finger slipped inside the lock. \u201cWhere?\u201d His voice was loud, the better to cover the scratch of his claws as he worked on the cuffs. The silver burned, but he was used to pain. Pain had been his intimate friend since before he could even shift, and he had the criss-cross of scars on his body to prove it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you think you\u2019re still alive?\u201d she asked instead. Fine, he\u2019d keep her talking. \u201cYou want to use me.\u201d He let his gaze rake her. \u201cCan\u2019t say that I\u2019ll mind you using me.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. What the fuck? Since when did coyote women blush? Sex was as natural to them as breathing\u2014and killing. His nostrils flared again. The scent of coyote was everywhere and it was strongest around the woman.</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t succeed, we\u2019ll trade you.\u201d</p> <p>The claw snagged on the locking mechanism. \u201cFor the charmer?\u201d</p><p>He caught the faint widening of her eyes. \u201cShe told you what she could do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven gave us a little demo.\u201d He kept his smile in place. \u201cSo what does a bunch of dogs want with a little lady who only works with wolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the bounty on her.\u201d</p><p>He whistled just as the lock popped open. \u201cCan\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t tempted to take that myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d turn on your alpha?\u201d No missing the doubt heavy in her voice. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHe should have just turned her over. Now there will be no chance for him.\u201d</p><p>Tension had his body tight. \u201cYour dogs went after Lucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truce is over. They\u2019re going to drag his body back.\u201d</p><p>Pretty face, bitch beneath the surface. \u201cIf you really think they\u2019re strong enough to take him down, then why am I still breathing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTold you . . .\u201d She paced to the window, peered outside, and made the mistake of giving him her back. Bad mistake. \u201cYou\u2019re the backup plan. If Lucas manages to get away, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pounced. He jumped from the chair and had his claws at her throat in less than a second\u2019s time. \u201cThen nothing, sweetheart, because your plan has just changed.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened against him, her smaller body going taut. Her gaze still focused out the window, and, over her shoulder, he saw the trucks spinning into the drive. The dogs were back.</p><p>\u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t,\u201d she told him quietly. \u201cBut it looks like your time has run out.\u201d Then she turned toward him. His claws pressed over her throat. \u201cKill me.\u201d Another shrug. \u201cThey\u2019ll still kill you as soon as they come inside.\u201d</p><p>But he could see the limping, bleeding bodies as the coyotes tumbled out of the trucks. She hadn\u2019t actually looked at the coyotes before she\u2019d spun away. \u201cGuess again.\u201d</p><p>Her delicate nostrils flared and her eyes\u2014so gold and wide\u2014searched his. Then she opened her mouth to scream.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>When Detective Bruce Langston shoved open the door of the small interrogation room, Sarah straightened in the too-hard and wobbly chair.</p> <p>One black brow lifted. \u201cBack so soon, Ms. King?\u201d</p><p>She flattened her hands on the table. \u201cI need to be at a hospital.\u201d She coughed, a hard, heaving cough that was only half-pretend. Damn demon\u2014she\u2019d gotten away in the smoke while Sarah had needed the cops to pull her out of the flames. \u201cI . . . shouldn\u2019t be here . . . I need a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I need a damn wolf in a cage.\u201d</p><p>Her body stiffened.</p><p>He kicked the door closed. \u201cYeah, you heard me.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cI heard you . . . I just don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d He paced around the wooden table, his gaze raking her. \u201cLover-boy blew his hand. I saw his eyes glow. I saw the claws. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t.\u201d Her eyes slanted to the left, to the window that lined the wall. Was someone watching in there? \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not careful, your cop buddies are going to think . . .\u201d another cough, this one completely real, \u201cyou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in front of her and slammed his fists down onto the table. Sarah flinched.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking lie to me!\u201d He snarled, face far too close to hers. \u201cWe both know what Lucas Simone is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even understand what you\u2019re yelling about!\u201d So the cop knew the deal. Maybe he\u2019d known all along. Was he working with the other paranormals in the city? Or, hell, no, could he be working with Rafe? So many cops were on the take . . . she knew that better than others.</p><p>But if he were working with Rafe, she wouldn\u2019t be in interrogation\u2014she\u2019d be in a body bag.</p><p>\u201cHe left you to burn.\u201d Bruce\u2019s hands lifted and his finger traced over the back of her ash stained hand. \u201cYou saved his ass, but he left you.\u201d</p><p>One way of looking at it. She snatched her hand back.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe him anything,\u201d the detective said, voice a little too smooth now. What? Where was all that fiery rage he\u2019d just shown? Was he a one-man good cop/bad cop routine?</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t,\u201d she said, wondering where this was going and also wondering\u2014where the hell was Lucas? Spending the night in a cage didn\u2019t exactly appeal to her.</p><p>Bruce nodded. \u201cGood girl. Think about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ever think about.\u201d</p><p>His gaze searched hers. \u201cI want Simone. He\u2019s an animal, and he needs to be taken down before he kills again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas Simone isn\u2019t a killer.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her.</p><p>\u201cLucas wasn\u2019t anywhere near that house tonight.\u201d She exhaled. \u201cAsk the cops. No one saw him. Because he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Bruce\u2019s fingers closed around her hands in a grip that was almost painful. Walking the line. \u201cOfficer Meadows told me about the bodies, how they\u2019d been slashed, throats ripped, guts torn open.\u201d</p><p>Right. Like she needed another visual. Been there. \u201cHe was wrong.\u201d And she owed the demon for this, at least. \u201cAnd if the fire hadn\u2019t burned so fast, you\u2019d see the truth for yourself.\u201d But there\u2019d be no seeing for anyone. That demon\u2019s fire had burned right through flesh and taken all the evidence away. By the time the firefighters had arrived on the scene, nothing had been left.</p><p>The detective\u2019s scent\u2014sweat and cheap cologne\u2014clogged the air around her. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me for an enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want . . . is a lawyer.\u201d She tore her hands away from his and turned her head to glare at the mirror. \u201cAnd I want one now.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s in there.\u201d</p><p>Figured.</p><p>\u201cAnd no lawyer is coming for you.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good.</p><p>He pulled away from the table and rolled his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve got a daughter,\u201d he told her as he began to pace the small room.</p><p>Uh, what? How had they gone from dead bodies to his personal life?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s real sick.\u201d He paused and his gaze went distant. \u201cCancer. Eight years old . . . and she has cancer.\u201d</p><p>What was happening here? \u201cI\u2019m . . . sorry.\u201d And she was. No child should ever have to suffer such pain.</p><p>\u201cCops don\u2019t make much.\u201d</p><p>A chill iced her skin. No, don\u2019t say\u2014</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his face. \u201cYou\u2019re going to try and escape custody in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Rafe.</p><p>His right hand brushed back the edge of his jacket, and she saw the butt of his gun. \u201cYou\u2019re going to try to get away, but you\u2019re going to fail.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth had gone bone dry. \u201cLet me guess . . .\u201d Her hands curled under the edge of the table. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to shoot me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2019s real sick.\u201d His eyes glittered at her. \u201cShe\u2019s a little girl. She deserves to live. And you\u2014you\u2019re a killer, just like Simone. I saw the file on you. I know what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>So she wasn\u2019t perfect. \u201cWhat file? Who told you about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess Ortez.\u201d</p><p>Damn him. \u201cJess doesn\u2019t know everything.\u201d Her left arm still stung from the bullet that had clipped her. The EMTs on the scene had bandaged her up, but she knew the next wound wouldn\u2019t be one that a bandage could easily fix. Trapped in this ten-by-twelve-foot room, the cop wouldn\u2019t exactly have a hard target.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, lady, but you\u2019re worth more dead than you are alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Her hands tightened on the table. She could heave it at him, but then what? He was blocking the door and she wasn\u2019t armed. \u201cI\u2019m actually worth even more if you can bring me in alive.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and his hand stopped inching toward the holster.</p><p>She almost took a deep breath then.</p><p>But old Bruce just shook his head. \u201cBullshit, but nice try.\u201d Then his hand went to his hip.</p><p>Her body tensed in anticipation of the bullet, but he just grabbed the cuffs on his waist. \u201c \u2019Fraid you\u2019ll be coming with me.\u201d</p><p>Because he wasn\u2019t going to shoot her there. Relief had her face flushing. So she had a few more minutes to live. A good thing, right? Where was Lucas? Bruce crept close to her, nice and slow. \u201cHold out your hands.\u201d</p><p>She put them out but said, \u201cIf you cuff me, won\u2019t that mess up your whole she-was-running-story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, you\u2019ll lose the cuffs before you die.\u201d He kicked the chair out of the way and snapped the cold metal cuff around her wrist. \u201cBut if I get blood all over this room, the captain will freak.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t stupid. This was a game she knew. \u201cHe\u2019ll also want to know why the hell you were in here alone with a suspect. He\u2019ll want to know why no one was observing the interrogation, he\u2019ll want to know where my lawyer\u2014\u201d She broke off, her breath hissing out as the second cuff snapped too tightly around her wrist, digging deep into the flesh.</p><p>\u201cWe can do this two ways.\u201d His mouth was at her ear. \u201cA quick bullet in the head so you don\u2019t feel any pain . . .\u201d</p><p>She could barely feel her fingers now thanks to those cuffs. \u201cOr we can do this long and slow . . . I\u2019ll make sure you die, but I can make sure you suffer, too.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t he a prince? She swallowed and wrenched back a step, the better to see into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m someone\u2019s daughter, too, you know, asshole.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened just a bit at that.</p><p>A rap sounded at the door. \u201cHey, Langston!\u201d The door swung open and a red-haired female cop poked her head inside. \u201cYou ready to transfer her to the safe house?\u201d</p><p>The safe house? What? Was that a fun new euphemism for the cemetery?</p><p>Bruce the Bastard shook his head. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to come willingly, Shirley. I\u2019m putting her in protective custody.\u201d</p><p>Shirley shoved the door all the way open. \u201cWhat?\u201d Her gaze raked Sarah. \u201cYou barely survived this attack, and you don\u2019t want the cops to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo ways,\u201d Bruce whispered, far too quietly for Shirley to hear.</p><p>Shirley shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re so addicted to Simone that you\u2019d let him kill you?\u201d</p><p>Now this was a question she could handle. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about Lucas hurting me.\u201d Her head turned and her gaze zeroed in on Bruce. \u201cI\u2019m not the one he\u2019d come after.\u201d</p><p>His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed, and he grabbed her elbow. \u201cCome on. This is for your own protection.\u201d He dragged her toward the door, right past Shirley.</p><p>Help me, Sarah mouthed and the female cop nodded. \u201cWe will, ma\u2019am. We\u2019ll help you, if you just give us the chance.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Bruce\u2019s fingers bit into her flesh. Guess that meant she\u2019d be dying by option number two. The slow, painful death he\u2019d promised.</p><p>So what did she have to lose? \u201cHe\u2019s going to kill me, Shirley.\u201d</p><p>Bruce double-timed his pace.</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t, Ms. King! We\u2019ll keep you safe!\u201d Shirley called out, voice like some chirpy bird. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about Simone!\u201d</p><p>If only.</p><p>\u201cOne more word,\u201d Bruce muttered in her ear, \u201cand I\u2019ll break every bone in your body before you die.\u201d</p><p>Nice. Her mouth snapped shut, and her eyes rose to the crest hanging just above the exit door: To Serve and Protect.</p><p>Probably should have read to maim and kill.</p><p>Then they were outside. She tripped once on the steps. When she fell, Sarah managed to rip open the knee of her jeans and she felt the wet warmth of her blood. Lucky for her, Bruce was there to haul her back up\u2014and then after a few more stumbling steps, he shoved her into the back of a patrol car.</p><p>But, right before he slammed the door, Sarah heard the sweetest sound in the world.</p><p>The howl of a wolf.</p><p>Bruce heard it, too, because she saw the cop stiffen. Then he rushed forward and jumped into the front of the patrol car.</p><p>She slammed her cuffed hands on the dividing screen that separated them. \u201cYou heard the howl, didn\u2019t you, asshole?\u201d</p><p>He revved the engine, and the motor growled.</p><p>\u201cKnow what it means?\u201d she gritted. \u201cIt means you\u2019re the one who needs to worry about dying tonight.\u201d</p><p>The car raced onto the road. Bruce drove way too fast, weaving in and out of traffic.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d But an edge of fear had snaked into his words. \u201cThat howl could have been from the wolf who\u2019s coming to collect your body.\u201d</p><p>Rafe was coming? \u201cThat wasn\u2019t Rafe\u2019s howl.\u201d But what about one of his men? No, he wouldn\u2019t risk sending one of them. Not to her. Rafe wouldn\u2019t come close to her and neither would his wolves. But Lucas . . .</p><p>Bruce turned off the main road with a squeal of his tires. They were in a long, dark alley now. The perfect place to die. He was still driving too fast. Way too fast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slammed her fists into the screen once more. \u201cThat howl meant the wolves are coming after you!\u201d</p><p>And she saw it then, the fast, dark streak of an animal running in front of the squad car. A wolf.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Bruce\u2019s yell, and he yanked the wheel to the right. The car\u2019s fender slammed into a big, green dumpster and Sarah\u2019s head smacked into the screen.</p> <p>The world went a quick shade of gray as pain blasted through her head. She blinked a few times, and touched her head\u2014no blood. Well, that was something.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>Her head craned to the right. Bruce had her door open. His gun pointed right at her. \u201cGet out!\u201d He yelled again.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d pull her out and kill her? Because it had to look like she\u2019d run, right? \u201cMake me, asshole,\u201d she dared.</p><p>He lunged forward and grabbed her arm.</p> <p>A low, fierce growl vibrated in the air. Then . . .</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cBecause if you hurt her, I\u2019ll have to rip you open.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The cop froze, then spun to face him. Good old Bruce had his gun up, and Lucas really wasn\u2019t surprised when the asshole fired at him. Not surprised, but really pissed off.</p><p>Lucas moved, fast\u2014not fast enough\u2014and the first bullet blazed a path across the side of his shoulder. The second bullet missed, and the cop didn\u2019t get a chance to shoot the third one. Lucas caught him and slammed Bruce\u2019s back into the side of the patrol car. The cop\u2019s gun clattered to the ground.</p><p>Sarah scrambled out of the car. \u201cGet the keys to the cuffs!\u201d</p> <p>Sure, right after he sliced\u2014</p><p>\u201cLucas, he\u2019s working with Jess and Rafe!\u201d</p><p>That froze his claws. \u201cIs he now.\u201d He smiled down at the cop. Bruce\u2019s eyes were bulging.</p><p>Sarah shoved in close and ripped the keys from Bruce\u2019s belt. She fumbled a bit, swearing, as she fought the lock. He heard the soft snick, then she said, \u201cHe was going to deliver my body to them\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s teeth snapped together and his fingers squeezed that fat neck. Bruce\u2019s face went that fast, deep purple.</p><p>\u201cD-daugh . . . ter . . .\u201d The gasped word huffed from Bruce\u2019s lips.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s hand brushed over Lucas\u2019s arm. \u201cWe all have our reasons for making deals with the devil, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>What? He glanced at her, but never eased his grip. Her gaze was on him, not the cop. She seemed even paler, and the scent of smoke clung to her.</p> <p>\u201cTrust me on this, Lucas,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to kill a cop.\u201d</p><p>Actually, he did. Very much so.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders and winced a bit. \u201cIf he dies right now, guess who this will be pinned on?\u201d</p><p>It would be\u2014</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d she muttered, not giving him a chance to answer. \u201cNow ease up on him, okay? The guy\u2019s gonna black out any second.\u201d</p><p>For her, he eased his grip. Bruce sucked in a deep gulp of air.</p><p>A snarl broke from the shadows. Piers, still in wolf form.</p><p>\u201cYou stay back, too,\u201d Sarah called, huffing out a breath. \u201cWe can\u2019t kill him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need the dickhead.\u201d Bruce had been going to trade Sarah?</p><p>No, he\u2019d been ready to dump her body into the hands of the highest bidder. Fuck that. Lucas lifted the guy up and rammed him back against the patrol car. Bruce\u2019s head hit the top of the car and his eyes rolled back in his head. Lucas let the bastard drop to the ground.</p><p>Then he turned on Sarah. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d His nostrils flared. \u201cWhy do I smell your blood?\u201d And the scent was driving him crazy. The beast inside loved the smell of blood. Went wild when prey bled, but . . .</p><p>But Sarah wasn\u2019t prey, and the beast was having a whole different reaction to her blood. Kill. Punish. Destroy.</p><p>Sarah blinked at him. \u201cAh, Lucas . . .\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d already pinpointed the blood. A wound on her arm. A white bandage that was already coming loose and he could still smell\u2014\u201cYou were shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, when all hell broke loose at that place, I got caught in the cross-fire.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d left her. His fingers brushed lightly down her arm, careful to avoid the wound. \u201cYou won\u2019t get caught again.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that. A bitter, mocking laugh. \u201cDude, getting caught is the story of my life.\u201d</p><p>His back teeth clenched.</p><p>Sarah glanced over her shoulder. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t get out of here soon, more cops will be on the scene and we\u2019ll both get tossed in cages.\u201d</p><p>Not gonna happen. \u201cYou smell like ash.\u201d</p><p>Her chin shot up. \u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s better than smelling like shit.\u201d</p><p>What? A quick laugh broke from him.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>Oh, damn, but she was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it, Sarah,\u201d he warned her, as the laughter faded as quickly as it had come.</p><p>She eased away from him. Was she afraid? Finally. She should be afraid. If she knew everything he wanted to do to her, she\u2019d be fucking terrified.</p><p>\u201cD-do what?\u201d She almost tripped over the gun Bruce had dropped. She bent and scooped it up with fingers that shook. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything to you.\u201d</p><p>She was, even if she didn\u2019t realize it. If he wanted a woman too much\u2014the way I want Sarah\u2014that lust could become dangerous. To her and to him.</p><p>But I already want her too much. So much that I can taste her on my tongue. Not ash and blood. Sweet candy.</p><p>Her gaze searched the darkness of the alley. \u201cTell me you have a car around here.\u201d</p><p>Even better, he\u2019d stashed his motorcycle. He\u2019d followed her from the station, taken a shortcut and managed to head them off.</p><p>He held out his hand to her. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dropped to the hand. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be coming for me.\u201d</p><p>Trust? From her? Her fingers rose and curled around his offered hand. Her touch was soft, warm. The cop would have killed her.</p><p>He slanted a glance toward the shadows, where he knew Piers waited for orders. \u201cI\u2019m getting her back to the main house. You take care of him.\u201d</p><p>Piers would understand.</p><p>Lucas caught the slight relaxing of Sarah\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThere\u2019s just some blood you don\u2019t want on your hands,\u201d she said.</p><p>They walked away from the cop. Lucas steered her to the left, toward his motorcycle and away from Piers.</p><p>They\u2019d taken about five steps when he heard the soft rustle of clothes, then a soft click. Fuck. Every cop had a backup weapon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gettin\u2019 that damn money!\u201d Bruce shouted. \u201cI need it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas shoved Sarah to the ground and whirled with claws up. Piers snarled as he lunged from the shadows.</p><p>Bruce crouched on the ground, the weapon aimed, a twisted smile on his face. \u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 that bounty\u2014\u201d</p><p>A bullet slammed into Bruce\u2019s chest just as the cop fired his gun. Bruce blinked, once, twice, and a gurgle rolled in his throat. His body slumped, and he managed, \u201cKel . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-Lucas?\u201d Sarah grabbed him and spun him to face her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been shot. He glanced down. Blood stained his shirt but he hadn\u2019t even felt the hit. After so many bullets, sometimes you didn\u2019t feel the pain. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he told her and then he realized\u2014</p><p>Sarah had the cop\u2019s gun in her right hand. She\u2019d taken out the bastard.</p><p>Her gaze met his. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to kill him.\u201d Tears misted her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you feel better . . .\u201d He took the gun from her and tucked it in the back of his jeans. He\u2019d get rid of that for her soon enough and make sure that it never surfaced again. \u201cThere was never any chance the guy was making it out of this alley alive.\u201d</p><p>They had to hurry. The sun would be up soon. More eyes would be on the streets. And there was always the chance someone had heard that gunshot.</p><p>He glanced toward the wolf. The order to Piers still stood. Take care of him. That body wouldn\u2019t be found, and they\u2019d make sure the patrol car was stripped down to nothing.</p><p>\u201cHe had a daughter,\u201d sadness softened Sarah\u2019s voice. \u201cA family . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucas pulled her through the alley. \u201cHis daughter died a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>He jumped onto the motorcycle. \u201cClimb on, and hold tight.\u201d He could feel the wound now, a dull throb in his gut, but he wasn\u2019t looking at the damage. Not now. Get her to safety. Sarah had been in danger enough for one night. \u201cHis daughter Kelly died a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure of that?\u201d</p><p>Lucas grunted as he shoved back the kickstand. \u201cI make it my business to know everything about my enemies.\u201d All their strengths and all their weak spots. Little Kelly Langston had died almost twelve months ago, then her mother had packed up and left Bruce.</p><p>The cop had already been on the take then. From what Lucas had learned, Bruce had first started taking the bribes to pay for the girl\u2019s medical bills. That\u2019s how it had started but once you started down that road . . .</p><p>There was no going back.</p><p>The engine roared to life. Her fingers wrapped around his waist, her thighs pressed into his hips.</p><p>He turned to look at her once more. Their faces were close, just inches apart. A tear had slid down her cheek and that made the rage inside pulse harder. \u201cYou should be harder than you are.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cHe would have blown us both to hell in an instant.\u201d And Lucas was furious\u2014at the cop, at himself, at her. He didn\u2019t like seeing pain in her eyes. Didn\u2019t fucking like it at all\u2014and that just made him angrier. \u201cDon\u2019t waste tears on him. Don\u2019t waste a fucking moment of your life on him.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the helmet and shoved it onto her head. \u201cHold on.\u201d He turned away from her, his fingers gripping the handlebars too tightly. The motorcycle jumped forward, and they roared through the night.</p><p>Now she had blood on her hands, too. But was it her first kill? I make it a point to know my enemies. Sarah wasn\u2019t an enemy, but he still needed to know everything about her. And soon, he would know . . . everything.</p><p>There was no room for secrets between lovers.</p><p>Rafael Santiago watched as the motorcycle streaked through the streets. Sarah was clutching tightly to the wolf, holding him as if her life depended on him. In a way, it did.</p><p>The cop was dead. Taken down by her hand. Not surprising. Sarah knew how to eliminate threats to herself. He\u2019d seen the hit as he watched carefully through the binoculars. No point in getting too close and letting the others catch his scent. The game shouldn\u2019t end too soon.</p><p>All the players weren\u2019t even in place yet.</p><p>He turned away from the edge of the roof. People were wrong about wolf shifters. They weren\u2019t all psychotic, wild beasts driven by instinct. Wolves were smart, and they could also be very patient . . . particularly when it came to hunting. Some prey took time and skill to catch. But that was part of the thrill of the hunt. Easy prey didn\u2019t make for a good game.</p><p>A few more days, then all would be ready. Lucas had almost revealed a weak spot. Perfect.</p><p>Rafe already knew Sarah\u2019s weakness. Knew it, accepted it, but still loved her. After all, wolves mated for life. You didn\u2019t turn away from a lover just because of a weakness.</p><p>He took his time heading down the stairs. He\u2019d pay a visit to the coyotes soon. Ortez had promised him that the cop would handle Sarah, but that asshole human had tried to kill her.</p><p>Rafe didn\u2019t want Sarah dead. Punished, not dead.</p><p>Coyotes. They had their uses. Greedy, strong . . . but they had their weaknesses. And Jess Ortez\u2014the shifter was a wannabe, playing far out of his league.</p><p>Rafe had planned to use Ortez as a distraction, and so far, that plan was working fucking beautifully. Ortez actually thought he\u2019d get this land for his coyotes when the battle was over.</p><p>Damn fool.</p><p>Good thing Rafe hadn\u2019t aligned with just one coyote group. But then, he\u2019d formed a pact with Hayden O\u2019Connor years ago. And if he wanted Hayden to keep helping him, then he had to give the bastard what he wanted.</p><p>Sorry, Ortez, you\u2019re about to visit hell.</p><p>The coyote would never even see the danger coming.</p><p>It was often hard to see it\u2014especially when your own kind was the one doing the killing.</p><p>Steam rose from the bath water, swirling in the air around her. Sarah had her knees drawn up in the water, her arms wrapped tightly around them.</p><p>Killed a man.</p><p>Not the first time. Not even the second, but unlike Rafe, she\u2019d never been able to turn off her emotions after a kill.</p><p>Rafe.</p><p>She\u2019d almost felt him tonight. Had he been there? Ready to slice her open?</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. You had to kill the cop.</p><p>Right. No choice. Kill or be killed. That was the way of the wolf, right?</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not a fucking wolf,\u201d she rasped, and in her mind, she could still see that bloom of red on the cop\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s hard voice had her eyes flashing open as she shot up in the tub. Water jostled over the side of the old-fashioned bear-claw bathtub. A big tub. Big enough for . . .</p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt. A white bandage lined his left side. Faded jeans hung low on his hips.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She squeezed her knees tighter.</p><p>His gaze raked her. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>Her belly clenched. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt, you should be . . .\u201d</p><p>A shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t even feel it. I dug the bullet out, slapped a bandage on it.\u201d His lips quirked. \u201cThe wound will be healed in no time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because blood, pain, and bullets were nothing to a wolf. What was the little matter of death to a beast?</p><p>His eyes narrowed on her and Lucas crossed the room in long, slow strides. Stalking me. Goosebumps rose on the flesh of her arms. \u201cLucas . . .\u201d</p><p>He knelt beside the tub. His fingers dipped into the warm water, his knuckles so close to her thigh.</p> <p>She hunched her shoulders. \u201cI didn\u2019t . . .\u201d Invite you here. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here. Where else should I be?\u201d His fingers trailed in the water and slid over her thigh. \u201cDon\u2019t you want me here?\u201d</p><p>Yes, dammit. She did. She\u2019d wanted him, secretly, desperately, and quite stupidly, for a long time now. Before they\u2019d ever met.</p><p>She stared at his hand in the water. There was no point lying to him. He\u2019d smell her arousal anyway.</p><p>Just the touch of his fingers and she was almost trembling.</p> <p>\u201cI came in just to make sure you were all right.\u201d His voice seemed so deep and dark.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d Hers was a whisper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I came in . . .\u201d His fingers curled over her thigh. Her nipples tightened. The warm water was no longer soothing. Nothing could soothe her then. \u201cBut I\u2019m here now,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I fucking want you.\u201d</p><p>Sarah swallowed.</p><p>His hand tightened on her. She wanted him to move those fingers, to slide them deeper under the water, to press them against her sex, into her.</p><p>He released her. \u201cBut you\u2019re the one who has to say\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Her hand flew up and she grabbed his wrist, held on way too tight. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d Right then, being alone was the last thing she wanted. Remembering blood, pain, death\u2014no, thank you.</p><p>She wanted passion. She wanted pleasure. She wanted him. A muscle flexed in his jaw. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>She rose from the tub, slowly, and the water slid down her body even as the steam drifted around her head. \u201cI want you.\u201d Admissions didn\u2019t get more stark than that.</p><p>His lips lifted in a half-smile that revealed the sharp points of his teeth. \u201cThen that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting.\u201d</p><p>He pounced. No other word for it. Lucas moved in a blur, grabbing her and lifting her out of the tub. Her hands flew out and clutched his shoulders as she tried to balance herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d he said and he lifted her higher. Strong wolf. He took her breast in his mouth, licking the moisture away, sucking the aching nipple.</p><p>Liquid heat shot straight to her sex. His jeans rubbed against her legs, and she wanted to spread her thighs. Wanted to wrap them around his hips and hold on tight as he thrust deep inside. As deep as he could go.</p><p>His tongue worked her nipple, making her twist against him, making her pant, making her want.</p> <p>His breath blew over her skin as his head lifted. \u201cSo fucking sweet . . .\u201d His gaze burned into hers. \u201cAre you like that everywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>In four strides, he had her at the bed. He spun, dropping her lightly on the mattress, and then came down on top of her as he caged her against the bed. The mattress dipped beneath their weight and Sarah lifted her hands, wanting to touch him so badly that her fingers shook.</p><p>His smile flashed again. \u201cDo anything you want, Sarah. I sure will.\u201d And he licked her other breast. Licked and sucked and when she felt the light edge of his teeth, Sarah bucked off the bed.</p><p>Her hips slammed up against his, and there was no mistaking the thick bulge of his arousal. Long and hard. She wanted him inside her. \u201cLucas!\u201d Her hands buried in the thick darkness of his hair.</p><p>The water was drying fast from her skin. Thanks to the thick comforter, his mouth, and his hot flesh. She seemed to burn everywhere she touched him, her body so sensitive, too ready.</p><p>Then he started to lick his way down her body . . .</p><p>Her eyes squeezed closed and her breath came faster. She heard an eager moan fill the air\u2014me, that\u2019s me. Because the need inside her was blazing out of control. Burning so hot\u2014burning just like Lucas.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to ask . . . when his mouth pressed a kiss to her stomach, she parted her thighs wider. Why pretend? She wanted his mouth on her. No, right then, she needed it. Because her whole body was coiled tight, her sex so eager and hungry, and the pleasure he promised was so close.</p><p>How long had it been? How long since she\u2019d just let go with a lover? Trusting him to give her the pleasure she needed? With Rafe, she\u2019d never been able to let go. Not fully.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s fingers touched her first. Strong, rough fingertips that parted the folds between her legs and found the center of her need. His lips touched her next, pressing against her clit, sending a fierce, sensual jolt through her body that was so strong that she would have flinched away . . . but his hands were on her wrists\u2014when had he grabbed her?\u2014holding her tight.</p><p>Then came his tongue. Wet and warm. Licking. Caressing. Sliding against flesh and then thrusting inside her core.</p><p>Her hips arched toward him. More. The whisper in her mind. So close, she was so close and she just needed\u2014</p><p>\u201cEven sweeter,\u201d he growled the words against her. Then his tongue plunged deep, his fingers stroked her, and Sarah came against his mouth.</p><p>When he growled, a long, ragged rumble, the vibration trembled against her sex and the wave of pleasure lashed through her body.</p><p>Then he was moving, shoving off the jeans, jerking on a condom, and coming back to her with eyes that were far too bright for a human\u2019s. But then, she\u2019d known he was more than just a man from the beginning.</p><p>He pushed her legs farther apart. The tip of his thick cock pressed against her sensitive flesh, flesh that was still ready and eager for more.</p><p>But . . .</p><p>But she could see the edge of his teeth. So sharp. And those eyes were more wolf than man.</p><p>A shiver slipped over her as the past whispered around her. Her hands flew up and pushed against his shoulders. Lucas froze.</p><p>Pleasure still hummed through her body. Lust had her aching, but\u2014but . . .</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re scared.\u201d Gravel-rough. He shook his head and leaned in close to her, so close those glowing eyes bored into hers. His lips were just a few inches away from her mouth. All the while, his cock lodged right at the entrance of her body. Not thrusting inside, not yet, and not withdrawing.</p><p>Her nails bit into the hard muscles of his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he said, voice dark and dangerous, \u201cbut deep down, you\u2019re scared as hell of me.\u201d</p><p>Not deep down. Right then, the fear was on the surface, fighting her need. \u201cIt\u2019s not you I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d The damn memories. Her own past.</p><p>Not Lucas\u2014not the man anyway, but the wolf she could see gazing back from the man\u2019s eyes. If a wolf got too strong, grew too wild during sex, the man would lose control, he would\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat fucking bastard hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. He already knew Rafe had tried to kill her but...</p><p>Lucas\u2019s mouth pressed against her cheek. A light touch when she\u2019d expected force and fire. \u201cHow many times,\u201d he gritted, \u201cdo I have to tell you? All fucking wolves aren\u2019t the same in the dark. We\u2019re not all psychotic bastards.\u201d</p><p>His lips trailed down her cheek. Under the line of her jaw. Just lips and tongue, kissing, licking, caressing. No teeth. No pain.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he breathed the words against her and the fear began to give way once more to the need and the lust that tightened her body. \u201cLet me show you what I\u2019m like.\u201d</p><p>Her nails stopped digging into his chest. Her fingers curled over his shoulders, the better to pull closer, not to push away.</p><p>His head lifted and those blazing blue eyes stared into hers. \u201cTrust me,\u201d he said again.</p><p>His mouth took hers. A hot, open-mouthed kiss of hunger and lust. Of need and\u2014</p><p>His cock pushed into her. Not a hard, slamming thrust. A gentle drive of thick, strong flesh, a glide that sent his cock sliding over her clit, making her arch and gasp beneath him.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>And it was. He was. The past disappeared as he withdrew. His fingers pushed between them, found the center of her desire, teased, pressed\u2014</p><p>He thrust. A little harder this time, a little deeper.</p><p>Just right.</p><p>Again. Again.</p><p>His fingers touched, stroked, knew just where she needed him. His cock filled her, so heavy and thick, and her sex clamped greedily around him as the lust built and built.</p><p>His mouth was on hers again. Tongue thrusting. Tasting, taking, even as his body took hers.</p><p>He was all she could see, everything she felt. Her sex strained around him, the pleasure pressing close again, and when his cock drove into her, a plunge that stole her breath\u2014Sarah came, gasping, body shuddering, as the release blasted through her.</p><p>He kept thrusting. Faster now, deeper. Harder. The pleasure shook her body, had her heart racing as the drumming filled her ears.</p><p>She stared up at him, the taut lines of his face, those eyes . . .</p><p>His jaw was clenched, his muscles bulging.</p><p>Sarah wrapped her legs around him and held him tighter.</p><p>Then she saw the wild rush of pleasure in his eyes as he came. Lucas thrust deep and stiffened against her. His hands caught hers. His cock jerked inside her with the hard jet of his release.</p><p>And he never looked away from her gaze.</p><p>Man, not beast.</p><p>No, both. But with Lucas, the man was in control.</p><p>His lips brushed hers. She kissed him, closing her eyes. Dammit, why did it have to be like this? A man of power, a man that she might truly be able to trust, and a man that she was deceiving.</p><p>What would happen when he found out the truth?</p><p>His lips broke from hers, and he searched her gaze.</p><p>There\u2019d be no running from him.</p><p>\u201cYou trust me.\u201d No question from Lucas. Just a statement now.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And it was the truth. But please, don\u2019t trust me. Whatever you do . . . don\u2019t trust me.</p><p>Because sooner or later, she\u2019d have to betray him. Life could be such a bitch sometimes.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes opened the instant he heard the light scratch on the door. He turned at once, and his gaze landed on Sarah.</p><p>Sarah.</p><p>What in the hell was he going to do with her? Careless, mind-numbing sex was one thing\u2014but not what he\u2019d had with her.</p><p>She\u2019d been afraid. He\u2019d had other lovers who were afraid. Others who sensed the beast he kept chained, but had still wanted the wild ride in the darkness.</p><p>Sarah had been different. Wanting him despite the fear. And the damn thing was . . . of all his lovers, he\u2019d expected her to fear the least.</p><p>The woman talked to wolves. She knew them. Maybe that was the problem. Maybe she knew just how strong the beast inside could be, particularly when he wanted something.</p><p>Rafe had hurt her. He\u2019d seen that truth in her gaze. I\u2019ve only had one wolf lover.</p><p>One who\u2019d taught her to fear a shifter\u2019s touch.</p><p>The scratch at the door came again. Shit. Caleb. He\u2019d sent the shifter to make contact with Dane and to get a report on the coyotes.</p><p>He needed to go, but . . . his gaze turned to Sarah once more, just as she rolled onto her stomach. Her sheet dipped with her movement, and he saw the sexy curve of her spine, and the long, still-pink scars that marred the flesh on her lower back.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t make a sound. Didn\u2019t snarl. Didn\u2019t howl with the sudden fury inside him. His hand reached toward her, his claws springing forth, and he didn\u2019t feel the tear of his flesh.</p><p>His hand hovered over those lines. A perfect match. But then, there really was no mistaking clawmarks on a woman\u2019s body.</p><p>No fucking wonder she feared me.</p><p>He leaned in close to her. Didn\u2019t touch her. Couldn\u2019t, not then, because the beast was far too angry then. \u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d he whispered the words in her ear.</p><p>Sarah stiffened. \u201cWh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna make damn sure the bastard suffers before I put him out of his misery.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him, her eyes wide, her lips still red from his kiss. \u201cLucas, I need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He rolled away from her. \u201cGet some sleep.\u201d If he stayed . . . no. Fuck, no. \u201cI\u2019m going for a run.\u201d Because the beast was howling inside.</p><p>The bedcovers rustled behind him. \u201cNo! Wait, Lucas! We\u2019ve got to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d No time. He glanced down and saw that his claws were still out. Claws just like the ones that had ripped into her skin.</p><p>I\u2019ll rip him open.</p><p>Her hand grabbed his arm. \u201cOh, what, you got what you wanted, so now you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her touch burned through him. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood to fuck or kill.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He glanced back at her. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to be touching me now.\u201d The beast would be staring at her from his eyes, he knew that. And she feared the beast.</p><p>Sarah swallowed, but she didn\u2019t drop her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the scars.\u201d</p><p>The wolf clawed inside, desperate to be free.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his hands, yeah, right to those claws. Razor-sharp. Perfect for tearing flesh.</p><p>\u201cWere your claws out during sex?\u201d She shook her head, a frown between her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t even notice. I should have, but . . .\u201d Her gaze rose back to his. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice.\u201d There was shock in her voice.</p><p>Should he tell her the truth? Lie? Fuck it. \u201cThey were out.\u201d It had taken all his damn strength to keep a stranglehold on the beast. Fighting or fucking\u2014the wolf liked both. Sarah would know that, though.</p><p>She had the marks to prove it.</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>He stepped away from her, breaking her hold. The wolf wanted out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d she told him again. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t know about me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cBabe, tell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d But now wasn\u2019t the time for talking. The wolf wanted to run. No, he wanted to kill, and maybe Caleb had news on those coyotes that would let him do just that.</p><p>Rip. Claw. Blood.</p> <p>A fist shook the door. \u201cLucas! I know you can hear me!\u201d Caleb. But with an edge to his voice. Guess the guy\u2019s patience had run out. Not that the Texan ever really had much patience.</p><p>Lucas yanked open the door. Caleb\u2019s narrowed eyes met his. \u201cI can\u2019t make contact with Dane.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cWe sent scouts to the area. There were signs of a fight, and the coyotes are locked down tight now.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s gaze drifted to Sarah. Widened a bit.</p> <p>Because Sarah was only wearing a sheet. Lucas stepped to the left, blocking the view. \u201cDid the scouts catch Dane\u2019s scent?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s gaze snapped back to him. \u201cThey . . . thought they picked up his scent in one of the houses but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re going to fucking get our man back.\u201d The wolf howled inside. Just what he needed. Blood and death and fury. \u201cI\u2019m tired of screwing with the coyotes. Time to break that pack.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s lips twisted into a savage grin. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the wolves it\u2019s time to hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Sarah touched him again. Dammit. He knew Caleb noticed the slight jerk of his body. Toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at that. \u201cBabe, I can do anything.\u201d She looked so delicate, so sexy with her hair mussed and his scent on her. His scent, not his mark.</p><p>Already been marked by that fucking bastard.</p><p>Rip. Him. Apart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of the wolf in me.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to keep his voice low. Caleb would hear no matter what with his shifter ears. \u201cFair warning, that wolf is hungry, and he\u2019s about to come out.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him go. Surprising. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>He knew his smile held a razor\u2019s edge. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who has to worry.\u201d No more playing nice with the coyotes. They\u2019d come at him . . . my turn.</p><p>The idiots probably thought he\u2019d wait until the cover of darkness to attack. The better to not be seen by humans. What they didn\u2019t understand . . . he didn\u2019t give a fuck about the humans. They had Dane, the wolf who\u2019d stood by him in hell, and in order to get his friend back, Lucas would cut through anyone who got in his way.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s gaze held his. After a moment, her hand fell away, and he went to hunt.</p> <p>With her scent on him.</p><p>Sarah watched him leave through the window. Lucas had to know she was there, but he didn\u2019t glance up at her, not even once. He left as a man, loading into the SUV with the others, but she knew he\u2019d soon be shedding the cover of flesh for the power of fur and fangs and claws.</p><p>The sheet felt cool around her body, and damn if she didn\u2019t still feel the press of his hands and lips on her.</p><p>What was happening? She\u2019d thought sex might be a possibility, but . . .</p><p>But she was weakening with the wolf. She\u2019d almost told him the truth before he left. Talk about crap timing. With his wolf so close\u2014that would have been a nightmare.</p><p>The sun beamed down from overhead. Attacking in daylight. Figured that would be something Lucas would do.</p><p>The SUVs disappeared along the winding road.</p><p>Her gaze darted to the left. To the phone that waited on the nightstand. Should she call and give a warning?</p><p>She was at the phone before she gave herself time for second thoughts. One ring. Two. Answer. Lucas knew exactly where the coyotes were hiding. The bloodbath would be brutal. She\u2019d seen what he could do when he was the only one fighting.</p><p>How fast would they all die when the wolf pack attacked?</p><p>Another ring. Not answering.</p><p>She slammed the phone down. Dressed as fast as she could. Then Sarah ran for the door. She wrenched it open\u2014</p><p>And found herself staring up into a pair of golden eyes. She stumbled to a stop right before she slammed into the human wall.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d he asked, crossing his arms over his chest and thoroughly blocking her way. He was young, probably barely in his early twenties\u2014not much younger than me\u2014but his face . . . like Lucas\u2019s. The same hard chin. The same cheeks. His eyes held the same hard edge, even though the color was different. But then, she\u2019d seen those eyes before.</p><p>The wolf who came to greet Lucas the first day. Sarah forced her shoulders to relax. \u201cYou\u2019re Jordan.\u201d</p><p>His dark brows rose. \u201cLucas told you about me?\u201d He even had the same thick, dark hair that Lucas had.</p><p>No. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you.\u201d About the young wolf who\u2019d once been taken by a band of vamps. Lucas had become legend when he\u2019d gone after them and destroyed the bloodsuckers. Don\u2019t fuck with the LA pack.</p><p>That message had been loud and clear for years. Until Rafe\u2019s patience had worn too thin. He\u2019d wanted to be the legend.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s gaze searched her face. \u201cYou\u2019re my brother\u2019s lover.\u201d Said without inflection.</p><p>Her shoulders stiffened. So much for relaxing. \u201cI\u2019m sure you brother has plenty of lovers.\u201d Okay, now why did that actually hurt? Wolves were sexual, she knew that. Fucking was sometimes as necessary as breathing.</p><p>\u201cNone that he ever brings around the pack.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>His head cocked. \u201cYou going somewhere?\u201d Now an edge of steel had crept into his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t think Lucas would like to come back and find you missing.\u201d</p><p>There was a reason the wolf had survived capture by the vamps. He had a core of fire inside. Strength that was apparent in the hard stare of his eyes.</p><p>Not a kid. She\u2019d been foolish to make that mistake when he was in wolf form. She\u2019d been nervous because of Lucas, and hadn\u2019t been focusing enough. This wasn\u2019t a kid. This was definitely a grown man. A very dangerous man.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think Lucas wanted you . . .\u201d Near me. Ah, how could she put this delicately? \u201cI thought you were out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me to keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>While the others hunted.</p><p>His gaze dropped to rake her body. \u201cSo here I am.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>His stance widened, and the smile he gave her wasn\u2019t pretty. \u201cAnd trust me on this, you\u2019re not going anywhere. Not until the pack is back, safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>She recognized the look in his eyes. She\u2019d seen it plenty of times. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone who isn\u2019t pack.\u201d</p><p>While similar to Lucas, she realized that Jordan\u2019s face wasn\u2019t as hard. More handsome, less dangerous. But the threat was still in him.</p><p>\u201cI was just going down to the kitchen.\u201d She put her hand on her stomach. \u201cI skipped a meal last night. What with the fire and attempted murder and everything.\u201d</p><p>No smile curved his lips, but he did step back, giving her space to cross over the threshold.</p><p>Guess that meant she got to eat.</p><p>Sarah had taken five steps down the hallway when she heard the smash of glass. Jordan lunged in front of her, and she saw the deadly flash of his claws.</p><p>The scent of blood filled the air. The wolves growled behind Lucas, their instinct to lunge forward and attack. Blood always drew them in . . .</p><p>Lucas let the shift sweep over him, barely feeling the burn of the change. The crack and snap of bones filled his ears, drowning out those growls as the wolf inside was\u2014fucking finally\u2014free.</p><p>He sprang forward, his paws slamming down on the earth and the others were right on his heels, racing forward toward the line of buildings nestled near the woods.</p><p>No mercy. He sent out the order, knowing the others would understand. If they showed mercy now, word would spread that their pack was weak. Too many bastards were already trying to come after them. Too many enemies needed to learn to stay away.</p><p>The coyotes deserved what was coming for them with hungry jaws and sharpened claws.</p><p>He burst through the window, and the glass shattered around him.</p><p>\u201cGet back in your room!\u201d Jordan ordered, never glancing back. \u201cLock the door and stay there!\u201d</p><p>He raced for the stairs.</p><p>Because she wasn\u2019t a fool, she raced back for her room. She hurried inside. Slammed the door shut. Clicked the lock, thought about hauling the dresser over in front of the door and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hard woman to catch, Sarah King.\u201d A low, taunting growl.</p><p>She froze, her eyes on the closed, bolted door. If she\u2019d been a shifter, she probably would have caught his scent in time, but...</p><p>But he\u2019d known she wouldn\u2019t sense him.</p><p>The floor creaked as he came closer. \u201cWatching you run was fun, but the chase is coming to an end now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she whispered, then she screamed, \u201cJordan, help me!\u201d</p><p>The bastard slammed her head into the door.</p><p>Bodies littered the floor. Coyote shifters who\u2019d been slaughtered. The wolves sniffed the air, moving carefully now.</p><p>Someone had beaten them to the kill.</p><p>When he\u2019d landed on the floor, he\u2019d landed in the middle of the bodies.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>Jess lay with his head twisted, his eyes open, and his throat gone.</p><p>Looked like the coyote leader wasn\u2019t going to be a threat to him anymore. Not to him, not to anyone.</p><p>Dane. His only concern then. The wolves broke up into groups and began searching. The scent of coyote was all over the place. Coyote . . . and wolf. Blood and death.</p><p>More bodies littered the floor as they tracked through the house. No survivors.</p><p>The killers had been fast and brutal. The dead were still fresh. They must have missed the slaughter by minutes.</p><p>They searched all the houses, every room. He caught the wolf\u2019s scent, but Dane was gone.</p><p>Not dead, maybe, but gone.</p><p>Piers snarled as he crouched over a pair of handcuffs. Silver.</p><p>The coyotes had been prepared for Dane, but not for whoever had ripped through them.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s gaze swept the house once more, the fury building in the wolf as the scent of blood filled his nose.</p><p>I don\u2019t like this. From Caleb.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it a damn bit, either. Whoever had attacked the coyotes\u2014someone strong. Damn strong.</p><p>Coyote and wolf scents were all over the fucking place.</p><p>The coyotes had been caught unprepared because they\u2019d thought they were letting in an ally. An ally who\u2019d sliced them apart.</p><p>Shit. He whirled away and ran back for the darkness. Someone else was hunting out there. Someone strong\u2014a lot of fucking someones. He\u2019d find them.</p><p>The world dimmed when her head rammed into the wood, but Sarah didn\u2019t pass out. No, that would have been too easy.</p><p>The bastard grabbed her and picked her up, forcing her to face him as he smiled down at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been too long, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and stared up into his squinty brown eyes. She knew those eyes, they were very distinct with that faint yellow that circled his pupil. Oh, yeah, she knew him. Knew that thick blond hair, that deceptively handsome face. Those too-sharp teeth. Hayden. The coyote who\u2019d started this hell with Rafe. \u201cHayden, how did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah!\u201d Jordan\u2019s fists pounded into the door and the whole room seemed to shake.</p><p>Hayden smiled. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s strong enough to get in . . .\u201d That smile widened as his claws rose to her throat. \u201cBefore I slit your pretty, lying throat?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>The room shook again.</p><p>Hayden\u2019s lips came close, feathering over her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sarah, I\u2019m not going to kill you . . . yet,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSomeone wants to see you first.\u201d</p><p>Her heart seemed to stop. Rafe.</p><p>\u201cBut I did kill all the bastards in my way.\u201d He caught her chin and forced her head toward him. \u201cGuess who\u2019s the king coyote now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Those claws pressed into her throat. Sarah gasped, ready to\u2014</p><p>The door exploded behind them, the wood shattering and hitting Sarah and Hayden. She stumbled and grabbed tight to the coyote\u2014and took him down with her.</p><p>They rolled, twisting and jerking, and Jordan attacked. He grabbed Hayden, slicing with his claws, and Sarah scrambled back.</p><p>The shift started then. A fierce, hard explosion of bones and flesh. The men fought as they shifted, and it was the most savage thing she\u2019d ever seen. Claws buried into flesh, fur exploded. Spines snapped.</p><p>She backed away, crawling fast. Her gaze darted toward the door. Now was her chance. She could run through that door and get away.</p><p>Sarah started to inch forward.</p><p>Kill the bastard. Kill the assholes waiting . . .</p><p>Jordan\u2019s thoughts, slipping so easily into her mind. Hold on\u2014whoa\u2014the assholes waiting? There were more?</p><p>She stopped inching anywhere. Her gaze darted to the window. Open\u2014had Hayden climbed up to get to her? That would have been easy enough for a shifter.</p><p>Dammit, Lucas\u2014come back.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s heartbeat shook her chest. Two choices\u2014run and face who the hell knew what below . . .</p><p>Or help Jordan and face \u2019em together.</p><p>Not really a choice.</p><p>She grabbed the lamp, and when the two beasts broke apart, she threw it at the coyote\u2019s head. It shattered, but didn\u2019t seem to hurt Hayden at all. Then those brown eyes locked on her. Fury and hate blazed in his gaze.</p><p>Hayden lunged for her.</p><p>Sarah jumped away, narrowly missing a swipe of those claws.</p><p>Jordan leapt onto the back of the coyote. The two spun, slamming around the room, crashing into furniture, breaking the bed, knocking over the bookshelf. Howls and snarls filled the room. And as they fought, the scent of blood grew thicker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hayden tossed Jordan off him. The coyote stood in front of the windows, his lips stained red with blood. The fur on his back was up, his eyes glinting as he prepared for another charge.</p><p>Jordan, take that bastard out!</p><p>The wolf leapt forward, colliding hard with the coyote, but the wolf was stronger\u2014and he pushed the coyote back, back\u2014</p> <p>And glass exploded as they both tumbled through the window.</p><p>Oh, shit. She jumped to her feet and ran forward. \u201cJordan!\u201d If that wolf had been killed defending her . . . Lucas would go crazy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t touch the jagged glass as she bent forward and peered below. The wolf had landed on top of the coyote. Neither were moving, and she could see the dark circles of blood blooming beneath their bodies.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d whispered now.</p><p>More growls sounded then. Big gray and tan coyotes crept from the edge of the house and circled the fallen shifters. As Sarah watched, the fur began to melt from Jordan\u2019s body. If he was still alive, he\u2019d be helpless in human form. Easy prey for the coyotes.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t let that happen. My fault. \u201cUp here!\u201d She screamed and the three coyotes turned their bright eyes on her. \u201cI\u2019m the one you want!\u201d So come and get me, assholes.</p><p>Then they spun around and raced back to the house. Back to her.</p><p>Sarah grabbed a chunk of broken glass and went to meet them.</p><p>Lucas knew something was wrong even before he smelled the blood drifting in the air. The shifters were quiet in the SUV. No one speaking, all too aware of what the heavy smell meant.</p><p>Death.</p><p>\u201cDrive fucking faster,\u201d he snarled as his hands clamped around the console. His claws burst out and ripped through the leather. A trick. They\u2019d gone after the coyotes, found nothing but a slaughter, and someone had gone to his house while it was undefended.</p> <p>My fault. Should have left more men.</p><p>But he\u2019d thought he was eliminating the threat against Sarah.</p><p>Should have fucking known better.</p><p>The fury had just been riding him too hard.</p><p>Clawmarks on pale white skin.</p><p>Sarah.</p><p>The SUV\u2019s motor growled with him, a long, horrible snarl as it raced forward. If Sarah had been hurt . . .</p><p>He saw the broken window first, because his eyes went instantly to her room. Saw the broken window, the jagged glass\u2014then his eyes fell below as he sprang from the vehicle.</p> <p>Nothing.</p><p>A stain of blood. No bodies.</p><p>\u201cCoyote,\u201d Piers muttered, sniffing. \u201cFucking everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He knew that, he also knew . . . \u201cJordan.\u201d He\u2019d never forget the scent of his brother\u2019s blood. For months, he\u2019d only had that scent to track as he fought to rescue Jordan from the vamp bastards who\u2019d taken him, the bastards who\u2019d planned to use his brother as food for a Born Master, a damn all-powerful vampire asshole.</p><p>But even all-powerful vamps can burn.</p><p>So where the hell was his brother? And where was Sarah?</p><p>The windows on the first floor had also been shattered, the glass knocked inward, not outward, and the alarm blared constantly, a shrill buzz that drove him insane as he raced toward the house.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell back!\u201d Sarah\u2019s scream. Fear and fury burned in her voice.</p><p>He ran faster, shoving open the door and hurrying into the den\u2014</p><p>Three bleeding coyotes circled Sarah. She had a bloody chunk of glass in her hand and she had that weapon up, ready to strike again, but then all three coyotes lunged at her, attacking at once.</p><p>Hell, no.</p><p>Lucas roared and jumped forward. His claws buried into the side of one coyote as he ripped the bastard back. Sarah swiped out at another, cutting deep and hard near his eye. The third bastard drove into her, slamming her back against the wall.</p><p>Lucas grabbed him, held tight when the coyote snapped back his head and bit him. Bastard. He\u2019d shift and take the asshole out, he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>A gunshot thundered.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>The coyotes fell to the floor. The fur began to melt from their bodies.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s gaze widened as she looked first at the fallen men, then at\u2014</p><p>Lucas spun around, putting his body in front of hers.</p><p>Jordan.</p><p>His brother stood in the doorway, naked, blood covering his body, his hand still aiming the gun he held. Piers and Caleb crowded in behind him, their faces tense.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t . . . shift . . . went to help her . . .\u201d Jordan\u2019s eyes narrowed on the coyote shifters. \u201cTook . . . longer than I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Caleb grabbed him under the arms when Jordan started to slip. Piers snatched the gun away.</p><p>His brother was a damn fine shot, but then, Lucas had taught him to be. Lucas\u2019s gaze dropped to the shifters. One head shot, one heart shot . . . and one lucky-ass survivor who was groaning and twitching as the blood pumped out of his chest.</p><p>\u201cPiers, get this bastard contained!\u201d He grabbed Sarah\u2019s hand and pulled her forward. So much blood. \u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>His brother\u2019s eyes lifted. \u201cNeed to . . . shift . . .\u201d</p><p>Because shifting sped up their healing process.</p><p>\u201cHe went through the window,\u201d Sarah whispered. \u201cHe took out Hayden\u2014they both crashed through and hit the ground.\u201d</p><p>Hayden. That coyote bastard had been there?</p><p>\u201cHell, boy, you\u2019re playin\u2019 hard these days,\u201d Caleb muttered. \u201cJust like your brother.\u201d</p><p>Piers brushed by them, going for the surviving coyote.</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014I thought Jordan was dead,\u201d Sarah said softly.</p><p>Lucas reached for his brother. Jordan\u2019s body was jerking, twisting, but the shift wasn\u2019t coming. Too weak. \u201cHe may be,\u201d he growled and the fury ate his heart. \u201cFucking shift, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>But Jordan\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t glow. His face stayed human. \u201cC-can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his brother\u2019s hand. Held tight. The past flashed before him. Another blood-soaked day. Another shifter who couldn\u2019t change.</p><p>His father had died the same way. Was he just supposed to sit and watch Jordan slip away, too?</p><p>Hayden, you\u2019re dead.</p><p>Sarah brushed against him. She caught Jordan\u2019s chin in her hand and forced him to look at her. \u201cYou saved my life.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes seemed to dim a bit.</p><p>\u201cShift.\u201d She ordered him, the fear and fury in her voice again.</p><p>A ripple shook Jordan\u2019s body. Fur rose along his arms. But he couldn\u2019t change, not all the way.</p><p>\u201cLet the wolf out,\u201d Sarah whispered. \u201cI just need the wolf, for a minute . . .\u201d</p><p>His teeth lengthened. His claws bit into Lucas\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d Sarah whispered, her stare locking on Jordan\u2019s.</p><p>His eyes began to glow.</p><p>\u201cShift.\u201d</p><p>Bones snapped. He shuddered, convulsing. Sarah stumbled back as the beast took shape before them.</p><p>Lucas took a breath. Fuck, yes.</p><p>The shift didn\u2019t last long, but when Jordan\u2019s human form appeared again, his brother wasn\u2019t chalky-white. Some of the deeper wounds had healed.</p><p>He\u2019d live.</p><p>Which was more than he could say for the others.</p><p>He grabbed Sarah\u2019s hand, tugging her close. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Pale, trembling, with blood on her cheeks, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Hayden? Where did the bastard go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know. They went through the window and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one you want . . .\u201d Lucas\u2019s stare drifted back to his brother as Jordan\u2019s lips twisted.</p><p>His gaze slammed right back to Sarah. She swallowed. \u201cI was . . . a bit busy . . .\u201d</p><p>Trying to fight three coyotes? When one slash of their claws could kill her?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stronger than I look,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>So he was learning.</p><p>\u201cThis coyote doesn\u2019t have much time, Lucas!\u201d Piers called out. \u201cJordan blasted one real fine hole in his chest. He lost his beast, and he\u2019s bleeding out fast.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at Piers. Right then, he couldn\u2019t look away from Sarah. Such deep, green eyes.</p><p>Jordan groaned.</p><p>\u201cGet Jordan out of here, Caleb.\u201d Lucas\u2019s head cocked as he studied Sarah. \u201cYou need to go, too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darted back to the coyote shifter. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Whatever I have to do. \u201cYou need to go.\u201d Caleb had already started hauling Jordan out of the room.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes held his a moment longer, then she nodded and turned away, her shoulders hunched. She walked to the door, but glanced back. \u201cI never meant for Jordan to get hurt. Everything happened so fast, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d Because he could hear the ragged tear of the coyote shifter\u2019s breath. Not much longer.</p><p>She went.</p><p>He turned back to Piers and the dying shifter. Three steps and he had the bastard\u2019s neck in his hand. Wild brown eyes met his. \u201cHow much do you want to suffer before you die?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>The man smiled. \u201cThat . . . bitch . . . gonna beg . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s claws dug into skin. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hayden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t . . . won\u2019t . . .\u201d Blood flew from the shifter\u2019s lips.</p><p>Time to skip the preliminaries. \u201cNo time to play,\u201d Lucas muttered and drove his claws in deep.</p><p>The coyote\u2019s screams filled the air. One minute later, he started talking\u2014and two minutes later, he died.</p><p>Sarah stood outside the doorway, her heart slamming into her chest. She wanted to cover her ears. Wanted to run as fast and as far as she could.</p><p>Running hadn\u2019t worked out so well for her, though, so she forced herself to stay. She heard the coyote shifter\u2019s confession. Heard the location of their leader. She knew Hayden would be heading back to lick his wounds. She also knew he\u2019d be meeting up with Rafe.</p><p>After all, Hayden was Rafe\u2019s guard dog. The leash didn\u2019t stretch too far.</p><p>Rafe had sent Hayden after her. Bastard. Rafe would have known that she couldn\u2019t fight the coyotes. He\u2019d wanted her to suffer.</p><p>The shifter\u2019s screams echoed in her ears.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t been hurt. Jordan had. Though that, too, must have been part of Rafe\u2019s plan.</p><p>The dead coyotes wouldn\u2019t matter to Rafe. He\u2019d always thought coyotes were expendable. Weaker physically and intellectually than the wolves, he\u2019d said they hadn\u2019t showed much promise.</p><p>Other than as freaking attack dogs.</p><p>She glanced down at the blood on her fingers. Those coyotes had come too close. If Lucas hadn\u2019t been there . . .</p><p>She would have been the one screaming, then dying.</p><p>Just like the coyote shifter.</p><p>\u201cI told you to go.\u201d Lucas\u2019s low, gravelly voice.</p><p>Sarah straightened fast. \u201cIs he\u2014\u201d Lucas\u2019s gaze held hers. Right. Stupid question. Coyotes didn\u2019t have a healing capacity anywhere close to a wolf\u2019s. Different shifters could heal at different rates. Wolves were some of the strongest, and because of that, they could survive almost anything.</p><p>\u201cYou heard it all?\u201d</p><p>She managed a nod.</p><p>He turned away from her. \u201cJess and his coyote pack were dead when we got there.\u201d</p><p>I killed all the bastards in my way. She tried to speak, couldn\u2019t. Guess who\u2019s the king coyote now? \u201cH-Hayden killed them.\u201d Because he wanted more power, more territory, just like Rafe did.</p><p>No wonder the two had aligned, but did Hayden know that he was as disposable as the others?</p><p>Lucas glanced back at her.</p><p>\u201cHayden told me.\u201d She just hadn\u2019t understood.</p><p>His hands were fisted. \u201cWhat else did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>I did my part.</p><p>\u201cH-he\u2019s working with Rafe.\u201d And if Hayden was there, \u201cRafe\u2019s close.\u201d</p><p>Lucas grabbed her hand and hauled her away from the wall, and he pulled her down the long, twisting corridor and finally, outside, into the clear air where she could breathe and not smell death.</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her go when they made it outside. Just held her hand tighter. She saw the flare of his nostrils. \u201cI\u2019m going after Hayden,\u201d he said, voice grim. \u201cI know where his coyote pack has been hiding.\u201d</p><p>Because Lucas had made the coyote shifter reveal their location before he died. \u201cHayden\u2019s not going to be alone. Didn\u2019t you hear me? Rafe\u2019s close. You can\u2019t just walk in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiers will have my back. The others will stay here with you.\u201d His eyes glittered down at her. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you and Jordan undefended again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go.\u201d Her hand twisted so that she clung tightly to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna sit back and wait for the bastards to come at me again.\u201d His jaw clenched. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve got Dane,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>Her heart seemed to stop. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found his blood at Jess\u2019s, but he wasn\u2019t among the dead. They\u2019ve got him.\u201d</p><p>And Lucas wouldn\u2019t leave a packmate to die. Rafe would be counting on that.</p><p>He\u2019d walk right into a trap. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t go after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t.\u201d Fury had never sounded so cold. \u201cAccording to you, Rafe\u2019s gunning for me. That means he\u2019ll do anything he can to take me down, including hurting my pack.\u201d</p><p>No, Rafe wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill.</p><p>Lucas pulled away and began stalking toward the SUV. \u201cDo you know why he wants you dead so badly?\u201d She called out. Tell him.</p><p>Lucas froze.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about territory.\u201d Not just about wolves being possessive bastards who wanted to control as many people and as much land as possible. She took a deep breath. \u201cWhen you came back to LA, you had to fight to reclaim your pack, didn\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a whole fucking lot left of my pack,\u201d he said, throwing a hard glare over his shoulder. The sunlight caught the savaged edge of his ear. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t come back just for the pack.\u201d</p><p>No, he\u2019d come back for vengeance. She knew the story, thanks to Rafe. \u201cYou came back and killed Kaber.\u201d Kaber Gentry, the lone wolf who\u2019d come into the pack\u2014and killed Lucas\u2019s father. Then attacked a ten-year-old boy. She knew exactly how Lucas had gotten that torn ear. Kaber had bit off part of Lucas\u2019s ear when the two fought. Kaber hadn\u2019t exactly believed in showing mercy to a child.</p><p>To anyone.</p> <p>Lucas growled, \u201cThe fucking bastard deserved everything he got.\u201d</p><p>And Kaber had gotten a lot of pain. The final battle between Kaber and Lucas had lasted for hours and ended with Kaber missing more than just half an ear. Lucas had taken his head.</p><p>\u201cYou went after him because he killed your father.\u201d She sucked in a quick breath. \u201cThat\u2019s why Rafe is coming after you.\u201d</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change. Not by so much as a flicker of his eyelashes. \u201cKaber Gentry had no sons. No daughters. He was Lone, a wolf that had been kicked out of his pack because he was fucking psychotic.\u201d</p><p>She was aware of the door opening behind her. Sarah looked back and found Piers gazing at them with a shuttered stare. She remembered the touch of his mind. The chaos inside. Psychotic. She cleared her throat. \u201cLone or not, he took the pack from your father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe destroyed the damn pack!\u201d Lucas came back to her, fast. \u201cHe turned \u2019em into killers. They hunted humans, attacked at will, made a bloodbath\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mated with a human, and they had a son. Kaber didn\u2019t think the boy could shift, so he left them behind.\u201d His mistake. His hybrid son could definitely shift into the form of a wolf.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you saying? That Rafe is coming after me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he wants your land, and your pack, just like his father did.\u201d She lifted her chin. \u201cBut more than that, he wants revenge, and he\u2019s not going to stop until he gets his pound of flesh from you.\u201d</p><p>His broad shoulders seemed to block the light. \u201cI\u2019m not giving his family any more flesh.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let her gaze drift to his ear. She never had. \u201cIf you give him the chance, he\u2019ll take it. He\u2019s going after everything you care about. Everyone.\u201d</p> <p>He caught her arms and yanked her against his chest. \u201cThe whole time, you knew it was personal.\u201d His breath feathered over her face. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always personal,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that?\u201d No kill in the Other world was ever just business.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you don\u2019t know about me?\u201d he muttered, gaze hard on her face.</p><p>She knew the big details . . .</p><p>The battle when he\u2019d been a child.</p><p>The fight to take his pack back.</p><p>The hunt for the vampires.</p><p>But there was still so much she didn\u2019t know. Sure, she knew the blood and gore parts. Nothing about the man. \u201cA lot,\u201d she managed to whisper, but she was trying to know everything, struggling to learn as much as she could.</p> <p>\u201cLucas!\u201d Caleb\u2019s voice cut through the air.</p><p>They glanced back. He stood just behind Piers.</p><p>\u201cDane\u2019s on the line.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSounds damn weak . . . and he said\u2014he said he had to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Dane. Sarah\u2019s shoulders sagged. If he was calling back to base, then he was safe.</p><p>They rushed back toward the house. Caleb tossed Lucas the cell phone.</p><p>\u201cDane, where the hell are\u2014\u201d Lucas began, but he broke off, eyes narrowing. \u201cWho the fuck is this?\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps rose on her arms and she knew even before Lucas snarled, \u201cRafe.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Low laughter filled Lucas\u2019s ears. \u201cI\u2019ve got something you want.\u201d</p><p>He almost shattered the cell phone. \u201cPut Dane on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no can do. But your boy heard him\u2014he knows I\u2019ve got the lost wolf.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something you want,\u201d Rafe said again, his voice light, mocking, \u201cbut . . .\u201d And now his voice changed. Grew harder. Angrier. \u201cYou\u2019ve got something I fucking need.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s stare jumped to Sarah. She watched him with wide eyes, biting her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cPretty isn\u2019t she?\u201d Rafe murmured. \u201cBut be careful, her looks are deceiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d His promise.</p><p>More laughter. \u201cNo, but unless I get what I need, Dane will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making a trade with you.\u201d Pale flesh scarred with clawmarks. \u201cSo fuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how Dane got all those marks on his body.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s back teeth clenched so hard his jaw ached.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be adding a few more,\u201d Rafe told him. \u201cYou have an hour to make the trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I even know where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you. You made the coyotes talk before you killed them.\u201d A brief pause. \u201cIt\u2019s what I would\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Now the bastard thought Lucas was like him? \u201cYou\u2019re not getting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a dumbass.\u201d Disdain now, no, disgust. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her, and you\u2019d be a fool to trust her.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s gaze still held his.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Simone? You think you can fuck her?\u201d Rafe\u2019s breath rasped over the line. \u201cYou can\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t let you touch her. Wouldn\u2019t let anyone but me come close.\u201d Absolute confidence.</p><p>Think again. But he bit back the words. They\u2019d just piss off Rafe, and he didn\u2019t want the bastard taking out his rage on Dane.</p><p>\u201cOne hour,\u201d Rafe said again. \u201cBring her. Bring two men as backup. We switch, and you walk away clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you kill her?\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s body tensed.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t kill Sarah.\u201d Surprise there. \u201cHasn\u2019t she told you? I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can slash her, can\u2019t you, asshole? Can dig those claws into her and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck do you know?\u201d</p><p>Because I saw her. Every damn inch. Touched and tasted.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Sarah came closer, her footsteps silent. She touched his hand. \u201cMake the trade,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His breath caught in his throat.</p><p>\u201cMake it, or he dies.\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice was stronger, but fear showed in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d Rafe\u2019s low growl. Hungry, almost desperate. \u201cSee, she wants to come back to me.\u201d</p><p>Like hell.</p><p>\u201cTwo men come with you,\u201d Rafe said again. \u201cYou stay in human form, and you bring Sarah to me.\u201d</p><p>The wind lifted her hair, tossing it lightly against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t get my mate back, then you\u2019ll get your wolf in pieces. Very, very small pieces.\u201d</p><p>The line died.</p><p>At first, Lucas didn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t. Rage pumped through his body. A fury that was all too familiar.</p><p>The fury he\u2019d felt when his father died . . .</p><p>When Kaber had defeated him so easily and tossed his broken body into the dirt . . .</p><p>When the vamps took Jordan . . . When he\u2019d tracked the scent of his brother\u2019s blood to that hellhole in Vegas . . .</p><p>My mate.</p><p>Sarah licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d Caleb asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look away from Sarah. He heard a crunch and realized he\u2019d crushed the phone. \u201cGet ready,\u201d he said to Caleb. \u201cYou and Piers are coming with me.\u201d Michael would stay and protect the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get Dane back.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell. Lucas caught her chin and forced her stare back to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been holding out on me.\u201d He barely bit out the words. His claws wanted to burst from his skin. His teeth were burning, lengthening.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s footsteps thundered away. Lucas took Sarah\u2019s hand and pulled her around the side of the house. He pressed her against the rough brick walls.</p><p>\u201cI-I know . . . there\u2019s no choice . . . you have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth took hers in a hot, hard kiss, swallowing the words. She gasped against his lips, and he took her breath, too. Took everything.</p><p>The kiss wasn\u2019t gentle. Wasn\u2019t easy. He was way past that point. The blood pounded in his veins, and he heard the bastard\u2019s voice echoing in his mind.</p><p>His mouth wrenched away from hers. \u201cWhy the hell . . .\u201d He sucked in a breath, tasted her. Wanted more. Needed more. Just like that bastard Rafe seemed to need her. \u201cDoes that asshole think you\u2019re his mate?\u201d</p><p>Sarah flinched. \u201cYou know . . . you know we were lovers, I told you that.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and how the hell that had happened, he didn\u2019t know. \u201cWhat is it, babe? You got a thing for badasses?\u201d First Rafe.</p><p>Now me.</p><p>She pressed back harder against the wall, as if she were trying to put space between them. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t like . . . that at first.\u201d The words came slowly. \u201cHe understood me, made me feel like I fit in. Finally, I fit someplace. I was wanted.\u201d</p><p>Still was wanted. The guy was willing to kill in order to get her back\u2014and Lucas was ready to kill to keep her. After only a few days . . .</p><p>Her lashes lowered. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize he was playing me until it was too late. I\u2019d already slept with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times?\u201d</p><p>Her lashes flew back up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t want to know. Don\u2019t want to think about\u2014\u201cHow many fucking times did you screw him?\u201d</p><p>She shoved against him. \u201cNone of your damn business!\u201d</p><p>Yeah, it is. His hands curled around her shoulders. \u201cHe thinks you\u2019re his mate.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth popped open in shock. \u201cWhat? No, no, he just wants to kill me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called you his mate.\u201d A wolf wouldn\u2019t make a mistake like that.</p><p>\u201cThen he was lying or jerking you around or\u2014\u201d She broke off, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m not his mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters know their mates.\u201d Not some predestined our-souls-are-meant-as-one bullshit. He didn\u2019t buy that crap. But shifters could recognize those who were the best compatible genetic matches. Survival of the fucking fittest. Not everyone could produce a shifter\u2019s offspring. It took a real special match, or else the world would have been exploding with shifters by now.</p><p>Some shifters recognized their mates by scent. An instinctive reaction. Some recognized them during the sex act\u2014couldn\u2019t get more instinctive than that.</p><p>\u201cHow many times?\u201d he gritted again.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you, okay? Like I said, that\u2019s none of your business!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, your ex-lover is gunning for my pack, he says he\u2019s mated to you, that I can\u2019t trust you\u2014\u201d</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been watching so closely, he might have missed that small widening of her eyes. But he had been watching her. Very closely.</p><p>Can\u2019t trust you, can I?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what he thinks,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not his mate. I\u2019m not planning to spend the rest of my life\u2014however long or short that may be\u2014with him. We\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight you are.\u201d His hand dove into the thickness of her hair. He caught the nape of her neck and pulled her closer.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to kill me,\u201d she told him, voice husky. \u201cIsn\u2019t that proof enough that we\u2019re not mated? Would a shifter kill his mate?\u201d</p><p>It had happened before. Too many times. The animal was too close and jealousy was a primal emotion. An emotion that had roused his own beast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not turning you over to him.\u201d Their mouths were so close. He could already taste her.</p><p>And since they were so close, there was no missing the flash of sadness in her eyes. \u201cYes, you are.\u201d She kissed him then. A light, open-mouthed kiss that just stirred the animal all the more. \u201cBecause there isn\u2019t a choice.\u201d</p><p>Screw that. His lips took hers. Hard. Wild. He thrust his tongue inside her mouth, tasted her deep and long because that was what he needed.</p><p>There was always a choice. He might not like the options but . . . there was always a choice.</p><p>His cock shoved against the front of his jeans. Rage and lust fired his blood. She was all he could feel. All he could smell. Everything he needed right then.</p><p>His left hand snaked between them. He found the soft curve of her breast. The nipple was hard, already pebbled against his fingers, and the scent of her arousal deepened around him.</p><p>Aroused, yes, but . . . afraid?</p><p>His head shot up. No way to do slow and easy now. They were outside. Time was against them, but . . .</p><p>Fucking need her.</p><p>Because death pressed close. He could feel the cold bastard all around him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me,\u201d he said deliberately, \u201csay it now.\u201d Because five more seconds . . .</p><p>She blinked. He didn\u2019t see the fear in her eyes then. Did she know that his canines were growing? She had to see the beast\u2019s glow in his eyes.</p><p>But her hands went to the waist of his jeans. She jerked open the snap, slid down the zipper. Hell, yes.</p><p>Right then, right there. Death could wait. He was taking life then.</p><p>Her fingers curled around his cock. Cool, silken hands that tightened as they pumped and worked his flesh. Long, sensual strokes from root to tip. Strokes that had his body tensing as the need built and the lust just burned hotter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A snarl broke from his lips. Can\u2019t . . . control . . .</p><p>He yanked open her jeans. Shoved them to the ground. Tore away her panties. She stumbled, trying to kick out of her jeans. He caught her, lifted her up high in his arms, and pushed her back against the wall.</p><p>He held her up easily. Her legs were parted, open to him, as they cradled his hips. No fear flickered in her eyes. That green seemed so deep. Then she whispered his name.</p> <p>His cock shoved into her, a long, driving thrust that left them both gasping. Her legs pressed against his hips, her sex clamped around him\u2014tight, hot, wet and\u2014</p><p>No condom.</p><p>Lucas froze.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s breath heaved out and her nails dug into his shoulders. \u201cLucas.\u201d</p><p>His teeth clenched. Thrust. The command was snarled from inside, but he didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou . . . protected?\u201d</p> <p>A thin line appeared between her eyes. Her hips arched against him. \u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thrust. \u201cI\u2019m clean.\u201d A shifter\u2019s natural healing ability protected him from just about every disease or illness out there.</p><p>Her delicate, inner muscles squeezed him. \u201cMe too, don\u2019t worry\u2014\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d only be able to get her pregnant if she were his mate. If she was . . .</p><p>He withdrew.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered and broke his control.</p> <p>Lucas drove balls-deep into her, again and again. His hands dug into her hips as he held her tighter, positioning her so that he could plunge deeper into her creamy warmth. Deeper, harder, and with every thrust, she welcomed him with her hot, wet sex, holding tight, so fucking tight.</p><p>The base of his spine taunted as the need mounted. Harder, deeper. The sound of her gasps filled his ears. Her body slickened more for him, the flesh plumping as she strained against him.</p><p>Harder, deeper. Not him this time . . . that was her whispered command.</p><p>And he gave the lady just what she wanted.</p><p>His mouth took hers, his tongue drove deep, and she came around his cock. A wild squeeze that had his own climax erupting. He came inside her on a long, shuddering wave of pleasure that racked his body.</p><p>When the haze cleared from his eyes, Lucas realized that he had Sarah pinned to the wall. Her body seemed limp against his, her hands now light on his shoulders.</p><p>Carefully, he pulled away from her, a slow glide of his flesh, but she gasped at that friction. His gaze flew to hers. He didn\u2019t see pain or fear in her stare. Just a little flash of pleasure.</p><p>Sarah.</p> <p>The lady was much stronger than she looked. She\u2019d be able to take all that he could give her. He had plans to give her one hell of a lot.</p><p>He eased her legs down. When her knees trembled, he steadied her, and helped her to right her clothes. Her lips were dark, her cheeks flushed, her eyes glittering. Sexy enough to tempt the devil.</p><p>Want her again.</p><p>He yanked up his jeans. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have . . .\u201d Oh, fuck that. He\u2019d done just what he wanted. Lucas cleared his throat. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>A slow nod. \u201cBetter than okay.\u201d She smiled at him, a ghost of a smile that lifted her lips and chased a few of the shadows from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d he told her quietly, his gaze raking her. \u201cI taste every inch of you.\u201d The words were a promise.</p><p>Her smile dimmed. \u201cYou sure there\u2019ll be a next time?\u201d She brushed by him, heading back toward the blood and the scent of death.</p><p>\u201cCount on it.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him. \u201cYou sound awful sure of yourself. Especially when we\u2019ve got the devil pounding at the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him pound,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the asshole.\u201d He looked forward to going fang-to-claw with the bastard.</p><p>Sarah turned away and hurried inside. \u201cI wish I could say the same thing.\u201d Her whisper drifted back on the wind.</p><p>His gaze slid to the left. To the rolling hills and the trees that bordered his land. So many places to hide. So many places to watch.</p><p>Lucas let a smile curve his lips as he stared at the hills. My mate. Hell, no, she wasn\u2019t Rafe\u2019s.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let you touch her. Wouldn\u2019t let anyone but me come close.</p><p>\u201cWrong again, asshole,\u201d he murmured and turned slowly toward the house. When he went to kill Rafe, Sarah\u2019s scent would be on his body. And when Rafe died, Lucas would make sure he was the last sight the bastard ever saw.</p><p>The binoculars shattered in Rafe\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get out of here,\u201d Hayden said, voice shaking with nerves and pain.</p><p>Rafe didn\u2019t look at the coyote. They\u2019d met at their rendezvous point, just like they\u2019d planned. With one not-so-minor glitch. No Sarah.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have Sarah because she was busy fucking Lucas Simone. He threw the shattered remains to the ground and jumped back inside the jeep.</p><p>Hayden groaned next to him. The scent of the coyote\u2019s blood was growing stronger. The guy had barely dragged himself out of the battle. Guess the stories about the younger wolf were true. Jordan wouldn\u2019t be as easy to kill as they\u2019d thought. Good.</p><p>\u201cHe . . . bringing her?\u201d Hayden rasped.</p><p>Rafe slammed his foot on the gas and the jeep lunged forward. He glanced to the right and saw that blood had trickled from Hayden\u2019s nose. \u201cHe\u2019ll bring her.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t really be the wolf\u2019s choice. The deal hadn\u2019t been for Lucas. It had been for Sarah.</p><p>Because he knew all of her weak points, too. Knew them very, very well. Deep inside, Sarah was soft. Pity. If she\u2019d been harder . . .</p><p>But, no, she\u2019d showed her true colors. \u201cSarah won\u2019t leave Dane to die.\u201d Even if Lucas would. \u201cShe\u2019ll come with him or she\u2019ll sneak away and come on her own. Either way . . .\u201d His fingers tightened around the wheel. She\u2019d let him fuck her. \u201cEither way, we\u2019ll have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lucas?\u201d</p><p>His claws burst through his fingertips. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting years for that bastard to beg.\u201d The time for waiting was over. \u201cSimone and his brother\u2014and any wolf who stands with him\u2014will die.\u201d He\u2019d make sure that death was as painful as possible. After all, that\u2019s just what Lucas had done to his father, he\u2019d made sure Kaber suffered.</p><p>Blood for blood.</p><p>Get ready to beg, Simone.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to trade her?\u201d Sarah held her breath when she heard Caleb\u2019s voice. She couldn\u2019t see the wolves, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d came Lucas\u2019s instant response. His feet thudded on the floor. \u201cHow\u2019s Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill out.\u201d A sigh. Had to be from Caleb. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be all right, though. Dane\u2019s the one we need to worry about. We can\u2019t just leave him. You know what happened before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Growled.</p><p>Sarah turned away from the room and tried to creep quietly away. Probably didn\u2019t matter how quiet she was, though, the wolves would know she was in the hall. She\u2019d just wanted to peek at Jordan before she left, but there was no chance for that now.</p><p>He\u2019d almost died for her. When she\u2019d first planned to come after Lucas, she hadn\u2019t thought about the risks she\u2019d bring to his pack. She\u2019d just thought\u2014</p><p>Hell. About myself.</p><p>Jordan had nearly died, and if she didn\u2019t do something, Dane would die.</p><p>The weight of her knife seemed to burn her ankle. She\u2019d taken the liberty of retrieving her knife from Lucas\u2019s room moments before. She\u2019d changed her clothes, tried to ignore the imprint of Lucas\u2019s body on hers, and gotten her weapon back. Because there was no way she\u2019d face Rafe unarmed.</p><p>And I am facing him.</p><p>Too many bodies were piling up. If Lucas wouldn\u2019t make the trade, she\u2019d make it herself.</p><p>Sarah slipped through the open front door, and ran for the SUV. No wolves were out there, and no one called out to stop her.</p><p>Fate was finally on her side. The keys were still inside the vehicle. The wolves must have been too distracted when they pulled up, and they\u2019d forgotten to take the keys out. Their mistake.</p><p>She hopped inside. She\u2019d heard enough from the coyote during that brutal pre-death interrogation. She knew where to go. And if she could just get close enough to Rafe . . .</p><p>This time, I won\u2019t miss your heart.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s head snapped toward the window when he heard the growl of the engine. Piers wouldn\u2019t go to the meeting without him\u2014</p><p>He lunged for the window, saw the flash of red tail-lights, and knew. \u201cSarah!\u201d</p><p>Going after the bastard.</p><p>Lucas spun around and almost slammed into Caleb.</p><p>\u201cWait, Lucas, what\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to say more. Lucas shoved past the other shifter and bounded down the stairs. She\u2019d left. Gone out on her own.</p><p>\u201cDammit, I\u2019m comin\u2019 with you!\u201d Caleb yelled.</p><p>Piers stepped from the kitchen, blocking his way. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t slow down, he just pushed the wolf out of his way. \u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t you stop her?\u201d Piers had been downstairs. He would have caught her scent, heard Sarah as she fled.</p><p>\u201cBecause someone needed to make the trade.\u201d</p><p>Lucas froze and fired a deadly stare over his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s not your call to make.\u201d</p><p>Piers swallowed, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing. \u201cIt was hers. She made the call. I just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her walk to her own death.\u201d He wanted to rip Piers apart. Piers had been his friend for years, but right then, he wanted to hurt the bastard. \u201cIf she dies . . .\u201d So do you. The words wanted to come, but he bit them back.</p><p>Piers\u2019s lips parted in surprise. Yeah, the wolf understood.</p><p>Wasting time. He whirled around and raced for the other SUV. Sarah must have overheard the location of the drop site. He\u2019d been aware of her while he questioned the coyote. Her scent had been strong, too strong\u2014because she was close.</p><p>He jumped into the SUV and gunned the engine. Piers and Caleb were right with him.</p><p>\u201cMichael will guard Jordan,\u201d Caleb told him. \u201cHe saw us go, he\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas spun out of the graveled drive. She came to me for help, so why is she running back to the bastard now?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Caleb asked from the backseat. \u201cI mean, our first priority is Dane, right? He\u2019s pack, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas spared him a glance in the rearview mirror. \u201cThe plan is that we get Dane back, we get Sarah, and we kill Rafe.\u201d Simple enough to him.</p><p>\u201cWe should bring more men,\u201d Piers growled.</p><p>\u201cThe deal was I bring two men.\u201d His fingers whitened around the wheel. \u201cI bring two men. He gets Sarah, I get Dane.\u201d Only Lucas planned to get them both. \u201cIf he catches the scent of more than two . . .\u201d The bastard might kill Dane.</p><p>Silence. They all knew what could happen.</p><p>The SUV hit one hundred and ten miles per hour as it flew down the winding road.</p><p>\u201cDo you really trust her?\u201d Caleb asked quietly. \u201cWhat if this is just part of a setup?\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>But Caleb kept pushing. \u201cIf you find out that she\u2019s tricking you, what will you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas would do anything to protect the pack,\u201d Piers snapped, voice gruff. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Would he? He\u2019d spent so many years fighting for the pack\u2014maybe it was time he got something for himself. Someone. Sarah.</p><p>If Rafe had touched her, he\u2019d tear the bastard\u2019s fingers right off his hand.</p><p>The warehouse was boarded up, the windows covered, the main entrance blocked with a thick chain. Sarah climbed out of the vehicle, her movements slow, too stiff. She could feel eyes on her, watching her every move. She lifted her hands up high. \u201cI\u2019m not armed!\u201d She could lie, too.</p><p>No one called back to her.</p><p>Sarah glanced around. All the buildings on this stretch of road had been abandoned. One looked like it had barely survived a blaze. Two others were boarded up, just like the warehouse. She caught the furtive stare of a homeless man and heard the squeak of rats.</p><p>But didn\u2019t hear the voice of a wolf shifter.</p><p>Sarah crept away from the SUV. \u201cI\u2019m here! Isn\u2019t that what you wanted? Dammit, Rafe, I know you\u2019re watching! Isn\u2019t this what you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Sarah.\u201d He said her name softly, and she spun around. He stood less than five feet away, dark hair tousled, one brow raised, and his lips twisted in that familiar smile.</p><p>\u201cRafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at the endearment. Rafe sidled closer, that smile still on his lips. His face was deceptively handsome\u2014strong angles, high cheeks, a square jaw. And his body was still as strong and powerful as ever. \u201cWh-where\u2019s Dane?\u201d she demanded, her gaze trying to search the growing shadows. \u201cI\u2019m here, so let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stood less than a foot away now, staring at her, his nostrils flaring.</p><p>Oh, shit. That damn keen wolf sense of smell. He\u2019d know\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have fucked him, Sarah.\u201d His brown eyes slit.</p><p>An engine roared. Her head swung to the side and she saw another dark SUV hurtle down the road. Lucas.</p><p>Rafe\u2019s fingers locked around her throat. Her heart froze as he leaned in close to her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to kill him,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Lucas leapt from the vehicle, with Piers and Caleb at his heels. \u201cSarah!\u201d Lucas charged forward, his eyes already lit with the glow of the beast. His claws were out, up, ready to rip and tear. \u201cGet the fuck away from her, Santiago!\u201d</p><p>But Rafe just pulled her closer. He spun her, so that her back was pressed to his chest and his hand still circled her throat. \u201cSarah\u2019s used to having me near her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas snarled and charged at them.</p><p>Rafe\u2019s claws cut into her skin. \u201cAnother step and I\u2019ll cut her throat wide open.\u201d A rough laugh. \u201cShe won\u2019t be any use to either of us then, will she? So I\u2019d suggest you stand down!\u201d</p><p>Lucas threw out his hand and caught Piers just as the guy ran by him. Caleb waited a few paces behind them. All three men seemed to vibrate with fury.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dane?\u201d Lucas\u2019s hands were at his sides.</p><p>\u201cAll in good time.\u201d Rafe\u2019s muscles were rock-hard behind her. \u201cYou only brought two men. Good.\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cYou know I could kill her before you so much as touched me, don\u2019t you, Alpha?\u201d Now Rafe was taunting. \u201cCharmers are no different than humans. One slice\u2014and she\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t looking at her. The fury of his stare was directed fully at Rafe.</p> <p>\u201cYou fucked my mate, Simone,\u201d Rafe snarled, \u201cand that really, really pisses me off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your\u2014\u201d Sarah began but his claws dug deeper and her words ended in a gasp.</p><p>Lucas looked at her then, burned her with his blazing blue eyes. There was death in those eyes. The savage promise of hell coming. \u201cShe\u2019s not yours,\u201d Lucas told him, his voice quiet, a hard contrast to the fury of his stare.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s yours?\u201d Laughter. \u201cShe\u2019s playing you, the same way she played me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. \u201cLucas\u2014\u201d Damn, those claws hurt.</p><p>One hand smoothed back her hair. \u201cDid you tell him, sweetheart? Does he know about your little secrets?\u201d</p> <p>No, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Lucas was still looking at her, and she knew he\u2019d seen the flicker of her eyelashes. Too telling for someone as observant as he was.</p><p>\u201cDid you really think she was just some innocent charmer who\u2019d stumbled into your path?\u201d</p><p>No one\u2019s innocent.</p><p>Sarah licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cShe killed a cop last night,\u201d Rafe murmured. \u201cBut her face hasn\u2019t been splashed all over the TV. In fact, no reports of that cop bastard dying have even made the news.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced back at Rafe.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d Rafe asked.</p> <p>Lucas kept his hands at his sides. Caleb stalked closer to him.</p><p>\u201cDid you even wonder why the story didn\u2019t spread like fucking fire?\u201d Rafe hauled her closer. \u201cI bet Sarah knows why she\u2019s safe from scrutiny. I bet she knows why the cops aren\u2019t chasing her, why they have never chased her.\u201d</p><p>Her body trembled. She hadn\u2019t expected this. She\u2019d thought Rafe would fight her, that Dane would escape. Why is he doing this?</p><p>What had he told her about Lucas? I\u2019m not going to kill him. Then what was his plan?</p><p>\u201cYou fucked her, and you may have trusted her.\u201d Rafe\u2019s fingers tightened on her throat. \u201cI made the same mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d Finally, Lucas spoke.</p><p>She felt Rafe tense. \u201cDo you know what she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA charmer.\u201d</p><p>True enough.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all,\u201d Rafe told him, voice cutting like the claws on her neck. \u201cShe came to me for a reason, came to you\u2014for the same damn reason.\u201d</p><p>Now he was hitting too close to the truth.</p><p>\u201cThe cops aren\u2019t after her,\u201d Rafe said, \u201cbecause she\u2019s got someone covering her back.\u201d</p><p>Sarah tried to crane her neck away from those claws.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a chance, Simone.\u201d She knew Rafe was bullshitting. He wouldn\u2019t really give Lucas anything. \u201cYou can walk away from her. Go back to your pack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dane?\u201d Piers wanted to know.</p><p>Rafe didn\u2019t acknowledge him. \u201cYou can go back, leave her with me, and life can just . . . go on.\u201d</p><p>Everyone else\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving her,\u201d Lucas told him.</p><p>If claws hadn\u2019t been digging into her skin, she would have relaxed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here to destroy me.\u201d Rafe was adamant on that. He was also right.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas smiled now. \u201cI\u2019m here to do that, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Thin trickles of blood ran down Sarah\u2019s throat, and the sight had rage boiling within Lucas. \u201cLet her go,\u201d he snapped, the beast inside howling for freedom.</p><p>Rafe narrowed his eyes. \u201cDid Sarah tell you why she first came to me?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t want to know. His nostrils twitched. He couldn\u2019t detect Dane\u2019s scent. There were coyotes around, close, hiding in the shadows, and the thick odor of blood hung in the air, but\u2014no Dane.</p><p>\u201cI thought she was innocent the first time I met her, too, then I found out the truth.\u201d Rafe\u2019s mouth was too close to Sarah\u2019s ear.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s head twisted to the side. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s FBI, Alpha. She came into my pack, seduced me, used me, because her mission was to take down my wolves.\u201d</p><p>What? Lucas\u2019s gaze flew back to Sarah.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mention that, did she?\u201d</p><p>Hell, no, she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the bait they used, to get into the pack. To get to me.\u201d Rafe\u2019s lips curled back in a snarl. \u201cTo get to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d Lucas said her name flatly, not letting the fury tightening his gut to be voiced. \u201cIs he lying?\u201d</p><p>He saw her throat work as she swallowed, a delicate movement against the claws. \u201cNo,\u201d she murmured and her lashes lowered. Then . . . \u201cHe\u2019s not lying. I-I was with the FBI.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in his body locked. He knew there was a division in the FBI that followed Other. A division that even had a so-called \u201cextermination list\u201d for the paranormals that the Bureau felt should be put down.</p><p>He\u2019d known about that group, but he just hadn\u2019t particularly given a damn about them. Until now.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t trust her,\u201d Rafe murmured, and his hold eased a bit as a satisfied smirk curled his lips. \u201cBait, that\u2019s all she is.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she get those scars on her back?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>That smirk slipped away. \u201cI found out who she really was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . was that before or after she went for your heart with her silver knife?\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s teeth snapped together. The light dimmed more as dusk swept toward them. \u201cShe told you about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me a lot of things.\u201d Like the fact that you want me dead because I took out your asshole of a father.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe her.\u201d The claws lifted a bit, but they were still killing-close. \u201cShe\u2019s good at lying.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d figured that out. So when Sarah said she worked for the FBI, was that a lie? Or the truth? \u201cIf she\u2019s such a damn liar, why the hell do you want her back so badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s mine.\u201d Rafe spoke the words in a tone that said the answer should be obvious.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s head slammed into his. Rafe swore and blood spurted from his nose. He stumbled back, and she tore free as the claws raked across her flesh. \u201cNo,\u201d Sarah shouted, \u201cI\u2019m not yours!\u201d</p><p>Around him, Lucas heard the howl of the coyotes. So they were finally coming out to play. The waning sunlight bled across the sky. The sky wouldn\u2019t be the only place filled with blood soon.</p><p>Bones crunched behind him. Caleb would be shifting, getting ready to attack. Lucas would change, too. The better to rip Rafe\u2019s throat right out.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sarah\u2019s scream. \u201cDon\u2019t shift, Lucas!\u201d</p><p>His muscles locked, and he fought the change. Sweat broke over his body as he held back the beast.</p><p>Rafe laughed as the blood poured from his nose. \u201cToo late,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Lucas leapt forward and caught the bastard around the throat. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dane?\u201d</p><p>Rafe spat blood. \u201cHow the fuck should I know?\u201d</p><p>Now that he hadn\u2019t expected.</p><p>Rafe started laughing then, loud, wild laughter. \u201cSo fucking easy. And here I thought you\u2019d be a challenge to take down.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lifted the bastard up, letting Rafe\u2019s feet dangle above the ground. \u201cDane.\u201d The coyotes were closing in. Piers was shifting, the man disappearing as the wolf howled and broke free of his leash.</p><p>Rafe\u2019s laughter slowly faded. The guy could have broken away. Could have shifted. But he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLucas . . .\u201d Sarah grabbed his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck is he?\u201d Lucas shook Rafe.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d He smiled, and the blood smeared his teeth. \u201cI never had the asshole.\u201d</p><p>But, wait, no, he\u2019d wanted a trade. Caleb had said\u2014</p><p>Howls filled the air. Lower, harder cries from the two wolves behind him, and the higher-pitched howls from the swarming coyotes.</p><p>Then a bus hit Lucas, slamming him to the ground as Sarah screamed.</p><p>No, not a bus. He\u2019d been taken down by . . . a wolf.</p><p>Dane knew there was trouble at the wolf compound long before the big house came into sight. The scent of fresh blood hung in the air, a silent call to his beast.</p><p>He stayed low, going in carefully when he wanted to run flat-out and storm the place.</p><p>Quiet. The whole damn area was too quiet. And the lingering scent of coyote teased his nose.</p><p>Not those bastards again.</p><p>He pressed a hand to his side. Most of his wounds had healed. Most. He needed to shift again, but wouldn\u2019t, not until he found out what the hell was going on.</p><p>\u201cDane?\u201d Michael\u2019s shocked voice.</p><p>Next to Dane, Michael\u2019s nose was the strongest of the pack. Dane gave up the shadows and charged forward.</p><p>Michael shook his head, his brows high above his dark eyes. \u201cThey got you back already? But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot me back? Wait, you knew the coyotes had me?\u201d</p><p>Michael came away from the doorway with slow, measured strides. \u201cThe coyotes . . . they\u2019re working with Rafe. He was going to trade you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe? That bastard hasn\u2019t been anywhere near me.\u201d Just coyotes. Dead coyotes.</p><p>\u201c\u2014for Sarah,\u201d Michael finished.</p><p>A fist punched Dane in the gut. \u201cI wasn\u2019t part of any damn trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . Caleb heard your voice. You were with Rafe. The bastard said he\u2019d kill you if Sarah wasn\u2019t brought in as a trade.\u201d</p><p>The compound was tomb-silent. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lucas?\u201d But he already knew.</p><p>\u201cGone to make the trade.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cThere was no fucking trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s snarl stopped him. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d Lucas was walking right into a trap. Dammit, a trap. For me.</p><p>Michael\u2019s gaze swept down his body. \u201cWhy do I smell human blood on you?\u201d Suspicion had him tensing.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about her. \u201cCaleb never heard my voice. If he said he did, he was . . .\u201d Lying. No, Caleb was pack. He wouldn\u2019t lie. \u201cMistaken.\u201d And shit, they didn\u2019t have time to kill. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonclave and Grant. Sarah went first, she took one of the SUVs and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dane turned away and ran back toward the van he\u2019d stolen a few hours before. Hold on, Lucas. I\u2019m coming to cover your back.</p><p>He owed the alpha everything, and he damn sure wouldn\u2019t stand back while Lucas was slaughtered.</p><p>Mistake . . . or fucking lie?</p><p>Lucas spun around and barely caught the muzzle that came at him. The wolf\u2019s teeth were dripping saliva, the beast ready to bite, to rip him open. And the damn bastard was one of his own.</p><p>Caleb.</p><p>\u201cGuess Sarah didn\u2019t tell you about her other talents.\u201d Rafe\u2019s voice drifted in the air.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s claws dug into Lucas\u2019s chest.</p><p>A wolf\u2019s snarl of fury reached his ears. Piers. Lucas craned his head, just a bit, that was all he could manage. Piers stood in front of Sarah, his back up, his teeth snapping. Attacking her?</p><p>\u201cStand down!\u201d Lucas roared.</p><p>But Piers didn\u2019t move. Lucas could barely see him and Sarah. Caleb\u2019s body blocked his line of sight.</p><p>\u201cGood job, Sarah,\u201d Rafe told her, his voice oozing satisfaction. Lucas clamped down tighter on Caleb\u2019s muzzle. The bastard had almost bitten his fingers with that head twist. \u201cYou did real good with him.\u201d</p><p>Betrayal burned in Lucas\u2019s gut.</p><p>Rafe crouched close to Lucas. Not too close. Out of grabbing reach. \u201cShe can\u2019t just read the minds of wolves, you know.\u201d He said the words like he was revealing a big secret. Maybe he was.</p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d</p><p>Caleb jerked his muzzle free. He came in for a bite\u2014</p><p>Lucas shoved his forearm between the wolf\u2019s teeth. When Caleb bit down, sinking his teeth through muscle and bone, Lucas didn\u2019t make a sound. Betrayal. From my own damn pack. Like this was the first time.</p><p>\u201cShe can control the wolves, too,\u201d Rafe murmured. \u201cIn wolf form, your men are helpless against her. Whatever she thinks, whatever she wants, they\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Shock froze him for a moment.</p><p>Caleb jumped back, then came in for another bite\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sarah\u2019s scream. Rage and terror. \u201cLeave him alone! Don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>The change swept over Lucas then. Uncontrollable. Instinctive.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes . . .\u201d Rafe said. \u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shoved his claws into Caleb\u2019s chest. The wolf bursting from within gave him power, and he lifted Caleb, tossing the wolf into the air and right at Rafe.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Rafe scrambled back, too late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas\u2019s hands hit the ground. His fingers curved. His back arched as the bones snapped. Fur burst over his skin.</p><p>\u201cNo, Lucas! That\u2019s when you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>His head rose and he saw Sarah. The coyotes had surrounded her and Piers. Piers was trying to hold them off, trying to protect her, and Sarah was swiping out with a knife. But she\u2019d turned away from the coyotes, turned to shout to him\u2014</p> <p>And a coyote caught her, locking his teeth around her arm and the knife clattered to the ground as she stumbled.</p><p>No!</p><p>A soft snick reached his ears. His head whipped back around. Rafe smiled at him. The asshole stood less than two feet away, and his right hand curled around a gun\u2014a gun that was aimed straight at Lucas.</p><p>\u201cI think what Sarah was trying to say . . .\u201d Rafe began.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s body bucked, his hands vanished, paws appeared.</p> <p>\u201c. . . is that you\u2019re helpless when you change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d Sarah\u2019s scream of pain and fury.</p><p>\u201cThe bullet\u2019s made of silver, Simone.\u201d Rafe pointed the gun at Lucas\u2019s head. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no way I\u2019m missing when I\u2019m this close.\u201d</p><p>Lucas tried to leap forward, but his legs were useless, the bones reshaping, too weak now to\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhen you get to hell, tell my old man I said hello.\u201d Rafe pulled the trigger.</p><p>Sarah barreled into Rafe just as he fired. Lucas lurched to the side. The bullet missed his head but plowed into his exposed stomach, burning through muscle and lodging deep in his gut. The silver was molten, frying him from the inside out, and Lucas opened his mouth to yell\u2014</p> <p>And the wolf\u2019s cry of pain rang into the night.</p><p>\u201cThe hero\u2019s going to die.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lifted his head and narrowed his eyes. Sarah and Rafe were in a tangle of limbs, fighting for the gun. Sarah was no match for the bastard.</p><p>I am.</p><p>He pushed back the fire, bunched his legs and\u2014</p><p>Two coyotes sprang at him. Lucas swiped at them, catching one on the back and breaking another\u2019s leg. They kept fighting him, snapping, clawing.</p><p>Get out of here, Lucas! Sarah\u2019s cry but . . . only in his mind.</p><p>He could feel her then, the warmth of her touch, her scent. Inside, though, not out.</p> <p>What the hell is happening? Lucas pushed the question through their link. Why did Caleb attack me?</p><p>She cried out then and his head snapped toward her. Sarah was on the ground, not moving. Rafe rose beside her, the gun still in his hand. He pointed the gun at her.</p><p>No! Piers stop him!</p><p>Piers bolted past Lucas.</p><p>Don\u2019t let him kill her!</p><p>Lucas sank his teeth into the nearest coyote. The asshole screamed, a high, keening cry.</p><p>Piers slammed into Rafe. Rafe staggered, fell, but before Piers could close in for the kill, the coyotes attacked, immediately surrounding him.</p><p>They swarmed. Slashing. Biting. Piers\u2019s white coat turned red as he went down.</p><p>Piers! For a moment, Lucas\u2019s vision went gray as fury churned his blood.</p><p>They\u2019re all gonna die.</p><p>Lucas swung his head to the left. Caleb stalked toward him, his white coat gleaming. They\u2019re all gonna die and the blood will be on your hands, Alpha. Caleb\u2019s taunt.</p><p>The psychic link between him and Caleb was sharp, perfectly focused. The way it was supposed to be between pack-mates.</p><p>Why the hell are you doing this? Lucas wanted his blood. Why are you turning on me?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen this coming. He\u2019d fought side-by-side with Caleb for so long, and he\u2019d never seen\u2014</p><p>Caleb\u2019s teeth snapped closed as the two wolves circled each other. What makes you think I was ever with you?</p><p>Fucking bastard.</p><p>Lucas attacked. Caleb\u2019s wolf was just as big as his, but not nearly as strong\u2014and not nearly as fucking pissed.</p><p>Lucas raked his claws down Caleb\u2019s side. Caleb snarled but backed away.</p><p>The guy didn\u2019t try to fight at all\u2014just backed away. Lucas slammed his front paws onto Caleb. The other wolf fell. Lucas locked his teeth around Caleb\u2019s throat.</p><p>The bastard still wasn\u2019t fighting back. Why aren\u2019t you fighting? You want to take me out? Then fight!</p><p>But Caleb wasn\u2019t fighting or answering. Caleb wasn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>Watch out! Sarah\u2019s voice in his mind. Weaker than before.</p><p>Lucas jumped back instinctively, but the bullet still hit him; this time, it lodged in his back. Fuck. Fire burned near his spine. Lucas\u2019s claws dug into the earth. The coyotes were coming back, closing in, but screw them.</p><p>He took the pain that blazed through his body. Took it, used it, and Lucas launched into the air. His paws crashed into Rafe, and the asshole fell. The gun flew from his fingers and hit the ground. Rafe fought him, catching his claws, holding tight with both hands. Lucas\u2019s blood dripped on the bastard.</p><p>A coyote locked his teeth around Lucas\u2019s right hind leg. Another dog caught the left. They dragged him off as he howled his rage.</p><p>Rafe laughed. \u201cGuess the mighty have fucking fallen, huh?\u201d The other coyotes attacked.</p><p>The last thing Lucas saw was Sarah\u2019s face. She\u2019d staggered to her feet. Blood dripped down her cheek and terror filled her eyes.</p><p>Lucas. Her desperate fear filled his mind.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry, babe. I got this.</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not.</p><p>Then he couldn\u2019t see anything but teeth and claws.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Dane ordered as the van squealed to a stop.</p><p>\u201cYou try to break free, you so much as make a single sound . . .\u201d</p><p>The woman with the golden eyes blinked at him. She lifted her bound hands and pointed to her gag.</p><p>\u201cYou try to escape, I\u2019ll have to knock you out again.\u201d Right, he was bullshitting there. He wouldn\u2019t be around to knock her out. Because the blood was flowing close by and the fight called. He grabbed her arms and jerked her up toward him. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and then gave a slow nod.</p><p>He sprang from the van, ran, and knew that she\u2019d be long gone when he came back.</p><p>If he came back.</p><p>He rushed down the dark road. He hadn\u2019t parked too close, that would have been dangerous. But he could hear the fight, the snarls and the growls, and when he rounded the corner, he knew he\u2019d see\u2014</p><p>Caleb jumped at him and took his ass down to the pavement.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch,\u201d Rafe snarled, whirling on Sarah. \u201cI was going to let you live, I was going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. He\u2019d already sent his attack dogs after her. Hayden had been ready to slice her open.</p><p>Piers had finally shaken free of the coyotes who\u2019d attacked him. The big white wolf stalked toward the group attacking Lucas. His movements were slow, and blood soaked his right side.</p><p>\u201cFor old times\u2019 sake,\u201d Rafe told her with the grin that had once made her heart race faster, \u201cI\u2019ll make it quick.\u201d</p><p>She kept her gaze on him, but she let her thoughts shoot out, let her mind connect with the wolf. Piers.</p><p>His rage hit her first. The wild fury of the wolf. Destroy. Attack. Protect Alpha.</p><p>\u201cOur old times are over,\u201d Sarah said, lifting her chin. She could feel the wetness of blood on her cheek. \u201cAnd they were never that good.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s eyes narrowed with a flare of rage.</p><p>Piers, come to me.</p><p>The white wolf froze. She swallowed and kept her gaze on Rafe. He could strike at any moment. She didn\u2019t have time for . . .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t that good.\u201d His gaze dismissed her. \u201cSo maybe I will make this hurt.\u201d</p><p>Great. She should have kept her mouth shut.</p><p>Piers, here. Attack!</p><p>The white wolf\u2019s body shuddered and he began running toward her. Fast, faster . . . \u201cThere\u2019s something you should know,\u201d Sarah told Rafe quietly.</p><p>One brow rose.</p><p>\u201cI definitely plan to make your death hurt.\u201d Attack him Piers! The white wolf hit Rafe, and they both barreled to the ground.</p><p>She muttered, \u201cGuess you didn\u2019t see him coming,\u201d and her shoulders sagged.</p><p>Go for the throat, Piers. Go for\u2014</p><p>Rafe shoved off the white wolf as he screamed in agony. Piers had bitten him. Not a death bite, not deep enough but\u2014</p><p>Rafe tossed the white wolf into the side of the warehouse. Piers was so weak he wasn\u2019t fighting back.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Rafe spun back to her. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>Get back, Sarah. Lucas\u2019s order, drifting in her mind. Run.</p><p>She stumbled, nearly fell in the blood on the ground, but then she turned and ran as fast as she could.</p><p>\u201cCome back, damn you!\u201d Rafe\u2019s scream. He\u2019d be running after her. He\u2019d be\u2014</p><p>She risked a glance over her shoulder. Lucas had him. They were fighting, man versus wolf. Rafe wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat Lucas, not while Lucas was in wolf form. But . . .</p><p>But Lucas was hurt. He\u2019d taken two silver hits. His pain beat at her, steady, burning, a fire that churned from the inside of his body. In the blood.</p><p>Lucas?</p><p>Rafe lifted something, metal glinted. No, not just metal. Silver. Her knife. Sarah tripped and hit the cement. Her hand went to her ankle sheath. Gone. Hell, no, she\u2019d lost her knife.</p><p>She whipped her head back to the fight. The coyotes were down or limping away, Piers wasn\u2019t moving, but Rafe was still up, and slashing out with that knife.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t run and leave Lucas. If Rafe killed him . . .</p><p>Snarls reached her ears. Angry, fierce. Sarah barely had time to stagger to her feet when two more wolves burst onto the scene.</p><p>A white wolf with a pelt already stained red. A black wolf with teeth dripping blood. Caleb and Dane.</p><p>She tried to reach their minds, but found only a tangle of fury and desperation.</p><p>Sarah sucked in a deep breath. She could do this. Rafe had been right about one thing. She had her secrets. Not weak. At least, not now she couldn\u2019t be weak. Her heart pounded so hard her chest shook but she advanced on Caleb and Dane.</p><p>Dane, break away. Go help Lucas.</p><p>Dane\u2019s big body shuddered. He glanced up at her. Caleb swiped his claws down Dane\u2019s right side. Sarah winced, feeling the pain herself. Dane, go.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to resist her order. In wolf form, he\u2019d be helpless.</p><p>Because Sarah couldn\u2019t just talk to the wolves. Rafe had actually spoken the truth. She could control the wolves.</p><p>A rare charmer\u2014and a dangerous one. As Rafe had come to learn.</p><p>Dane bounded away from Caleb. The white wolf shook his head, frowning. She caught Caleb\u2019s thoughts, heard the\u2014</p><p>Come back and fight, bastard\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stepped forward. Caleb growled at her as his head lowered toward the ground. He arched, bending low, getting ready to attack. Stand down, Caleb.</p><p>A tremor shook his body.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell is happening here, but you need to stand down.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s smoky eyes were locked on her. She pressed deeper into his mind. There was a shield there, one she hadn\u2019t noticed before during her little \u201ctest,\u201d because she hadn\u2019t probed deep enough. If she could just\u2014</p><p>Don\u2019t remember inviting you inside.</p><p>Her knees locked. If a wolf could smile, well, Caleb would be grinning right then.</p><p>Think you can control me?</p><p>\u201cStand down.\u201d Her whisper held a tremble of fear. Think again.</p><p>He leapt at her. Sarah didn\u2019t even have time to scream before he had her on the ground. His weight suffocated her, taking all her breath away.</p><p>All wolves aren\u2019t the same. His snarl.</p><p>Caleb, no! She pressed her power at him, shoving with all she was worth. Go, run away! You don\u2019t want to kill me!</p><p>The scent of blood and wolf filled her nostrils. Yes, I do.</p><p>His head lowered. His teeth hovered over her throat. Call them. His taunt echoed in her mind. Tell them to come and save you.</p><p>Lucas and Dane.</p><p>His teeth scraped her throat. Call them, he ordered.</p><p>Sarah swallowed. Lucas! Dane!</p><p>Caleb nuzzled her throat. Good girl.</p><p>The earth shook around her. The wolves were racing to her rescue. And Rafe? What was he\u2014</p><p>A motor gunned to life.</p><p>Escaping.</p><p>Dane growled. Get the fuck away from her.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t bother with an order. He just plowed right into Caleb. They rolled off her, twisting and turning, banging into the concrete.</p><p>Sarah scrambled off the ground and ran a hand over her throat. Caleb could have killed her in an instant, but he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Now Caleb lay on the ground, Lucas at his throat, and the white wolf wasn\u2019t fighting. Wasn\u2019t moving at all. Just waiting for death.</p><p>And death was coming. Lucas snarled and went in for the kill.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d She jumped to her feet. Dane raced in front of her. She wasn\u2019t sure if Dane was trying to protect her or tying to keep her from stopping Lucas. Either way, she didn\u2019t have time to touch his mind and find out. \u201cStop, Lucas!\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s teeth snapped together. He swung his head toward her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not fighting anymore,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t kill him.\u201d Not until we can figure out what\u2019s happening. Why he betrayed you.</p><p>The black wolf\u2019s head jerked, but then Lucas surged forward and caught Caleb\u2019s neck between his teeth.</p><p>No, I told you not to kill him!</p><p>With his jaws closed around Caleb\u2019s neck, Lucas lifted the white wolf, then slammed Caleb\u2019s head down into the concrete. Caleb\u2019s eyes fell closed, but his chest kept rising and falling. Still alive.</p><p>Her breath rushed out. Lucas loped back toward her, his sides heaving, his gait slower now. How much silver was inside him? Eating at him?</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d She held her hands out to him. His head butted against her palm. His eyes closed.</p><p>Then he fell at her feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 11</p><p>Dane drove the van at breakneck speed. He\u2019d pulled on a pair of jeans\u2014Sarah didn\u2019t know where the hell he\u2019d gotten those\u2014and the van careened down the road. There was a woman in the back of the van with them. A familiar, bound woman who stared at her with wide eyes and kept trying to choke out something behind her gag.</p><p>Sarah knew she should probably try to help her, but the woman wasn\u2019t in any immediate danger then and\u2014</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t about to let go of Lucas. He\u2019d shifted after he\u2019d collapsed, and Dane had carried him into the van. His blood was everywhere, his breath rasping out, and Sarah was . . . scared. No, terrified.</p> <p>They\u2019d left a pile of dead coyotes behind them. Left Caleb. Sarah didn\u2019t know what would happen to the white wolf, and right then, she didn\u2019t care. All that mattered was Lucas.</p><p>\u201cGot to . . . get the bullets . . . out . . .\u201d His voice was so weak.</p><p>She stared down at the mess that was his stomach and didn\u2019t know where to start.</p><p>His head lay in her lap. He tried to heave up to check out the damage.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her hands tightened on him. She couldn\u2019t control him anymore, but she damn sure didn\u2019t want him to see the damage. \u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d</p> <p>His blue eyes weren\u2019t so bright anymore. \u201cBeen . . . shot . . . before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got you with silver.\u201d She would not cry. But . . . this was her fault. The whole thing had been a trap. Rafe hadn\u2019t been holding Dane. If she hadn\u2019t gone out on her own, this never would have happened.</p><p>\u201cBeen . . . hit . . . with silver . . . too . . .\u201d The words seemed softer. \u201cCan dig it . . .\u201d His claws ripped through the tops of his fingers. \u201cOut . . .\u201d</p><p>Her nails dug into his skin. \u201cThey were some kind of\u2014of exploding bullets.\u201d Had to be based on the damage. They\u2019d shattered on impact. She\u2019d seen something like this once before, and that poor bastard hadn\u2019t survived. Lucas will. \u201cYou can\u2019t just dig them out. They\u2019re in pieces, fragmented.\u201d Smart asshole. Rafe had known exactly what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cLet me see him.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew up. Piers was awake. His eyes were narrowed, and dried blood marked his face. He\u2019d shifted twice already in the van. Shifted twice, then passed out. But he seemed to be back with them now, and most of his wounds had healed.</p> <p>He reached for Lucas.</p><p>She bit her lip.</p><p>His fingers skated over the wounds, and his breath hissed out when he saw the full extent of the injuries. \u201cCan you shift, man?\u201d</p><p>The lines on Lucas\u2019s face had deepened. If I could . . . I . . . would . . . have . . .\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d wasted all his energy, fighting for her.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get him to a hospital,\u201d Piers yelled to Dane. The woman with the gag froze, her eyes huge.</p><p>Sarah slid her fingers down the side of Lucas\u2019s cheek. \u201cA hospital isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get the silver out!\u201d Piers snapped. \u201cEither we dig it out or\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She grabbed his hand, held tight. \u201cIt\u2019s in his blood.\u201d Her voice was low, but she knew Lucas still heard her. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? It\u2019s fragmented, in his organs, in his blood\u2014in him.\u201d Burning him alive, from the inside out. The legends about wolves and silver had been so true. Some called it an allergy. A genetic quirk.</p><p>But silver could truly kill a wolf shifter. The more intense the exposure, the quicker the death. And you didn\u2019t get more intense than a blood exposure. \u201cWe need more than a doctor,\u201d she whispered and felt just as she\u2019d felt months before. Helpless. Because Sarah was very afraid that Lucas would be dying in her arms.</p><p>Not what I planned.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Came Dane\u2019s snarl. \u201cHe\u2019s not dying!\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s gaze was on Sarah. She knew he saw the knowledge there. \u201cI . . . am,\u201d he said. Soft. Not sad. Not afraid. Not Lucas.</p><p>Her cheek was wet. Blood or tears? Or both?</p><p>\u201cWho can help him?\u201d Piers asked, voice breaking.</p><p>Sarah couldn\u2019t look away from Lucas.</p><p>Piers grabbed her upper arm. Shook her. \u201cWho can help him?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together to control the tremble. The van hit a pothole and they all lurched, but Piers\u2019s grip never wavered. \u201cYou know any witches?\u201d she whispered, and she wasn\u2019t kidding. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take. Medicine won\u2019t work. We need magic.\u201d So much blood. Soon he\u2019d bleed silver. \u201cOne hell of a lot of magic.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath and smelled death. \u201cYou know anyone with that kind of power, Piers?\u201d</p><p>His hold eased on her. \u201cYeah, yeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew up and a rush of wild hope had her choking on her breath.</p><p>\u201cDane . . .\u201d Piers\u2019s face could have been cut from rock. \u201cTurn this bitch around and get us to Gaines and Hillray.\u201d</p><p>Lucas stiffened against her. \u201cPiers . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Marie Dusean can\u2019t help you, no one can,\u201d Piers said. \u201cLook, I been keeping track of her group since that vampire hell, I know where they are. Believe me, if anyone can help, she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she will,\u201d Dane called from the front, and the van swerved as he turned the vehicle around.</p><p>Marie?</p><p>A hard curl lifted Piers\u2019s lips. \u201cTell me, charmer, have you ever heard of the mambo?\u201d</p><p>Mambo. The hair on her arms rose. Mambo . . . voodoo priestess.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf anyone has power in LA, it\u2019s her.\u201d His stare dropped to Lucas. The alpha\u2019s eyes had drifted closed. \u201cYou hold on, dammit! We got some power coming.\u201d</p><p>It had just better be enough.</p><p>Because if it wasn\u2019t, Lucas would die.</p><p>The sun had set when they reached the house on Gaines and Hillray. Men and women in white stood along the porch of the long, rambling house, and when the van squealed to a stop, they didn\u2019t race forward, but they didn\u2019t run away, either. They just turned toward the road. Watched. Waited.</p><p>Dane spun in his seat. \u201cYou think she\u2019ll see us?\u201d</p><p>Piers shoved open the back doors. \u201cI\u2019m not giving her a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a choice, wolf,\u201d a deep, masculine voice said. The voice rose and fell with the musical cadence of a Haitian accent.</p><p>The owner of that voice\u2014a tall, dark-skinned man\u2014stood just beyond the van. His arms were crossed over his chest. His head was cocked, and his too-knowing eyes were on Lucas. Like the others, he wore white. Loose white pants, white shirt, and even some kind of long, white scarf that had been wound around his neck.</p><p>Piers jumped from the van. \u201cWe need to see Marie.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s gaze drifted to him. \u201cMambo don\u2019t want to see you, wolf. After the way you disrespected her last home . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cTake your dead and go. You\u2019re not gettin\u2019 help here.\u201d</p><p>But they had to get help. There wasn\u2019t another option.</p><p>\u201cWe were looking for our pack member.\u201d It sounded like the words were gritted from between Piers\u2019s teeth. \u201cWe weren\u2019t after the mambo, just the vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you came on the mambo\u2019s land. You came as animals and you attacked when the mambo was near.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m fucking sorry, okay? But we need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Sarah whispered because Lucas wasn\u2019t moving anymore. Didn\u2019t seem to be breathing. \u201cIf she can help him\u2014please.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Sarah lowered her lips to Lucas\u2019s. She pressed her mouth to his. You\u2019re supposed to be the strongest, the most bad-ass. You can\u2019t go out like this.</p><p>Anger had her blood heating and her body shaking.</p><p>I won\u2019t let you go out like this.</p><p>She kissed him again. Tasted salt and blood. Then she eased him carefully off her lap. His blood smeared across her clothes, but she didn\u2019t care. She held his head carefully, easing him down to the bed of the van. Then Sarah hurried forward, her eyes going to the big brick wall of a Haitian who was between her and\u2014</p><p>Marie Dusean. Voodoo priestess extraordinaire. Oh, damn but the stories she\u2019d heard about ladies with power like Marie\u2019s . . .</p><p>She jumped from the van, and would have fallen, if Piers hadn\u2019t caught her so quickly. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said again, looking up, way up, at the man\u2019s face. Now that they were closer, she could see the scars that criss-crossed the right side of his face. \u201cWe need her help.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed on her. \u201cYou smell like wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis blood\u2019s on me.\u201d Literally, figuratively, every way.</p><p>The Haitian\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cCharmer.\u201d He sighed out the word and his mouth curved. \u201cLost little charmer out among the wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lost.\u201d Not anymore. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>A woman walked up behind the brick wall. A woman with long, braided black hair and skin that seemed to shine under the moon\u2019s light. The woman wore white, too. A light, gauzy top and a skirt that barely skimmed the tops of her long legs. And a thin white scarf circled her neck\u2014just like the Haitian\u2019s. The woman pointed one slender finger at Sarah. \u201cMarie wants to see her.\u201d No Haitian accent from her. Just the soft rolls of the south.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s shoulders slumped with relief. Okay, seeing Marie was something. If she could see her, talk to her, Sarah was sure she\u2019d get the mambo to help.</p><p>Sarah brushed by Piers. The woman\u2019s fingers wrapped around her wrist. Piers tried to step forward and go with her.</p><p>The Haitian shoved a hand against Piers\u2019s chest. \u201cNot you, wolf.\u201d</p><p>Sarah kept her head up as she followed the woman in white. The wooden porch steps creaked beneath her feet, and the light from inside the house\u2014soft, flickering light\u2014seemed to beckon her closer. Candlelight. The whole place was lit with\u2014</p><p>Sarah almost tripped as she headed into the house. She glanced down quickly at the doorway. Some kind of dark red dirt lined the entranceway.</p><p>\u201cThe wolf would never have made it past the door,\u201d her guide said, her voice soft, but she didn\u2019t glance back.</p><p>Sarah kept following the other woman, aware of the fierce tension in her shoulders and the blood that was literally on her hands. Have to hurry. Because Lucas didn\u2019t have much time. Not much time at all.</p><p>\u201cGo in there.\u201d The woman freed Sarah\u2019s wrist and pointed to the white door on the left.</p><p>Sarah lifted her hand to knock.</p><p>\u201cNo, just go in. She\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s fingers shook a bit when she grasped the doorknob. She twisted it and the door swung inward with a groan.</p><p>More candles. Flickering. The scents of jasmine and vanilla hung in the air. And in the far right corner, a woman leaned over an old wooden table. Her long hair\u2014a shade of smoke between black and pure gray\u2014cloaked her features.</p><p>\u201cCome in, child,\u201d she murmured, her voice rising and falling in the same rhythm as the man. Her native accent. Haiti. Marie Dusean lifted her head and her hair slipped back, revealing a face lined with knowledge and time, a face that was strangely beautiful. Otherworldly. But Marie\u2019s eyes . . . those blue eyes were cloudy. Far too cloudy to see.</p><p>Cataracts? Was that\u2014</p><p>\u201cI can see everything I need to see,\u201d Marie told her. \u201cFar more than you.\u201d Her gnarled fingers lifted and she beckoned Sarah closer. An empty seat waited on the other side of the table.</p><p>Sarah walked forward slowly as her gaze searched the shadows. The wooden floor creaked beneath her.</p><p>\u201cOnly us,\u201d Marie told her. \u201cNo more eyes . . . no more ears . . .\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s fingers slid over the back of the chair. \u201cI have a friend outside. He needs your help.\u201d</p><p>Those blank eyes stared up at her and a faint smile curved Marie\u2019s lips. A smile that was the faintest bit cruel. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d want to help the wolf?\u201d</p><p>Her palms were sweating. \u201cBecause he\u2019ll die if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Marie\u2019s hands slapped against the wooden table top. \u201cMight anyway.\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>Marie leaned forward. \u201cMatters so much to you, does he?\u201d</p><p>Sarah eased around the chair and sat, hard, her knees weak. Was Marie reading her mind? \u201cHe saved me. I can\u2019t let him die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t stop Death.\u201d A shrug. \u201cNot when he\u2019s coming.\u201d Those eyes were just eerie as they locked on her. \u201cHe\u2019s coming for you, charmer.\u201d</p><p>First the Haitian, now the mambo. \u201cHow did you know I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial . . . aren\u2019t you?\u201d The thin shawl around Marie\u2019s shoulders slipped a bit. \u201cBetter be careful. Some would kill for a little power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just here about Lucas.\u201d She reached forward, scared but determined, and caught the mambo\u2019s hands in hers. \u201cPlease. I\u2019ll do anything. \u201d</p><p>Marie laughed and the hollow sound chilled Sarah. \u201cHow badly do you want him?\u201d</p><p>The hair on her nape rose.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you trade?\u201d Marie pressed.</p><p>Sarah hesitated.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . what I thought. Not yet ready to give your life for his, are you?\u201d</p><p>The woman was jerking her around. Ancient or not, this Marie was as sharp as they came. \u201cCan you save him?\u201d Maybe she hadn\u2019t been asking the right questions.</p><p>\u201cI can do anything.\u201d Not boasting. Sounded just like Marie was stating a fact.</p><p>\u201cCan you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo ways . . . Stop him before Death comes . . .\u201d Her eyes slit a bit. \u201cDrag him back after. But, you might not like how he comes back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, hell, no, the woman had not just offered to make Lucas into what\u2014a freaking zombie?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked, child. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time, wouldn\u2019t be the last.\u201d Her gaze trekked to the window on the right. \u201cSometimes folks can\u2019t let go.\u201d A hint of sadness colored the words.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him dead. I want you to save him.\u201d</p> <p>Marie\u2019s stare turned back to her. \u201cWhat will you give?\u201d</p><p>Dammit. Time was running out. For Lucas? \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>A small nod and some of the lines smoothed from Marie\u2019s forehead. The woman almost looked . . . satisfied. \u201cGood. But it won\u2019t take all that.\u201d</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Maxime bring in your man.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah leapt to her feet. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll really be able to save him? He\u2019s got silver in his blood. The bullets fragmented and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready know that.\u201d The thin shawl slipped down her shoulders another few inches. \u201cIf your man didn\u2019t have such a strong spirit, Death would already have him.\u201d Those cloudy eyes closed. \u201cFelt his spirit long ago, when he came after my Maya. Knew he was coming, long before he set foot on my land.\u201d</p><p>Maya. The name clicked. Maya Black was a vampire in LA. Powerful, kick-ass, and rumored to be mated to an equally powerful shifter.</p><p>\u201cStrong spirit,\u201d the mambo whispered again. \u201cSpirit wants you, charmer. He\u2019s not making this easy.\u201d</p><p>No, Lucas wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Marie\u2019s eyes opened and fixed unerringly on her. \u201cIf Death takes him, you want me to bring him back?\u201d</p> <p>Her breath caught in her throat, almost choking her. \u201cHow bad you want him to stay with you?\u201d Marie pressed, blind eyes watching too closely.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Back from the dead? This was too beyond her experience. You can\u2019t do that. That was her instinctual response. No, that was the way she\u2019d been raised to think. But the truth was . . . vampires bit their prey, demons played with fire, and she controlled wolves. \u201cI just want him to live,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he will.\u201d Marie rose, her long hair fluttering around her. \u201cMaybe he won\u2019t.\u201d Her smile was gone. \u201cEither way, I\u2019ll be collecting what\u2019s owed to me.\u201d</p><p>A chill slipped down Sarah\u2019s spine. \u201cSave him.\u201d</p><p>Marie\u2019s head inclined. \u201cBut there\u2019s no saving everyone. No matter how you fight, Death will still be there.\u201d The candles flickered. Marie\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cWhen the time comes, tell her to let go.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cUm, tell who?\u201d</p><p>But Marie just smiled her small, tight smile.</p><p>The candles flickered again, a wild, desperate dance, and the shadows in the room lengthened as Marie began to chant.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d Dane said, his shoulders brushing Piers\u2019s as they faced off against the men and women blocking the entrance to Marie Dusean\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only idea I had,\u201d Piers growled back at him.</p><p>Their claws were out. Claws and teeth were the only weapons they had. Normally, that would be enough, but with Marie\u2014</p><p>If half the stories floating around about her were true, claws and teeth wouldn\u2019t even scratch her skin.</p><p>Dane threw a glance over his shoulder. Lucas barely seemed to breathe. The stench of silver burned Dane\u2019s nose. Dammit, this was not the way the alpha should have been taken out. Not for\u2014</p><p>Me.</p><p>His breath hissed out. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have made the trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t him,\u201d Piers said, not looking his way. Piers had locked his gaze on the big Haitian with the seen-the-devil eyes. \u201cSarah went for the trade.\u201d</p><p>Grunts reached his ears. Frantic, wild. Muffled. He turned his head and caught the golden gaze glaring at him. Her. Hell. He couldn\u2019t just leave her bound and gagged. Not forever.</p><p>When hell had come calling at that coyote slaughterhouse, he\u2019d grabbed the woman. Human. As far as he could figure, anyway. He\u2019d heard the screams of the coyotes, smelled the blood, and knew that a war had broken out. He\u2019d tossed the blonde over his shoulder and held tight as he fought his way out of that nightmare. He\u2019d gotten away, mostly in one piece.</p><p>And he\u2019d taken her with him.</p><p>He\u2019d thought they might get information from her. Thought they might be able to use her.</p><p>Her head twisted toward the line of men and women in white, and she mumbled something behind the gag.</p><p>Hell. He leaned into the van and yanked out her gag.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d she whispered. \u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying.\u201d That was all that needed to be said. If they had to trade with the devil, so be it.</p><p>She gulped. \u201cMarie won\u2019t help you for free. There\u2019s always a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll pay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if she wants wolf pelts?\u201d</p><p>His fingers brushed her delicate jaw. \u201cHe\u2019s not dying.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze seemed to bore into him. \u201cYou\u2019re playing with some serious fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a human, you are, too.\u201d</p><p>He caught the flicker of her lashes. Ah . . .</p><p>\u201cBring the wolf.\u201d The voice boomed into the night.</p><p>Dane spun back around. The big Haitian had stepped forward. \u201cMarie will take him.\u201d</p><p>He caught sight of Sarah\u2019s hair then, blowing in the breeze. A breeze, shit\u2014where had that come from?</p><p>Sarah ran toward him, her face stark white. \u201cShe\u2019ll help us!\u201d</p><p>Hot damn.</p><p>\u201cPiers, Dane, bring him in!\u201d</p><p>Carefully, he and Piers lifted Lucas. The alpha\u2019s head hung limply and his eyes never opened.</p><p>They\u2019d taken four steps when he heard the crunch of gravel. Dane glanced back. The woman\u2014still didn\u2019t know her name\u2014was outside of the van, and the ropes were at her feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go in there!\u201d She stared at the line of white with narrowed eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t trade with her\u2014just let him go!\u201d</p><p>She meant let him die.</p><p>No.</p><p>She shook her head and backed away slowly. \u201cYou already have enough enemies after you. Do you really need more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, Karen,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cThis call isn\u2019t yours to make.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Sarah knew her?</p><p>Karen turned around and ran into the night.</p><p>Dane\u2019s shoulders stiffened as they approached the house. Piers was heading in first, his hold on Lucas\u2019s feet and\u2014</p><p>Piers froze. No, not just froze. The guy seemed to slam into some kind of brick wall.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t enter.\u201d The Haitian. He pushed Piers out of the way and grabbed Lucas\u2019s feet. \u201cToo much of the beast inside. Wanting to break free, is he?\u201d</p><p>Piers growled. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you take\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re losing control.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice rang out, lifting and rolling like the man\u2019s. \u201cHow long will it be . . .\u201d A small woman appeared, skin dark, her eyes blue\u2014blind. Marie Dusean. \u201cBefore you lose yourself?\u201d</p><p>The breeze was back, stronger now.</p><p>Marie turned her stare onto Dane. \u201cYou like the pain too much now.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou won\u2019t make it inside either. Not with the demon on your back.\u201d</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a choice,\u201d she whispered to him. \u201cGo back to the shadows and the screams, Dane, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another man tried to shoulder him out of the way. His hold tightened on Lucas.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying,\u201d Sarah whispered, her hands wrapping around his. \u201cJust let her take him.\u201d</p><p>That blind stare of Marie\u2019s was still on him. \u201cScreams or sacrifice, Dane. Choose.\u201d</p><p>He let Lucas go.</p><p>Marie\u2019s men took Lucas inside. Sarah hurried after them. Fuck this, he was going, too. Dane barreled forward\u2014</p><p>And seemed to slam into the same invisible wall that Piers had hit.</p><p>\u201cEvil can\u2019t cross my line,\u201d Marie\u2019s voice floated back to him.</p><p>Line? He looked up, down\u2014and saw the line of red dust. And wait\u2014had she said evil? Dane glanced at Piers. Since when in the hell were they evil?</p><p>Too much of the beast inside.</p><p>His fist slammed into nothing, but it sure as shit felt like he\u2019d just punched a solid wall.</p><p>They lowered Lucas onto a table. Candles were placed at his feet, his head, and near his bound hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you tying him down?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cSo he doesn\u2019t kill us,\u201d the Haitian\u2014Maxime\u2014said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHe can barely move.\u201d Wasn\u2019t moving, \u201cWhy would you need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Marie threw a gray liquid onto Lucas. Her chants filled the room. The clouds left her eyes and the blue sharpened, too bright, glittering . . .</p><p>A howl tore from Lucas. He arched up, nearly ripping his binds apart. Silver began to leak from the deep wounds on his body.</p><p>\u201cHold him,\u201d Maxime ordered.</p><p>Sarah jumped forward. Her hands pressed down on Lucas\u2019s chest. His eyes opened, burning as brightly as Marie\u2019s, and they locked on her. \u201cSarah . . .\u201d The broken rasp of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d she told him, talking quickly, babbling.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting the silver out, you\u2019re going to be fine, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sagged back against the table. His eyes still stared up at her, but he\u2014he was gone.</p><p>Dead?</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s gaze flew up. Marie had her hands in the air, her chants came now, fast, but low. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Sarah demanded.</p><p>Marie kept chanting.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Sarah tore her hands away from Lucas.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>The binds snapped, and he surged off the table.</p><p>\u201cHold him!\u201d Maxime yelled.</p><p>She turned back to him, but Lucas was already changing. The snap and crunch of bones filled her ears. His body convulsed, twisting, heaving, as fur burst over his skin.</p><p>\u201cReach for the beast,\u201d Marie said. \u201cControl him.\u201d</p><p>Sarah took a breath and tried to find a psychic link with his wolf. Lucas?</p><p>Pain hit her, tearing apart her insides, ripping, burning . . .</p><p>Sarah fell to the floor.</p><p>\u201cHold him,\u201d Marie murmured. \u201cHold the spirits close, don\u2019t let them go.\u201d</p><p>Spirits. The pain had tears leaking from her eyes. Shifters had two souls, two spirits inside of them. Man and beast. She could feel them both right then. The savage pain of the beast. The fury of the man. Both buffeting her.</p><p>Lucas, stay with me.</p><p>A small cloud appeared before her mouth, as if she were cold, and suddenly Sarah was shuddering because the temperature in the room seemed to have dropped about fifty degrees.</p><p>\u201cHold him tighter,\u201d Marie\u2019s voice rose. \u201cDon\u2019t let go!\u201d</p><p>Did she mean hold him psychically? Hold him physically? Sarah forced herself to move, to crawl back to the table. The psychic link had broken because the wolf was gone and only the man remained. She grabbed his arm. Ice cold.</p><p>Sarah tried to find his mind, but with the wolf gone, she couldn\u2019t connect with him.</p><p>\u201cWill you bind to him?\u201d Marie\u2019s whisper floated to her.</p><p>Sarah glanced up. Maxime was at her side. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want him to live, you bind.\u201d Marie grabbed her left hand. Stretched it out and turned her wrist up. \u201cDo you bind?\u201d</p><p>If it meant Lucas lived, then . . . \u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>Maxime yanked out a knife and slashed her exposed flesh. Sarah didn\u2019t even have enough breath to scream right then.</p><p>\u201cHe lives . . . that\u2019s what you want?\u201d</p><p>Why the hell was Marie asking that? Wasn\u2019t it obvious? \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live, he lives . . .\u201d</p><p>Marie\u2019s fingers smeared the blood over Sarah\u2019s arm. Then the mambo lifted her blood-stained fingers into the air and seemed to paint letters. \u201cHe dies . . .\u201d</p><p>No!</p><p>The bright blue of Marie\u2019s eyes began to fade. \u201cThen you die.\u201d</p><p>All of the candles sputtered out. The darkness swept over her, and the last sound Sarah heard was the growl of a wolf.</p><p>The figures in white slowly filed out of the dark house. Marie led the line, her hair a veil around her face. Dane tensed when he saw her. He could almost feel the power crackling in the air around her.</p><p>\u201cDid he make it?\u201d Piers voiced his obvious fear.</p><p>Marie stopped and spared him a glance. \u201cDeath wanted him.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Lucas had pulled his ass right out of hell before and he\u2019d let the alpha . . .</p><p>\u201cBut your wolf fought back.\u201d Her eyes looked right through them. \u201cHad to bind the souls. Life and death will follow, but for now . . . they live.\u201d</p><p>They? The wolf and the man?</p><p>Marie shook her head. \u201cHe has a weakness. One that could destroy him. Sometimes . . .\u201d She waved her hand in the air, and the big Haitian at her back stumbled, then seemed to topple onto the porch. \u201cWe just delay Death. We don\u2019t stop him.\u201d</p><p>The Haitian was on the ground now. Not moving. Eyes wide open.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to him?\u201d Dane asked, voice tight.</p><p>The delicate woman that he\u2019d seen before hit the ground next. Her braided hair spread behind her like a halo.</p><p>Shit. It looked like the mambo was killing her own people. Dane\u2019s claws burst through his skin.</p><p>\u201cEasy, wolf.\u201d Marie\u2019s head lowered as she stared at the man. Then the woman. \u201cThey did their service to me, so I was keeping my end of the deal.\u201d Her hand hovered over the Haitian. \u201cI didn\u2019t raise them, but I am setting them free.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Haitian\u2019s body stiffened as a fast rigor set in, the way it usually did when a vampire got staked. But wait, this guy wasn\u2019t a vamp. Dane hadn\u2019t caught the vamp scent on him.</p><p>But now the scent of death and decay\u2014several days old\u2014hung in the air.</p><p>Marie\u2019s head lifted. \u201cYou\u2019ll find them inside. Watch over them until dawn. Be ready for the betrayal and the choice, Dane.\u201d</p> <p>Piers was staring at the woman with the braided hair. Her body had tensed with rigor as well. The woman who\u2019d been walking around seconds ago now looked like a corpse. \u201cSonofabitch,\u201d Piers whispered. \u201cWhat was she? A damn zombie?\u201d</p><p>Marie didn\u2019t look at Piers. \u201cRemember what I say,\u201d she told Dane. \u201cScreams and pain or sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>Hell of a choice.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019ll make it.\u201d She turned away. Walked slowly down the porch and across the yard. Her attendants\u2014the ones still alive, anyway\u2014followed close behind her.</p><p>Dane didn\u2019t speak until the group had cleared the porch.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Piers grabbed his arm. \u201cIs Lucas alive or\u2014\u201d His hand jerked toward the dead bodies. \u201cOr is he like these poor bastards?\u201d</p><p>Like puppets on a string\u2014with a string that could be cut any moment. Because he\u2019d heard about cases like this, and Piers had been right . . . zombies. Or, as close as reality could come to the zombie nightmare.</p><p>Dane sucked in a breath and tasted death. \u201cHe\u2019s alive.\u201d Because he had a sick feeling in his gut. One that told him exactly what Marie had done to Lucas.</p><p>Weakness.</p><p>He crept toward the Haitian\u2019s body. Other than his skin already taking on a chalky appearance, he looked unharmed. How had he died? How had\u2014</p><p>Dane\u2019s eye narrowed on the white scarf around his neck. Both the Haitian and the woman had the scarves. Dane\u2019s fingers lifted and latched onto the soft fabric of the scarf. He tugged lightly . . . shit.</p> <p>The man\u2019s throat had been ripped open. The scarf had hid the wound, but\u2014ripped open.</p><p>\u201cOne of ours?\u201d Piers asked from behind him.</p><p>Dane\u2019s claws hovered over the wounds. \u201cShifter . . . can\u2019t say for sure if it was wolf.\u201d But his gut told him it was. He glanced up at Piers. \u201cIf a wolf killed her man, why would she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure she saved him?\u201d Piers charged for the door. Dane expected him to slam into that invisible wall again, but Piers ran right inside. Dane followed him, rushing forward. His shoes brushed against the loose dirt near the door. The line he\u2019d noticed before. But now, a huge chunk of that dirt had been cleared away. Like a path had been opened.</p><p>The hair on his nape rose but Dane kept going. Lucas was in there, and he\u2019d damn well better not be the living dead.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Piers\u2019s shout had him turning to the left. The candles were sputtering out, but his shifter vision let him see clearly. He hurried down the hallway, darted into the room, and saw them on the table.</p><p>Blood pooled beneath them. Lucas was on the table, Sarah on top of him. Her hair covered his face, and her arms hung limply, her fingertips nearly brushing that pool of blood.</p><p>They looked dead but he could hear\u2014</p> <p>Thump. Thump.</p><p>Their hearts. Beating in near perfect time with each other.</p><p>He has a weakness.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get them out of here,\u201d Piers muttered. \u201cThis place, man, it\u2019s creeping me out.\u201d</p><p>Dane hurried forward and reached for Sarah. He pulled her up against him, and her head sagged forward. The woman was out. Lucas was in no better shape. His eyes didn\u2019t open when Piers shook him. His slow breathing didn\u2019t change. But the gaping wounds on his stomach appeared smaller.</p><p>Piers inhaled. \u201cYou smell that?\u201d He looked down at the bloody floor. \u201cSilver.\u201d</p><p>No mistaking that metallic scent. \u201cLooks like Marie got it out of him.\u201d The relief was obvious in his voice. He hefted Sarah higher against his chest. They needed to leave. Marie had said Lucas and Sarah would be weak until dawn.</p><p>Piers wrapped one of Lucas\u2019s arms around his neck and lifted the alpha.</p><p>\u201cI can . . . walk . . .\u201d Lucas\u2019s faint growl, but he didn\u2019t open his eyes.</p><p>Piers froze. \u201cAlpha, you back?\u201d</p><p>A grim nod. His eyes were still closed.</p><p>\u201cDamn man!\u201d Piers burst out. \u201cYou scared the hell out of us! We thought you were dead when that silver got\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d His eyes opened now, faded blue. For an instant, his eyes looked just like Marie\u2019s. Then he blinked and the color deepened a bit. Became more like Lucas.</p><p>Piers\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou . . . what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me . . . about it . . . another time . . .\u201d His eyelids began to sag. \u201cNow let\u2019s get . . . out . . .\u201d</p><p>That sounded like one fine plan to Dane. He tightened his hold on Sarah\u2014her eyes were still closed, her heart still drumming slowly\u2014and hurried out of that dark room. When they hit the porch, the two bodies were gone, as if they\u2019d never been there.</p><p>The night was quiet. Too quiet. They climbed into the van. Lucas looked pale, but he was with them, dammit. And as soon as the alpha got settled into the back of the van, Lucas reached for Sarah.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do with her?\u201d Piers wanted to know.</p><p>Dane gunned the engine.</p><p>\u201cKeep her.\u201d Lucas\u2019s quiet response. Dane glanced in the mirror and saw Lucas gently brushing back Sarah\u2019s hair. The alpha? Gentle? What. The. Hell.</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t trust her. After tonight, after what happened . . .\u201d Piers heaved out a breath. \u201cMan, I\u2019ve got to tell you what she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater . . . Everything . . . later.\u201d</p><p>Piers\u2019s teeth snapped together but he gave a fast nod. A nod Lucas didn\u2019t see. The alpha\u2019s eyes had closed again.</p><p>Dane shoved the gas pedal down to the floor as he raced away from the mambo\u2019s house. He didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be followed by Marie\u2019s men, but he didn\u2019t want to take any chances.</p><p>They\u2019d have to watch out for the mambo until she collected her pound of flesh. Spells never came cheap. He knew. He\u2019d sure bled for plenty over the years.</p><p>\u201cCaleb.\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice rasped and Dane realized the alpha wasn\u2019t out completely, not yet.</p><p>Dane\u2019s gaze met Piers\u2019s in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s . . . dead,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>Maybe. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure what happened to him. Our priority was gettin\u2019 you out, we didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Said with more heat. \u201cTo us, dead. If you see him . . . again . . .\u201d</p><p>Caleb. A man who\u2019d been like a brother to him for ten years. A wolf who\u2019d attacked their alpha with fangs and claws.</p><p>Dane\u2019s fingers squeezed the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles turned white.</p><p>\u201cSend someone . . . back for his body . . .\u201d The alpha\u2019s breath heaved out. \u201cIf he . . . lives . . . I want him brought to the pack.\u201d A growl built in his throat. \u201cTrial by pack.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. That meant a fight to the death.</p><p>How the hell had this happened? Dane\u2019s jaw locked. All these years, and he\u2019d never known a traitor stood right next to him.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Sarah awoke to the feel of rough fingertips sliding down her arm. She gasped, jerked, and a hand closed over her wrist. A light pain hit her at the touch\u2014the flesh sensitive\u2014and her eyes flew open.</p><p>She found herself staring into intense blue eyes. Lucas.</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d murmured his name until his lips kicked up in a faint smile. The light of dawn surrounded him. \u201cNot dead yet, babe.\u201d</p><p>And she was so very grateful for that fact.</p><p>His fingers slid over the inside of her wrist. Her breath hissed out.</p><p>His gaze dropped to the jagged wound, a wound that had healed so much. Too much. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She sat up, and when the cold air hit her chest, she realized she was naked. Sarah snatched up the sheet with her right hand, feeling vulnerable. Nervous. Time for him to know everything. \u201cI-I made a trade with a voodoo priestess.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t blink. \u201cWhat did you trade?\u201d</p><p>Everything. \u201cI don\u2019t really know . . . Marie will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know to visit Marie Dusean?\u201d he asked, his thumb still caressing her flesh.</p><p>Sarah bit her lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2014we just needed magic. It was the only thing that would save you. Piers\u2014he knew how to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were dying! There wasn\u2019t a choice.\u201d Her gaze dropped to his stomach. He was fully healed. The only sign of his ordeal was a raised line on his stomach. Shifter healing, got to love it. \u201cThe silver was destroying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was burning me. Fucking burning me alive.\u201d His fingers fell away. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done, do you?\u201d</p><p>Saved your ass.</p><p>\u201cIf Marie cut you, she used your blood in a spell. She did something to you, Sarah.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what. I can\u2019t remember a damn thing, but she\u2019s got power over you now. Power over you and power over me.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cMarie is a very dangerous woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also the woman who saved your life.\u201d The sheet seemed cool against her flesh. Lucas\u2019s touch had been red-hot. \u201cWhen she calls me, I\u2019ll pay my debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what? Marie\u2019s a woman used to the shadows. Life and death . . .\u201d A rough laugh broke from him. \u201cThey don\u2019t always have meaning for her.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Bright eyes. Strong body. Alive. \u201cThey do for me.\u201d</p><p>The mattress dipped beneath his weight as he closed in on her. His hands came down on either side of Sarah, caging her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been keeping secrets, sweet Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap, this was it. \u201cLucas . . .\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed hers, stealing her breath. She wanted to press into him. To take his mouth, to take the pleasure.</p><p>But he\u2019d already pulled away. \u201cHow many lies have you told me?\u201d</p><p>The warmth chased from her skin. \u201cI\u2019ve told you the truth about myself. I\u2019m a charmer, just like I said, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Bit off. His eyes glittered at her. \u201cRight now I don\u2019t give a shit what you are or who you work for.\u201d His hands caught her shoulders. \u201cI should . . . but now, I just want you.\u201d Then his mouth took hers, hard and deep, the way she\u2019d wanted.</p><p>Sarah gasped into his mouth, her heart thundering. Her tongue met his and the need, that reckless want built in her. A fierce desire to match his.</p><p>They were both already naked. The sheet was a thin barrier, one that he yanked out of the way, then his hot flesh was on hers. Strong, muscled. She wanted to touch him, wanted to make certain he was alive and safe\u2014</p><p>But he pushed her back, easing her down onto the mattress. His mouth tore from hers and he licked his way down her throat.</p><p>He\u2019d almost died.</p><p>He bit her collarbone. A light nip. \u201cThat bastard was gunning for us both.\u201d His tongue caressed her wound. His hands traced down her body. Lucas\u2019s fingers cupped her breasts, made the nipples ache for his touch. His tongue.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I saw . . .\u201d Now his mouth was near her breast, and his breath feathered over the sensitive flesh. \u201cWas you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands caught his shoulders. Her nails dug into the skin. \u201cYou were leaving me.\u201d The accusation slipped from her.</p><p>He pushed her legs apart. Settled his hips against her. \u201cNo damn chance.\u201d</p><p>He took her breast into his mouth. Sucked and licked and the need heated her blood.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . ah, Lucas!\u201d She was wet for him, already. And he was hard for her. The length of his cock pushed against her sex, not entering her, not yet. \u201cYou . . . scared me.\u201d An admission that cost her, but the words were true. When he\u2019d been slipping away, she\u2019d been terrified. Not because her protector was gone. Not because she\u2019d have to face Rafe alone. But because I was losing Lucas.</p><p>He pressed a hot kiss to the curve of her belly. \u201cI heard you.\u201d He glanced up at her, his dark hair tousled, lines of lust etched on his face. Lust and . . . fury? \u201cI heard you calling me in hell.\u201d</p><p>His fingers curled over her thighs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>Then he put his mouth on her sex. His tongue brushed over her folds, tasted her, then drove deep. Sarah\u2019s body jolted as pleasure flooded through her. His thumb pressed on her clit, thrumming the nub, and she buried her fingers in his thick hair. \u201cLucas!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ease up. Just kept taking and stroking and\u2014oh, damn his tongue\u2014she came against his mouth.</p><p>He licked her while she came. Then he rose above her. His eyes watched her every move.</p><p>One thrust sent him balls-deep into her. The ripples from her climax still shivered through her and her sex squeezed him.</p><p>Then he withdrew. Drove deep. She wrapped her legs around him and let her nails sink into his skin.</p><p>Her hips arched toward him. Faster, faster. Harder. His gaze burned into hers. Strength and fury. Life. Not the cold whisper of death she\u2019d felt in the dark hours of night.</p><p>Life.</p><p>Lucas.</p><p>The climax hit her, stealing her breath, and Sarah opened her mouth to scream. Lucas kissed her, thrusting his tongue into her mouth just as he plunged into her body. He erupted inside of her, his body shuddering against hers. She held him as tight as she could with arms, hands, and legs, not wanting to let him go. Not wanting the pleasure to end.</p><p>The rasps of their breath filled the air. His heartbeat drummed against her, and the beat as fast and wild as her own. After a moment, his head lifted slowly, and he stared down at her with a gaze she couldn\u2019t read. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sarah licked her lips and tasted him. \u201cLucas . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you FBI?\u201d</p><p>Not the sweet, after-sex words she\u2019d hoped to hear.</p> <p>He withdrew from her body, a long, sensual glide of flesh that had aftershocks trembling through her.</p><p>\u201cAre you FBI, Sarah?\u201d</p><p>No way this was going to end well. Naked, sated, she stared up at Lucas and gave him the truth. \u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>Marie Dusean stared out of her window, watching the sun rise over the sky, its fingers already like blood on the day. Her body ached. Too many years. Too many lost lives. Too many souls that called to her.</p><p>She stared at the sun and knew what would come for her. But it was okay. Marie feared no man. She didn\u2019t fear Death, either. Why fear what you controlled?</p> <p>But she would regret. She would miss.</p><p>Belle fille. She\u2019d miss the girl so.</p><p>Her guards were leaving. Drifting away with the daylight. What was the point in them staying? More bloodshed? No. Enough of hers had died already. She wouldn\u2019t lose more souls.</p><p>She stared at the sun and waited.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Lucas rolled out of the bed. He stalked forward and grabbed a pair of jeans. \u201cYou were playing me. You think I don\u2019t know about the Feds and their damn extermination list?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been on that list since I was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not on the list anymore.\u201d She could give him that, at least.</p> <p>He whirled on her.</p><p>Okay, maybe that hadn\u2019t been the right thing to say.</p><p>\u201cYou were sent to take down the wolves.\u201d Not a question. His hands clenched into fists. The jeans hung low on his hips. His body tightened with fury. \u201cThat bastard was right, you were sent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year ago, we found the first body.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t talk about death and hell while she was naked. Sarah didn\u2019t know where her clothes were or who\u2019d taken them, so she rose from the bed slowly, trying to hide the quiver in her knees. Her body still ached from the sex, but she wouldn\u2019t show that, either. She grabbed the sheet, wrapped it around her, toga-style, then faced him.</p><p>His brows had shot down low. \u201cBody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Arizona. A man. The poor guy\u2019s throat had been ripped out. At first, we thought it was just a random killing, but then the other body turned up. A month later, just when the full moon rose again.\u201d Maybe the words came out too fast, but she needed to tell him everything. If he told her to walk, she would, but it was time she revealed all the secrets she\u2019d been carrying. \u201cThe local papers started dubbing the killer as The Werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Right. \u201cThe Other world doesn\u2019t need attention like that.\u201d Her job had been to make sure no paranormals attracted that kind of heat. A low profile equaled humans and paranormals who continued to exist semi-peacefully together. A big supernatural coming out party\u2014well, that equaled hell. Humans were too biased against their own kind. No way would they all take to monsters with open arms.</p> <p>His shoulders rolled. \u201cA shifter was killing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling only humans. Every month, he left another body.\u201d Those dead haunted her. \u201cOur crime-scene guys measured the cuts, found trace evidence on the victims and we knew we were after a wolf shifter.\u201d At first, the crime-scene guy had thought he\u2019d found dog hair on one of the vics. That had been the evidence they needed. Not dog hair. Close, but . . . \u201cWe thought a Lone was hunting.\u201d</p><p>Lones were the wolves who\u2019d been forced out of the relative safety of the pack. The wolves who\u2019d be most likely to have a psychotic breakdown. They were the ones with the sharpest blood hunger, the fiercest rage. Their beasts were too strong, they needed\u2014</p><p>\u201cI was Lone for six years.\u201d</p><p>She knew that. \u201cBut now you\u2019re alpha.\u201d The only Lone who\u2019d ever come back. That was one of the many reasons he\u2019d been watched by the FBI.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alpha only because I clawed and bit my way through the bodies to claim the pack.\u201d</p><p>And he had killed. She knew that. Pack justice. Pack was brutal. Wild. But for the wolves, it could be all that kept them sane.</p><p>She cleared her throat. Finish it. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any Lones in the area near the kills. There was a pack, but . . . no Lones. So I was sent in.\u201d Because she hadn\u2019t believed they were truly looking for a Lone. The prey was always different\u2014men, women, all races, all ages. But the location had been centered around Fallen, Arizona. Right around the home of Rafe\u2019s pack.</p><p>He laughed. A rough, bitter sound. \u201cLet me guess. When you went into the pack, no one knew you were a charmer. You went in, spied in their minds, and tried to find your killer.\u201d</p><p>That had been what Rafe wanted him to believe. She came into my pack, seduced me, used me, because her mission was to take down my wolves.</p><p>Rafe was a very good liar.</p><p>\u201cRafe knew exactly who and what I was.\u201d How else would she have gotten into the pack? \u201cRafe knew that I was a charmer, and he wanted to use my power. He came to me.\u201d And she\u2019d been so stupid. \u201cHe found me at the FBI. He knew about the killings and he said he wanted them stopped before his pack was forced to leave the area.\u201d</p><p>The tension in the room was so thick it seemed to suffocate her. Sarah tried to suck in a deep breath of air.</p><p>Lucas just watched her. \u201cI\u2019m guessing Rafe wasn\u2019t on the extermination list? Not if he just waltzed into the FBI office.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019d\u2014he\u2019d never hurt anyone. Always kept a low profile. He\u2019d pulled together his own pack, and he\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas lifted a hand, stopping her. \u201cRight. Got it. The fucking upstanding citizen came to you because he wanted the killings stopped.\u201d</p><p>He really had seemed upstanding, at first.</p><p>\u201cHow long was it,\u201d Lucas asked. \u201cBefore you found out Rafe was behind the kills?\u201d</p><p>Too long.</p><p>The wild, musky scent of the wolf teased Marie\u2019s nose. She pulled her shawl closer. She was always cold, even in the summer. Death stood too close to her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look back over her shoulder. Just kept staring at the sun. Not so bloody anymore. Almost . . . beautiful. Parts of the world were rather nice to look at.</p><p>Others weren\u2019t. She\u2019d seen it all in her ninety-three years. War. Famine. Hope.</p><p>Horror.</p><p>Time to let it all go.</p><p>She began to chant softly, whispering so carefully. She\u2019d learned the words at her mother\u2019s knee. Had passed them down to her darling Carline, only to see her only daughter die at the hands of a vampire.</p><p>Vengeance had come.</p><p>Vengeance always came.</p><p>\u201cRafe had taken a new wolf into his pack. A guy, barely eighteen, named Sean Walker.\u201d Wide smile, dark eyes\u2014his image flashed before her. He\u2019d seemed so nice, so normal, then he\u2019d shifted into a wolf and she\u2019d caught the darkness in his mind. Seen the flash of bodies and the pool of red. \u201cHe\u2019d been making the kills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy knew you were a charmer and he let you close enough to see his thoughts?\u201d Doubt hung heavy in Lucas\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cRafe\u2014Rafe brought me in as his companion, he didn\u2019t tell the others\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered. \u201cThat was your cover?\u201d</p><p>Being Rafe\u2019s lover. A lie that had become truth. Her chin lifted. She wouldn\u2019t apologize. She\u2019d made a mistake\u2014like Lucas\u2019s hands were lily-white. \u201cSean didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said instead. \u201cAll of the pack changed around me at some point. Sean\u2014when he shifted, I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you do?\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered. \u201cI reported to my boss at the FBI. Special Agent Anthony Miller is the leader of our task force. I told him, and then he told Rafe.\u201d She\u2019d followed the chain of command, thinking it meant something.</p><p>But Miller had already known how Rafe would deal with Sean . . .</p><p>\u201cPack justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hadn\u2019t realized how brutal or how swift it would be. Two wolves, fighting to the death. But no news coverage. No nosey reporters to deal with. Just a quiet end for a murderer\u2014at least, that\u2019s what Anthony had thought he\u2019d get. \u201cRafe . . . Rafe killed Sean.\u201d</p><p>The FBI had believed the murders were over then. Six dead. Peace for the victims, finally.</p><p>\u201cThen you and Rafe got close.\u201d She could easily hear the fury underscoring Lucas\u2019s words.</p><p>Fury and . . . jealousy.</p><p>For a moment, her lashes lowered. Rafe had understood her. Seemed to, anyway. After years of being on the outside, not having anyone who understood other than her grandmother, he\u2019d been a temptation for her.</p><p>Sarah forced herself to meet Lucas\u2019s gaze. She\u2019d kept a lot from him, afraid he wouldn\u2019t help her fight Rafe. Trust has to start somewhere.</p><p>She was already in too deep with Lucas. She\u2019d realized that when his blood covered her and his eyes wouldn\u2019t open. The terror had almost choked her.</p><p>No going back now. \u201cI never knew my father. He cut out of town long before I was born. And my mother wasn\u2019t a charmer. Or, if she was, she never found an animal that connected with her. She didn\u2019t like\u2014\u201d</p><p>Monsters.</p><p>Sarah cleared her throat. She wouldn\u2019t say that because Lucas wasn\u2019t a monster. \u201cMy mother wanted me to be normal.\u201d Her shoulders lifted, then fell. \u201cThe problem was that I never felt normal.\u201d The little house in suburbia hadn\u2019t been her.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was six,\u201d she told him, her voice quiet, \u201cI took a field trip to the zoo.\u201d It had been her first visit to see the animals. So many animals. So many cages. \u201cWhen the wolves started talking to me, I thought everyone could hear them.\u201d But her friends had laughed at her. Her teacher just said she had a vivid imagination.</p><p>And the wolves had kept talking.</p><p>Sarah swallowed. \u201cAs soon as I got off the bus that afternoon, I told my mom. The wolves had made me feel so good\u2014like they knew me. I told my mom,\u201d she said again, \u201cbecause I was sure she\u2019d believe me.\u201d The wolves liked me, mommy. I could hear them whispering in my head. They\u2019d\u2014</p><p>Her mom had paled as she yanked Sarah away from the bus and away from the other laughing kids.</p><p>Don\u2019t ever talk about the wolves again, Sarah! Do you hear me? Don\u2019t mention them, and Dear God, stay away from them.</p><p>The floor groaned beneath his feet. \u201cI\u2019m guessing she didn\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelief wasn\u2019t the problem. My mom knew about the Other, she just wanted her daughter to be normal.\u201d And really, she knew now that her mother hadn\u2019t been asking for so much.</p><p>\u201cNormal\u2019s over-rated,\u201d he said, watching her closely. Did he realize how important this was? She\u2019d never told anyone else about her past.</p><p>Just Lucas.</p><p>You can trust me.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stay away from the wolves. No, I didn\u2019t want to stay away. I snuck back to see them. Stole money from my mom and took one of the city buses back to the zoo.\u201d She\u2019d been terrified the whole trip, but she\u2019d needed to see the wolves once more because echoes of their voices kept playing in her head. They\u2019d been magic, and she\u2019d wanted that magic so badly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did your mother do?\u201d</p><p>She blew out a hard sigh. \u201cI scared her to death. I know I did.\u201d Now. \u201cShe found me there. I was standing in front of the wolves.\u201d She could still remember the cold steel of the metal railing. Her fingers had wrapped around it so tightly as she stared at the three wolves who\u2019d come to talk to her.</p><p>Mommy, the wolves like me! They don\u2019t like being here, though, but they like me! She\u2019d turned to her mom, smiling, not even worrying that her mother would be angry with her for sneaking away. They say they want to leave. They don\u2019t like it when the people come and watch, they want to run, to\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhen she pulled me away from the wolves, she was crying.\u201d It had been the first time she\u2019d ever seen her mother cry. \u201cThen the wolves started howling, snarling, trying to get out\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas pulled her against his chest. Just . . . held her and it felt so good. But, then, Lucas had seemed right from that first moment, even when he was the one in the cage. \u201cThey were trying to defend you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey got tranqed.\u201d She\u2019d never forget their cries as the darts hit them. Please, mom, stop them! Don\u2019t let the men hurt the wolves. The wolves need me\u2014</p><p>Never say that again, Sarah Belle King! Never! Her mother had run faster. Run so fast as she yanked Sarah away from the wolves.</p><p>Screams and howls had followed them as Sarah and her mother ran from the zoo. For months after that, those same screams and howls had filled her nightmares.</p><p>Her mother had still been crying when they finally made it out to their old station wagon.</p><p>I want the wolves. She\u2019d whispered that as her mom buckled her into the car with shaking hands.</p><p>\u201cAfter we left . . .\u201d She lifted her head and looked into his eyes. \u201cShe said that if I told anyone the wolves talked to me, then someone would come and take me away. She said people would think that I was crazy and that I\u2019d be locked up.\u201d I\u2019ve seen it before. It\u2019s not happening again. Her mother\u2019s tearful words. Stay away from the wolves.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t the first charmer in the family,\u201d he guessed, voice gruff, but the hands that held her were so gentle.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her lips twisted into a wan smile. \u201cA week later, she took me to visit my grandmother.\u201d Her visit to see Grandma Belle. \u201cGrandma Belle lived in a big hospital. There were bars on all the windows, and guards who watched everyone too closely.\u201d</p><p>Do you want to live here? Her mother\u2019s question. Sarah had been scared of the men in white uniforms. The men who watched Grandma Belle and the others every moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Needles, screams\u2014they\u2019d followed her out of the hospital just like the howls of the wolves had followed her from the zoo.</p><p>She pulled away from him. Faced Lucas with her chin up. \u201cAfter that, I didn\u2019t mention wolves to my mother again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world can be too damn hard on those who are different.\u201d</p> <p>He would know.</p><p>\u201cI pretended to be normal for years.\u201d But she\u2019d never really fit in. \u201cWhen I was seventeen, my mom died in a car accident. A head-on collision.\u201d So fast, so brutal. The other driver had been drinking. He\u2019d slammed into her mother\u2019s car when she was driving home from work at the diner.</p><p>The normal life she\u2019d wanted so badly had killed her\u2014and Sarah had been left alone.</p><p>\u201cIs that when you stopped pretending to be normal?\u201d She gave a brief nod. \u201cA few years after that . . .\u201d After bouncing around, living on the streets, struggling to survive, \u201cI was arrested for shoplifting.\u201d The luckiest break she\u2019d ever caught. \u201cBut it turns out the cop who caught me wasn\u2019t normal either.\u201d That had been the beginning. \u201cHe got me straight. Gave me direction, told me that I could make a difference in the world.\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019d introduced her to Anthony Miller, the FBI\u2019s go-to guy for the paranormal.</p> <p>She licked her lips. Slipping into the past just sucked. Too much pain waited there. \u201cWhen I worked with Rafe . . .\u201d Hell, this had been why she dragged up her past, to make him understand about the other wolf, so there was no stopping now. \u201cHe made me feel like I belonged. For the first time, I wasn\u2019t an outsider.\u201d She\u2019d been weak. Ready to fall. \u201cYou know what happened after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did it end?\u201d he asked, eyes narrowed. \u201cWhen did you find out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Rafe was a lying killer?\u201d she finished. \u201cMore dead bodies turned up. Only they weren\u2019t found near Fallen. They were discovered one state over. And Rafe made a mistake.\u201d A deadly one. \u201cHe shifted in front of me.\u201d</p><p>Just once. Rafe learned from his mistakes.</p><p>\u201cHe shifted and when I touched his mind, I saw the blood.\u201d The man she\u2019d been sleeping with\u2014he was the killer she\u2019d sought. \u201cHe ordered Sean and the others to attack humans. It was all his idea. His plan. His big game.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all it had been. Just a game. A hunting game.</p> <p>\u201cI think he planned to kill me. I know he did.\u201d Those brown eyes had locked on her and a growl broke from his lips. \u201cHe charged at me, but\u2014\u201d She stopped, body tensing.</p><p>Lucas caught her chin and tipped her head back. \u201cThis where you make your other big confession? Where you tell me that you can\u2019t just read the minds of wolves, but you can control us, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to confess, is there?\u201d He\u2019d had first-hand experience. \u201cNot when you already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as fuck do.\u201d His jaw clenched. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for your little command in my head, Caleb would be dead.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d gone right for the other wolf\u2019s throat. \u201cWe needed to find out why.\u201d Was Caleb even still alive? \u201cHe was so close to you, we needed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou controlled me.\u201d He cut across her words. \u201cControlled Piers.\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cDane?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>His hand fell away. \u201cAnd what about my brother? He told me he didn\u2019t remember launching at Hayden, just flying through the fucking window.\u201d</p><p>She forced her stare to hold his. \u201cI wanted him to take the coyote out.\u201d Her fault. She hadn\u2019t thought past the fear. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean . . . Hayden was coming at me, and I just wanted Jordan to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo help you,\u201d he repeated, the words a dark rumble of sound. \u201cYou traded my brother\u2019s life for yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d Hell, hadn\u2019t she? \u201cI\u2019m still not used to it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I could control wolves, not until I stopped Rafe from sinking his teeth into me.\u201d Stop! Get the hell away! Her wild psychic shout. Rafe had frozen, his eyes wide and startled. Then he\u2019d flown back across the room, like a puppet on a string, snarling and growling the whole time. But he hadn\u2019t been able to attack her.</p><p>That had been the first time she\u2019d used her power, but not the last. Once she\u2019d realized what she could do, she\u2019d started to practice. To try and control her newfound strength by working on the wolf shifters who crossed her path.</p><p>I didn\u2019t practice hard enough.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to hurt Jordan.\u201d Her shoulders sagged. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could believe you.\u201d His drawl was mocking.</p><p>\u201cBut, babe, you\u2019ve been lying to me since day one.\u201d</p><p>Half-truths. White lies. Lies of omission. When had she become so good at deceit? Before or after she joined the FBI? Before. I lied for years, pretending to be normal. Lying was all I knew. \u201cI\u2019m a charmer. Rafe wants me dead. He wants you dead. All of that is true. I left the FBI shortly after Sean was killed. I\u2019m not an agent anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are they covering your ass?\u201d</p><p>She knew he was talking about the detective\u2019s death. Damn Rafe. Sarah exhaled. \u201cI suspect they\u2019re covering because they want me back. My ex-boss made contact with me right before I got into town.\u201d That was why she\u2019d been late. Miller had held her up when he\u2019d caught her at that gas station. Of course, he\u2019d known exactly where to find her. He\u2019d probably tracked the GPS on her phone.</p><p>But Miller hadn\u2019t offered protection. Oh, no, because there wasn\u2019t a human safe house strong enough to protect her, not from a whole wolf pack. But the FBI had wanted something . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want?\u201d Lucas turned away.</p><p>\u201cHe wants the killings to stop. Rafe has plans\u2014he\u2019s attracting attention, a national manhunt is going to be launched soon if we don\u2019t stop him. Everyone will know about The Werewolf. The kills will come faster, the coyotes he has in his pocket will help him. The dead will fill every airwave, every newspaper\u2014\u201d</p><p>He glanced back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe has plans,\u201d she said again softly. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t matter what the FBI\u2019s motives are, we have to stop him. If we don\u2019t, he\u2019ll just keep killing. He\u2019ll come after me, after you, and he\u2019ll keep killing.\u201d</p><p>The floorboards creaked behind Marie. Those soft creaks were the only sounds that the wolf shifter made. Marie didn\u2019t jump. She was far too old and experienced for that. Her fingers smoothed over her necklace. The delicate ruby ring hung on the thick chain, always resting close to her heart. \u201cYou came faster than I thought,\u201d she softly said.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t look at him. Her eyes were going hazy again, the sun blurring and she liked that. But if she looked at him\u2014she\u2019d see the evil too clearly. And that would not be the last sight she had.</p><p>\u201cYou saved the fucking bastard,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cYes, Rafael, I did.\u201d She\u2019d helped him once. Her mistake. But he\u2019d been young, grieving, his father lost to fangs and claws. Her mistake.</p><p>But he\u2019d crossed her line then. Meant no harm.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until after she\u2019d helped him, after she\u2019d given the wolf within strength, that she\u2019d seen the glimmer of darkness. Darkness could hide easily inside a child. She hadn\u2019t possessed the will to kill him, not when he was so young.</p><p>What if she\u2019d been wrong? Her vision had failed twice in her life.</p><p>Once with her daughter, Carline.</p><p>She began to rock slowly, back and forth. The cold whispered over her skin. \u201cI know why you killed Maxime and Helene.\u201d The poor souls that had come to her. Lost, forced back from the grave. Only dark magic could pull the souls back.</p><p>Should have been left at peace. Some people had a hard time letting go.</p><p>Carline. Hadn\u2019t she been tempted to raise her baby? But her strength lay in another area.</p><p>Whereas her belle fille . . . Her grand-daughter Josette had surprised her. Saddened her.</p><p>\u201cGood fucking deal for you.\u201d More creaks filled the air as he stalked closer. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t keep me out this time, could you? Guess I\u2019m stronger than your red dust now.\u201d</p><p>No, not stronger. She\u2019d left the line open. He wouldn\u2019t come away from this deed unscathed. Fool.</p><p>\u201cYou should have let the wolf die, mambo.\u201d</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t have served her purposes. If Simone had died, then the charmer wouldn\u2019t owe her.</p><p>His fingers rose, and his claws curled over her shoulder. I won\u2019t see him. But she could feel the press of darkness, those same whispers that had been in the boy, only they were screams now. Screams from all the dead he\u2019d taken.</p><p>\u201cTell me how you brought Simone back. You don\u2019t touch the Dark. He should have been a rotting corpse. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used something you can\u2019t understand.\u201d Something he\u2019d never grasp. \u201cSacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you kill a fucking chicken?\u201d His rough laughter grated in her ears.</p><p>He dared to mock her? Her faith? Her power?</p><p>No one mocked Marie Dusean.</p><p>See him.</p><p>She turned in his grasp. The fog parted for her, and she saw the monster staring down at her. \u201cDeath\u2019s comin\u2019 for you, boy.\u201d Her voice rolled with the promise. \u201cYou can beg, you can plead, but in the end . . . he\u2019ll have you.\u201d</p><p>His claws sliced across her throat. Marie didn\u2019t feel the pain. She was already gone. Gone into the fog that waited. Welcomed.</p><p>He\u2019ll have you.</p><p>Her necklace fell to the floor, severed by a wolf\u2019s claws. The ruby ring slipped off the chain, then became lost in the blood.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cWill you still help me?\u201d Sarah whispered. \u201cNow that you know I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBait from the Feds?\u201d Lucas finished, voice biting, and he saw her flinch. Dammit, he didn\u2019t want to attack her. He wanted to yank her back into his arms, hold her tight but\u2014</p><p>Pack law. She\u2019d deceived not just him, but his whole pack. Controlled them. Wolves didn\u2019t like being controlled by others.</p><p>Might as well be a fucking mental cage to them.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Sarah said, voice tight. \u201cI don\u2019t work for them anymore.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t believe her. Sarah\u2019s ex-boss had contacted her right before she came to LA, and he was supposed to buy that the guy hadn\u2019t brought her back into the fold?</p><p>Lucas knew he was on the FBI\u2019s extermination list\u2014and he didn\u2019t trust those Bureau bastards not to set him up . . . and not to use their perfect bait to do it.</p><p>Shit. From the beginning, he\u2019d known she\u2019d held back. He\u2019d known better than to trust her, but damn if he hadn\u2019t started to let his guard down for her.</p><p>Now that he knew about her past, it made him want her all the more. She\u2019d been so strong, keeping her talents hidden from the world, then struggling through life on her own.</p><p>But the pack . . .</p><p>Sarah came closer to him. Her hands pressed to his chest. \u201cWe want the same thing. To stop Rafe. Once he\u2019s dead . . .\u201d</p><p>What? She\u2019d slip away? Get out of his life? No.</p><p>One delicate shoulder lifted. \u201cThen you can tell me to hit the road, okay?\u201d</p><p>But what if he couldn\u2019t let her go? The woman didn\u2019t realize just how thin his control was with her. \u201cYou\u2019re a dangerous weapon, Sarah King.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened a bit. Such green eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell me . . .\u201d He breathed in her scent. \u201cAre you still lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted, could you control me right now? Get me to do anything you wanted?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, a quick flash of pink tongue that made his idiotic cock twitch. Always want her. \u201cN-no . . . I told you before. I can\u2019t read your thoughts when you\u2019re in human form\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really the same thing, is it?\u201d He broke through her words. His heart thundered too fast and he knew she felt the wild beat. But when he was close to her, he was wild. Need more. \u201cNot talking about reading thoughts. I\u2019m talking about control.\u201d He waited a beat. \u201cCan you control me now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that, babe? Wouldn\u2019t be the first time you were . . . ah . . . a bit unclear with me.\u201d</p><p>Her hands dropped. \u201cI tried to control Rafe when he was in human form. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d Anger fueled her own words. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not working now with you, or else you\u2019d be on your knees in front of me, telling me how sorry you are for being a jerk.\u201d</p><p>One brow lifted. \u201cA jerk?\u201d He\u2019d been called much worse. But the word still drove into his gut. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s been lying.\u201d Odd, that. He usually lied one hell of a lot, but . . . not to her.</p><p>While she spent all her time lying to him.</p><p>\u201cI stayed with you.\u201d She spun around, giving him her back. \u201cI made the deal with Marie. I was willing to trade everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>His body tensed at that. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t.\u201d He remembered the fire in his gut. The burn that lashed through his organs. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t.\u201d He could still feel it\u2014the whisper of cold, of death, sinking into his body.</p><p>She threw a glance back over her shoulder. \u201cI agreed to her trade.\u201d A rough laugh. \u201cHell, I don\u2019t even know what was happening. You were dying. She was chanting, asking me about binding with you.\u201d</p><p>No, hell, no. \u201cSarah, did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her body swung toward him. \u201cDid I what? Fight for your ungrateful self? Yes, I did. I\u2019m not all bad, you know, Lucas. I don\u2019t want you dead. I don\u2019t want Jordan dead. I just want\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lunged forward and grabbed her arms. \u201cDid she bind us?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>A hard rap shook the door.</p> <p>\u201cDid she?\u201d He gritted, his eyes only on her.</p><p>Sarah nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And he knew he was fucked.</p><p>The door swung open. \u201cAlpha, Caleb\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t glance at Dane. He\u2019d known the pack had recovered the wolf. Severely injured, barely alive.</p> <p>But barely was all they needed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awake. I don\u2019t know how long he\u2019s got, though.\u201d No emotion filtered through Dane\u2019s voice. Not like he was talking about a friend, a pack brother. Oh, yeah, he damn well was. The betrayal ate at Lucas.</p><p>Dane exhaled on a hard sigh. \u201cHe won\u2019t make it through the trial by pack.\u201d</p><p>Lucas was still staring at Sarah. He saw her pale. \u201cYou\u2014you would force him to face that?\u201d</p><p>A trial by pack. The same method Rafe had used to \u201celiminate\u201d the threat of Sean. When the pack was attacked, when a wolf crossed the line, the trial was to a wolf\u2019s surrender or to his death. If the wolf surrendered\u2014he lived, but would be banished from the pack.</p><p>If he fought to the end, either he killed the alpha . . . or died trying.</p> <p>\u201cDoes she go up, too?\u201d Dane asked, voice still flat.</p><p>Sarah tried to jerk back. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not pack. I get that you guys are pissed over the control thing\u2014but, dammit, I\u2019m not pack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you came to us for protection. We took you in.\u201d He didn\u2019t let her go. Couldn\u2019t. Because she hadn\u2019t just deceived him, she\u2019d used, controlled the whole pack. And the pack wanted their justice.</p><p>He had to give it to them.</p><p>\u201cDoes she go up?\u201d Dane repeated.</p><p>Lucas nodded. The man couldn\u2019t make this choice. The alpha had to lead the pack. Protect the pack from all enemies.</p><p>Even those from within.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sarah.\u201d He was.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll kill me.\u201d Were those tears in her eyes? \u201cYou\u2019d really let them\u2014\u201d She broke off, shaking her head, sending that thick mane flying. \u201cYou\u2019d make love to me and then, not ten minutes later, you\u2019d let them kill me?\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s footsteps thudded down the hallway as he left. But he was still close enough to hear every word they said.</p><p>Who could he trust these days? Suddenly, Lucas just wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>So he didn\u2019t speak. A teardrop streaked down Sarah\u2019s right cheek. Just one drop because she didn\u2019t let the other tears swimming in her eyes fall. \u201cYou\u2019re really not so different from Rafe, are you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The fuck he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Her shoulders straightened. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYour mistake. You\u2019ll regret this, Lucas Simone.\u201d</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>She brushed by him.</p><p>When he was sure Sarah was gone, he finally unclenched his fists. His claws were out. They\u2019d dug into his flesh. His blood dripped on the floor.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only blood that would spill. Not even close.</p><p>Pack law. It was the only law they had. Human rules didn\u2019t mean a shit. They were too easy to break. But pack . . . it was more than skin deep. They all had to follow the law. All.</p><p>Even the alpha.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let them see her fear. Sarah went into the back courtyard, her steps slow but sure. She kept her chin up and her gaze focused straight ahead. Those wolves wearing the bodies of men wouldn\u2019t see how scared she was.</p><p>Sure, they could probably smell the fear. Sweat trickled down her back as the group closed around her. And she was sure they could hear the frantic beat of her heart.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. She\u2019d stare them down. She\u2019d be ready for what came.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Dane\u2019s whisper in her ear. His shoulder bumped against her. He was on her right. Piers on her left. Jordan stood in front of her. Two more wolves, she didn\u2019t even know who the hell they were, had come up behind her.</p><p>\u201cI hear that you\u2019ve got some secrets,\u201d Jordan murmured. The sun beat down on them. They were protected from prying eyes by the thick walls that surrounded the back of the compound. So if they wanted to shift and attack out there as wolves, no one would see.</p><p>No one would stop them.</p><p>Did I really think I\u2019d be safer here?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for you to get hurt.\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice was clear. \u201cI sent the order out to stop him, but I didn\u2019t consider the risk to you.\u201d She hadn\u2019t anticipated the guy would fly through a freaking window. The power of suggestion. Too strong. She\u2019d remember that.</p><p>For next time.</p><p>Warm, hard fingers curled around her shoulder. Sarah didn\u2019t look back. No need. She\u2019d know Lucas\u2019s touch anywhere. The bastard.</p><p>\u201cCaleb first.\u201d His command.</p><p>The other wolves eased back.</p><p>What? A reprieve for her?</p><p>Jordan turned and stalked toward the small guardhouse in the back. The guy didn\u2019t even seem to be limping from his injuries today. The power of the wolf. If only she had some of that power right then.</p><p>Jordan shoved open the door. Piers went in first. Then Dane. Sarah hung back. Tried to, anyway, but Lucas pushed her forward.</p><p>Caleb was on a bed. Michael stood guard near him. Caleb\u2019s eyes were open, the smoky stare on her. Blood had dried on his chest and near his mouth. \u201cLittle . . . charmer . . .\u201d He murmured. \u201cStill . . . alive, too?\u201d</p><p>His voice rasped at her, so weak. But his injuries didn\u2019t look that bad. And as a shifter, he should have healed by now.</p><p>Lucas stepped in front of her. \u201cWhy.\u201d An order.</p><p>She tried to slide around Lucas. He shoved her back, keeping her away from the injured shifter.</p><p>\u201cI fucking trusted you, Caleb. I brought you in when you had nothing.\u201d Lucas lunged forward and grabbed Caleb, jerking him out of the bed. \u201cThen you turn on me. Try to kill me.\u201d He shook Caleb, hard. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Caleb laughed, but Sarah heard the edge of desperation in the sound.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop him?\u201d Piers asked her, his breath blowing against her ear. \u201cYou can control us\u2014why the hell didn\u2019t you just stop him?\u201d</p><p>She saw Lucas freeze. He dropped the still-laughing Caleb and turned to lock his glittered eyes on her. \u201cYes, Sarah . . .\u201d He drew out her name slowly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou controlled me easily enough,\u201d Piers said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Disgusted, from Dane.</p><p>What? Now they thought she was working with Caleb? With Rafe? Jerks. What did a woman have to do to prove her loyalty? Other than risking her life for them. Been there, done that. So she\u2019d lied, more than once. But she\u2019d also fought for their sorry asses, and she\u2019d gone to the damn edge to save Lucas in the mambo\u2019s house. \u201cHe has a shield,\u201d she gritted from between clenched teeth. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get past it. I couldn\u2019t get to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could get to all of us?\u201d Piers pressed.</p><p>Now she was getting scared and pissed. \u201cWith barely a thought.\u201d</p><p>His eyes slit at that. What? What was he going to do? Force her to face the pack in a life-or-death battle? Already doing that.</p><p>Caleb had finally stopped laughing. Now he was wheezing. Wheezing?</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s different about him,\u201d she said, voice thoughtful, her eyes drifting to Lucas. \u201cI couldn\u2019t control his beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb\u2019s a hybrid,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLike Rafe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d Lucas\u2019s gaze watched her so carefully. \u201cHalf wolf,\u201d Lucas murmured, \u201cand half demon.\u201d</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Silence. The thick, hard silence that pressed down on a woman.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . knew?\u201d Whispered from Caleb.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Snarled from Piers as he lunged forward.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s hand shoved against Piers\u2019s chest as he held him back. \u201cWhat?\u201d His hand was on Piers but his stare had turned to Caleb. \u201cDid you really think you were so damn special? That you were the only hybrid wolf running around out there?\u201d</p><p>No, Sarah had learned of others like him while she\u2019d been at the FBI. There had been one incredibly powerful wolf/ demon hybrid in Atlanta who\u2019d almost taken the city to hell a while back.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s skin paled even more. As she watched, the gray bled away from his eyes until only demon black remained. No more pretending. No more glamour. \u201cYou . . . let me in . . . pack . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you had demon blood.\u201d Lucas shrugged. \u201cAt the core, you\u2019re wolf.\u201d A pause. \u201cOr you were.\u201d</p><p>Until he\u2019d betrayed the pack.</p><p>A demon. That would explain why she hadn\u2019t been able to get into Caleb\u2019s head. Demons, even the low-level ones, had psychic powers. In the Other world, demons were gifted with many powers. Low-level demons, those who ranged on the scale from one to three, could barely work most magic. They could do glamour spells, but little else. But the higher end demons, those with a power scale of seven or higher, those were the guys that humans truly needed to fear. They could make the phrase, \u201chell on earth\u201d come true.</p><p>But was Caleb a low-level demon? Or was he something much, much more powerful?</p><p>\u201cWhy would you help Rafe?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cWhat did he have on you?\u201d Because she knew the way Rafe worked. He loved to go after his prey\u2019s weaknesses.</p><p>\u201cNot a . . . damn . . . thing . . .\u201d Blood spilled from his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he shifted?\u201d Sarah pushed back her hair as she glanced at Lucas. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he healed by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t shift,\u201d Michael said, stepping forward. \u201cHe\u2019s tried. Several damn times, but he can\u2019t get a full shift.\u201d</p><p>Caleb screamed them, bucking in the bed as his body twisted and the veins bulged on his arms and chest.</p><p>Lucas braced his legs apart. \u201cYou\u2019re dying.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s face contorted. \u201cFucking . . . know . . .\u201d Caleb\u2019s claws burst from his fingertips, then vanished in an instant, leaving only bloody fingers behind.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Michael grabbed him and pinned him against the bed. Caleb was thrashing, screaming, snarling as he kicked out and arched on the bed.</p><p>The guy was acting like he was possessed. Just like she\u2019d seen in an old movie once with . . .</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>\u201cPoison.\u201d Her whisper had all eyes on her. All eyes but Caleb\u2019s. His black eyes had squeezed closed and bloody tears leaked down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucas crossed to her. \u201cYou know what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>Sarah swallowed. Thanks to the extermination list, she had a very good idea. \u201cHe dosed you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d There\u2019d been rumors about this particular mix back at the Bureau. And as she\u2019d learned, every rumor held some truth.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t answer. At this point, she wasn\u2019t sure he could. His vocal cords would be closing soon. \u201cBody control, vision, speech . . .\u201d That was the order of loss. If the dose was in his body too long . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is happening, Sarah?\u201d Lucas caught her arms and pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying.\u201d That was obvious enough.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison. I-I think a special batch made just for demons.\u201d All the supernaturals turned on each other at some point. Some feuds went past the skin, down through the bone and the magic. \u201cAt the Bureau, there was talk . . . an agent heard that some shifters created a brew a few years back. A mix that could destroy a demon,\u201d she swallowed, \u201cfrom the inside out.\u201d</p><p>But each demon reacted a little differently to the drug. Demons always reacted differently to drugs. With this brew, if the story was true, some had died instantly. Some had become comatose. Some had hung on, fighting for weeks, slowly wasting away. Others . . .</p><p>They\u2019d just had a few days.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cI think it\u2019s Angel\u2019s Dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel Dust?\u201d Piers echoed. \u201cWhat\u2014PCP? You\u2019re telling us that Caleb\u2019s strung out on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a little demon lesson for you.\u201d Her gaze darted down Caleb\u2019s twisting body. His skin was mottling, flashing bright red, then turning pale white. \u201cDemons don\u2019t react so well to drugs. Some of them get hooked with one taste, others can OD immediately. Demons and drugs don\u2019t mix.\u201d Which is why drugs were their deadliest weakness.</p><p>Some smart shifters had known that.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not strung out on PCP,\u201d she told them slowly, clearly. \u201cIt\u2019s Angel\u2019s Dust, a poison made for demons. The first batch . . . I heard it came from the blood of an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Dane said instantly.</p><p>\u201cRight, werewolf.\u201d She didn\u2019t glance at him. \u201cTalk about angels and demons has to be bullshit, right? I mean, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re staring at a demon or that you\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Lucas curled his fingers around her arms and lifted her onto her toes. \u201cHow do I fix him?\u201d</p><p>Here was the tricky part. \u201cIs that what you want? I thought you were going to let him die. Pack justice and all.\u201d Yes, her words had bite. Couldn\u2019t control that\u2014not when she was so scared and so damn angry. He\u2019d really let his pack turn on me?</p><p>Lucas\u2019s hold tightened a bit. Not enough to hurt. Just enough to let her know his control was thinner than it looked.</p><p>\u201cIf he dies, he can\u2019t tell me what I need to know.\u201d</p><p>No, and the guy was beyond talking right then. No words were coming from his lips, just blood.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s poison, then there\u2019s an antidote, right?\u201d Michael asked, his body rocking forward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not always. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I need the cure right now.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy. If it\u2019s Angel\u2019s Dust\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou just said it was,\u201d Piers fired, voice rough.</p><p>Sarah glanced over her shoulder at him. \u201cI said I thought it was. It looks like what I\u2019ve heard about an Angel\u2019s Dust poisoning.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to look back at Caleb, but she forced herself to. Damn. Agony etched deep lines into his face. \u201cNever seen a poisoning up close,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and her gaze zeroed back in on Lucas.</p><p>\u201cI need that cure.\u201d</p> <p>If only she had a cure to give him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find out about the Dust?\u201d Dane wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThere was an agent . . . he\u2019d been following a series of demon deaths. I saw some of his files at the FBI. Some demons who\u2019d been . . .\u201d On the list for death. \u201cThey were taken out before the Bureau got to them. The agent on the cases suspected Dust was used. The demons . . . they\u2019d attacked some bear shifters near Yosemite, took their pelts . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Piers snarled.</p><p>The absolute insult to a dead shifter\u2014take the pelt before the body shifted back to human form. That left the dead body twisted, malformed. A monster at death\u2019s gate.</p><p>\u201cHe heard about the Dust then, from some warlock named Skye.\u201d She\u2019d remembered the warlock. She always remembered names that could help her. But this part . . . \u201cThe agent also wrote that once ingested, he didn\u2019t know if there was a cure for a demon.\u201d</p> <p>No cure, just death.</p><p>\u201cBut Caleb\u2019s not just a demon.\u201d Lucas\u2019s fingers eased their hold. Caressed with a soft touch. A hard smile curved his lips. \u201cHe\u2019s also wolf.\u201d He turned away from her and stalked toward Caleb\u2019s heaving body. \u201cAt the core,\u201d he said again, \u201che\u2019s wolf.\u201d</p><p>But the wolf wasn\u2019t fighting then, and the demon was dying.</p><p>\u201cTime to let the wolf out to play,\u201d Lucas announced with a nod. \u201cGet it, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>Jordan. She\u2019d forgotten he was even there, but when she looked back, Jordan stood in the doorway, a silent shadow. \u201cWhat do you want him to get?\u201d she asked.</p><p>But Jordan was already leaving.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Dane whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving him the Balkans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be in control!\u201d Dane argued. \u201cHe\u2019ll just be wolf, he won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be wolf,\u201d Lucas said, \u201cand the wolf can heal.\u201d Balkans. Yes, okay, she knew the geographical area, but what did that have to do with saving the man\u2019s life?</p><p>\u201cWill he even be able to ingest it?\u201d Piers asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll take it,\u201d Lucas promised. \u201cEven if I have to shove it down his throat.\u201d His blazing eyes turned back to Sarah. \u201cTake her out, Dane.\u201d</p><p>Her knees locked. \u201cI thought you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t control him, Sarah. You said so yourself.\u201d Lucas\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cWhen the shift comes, the beast is going to take over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd humans, charmers\u2014they all smell like prey to us,\u201d Dane told her quietly.</p><p>Prey. Was that really what she was to them? To Lucas? Jordan came back, shoving open the door. He had a small vial in his hand. Some kind of clear liquid.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a white flower in the Balkans,\u201d Dane told her as he guided her back toward the door. \u201cAbout five hundred years ago, folks believed if you ate that flower, you\u2019d become a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Piers and Michael hauled Caleb up. Lucas caught his chin and pried open Caleb\u2019s bloody mouth. Then the alpha shoved the open vial past the snarling man\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cThey were half-right.\u201d Dane\u2019s breath blew against her ear. \u201cThe flower forced an instant shift in those who carried an animal inside. No stopping it, just fast, full on\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas threw the vial to the floor. It shattered. \u201cGet her out!\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s wasn\u2019t jerking anymore. He\u2019d gone still. Dead?</p><p>Then his bones began to snap. A howl tore from his throat.</p><p>\u201cGet her out!\u201d Lucas yelled again.</p><p>You all smell like prey.</p><p>Dane pulled her outside just as another howl shook the small guardhouse.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what happens,\u201d Lucas snarled, his voice roughening as the beast fought for control of his body. \u201cCaleb doesn\u2019t leave this room. He doesn\u2019t get near Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Piers still stood as a man, by Lucas\u2019s order. Lucas knew how delicate that shifter\u2019s control was. Now wasn\u2019t the time to test him.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t get by me,\u201d Piers vowed.</p><p>\u201cOr me.\u201d From Jordan.</p><p>Good to know, but Lucas didn\u2019t plan on letting Caleb get past him.</p><p>Already, the man\u2019s body was gone. The white wolf crouched on the bed, his eyes wild, his fangs bared. Ready to rip and attack at any moment.</p><p>Lucas let the change sweep over him. It was such a beautiful pain, savage and brutal, but the power of the beast was a heady addiction. One that had long ago worked under his skin.</p><p>He expected an attack from Caleb. It would have been smart for the other wolf to attack while he shifted. But Caleb just stood, body trembling, and watched. Waited.</p><p>The fire of the shift began to cool. Lucas stretched in his new body, feeling the pull of muscles, the tensile strength.</p><p>He stalked toward the bed\u2014and toward the waiting wolf.</p><p>You in there? He sent the question out, searching.</p><p>A breeze teased his nose. The scent of grass, of ocean, of . . .</p><p>Sarah.</p><p>The white wolf\u2019s nostrils flared and he launched off the bed, heading right for Lucas. Lucas twisted, but didn\u2019t let his claws touch Caleb. Not yet.</p><p>Poison.</p><p>Caleb had been loyal once. Lucas had called him friend. But if he had to, Lucas would kill him. He\u2019d killed other friends before.</p><p>But Caleb . . .</p><p>Get control, wolf. He snapped out the command in his mind. There was no mental link that he could find with Caleb. He just touched rage, fear, pain.</p><p>Get control, he fired again but the white wolf attacked him. This time, Lucas had to use his teeth. He caught the beast around the neck, held tight, then tossed Caleb across the room.</p><p>Not a good fucking way to heal.</p><p>The white wolf\u2019s ears flattened.</p><p>\u201cLucas, I sure as shit hope you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Piers muttered.</p><p>Yeah, he did, too.</p><p>The white wolf attacked once more, a hard, driving attack. Lucas met him head on, jaw snapping. He didn\u2019t want to kill the other wolf. He needed Caleb to heal. He needed to find out what the hell was happening, but\u2014</p><p>They rolled, twisted, and Caleb\u2019s claws dug into Lucas\u2019s side. He growled at the fiery burst of pain. Get control, Caleb. The shift should have pushed some of the poison out of his system, and if the man could just get control of the beast\u2014</p><p>Caleb broke away from him and sprang for the door.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Fraid not.\u201d Jordan stood before the door, arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting by me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas jumped onto the white wolf\u2019s back and as the snarls and growls burst from them both, the wolves crashed onto the floor.</p><p>Dane\u2019s shoulders were tense, his attention focused on the guardhouse. Sarah stood behind him, the sounds of battle seeming to echo in her mind. Her body ached because her muscles were locked so tight.</p><p>She swallowed and forced herself to speak. \u201cHow\u2019d you all find out about the Balkans?\u201d She\u2019d never heard of the plant, and if it could do what they said . . .</p><p>Dane didn\u2019t glance back at her. \u201cWe have our sources, too, Sarah.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cWe would have tried it on Lucas last night, but he had too much silver in him for it to work. The Balkans can\u2019t fight silver.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fisted.</p><p>\u201cYou should trust him,\u201d Dane said, his voice barely more than a whisper.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s breath stuck in her throat. \u201cLucas?\u201d Her brittle laugh blended with the snarls in the air. \u201cHe wants to put me up for a pack trial! You both do!\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cYou sacrificed for me.\u201d</p><p>She edged back a step.</p><p>\u201cAnd you could have let Lucas die at Marie\u2019s. I know how she works. You didn\u2019t have to agree to her trade. You could have just let him die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not who I am.\u201d</p><p>Glass shattered. Her gaze flew back to the small, two-room building. Through the broken window, she caught sight of the white wolf, jaws snapping as his eyes blazed at her.</p><p>Her left foot lifted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t back away,\u201d Dane snapped. \u201cYou know wolves like to chase their prey.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>She held herself perfectly still.</p><p>The wolf vanished.</p><p>Silence. Sarah didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking the battle was over. Silence had lied to her too many times before.</p><p>So they waited, not moving, as the minutes ticked by. Her heart pounded, her muscles ached, and she waited.</p><p>When the door finally opened, and Lucas stood in the entranceway, a pair of faded jeans hanging low on his hips, her breath heaved out.</p><p>But she knew the real battle, for her, wasn\u2019t over yet.</p><p>He came toward her, that bright blue stare on her. Piers and Jordan were at his back.</p><p>\u201cCaleb?\u201d Dane called out.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s head moved in a jerky nod. \u201cHe\u2019ll make it. He\u2019s out now, but when he comes back to us . . .\u201d A smile, cruel, deadly, lifted his lips. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell us all we need to know.\u201d</p><p>She knew the words were a promise.</p><p>She also knew the pack was now coming for her. Closing in. Trial by pack.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any place to run. Like she could run. Dane had been right. The wolves enjoyed the chase far too much.</p><p>No, there was nowhere to run. Surrounded. The wolves had her trapped.</p><p>Dane slipped away, no longer protecting her. He\u2019d left her open to attack. Fine. Not like she\u2019d really expected anything else.</p><p>She faced Lucas with her shoulders back and her chin up. \u201cI know how this works.\u201d</p><p>One black brow rose. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>When it came to pack, there might be a few surprises still out there\u2014like the Balkans\u2014but some things, a girl knew. \u201cTrial by pack. Two fight. The alpha and the accused.\u201d</p><p>The one accused of betrayal. Because only a betrayal could open a pack trial. The alpha was the judge. Death could be the verdict or . . .</p><p>He could spare his prey.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t shift.\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice held an edge of anger.</p><p>\u201cNot like that\u2019s my fault!\u201d Her head cocked to the right and she gave a shrug. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll just have to take me as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cIf I shift, you\u2019ll just control me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Damn straight she would. Not like she\u2019d let any wolf come for her throat. \u201cThen what do we do?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me, you want my blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>He moved then, in a flash, catching her arms and hauling her up against him. \u201cYour blood\u2019s not what I want,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Her hands caught his shoulders. Curled over the hot, hard skin. \u201cLucas?\u201d She saw the fury in his eyes, but . . . more. Need. Hunger. For me.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to the pack.\u201d His voice rang out. Loud and strong. \u201cControlled us. Risked us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI helped you!\u201d She yelled right back. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that matter? I went to trade myself for Dane. I fought for you! I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not fucking puppets,\u201d Piers snapped.</p><p>Her gaze collided with his.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas said softly. \u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Sarah swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t control us,\u201d Piers said. \u201cYou don\u2019t come into our minds, see the hell we carry\u2014\u201d</p><p>Because she had seen the darkness there.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and control us!\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s shoulders rolled, a fast ripple of movement. Sarah\u2019s gaze darted to the left. Jordan watched her with narrowed eyes.</p><p>Oh hell. This wasn\u2019t going to end well. Not at all.</p><p>\u201cThe fight will be in human form,\u201d Lucas said, his fingers easing their tight hold on her.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s heart slammed into her chest. She\u2019d never have a chance if they stayed human. Guess he\u2019d learned from Rafe. Staying human had been Rafe\u2019s technique, too. No, he\u2019d like to change a little, to let his claws out.</p><p>The better to attack.</p><p>Her scars seemed to burn.</p><p>Lucas turned his back on her. She felt the move like a slap right in the face.</p><p>\u201cThe fight\u2019s in human form.\u201d His voice was flat. \u201cFor pack justice.\u201d His hands were at his sides now, loose. But those claws were coming out.</p><p>She backed up a step.</p><p>The hiss of her name had Sarah\u2019s head shooting up. Dane stared at her, giving a small negative shake of his head. She froze.</p><p>\u201cWolves want justice. A challenge has been issued.\u201d Lucas lifted his hands, those claws gleaming now. \u201cSo if you want your justice, come and fucking get some.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>His hand flew out, caught hers. Held tight. His stare stayed on the others. \u201cBecause no one is gonna touch her, you understand? You want justice, then challenge me. I brought her in, and I\u2019m keeping her in.\u201d His voice deepened with every word, became more guttural. Hardly man, more animal. \u201cShe\u2019s pack. And she\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Sarah couldn\u2019t move right then. Hell, she could barely breathe. Because what Lucas was doing, for an alpha to declare an outsider to be pack, for him to say\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mine.</p><p>\u2014yeah, it was possessive, barbaric, but . . .</p><p>In the wolf world, it was also the equivalent of a marriage ceremony.</p> <p>\u201cYou want justice . . .\u201d His dark voice sent a shiver down her spine. \u201cDane, Piers, Jordan, and any other wolf lurking in the shadows . . . you want your justice, then you come at me for your pound of flesh.\u201d</p><p>For an instant, just one tense moment, his gaze locked on her. She saw the wolf looking back at her from the man\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou come at me,\u201d he said again. \u201cBecause from now on, I\u2019m standing between her and everyone else.\u201d</p><p>That was . . . Sarah swallowed. Sweet. Okay, not really sweet, a little brutal and stark but\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo come on.\u201d He pushed her behind him, shielding Sarah with his body. \u201cLet\u2019s see which of you gets to bleed first tonight.\u201d</p><p>Right. Sarah peered around his side. Now he was just talking big. Because the wolves wouldn\u2019t actually attack their alpha. They wouldn\u2019t\u2014</p> <p>Piers came at him first. His claws were out, his canines lengthening, and he lunged right for Lucas.</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t even have time to scream. Because about two seconds later, Piers was on the ground.</p><p>\u201cNext.\u201d</p><p>She stood on her toes now and glanced over his shoulder. Dane just smiled. \u201cAlpha, I don\u2019t have a problem with your mate.\u201d</p><p>Wait. Mate. Crap, that\u2019s exactly what Lucas had done, though, he\u2019d claimed her in front of his pack.</p><p>\u201cShe was willing to trade her life for mine.\u201d Dane sauntered around Lucas. Came to stand beside Sarah. \u201cI stand where I always stand. With you and now, with her.\u201d</p> <p>That lump in her throat was getting pretty big. So one guy had still wanted her hide. One stood by her side, and her lover\u2014</p><p>He was ready to take \u2019em all down for her.</p><p>It looked like her taste in men was definitely improving.</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d Lucas still had his claws out.</p><p>Piers had risen from the ground. He could charge again, but Lucas didn\u2019t seem too worried about that.</p><p>What would Jordan do? She\u2019d almost killed him. He would be the one with the most cause for an attack.</p><p>\u201cJordan, I never meant\u2014\u201d She began.</p><p>Dane grabbed her arm. \u201cNot right now. Really, not right now.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas\u2019s head whipped toward her.</p><p>Then she saw Piers and Jordan both spring forward. Both were attacking.</p><p>Jordan was coming after his own brother. She\u2019d done this, she\u2019d messed things up, and he was\u2014</p><p>Lucas\u2019s leg kicked, slamming into Piers\u2019s stomach, and just that fast, Piers crashed back to the ground. The alpha\u2019s hand flew out, and he caught Jordan right around the throat.</p><p>Jordan stared back at him. An almost mirror-image. But . . . less fury on the younger man\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cShe almost killed me,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>Sarah flinched.</p><p>Lucas dropped his hand. \u201cChallenge me, but you\u2019re not getting to her.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s gaze turned to her. Gold, deep. \u201cI remember what you said.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She couldn\u2019t speak, because right then, she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cI was lying in a pool of blood, my bones bursting through my skin, and those coyotes were coming to rip me apart.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s shoulders stiffened.</p><p>But Jordan smiled. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the first time Death tried to come for me, but I was sure wondering how the hell I\u2019d get away from him then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nearly didn\u2019t.\u201d The words slipped out. But she knew just how close he\u2019d come. She could still see those coyotes closing in for the kill.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one you want,\u201d he said. Voice so quiet she had to strain to hear him.</p><p>Lucas stepped forward, his hand rising once again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said.\u201d Jordan\u2019s lips curved in a crooked grin. \u201cEven as I was bleeding out, I heard you. \u2018Up here. I\u2019m the one you want.\u2019 And those bastards turned away from me, and they went after you.\u201d</p><p>Now all eyes were on her. She shoved her hair back. \u201cThey were after me.\u201d He was trying to make it sound like she\u2019d saved him. She\u2019d been the one to make him do the header through the window.</p><p>\u201cOne human, at least three coyotes.\u201d Jordan whistled. \u201cThem aren\u2019t very good odds, lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas growled. \u201cThey\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>She forced one shoulder to lift and hoped the shrug looked careless. \u201cI like to gamble.\u201d</p><p>She hated gambling.</p><p>\u201cAnd I was FBI. It\u2019s not like I was some kind of defenseless human.\u201d She\u2019d had training. Hand-to-hand, weapons\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re a human fighting a shifter, you are defenseless.\u201d This came from Dane.</p><p>But obviously, the guy didn\u2019t realize just how devious humans could be. He\u2019d have to watch that weakness.</p><p>\u201cYou challenged the coyotes and you saved my ass,\u201d Jordan drawled. \u201cNot quite even, not yet, but I have a feeling we will be. One day.\u201d That grin stretched a bit. \u201cEspecially since it looks like you\u2019ll be staying with us. Permanently.\u201d</p><p>Um, now about that\u2014</p><p>\u201cPiers.\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice snapped out. \u201cYou gonna keep dicking around or are you gonna attack like you mean it?\u201d</p><p>Piers was up again. His green eyes gleamed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? We both know you can kick my ass even when you\u2019re loaded with silver.\u201d His teeth snapped together. Such sharp teeth. \u201cI just wanted to get in a few swings.\u201d Then his gaze turned to Sarah and his head inclined. \u201cIf she stays out of my head, and I mean out, then we have no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you shift around me, I\u2019m in.\u201d Sarah spoke quickly, because she didn\u2019t want any more lies or half-truths with the pack. Not when they were offering her . . . everything.</p><p>Home. Safety. Pack.</p><p>Pack was forever.</p><p>\u201cI get a loud broadcast unless you\u2019re shielding, and Caleb\u2019s the only wolf who\u2019s ever shielded with me.\u201d Probably not the best guy to bring up right then.</p><p>Piers\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cIf you shift, I\u2019ll be in your head.\u201d She glanced around at the men. \u201cThis goes for all of you. It will be just like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of us,\u201d Lucas finished. \u201cIt will be just damn like you\u2019re a wolf. So think of her that way because she is one of us now.\u201d His gaze didn\u2019t leave her. \u201cBut you don\u2019t control us. You don\u2019t push your compulsions on my men or me.\u201d</p><p>Now this she could do. Try to do. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Piers repeated. \u201cHell, man, I was hoping for more of an I-swear-on-my-life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t push, I won\u2019t try to\u2014\u201d Sarah stopped talking because, quite suddenly, the wolves weren\u2019t focused on her anymore. They\u2019d turned as one toward the main house, faces intent, noses\u2014twitching?</p><p>\u201cVampire,\u201d Jordan breathed and there was hate in the word. Yeah, with his particular history, who could blame the guy?</p><p>But wait, vampire. Sarah\u2019s mouth got very dry, very fast. Vamps were her least favorite of all the supernaturals. They liked to play with their food way too much for her taste.</p><p>\u201cSulfur,\u201d Piers muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air . . . shit. It\u2019s them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamellia?\u201d Jordan asked, and he lunged forward, racing toward the house.</p><p>Wait, Camellia . . . that name was familiar. It clicked in her mind. When Jordan had been taken by the vamps, he hadn\u2019t been their only prisoner, they\u2019d also taken a girl. A shifter. Of course, Sarah had thought some of the rumors about the girl were bullshit because those stories had said the girl wasn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill two-spirit shifter.</p><p>The stories claimed she was a dragon.</p><p>Lucas ran after Jordan, roaring his name. The other wolves followed, quickly closing rank, and Sarah, well, she wasn\u2019t about to be left behind.</p><p>After all, pack stayed together.</p><p>She rushed after them, wishing she had a weapon. It was daytime, and any vamp would be a fool to attack now. All vamps were at their weakest during the day, even those born to the blood.</p><p>Lucas tackled Jordan. \u201cShe\u2019s not with them. Her scent\u2019s on him, but she\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Sarah saw the woman then. A small, dark-haired woman vaulted over the outer wall and began to stalk toward them. A man was at her side, tall, his blond hair gleaming. His body stayed close to the woman\u2019s as their steps shadowed each other.</p><p>\u201cThanks for that open invitation, wolf,\u201d the woman called out, her voice carrying easily. \u201cIt was nice not to have to fight my way past that new security of yours.\u201d</p><p>Security Sarah knew he\u2019d put out to protect them from Rafe.</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t really look like a vamp. Other than the paleness. She looked . . . pretty. Actually, the chick was freaking beautiful. High cheeks. Heart-shaped face. Not a blemish, wrinkle, or scar anywhere on her.</p><p>Vampire? Really?</p><p>Then Sarah caught sight of her fangs.</p><p>Vampire.</p><p>\u201cMaya.\u201d Lucas rose slowly and she noticed that he kept his body in front of Jordan\u2019s. And she also noticed the way he said the woman\u2019s name. With affection.</p><p>So those tales were true, too. Lucas did have a soft spot for the vamp who\u2019d hauled his brother out of hell one night. Sarah knew that hard kick in her gut was jealousy.</p><p>Maya lifted her right hand. Her fingers were curled in a fist.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d the man next to Maya said, his shoulder brushing hers.</p><p>\u201cWanna tell me . . .\u201d Maya bit out. \u201cWhy your scent was all over Marie Dusean?\u201d</p><p>Lucas just shrugged.</p><p>The vamp lunged forward.</p><p>But her man was faster. He grabbed her arms, yanking her back. Maya\u2019s hand opened, though, and she threw something at Lucas. Something small and hard, something that hit him in the chest and fell to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out when you\u2019re weak, Maya,\u201d Lucas said mildly.</p><p>She growled at him. Pretty good growl for a vamp.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes narrowed as she stared at the ground near his feet. What was\u2014</p><p>A ring.</p><p>Not just any ring.</p><p>She hurried forward.</p><p>\u201cSarah!\u201d Lucas caught her arm. But it was too late. She was in front of him, scooping up the familiar ring. Marie\u2019s ring.</p><p>Now it was time for her fingers to curl around the precious ruby. \u201cWhy do you have this?\u201d she asked, meeting the vampire\u2019s stare. Right then, they were a perfect fighting match. Almost human-to-human. She didn\u2019t need to be scared of Maya Black.</p><p>No matter what the whispers on the streets said.</p><p>One tough bitch to stake.</p><p>\u201cYou know that ring?\u201d Maya\u2019s attention sharpened on her.</p><p>Sarah nodded. \u201cDid she send you?\u201d And her palm was sweating around the ring. \u201cIs it time for me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The laughter stopped her. The hard, rolling laughter. Laughter edged with a fine coat of rage. \u201cMarie didn\u2019t send me,\u201d Maya said. \u201cMarie can\u2019t do anything right now.\u201d</p><p>The blond beside her dropped his hold.</p><p>Maya stepped forward. \u201cThe mambo\u2019s dead. I found her less than thirty minutes ago.\u201d Her gaze drifted past Sarah. \u201cHer throat had been slashed. That ring\u2014she wore it on her neck, always. But the bastard who killed her, his claws were so strong he cut through the gold chain, through the flesh, and he took her life away.\u201d</p><p>Another step forward. The man came with her, and the same rage was reflected on his face.</p><p>\u201cShe sent for me, but I got to her too late,\u201d Maya said, and there was pain in her voice. \u201cAll these years, and I got there too late.\u201d</p><p>The ring seemed heavy in Sarah\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI found her dead, lying in a pool of blood, and the stench of wolf was all around her.\u201d Maya shook her head. \u201cWe all know there\u2019s only one alpha in LA. One alpha, a bastard that I know saw Marie last night. And now she\u2019s gone, killed by a wolf\u2019s claws.\u201d</p><p>Sarah braced her body in front of Lucas. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t him.\u201d Maya smiled at her with a flash of vampire fangs. \u201cOf course. Let me guess, he was screwing you last night, right, human? Screwing you . . . so he couldn\u2019t have been killing her.\u201d</p><p>Half-right. The sex hadn\u2019t started until morning, and it hadn\u2019t been screwing. \u201cMarie helped us last night. I owe her.\u201d She opened her hand and glanced down at the ring. \u201cLucas wasn\u2019t in any condition to deal a killing blow when we were at her place.\u201d</p><p>More laughter, only this time, it came from the big blond and the scent in the air\u2014yeah, it did kinda smell like sulfur\u2014deepened. \u201cLady, trust me,\u201d he said, \u201cLucas Simone is always up for a killing blow.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. \u201cHe didn\u2019t kill her,\u201d she said, her own voice fierce.</p><p>Maya\u2019s gaze darted to the men who\u2019d gathered. When she looked at Jordan, her stare seemed to warm a bit. Only semi-arctic. \u201cThen which of these wolves,\u201d she wanted to know, \u201cis the one who\u2019s gonna bleed for attacking my mambo?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at the wrong wolves,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>Maya\u2019s gaze turned measuring. \u201cSorry if I don\u2019t believe you, but his scent . . .\u201d Her index finger pointed at Lucas. \u201cIs all over you. So I\u2019m guessing that makes you not exactly unbiased when it comes to the pack.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s back teeth clenched. \u201cThey aren\u2019t the only wolves in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d One black brow rose. \u201cGot a Lone on the loose? Then how come I haven\u2019t heard about him?\u201d Her legs braced apart, and, quick as a flash, she drew out a gun, one that was aimed right at Sarah. \u201cSilver bullets kill humans and wolf shifters real easy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sarah stared at the gun and didn\u2019t blink.</p><p>\u201cGet that fucking weapon off her!\u201d Lucas snarled.</p><p>But Maya shook her head. \u201cLike I said before, your scent\u2019s all over her.\u201d Her gaze tracked to the alpha. \u201cThat means you give a shit what happens to her, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me as your enemy, Maya,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cYou truly don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The blond\u2019s fingers touched Maya\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou were supposed to go easy,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd Marie was supposed to be damn well alive! She wasn\u2019t supposed to get slashed up by some mangy wolf!\u201d</p><p>At that, Lucas flew forward and shoved Sarah to the side. Dane instantly covered her, using his body to shield her.</p><p>Sarah twisted, glanced back, and saw that Lucas stood right in front of Maya. The gun pressed into his chest.</p> <p>\u201cYou think I killed her?\u201d His arms were up, his claws out. \u201cThen shoot. But then you . . . and the winged asshole . . . had better get the hell out of LA because my pack will be out for your blood.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t squeeze the trigger. \u201cWhy was your scent on Marie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she saved my life last night.\u201d A pause, then . . . \u201cAnd that\u2019s probably why she\u2019s dead today.\u201d</p><p>That gun shoved harder against his chest. \u201cWolf . . .\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s another alpha in town. One who\u2019s gunning for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d the vamp\u2019s guy said, head cocked.</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d Jordan stepped forward. Maya\u2019s attention swung to him. Sarah saw the vamp\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cLucas isn\u2019t lying to you. A bastard named Rafael Santiago is here, hunting him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHunting us,\u201d Piers added.</p><p>Jordan took another slow, gliding step toward the vampire. \u201cBelieve me if you believe no one else, Maya. It\u2019s not us you\u2019re after. It\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>But the gun wasn\u2019t dropping. \u201cI\u2019d like to believe you,\u201d Maya said and almost sounded like she did. \u201cBut no one would have crept up on Marie. She saw everything.\u201d Was that an echo of pain in her voice? \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have let a wolf she didn\u2019t know get to her, she wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she knew him,\u201d Sarah yelled out the obvious, still covered by Dane. \u201cShe knew Rafe, and if she\u2019s as strong as I think, she knew he\u2019d be the one to kill her.\u201d</p><p>Maya\u2019s hold on the gun finally eased, and in that second, Lucas\u2019s hand flew up and snatched the weapon away. Maya didn\u2019t spare him a glance. Her focus was fully on Sarah. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Lucas moved again, a gliding step, and blocked Maya\u2019s view of Sarah. \u201cConsider your entrance pass to my place revoked.\u201d</p><p>The blond man\u2019s shoulders tensed. \u201cI think she\u2019s Other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe smells human,\u201d the vamp muttered.</p> <p>Dane lifted Sarah back to her feet, but he stayed close.</p><p>\u201cNot a witch,\u201d the man said. \u201cNot a shifter . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrody, you don\u2019t need to know a damn thing about her!\u201d Lucas glared at the vamp\u2019s companion.</p><p>The guy, Brody, kept talking. \u201cDemon? I can never smell them and if she\u2019s using glamour . . .\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGet off my land,\u201d Lucas ordered, voice flat. \u201cAnd don\u2019t come back.\u201d Then he turned away and strode to Sarah\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me, wolf.\u201d Brody\u2019s hands were on his hips when he threw this out.</p><p>Sarah caught the narrowing of Lucas\u2019s eyes. Saw his lips move when he growled out, \u201cShifter bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t kill Marie,\u201d this came from Maya, \u201cif there\u2019s really another wolf in town . . .\u201d</p><p>He glanced back over his shoulder. \u201cThere is.\u201d</p><p>Maya edged forward. \u201cThen I want him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in line. I\u2019m taking that bastard out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he killed her, then I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s killed some of her followers.\u201d Dane was the one who dropped this bombshell. \u201cHe knew the mambo, and he\u2019s killed at least two of her people.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes widened. Why hadn\u2019t Dane said something sooner?</p><p>\u201cWe saw \u2019em last night.\u201d Now it was Piers who spoke up.</p><p>\u201cA woman from the South, and a Haitian male. Their throats had been ripped open.\u201d His lips tightened. \u201cI know a wolf\u2019s work when I see it.\u201d</p><p>The Haitian? But . . . he\u2019d been with her, he\u2019d talked to her. \u201cWhen?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cDid he kill them while we were inside\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dane shook his head. \u201cNo, they were dead long before that.\u201d His dark eyes met hers. \u201cLong before that.\u201d</p><p>Two ways. The memory of the mambo\u2019s voice drifted through her mind. Stop him before Death comes.</p><p>Oh, damn.</p><p>Or bring him back after.</p><p>Maxime.</p><p>\u201cShe had \u2019em under some kind of spell,\u201d Dane said. \u201cShe let \u2019em go right before we found the two of you on that table.\u201d</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t remember that part of the night. She didn\u2019t remember anything after the slash of the knife and Marie\u2019s dark promise.</p><p>He dies . . .</p><p>Then you die.</p><p>With those words, everything had gone straight to black. Sarah glanced at her arm. The wound was gone now. She didn\u2019t have any enhanced healing powers, but the wound had vanished far too quickly.</p><p>\u201cMarie said she didn\u2019t \u2018raise them\u2019 but that she was letting them go free.\u201d The words had Sarah\u2019s eyes lifting back to Dane. His jaw locked. \u201cOne minute, they were walking around, talking, the next\u2014we were staring at corpses that had been dead for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking zombies,\u201d Piers growled. \u201cHell, of all the Other . . . the dead belong in the ground.\u201d</p><p>Brody\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cWatch it.\u201d</p><p>Ah, right. Technically, Maya was dead. Well, undead. She would have died briefly before she was reborn as a vamp.</p><p>\u201cMarie never raised the dead. She didn\u2019t like to touch that power,\u201d Maya spoke softly, as if mostly to herself. \u201cShe said you never knew what you\u2019d bring back if you tried to raise the bodies of humans.\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t seem fazed to hear that zombies had been around them the night before.</p><p>Piers ran a quick hand over his face. \u201cThere\u2019s another who can raise them.\u201d</p><p>Maya\u2019s chin jerked up a notch. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can do it. You know she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because you can do something, it doesn\u2019t mean you will. Josette doesn\u2019t use the power, she doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Piers started laughing then, but there was no humor in that hard, mocking sound. \u201cMaya, you been playing house with your shifter too long, staying gone out of LA . . . you\u2019re missing some news, baby.\u201d He put his hands on his hips. \u201cGuess life in . . . where is it\u2014Maine?\u2014has made you soft.\u201d</p><p>The woman just looked angrier. \u201cNothing makes me soft. Don\u2019t make that mistake.\u201d</p><p>A faint grin still rode his lips. \u201cLittle Josie . . . she\u2019s been playing with power. Not keeping those hands of hers clean anymore.\u201d</p><p>Brody swore and Maya gave a hard shake of her head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>Maya spun away, her hand automatically reaching for Brody\u2019s. \u201cWe have to go.\u201d</p><p>Now she was running away?</p><p>No, not away. Running to something.</p><p>Probably to wherever this Josette/Josie was.</p><p>\u201cThe wolf is mine!\u201d Lucas shouted after them. \u201cDo you hear me, Maya? That kill is mine!\u201d</p><p>It was Brody who stopped and looked back. \u201cI let you have the last kill.\u201d Suddenly, his teeth looked longer, the skin on his arms darker. \u201cThis one\u2019s for Maya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I get to him first!\u201d</p><p>But Brody had spun away. He and the vamp disappeared, no, not disappeared, they just moved fast.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Lucas\u2019s eyes fixed on Sarah. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Other than an aching knee from where she\u2019d plowed into the ground, yes, she was fine.</p><p>She also still had Marie\u2019s ring. Sarah\u2019s fingers unfurled. The red of the ruby seemed so dark.</p><p>\u201cJosette.\u201d Lucas repeated the name, as if tasting it. \u201cShe\u2019s Marie\u2019s granddaughter. How the hell do you know anything about her and her power, Piers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause the lady is sexy as sin, and she\u2019s also taken to hanging out in the darker part of town.\u201d Piers flashed a wolf\u2019s grin. Too many teeth. Too sharp. Too much challenge. \u201cHow wouldn\u2019t I know her?\u201d</p><p>But Lucas stared at him and didn\u2019t seem to buy that grin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who knew where Marie was last night,\u201d Dane spoke slowly, as if thinking his way through something.</p><p>Piers slanted him a measuring glance. \u201cBecause Lucas wants us to keep tabs on her. I do what the alpha wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not looking into the Dark, are you, Piers?\u201d The question was Lucas\u2019s.</p><p>The Dark\u2014dark magic.</p><p>But Piers just lifted one shoulder. \u201cThe Dark\u2019s been looking at me for years. We all know it.\u201d His grin faded. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much time until it takes over.\u201d</p><p>Because he thought he\u2019d be one of the wolf shifters who crossed the line and became psychotic. She\u2019d touched his mind, she knew the potential was there. But, then again, it was always there.</p><p>With man and beast.</p><p>\u201cYou been looking for a magic cure?\u201d Lucas pressed.</p><p>There was no cure. Not unless . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been looking at a pretty lady. Where\u2019s the crime in that?\u201d</p><p>But Sarah was sure he was lying then, and she knew the others realized it, too.</p><p>Piers\u2019s spine straightened. \u201cDo you want me to take you to Josie or do you want to let the vamp get to her first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosette isn\u2019t my prey. Her fight isn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>The ring seemed heavier in Sarah\u2019s hands. \u201cI promised a trade to Marie.\u201d</p><p>Was this the debt she\u2019d pay? Marie had saved Lucas, now...</p><p>\u201cSomeone gave Caleb the Angel Dust.\u201d Piers huffed out a hard breath. \u201cAnd Josie . . . hell, if anyone knows how to make it in this town, it would be her.\u201d</p><p>Sarah saw Lucas\u2019s claws burst from his skin. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you say so sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause I didn\u2019t want her marked for death.\u201d Lines bracketed his mouth. \u201cCause I\u2019m a selfish bastard, and, hell, yeah, I was hoping to use her.\u201d Pain hollowed his eyes. \u201cEvery time I shift, I want the blood, I want it so bad . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucas grabbed his shirt front and hauled Piers closer. \u201cThen, from here on out, you don\u2019t shift without me by your side, got it? Because I\u2019m not losing another packmate.\u201d</p><p>Piers\u2019s gaze fell.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Lucas barked. \u201cShit, if Maya and her man get to her first, they\u2019ll take her away and we won\u2019t find out a damn thing about the Dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t get there first.\u201d Piers swallowed. \u201cMaya doesn\u2019t know how far the angel fell, not yet.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s stare bored into him. \u201cBut you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I know what it\u2019s like to fall, and I know where the Fallen go.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Sarah bet he did.</p><p>At a little past noon, the bar on Brinks Street should have been empty. And if it had been a regular joint, the place probably would have been closed up tight.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t your typical hole-in-the-wall bar. Not by a long shot.</p><p>Lucas eyed the entrance, noting the two men who slouched just outside the doors. He\u2019d bet those guys were a lot more aware than they pretended to be.</p><p>\u201cYou sure she\u2019s here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>From what he remembered about Josette, the lady was pure class. She owned an art gallery, a real fancy place that he\u2019d never even gotten within a mile of\u2014except for the few times he\u2019d been tracking her.</p><p>Josette had cut off contact with Marie a while back. It had looked like the woman had gone no-magic and hadn\u2019t looked back.</p><p>So he\u2019d stopped watching her.</p><p>And hadn\u2019t seen her fall.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s there.\u201d Piers was certain. \u201cShe comes here for the blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, the blood?\u201d Sarah repeated, and there wasn\u2019t really any fear in her voice. No, it sounded more like morbid curiosity.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you can do with the blood of Others,\u201d Piers said. \u201cIf you have the right magic.\u201d</p><p>Lucas grunted. Piers was the only shifter he\u2019d brought with him. He hadn\u2019t wanted to attract too much attention.</p><p>But with Rafe out there, he also hadn\u2019t wanted to risk being separated from Sarah\u2014so he\u2019d made certain she stayed at his side.</p><p>I\u2019ll keep her safe. From now on, where he went, so did she. He\u2019d claimed her, right in front of the pack. Been ready to fight for her. Hell, had the woman really thought he\u2019d let any of his wolves hurt her? No matter how pissed . . . hell, no, he\u2019d never let anyone so much as scratch her.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted his intent to be clear. So he\u2019d challenged the others, and claimed her.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>And she hadn\u2019t refused the claim. Hadn\u2019t told him to shut the hell up. She\u2019d . . . accepted him.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan here?\u201d Sarah wanted to know. \u201cWe go in, you guys with claws up and blazing . . .\u201d</p><p>Blazing? Lucas shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s try charm first.\u201d She smiled at him then. A real smile. One that lit her face and had his cock rising. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Later.</p><p>He might want to shield her and cover her twenty-four /seven, but the woman was ex-FBI.</p><p>That meant cosseting her wasn\u2019t gonna fly. Besides, he\u2019d already noticed that Sarah seemed to like the action.</p> <p>Good, so did he.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take it easy,\u201d he said, rolling his shoulders to push the tension away. \u201c\u2019Til we find our prey.\u201d Then the claws could come out.</p><p>Angel\u2019s Dust. If Josette really had made the drug and given it to Caleb . . .</p><p>Even being Marie\u2019s granddaughter wouldn\u2019t save her ass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing the guys at the front will let you in,\u201d he said to Piers and wondered just how close to the edge his friend truly was. Close enough to trade in the Dark.</p> <p>Hell. That was too close. Because no trade was ever as simple as it looked on the surface. Magic always took so much more.</p><p>And you didn\u2019t realize it, not until the trade was made, and your soul was gone.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll let me in.\u201d Grim words.</p><p>So they went straight for the door. The guards glanced at Piers and eased back. Their stares tensed a bit on Sarah, but they didn\u2019t try to stop her or Lucas from entering the bar.</p><p>Silence greeted them inside, but then, it would. In a place like this, the first thing you saw would always be a lie. Usually a scene set to fool humans.</p><p>Piers went straight for the staircase on the left side. A staircase that led down, not up. A gnarled old man sat there. The guy motioned with a roll of his hand for Piers to go forward, but when Lucas approached, the guy\u2019s hand rose and pushed against his chest.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t have what you need,\u201d the old man said.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s arm brushed Lucas\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot for either of you.\u201d</p><p>Piers glanced back at the guy. \u201cThey\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>The man studied them with sharp, pitch-black eyes. Demon eyes. Lucas\u2019s nostrils flared. That scent . . .</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the demon said definitely. \u201cThey\u2019re not with you. Don\u2019t make that mistake, wolf.\u201d</p><p>Lucas brought his claws up and let the tips hover just over the bastard\u2019s carotid. \u201cI don\u2019t really care what shit you try to sell to the other fools who come in, but don\u2019t jerk around my pack.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what the asshole was doing. Trying to make Piers doubt their alliance.</p><p>The old demon grinned, showing off a gold front tooth.</p> <p>\u201cNow get your hand off me, or my claws will go deeper.\u201d</p><p>The hand dropped.</p><p>Lucas grabbed Sarah\u2019s wrist and followed Piers.</p><p>\u201cI know your weakness, alpha!\u201d The bastard called after him. \u201cDamn foolish to show us all.\u201d</p><p>Lucas froze. Then he turned his head, very slowly, and met that black stare. \u201cDemon, if you think you can take me, come on and try.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s fingers curled around his arm. \u201cLucas . . . remember why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>The demon\u2019s gaze dropped to that touch. Studied it. \u201cDoes your charmer know how many you\u2019ve killed, Alpha?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t look at Sarah. \u201cYou seem to know,\u201d he said instead. \u201cAnd yet you\u2019re still stupid enough to keep talking right now?\u201d</p><p>And that shut up the little bastard. The demon turned and scurried away.</p><p>Lucas growled and when he glanced back at Piers, he found the other guy watching him, too closely. \u201cDon\u2019t believe any shit they tell you here,\u201d he ordered Piers, but really, the guy should have enough sense to know that. \u201cThey try to break you so they can use you.\u201d</p><p>A fucking Magic Hole. That\u2019s what this place was. He could feel the edge of the dark magic pulling at him. Some places were thought of as hotspots for the supernaturals. Places where power could peak. Yeah, this wasn\u2019t a place like that. It was a place that would suck you dry and here, only those who bled the others\u2014only those would get stronger.</p><p>Get out.</p><p>As soon as he could, they\u2019d be leaving and not coming back. Because a place like this, where the power was so close, so close and all you had to do was\u2014</p><p>Reach out and kill for it.</p><p>\u2014it was tempting him.</p><p>So he knew the magic was calling to Piers.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s hold tightened. \u201cLet\u2019s find this Josette and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>They climbed down the stairs. Eyes watched them. Whispers followed. Almost every kind of paranormal out there liked to set up a safe house of sorts. Vamps created feeding rooms, bars that lured in unsuspecting human prey. Demons who were addicted to drugs flocked to their damn dens.</p><p>And then places like this . . . holes for the darkest of the Other . . . lurked in the big cities.</p><p>Lucas kept his claws out. He figured he\u2019d be fighting his way out soon enough.</p><p>But no one approached them, not yet. A makeshift bar was set up near the foot of the stairs. Piers headed to it and slapped his hands on the surface. \u201cJosette.\u201d</p><p>The bartender stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s here.\u201d Piers glared back. \u201cDo you really want me to claw the truth out of you again?\u201d</p><p>And Lucas saw the healing scratches on the bartender\u2019s muscled arms.</p><p>The guy grunted and pointed to the left. Another door.</p><p>A trap?</p><p>Probably.</p><p>But they went toward that door anyway. And with every step they took, the scent of death deepened around them.</p><p>He risked a quick glance at Sarah. She hadn\u2019t caught the scent. Wouldn\u2019t for a while yet. But . . .</p><p>Death waited behind that door.</p><p>Piers reached for the knob. Lucas got ready for the battle that was coming. So much death, the scent clogged his nose and he wondered what he\u2019d find, how many bodies, how much blood, how\u2014</p><p>The door swung open. Candles sputtered in the room, the only light that glowed, and illuminated the kneeling woman. A white circle had been drawn on the floor, it surrounded her. Her long black hair hid her face.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t need to see her face in order to recognize Josette. And, damn, what had happened to her? Because that scent of death was coming from her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look up. Not when they came inside and not when the door shut behind them. She knelt there, frozen like a statue, and waited.</p><p>It was Sarah who moved first. She pulled free of Lucas and walked across the room. She bent, coming close to Josette, but Lucas noticed she was very careful not to touch that white circle. Smart.</p><p>Sarah put the ring on the wooden floor. Sat it down and . . . Josette\u2019s head snapped up. She was just as beautiful, her face just as perfect as it had always been, her skin still a sweet dark cream but her eyes . . . they were different. The darkness of her eyes just looked . . . empty.</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s gone.\u201d Josette\u2019s voice was perfectly modulated. No whisper of Louisiana, though Lucas knew that had been her home for many years. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to bring me proof.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reach for the ring. Just stared at it.</p><p>Then her gaze lifted to Lucas. \u201cYou came to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to find out what the hell you\u2019re doing.\u201d That scent was clogging his nostrils. Since when did a human smell like death?</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the ring. \u201cVampires killed my mother. I thought\u2014for years I thought they were the ones I should hate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost vamps are bastards that need hating,\u201d Piers said, edging around behind Josette.</p><p>\u201cMost,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t the only monsters out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re surrounded by monsters right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze rose once more and tears glistened in her eyes. \u201cI let the monster in. I\u2019m the one.\u201d</p><p>Sarah still knelt near the other woman. \u201cYou know Rafe, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafael.\u201d Whispered with emotion. Love. Pain. Hate. \u201cI knew him when we were children. My grand-m\u00e8re took him in. I thought he was safe. I-I didn\u2019t know . . .\u201d She swallowed. \u201cThis time, I took him in. I let him in.\u201d Her hands turned over and she stared at her smooth palms. \u201cAll the blood is on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing on you,\u201d Sarah told her. \u201cHave you been taking something? You could be hallucinating. Nothing\u2019s there, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>A choked laugh interrupted her words. \u201cThe blood is always there now. Never thought I had much power, thought I was safe. Normal. I tried to be for so long . . .\u201d Her shoulders fell. \u201cBut I guess I was good at one thing.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced around the room, searching for more threats, but he saw nothing. Just the small woman.</p><p>\u201cHe killed Maxime and Helene. He killed them when I wouldn\u2019t give him the Dust. I told him I didn\u2019t work the magic. That grand-m\u00e8re had all the power, but he said she wouldn\u2019t see him.\u201d Soft, slow. \u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t help him, I said I wanted to be normal.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s hand lifted, as if she were going to reach over the circle and touch Josette. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he growled because he knew just how powerful those magical circles could be.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s hand froze in mid-air.</p><p>\u201cHe killed Maxime and Helene because they blocked him from getting to grand-m\u00e8re, and then he went after my Martin.\u201d She breathed the other man\u2019s name on a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI would have done anything for Martin.\u201d Her eyes rose to Sarah\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ll know what that\u2019s like soon.\u201d</p><p>The hair rose on Lucas\u2019s nape.</p><p>\u201cI got the Dust. Grand-m\u00e8re gave it to me. She didn\u2019t like it, but\u2014she gave it to me. She would\u2019ve given me anything. I always knew that.\u201d Such aching sadness. \u201cThen I gave it to the bastard . . . but he still took my Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sarah whispered.</p><p>Josette kept talking. The words tumbled from her lips. \u201cMartin was going to marry me. He was going to make sure I never had to face the Darkness again. He was going to be mine!\u201d</p><p>That was when Lucas noticed the other ring. A diamond ring, resting in that cast circle.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to let him go.\u201d She reached for the diamond ring and traced it with a loving fingertip. \u201cGrand-m\u00e8re said I should, but I just wasn\u2019t ready. You see, I\u2019d waited for him my whole life.\u201d Her eyes squeezed closed and a tear tracked down her cheek as she whispered, \u201cDeath wasn\u2019t going to take him away from me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Hell. \u201cWe can\u2019t always stop death,\u201d Lucas told her, but the words were a reminder the woman shouldn\u2019t need. She\u2019d lost both her parents long ago. She knew what a fickle bitch death could be.</p><p>At that, Josette\u2019s lashes lifted and her dark eyes met his. \u201cIt turns out I can.\u201d The ghost of a smile curved her full lips. \u201cSeems I do have a bit of power after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Sarah asked her, and Piers just stood, watching. \u201cYou didn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t letting him go!\u201d Josette jumped to her feet, but stayed inside that circle. Sarah rose, too. \u201cHe was mine. I tried to get him back. How is that wrong? I tried . . . and he came.\u201d</p><p>Because little Josette had raised the dead. Oh, she hadn\u2019t made a zombie the way Hollywood portrayed them to be. No mindless monster that had to eat brains. No, the Raised didn\u2019t feed on humans. Didn\u2019t feed on anyone; well, not unless the person who\u2019d raised them gave that order.</p><p>\u201cYou crossed the line, Josette.\u201d He kept his voice firm because to raise the dead, hell, that took some very dark magic.</p><p>Bokor. That was the name for the one who used the Dark powers. But there was a price for that magic, there always was.</p><p>\u201cI brought him back. He didn\u2019t have to die! I brought him back and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you brought the Haitian back, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Piers narrowed his eyes on her. \u201cHim and the woman.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they did die,\u201d Lucas pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re not the one who gets to yank them back, you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking vampires cheat death! They come back, they live forever! They feed on humans and they kill and destroy.\u201d Josette\u2019s chest heaved. \u201cMartin, Maxime, and Helene\u2014they were good people. They should have gotten to keep living.\u201d She shoved back her hair. \u201cSo I gave them a chance.\u201d</p><p>No, because he knew how this worked. Josette wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d ever been tempted. \u201cThey don\u2019t come back the same. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Her bottom lip still trembled but she caught it, biting it with her top teeth.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have a will of their own.\u201d Piers spoke now. Yeah, figured he\u2019d know all about the Raised, too. Because that was what they were called in the right circles. Raised. \u201cThey\u2019re puppets. They have to do whatever you command.\u201d</p><p>Her hair flew back as she shook her head, hard. \u201cI commanded them to live, that was all. They had choices. They had free will!\u201d</p><p>Had. Interesting word choice. Lucas let his gaze rake her. \u201cYou know Maxime and Helene are back in the grave, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids flickered. \u201cGrand-m\u00e8re released them.\u201d Flat.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Martin? Did she release Martin, too?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the diamond ring. \u201cI did that.\u201d She swallowed and the painful click was too loud. \u201cHe . . . asked . . . he didn\u2019t want to stay with me. He knew what . . . he was and he didn\u2019t want to stay with me. He said\u2014he said I\u2019d made him into a monster.\u201d A tear tracked down her cheek. \u201cI just wanted to save him!\u201d Her eyes looked as dark as a demon\u2019s. \u201cBut he said I was the one who\u2019d turned him into a nightmare. Me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sarah\u2019s gaze cut toward Lucas. Her expression was so stark\u2014but then she glanced back at Josette. \u201cHe didn\u2019t realize what you\u2019d done for him.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders fell. \u201cI traded everything for him. There\u2019s no going back now. Once the Dark gets you . . .\u201d Her hand lifted and her fingers curled into a fist. \u201cThere\u2019s no fighting.\u201d</p><p>The hair on his nape was still up. Lucas looked at the symbols she\u2019d written so carefully around her circle. Some signs he recognized. Some had him worried as hell. And some . . . some he didn\u2019t understand at all. \u201cWhat\u2019s the circle for, Josette?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can hear the dead,\u201d she said, speaking quietly. \u201cThey call to me now. Some are stronger than others, and some want to rise.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. \u201cWho are you bringing back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrand-m\u00e8re.\u201d Whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice snapped out, fueled with an angry heat. \u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t want to come back. I don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re hearing, but Marie wouldn\u2019t want to be pulled from the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in the grave yet . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t want this!\u201d Sarah\u2019s cheeks flushed. Josette\u2019s head whipped toward her. \u201cHow would you know? You know nothing about her, you don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie could see the future, couldn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could see everything.\u201d</p><p>Lucas knew that was true.</p><p>\u201cThen she knew Death was coming,\u201d Sarah said, and Lucas saw her shoes edge closer to that line. No. \u201cShe didn\u2019t fight her attacker. She let him in, let him get close enough to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d Josette lunged forward. Her hand flew out of the circle and caught Sarah\u2019s arm.</p> <p>A hiss of sound filled the room, just like a snake\u2019s hiss. The candles flickered.</p><p>\u201cMarie knew.\u201d Sarah kept talking. Her body was still out of the circle, and Josette was trapped inside. \u201cShe said\u2014she told me, \u2018There\u2019s no saving everyone. No matter how you fight, Death will still be there.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Josette swayed.</p><p>\u201cShe wants you to let her go. She told me, I didn\u2019t understand then, but she said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be alone, I won\u2019t!\u201d Josette screamed.</p><p>Then Sarah lunged forward, slamming her body into Josette\u2019s, and the two women pitched back, falling right out of that circle.</p><p>The hiss died away. The candles stopped flickering.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d Sarah crouched over Josette. \u201cLet her go.\u201d</p> <p>Josette started to cry, not just silent trickles of tears. Deep, gulping sobs.</p><p>The door shattered, sending wood flying into the room. Lucas spun around, claws up, and saw Maya and her shifter shoving through the wood.</p><p>Ah, figured they\u2019d be here now. Always a little late to the party.</p><p>But Maya froze after taking just a step. \u201cWhy the hell does this place smell . . .\u201d Her nostrils flared a bit and he knew she\u2019d caught the stench of death. \u201cJosie, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust raised a little dead,\u201d Lucas muttered, rubbing the back of his neck and wondering what would have happened if Sarah hadn\u2019t gotten Josette out of that circle. \u201cJust a little dead.\u201d</p><p>Josette cried harder and he heard her choke out, \u201cMartin.\u201d \u201cOh, damn.\u201d Understanding filled Maya\u2019s voice. She crept forward, but Josette immediately flinched. Josette\u2019s hands curled tight around Sarah.</p><p>\u201cJosette.\u201d Lucas said her name, deliberately making it snap like a whip.</p><p>Her head jerked up.</p><p>He knew grief was ripping her apart, but time was his enemy right then. He didn\u2019t want any more dead on the streets. \u201cYou know Rafe killed Marie, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A slow nod.</p><p>He growled, satisfied. \u201cSo that means you stay the hell off my back, vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still mine.\u201d Figured Maya wouldn\u2019t back off that easily.</p><p>Josette\u2019s gaze darted between them.</p><p>Maya tried taking another step forward. \u201cJosette, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can help me.\u201d But she kept holding onto Sarah.</p><p>Lucas unclenched his teeth. \u201cYou have a cure for the Dust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no cure.\u201d No more tears. Flat, emotionless. Like the woman had totally shut down now, her fight gone.</p><p>Fucking fantastic. \u201cWhere\u2019s Rafe?\u201d</p><p>She just stared up at him.</p><p>His teeth were clenching again. \u201cWhere. Is. He?\u201d He stalked toward her. \u201cYou want vengeance for what he\u2019s done? I\u2019ll give you vengeance. I\u2019ll rip his head off and I\u2019ll bring it to you and you can make sure no one ever lets that bastard rise.\u201d His breath heaved out. \u201cJust tell me where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Maya took a few more steps. \u201cThat\u2019s a circle for protection, Josie. Did you think he was coming after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he is.\u201d A sad smile. \u201cRafe always likes to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTie up loose ends,\u201d Sarah finished.</p><p>Josette looked at Sarah then, a deep, probing look. \u201cHe told me about you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, this wasn\u2019t going to be good. Lucas reached for Sarah\u2019s hand and closed his fingers around hers. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here.\u201d There was nothing more to learn. If Josette wasn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe thought you were his mate,\u201d she told Sarah.</p><p>\u201cHe thought wrong,\u201d was her immediate answer.</p><p>\u201cRafael thought you\u2019d be the one to give him the thing he desired most.\u201d Her dark gaze slid to Lucas. \u201cFor wolves, it\u2019s always about the base needs, isn\u2019t it? Lust, hunger, vengeance.\u201d</p><p>Lucas held her stare. \u201cI didn\u2019t start the war. He came gunning for me.\u201d Not like he\u2019d just stand there and become the asshole\u2019s bitch. \u201cNo one makes that mistake and lives.\u201d</p><p>Her stare slipped to his savaged ear. \u201cWound for wound,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe way of the beast.\u201d</p><p>No, the way of the beast was tooth and claw until death. Fight and kill. Or damn well be killed.</p><p>\u201cHe knows your weakness, Lucas Simone.\u201d She rose with Sarah, her body shaking just a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s how he works. He knew my weakness, and he used it against me. Knew mine, knew grand-m\u00e8re\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The mambo had a weakness?</p><p>Her breath whispered out. \u201cRafael always knows how to hurt his prey the most.\u201d</p><p>Good damn deal for him. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of pain.\u201d</p><p>For just an instant, her dark gaze seemed to fog, the way he\u2019d seen Marie\u2019s do once. \u201cVery soon, you will be.\u201d</p><p>Not likely. \u201cI can handle any pain the bastard throws at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said it would be your pain.\u201d Her gaze drifted over Maya.</p><p>\u201cNow you sound like Marie,\u201d Maya said.</p><p>Josette\u2019s face tightened.</p><p>\u201cPiers, take Josette back to the compound.\u201d His gaze met the other shifter\u2019s. Don\u2019t let her out of your sight. There was much more to learn from Josette, he knew it. He just didn\u2019t want to question her more with the vamp and her bodyguard /mate there.</p><p>Sure, they had an alliance, of sorts, and he was in the unfortunate situation of actually owing Brody, but he made it a policy not to trust vamps too far. Or at all, really.</p><p>At his words, Maya shook her head. \u201cJosette\u2019s coming with me.\u201d She offered her hand, palm up, to the other woman. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Josette didn\u2019t take the offered hand. \u201cThe Dust . . .\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cWhy did you ask about it, Lucas? It wouldn\u2019t hurt wolves, just demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe used it to infect a demon I know.\u201d That\u2019s all he\u2019d say. Josette and the others didn\u2019t need to know about the hybrid in his pack.</p><p>Secrets stayed in the pack.</p><p>\u201cIs he . . . is he dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only gave Rafael one batch.\u201d</p><p>Maya and Brody were watching with narrowed eyes. Both of them hearing everything that was said, and what wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Her palm brushed at the tear tracks on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even sure it would work.\u201d</p><p>Oh, it had worked.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t make it. But grand-m\u00e8re . . . could do anything.\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d still died. No matter how powerful, everyone could still die.</p><p>\u201cAll kinds came to see grand-m\u00e8re.\u201d Her lips curved down. \u201cWhen you traded . . . even angels had to fall.\u201d</p><p>Almost helplessly then, his stare slid back to Sarah. Just because Marie was dead, it didn\u2019t mean she still wouldn\u2019t claim her payment. No, a payment was always due.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Josie,\u201d Maya said again. \u201cYou know I can keep you safe. If you don\u2019t want to stay with me, I\u2019ve got some cops who will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust the cops in this town if I were you,\u201d Lucas advised.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sarah echoed him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>Indecision flashed across Josette\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cJosette.\u201d Intensity fired Maya\u2019s voice. \u201cYou trusted me once. Trust me again. I will keep you safe.\u201d Her gaze zeroed in on Lucas. \u201cHe just wants to use you.\u201d</p><p>True enough. He didn\u2019t exactly trust Josette. That circle hadn\u2019t been all about protection\u2014Maya was wrong. Josette had been set to raise the dead again. Marie, or . . .</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t trust her. And he wanted her where he could keep a guard on her.</p><p>But Josette reached for Maya\u2019s hand.</p><p>Lucas growled. \u201cWrong choice.\u201d</p><p>Maya pulled the woman closer.</p><p>And he had to give a warning. Because . . . once, he\u2019d seen past the vampire and glimpsed the woman inside. \u201cDon\u2019t trust her.\u201d</p><p>Maya\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou bastard! I\u2019d never hurt her, I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to you, Maya.\u201d He caught Sarah\u2019s hand and pulled her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the good little Josie anymore,\u201d Piers said.</p><p>The candles flickered.</p><p>Lucas wondered . . . had she ever been that Josie? Or had she been tricking them all along?</p><p>Death teased his nostrils.</p><p>A strong hand grabbed his shoulder. Ah, now Brody was trying to get a piece of him. Wrong move. Lucas didn\u2019t care how old or strong that shifter was; even legends could die.</p><p>\u201cIf I find him first,\u201d Adam Brody\u2019s mouth hitched into a hard grin\u2014one that promised pain. \u201cThey\u2019ll be nothing left for you to see but ash.\u201d</p><p>Promises, promises.</p><p>\u201cI gave you a kill once,\u201d Brody said. \u201cThis one\u2019s personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right it is.\u201d He knew Maya had been close with the mambo, but her revenge would have to wait. \u201cHe\u2019s after me. After my pack.\u201d Lucas let the wolf off his leash, and he knew his eyes would glow with the power of the beast. \u201cHe\u2019ll be dead by my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I find him first, wolf.\u201d</p><p>Asshole. Brody wasn\u2019t backing down. But Brody also didn\u2019t know this town, not like Lucas did. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d He pushed through the broken door, aware of the silence behind him, ahead of him. Everyone in the bar was straining to hear. Not that hearing would be so hard for most of the bastards. Not with their Other senses.</p><p>He stalked to the center of the bar. Sarah was at his side. Piers at his back. All the eyes were on him, the silence even thicker now.</p><p>He waited, letting his gaze sweep the place. Maya guided Josette up the stairs, glancing back at him only once. He caught the black flash of her eyes.</p><p>Brody stayed below, taking up a position right at the foot of the stairs. The blond crossed his arms over his chest and waited, watching Lucas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a wolf shifter.\u201d Lucas let his voice ring out. Loud and clear.</p><p>No one moved.</p><p>\u201cRafael Santiago. The bastard came to town, started killing in my area, and I want him found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead . . .\u201d A woman\u2019s voice called out. \u201cOr alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive.\u201d Because the kill would be his.</p><p>He saw a few gazes slide away from him. Two men sidled toward another door on the right-hand side of the room.</p><p>The woman who\u2019d questioned him pushed through the crowd. Her hair was red as fire and her mouth was stained with blood. \u201cHow much?\u201d Vampire.</p><p>He heard Sarah\u2019s quick, indrawn breath. He brushed his fingers lightly over the inside of her wrist.</p><p>\u201cYeah, wolf . . . how much?\u201d Now a big, burly bastard was next to the woman. A bear shifter. McKennis. Their paths had crossed more than a few times. \u201cWhat will you pay if we bring him to you?\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled at him. \u201cI don\u2019t pay you a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>Mutters in the crowd then. Growls. A snarl.</p><p>He saw Brody raise a brow.</p><p>\u201cThen why the fuck should we tell you anything?\u201d McKennis demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause . . .\u201d Lucas strode toward him and in a flash, he had his claws right over the bear\u2019s heart. Dumb asshole. For all his size, he was always too slow to defend. \u201cIf I find out someone in this shithole knows where Rafe is or has been helping him hide . . .\u201d His claws sliced right through McKennis\u2019s shirt. The bear didn\u2019t even seem to breathe. \u201cGuess who\u2019ll be next on my hit list?\u201d</p><p>That shut \u2019em up.</p><p>He let his gaze scan the room once more. He memorized every face. Because he would be seeing them all. Sooner or later.</p><p>No one spoke as he turned and followed Sarah and Piers back to the stairs. He stayed in the rear, deliberately, hoping someone would try to attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But they all stood frozen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have a lot of charm, do you?\u201d Brody murmured when Lucas reached the stairs.</p><p>Lucas froze.

It won\u2019t touch me.\u201d His gaze was on Brody.</p><p>\u201cIt?\u201d Sarah repeated. \u201cWhat\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need to go,\u201d Piers growled and pulled her up the stairs. \u201cTrust me. Shit, I\u2019ve seen his work before.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile curved Brody\u2019s lips. \u201cYou really should just let me handle this. I can take Rafe out, nice and neat.\u201d</p><p>Neat? Since when was fire and singed flesh neat?</p><p>\u201cYou do it your way.\u201d His claws dug into the wooden banister. \u201cI\u2019ll do it mine.\u201d</p><p>Brody nodded. \u201cFine. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>Then the guy was moving. Stalking back toward the death room that Josette had used. Figured. Maya would want that place destroyed.</p> <p>And Brody had a thing about making Maya happy.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s feet pounded up the stairs. He\u2019d just reached the top when the scent of smoke teased his nostrils. Yeah, just what he\u2019d thought.</p><p>Lucas shoved open the door. He spared a glance for the old demon. \u201cBetter get a head start on running. The stampede will be coming up soon.\u201d Once they realized there was no stopping Brody\u2019s fire.</p><p>Because Adam Brody wasn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill shifter. In fact, Lucas had never met anyone quite like him.</p><p>Got to find Rafe first. Pack business. The kill wasn\u2019t for an outsider.</p><p>The demon turned and scrambled, rushing for a side door.</p><p>Screams drifted up from below. Voices rose and fell.</p><p>Lucas kept walking. He could have barred the door behind him. Made the monsters who liked the dark suffer more, but then, that wasn\u2019t the point, was it?</p> <p>No, his job now was to wait and watch. To see just who crawled free and scrambled for safety.</p><p>And who went running to Rafe.</p><p>The heat from the sun hit him when he stalked outside, but it was nothing compared to the fire igniting in the bar. The dragon knew how to burn. Others ran out behind him. The female vamp. Figured she\u2019d escape first. Vamps didn\u2019t get along so well with fire.</p><p>Sarah waited for him with her hands on her slender hips. \u201cWhat the hell was that? Did you want to piss off every paranormal in the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d A group of demons flew past him. McKennis rushed into the parking lot. Looked like the back of the bear\u2019s shirt was smoking.</p><p>Sarah marched toward him. \u201cYou succeeded then. They\u2019ll be gunning for you, they\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d</p><p>He covered her body with his, pulling her close and kissing her just as he heard the explosion behind him. Glass shards rained onto his back, some breaking through the skin. He didn\u2019t let her go. His lips opened over hers and his tongue thrust inside her mouth.</p><p>She breathed his name and the lust surged through him. Dangerous. No, those jerks running away weren\u2019t the ones he needed to worry about. They wouldn\u2019t hurt him.</p><p>But Sarah . . . yeah, she just might be able to.</p><p>He eased back and gazed down at her. \u201cLucas . . .\u201d She looked over his shoulder and her eyes widened. The growing fire was reflected in her gaze. \u201cWhat happened in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Maya and Brody wanted to make sure Josette didn\u2019t try casting her circles there again.\u201d He threw a fast glance back at the bar. Now the place was really burning. Those orange and red flames stretched straight to the sky.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s breasts brushed against him. \u201cBut how\u2019d the fire start?\u201d</p><p>He pressed another kiss to her lips. \u201cBabe, you don\u2019t want to know.\u201d From the corner of his eye, he saw McKennis and the female vamp. The vamp jumped into a pickup while McKennis fled the scene on foot.</p><p>And he also saw the old demon. Not running, just staring at the fire, watching the place burn, and there was fury on his face.</p><p>\u201cWho do we follow?\u201d Piers asked, coming up beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou go after Maya. Make sure that Josette keeps her nose clean.\u201d Like that was going to happen. Playing with dark magic was like taking crack. Or so a witch had told him once. Just a few hits were all you needed to get hooked, and that was one addiction you couldn\u2019t beat.</p><p>He stepped away from Sarah. \u201cWe\u2019re following the demon.\u201d Because the guy had whirled away from the building and was now rushing down the alley. Moving fast for someone so old. But then, Lucas didn\u2019t really think the guy was old. A demon didn\u2019t just use glamour to disguise the true color of his eyes. If the demon had enough power, glamour could be used to hide anything . . . or to transform the demon into just about anyone.</p><p>A lesson Marley had taught him.</p><p>\u201cStay close,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTry to keep me away,\u201d she told him and then they were running, heading right for that alley, sticking close to the old building\u2019s walls. The stench of garbage hit him and old alcohol burned his nose.</p><p>The demon was moving fast. Didn\u2019t really matter how fast he ran, though, Lucas had the scent now.</p><p>Sarah kept pace easily, rushing just as quickly as he did through the narrow alley. In the distance, a fire truck\u2019s alarm screamed. Lucas knew that by the time the truck got to the scene, the building would be too far gone to save.</p><p>Brody didn\u2019t screw around.</p><p>Neither did he.</p><p>The demon burst from the alley. Lucas froze, and threw up a hand, blocking Sarah. That demon wasn\u2019t just running blind. He was heading for a black van, one with a familiar cable company\u2019s logo on the side.</p><p>His gut twisted. The van didn\u2019t fit with Rafe\u2019s setup. No way, but . . .</p><p>The door flew open as the demon approached and the guy jumped inside. The van\u2019s motor snarled to life. Lucas\u2019s eyes slit.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait, Lucas, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Too late. He raced forward just as the tail-lights flashed on. They weren\u2019t getting away from him that easily.</p><p>Once again, the back doors of that van flew open. Only Rafe wasn\u2019t the one glaring down at him.</p><p>A woman stood there. A woman with long red hair and golden eyes. The demon was right behind her, gripping her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTold you he was comin\u2019!\u201d the demon cried. \u201cWe need to go, we need\u2014\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Karen! Don\u2019t!\u201d Sarah\u2019s scream of fury.</p><p>But the woman lifted her hand and tazed him. Fucking tazed him.</p><p>The electrodes shot right into his chest. His body jerked, shuddered, and the shock rode hard through his system. The tremors didn\u2019t stop after a few moments, they just continued, shaking his whole body\u2014she must have amped up the tazer.</p><p>Growling, his hands flew up and he yanked out the electrodes even as the electricity still pumped through him.</p><p>The redhead\u2019s lips parted.</p><p>\u201cThat all you got?\u201d he asked, his claws ripping out. \u201cNot good enough.\u201d Then he attacked.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Lucas leapt up and landed in the van, tackling both Karen and the demon. Sarah jumped up behind him, ramming her knee on the bumper. She ignored the stab of pain and focused on the danger.</p><p>\u201cA tazer?\u201d Lucas laughed at that. \u201cDid you really think that shit was going to work on me?\u201d</p><p>Sarah scrambled closer, her breath panting out from the run and the adrenaline that spiked her blood. \u201cLucas, she\u2019s FBI, she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTazers work well enough on coyotes,\u201d Karen Phillips said, her voice calm, as if a wolf shifter didn\u2019t have his claws very near her throat. \u201cI figured it was worth a shot.\u201d Her gaze darted to Sarah. \u201cBesides, if I\u2019d shot you, I knew she\u2019d be seriously pissed.\u201d</p><p>The demon made a sound somewhere between a whimper and a moan.</p><p>Then there was a click. A very soft, very dangerous click of sound. Sarah glanced up and found herself staring down the barrel of a gun. One that a guy\u2014a young guy with dirty blond hair but one very steady hand\u2014had aimed on her.</p><p>The driver. No wonder the van wasn\u2019t flying down the road. The driver had stopped to get in on the action in the back.</p><p>\u201cTell the wolf to back off,\u201d the blond ordered.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t look away from Karen. \u201cTell the dumb asshole to drop his gun or I\u2019ll start slashing his partner.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yeah. Sounded like a Mexican standoff to Sarah. \u201cYou heard the man.\u201d Sarah extended her hand toward the driver. \u201cBut don\u2019t drop it, just give it to me.\u201d Because she\u2019d been itching to get her hands on a weapon. Tired of being defenseless.</p><p>The guy didn\u2019t move for ten seconds. Then Lucas\u2019s fingers drew closer to Karen\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re FBI!\u201d The blond yelled at Sarah, veins bulging in his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be on our side! You can\u2019t just stand there and let\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not FBI anymore.\u201d Lucas\u2019s glittering eyes lifted. \u201cShe\u2019s pack.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the agent\u2019s hold wasn\u2019t so steady.</p><p>The demon tried to sidle toward the still-open back doors. Not going to happen. Sarah moved slightly, putting her body between the demon and freedom.</p><p>\u201cCurtis, give her the gun!\u201d Karen yelled. \u201cI know shifters. He\u2019ll slice me before you can even fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucas said softly. \u201cI will.\u201d He smiled. \u201cThen I\u2019ll come after you, Curtis.\u201d</p><p>Curtis swore and turned his hand, offering the gun to Sarah. She reached for the weapon, wrapped her fingers around the butt of the gun\u2014</p><p>The demon tried to jump out of the van. Right. She\u2019d expected that. One fast elbow jab and she had him slamming into the side of the van. Still holding the gun, Sarah yanked the back doors closed, one at a time.</p><p>Then her gaze swept the small scene.</p><p>\u201cYou can . . . get off me now . . .\u201d Karen glared up at Lucas. He shook his head and leaned in closer. \u201cWanna tell me why the hell you smell like coyote . . .\u201d He inhaled and Sarah saw a muscle jerk in his jaw. \u201cAnd wolf?\u201d</p><p>Uh, oh. Sarah pointed the gun at Curtis. \u201cDrive. Get us out of here.\u201d They\u2019d wasted too much time. Left those back doors open too long. There were too many other eyes out there, watching.</p><p>\u201cDrive?\u201d The guy parroted. \u201cTo where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cAnd, yeah, I\u2019m sure you know exactly where that is, right?\u201d His right hand waved toward the row of surveillance equipment that lined the interior of the van. \u201cYou bastards have fun watching?\u201d</p><p>Curtis didn\u2019t answer, but he did crawl back toward the front of the van.</p><p>Lucas rose slowly and Sarah could see the leashed tension in his body. \u201cWho is she, Sarah?\u201d</p><p>Sarah licked her lips. \u201cKaren and I worked together, back when I was in the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that much.\u201d</p><p>The demon was on the floor, glaring at them both. Karen sat up, her shoulder brushing against his. The agent wasn\u2019t glaring. In fact, she didn\u2019t look the least bit pissed.</p><p>Odd.</p><p>Karen wasn\u2019t known for keeping her cool. Sarah\u2019s internal alarm went on high alert.</p><p>\u201cIs she a charmer, too?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m human,\u201d Karen told him, a little heat finally slipping into her voice. \u201cWe do exist too, you know.\u201d</p><p>The driver shoved down the gas pedal and the van lurched forward.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I need out of here!\u201d the demon yelled.</p><p>Lucas shot a piercing gaze at him. \u201cWant me to shut you up?\u201d</p><p>The demon\u2019s mouth closed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t smell human.\u201d Lucas turned his gaze back to the agent.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019ve been living with the coyotes for the last five months.\u201d She pushed her hair out of her face. \u201cHang around animals enough, and their scent sticks to you.\u201d</p><p>Half-true. So Sarah called her on the lie. \u201cAnd it helps if you visit a certain mambo in the area and get a special oil that gives off shifter scent, right, K?\u201d Because Karen wasn\u2019t the only agent who\u2019d used that trick. Only Sarah hadn\u2019t visited Marie. On another mission, she\u2019d used the warlock, Skye, to get the oil.</p><p>Karen\u2019s head inclined toward her.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you smell like wolf, too?\u201d Lucas wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Karen\u2019s breath eased out. \u201cThat would be because one of your precious pack kidnapped me. What you\u2019re scenting . . . that\u2019s your boy Dane.\u201d One red brow quirked. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing you already know that, right? You recognized his scent, and I\u2019m sure he would have briefed the big old alpha right away.</p><p>Lucas smiled. \u201cYes, he would have.\u201d He leaned in toward her. \u201cHe also would have told me that a human woman named Karen helped to get him captured, that she was working with the coyotes.\u201d</p><p>The van hit a pothole and Sarah grabbed the side of the vehicle to steady herself.</p><p>\u201cNot with them,\u201d Karen said, a faint line appearing between her brows. \u201cWorking undercover. You know what that is, right, wolf? When you have to do shit that makes you sick . . . all so you can keep the innocents in the world safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no innocents,\u201d Sarah whispered. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Karen\u2019s gaze cut to her. \u201cShe knows. Sarah\u2019s worked undercover more times than you can count. She blends. It\u2019s what we do. We get in, make \u2019em\u2014\u201d She shut up, fast, when she caught Sarah\u2019s narrowing eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Lucas would have been an idiot not to realize what Karen had been saying. \u201cYou make \u2019em trust you,\u201d he finished. \u201cThen you take the bastards down?\u201d His eyes were on Sarah.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s usually the plan,\u201d she managed, the gun feeling way too heavy in her hands.</p><p>\u201cThe bullets are silver,\u201d Karen told her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t check. Bad move there, S. You\u2019re losing your touch.\u201d</p> <p>The demon\u2019s eyes were bulging, but he wasn\u2019t saying a word. Sarah lifted the gun a bit. \u201cI felt the weight difference.\u201d Slight, but noticeable. The FBI was so predictable. \u201cI knew what I had.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s stare dropped to the gun, then slowly rose back up to her face. Oh, hell, no, he\u2019d better not be doubting her. Hadn\u2019t they already cleared this up?</p><p>\u201cThe gun will come in handy,\u201d Karen told her. \u201cBecause I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t have that knife of yours anymore.\u201d</p><p>Not anymore. Thanks to Rafe.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about to come in real handy,\u201d Sarah said, and adjusted her aim, just enough so that the barrel of the gun pointed at the demon. \u201cWhere is he.\u201d Not a question.</p> <p>Damn, but that demon was sweating. And, as she watched, his glamour faded away. His hair darkened, lengthened, his chin firmed up, his eyes flashed from weary gray to dark black.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever have the chance to meet Agent Greg Dulane?\u201d Karen pursed her lips. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty good at undercover work, too. Even better than you.\u201d</p><p>She could see where he would be.</p><p>Karen and Greg gazed up at her. \u201cHelp us,\u201d Karen said quietly. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been offered this deal before. Pretty much verbatim from her FBI supervisor.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s claws gouged into the side of the van. Damn.</p> <p>\u201cCut through this shit and tell me where the hell Rafe is,\u201d Lucas snarled. \u201cOr in a few minutes, you\u2019ll both be needing more help than anyone can give you.\u201d</p><p>The demon flinched.</p><p>\u201cRafe isn\u2019t working this alone. You know that.\u201d Karen\u2019s face had paled, but she was still fighting. Still Karen. \u201cI spent so long working on getting in with the coyotes, but then Rafe came in\u2014and he took out the whole damn group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a fucking shame.\u201d Lucas looked bored.</p><p>Karen swallowed. \u201cRafe didn\u2019t kill \u2019em. He sent more dogs in.\u201d Her hands pressed against her jeans. \u201cYou know he has Hayden on a tight leash. When Rafe says bite, Hayden rips the throat out of anyone near him.\u201d</p><p>Like John\u2019s throat had been ripped out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the coyotes for so long, but now John\u2019s dead.\u201d Karen\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cMy five months are shot down the drain and Hayden knows who I am. Who I really am. He\u2019s got me marked.\u201d</p><p>Sarah knew how that felt.</p> <p>\u201cThe coyotes have been killing with Rafe. They used to stay to the shadows but now\u2014they think it\u2019s a whole new game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Lucas growled. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what it\u2019s fucking become? The Bureau tries to shove the paranormals back, tries to scare us with the threat of extermination.\u201d He laughed at that. \u201cBut we\u2019re not the ones who\u2019ll be exterminated.\u201d</p><p>Karen blanched. \u201cThat\u2019s wh-what Rafe said, too. You all think that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Disgust had Lucas\u2019s mouth tightening. \u201cIn the dark, all paranormals are the fucking same, aren\u2019t we? We\u2019re all big, bad monsters who\u2019ll kill humans in a blink.\u201d</p><p>Some would. But not all. Didn\u2019t Karen realize yet? The supernaturals were just like humans. Some good, some very bad.</p><p>Karen\u2019s chin dropped. \u201cRafe and the coyotes have a list of undercover agents.\u201d</p><p>Now Karen had finally surprised Sarah. A fist squeezed her heart. \u201cHow the hell did they get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they had someone in the FBI who gave it to them. Someone who hacked the system, got the names, and just handed them right over.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cThose men who were murdered in Arizona weren\u2019t random. John wasn\u2019t random. Everyone they\u2019ve killed . . . they\u2019re taking out our watchers. Our agents.\u201d</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t possible. They couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cRafe thought he could turn you to his side. If he couldn\u2019t turn you, he\u2019d kill you.\u201d Flat. \u201cJohn wasn\u2019t given the option of turning. The coyotes didn\u2019t want a traitor with them.\u201d</p><p>An image of John\u2019s dead body flashed before her eyes.</p><p>\u201cEveryone they\u2019ve killed,\u201d Karen said again. \u201cThey\u2019re working on their own extermination list. Not just humans\u2014they\u2019re also taking out charmers and demons, but all their victims are undercover agents.\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d And she remembered Josette\u2019s grief. \u201cThere were three others. Here, in LA. They weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaxime and Helene?\u201d A bitter smile tugged at Karen\u2019s lips. \u201cThey were keeping tabs on the mambo. Letting us know who came to visit, and what price they had to pay. The mambo saw the most powerful and the weakest supernaturals in the area. Did you really think no one was watching her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d What had been his name? \u201cJosette\u2019s lover, he\u2014\u201d Sarah caught the fast glance the demon sent Karen. Oh, damn. \u201cDid she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he was a demon?\u201d Karen shrugged. \u201cProbably. Marie would have told her that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she know he was FBI?\u201d No, she hadn\u2019t known. Because Josette thought she was responsible for his death. She didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been marked, just as they all had been.</p><p>\u201cIf she knew then she wouldn\u2019t be working so hard right now to find and stop his killer, would she?\u201d And Karen\u2019s smile stretched, flashing way too many teeth.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s gut clenched. This wasn\u2019t right. \u201cDo you know what she\u2019s been doing? She raised him, K. The pain was so much that she raised him.\u201d</p><p>Karen\u2019s gaze dropped. \u201cI didn\u2019t . . . I never thought she\u2019d do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you never fucking thought.\u201d</p><p>Karen flinched at Lucas\u2019s disgust.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the granddaughter of a voodoo priestess, and you really believed she wouldn\u2019t turn to magic when her lover was killed?\u201d Lucas heaved out a hard breath. \u201cLady, you were kidding yourself. You knew she\u2019d break, and you and your boss didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>At that, Karen tried to jump up, but he shoved her right back down.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d she threw at him. \u201cDon\u2019t say what\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sarah shoved the gun into the back of her jeans. \u201cWho\u2019s the leak?\u201d</p><p>Her head nearly rapped into the top of the van. She had to crouch to stay upright.</p><p>Karen slanted her a fuming stare, but Sarah saw the tears glittering in the agent\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the leak?\u201d Lucas shouted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014we thought it was Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Hell. Figured. \u201cThen you never fucking thought,\u201d she repeated Lucas\u2019s words quietly, aware of the slight tremble in her fingers. She\u2019d bled for the Bureau. Taken so many cases, nearly lost herself. And they really thought she\u2019d sold the agents out? Sent them to their deaths?</p><p>\u201cHe was your lover, Sarah. You got in with him so fast. Some said too fast.\u201d Karen glanced at the demon, then back at Sarah. \u201cAnd you had access to the files on the undercover operatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and a dozen other agents.\u201d Dammit.</p><p>\u201cThen you quit the FBI.\u201d Karen sighed. \u201cYou looked guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Rafe wants, he gets.\u201d Karen\u2019s voice roughened. \u201cHe wanted to turn the tables on the Bureau that was hunting his kind, so now he has the list of names.\u201d Her eyes were on Lucas. \u201cHe wanted revenge on the man who killed his father, and now he\u2019s got you in his sights.\u201d</p><p>What? Was that supposed to make Lucas suspicious of her? What kind of game was Karen spinning?</p><p>Sarah glanced out the back window. No other cars. Just a line of trees. \u201cStop the damn van!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>The van squealed to a halt.</p><p>The demon flew forward.</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t move. He just watched Sarah.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the trap, Karen?\u201d Sarah demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal? We\u2019re not heading to Lucas\u2019s, this isn\u2019t the right road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas said immediately.</p><p>The driver shoved open his door and ran.</p><p>Sarah surged forward. Lucas caught her hand. \u201cLet him go,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere for him to run here.\u201d</p><p>But where was here?</p><p>\u201cCoyote land,\u201d Lucas said, as if reading her mind.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>He laughed at the expression on Karen\u2019s face. \u201cDid you really think I didn\u2019t hear the beep of the transmitter beneath the van? I knew where the asshole was taking us. Guess that was the plan, though, right? Lure me in, keep me trapped. Take me to a slaughter.\u201d He shoved open the back doors, letting in the setting sun. Soon, darkness would be calling. \u201cThe thing is, agent, I wanted you to take me to the bastard. Why the hell do you think I followed your bread crumbs? Why do you think I ever got in the van?\u201d</p><p>Karen didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Lucas pointed one claw at the demon. \u201cBy the way, Marley, did you really think I was dumb enough not to spot you on sight?\u201d</p><p>Marley.</p><p>Once more, the demon\u2019s image began to waver.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Now Karen was the one sweating.</p><p>\u201cYou look different, Marley, but the scent is the same. With you, it always is. Glamour\u2019s only skin-deep, right?\u201d</p><p>The dark hair lengthened, sliding past the demon\u2019s shoulders. The face softened, the hard edges slipping away. The cheekbones stretched higher. The lips plumped. In bare seconds, the man was gone.</p><p>And the demon who\u2019d left Sarah to burn was back. \u201cDemons didn\u2019t send you to watch my ass,\u201d Lucas said. He grabbed Sarah\u2019s hand and they jumped from the van.</p><p>Marley sprang after them, with Karen right at her side. \u201cLucas!\u201d Now the demon\u2019s voice was feminine. So she\u2019d changed that, too? \u201cI wasn\u2019t given a choice, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted someone to keep tabs on my pack, right, Karen?\u201d Lucas drawled. \u201cAnd like Marley said, she knew my weak spot.\u201d</p><p>Sarah had read the profile on him, too. Because of his past, Lucas had a protective streak. A soft spot for victims.</p><p>A lump rose in her throat. I used that weakness against him, too.</p><p>Did he realize?</p><p>His mocking smile said he did. Lucas.</p><p>His gaze drifted to the darkening woods. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone out here, you know.\u201d</p><p>Sarah already had the gun out and in her hands. This time, she had it aimed at the demon.</p><p>\u201cBack away from her, Karen.\u201d</p><p>But Karen moved closer to Marley. \u201cShe\u2019s on our side. Dammit, if you\u2019d both just calm down, I could explain! She really is an agent. Marley Dulane is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t care to learn anything else about the demon. She already knew what mattered. \u201cShe told the coyotes about John. She watched him die.\u201d</p><p>Karen\u2019s lips parted. \u201cBut . . . no, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack away, Karen!\u201d Because there was a traitor in the Bureau, all right, and Sarah was looking right at her.</p><p>Karen began to edge away from the demon.</p><p>Just not fast enough.</p><p>Two coyotes sprang from the bushes and launched at Lucas.</p><p>The demon bent down low, then rose in a flash, driving her fist right into Karen\u2019s stomach.</p><p>The agent screamed and punched out, even as Sarah fired the bullet.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Too damn late.</p><p>The demon had already jumped back and Karen fell to the ground, the handle of an all-too-familiar knife buried in her stomach.</p><p>My weapon. \u201cKaren!\u201d</p><p>Snarls and growls filled the air even as Karen\u2019s blood pooled on the ground.</p><p>The demon laughed. \u201cWhen they find the body, they\u2019ll know you killed her.\u201d</p><p>Sarah rushed to Karen. The agent was still alive, but blood trickled from her lips.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll be dead, too . . .\u201d Marley\u2019s voice promised. Sarah whipped the gun up, ready to fire, but the fast bitch had already run into the woods. Sarah knew the demon was just biding her time. Watching, waiting to attack.</p><p>With what? More fire?</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>The two coyotes circled Lucas, and he slashed out at them with his claws. He hadn\u2019t shifted, and she knew he couldn\u2019t shift. Because in the time it took to shift, they could kill him.</p><p>The hell they would.</p><p>Smoke began to fill the air. Bitch.</p><p>Sarah narrowed her eyes as she took aim.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hit your lover . . .\u201d Marley sang out. \u201cBut, of course, you like to hurt your lovers, don\u2019t you, Sarah?\u201d</p><p>Karen choked, and her body heaved.</p><p>Sarah fired, catching one coyote in the shoulder. The bastard howled and turned his stare on her.</p><p>Hayden. Like she\u2019d ever forget those eyes. That bright circle of yellow gleamed in the darkness of his stare.</p><p>He growled, then he leapt toward her.</p><p>Sarah squeezed the trigger once more. This time, the bullet blasted right between his eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even have time to whimper.</p><p>But the other coyote did. Lucas had driven his claws into the animal\u2019s side and now the coyote was down, jerking and heaving and twisting.</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d He had to move so she could get a clear shot. \u201cI can\u2019t get the\u2014\u201d</p><p>A line of fire burst from the woods. Flames that separated her from Lucas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn demon.</p><p>\u201cS-Sarah . . .\u201d Karen grabbed her hand. \u201cD-don\u2019t let me . . . die out here . . .\u201d</p><p>Sarah glanced down at Karen. They\u2019d been friends once. Hadn\u2019t they? She\u2019d worked with Karen on three cases. They\u2019d laughed. Traded stories.</p> <p>But never met outside of work.</p><p>Never talked about anything personal.</p><p>Hell, she didn\u2019t even know if Karen was the woman\u2019s real name.</p><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t want to d-die . . . out here . . .\u201d Karen\u2019s fingers squeezed hers.</p><p>The fire closed in.</p> <p>\u201cSarah! Fuck, Sarah, jump over the flames! There\u2019s time!\u201d Lucas\u2019s roar. Her head whipped up. He\u2019d taken out the other coyote.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t leave her.\u201d Because, dammit, she had a weakness, too. They\u2019d probably profiled her at the FBI, just like they had Lucas. If she was really a suspect like Karen had said, the profile would have been one of their first investigative tactics, and Marley would\u2019ve had access to that profile.</p><p>Using my weakness against me.</p><p>Sarah stood, trying to drag Karen to her feet.</p><p>The other woman groaned, pain heavy in the sound. Sarah started to lift her. She could try a fireman\u2019s carry, she could\u2014</p><p>Lucas leapt through the flames. The scent of burned flesh rose, clogging her nostrils. No, Lucas!</p> <p>\u201cGet in the damn van.\u201d</p><p>She jumped inside, pulling Karen with her.</p><p>\u201cStop the fucking fire, Marley!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>But Marley didn\u2019t stop the fire. The flames just flared higher and they closed in tighter.</p><p>Lucas ran to the front of the van. Jumped inside. \u201cThe bastard took the keys!\u201d</p><p>Shit. Now they were trapped. Sarah covered her mouth and yanked the back doors closed. So much smoke.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, babe. I got this.\u201d Her head whipped around. He\u2019d bent under the dash.</p><p>One moment. Two . . . The motor revved to life. He slammed on the gas and the van lurched forward. Sarah saw a wall of flames waiting on them. Bigger, so big now . . .</p> <p>They went right through the fire.</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t even have time to scream. The van blasted through the flames. The windshield cracked, rubber burned, and they were free.</p><p>Lucas jerked the wheel and the van streaked to the left. \u201cHow much longer does she have?\u201d</p><p>Karen\u2019s eyes were closed. Her blood soaked Sarah\u2019s clothing. Sarah touched the wound and Karen didn\u2019t wince. Sarah wasn\u2019t even sure Karen had felt her touch. Too far gone. \u201cShe needs a hospital and she needs one now.\u201d</p><p>No, what she really needed was a miracle.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s gaze met hers in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to stop the blood.\u201d Her hands were so red and the blood flow wouldn\u2019t stop. \u201cWe have to get her to a doctor. She\u2019s not going to make it if\u2014\u201d</p><p>If he stopped. If he went back for Marley and whoever else waited in the woods. Sarah couldn\u2019t get Karen to a hospital on her own. She needed him to drive so she could keep the pressure on the wound.</p><p>She needed him.</p><p>He needed vengeance.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Lucas. She\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>Did he even care? What would a human\u2019s death matter to him? Just a human. A dead stranger.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that what she could have been?</p><p>The van\u2019s engine roared. \u201cWe\u2019ll be at Saints Hospital in ten minutes.\u201d His gaze met hers. \u201cCan you keep her alive that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t let . . .\u201d Karen whispered and a tear streaked from her eye.</p><p>Sarah swallowed down the fear that had risen in her throat. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make it.\u201d Not a lie. Not really.</p><p>\u201cSarah?\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice growled.</p><p>\u201cI can keep her alive.\u201d I hope. \u201cBut, dammit, drive fast.\u201d Because she didn\u2019t think she had ten minutes. From the look of things, Karen barely had any time at all.</p><p>Don\u2019t die on me.</p><p>But Karen\u2019s eyes were already closed.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Lucas braked right next to the hospital\u2019s emergency-room doors. He jumped out of the van and raced around to the back, shouting for the guard on duty to get help.</p><p>Shit, couldn\u2019t he tell when there was a damn emergency? Humans.</p><p>He yanked open the back door and hoisted Karen into his arms. Her head sagged back against him and her blood . . . so much blood.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s gaze met his. \u201cHer heart\u2019s barely beating.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. He spun on his heel and ran for the sliding glass doors. The guard was just coming out of the doors, a gurney beside him, two guys with stethoscopes hauling ass with him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been stabbed!\u201d He yelled but thought that should be obvious. The stab wound had been perfectly placed for maximum damage.</p><p>Lucas put her on the gurney. The agent\u2019s eyes never opened. The docs swarmed her.</p><p>\u201cSir, you\u2019ve got to come inside.\u201d The guard grabbed his arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to call the cops, file a report\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t move. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The doctors had Karen inside now. They\u2019d do what they could for her. If she lived . . . if she died . . .</p><p>He turned away, breaking the guard\u2019s hold.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave!\u201d The guard didn\u2019t make the mistake of touching him again. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sarah had climbed from the van. Blood covered her.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit! Ma\u2019am, hold on!\u201d The guard streaked past Lucas and caught Sarah\u2019s hands. \u201cYou should\u2019ve said there were two victims!\u201d</p><p>Sarah shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not hurt.\u201d She stared down at her hands. At all the blood.</p><p>Not hurt. This time. But next time, she could be.</p><p>The wolf inside howled. Not fucking next time. No one would hurt her. No one.</p><p>\u201cCome inside, ma\u2019am,\u201d the guard said, trying to tug her closer. \u201cCome inside, you need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman they took inside is a federal agent.\u201d Lucas pulled Sarah away from the man, deliberately keeping his hold gentle with her. Even though she wasn\u2019t an average human, she was as weak physically as the agent, he knew that. So why the hell couldn\u2019t he be easier with her?</p><p>Because I need her. Too much.</p><p>The wolf within craved her as much as the man did. \u201cCall Anthony Miller at the Bureau . . . tell him the victim\u2019s Karen Phillips.\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice was whisper-soft.</p><p>\u201cThe\u2014the FBI?\u201d</p><p>Lucas steered Sarah toward the front of the van. She moved quickly, jumping into the passenger seat.</p><p>The guard scrambled back. Lucas cast one last glance toward the brightly-lit hospital. That agent had been so far gone. No mambo was around to save her. Would the doctors be able to do enough?</p><p>He climbed into the van.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to report the license plate number,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cThe cops will be after us in no time. Especially if they think we\u2019re the ones who stabbed Karen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He gunned the engine and raced past an ambulance. \u201cWe\u2019ll ditch the van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t . . . I . . .\u201d The rasp of her breath filled the vehicle\u2019s interior. \u201cI need to get the blood off, Lucas.\u201d A pleading note had entered her voice. \u201cPlease . . . I need to get the blood off my hands.\u201d</p><p>Some blood wouldn\u2019t wash clean.</p><p>But he drove faster, snaking through the lanes. Heading deeper into the heart of the city.</p><p>There.</p><p>The rundown hotel waited just off the highway. A place where no one asked questions, because the folks damn well knew better than to make that mistake. The owner was a shifter who\u2019d spent years lying to human cops.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he told her, and ran into what counted as the main office of the place. His fist slammed down onto the bell. Shit. He had blood on his hands, too. The scent had been so strong on Sarah, he hadn\u2019t even realized . . .</p><p>A key was shoved across the scarred desktop. \u201cTwenty for an hour.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the money onto the countertop and swiped the key. The fox shifter had to see and smell the blood. But in that place, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time.</p><p>Or the last.</p><p>Lucas tossed out an extra hundred. \u201cI\u2019ve got a van that needs to disappear.\u201d</p><p>The fox\u2019s palm covered the money. \u201cConsider it gone, Alpha.\u201d</p><p>He spun away and hurried back outside. Room seven. The room the fox always gave him when the pack needed to clean up.</p><p>How much blood have I washed away?</p><p>But, damn it, he hadn\u2019t killed innocents. He\u2019d taken out the bastards who\u2019d come after him. He\u2019d protected his pack. And if he had to . . . hell, yeah, he\u2019d do it again.</p><p>Sarah shoved open the door when she saw him. Beautiful Sarah. She could have stayed out of this life. Could have passed for normal.</p><p>He glanced toward the side of the building. The fox was already heading for the van. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d clenched her hands, probably trying to hide the blood. Didn\u2019t do much good though, not when her clothes were covered in dark red.</p><p>He pushed the key into the lock and the door swung open seconds later. The place was a dump, no getting around it, but it had a shower and soap and he could make certain Sarah got what she wanted.</p><p>I need to get the blood off my hands.</p><p>Oh, yeah. He understood. Been there, babe. Done that.</p><p>She brushed by him, stopping only long enough to put her gun on the nightstand before she walked toward the bathroom. Sarah yanked her clothes off as she went, dropping the bloody shirt, kicking out of her shoes and socks, and ditching her jeans.</p><p>She disappeared into the small bathroom and the roar of the shower filled the motel room. Lucas\u2019s gaze tracked around the area. Sagging bed. Scarred nightstand. Not much else. No TV because the folks who came to this place weren\u2019t real big on staying and relaxing.</p><p>He glanced at his hands. Would the human agent live? Marley sure wouldn\u2019t. Not when he got his hands on her.</p><p>He stalked to the phone and dialed quickly. Dane answered on the second ring. \u201cWhere the hell are you?\u201d the other shifter asked at once.</p><p>His gaze tracked to the peeling ceiling. Hell was a pretty good description. \u201cLangdon\u2019s.\u201d The name of that cagey fox. Dane would know the place. He\u2019d cleaned up there often enough. No telling how much blood this room had seen. He exhaled. \u201cWe need a team on Prentmore.\u201d</p><p>A low whistle. \u201cThat\u2019s close to where Jess and his coyotes made their base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s where you\u2019ll find two more dead coyotes. But they\u2019re not the priority.\u201d His gaze locked on Sarah\u2019s gun. \u201cThey can fucking rot. I need a nose to search the scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose scent are we after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell was she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s FBI.\u201d Who wasn\u2019t? \u201cAnd she\u2019s also been the one working with Rafe.\u201d The agent who\u2019d flipped. Not Sarah. Not Karen. The demon who\u2019d been right under his nose. \u201cFind her, follow her scent, and let me know which hole she crawls into.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d drag her out, and when he did, he\u2019d find Rafe.</p><p>Lucas exhaled, feeling the aches in his muscles. \u201cHas Caleb talked yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet . . . he\u2019s still out.\u201d</p><p>There is no cure. \u201cGet out to Prentmore.\u201d He could count on Dane. He\u2019d track the demon. \u201cBut don\u2019t take Marley out, got me? No matter what she says or does, she\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d lead him to Rafe.</p><p>He ended the call, his hands yanking at his shirt. The water was still running and he wasn\u2019t going to leave Sarah in there alone.</p><p>Crave her.</p><p>Need her.</p><p>He was naked by the time he crossed the threshold into the bathroom. Steam curled in the air, and he could see the outline of Sarah\u2019s body behind the thin shower curtain.</p><p>For a moment, he just watched her. She had bent her head beneath the spray and her shoulders seemed to shake a little. Fuck. Was she crying?</p><p>He yanked the curtain back. She didn\u2019t whirl around in surprise. Didn\u2019t even look up. Lucas climbed in behind her. When the water hit him, the clear liquid changed to red as the blood washed from his body.</p><p>He didn\u2019t touch her. Not yet. Lucas didn\u2019t want to touch her with the blood still on his hands. He grabbed the soap. Lathered and scrubbed until his flesh was clean.</p><p>Sarah moved forward, letting more of the spray hit him. The water stung a bit. She had it on full-blast and it was hot and it was just what he needed.</p><p>The red water slowly drained away. His hands looked clean again. What a lie.</p><p>But he reached for her anyway now. Lucas wrapped his arms around Sarah and pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, it seems like I don\u2019t know who to trust anymore.\u201d Her whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou can trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to trust you for this to work.\u201d She turned in his arms, facing him. Her head tilted back. Her black lashes were wet, spiky. From the shower or tears? Probably from both. \u201cYou told me that before.\u201d</p><p>It was still true now.</p><p>\u201cBut do you trust me?\u201d She asked him, then shook her head. Her hands curled around his shoulders. \u201cAfter everything, how could you?\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled. He bent close and brought his mouth over hers. \u201cTrust me,\u201d the words probably shouldn\u2019t have come out as an order, but they did. His mouth took hers, and his tongue thrust deep.</p><p>She moaned in her throat and her nails bit into him. Trust me.</p><p>He yanked tight onto his control. This time, he\u2019d show her that he could be more than just the beast the world thought he was.</p><p>For her.</p><p>He forced his head to lift. Her eyes were big and deep. Eyes that a man could probably lose his soul in\u2014if he had a soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sold mine long ago.</p><p>Blood.

She opened her arms, almost immediately, reaching for him.</p><p>Worth it?</p><p>He went to her and knew that nothing would keep him away from her. Not now.

Blood, death . . . didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d wanted her.</p><p>Would have killed to have her.</p><p>The thought didn\u2019t give him any pause. After all, he\u2019d known for a while now that he\u2019d be killing for Sarah.</p><p>The towel had come loose and her nipples\u2014tight, hard peaks that looked like perfect cherries\u2014waited for him. He licked her nipple, the sound of her moans filling his ears.</p><p>Gentle.</p><p>His claws dug into the sheets.</p> <p>He took her breast into his mouth. Sucked. Licked. The taste of her spilled onto his tongue. So fucking sweet. So . . . Sarah.</p><p>His breath blew over her nipple.</p><p>\u201cLucas . . .\u201d</p><p>He turned his attention to the other breast.</p><p>The edge of his teeth scraped over her flesh.</p><p>She gasped, jerking.</p><p>Control.</p><p>His mouth left her flesh.</p> <p>\u201cNo! No, Lucas, I liked\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her stomach. Worked his way down her body, touching her with his mouth and tongue, caressing. Her legs parted for him and the scent of her arousal filled his nose and drove him wild.</p><p>Control.</p><p>\u201cOpen your legs wider.\u201d His voice was a growl. Dammit.</p><p>But she opened her legs wider. She brought her hands between their bodies, and she used her fingertips to part her sex for him. \u201cKiss me, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, yes.</p><p>He did. His lips took her. He sucked her clitoris, used his tongue to taste and to take and her breath came faster, hitching, gasping as her lips lifted and she pressed closer to him.</p><p>He drove his tongue inside of her.</p><p>Her hands were in his hair now, urging him closer and she was saying . . .</p><p>\u201cI want you, Lucas! Oh, yes, now, come on, I need you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was starving for her. So he took more. More.</p><p>She came against his mouth. Her whole body tensed and a broken scream ripped from her throat. But he didn\u2019t stop. Couldn\u2019t. Because he had to have\u2014</p><p>More.</p><p>His claws dug deeper into the mattress.</p><p>She trembled, whispering his name, and his mouth pressed against her. He\u2019d take everything she\u2019d give to him. Every damn thing.</p><p>So fucking sweet.</p><p>He waited until the shudders eased, until her nails pulled free from his flesh, then he rose up. Sweat slickened his back. His muscles were so tight and his cock felt like it was about to burst.</p><p>Take her.</p><p>The head of his cock lodged at her creamy core. He still had control\u2014barely\u2014he could do this right, he could\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The word stopped him cold. Every muscle in his body locked and a distant roaring filled his ears. \u201cSarah?\u201d She was turning him away? Now?</p><p>She pushed against his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing this to me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d tried to be gentle. Tried to show her that he was more than an animal. Couldn\u2019t she see that?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s giving this time, Lucas.\u201d Her eyes sparkled at him. A red flush stained her cheeks and her plump lips firmed. \u201cThis time, I\u2019ll give to you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands circled his wrists. His claws were still lodged in the mattress. Right then, he didn\u2019t want her to see . . . him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered and pulled his wrists. She didn\u2019t look at his claws.</p><p>Sarah pushed him onto the mattress. She rose above him. Her scent surrounded him, and he just wanted to take and take.</p><p>But he was more than an animal.</p><p>Her hands trailed down his chest and his cock jerked.</p><p>More than an animal\u2014right?</p><p>Her lips feathered over his jaw. \u201cI want to know everything about you, Lucas. I want to touch everything.\u201d She nipped his chin. \u201cI can handle you. I might not be a shifter, but I can handle you.\u201d</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t. If his control shattered, if the wolf ever took over and he became psychotic, there was no way she\u2019d be able handle him. No one could. Wolves that pushed past that boundary were put down. Pack law. The law he\u2019d directed because he\u2019d seen what happened when madness ruled.</p><p>\u201cI know so much about you,\u201d she told him, her voice like sin in the dark. \u201cMore than you realize.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been FBI. Was there anything she didn\u2019t know? Her breasts pressed against his chest, the nipples still tight and hard, and he growled.</p><p>She licked the skin just under his jaw. \u201cAll your life, you had to be the strong one.\u201d Her lips kissed a path up his jaw. She licked his right earlobe.</p><p>Lucas tensed. \u201cSarah, don\u2019t.\u201d Because she didn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>Her mouth whispered over the torn remains of his ear, kissing lightly. Such soft, tender kisses.</p><p>\u201cYou were too young for so much pain.\u201d</p><p>No. He wouldn\u2019t remember. He grabbed her hips and yanked her close.</p><p>But she kissed his ear again. \u201cEverything you\u2019ve done,\u201d she told him, the words a breath in his ear. \u201cJust made you stronger.\u201d</p><p>There was no revulsion from her. Her mouth pressed against the torn edges of flesh. \u201cSo strong.\u201d</p><p>Sarah. \u201cI want you, now.\u201d The wolf was fighting free. The man didn\u2019t want to hold him back. The hot clasp of her sex was too close, pleasure waiting\u2014within his reach. Release. Hunger. Her.</p><p>She pulled back and stared into his eyes. \u201cThey whisper about you. In the other packs, they talk about the alpha who should have died years ago. The boy who proved to be stronger than the wolves after him.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been strong. He\u2019d been desperate. He\u2019d had to go back and protect his friend. Dane\u2014they\u2019d tortured Dane, sliced him to pieces because he wouldn\u2019t betray\u2014</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you going back to that place right now.\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice had his eyes rising up to meet hers. She licked her lips. \u201cNo pain now, okay? Only pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Then she eased down his body, her hair sliding over his skin. Just like silk. Soft and sensual and so cool, while her mouth\u2014</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Her mouth closed around the tip of his cock. Hot and wet and she took him inside, sucking and licking.</p><p>\u201cSarah!\u201d A roar.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop. Her mouth widened and she took him in deeper. Her lips closed around him and her palm curved around the base of his cock. Her hand squeezed him, pumped and her mouth tasted and tasted\u2014</p><p>His hips arched up, and his cock drove into her mouth. So damn good. She was taking him in, pulling at his flesh and the pleasure had his spine tightening and his chest burning. He was going to come in her mouth. Fuck.</p><p>Her tongue swirled over the head of his cock and she swallowed.</p><p>He caught her arms\u2014too rough, slow down, ease up\u2014and pushed her back. His hands were shaking with a need too strong to ignore. \u201cIn you . . . got to be buried in you . . .\u201d He could hardly get the words out. His voice was far more wolf-growl than anything else.</p><p>But Sarah understood. She always understood. She smiled at him and she climbed up his body, straddling his hips. Her creamy flesh teased his cock.</p><p>Take it easy, go slow, not too deep\u2014</p><p>\u201cHard, Lucas. Hard and wild and deep.\u201d</p><p>His control shattered and he surged into her as deeply as he could. His fingers bit into her hips. He lifted her up and down, forcing her to match the speed of his thrusts.</p><p>But she was laughing and driving down with her body and meeting him thrust for thrust. Her sex closed around him, so tight, so hot, and she squeezed his cock.</p><p>He lowered her onto the bed and caught her hands, pinning them to the bed. Her gaze met his. No fear. Just need. Animal need.</p><p>Lust.</p><p>But...</p><p>More. Desire. Hunger. Passion.</p><p>Trust?</p><p>\u201cMore, Lucas.\u201d She arched her neck. Her heels dug into his ass. \u201cMore!\u201d</p><p>He gave her more. The bed squeaked and slammed into the wall. His heart thundered in his chest. He drove into her, again and again, deeper, so deep, and the feel of her sex squeezing him was fucking fantastic. His mouth pressed against her throat. Pressed over the pulse that raced so fast.</p><p>He could taste her lust.</p><p>He licked her. Let her feel the edge of his teeth.</p><p>She shuddered against him, but didn\u2019t tell him to stop. Didn\u2019t fight\u2014no, she pushed her throat to his mouth. She wanted him.</p><p>Everything.</p><p>He found her sweet spot, the soft curve where neck and shoulder met. Lucas bit.</p><p>She came beneath him, a hard ripple of her sex that stroked every inch of his cock.</p><p>She came and he bit her again, and the need broke free. He surged into her, drove deep, and let the pleasure rip through him.</p><p>When he climaxed, when his body shook and he pumped into her core, he finally realized the truth.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t just kill for Sarah King.</p><p>Very slowly, Lucas lifted his head and he stared at the mark he\u2019d made on her flesh. A claiming mark. The way of the wolf. His gaze met hers. Sated green. Wide open, seeing all of him, accepting all.</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t just kill for her.</p><p>If he had to, he\u2019d fucking die for her.</p><p>After all, it wasn\u2019t every day that a wolf found his mate. And when he found her, he knew to hold on tight.</p><p>Because if he lost her, only madness would be left.</p><p>The scent of blood was like a punch in the face. Dane narrowed his eyes as he studied the bodies still lying on the twisting road. No big surprise that the dead shifters hadn\u2019t been found by someone else. Most folks stayed the hell off this road.</p><p>It was known to be a hunting ground. Humans who got lost on this trek didn\u2019t always make it back out. And the Other, they either came there to hunt or to die.</p><p>The coyotes had been there to hunt, but the dumb sonsofbitches had wound up prey.</p><p>\u201cA silver bullet right between the eyes,\u201d Jordan said, staring down at the body. \u201cYeah, that\u2019ll take you out, no matter if you\u2019re coyote or wolf.\u201d He glanced up at Dane. \u201cSarah\u2019s a good shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lucas is a fucking brutal killer.\u201d He turned away from the younger shifter and stared at the remains of the other coyote. Rage had been riding Lucas hard when he\u2019d made this kill. Because the assholes had threatened Sarah?</p><p>Did the guy even realize how important she\u2019d become to him? Maybe, if he was smart, he did.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s from Marley\u2019s fire.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s gaze tracked to the right. The demon had sure been burning wild. Those scorchmarks were all over the place. The scent of ash lingered in the air, tangling with the blood. He inhaled, drawing the scents in deeper. He\u2019d have to get past the blood and fire first, then he\u2019d find Marley. He\u2019d get a lock on her and run the demon down.</p><p>His eyes closed and he inhaled.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Dane\u2019s eyes flew open. His heart had kicked hard in his chest and his claws burst out.</p><p>\u201cDane? What is it? What\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the silver knife that had been tossed onto the side of the road. He barely felt the burn on his hand.</p><p>\u201cDrop that, Dane!\u201d Jordan shoved at his hand. \u201cAre you crazy? That\u2019s silver!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s blood all over the place out here. Now let\u2019s get the bodies moved and find that demon.\u201d</p><p>Dane shook his head. \u201cHer blood.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMarley? You\u2019ve already got a lock on her?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Marley\u2019s blood. \u201cLucas didn\u2019t tell me she was here.\u201d</p><p>Jordan tensed.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, he told us to come and get Marley, what the hell are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren!\u201d Not Marley. He didn\u2019t give a shit about her.</p><p>\u201cHer blood\u2014it\u2019s everywhere.\u201d Too much blood. Human blood. He\u2019d never forget her scent.</p><p>\u201cKaren?\u201d Jordan grabbed Dane\u2019s fist and ripped the knife away. He hissed out a breath at the scorch of the silver and tossed the weapon into the woods. \u201cThat woman you found with the coyotes?\u201d</p><p>The thunder of his heartbeat filled Dane\u2019s ears. \u201cSarah\u2019s knife was used on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Marley?\u201d Jordan shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re losing me here.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s teeth snapped together. \u201cOn Karen.\u201d She\u2019d been attacked but she was gone now. No body. Just blood. Was she alive? What the hell had happened out there?</p><p>Trap.</p><p>Karen had worked with the coyotes before. Had she been in on the attack? Had Sarah fought back and stabbed her? Was she dead?</p><p>\u201cDammit, I don\u2019t know!\u201d Jordan yelled, grabbing his shoulders and Dane realized he\u2019d been snarling his questions. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to find her.\u201d Jordan shook him. \u201cWe\u2019re here to find Marley. Dammit, Mar-ley. The demon bitch that is after my brother, our pack. Karen . . .\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. She doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>She does to me. \u201cOnly two people really matter to you.\u201d The words flew out. \u201cLucas and Cammie.\u201d Oh, he knew all about Jordan. The wolf who\u2019d left them a boy and come back a broken man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Got to be broken to see it.</p><p>He\u2019d seen it. When the vampires had taken Jordan, he\u2019d changed. Lost the light he\u2019d held for years and finally become as dark and dangerous as the rest of his pack.</p><p>And as for Camellia, or . . . Cammie as Jordan called her\u2014Dane knew all about her, too. She\u2019d been taken by the vamps just as Jordan had, and during their captivity, Jordan had become the girl\u2019s protector. In the years that had passed, Jordan still snuck away to see her, when he didn\u2019t think anyone was watching. But Dane was always watching. He knew all about Jordan\u2019s little obsession. Still young, but Cammie was growing up fast. Was Jordan counting down the days?</p> <p>Jordan\u2019s eyelids flickered and rage burned bright in his stare. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about. If you\u2019re not going to find the demon, I will.\u201d</p><p>Then he spun away and headed for the woods.</p><p>Jordan had a good sense of smell, no doubt, but picking up the demon wasn\u2019t gonna be easy.</p><p>Then Jordan started running. Maybe it was that easy. Where was Karen\u2019s body? No body meant she could still be alive.</p><p>And why does it matter? The woman had trapped him, taunted him . . . and\u2014</p> <p>And I fucking want her alive.</p><p>He chased after Jordan. He couldn\u2019t leave the other wolf alone. If he did, Lucas would skin him alive.</p><p>A burst of speed sent him through the bushes. Branches clawed at him, but he shoved them out of the way. It didn\u2019t take him long to catch the scent Jordan was following.</p><p>No way to miss the scent of the dead.</p><p>He jumped over a fallen tree, snaked to the right and burst into a clearing.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t have a damn chance,\u201d Jordan shook his head and stared at the body.</p> <p>Not Karen. There wasn\u2019t a whole lot that you could tell about those burned remains, but the scent was wrong. Whoever had died right there\u2014it hadn\u2019t been his redhead.</p><p>\u201cMarley\u2019s work.\u201d Obviously. Dane\u2019s gaze lifted and scanned the scene. His nostrils twitched. Marley had made a mistake. Most demons were hard to track, but a demon who\u2019d been playing with fire . . .</p><p>He inhaled.</p><p>. . . a demon who\u2019d been playing with fire might as well have left a trail of ash to follow.</p><p>He and Jordan turned as one and rushed to the left. The demon wouldn\u2019t get away from them, and she\u2019d soon find out that wolves weren\u2019t afraid of a demon\u2019s fire.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been sixteen years,\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice rumbled beneath \u201cher ear and Sarah slowly lifted her head. \u201cBut sometimes I feel like I can still smell my father\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>A chill skated over her skin.</p> <p>\u201cHell, I didn\u2019t even know a rival alpha was in town, not until I came home,\u201d he said quietly \u201cand found my father struggling to shift. Kaber had cut his throat open, nearly taken his head, and no matter how hard he tried, my father couldn\u2019t shift to heal. Then . . . Kaber came over and finished the job. To make sure my father was good and dead, he took his head.\u201d</p><p>A sure-fire way to kill just about any paranormal out there. Sarah swallowed and pushed up onto her arms, bracing on his chest as she stared into his eyes. In the darkness, she couldn\u2019t see much. But that blue stare seemed to shine. And really, he was all she needed to see.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard was in my house before my father\u2019s body was even cold.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak because Sarah wanted to hear this.</p><p>\u201cThe scent of his blood clogged my nostrils. And that bastard Kaber laughed when he saw me.\u201d</p><p>Her hands began to stroke his chest. She knew this moment was important. Lucas trusted her enough to tell her about his past. You can trust me. I won\u2019t betray you.</p><p>\u201cSomething broke in me. Everything was red, just like my father\u2019s blood. So much red. So much rage. I . . . attacked.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t cry. Ten. He\u2019d been just ten.</p><p>\u201cKaber shifted and came after me as a wolf. Hell, I knew I didn\u2019t have a chance, but my father\u2019s body was there. Right there, and I wasn\u2019t just gonna let that asshole take over. The wolves from my father\u2019s pack\u2014they weren\u2019t doing a damn thing. Just standing back, watching Kaber, watching him take everything away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one tried to help you?\u201d Damn them.</p><p>\u201cDane.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cAfter Kaber bit half my ear off, Dane attacked him from behind. Dane was only eight then, but he came out, flying on Kaber\u2019s back. He gave me the chance I needed.\u201d</p><p>His fingers smoothed down her arms. \u201cMy claws broke free. They shouldn\u2019t . . . it was too early for a full shift but I guess the adrenaline pushed me over the edge. My claws came out, and I slashed the bastard, I dug my claws as deep into his side as they could go.\u201d A rough laugh. \u201cThat didn\u2019t stop him. It barely slowed him down. He tossed Dane aside and came back after me.\u201d</p><p>Silence. She hated silence. Her hand pressed over his heart. The beat was slow, steady. \u201cHow did you get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to fucking run. He would have killed me. I would have died right next to my father, lost my head . . . for a pack that wouldn\u2019t stand up for me.\u201d</p><p>Except for Dane.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t leave the city right away.\u201d</p><p>Now this was part of the story that she\u2019d never heard. \u201cSome demons in the area owed my father, and they paid his debt to me. They gave me shelter and helped to hide my scent.\u201d His fingers curled over her shoulder. \u201cAnd when they got wind of what was happening to Dane, they told me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to know, but she asked anyway. \u201cWhat did Kaber do to him?\u201d Those scars . . .</p><p>\u201cHe started clawing the flesh off Dane\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>Her gut clenched. \u201cBut he was eight, he couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaber knew Dane couldn\u2019t heal, that\u2019s why he did it. Kaber was sending a message to the pack. Either you were with him or you were one of the assholes he\u2019d torture.\u201d</p><p>Sarah sat up in bed, dragging the sheet with her, but she kept her hand on Lucas. She needed to keep touching him. \u201cGuess there\u2019s no doubt Kaber was crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust another psychotic wolf,\u201d Lucas murmured.</p><p>Okay, now she wished she could see more in the darkness because she would\u2019ve loved to catch his expression. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went back for him.\u201d Spoken as if there had been no other option. \u201cTwo demons took me up there. They wouldn\u2019t go in, but I didn\u2019t need them to. I knew every inch of that place. Still do.\u201d</p><p>Because the wolf compound was his father\u2019s old home. She\u2019d known that, but hadn\u2019t realized just how much that truly meant . . .</p><p>\u201cI found Dane and I carried him out. I got him the hell out of there and we didn\u2019t look back.\u201d</p><p>But, no, wait, he had gone back. He\u2019d grown up and then he\u2019d gone after Kaber and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have ever gone back, Sarah. Those assholes in the pack turned their backs on me. Together, we could have fought Kaber but . . .\u201d Now he rose, pulling from the bed, leaving her cold and alone with only the too-thin sheet. \u201cThen when I was sixteen, I met a demon named Trace in a shit-forsaken bar in Mexico.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t even surprised to find out that he\u2019d been in a bar at sixteen. Not like the normal rules of society had ever applied to him.</p><p>\u201cSeems this demon had been in LA. He\u2019d seen Kaber\u2019s pack, and he\u2019d noticed a kid there\u2014a black-haired, golden-eyed kid who looked, according to Trace, one hell of a lot like me.\u201d</p><p>Jordan. \u201cYou didn\u2019t . . . you didn\u2019t know about him when you left.\u201d Well, hell, wasn\u2019t that obvious?</p><p>\u201cMy mother gave birth to me and then she left the pack.\u201d No emotion there. \u201cAt least, I thought she\u2019d left, but it turns out she came back a few times over the years. I just didn\u2019t know about her little visits.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d come back and she\u2019d gotten pregnant again.</p><p>\u201cShe dumped Jordan just like she dumped me, only my dad wasn\u2019t around to keep him safe. She left the kid with Kaber. Kaber.\u201d His fist slammed into the wall and she realized just how fake his calm actually was.</p><p>Sarah licked her lips. \u201cYou went back for him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went back for everything that was mine. My brother, my house, my pack.\u201d She saw the big shadow of his body stalk to the window. He peered out between the blinds. \u201cI went back for it all, and I made sure Kaber suffered for everything he\u2019d done to me.\u201d</p><p>Yes, this part she knew. He\u2019d gone back and given a hard, painful death to Kaber. Everyone at the FBI had known how the story ended, too. That\u2019s why he\u2019d been put on the extermination list. A brutal kill at sixteen\u2014they\u2019d just expected more blood and death to keep coming from him. \u201cAnd what about the wolves?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe shifters who\u2019d been part of your father\u2019s pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a few were left alive by then.\u201d A rough laugh.</p><p>\u201cImagine that. Packs are supposed to keep you safe, but with Kaber, just a few were left, and they hauled ass fast enough when I came back on the scene.\u201d</p><p>Because they probably had expected Lucas to kill them. \u201cSo you started a new pack.\u201d</p><p>The blinds fell back into place. \u201cI started my pack. With Jordan and Dane, and when we found others, we brought them in.\u201d</p><p>Always protecting. Always strong.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your mother?\u201d She voiced the question that nagged at her mind.</p><p>\u201cI heard she died a few years back.\u201d</p><p>Sarah slid from the bed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I never knew her. She ditched me as fast as she could because she didn\u2019t want to be tied down\u2014\u201d</p><p>She hurried around the bed. Hit her shin twice. Managed to find him and grab his hands and she held tight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>That shut him up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you went through hell.\u201d Because that\u2019s exactly what it had been. While he\u2019d been walking in his father\u2019s blood, she\u2019d been rebelling at her normal life. Ah, damn. She must have seemed like such a fool to him. \u201cI wish things had been different for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWishing doesn\u2019t change the past.\u201d</p><p>No, nothing could change the past. \u201cBut your future can be different,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYour life doesn\u2019t have to just be blood and death. It can be more.\u201d</p><p>His glittering gaze seemed to bore into her. \u201cAnd what about you, Sarah? What do you want your life to be? You came looking for the death and the action and the monsters. Is that what you want your life to be like? Is it the thrill of the dark that gets to you?\u201d</p><p>The words were a dig at her, a swipe that hurt, but she didn\u2019t let him go. \u201cIt\u2019s not the dark I want. It was never that.\u201d Just to fit in.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to belong, sweet Sarah, with the wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Not just with the wolves. There were other packs. Other wolf shifters. Rafe hadn\u2019t been the first she\u2019d come across in her time at the Bureau. He\u2019d just the first wolf she\u2019d taken as a lover.</p><p>And if that hadn\u2019t been enough to scare a girl off shifters . . .</p><p>But no, she\u2019d gone right back in. Fallen hard for her legend.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to belong with you.\u201d The words came out quietly, and she knew there\u2019d be no more hiding. \u201cI knew you\u2019d keep me safe.\u201d The profile had been dead on. He protected those weaker, always looked out for them if they were his. Did he consider her part of his family? He\u2019d said she was in the pack, but . . . \u201cI think I was a little bit in love with you before I even met you.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cSarah . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big, bad LA wolf. The alpha who took on a den of vampires to get his brother back\u2014took them on and took them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did have a little help with that,\u201d he said, voice dark and rumbling.</p><p>The wolfpack rumors didn\u2019t care about his help. \u201cYou\u2019ve never killed humans. There\u2019s never even been so much as a whisper about you hurting them.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her, not saying a word, and she tensed. \u201cI\u2019m not as desperate as you seem to think, Lucas. It\u2019s not pack or nothing for me. Hell, it\u2019s not even pack. It\u2019s just . . .\u201d You.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he warned her. \u201cBe very, very careful.\u201d And his hands bit into her flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She\u2019d turned her back on the careful life years ago.</p><p>\u201cBecause if you push me too far, I won\u2019t ever let you go.\u201d</p><p>What if that was what she wanted? \u201cLucas . . .\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed over hers. A quick, hard press that had her wanting him back in the bed with her. His body against hers, in her.</p><p>But he lifted his head too quickly. \u201cDane\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cYou should dress.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d rather keep talking to him. Dammit, she\u2019d just said she was in love with the guy. She\u2019d never said words like that to a man before. \u201cWe\u2019re not done, wolf,\u201d she promised him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Soft. \u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>A knock shook the door. Sarah wrapped the sheet around her body, tighter this time. She didn\u2019t want it to slip and fall.</p><p>Lucas yanked on his pair of jeans and headed for the door. She caught his arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep pushing you.\u201d She could give warnings, too. She stood on her tiptoes and let her lips tease his savaged ear, then Sarah whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll push and push until I get just what I want.\u201d</p><p>His head turned. His eyes caught hers. \u201cAnd what is it that you really want?\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t he see? \u201cYou. Just you, Lucas.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stepped away from him. He\u2019d believe her or he wouldn\u2019t. This wasn\u2019t about protection or the FBI or Rafe or any damn other thing. It was just about them. \u201cAnd I need you to just want me, too.\u201d Not the charmer. Not the woman he could use to spy on enemies or to make sure that his pack was always loyal. \u201cJust want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Growled.</p><p>Her breath rushed out.</p> <p>He reached for the door and yanked it open just as a fist slammed into the wood again.</p><p>Dane blinked. Faint light spilled on him from the bulb outside. Jordan stood just behind him, his shoulders hunched against the night.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d Dane told Jordan, slowly lowering his fist. \u201cShe needed clothes.\u201d</p><p>He tossed a bag to Sarah. She caught it, and her sheet didn\u2019t slip.</p><p>\u201cI know my brother.\u201d Jordan\u2019s lips curved a bit. \u201cAnd I saw the way he looked at her.\u201d</p> <p>What? Did they think Lucas had ripped her clothes off? Oh, tempting, but no. \u201cThere was blood on my clothes, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And Dane came through the door with narrowed eyes and a tight jaw. \u201cI could smell it outside.\u201d He crossed to Sarah\u2019s side. \u201cHer blood.\u201d</p><p>Jordan kicked the door closed and flipped on the light. \u201cHere we go.\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed in Dane\u2019s jaw. \u201cIs Karen dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And why did it matter to him? He\u2019d been the one to gag the agent and stuff her into the back of a van.</p><p>Suspicion hit, hard, and she knew Lucas had the same thought because he grabbed Dane and tossed him back against the wall.</p> <p>\u201cHow well do you know the FBI agent, Dane?\u201d Lucas\u2019s arm was at the other shifter\u2019s throat.</p><p>Dane blinked. \u201cFBI? I thought\u2014I thought she was working with the coyotes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was,\u201d Sarah said, seeing the immediate relaxation of Lucas\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Dane had my back.</p><p>Always.</p><p>\u201cBut she was playing them,\u201d Lucas told him, dropping his arm and stepping back. \u201cShe was undercover.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s gaze tracked to Sarah. \u201cShe\u2019s like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s like Sarah.\u201d Lucas shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cNo one.\u201d</p> <p>That was sweet of her wolf to notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d Dane stepped away from the wall, his hands clenched. \u201cLucas, tell me you didn\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Lucas frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Sarah tightened her grip on the bag. \u201cHe may have saved her.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s head whipped toward her.</p><p>\u201cIt was the demon, Marley.\u201d Sarah wet her lips. Ah, how to be delicate?</p><p>\u201cTurns out she was an FBI plant, too.\u201d Lucas didn\u2019t bother with delicate. \u201cThey\u2019ve been watching the paranormals. Keeping tabs on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures,\u201d Jordan said, slumping against the wall but his sharp gaze belied the relaxed pose. \u201cBig brother does like to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd exterminate.\u201d Dane\u2019s eyes were still on Sarah.</p><p>\u201cOnly this time, the FBI agents are the ones being taken out.\u201d She should have been told about the connection between the victims sooner. Without that Intel, she\u2019d been working the case blind. But if Miller thought she was the one who\u2019d turned, dammit, yes, the bastard would have been trying to keep her out of the loop. She sighed. \u201cAccording to Karen, Rafe\u2019s been targeting undercover agents\u2014killing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Dane\u2019s stare tracked to Lucas. \u201cYou\u2019re not FBI. Why\u2019s he so hot for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pissed off the asshole because I killed his bastard of a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaber.\u201d A low whistle. \u201cThat piece of shit was Rafe\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sarah saw his sharpening canines.</p><p>Dane growled. \u201cRafe should probably thank you for taking him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>She could feel the rage in the room. Dark shadows had filled Dane\u2019s eyes. Sarah\u2019s toes curled into the thin carpet. \u201cDid you\u2014did you find Marley?\u201d</p><p>It was Jordan who answered. \u201cWe found the burned remains of some poor human in the woods.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cMarley didn\u2019t leave a lot for us to identify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it a man?\u201d Curtis.</p><p>Jordan nodded. \u201cNo weapon.\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d taken his gun. Sarah sucked in a deep breath. \u201cIt could have been the agent with Karen.\u201d Could have\u2014who was she fooling? The odds were sky high that Marley had killed the man, and Sarah had been so intent on getting Karen to safety, she hadn\u2019t even thought about him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice snapped like a whip.</p><p>Sarah swallowed and glanced at him.</p><p>\u201cHe left us. He ran into the woods. He knew the coyotes were there, he took us to that trap and left us.\u201d The faint lines around his eyes deepened. \u201cHis blood\u2019s not on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s on Marley.\u201d Dane shoved his hands into his pockets. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons it was so easy for us to track the bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Sarah tensed at Lucas\u2019s stark voice. So much fury.</p><p>\u201c208 Mythlin Street.\u201d Dane lifted a brow. \u201cSound familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we were looking for you\u2014when those vamps took you\u2014\u201d He shoved a finger toward Jordan. \u201cThat was where we found Marie. That\u2019s one of her safe houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jordan said, \u201cit was one of Marie\u2019s houses, but now Rafe and Marley are holed up inside, and I think it\u2019s past time we went in and hauled their asses out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>Okay, she needed to get out of the sheet. Sarah whirled around. \u201cI\u2019ll change and get my gun.\u201d The adrenaline already had her blood pumping faster. The nightmare was ending. If they could take out Rafe . . .</p><p>She shut the bathroom door and yanked on the clothes as fast as she could. Hiding out at Marie\u2019s\u2014Rafe probably thought that was brilliant.</p><p>Sarah grabbed the knob and pulled the door open. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas was gone. Dane was gone. Jordan still slumped against the wall. One dark brow climbed when he saw her and he shook his head slowly. \u201cAh, Sarah, did you really think he\u2019d risk you?\u201d</p><p>Her heart lurched. \u201cHe left me?\u201d But she\u2019d only been in the bathroom for a few moments and she hadn\u2019t even heard the creak of the door.</p><p>\u201cLike I said . . . I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at you.\u201d Jordan shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to put your life on the line.\u201d</p><p>Damn him. \u201cHe needs help.\u201d</p><p>She caught the slight tightening of Jordan\u2019s lips. \u201cHe has Dane. And Dane\u2019s already arranged for Piers to meet \u2019em there. Those guys are his backup. Always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you? What are you, Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a good question.\u201d He smiled, but it was grim.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as strong as they are. I\u2019m not\u2014yes, I get that.\u201d Lucas needed more back up. No telling how many of his wolf pack Rafe had brought in. And then there was Marley. \u201cHe can\u2019t do this with just Dane and Piers backing him.\u201d She grabbed the gun from the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cHe and Dane have experience taking down rogue wolves. I know, I saw the blood firsthand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Kaber didn\u2019t know Lucas was coming back for him and that jerk also didn\u2019t have a fire-throwing demon on his side.\u201d Not good odds. \u201cRafe will have that house protected. He\u2019s going to do anything and everything he can\u2014he wants Lucas dead.\u201d</p><p>Jordan caught her shoulders when she tried to go for the door. \u201cYou may as well be just human. If you go, you\u2019ll just slow him down.\u201d</p><p>Did everyone have to throw up the human comment to her? \u201cHumans aren\u2019t as weak as you think.\u201d They all made that mistake. \u201cIf Rafe\u2019s men shift . . .\u201d Now she smiled and she knew the grin was as grim as his had been. \u201cThey\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>His golden gaze searched hers. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t shift? If they attack with claws but still with the bodies of men? What the hell then? You\u2019ll distract my brother. If anything happens to you . . .\u201d His claws were out. \u201cI\u2019m not going to watch him go over the edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I.\u201d She raised the gun. \u201cIt\u2019s loaded with silver bullets, and I took backup ammo from the van. If Rafe\u2019s men don\u2019t shift, then I can still take them out.\u201d Wasting time. \u201cI\u2019m a good shot, better than good, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know you are, lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are we just standing here?\u201d Now she was the one nearly growling. He\u2019d left me. \u201cLucas needs us.\u201d</p><p>The struggle was clear on his face. \u201cHe told me to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Fine. \u201cThen stay by my side. Stay with me every step of the way, but come on!\u201d Her gut was twisting, her knees shaking, and she knew that this battle wasn\u2019t going to end easily. Rafe wasn\u2019t this sloppy. He wouldn\u2019t have let the other wolves track him\u2014or even track his demon\u2014unless he\u2019d wanted to be found.</p><p>Because he had a backup plan already in place. Yes, she knew him well. Better than Lucas did. And if Lucas had just stayed and given her the chance to explain . . .</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t leave my sight,\u201d Jordan snapped. \u201cYou stay within a foot of me at all times.\u201d</p><p>Sarah jerked her head in agreement and ripped open the door. \u201cJust don\u2019t get between my gun and a target.\u201d Weak. Not hardly. It was time to show the wolves how strong their prey could really be.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Jordan agreed, \u201cbut you can\u2019t get between my claws and the assholes I\u2019m planning to rip apart.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>Hold on, Lucas. Because from now on, he wouldn\u2019t be leaving her behind. In the wolf pack, mates hunted together.</p><p>Time for the man to realize he was mated.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>The house at 208 Mythlin hadn\u2019t changed much. The sprawling two-story brick house still hid behind the twisting trees at the end of the long, pothole-filled road. The wraparound porch showed no signs of neglect. Unlike the other dumps on the street, this house was perfect . . . because it was hers.</p><p>The first time he\u2019d been there, he\u2019d been tracking Maya Black. He\u2019d been so desperate to find his brother, he hadn\u2019t cared that he\u2019d courted the mambo\u2019s wrath by bringing blood and death right to her door. No, he hadn\u2019t cared, not until later.</p><p>Then he\u2019d had to bleed for the mambo. Blood for blood. But he\u2019d set his debt to rights.</p><p>\u201cIt sure is quiet,\u201d came Piers\u2019s whisper. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching the place for the last twenty minutes . . . not a peep.\u201d</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t smell a thing. Literally, not a damn thing. No wolf scent. No telltale ash. Not even sweat. \u201cI thought you followed Marley\u2019s scent here.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s eyes were on the house. \u201cI did, but it\u2019s\u2014hell, it\u2019s different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic?\u201d Piers barely breathed the word.</p><p>At Marie\u2019s? Hell, yeah, magic was a definite possibility. \u201cTime to shift.\u201d Because he wasn\u2019t gonna waste those precious moments later. Better to shift now, go in strong and take the bastards out. He knew Rafe likely had his coyote dogs and some wolves around. Lucas was ready for the blood and battle. This war was ending tonight.</p><p>\u201cWe should be able to smell \u2019em,\u201d Piers growled and his bones began to snap. \u201cShould still be able to . . .\u201d Fur covered his flesh.</p><p>He was right. Lucas stared at the windows of Marie\u2019s house. He could see light flickering. Bright light.</p><p>No, not just light. Fire.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t smell the smoke. What the fuck? \u201cBe ready for anything,\u201d he ordered, and the burn of the shift swept through him. His bones broke, stretched, his hands vanished and his claws dug into the dirt.</p><p>Rafael, I\u2019m coming for you, asshole.</p><p>Then he heard it. The faintest sound of laughter drifting in the air.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you showed up, Simone!\u201d Rafe shouted from the recesses of the house. \u201cI was getting bored waiting on you . . . so I had to go ahead and start my party.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Then a woman screamed, loud, long, full of pain and fear. Marley? It figured that Rafe would turn on her. He seemed to turn on everyone.</p><p>\u201cAnd before you go guessing . . .\u201d Came that damn, mocking voice. \u201cMarley\u2019s not the one screaming.\u201d The laughter filled the night again. \u201cCome and see what I\u2019ve got in here!\u201d</p><p>Not what. Who.</p><p>Lucas glanced to the left, then the right. Dane and Piers had shifted, and their eyes were on him. He threw back his head and howled. Forget going in softly. Rafe knew he was there. So Lucas would go in fast\u2014</p><p>His legs pumped as he flew over the earth.</p><p>\u2014and he\u2019d go in hard\u2014</p><p>He dove right through the window, barely feeling the glass slice into his pelt.</p><p>\u2014and he\u2019d take that bastard out.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s motorcycle braked and Sarah jumped off the bike\u2014just in time to see a big, black wolf hurtle through a pane of glass.</p><p>Lucas.</p><p>A slightly smaller black wolf and a white wolf dove after him.</p><p>\u201cSmoke.\u201d Jordan climbed off after her. \u201cThat demon\u2019s burning again!\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s gun was already out and in her hands. She and Jordan ran together, rushing for the house.</p><p>They\u2019d taken about ten steps when the first two coyotes appeared. The coyotes stalked from the bushes, their heads low to the ground, their ears up, and damn if it didn\u2019t look like they were smiling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDammit, I could have used a heads-up here!\u201d Sarah said, her shoulders bumping into Jordan\u2019s.

Only the fire.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. Not good.</p><p>Two more coyotes jumped from the darkness. Saliva dripped from their sharp teeth.</p><p>Sarah braced her legs. \u201cI think now might be a good time for you to think about shifting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But from the corner of her eye, she saw his claws burst from his fingertips. \u201cIf I try a full shift, I\u2019ll be dead before the wolf comes out.\u201d</p> <p>Right. Because the coyotes liked to attack when prey was weak. \u201cThen I guess it\u2019s my turn.\u201d Sarah took a deep breath.</p><p>The coyotes attacked.</p><p>Blood dripped from Josette Dusean\u2019s throat. A long, steady line of blood that trickled down her neck.</p><p>Lucas froze when he saw her. She shouldn\u2019t have been there. She should have been with Maya. The vamp and her dragon were supposed to be protecting Josette.</p><p>Piers snarled behind him and leapt forward, racing right toward the woman who was tied to a chair and slowly dying in front of them.</p><p>Bait? A trap?</p> <p>Lucas\u2019s gaze scanned the room. He couldn\u2019t smell anything but the fire. Couldn\u2019t even catch the scent of Josette\u2019s blood.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>Fuck. A growl built in his throat. Piers, no! He snapped out the order in his mind. Get away from her!</p><p>Piers stopped, his claws digging into the hardwood. Look at her. She fucking needs help!</p><p>Appearances could be deceiving.</p><p>Dane edged around the room. Sniffing. Or rather, trying to sniff.</p><p>Lucas advanced on Josette. He could feel the heat from the fire burning in the next room. Josette\u2019s eyes were open, glistening with tears, staring right at him.</p><p>Go search in the other room. The room that smelled of smoke and hell. Go, Piers! Go!</p> <p>But Piers didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Go! He shoved the command at him once more, but Piers had his entire focus on Josette.</p><p>She needs me. Piers advanced toward her. I won\u2019t leave her to die.</p><p>Fuck. He\u2019d suspected this, feared it. Damn well not the time. Dane\u2014get in the other room!</p><p>Dane raced forward and drove his body into the door. The wood smashed and smoke seeped through that hole.</p><p>A faint, weak smile curved Josette\u2019s lips and her hands were pulling at the ropes. Only those ropes didn\u2019t look that tight.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI came . . . I came to kill him . . . to avenge my grandmother, but he caught me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fuck the lying bitch.</p><p>Lucas lunged forward, his front legs kicking the other wolf out of the way. She screamed, a high, desperate scream that was Piers\u2019s name.</p><p>Smart. Damn smart.</p><p>No, Lucas! The desperate roar in his mind came from Piers. Don\u2019t hurt her! I think she\u2019s my mate!</p><p>The tip of a knife scraped Lucas\u2019s side. He stopped wasting time. Lucas attacked. His teeth went for her throat even as a gunshot echoed in his ears.</p><p>Then claws sank into his back. Get away from her! Piers bit him, digging his teeth into Lucas\u2019s flesh.</p><p>Snarling, Lucas twisted and shoved back against the other wolf. What the fuck?</p><p>She\u2019s. Mine.</p><p>Josette wasn\u2019t screaming anymore. Piers blocked her body with his, and the white wolf\u2019s eyes blazed with fury. Mine.</p><p>It really was one hell of a time for Piers to think he\u2019d found a mate. The rich flavor of blood lingered on Lucas\u2019s tongue. He stared at the other wolf, sides heaving.</p><p>Mine. Piers snarled again.</p><p>No, she\u2019s not.</p><p>Because that wasn\u2019t Josette Dusean. The smells might be off thanks to magic or drugs or who-the-hell-knew-what, but Lucas was certain of one thing.</p><p>Demon blood always tasted the same. Bitter to the last drop. Stay away from her!</p><p>More gunshots blasted.</p><p>Then \u201cJosette\u201d lunged out of the chair, the knife he\u2019d felt before still gripped in her hand\u2014</p><p>Piers! He screamed the psychic warning.</p><p>\u2014and she sank it hilt-deep in Piers\u2019s back.</p><p>Fire crackled, greedily eating its way up the walls of the interior room. The red and gold flames twisted and heaved, and in the middle of the hell, Dane saw a woman lying on the ground.</p><p>A woman with long black hair. Perfect coffee skin.</p><p>He jumped over the fire, feeling the heat lance his fur. He went in carefully, ready for an attack.</p><p>But the woman didn\u2019t move.</p><p>He tried to catch her scent but the smoke seemed to burn the inside of his nose. Can\u2019t smell a thing.</p><p>His muzzle pressed against her back. She coughed then, her body heaving, and he saw her face.</p><p>Josette Dusean.</p><p>The same face that had stared at him in the other room.</p><p>Demons could really piss him off. Dane growled.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>But the fire seemed to tighten around him. Those flames were definitely higher now. Higher, fiercer, stronger. Like a net of fire that was closing in. Fucking magic.</p><p>Sonofabitch. He was an idiot. They\u2019d raced right into the bastard\u2019s trap. But then, Rafe had used very, very good bait.</p><p>Piers howled in agony and twisted, but he didn\u2019t hit his attacker with his claws.</p><p>Of course not. Piers thought the woman was his mate. Lucas\u2019s muscles bunched as he prepared to leap.</p><p>She laughed, yanked the knife out and plunged it in again.</p><p>Hell, no.</p><p>Lucas flew at her. But instead of catching her flesh, he barreled into Piers. Piers lifted his head and met Lucas\u2019s stare. The white wolf\u2019s eyes were filled with pain and fury and fear.</p><p>Back away. Lucas didn\u2019t want to hurt him. That\u2019s not Josette.</p><p>Piers just snarled at him.</p><p>And then the bastard came out of hiding. Rafe sauntered into the room as if he didn\u2019t have a fucking care in the world.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s past caring, or maybe even hearing what you say.\u201d Rafe smirked at Lucas. \u201cAnd your boy Dane . . . well . . . the fur\u2019s about to burn right off his body. You won\u2019t be getting help from him.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lunged for the asshole.</p><p>But Piers caught him, held him tight with claws and teeth.</p><p>\u201cEverybody always said Piers was close to the edge,\u201d Rafe\u2019s smirk turned into a cruel grin. \u201cGood thing they were right, or otherwise, you both might be at my throat right now.\u201d</p><p>I will get your throat.</p><p>Rafe lifted his hand and pointed at the woman. \u201cThis time, use the knife on Simone.\u201d</p><p>The bitch came at him, bloody and strong.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t stab him. Lucas didn\u2019t give her the chance. One swipe of his claws and he ripped open her throat.</p><p>The roar of fury that filled his mind told him that Piers had gone over the edge.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t coming back.</p><p>\u201cBad move, Simone. Very, very bad . . .\u201d Yet Rafe sounded so pleased. \u201cOf course, I was hoping to kill you myself, but getting killed by your own packmate\u2014ah, fitting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Lucas twisted and barely managed to keep Piers\u2019s teeth from biting into his throat. Piers didn\u2019t even seem to notice that Josette\u2019s image had changed in death. Her skin had lightened, her hair shortened, her face\u2014not Josette anymore.</p><p>Marley.</p><p>A demon\u2019s glamour spell ended in death, and the illusion was totally gone now.</p><p>If only Piers would fucking look!</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you learned anything since I\u2019ve been in town?\u201d Rafe\u2019s mocking drawl was really pissing him off. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust your pack. You thought they had your back, didn\u2019t you? Now, well, they\u2019re after you. First Caleb. Now Piers.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hurt you, Piers. Listen to me, dammit. That wasn\u2019t your mate. Look at her!</p><p>But Piers was only looking at him and the rage in the other wolf\u2019s eyes seared his skin.</p><p>Josette. He should have connected the dots sooner. Shit, Piers had even told him that he\u2019d been watching her. How long had the guy known she was his? And why the hell hadn\u2019t he tried to claim her? Piers had danced near the edge too long, he should have gone after Josette with everything he had.</p><p>Like Lucas would have gone after Sarah.</p><p>Piers swiped at him, but Lucas slammed his head into the wolf\u2019s side. I don\u2019t want to hurt you. He blasted out the thought again. His teeth snapped together. But I will. He couldn\u2019t get past the red wall of rage in the other wolf\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cCaleb turned on you.\u201d Rafe\u2019s voice droned on. \u201cSure, it took some poison and the promise of an excruciating death, but I got him to lie and lead you right into my trap.\u201d</p><p>A trap that hadn\u2019t fucking worked.</p><p>\u201cHe should have killed you.\u201d Now Rafe didn\u2019t seem quite so pleased. \u201cCaleb had the chance to attack, but . . .\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d pulled back.</p><p>Piers tore into Lucas\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThis one won\u2019t pull back.\u201d Ah, now Rafe was happy again.</p><p>Sorry, Piers. Lucas leapt up and shoved his claws into the knife wounds on Piers\u2019s back. When the wolf howled in agony, Lucas lunged off his body and dove right for Rafe.</p><p>Rafe didn\u2019t back up. He didn\u2019t try to shift. He just stood there and Lucas crashed into him. They slammed into the floor, and he went for Rafe\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cSomething you should know . . .\u201d Rafe murmured. He wasn\u2019t even fighting. \u201cSarah\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Lying bastard.</p><p>His teeth dug into Rafe\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cOr else, she will be, if you don\u2019t get the fuck off me.\u201d Lucas froze, the taste of the bastard\u2019s blood on his tongue, then Rafe said, \u201cMy men have her surrounded outside. Her gun\u2014the one you probably heard firing a moment ago\u2014is out of bullets, and as for your little brother . . . well, let\u2019s just say he\u2019s not quite the scrapper that you are.\u201d</p><p>Shit, shit, shit . . . Sarah!</p><p>She should have been back at the hotel. Safe. Rafe could be lying, but . . .</p><p>The gunshots.</p><p>\u201cGet off, wolf . . . or you can rip my throat out, like you did to Marley, and then you can go and mourn over your dead lover.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lifted his head.</p><p>\u201cThought so,\u201d Rafe said as Lucas raced back to that broken window. He hurtled past the jagged glass and his paws slammed into the ground. He ran, fast, fast\u2014desperate to get to her side.</p><p>He heard the clicks just as he burst onto the sidewalk. The clicks from Sarah\u2019s empty gun. Six dead coyotes littered the ground. Sarah and Jordan were standing, back to back. Sarah had her gun up and when she saw him, her eyes widened. \u201cLucas!\u201d</p><p>He realized too late that her shout was a warning. He tried to turn and glance back, but the bullet drove into him, and even as he fell, the form of the wolf began to melt away.</p><p>The fur melted from Dane\u2019s body and the heat singed his flesh. He didn\u2019t have a choice. He had to shift. The wolf could escape the fire, but if he did, the woman would die.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, the man could save them both. Besides, what was a little pain?</p><p>This what you meant, Marie? Do I have to get ready for the fucking pain again?</p><p>He hefted Josette into his arms. Her head lolled against his shoulder. \u201cBaby, this is the part where you\u2019re supposed to be holding on,\u201d he muttered. He took a breath. No clothes. No cover. The fire would burn right against his flesh.</p><p>Her eyelashes began to flutter.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see this.\u201d</p><p>Then leapt, dove through the fire, but the flames touched her skin and she screamed.</p><p>And screamed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop running. The fire ate at him, and he hunched his shoulders, trying to protect her as much as he could. The smoke filled his lungs, choking him, but he kept going and then he was before the door he\u2019d broken. Dane shoved his way past the splintered wood and into the other room.</p><p>He fell to the floor, rolling, twisting as he tried to put out the flames.</p><p>Josette wasn\u2019t screaming anymore. Her eyes were open, wide, and blank with shock.</p><p>He caught her chin. His hands were covered with blisters and rough, red flesh. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d The pain rolled through his body. Pain\u2014that teasing bitch. He knew her so well. He took the pain, pulled it in deep, and let it make him stronger.</p><p>A ragged groan reached his ears. He turned his head and saw Piers staring at him. The white wolf\u2019s pelt was matted with blood. Piers growled at him, advancing slowly.</p><p>Behind him, Dane saw what was left of Marley. Looked like Lucas had kept his word and taken her out.</p><p>So where was Rafe?</p><p>\u201cEase up, Piers. She\u2019ll be all right.\u201d He glanced back at Josette.</p><p>Piers growled again, and the low, menacing sound had Dane tensing.</p><p>Piers leapt toward him, but froze when thunder filled the night. No, not thunder. Gunfire.</p><p>The white wolf\u2019s head snapped toward the busted window. Seconds later, Piers raced into the night.</p><p>The fire slipped into the room then, and the crackles almost sounded like an old woman\u2019s laughter. Not again. Dane grabbed Josette, didn\u2019t even feel the tear of his skin as the burned flesh ripped, and followed that bloody wolf.</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d Sarah lunged forward, but Jordan grabbed her, hauling her right back to him.</p><p>Lucas was on the ground, his body contorting, and the wolf vanishing as his body automatically shifted in a bid to heal and live.</p><p>Her heart raced in her chest and then . . . then her knees gave way. If Jordan hadn\u2019t held her, Sarah would have fallen face-first onto the ground. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A strange cold wrapped around her body, a cold that numbed her legs and arms, even while her back burned\u2014burned and throbbed as if a bullet had lodged near her spine.</p><p>Not my spine. Lucas\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSarah? What the hell is happening?\u201d</p> <p>The gun slipped from her fingers and hit the ground. She opened her mouth, tried to explain to Jordan, but only a ragged moan of pain came from her lips.</p><p>\u201cBastard, you should have died the first time I pumped you full of silver,\u201d Rafe snarled and closed in on Lucas. \u201cFucking magic won\u2019t save you now. It can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He lives . . . you live.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes squeezed shut as the fire from her back fought that numbing cold in her limbs.</p><p>He dies . . . Marie\u2019s voice whispered through her mind. Then you die.</p> <p>Her eyes flew open. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Lucas was on the ground, on his hands and knees, trying to push up as the blood poured from his back. Behind him, Rafe had a gun up, aimed, ready to blow that silver bullet into him again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Sarah screamed, pushing through the pain and breaking away from Jordan. \u201cDamn you, Rafe, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>But his fingers squeezed the trigger.</p><p>Sarah saw the flash of white behind him. Piers. Running fast. Snarling. Piers!</p><p>A red haze of fury rolled back at her.</p> <p>She\u2019d promised. Said she wouldn\u2019t control\u2014</p><p>The hell with that. Lucas\u2019s life was on the line. She\u2019d do anything for him.</p><p>\u201cI win, Simone,\u201d Rafe said, lips raised in a half-grin \u201cI win. I\u2019m the legend now.\u201d</p><p>Attack, Piers! Take Rafe down!</p><p>Piers slammed into Rafe. They fell in a tangle of fur and arms. The gun discharged, but the bullet didn\u2019t hit Lucas.</p><p>Sarah started to breathe again.</p><p>Then she realized the bullet had struck Piers. The white wolf slumped to the side. His fur began to vanish.</p><p>Growls filled the air now. The wolf shifters in Rafe\u2019s pack. They\u2019d been lurking in the shadows but now they sprang forward. Still in the form of men, but with claws out and teeth sharp.</p> <p>Jordan pushed her behind him and when the first man attacked, he sliced the guy from neck to groin.</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d she whispered. He was on his feet now. His wild eyes focused on her.</p><p>\u201cYou should be dead!\u201d Rafe shoved away from Piers. \u201cYou should be fucking dead!\u201d He had his gun pointed at Lucas again.</p><p>Lucas turned toward him.</p><p>Rafe fired. Once. Twice.</p><p>The bullets drove into Lucas\u2019s chest.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stumble. Sarah did. She slipped and fell down behind Jordan. He kept fighting. Slicing and clawing and her chest burned. She touched the skin, expecting to see blood. She felt as if she\u2019d been ripped open.</p><p>Not me. Lucas.</p><p>What had Marie done?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not killing me . . .\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice rumbled in the night. \u201cBut I am taking you . . . to hell, asshole.\u201d She pushed to her knees. Tried to see\u2014</p><p>Rafe fired again. The gun clicked then, the chamber jamming. Yes. Lucas swiped with his claws and cut Rafe\u2019s wrist open. The gun fell from his slack fingers.</p><p>Rafe\u2019s eyes flew to her. He saw her on the ground, struggling to rise, and he smiled. \u201cShift!\u201d He roared the order to his men. \u201cThe bitch is weak. She can\u2019t do anything but die!\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s head whipped toward her. \u201cSarah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShift!\u201d Rafe screamed. \u201cAnd we kill \u2019em all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew the shift.\u201d Lucas\u2019s claws drove into Rafe\u2019s chest. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking dying . . . now.\u201d</p><p>But it was too late. The men were already shifting around her. Curses turned to snarls and growls and Jordan fought, taking out three men while they were vulnerable during the change. But it wasn\u2019t enough. Not nearly enough. The wolves closed in on Sarah and Jordan.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>The bitch is weak. Rafe\u2019s taunt echoed in her ears. Sarah rose slowly, the fire in her chest and back pulsing and sending waves of nausea through her body.</p><p>Not my pain. Not my wound. Though it sure felt like it was.</p><p>Jordan slashed with his claws, fighting, struggling for all he was worth. Determined to protect her.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s focus narrowed. She stared at the snapping wolves and a slow smile curved her lips. \u201cGuess what, assholes?\u201d She sucked in a deep breath and tasted blood. \u201cI\u2019m not weak.\u201d</p><p>Rafe was still alive. Still fighting with Lucas. Swiping with his claws even as Lucas carved a hole in the bastard\u2019s chest. Some people just weren\u2019t easy to kill.</p><p>Some were.</p><p>Attack Rafe. She ordered his wolves. Kill.</p><p>The wolves around her froze.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re doing that,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She fought to inhale another deep breath. She was in so much pain she could barely stand on her feet. But she didn\u2019t need physical strength. The Other should start understanding that it wasn\u2019t always about physical power.</p><p>Attack Rafe.</p><p>The wolves spun away and charged at Lucas and Rafe.</p><p>Lucas looked up. She saw his eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cBack the hell away, Lucas!\u201d Jordan shouted.</p><p>Lucas yanked his claws out of Rafe\u2019s chest. Rafe staggered. Blood dripped from his mouth.</p><p>The bastard fell.</p><p>The wolves swarmed him, attacking their leader at her command.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes closed. Kill him . . . then get the hell out of here. Never come back.</p><p>Yelps and whimpers had her eyes opening. Looked like the wolves weren\u2019t going to get the chance to run. Lucas was slicing, clawing them, and Dane was at his side. Taking the wolves out. The ones who weren\u2019t already dead turned tail and ran as fast as they could.</p><p>Over. Finally, it was over.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s shoulders sagged and the last of her energy slipped away. Jordan ran forward, chasing after the fleeing wolves and she fell, her side slamming into the ground. Lucas.</p><p>She was so cold. Her body was shaking and her throat\u2014it seemed like she was drowning. She couldn\u2019t suck in enough air. Couldn\u2019t . . .</p><p>Sarah saw Lucas fall. He went down, his knees crashing into the earth. Blood soaked his chest. The burning glow in his eyes began to fade.</p><p>Rafe had used silver bullets on him. Had they exploded on impact like the others? Three shots.</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d She saw his lips move as he whispered her name, and she wanted to go to him. To touch him. To hold him once more.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t move. Rafe was dead, the coyotes were dead, the rival wolves were running\u2014the nightmare was over.</p><p>And she was scared. Because Sarah knew that she couldn\u2019t fight anymore. Lucas couldn\u2019t fight. Her heartbeat was slowing, and even though she didn\u2019t have an injury on her body, she knew she was dying.</p><p>He lives . . . you live.</p><p>She could taste blood on her tongue and see the precious liquid drip past Lucas\u2019s lips.</p><p>He dies . . .</p><p>Her hand lifted toward him. Just one more touch.</p><p>He stretched out his hands, trying to crawl to her side. But Lucas was too far away.</p><p>Her legs weren\u2019t working. That meant his weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLucas?\u201d Jordan grabbed him, hauling him up, and swearing when he saw the full damage to his brother\u2019s body. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. You\u2019re going to be fine!\u201d</p><p>Such a liar.</p><p>The fire in her chest wasn\u2019t as strong anymore. Sarah kept her eyes on Lucas. She wouldn\u2019t look away from him. If she was dying, he\u2019d be the last thing she saw in this world.</p><p>\u201cNow you understand.\u201d</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t look away at the woman\u2019s soft voice. She couldn\u2019t look away. She\u2019d never seen Lucas\u2019s eyes so pale before. They\u2019d always blazed with life and power. Jordan was trying to stop the blood now, screaming at his brother to \u201cShift!\u201d But Lucas wasn\u2019t changing.</p><p>Sarah swallowed twice and finally managed to speak. \u201cI understood . . .\u201d she whispered, \u201cLong before now . . . Jo-Josette . . .\u201d</p><p>The woman bent toward her and cool fingers slid over Sarah\u2019s cheeks. \u201cWas the extra time worth the pain you have? Just a few days, that\u2019s all you got . . . and now you share his agony and soon, his death.\u201d</p><p>Was it worth it? \u201cI\u2019d do . . . anything.\u201d Everything. The trade was fair.</p><p>Josette leaned in close. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done everything,\u201d she whispered, her breath light at Sarah\u2019s ear. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t. Just . . . sad. There was so much she\u2019d hoped to do. Wanted to do. All with Lucas. \u201cDoes he . . . have to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong question.\u201d A slight wind rustled Sarah\u2019s hair. Josette murmured, \u201cYou should ask, \u2018Do I have to die?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes . . .\u201d So hard to talk now. She licked her lips and tasted more blood. Lucas still hadn\u2019t shifted. Shift. \u201cOthers are worth . . . more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas is worth more to you than your own life?\u201d</p><p>Shift. If he\u2019d just shift, he might survive.</p><p>\u201cSarah King . . .\u201d Josette\u2019s hand brushed back her hair. \u201cDo you even know when you gave your heart to the wolf?\u201d</p><p>Did it matter when? He had it, just as he had her. Mate. Beyond life. Beyond death.</p><p>If only she could touch him one more time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine! Lucas, are you hearing me? You\u2019re going to be fine!\u201d Jordan yelled at him.</p><p>His brother had flipped him over and now Jordan\u2019s hands were shoving at his chest, quickly becoming soaked in Lucas\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jordan snapped out. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. His chest was on fire, burning from the inside out. Damn silver bullets. Blood was rising in his throat, trying to choke him, and the air around him seemed colder. So cold. He wanted to close his eyes and let the pain sweep over him, but...</p><p>Sarah.</p><p>What was wrong with her? Her face had been too white. Her eyes not the dark green he knew. Instead, lighter, strained. Weak. And she\u2019d fallen to the ground. Her hand had reached for his, and she\u2019d fallen.</p><p>Lucas swallowed. Choked, but gasped, \u201cSarah . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay, man. I swear, I didn\u2019t let them so much as touch her.\u201d Clawmarks littered his brother\u2019s chest and arms. \u201cWe had to come. Sarah said it was a trap, that Rafe would be ready for you and that he\u2019d have his wolves waiting.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been right. But . . . if she wasn\u2019t hurt, then why was she on the ground? And why was fear twisting his insides, even as that pain blasted him? Not fear for himself.</p><p>For her.</p><p>\u201cShift.\u201d Jordan glared down at him. \u201cYou have to shift, and you have to shift now.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even feel the wolf inside. The transformation back to man had been too brutal, fueled by pain and the silver burning his body.</p><p>\u201cSarah . . .\u201d She was his focus. Maybe if he could get to her . . .</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>His head turned slowly to the right and he saw Dane. The guy\u2019s body was covered in blisters and angry red burns.</p><p>\u201cSarah\u2019s not dying!\u201d Jordan immediately yelled. \u201cFuck, Dane, why the hell would you say that now? She\u2019s fine, Lucas. Fine. Just shift and everything will be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fine? No.</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand what happened, do you?\u201d Dane asked, and his eyes narrowed on Lucas\u2019s face. \u201cI thought you understood magic better than this.\u201d</p><p>Jordan swore. \u201cDammit Dane, you\u2019re not helping\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time Rafe shot you full of silver, you were dead. No, you should have been dead, but your Sarah made a trade for you.\u201d</p><p>No trades would be made tonight. No more magic. Just death.</p><p>\u201cMarie said she bound your souls . . .\u201d</p><p>A tremor shook Lucas\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cAnd the minute I saw Sarah sprawled on top of you, hell, I knew she wasn\u2019t just yanking our chains. She did it, Lucas. Marie kept you alive, but the price for that life was a bonding with Sarah. Man and wolf. Hell, if she hadn\u2019t been a wolf charmer, I don\u2019t even know if it would have worked . . .\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s hand gabbed Lucas\u2019s chin. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this. Shift.\u201d</p><p>But Dane kept talking. \u201cYou\u2019re linked, Alpha. You lived before because Sarah lived. Her soul pulled you back. That was the only free ride you two got. From now on, if you live, she keeps living.\u201d</p><p>No, no. Because he knew what was coming. Knew\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd if you die, then she dies too.\u201d</p><p>He wrenched his head and managed to look at Sarah. His damn legs weren\u2019t working or he would have gone to her. He\u2019d already tried to crawl once. Must get ...</p><p>\u201cSo listen to your brother,\u201d Dane snarled. \u201cYou want to live, you want her to live, then you fucking find the strength to shift. There\u2019s no mambo to bring you back tonight.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that had been part of Rafe\u2019s master plan all along. He\u2019d taken out the mambo so magic couldn\u2019t aid Lucas. Dominos, all falling down . . .</p><p>\u201cSo you save yourself and you save your mate,\u201d Dane ordered. \u201cBecause otherwise, she\u2019s dying for you.\u201d</p><p>Sarah wasn\u2019t supposed to die. Sarah wasn\u2019t supposed to hurt. Sarah was supposed to be safe, happy. Free.</p><p>Fuck, no!</p><p>His claws dug into the earth and he fought to pull the wolf back, to raise him through the fire and agony that burned his body.</p><p>Sarah wasn\u2019t dying. He wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you.\u201d Josette\u2019s hand fell away from Sarah. \u201cI wish I could, but I\u2019m not . . . strong enough.\u201d Tears thickened her voice. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . .\u201d Was that really her talking? The voice was so weak, so broken. \u201cJust . . . get me to h-him . . .\u201d Could Josette even understand her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Touching Lucas once more was all that mattered. Her entire focus had centered on him. She needed him. And she wasn\u2019t dying without telling him the truth.</p><p>Because she\u2019d been lying to her wolf. She wouldn\u2019t die with that lie and she wouldn\u2019t let him die without knowing the truth.</p><p>Josette lifted Sarah\u2019s arm. Sarah didn\u2019t wince. Didn\u2019t gasp. She just took the wave of pain that came when Josette pulled her up. Josette eased her shoulders under Sarah\u2019s arm and the other woman wrapped her hands around Sarah\u2019s stomach. \u201cEasy . . .\u201d Josette whispered. \u201cGo slow.\u201d</p> <p>When you didn\u2019t have a lot of time, slow wasn\u2019t really an option.</p><p>A chorus of high-pitched howls split the night. She heard the fear in those howls.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s head lifted and she saw an explosion of fire light the night. Fire that had come from behind the line of trees to the right. Rafe\u2019s wolves had fled that way, disappearing into the trees. But it looked like those bastards might not have gotten away after all.</p><p>A woman walked from the woods. Her dark hair brushed past her shoulders. Her steps were sure, certain, and her fingers curled around a gun. The full moon also revealed that her nails had sharpened into claws and her teeth\u2014vampire.</p><p>\u201cMaya!\u201d Josette yelled. \u201cHelp me, please!\u201d</p> <p>Maya\u2019s eyes widened and then she raced forward. \u201cJosie, dammit! Why the hell did you run from me? I lost your scent\u2014it just disappeared and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dying,\u201d Josette said, her soft voice cutting through the fury of Maya\u2019s.</p><p>The vampire kept running toward them. The scent of fire came with her. \u201cI don\u2019t see any blood on her.\u201d Maya took her away from Josette. Sarah\u2019s hand slipped into her back pocket, searching . . . there. Her fingers curled around the treasure and she whispered, \u201cLucas . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one with the blood,\u201d Josette said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that I can smell. The blood and the silver. Not anything else, though, why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas . . .\u201d Sarah dug her nails into the vampire\u2019s arm.</p> <p>\u201cOuch! Shit, okay, you want him, you got him.\u201d Maya scooped her up, even though the vamp was smaller than her\u2014gotta love that enhanced vampire strength\u2014and carried her to Lucas. He was on the ground, body twisting, his bones snapping, but he wasn\u2019t shifting. Just . . . trapped. In pain.</p><p>Maya eased her onto the ground. \u201cSomeone tell me what the hell is happening here. Ah, Rafael\u2019s dead, that\u2019s good. Guess Lucas beat me this time . . .\u201d</p><p>Sarah ignored her and reached for Lucas\u2019s hand. His fingers curled around hers.</p><p>\u201cWhen he killed grand-m\u00e8re, Rafe stole a brew of hell-fire from her,\u201d Josette said. \u201cIt burns, fills the air, and the scent covers nearly everything else.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s hand was cold. No, she was cold. Sarah wet her lips. He was close. Everything should be better now. \u201cNeed to tell . . .\u201d</p><p>The others fell silent. They didn\u2019t matter then anyway. Only he mattered.</p><p>His claws were out, but he still had the body of a man. Still had those too light blue eyes.</p><p>Her fingers squeezed his. \u201cI . . . lied.\u201d But what else was new, right?</p> <p>If he were in wolf form, she could think all this instead of struggling to speak. But then, if he were in wolf form, he might have a fighting chance.</p><p>\u201cDo something, Josette.\u201d Dane growled. \u201cDammit, your grandmother was the mambo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a dead-raiser. I can\u2019t do anything unless he\u2014\u201d She muffled a sob. \u201cYou don\u2019t want my help. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Sarah kept her eyes on Lucas. \u201cI made . . . deal . . . with FBI . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t speak. Maybe he couldn\u2019t. His mouth was blood-red. No, that was blood dripping from his lips.</p><p>\u201cMiller . . . w-wanted me to take out Rafe . . .\u201d He\u2019d stopped her outside of LA. Given her orders, even though she didn\u2019t even work for the jerk anymore.</p><p>Sarah realized her heart wasn\u2019t beating just right. Far too slow.</p><p>\u201cIf . . . if I . . . d-did . . . you\u2019d be o-ff . . .\u201d Off the extermination list. His pack would be clear. They wouldn\u2019t be watched. Wouldn\u2019t be targeted for death. But she couldn\u2019t say any of that. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>A growl built in Lucas\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cShift!\u201d Dane snarled.</p><p>But he had too much silver in him. She knew it.</p><p>\u201cGet the silver out!\u201d Maya shouted. \u201cCut him open and get it out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shattered,\u201d Josette said. \u201cExploded on impact. Rafe said it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dying!\u201d The furious determination was Jordan\u2019s. His claws sliced into Lucas\u2019s chest.</p><p>Sarah felt the rip of her own flesh.</p><p>Tell him.</p><p>\u201cM-mate . . .\u201d He was hers. She\u2019d known it the first time he kissed her. More than a legend. The man who\u2019d offered her protection. Passion. Life. And . . . \u201cLove.\u201d Her chest rattled. \u201cLove . . . Lucas.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t die without telling him.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t die without knowing.</p><p>For him, she\u2019d trade anything, do anything.</p><p>And it sure looked like she\u2019d be dying for him.</p><p>\u201cLove . . .\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered. Her heart lurched. Lucas\u2019s fingers opened and Marie\u2019s ring, the ring Sarah had kept close, lay nestled between their hands.</p><p>Josette gasped. \u201cGrand-m\u00e8re . . .\u201d</p><p>Not ready to give your life for his, are you?</p><p>Marie\u2019s voice. The mambo had asked her that and Sarah had been afraid. She wasn\u2019t afraid anymore. \u201cI . . . will . . .\u201d</p><p>The ring began to slip from their hands.</p><p>Josette dove for them. Her fingers wrapped around theirs, and she held tight. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Thunder rumbled. A whisper of a thousand voices filled the air. Hands reached for Sarah, cold, greedy hands.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Josette tightened her hold and heat, fiery heat, exploded in Sarah\u2019s palm. \u201cDeath, you can piss off!\u201d Josette screamed. \u201cI\u2019m taking my grand-m\u00e8re\u2019s power!\u201d</p><p>Then an electric current ripped through Sarah\u2019s body. She jerked, heaved, and saw Lucas do the same. But Josette took the hardest hit. She cried out, and her body flew back through the air. Sarah saw her slam into the ground and crumple near Piers.</p><p>Then she didn\u2019t see anything else but darkness.</p><p>Love . . .</p><p>If you were gonna die, Sarah figured there were worse things to die for.</p><p>The change poured over Lucas, his blood seemed to boil, his body contorted, and he roared Sarah\u2019s name.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Jordan stumbled back, his hands bloody. \u201cGot some, I got\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fur burst over Lucas\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes,\u201d Dane shouted.</p><p>The wolf within scratched and clawed his way to the surface. The silver still inside burned like a bitch, but something was different now. Maybe his brother had managed to get out enough silver, maybe Josette had worked some of her grand-m\u00e8re\u2019s magic. Either way, the wolf was coming out.</p><p>Sarah.</p><p>She\u2019d be able to link with him now. She had to hear him. Sarah.</p><p>But when he reached for her mind, he only touched darkness. No, not just darkness . . .</p><p>Love . . . Lucas . . . The faintest trace of her voice. It seemed almost like a muted echo, as if he were catching a whisper she\u2019d already voiced.</p><p>Free . . . no extermination list . . . free.</p><p>Sarah was leaving him. The wolf felt it with absolute certainty. He rushed to her, his muzzle pressing against her throat.</p><p>No, stay with me. The man\u2019s order. She was supposed to stay. He\u2019d claimed her in front of the pack. That meant they were mates. Together always.</p><p>Stay. He was desperate now.</p><p>He howled, fear and fury building.</p><p>\u201cThe wolf\u2019s spirit is strong.\u201d That was Josette, and when his head whipped toward her, he saw her sitting on the ground\u2014her eyes were cloudy, a glazed blue. Just like Marie\u2019s. \u201cBut what will you give, wolf? To fight Death, what will you give?\u201d</p><p>Everything. His muzzle pressed against Sarah once more. Stay with me. Not an order. Not anymore. He couldn\u2019t hold the shift, already the wolf\u2019s body was trembling, weakening, and the muscle and flesh of man would be back soon.</p><p>Sarah.</p><p>\u201cAre you strong enough to fight for her?\u201d Josette asked.</p><p>Fur disappeared. The wounds on his chest weren\u2019t as bad. Healing, slowly. Lucas coughed, choked, and rasped, \u201cI\u2019ll do . . . any . . . thing for her . . ..\u201d</p><p>Because she was in him. In the heart that others thought he didn\u2019t have. She\u2019d worked her way inside, slipped right past his guard, and he wasn\u2019t about to go back to the emptiness he\u2019d known before her.</p><p>With Sarah, it wasn\u2019t about pack and responsibility. It wasn\u2019t about the wolves and their safety.</p><p>Just a man and a woman.</p><p>Just . . . life.</p><p>If only she wouldn\u2019t die on him.</p><p>His hand touched her chest. Her heart pounded beneath his touch. Growing stronger, stronger . . .</p><p>\u201cSarah? Come back . . . to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t ever leave you.\u201d Josette. Still with the blind eyes and faraway voice. \u201cBound\u2014spirits, minds, hearts. If you live . . .\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes opened.</p><p>\u201cShe lives.\u201d</p><p>His arms curled around her and he yanked Sarah against him, holding her tight. \u201cYou scared the hell out of me.\u201d Still was scaring him.</p><p>\u201cThe battle isn\u2019t over . . . more to come . . . so many years . . . so much blood . . .\u201d Josette\u2019s voice drifted in the air, slurring a bit.</p><p>Lucas eased back and stared into Sarah\u2019s eyes. Such a deep, beautiful green.</p><p>\u201cGive everything . . .\u201d Josette was almost whispering now, \u201cyou\u2019ll survive all that comes, give nothing . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosette?\u201d Maya sounded worried. \u201cDammit, Josie, what the hell is happening? You can\u2019t do this stuff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you everything I have,\u201d Sarah whispered. \u201cI love you, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Love.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t really been given a lot of that in his life. Didn\u2019t understand it. Didn\u2019t know . . .</p><p>Her lips brushed his jaw. \u201cI . . . should have told you sooner . . . I don\u2019t really understand what . . . the hell happened here tonight . . .\u201d With every word, her voice grew stronger. He grew stronger. \u201cBut we\u2019re okay, right? We\u2019re . . . gonna make it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and held her tighter. Death had been too close. Life and death\u2014the line between them was so very fragile. And humans weren\u2019t the only ones weak enough to fall over that line.</p><p>Linked. Bound. When she left this world, he\u2019d leave, too. Her lashes brushed against his cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d Not in life and not in death.</p><p>Sarah looked up at him. \u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d do more than that. \u201cSarah . . .\u201d</p><p>Josette gasped, her breath wheezing. Lucas glanced over as her eyelids fell closed. Maya grabbed her, holding tight. Brody ran from the woods, heading toward them. \u201cMaya!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d She yelled to him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to her!\u201d</p><p>A shudder rippled over Josette\u2019s body. Her palm opened, revealing Marie\u2019s ring.</p><p>Behind Josette, Lucas saw Piers\u2019s body. Josette\u2019s left hand was touching his side.</p><p>A groan broke from the man\u2019s lips. He rose, blinking. \u201cL-Lucas?\u201d His gaze swept the scene. Saw the remains of Rafe. Saw Lucas holding Sarah tight. Saw the limp arm of the woman who\u2019d been touching him. \u201cJosette.\u201d Need and raw hunger shook his voice.</p><p>But Maya came at him with her own claws. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about hurting her, wolf.\u201d</p><p>Lucas knew he wouldn\u2019t. Piers looked at him, shaking his head, his eyes wide and horrified. \u201cAlpha . . . I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sirens wailed in the distance. Not like the humans would have been able to overlook Brody\u2019s fire and the fire from Marie\u2019s house. Even in this part of town, two blazes wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here,\u201d Jordan said, grabbing Lucas\u2019s arm. Dane took Sarah\u2019s. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He knew they had to flee because he wasn\u2019t healed. Wasn\u2019t ready to bullshit an explanation about the savaged bodies there and the dead demon inside.</p><p>Maya\u2019s gaze raked them. \u201cGo. I can handle the cops.\u201d</p><p>Probably, since she\u2019d been a cop . . . once upon a time. Before a vamp\u2019s bite had changed her life and taken her from that world.</p><p>Piers reached for Josette. \u201cNo damn way, wolf,\u201d Maya snapped and Brody pressed closer to her. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking her.\u201d</p><p>Piers growled.</p><p>\u201cPiers!\u201d</p><p>The blond wolf shifter\u2019s head snapped toward him. Right then, he understood. Oh, did Lucas fucking understand. His mate was against him, her body trembling, and there was no way he\u2019d separate from her.</p><p>But . . .</p><p>Josette didn\u2019t know what was happening. \u201cHeal first, then claim her.\u201d An order from the alpha.</p><p>And Piers had damn well better obey. Lucas could understand the guy going bat-shit crazy because he thought his mate was dead\u2014if Sarah had died\u2014no. He could understand. So Piers wouldn\u2019t be punished, but he would obey now or hell would come.</p><p>Piers lowered his head. His fingers curled into a fist, never touching Josette.</p><p>\u201cHe needs her,\u201d Sarah whispered.</p><p>Just like I need you.</p><p>Piers could fight his battle for Josette. But right then, the priority was getting Sarah and the rest of the pack to safety. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stood, would have stumbled, but Jordan was there.

Because Lucas suspected that Josette wasn\u2019t the same woman she\u2019d been before. He knew power when he smelled it.</p><p>A new mambo seemed to have taken over.</p><p>Dane had hot-wired a truck. Jordan leapt on his bike. The other vehicles couldn\u2019t be traced to them.</p><p>Lucas eased Sarah inside the truck. Her eyes had closed again. Fear pumped through him. \u201cSarah?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes didn\u2019t open. \u201cRelax, Lucas . . . can\u2019t go anywhere . . . without you.\u201d The faintest of smiles curved her lips.</p> <p>He climbed in and pulled her close. \u201cNo, babe, you can\u2019t.\u201d From here on out, they\u2019d be together.</p><p>And if anyone tried to come between them, he\u2019d slaughter the dumbass.</p><p>Because Sarah King was his. He\u2019d bled for her, killed for her, nearly died for her . . . and he\u2019d never give her up. Never.</p><p>When Sarah opened her eyes, she was in a bedroom. Lucas\u2019s bedroom. The window\u2019s broken glass had been repaired. The room was cleaned up and no signs of the old battle remained.</p><p>The mattress was soft beneath her, and Lucas\u2019s hand was a warm weight on her stomach. She stared up at the ceiling, not daring to look at him yet.</p><p>Last night they\u2019d almost died. Somehow, they\u2019d made it through. Rafe hadn\u2019t. One less crazy jerk in the world. One less nightmare to haunt her.</p><p>They\u2019d made it, and she\u2019d told Lucas\u2014I love you.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t said a word back to her. If she hadn\u2019t been barely clinging to consciousness, that would probably have hurt her more then.</p> <p>Since she was fully awake and aware now, it hurt like a bitch.</p><p>She tried to ease away from him, but his hand slipped down and curled around her waist, holding her in place. \u201cThought we covered this,\u201d his voice rumbled. \u201cYou don\u2019t get away from me.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she vaguely remembered something about that. But, what was crystal clear in her head . . . He didn\u2019t say he loved me. We almost died and he never said . . . She swallowed. \u201cI just . . . I\u2014\u201d Great. She didn\u2019t know what to say. What to do.</p><p>\u201cWhile you were sleeping, you called my name.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to embarrass her. She\u2019d already said she loved the guy. So she whispered his name in her sleep. So what?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone has ever dreamed about me before.\u201d His lips pressed against the curve of her shoulder. \u201cHad nightmares, yeah, but not dreamed about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you want the truth . . .\u201d She turned her head and met his bright stare. \u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming about you for months.\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>What did she have to lose? \u201cI wasn\u2019t out of my head last night. It wasn\u2019t pain talking. I meant what I said.\u201d Did you mean what you didn\u2019t say? \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>No more blinks. His gaze bored into hers. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Not that response. \u201cI want everything that you can give me. You said we\u2019re mates. Okay, I don\u2019t know what makes someone a mate or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have my children. Your genetics balance with mine. I knew the first time we had sex that we were compatible.\u201d</p><p>Compatible? She didn\u2019t want compatible. Sarah rolled away from him.</p><p>He caught her arm and rolled her right back. \u201cDammit, I\u2019m messing this up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d Gritted.</p><p>His eyes blazed down at her. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what love is.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>He kissed her. Hard and deep and his taste was right, just what she wanted, and her sex began to moisten. For him. Only him. The guy had ruined her for other men. And not because they were compatible or had a good genetic match.</p><p>His head lifted. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, my life hasn\u2019t exactly been easy.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d noticed.</p><p>\u201cWomen in my life have been around for a few days. I just took the pleasure and walked away. No attachments.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to hear about his pleasure with other women. The guy was really lucky she didn\u2019t have claws.</p><p>\u201cJordan\u2019s my only family. The pack\u2014hell, we don\u2019t know about love. None of us. Obsession. Need. Hunger. Lust. Yeah, we got that.\u201d</p><p>Wolves always understood the darker drives. Animal instinct.</p><p>But it was the man who could love. Didn\u2019t he realize that? \u201cI want you, Sarah. I need you. Hell, sometimes I feel like I need you more than I need my next breath.\u201d</p><p>That was . . . oh.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were dying last night. I could see it, and I just wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to touch you,\u201d she whispered, cutting across his words. \u201cJust one more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was some powerful touch.\u201d His lips skimmed hers.</p><p>\u201cI think you pushed death back for us again.\u201d</p><p>How many more chances would they have?</p><p>\u201cYou know how it works now, don\u2019t you? Whatever magic Marie wove, it can\u2019t be broken,\u201d he said. \u201cOur lives are linked, everything tied together. When one of us dies . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I know.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to her mouth. \u201cYou could do better than me.\u201d Said gruffly. \u201cWe\u2019re bound, but you don\u2019t have to spend your days with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it, wolf,\u201d she warned, her own voice sharp. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about my mate.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cMating doesn\u2019t equal love.\u201d</p><p>Okay, why didn\u2019t he just claw her heart out? \u201cWith you, for me, it does.\u201d</p><p>Lucas stared at her, then his eyelids squeezed shut. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck this up. I\u2019m not easy to live with, hell, nothing about pack is easy.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled over his broad shoulders. \u201cWhat makes you think life with me is easy?\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat makes you think I want easy?\u201d Maybe she should have been trying to spare her pride and pull back from him, but her confession was out there, and she wasn\u2019t going to slink away in shame.</p><p>His eyes open. Burned with so much intensity. \u201cI\u2019m a possessive bastard. I\u2019m wild. The animal inside is too strong. I can\u2019t always control him.\u201d</p><p>Bull. \u201cYou have more control than anyone I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>His legs eased between hers. She could feel his arousal, thick and hard and so long. Aroused, but . . . he wasn\u2019t pushing his flesh against her.</p><p>Sex wasn\u2019t going to solve this. They both seemed to understand that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lie for you, Sarah. Kill for you.\u201d</p><p>He already had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d turn my back on the pack for you . . .\u201d</p><p>Now he had her tensing because that was more of a sacrifice than she\u2019d ever ask of him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I will never want anyone as much as I want you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that I can give you what you need.\u201d</p><p>And he was breaking her heart. Her hand slid down his chest. Pressed once more over the heart that raced so fast. \u201cWhat do you want for me?\u201d</p><p>His brows furrowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want my life to be like?\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed in his jaw. \u201cI want you . . . happy.\u201d Promising. Maybe he really didn\u2019t know. \u201cWhen you\u2019re with me, how do you feel?\u201d</p><p>His breath hissed out. \u201cLike I\u2019ve finally found home.\u201d</p><p>The wolf was going to make her cry. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel when I\u2019m with you. Like I belong. Like I found a part of myself that was missing . . . I didn\u2019t even know it was missing. . . .\u201d Not until she\u2019d walked into a jail and peered at a wolf caged behind the bars. Mine. \u201cI love you, Lucas, and I\u2019m not going to walk away. I won\u2019t give up on us.\u201d Whatever came their way\u2014wolves, wars, pack\u2014she\u2019d stay by his side.</p><p>\u201cLove.\u201d He said the word as if he were tasting it. \u201cYou\u2019re the first thing I think about when I open my eyes. The last damn thing at night. And when I dream . . .\u201d He swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s of you. Sarah, is that close to love?\u201d</p><p>So lost. Her big, bad wolf was strong in so many ways. She\u2019d teach him this. Show him the way. \u201cYes, Lucas, it\u2019s close.\u201d No, better than close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rip apart anyone who hurt you, and damn, woman, I feel like I\u2019d give my soul\u2014or whatever the hell is left of it\u2014just to see you smile.\u201d</p><p>Better than close. \u201cThat\u2019s love,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His brows smoothed. His lips began to curl. \u201cThen Sarah King . . . I love you.\u201d</p><p>She was pretty sure her fast heartbeat shook her chest. Maybe even the whole bed.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you go,\u201d he told her, his mouth so close to hers that she could taste him. Would taste him, very soon.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I\u2019d hate to hunt you down.\u201d She nipped at his lip and felt the tightening of his body.</p><p>\u201cForever, Sarah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever, Lucas,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Bound, linked, always\u2014with her big, bad wolf.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cCaleb\u2019s gone.\u201d Dane spun around as soon as he made the announcement. Shit, okay, he should not have busted into the alpha\u2019s room. But, wow, Sarah had one fine ass.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s growl filled the bedroom. \u201cDon\u2019t look back, Dane.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew a death threat when he heard one. Dane stared into the hallway. \u201cHe slipped away while we were fighting Rafe.\u201d His gut tightened. \u201cDo we hunt him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas . . .\u201d Sarah\u2019s soft voice. Husky. Sounded like pleasure and sex.</p><p>Lucky bastard.</p><p>But maybe, just maybe, he could have the devil\u2019s luck, too. Karen had survived the attack. He\u2019d already checked the hospital. Had to check. She\u2019d survived.</p><p>Now what would he do with her? To her?</p><p>If Caleb hadn\u2019t pulled this vanishing crap, he\u2019d be at Karen\u2019s side right then.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill when he had the chance. He never went for your throat,\u201d Sarah told Lucas.</p><p>Sheets rustled. Dane still didn\u2019t look back as he asked, \u201cIs he Lone?\u201d Cast out. Left to fight and struggle on his own.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s head jerked but he managed\u2014barely\u2014not to glance over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. The pack will judge. All of the pack. Once we find him.\u201d</p><p>Dane stepped into the hallway. \u201cDo we start the hunt now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d More sheets rustled. Dane heard Sarah sigh softly. \u201cI know where he\u2019s going,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one person in town that might be able to help him, and she\u2019s already being watched by pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are the orders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand down\u2014and wait. Our lost wolf will be back. One way or another . . .\u201d</p><p>Josette slipped the ruby ring onto her finger. A perfect fit. Her mother\u2019s ring. Taken when Carline was slaughtered in a dirty alley by a vamp.</p><p>Taken, but then retrieved by another. Maya had recovered the ring when she\u2019d killed the vampire who\u2019d drained Josette\u2019s mother.</p><p>We\u2019re not all monsters. Maya\u2019s words, spoken years ago. Josette just hadn\u2019t wanted to believe her then.</p><p>Now, she knew the truth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you, Josie?\u201d Maya asked quietly. They\u2019d washed away the blood. Bandaged the wounds. Now Josette stood, waiting.</p><p>Because she knew what was coming.</p><p>Thanks to her grand-m\u00e8re, she wasn\u2019t weak anymore. Wouldn\u2019t ever be weak again, and now, she knew everything.</p><p>Not all monsters. No, some paranormals were good, some were bad. Just like humans.</p><p>And they would be coming to her. Over and over. Seeking help. Seeking power. Seeking life.</p><p>Perhaps finding death.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want this,\u201d she whispered to the vampire who\u2019d once been her only friend. In another life . . . so long ago.</p><p>Maya\u2019s hand brushed her shoulder. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d</p><p>Josette shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d No one could.</p><p>She lifted her chin when she heard the creak of the floorboard. The first. Far from the last.</p><p>Not the wolf she\u2019d wanted to see, though, not him. Not yet.</p><p>Caleb McKenzie paused just outside of her doorway. \u201cI-I need your help.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d seen grand-m\u00e8re do this so many times. \u201cAnd what will you give me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>So desperate. That would make him dangerous. The world began to fog around Josette as power fueled her blood. Anything.</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t careful, the wolf would end up trading everything.</p><p>After all, magic demanded a high price.</p><p>It was a lesson Sarah King had learned. She\u2019d paid, she\u2019d loved, and by a trick of fate, she\u2019d lived. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Not everyone could be so lucky.</p><p>But then, Sarah King truly lived a charmed life. </p>  </body></html>"]
