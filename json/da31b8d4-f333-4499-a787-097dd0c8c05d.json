Sam Kelly watched as Sophie turned, watched the wash of desire that flickered in her expressive blue eyes as she found him.</p><p>Before she could reach behind her to tug at the tie to her apron, he had her in his arms, his lips crushing hers in that first sweet taste.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>His name came out in a breathy sigh that he felt all the way to his balls.</p><p>He reached around and took the tie from her and pulled until the work apron she wore came free.</p><p>\u201cAny trouble tonight?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head even as he found her lips again.</p><p>\u201cI hate that you work there.\u201d</p><p>She paused in her kiss, and for a long moment they stood there, their lips barely a breath apart as she stared up at him. Her mouth turned down into an unhappy moue, and he was sorry for spoiling the moment by expressing his dissatisfaction with her job.</p><p>Who was he to say anything at all? She was working in a little dive in Bumfuck, Mexico\u2014a place a girl like her clearly didn\u2019t belong\u2014but maybe it was all she could do to make ends meet. It wasn\u2019t like he could offer to sweep her off her feet and carry her off into the sunset.</p><p>\u201cForget I said anything,\u201d he murmured. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>He tipped a finger under her chin and guided her mouth back to his. He was hungry\u2014starving\u2014for her. Even now his brothers and their team were doing the job he was here for because he wanted a few stolen moments with a woman he hadn\u2019t been able to resist\u2014a woman he\u2019d known he had to have from the moment he walked into the bar where she waitressed.</p><p>A woman who made it too easy to forget duty.</p><p>She leaned into him, warm and unsteady. He lifted her just enough that she could circle his neck with her arms, and she smiled against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be better when you\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>He carried her toward the bed and lowered her onto the mattress until he hovered over her, trapping her underneath his body. His mouth was just over her belly, and he looked up her body, meeting her gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>With slow, methodical movements that belied his urgency, he slid her T-shirt up, baring her slim waist.</p><p>Even as he raised it higher over her breasts, he tongued the shallow indention of her navel. She shivered beneath his lips and a fine smattering of chill bumps raced across her belly.</p><p>She arched her back almost as if she\u2019d buck him off, but he left her shirt and gripped her hips, holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d</p> <p>She shuddered and let out a light whimper when he licked up her midline and caught his teeth on the band of her bra. He grinned and levered himself upward so that his knees were on either side of her hips, and she was effectively trapped.</p><p>Impatient to have her undressed, he grasped the hem of her T-shirt and ripped it up the middle until it lay in two pieces on either side of her. It hung from her arms, and he simply pulled until she was free.</p><p>Her nipples puckered and strained against the lacy cups of her bra. The material shielded nothing of the dark crescents. Idly he toyed with the nubs through the satin, touching and molding until they were hard points begging to be set free.</p><p>The swells plumped over the edge of the cups, and with a light flick, he pushed them free, baring her nipples so they peeked over the bra.</p><p>Her hands crept up his thighs, sliding over the rough denim of his jeans, but he reached down and grasped her wrists, pulling her away.</p><p>She started to protest, but he brought one hand to his mouth and kissed her palm before raising her arms over her head. He leaned until they were pressed to the mattress, and once again she was captured.</p><p>In a moment of inspiration, he gathered the tattered remains of her T-shirt and tied one wrist to the head-board. She gasped, her eyes going wide when he took her other hand and secured it as well.</p><p>Her breathing speeded up and her chest heaved. She licked her lips nervously, but her eyes darkened to sapphire. His smile was slow and predatory. She was like a drug. A high he didn\u2019t want to come down from. She made him feel strong and invincible.</p><p>\u201cNow what to do with you?\u201d</p><p>He reached into his jeans and pulled out his pocket-knife. Her eyes widened slightly, but no fear shone in her gaze. He flipped the knife open and tucked the blade underneath the band of her bra. The material fell away, baring her breasts to his hungry gaze.</p><p>He closed the knife and tossed it aside, then turned his attention to the clasp of her jeans. He wanted to rip them from her, but he forced himself to take his time and to savor each inch of her flesh he unveiled.</p><p>He worked the jeans over her hips and then down her legs, moving so he could free her entirely. Her shapely legs drew him. He ran his finger up the slim lines and curves and then followed with his mouth, kissing and licking a path to the silky scrap of underwear that shielded her pussy.</p><p>He tucked one finger behind the lace, threading through the curls into the slick folds. She moaned and twisted restlessly when he found her clit. For a moment he played, stroking his fingertip over the sensitive nub. Then he slipped down until he rimmed her entrance, teasing her mercilessly.</p><p>With one push, he was inside. Liquid velvet closed around his finger, and he closed his eyes as he imagined his cock there, gliding through her tight, swollen heat.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d</p><p>Her agonized cry jerked him back to awareness. Her face was flushed, her eyes glittering with need.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged.</p><p>He ripped the panties, no longer patient, no longer willing to prolong his seduction. He wanted her. Had to have her. Now.</p><p>His shirt came off and sailed across the room. He rolled to the side and yanked at his jeans, cursing under his breath when they snagged around his ankles.</p><p>Where the fuck was the condom? Pocket. Shit. He leaned over the bed to pick the pants back up and yanked several packets out. They spilled onto the bed as he rolled back over. He grabbed one and ripped it open as he straddled her again.</p><p>Her gaze was riveted on his groin. Her eyes flashed appreciatively, and in response he reached down, grasped his cock and stroked.</p><p>She strained against her bonds, and it only made him harder and more eager to take her.</p><p>With a shaking hand, he rolled the condom on and then reached down to spread her legs.</p><p>God, she was so soft and beautiful. Delicate and feminine. The silky blond curls were damp with desire, and he ran his thumb down the seam of her pussy before pushing her legs farther apart.</p><p>She was open to him. Open and unguarded. His to take. His to pleasure. His to taste and to touch.</p><p>He rose over her, tucking his cock against her small opening. He could never get over that first thrust, where her body fought his size and her pussy closed around him like a vise. He was sweating and shaking like a teenager, and he hadn\u2019t even gotten inside her yet.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for me, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>He nudged inward just enough that the head spread her opening and he could feet her heat.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sam. I need you.\u201d</p><p>Those softly uttered words sent him over the edge. He gripped her hips and dove deep. She gasped. All the breath left his body in a groan of intense agony.</p><p>She writhed beneath him, trapped. Her mouth opened and closed, and her arms strained against the bonds at her wrists. She surrounded his dick like warm honey. So sweet. So hot. He\u2019d never felt anything to match the sensation of being inside her.</p><p>When she bucked upward in protest of his not moving, he withdrew, and they both moaned at the sensation of him rippling through her flesh.</p><p>\u201cGod, honey, you\u2019re so tight. You feel so damn good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe fit,\u201d she said on a moan. \u201cYou fit me. Perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d he growled as he swooped downward to devour her mouth.</p><p>He flexed his hips and sank deep again. He swallowed her gasp of pleasure, savored it, then returned it in his next breath as their tongues mimicked the action of their bodies.</p><p>There was no thinking. Only the slick, hot feel of her against his cock. His brain went numb as he lost himself. Deeper. Harder.</p><p>The rest slipped away. No mission. No asshole who needed killing. No frustration because KGI\u2019s efforts had met with no results.</p><p>Here it was just the two of them. And mindless, perfect pleasure.</p><p>He reached down to hook his forearms underneath her knees. He pulled hard, and the angle sent him deeper, until he was wedged so tight that his balls were crammed against her pussy.</p><p>He glanced up, meeting her gaze, making sure she was with him and that he hadn\u2019t hurt her. Only her desperate need for release stared back at him.</p><p>With a savage cry, he pulled back and then hammered into her, rocking the entire bed as he thrust over and over. Her eyes slammed shut and her cry split the air. She went tight, so tight, as every muscle in her body tensed, and then suddenly she went liquid around him, bathing him in intense heat.</p><p>He threw back his head, closed his own eyes and pounded forward one last time before his release gathered in his balls and shot up his cock. He erupted painfully, the pleasure so staggeringly intense that he lost himself for one brief moment.</p><p>His hips still flexed spasmodically as he carefully lowered himself onto her limp body. She trembled as their flesh met, and her lips brushed over his jaw as he laid his head against her shoulder.</p><p>He was still buried deep and he had no desire to move. She felt good surrounding him, holding him in her body. He moved his hips again, a shudder rolling down his spine at the nearly painful sensation over his cock.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d he asked against her skin.</p><p>She hummed, a content purring sound that told him he\u2019d done no such thing. Still, she spoke softly against his hair, reassuring him that he\u2019d given her as much pleasure as he\u2019d taken.</p><p>Though he hated to move, he knew he was crushing her. Carefully he pushed himself up and then withdrew from her body. Damn but he was still hard.</p><p>He reached up to untie her and then rolled away to discard the condom. When he moved back, she immediately curled into him all soft and limber. Her hands moved over his body almost frantically, as if being denied the ability to touch him had made her all the more desperate to do so now.</p><p>He caught one of her hands and tugged it down until her fingers circled his cock.</p><p>\u201cSee what you do to me? I shouldn\u2019t be hard again for two weeks after that, but I seem to stay that way around you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly and ran her hand up and down his length, exploring every inch.</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019ll wait long enough for me to grab a shower? Do you mind?\u201d Her nose wrinkled in distaste. \u201cI smell like beer.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her neck, licking over her pulse. \u201cYou smell wonderful, but yeah, go get a shower.\u201d He felt a twinge of guilt for having ambushed her as soon as she\u2019d walked in. He should have let her shower and rest. She\u2019d been on her feet the entire evening.</p><p>She reached up and kissed him before rolling away. He watched her, enjoying the gentle sway of her hips and ass as she walked naked to the bathroom.</p><p>She was one hundred percent woman. Soft and feminine, with curves in all the right places. She was everything his job wasn\u2019t, and maybe that\u2019s why she appealed so strongly to him.</p><p>He lay there for a long moment, and finally after five minutes, he figured he\u2019d given her enough time to wash. If she hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d finish the job for her.</p><p>He got off the bed and went into the bathroom, where the steam from the shower had already fogged the mirror. She was standing motionless in the shower, her body blurred by the glass.</p><p>It was enough to send his blood roaring to life. God almighty but he couldn\u2019t explain her effect on him. It was crazy and left him feeling unbalanced.</p><p>He opened the door, and before she could turn around, he slipped into the shower with her, his body molding to hers. She started to turn, but he stopped her, holding her still.</p><p>He lowered his mouth to her neck, where little droplets of water beaded and rolled down her skin. Her knees buckled and she threatened to fall when his teeth sank into the slim column of her throat. He caught her and held her tight.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands on the wall.\u201d</p><p>She put her palms on the tile and slid them up until her arms were above her head. He arched against her then reached down and hooked her right leg with his hand. He pulled up, lifting her while he held her steady with his other arm.</p><p>While the water beat down on them, he thrust into her, finding her warmth all over again. It was never enough. It would never be enough.</p><p>In the back of his mind, a warning flashed. He hadn\u2019t used a condom, but he was lost in the feel of her silky heat against his bare flesh. His mind screamed stupid, but the male roared that she was his and he\u2019d take what was his.</p><p>She tightened around him. Her fingers curled into fists against the shower wall. She threw her head back, arching into him as he marked her neck with his mouth.</p><p>His.</p><p>It was primitive and hard core. It puzzled him even as he knew it couldn\u2019t be explained.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>His release when it came was quicksilver. A lightning flash that was intense and painful and had him arching to tiptoe as he strained to get deeper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She made a small sound, and her hands slid down the walls as if she\u2019d lost any remaining strength. She sagged and he caught her gently to him. He was filled with an odd tenderness as he reached up to turn the water off and then settled her into his arms.</p><p>He stepped from the shower and put her down long enough to wrap a towel around her. For a long time they stood there, her forehead resting on his chest as they both tried to catch up.</p><p>She snuggled sleepily into his arms, and again, guilt assailed him as he imagined how tired she must be. He kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get some sleep. You\u2019re exhausted.\u201d</p> <p>She turned her face up to his and smiled even as her eyelids drooped. Then she rose up on tiptoe to curl her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cTake me to bed,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>SAM woke with Sophie in the crook of his arm, her head resting on his shoulder. He was tempted to roll over and slide between her legs and wake them both up with a quick orgasm. But she looked tired and a little fragile, like maybe she\u2019d had a rough night at work.</p><p>He pulled her closer and ran the tips of his fingers up and down her arm. The strands of hair closest to his mouth fluttered with his every breath, and he hooked a finger around them to pull them away from her cheek.</p> <p>Her eyelids fluttered and opened, and sleepy blue eyes stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he murmured</p><p>She responded by snuggling deeper into his side. Her sigh was all he heard, and her arm crept around his waist, linking them tighter together.</p><p>He chuckled lightly and kissed the top of her head. \u201cContent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm hmmm.\u201d</p><p>It was easy here in this hotel room. Everything else seemed a world away and they were removed from reality. He wasn\u2019t stupid enough to embrace that, but it was nice, just for a while, to get a sense that the only thing that mattered was right here and right now.</p> <p>\u201cFeel like eating something?\u201d</p><p>She raised her head. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, a knock sounded at the door. What the hell? He frowned, then eased from underneath Sophie.</p><p>\u201cStay here and out of sight.\u201d</p><p>He yanked his jeans on and went to the door, opening it just a crack. The man from the front desk stood there holding a sealed envelope.</p><p>\u201cFor you, se\u00f1or. It was marked as urgent.\u201d</p><p>Sam took the envelope. \u201cThank you.\u201d He closed the door and turned the envelope over in his hand. It didn\u2019t have a name, but then he hadn\u2019t used his real name here. It was only marked \u201c304 Urgent.\u201d Underlined three times.</p> <p>He glanced up at Sophie, who sat up in the bed, the covers drawn to her chin. Then he ripped open the seal and pulled out the single piece of paper.</p><p>At first he didn\u2019t make sense of the short message. When realization hit him in the gut, his first reaction was disbelief. Was someone fucking with him? He needed to get back to his men. This could be complete bullshit, but it was the first potential break KGI had caught in their mission to take Alex Mouton and his extensive arms network down.</p><p>For two weeks Sam and his brothers had posed as buyers, trying to make contact with Mouton. And nothing. Either the man was a suspicious bastard or he had no interest in gaining new clients. Which told Sam that his current clientele was paying him a fuckload of money.</p><p>A chill slithered up his spine. Why the anonymous warning? Who had known what the Kelly Group was really after? They\u2019d been careful. They\u2019d done everything right. Blended in with the locals. Given no one any reason to believe they were anything but who they said they were. Even Sam\u2019s illicit liaisons with Sophie had gone a long way in building his cover. Because what kind of dumbass came on a covert op and then spent his time fucking a local waitress to distraction?</p><p>\u201cSam, is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Her soft voice settled over him, soothing some of the tension. He crumpled the note in his hand after committing it to memory. He shoved it into his pocket and focused again on Sophie. Sophie who sat naked in his bed. Sophie who he wouldn\u2019t ever see again.</p><p>He crossed the room and slid onto the edge of the bed beside her. She stared back at him, her eyes puzzled, and there was a hint of something else there. Fear?</p><p>He touched her cheek in an effort to reassure her. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. Something\u2019s come up. Something important.\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled, hating what he had to say next.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know when\u2014if\u2014I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Her face became impassive. Her usually expressive eyes were shuttered and distant.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Before he could say anything else, she leaned up and wrapped her arms around his neck. The sheet fell, baring her breasts. She kissed him. Just once. With all the sweetness she\u2019d brought into his life in just a short time.</p><p>He savored the taste and the sensation and knew he\u2019d never have this again. Regret tightened his chest.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He touched her cheek and then kissed her again. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE waited long enough that she was sure Sam wouldn\u2019t return to the room, and then she hurriedly dressed, making sure she left nothing behind. In the bathroom, she twisted her hair in a quick knot and thrust a pick from her bag through the knot to hold it.</p><p>The woman staring back at her in the mirror was young, amusedly fresh-faced and deceptively innocent looking. She felt none of those things but knew people only saw what they wanted to see. No one ever took her seriously or saw her as a threat.</p><p>That would end today.</p><p>Taking one last sweep of the room, she saw Sam\u2019s knife lying on the floor where he\u2019d tossed it after cutting her bra off. She stooped down to retrieve it and then shoved it into her pocket. There would be no evidence he was here, and she might just need it later.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she cracked open the door and peeked out of the room and down the hall. Satisfied no one was about, she hurried to the stairs, bypassing the corridor leading to the elevator.</p><p>On the first floor, there were two doors in the alcove, one leading to the lobby and one leading outside into the alley beside the hotel. She ducked outside to see the car waiting for her.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, she strode to the dark Mercedes. The driver got out, somber-looking in a dark suit and sunglasses that completely obscured his eyes. He was nameless and faceless, just like everyone else in her father\u2019s organization. Just as she was.</p><p>He opened the door to the backseat, and she was swallowed by the armored vehicle.</p><p>The driver took her through the back edges of town, through crumbling cobblestone streets, some of which had huge gaps where sand and rock took over. The car drew no curious stares. The residents here were well used to her father\u2019s presence and had learned not to ask questions.</p><p>They left the rows of shabby houses and turned onto a winding dirt road that led into the hills surrounding the remote town. When finally they approached the stern spires that guarded her father\u2019s compound, the driver slowed and then punched a series of commands into the remote installed in the dash.</p><p>The heavy iron gate swung open to admit them, and they zoomed rapidly up the paved driveway. A thick line of trees obscured the view of the sprawling house, and in fact there was only a small hole through the dense line, where the car seemingly disappeared into a forest, only to burst through the other side to a sight that was deceptively idyllic.</p><p>To a little girl, it had been fairyland. She hadn\u2019t been that little girl in a long time.</p><p>Instead of pulling around front where the circle drive surrounded a huge fountain, the driver parked at the side of the house, under an awning that sheltered three other armored vehicles.</p><p>He opened the door, and Sophie blinked at the wash of sunshine that slapped her in the face. She stepped out and glanced up at the driver.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is what you want to do?\u201d he asked in a low voice.</p><p>She merely nodded, not trusting that she wouldn\u2019t be overheard if she responded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>This time she didn\u2019t react. She walked past the driver and inserted her security card into the slot beside the door leading into the house. Her father would be alerted to her presence, and he\u2019d be waiting for her. He never came to her. She was expected to go to him and give a report just like any of his employees.</p><p>A maid met her in the hallway to her father\u2019s office. Sophie didn\u2019t meet her gaze. The maid stared straight ahead, but as Sophie approached, the maid reached under her apron and handed a small bag to her as she passed.</p><p>It was a designer handbag, something her father would expect her to have. He\u2019d probably bought this one. She tucked it under her arm and stopped in front of the double door at the end of the corridor.</p><p>She raised her hand to knock but stopped in midair. She shook from head to toe, and sweat beaded her forehead. Each breath seemed dragged from her, heavy and sluggish. Her heart thumped wildly, until she was sure it was audible in the silence.</p><p>Swallowing back her fear, she squared her shoulders and knocked. She\u2019d need every bit of composure she could muster. Her father could spot weakness in a second.</p><p>The doors opened automatically, and she stepped forward. Miraculously her fear subsided when she looked across the room to see her father standing against the huge picture window. It, like everything, was deceptive. What looked like a foolhardy extravagance for a man as wanted as he, was in actuality a one-way reflective plate of the highest-tech bulletproof material available. It wasn\u2019t even on the market yet.</p><p>He could see out, but no one could see in.</p><p>\u201cSophie, you have information?\u201d</p><p>The casual way in which he posed the question didn\u2019t in any way fool her. Her father wasn\u2019t casual about anything. He was coldly aloof and calculating. He didn\u2019t expect obedience. He demanded it. With chillingly positive results.</p><p>She glanced around the room, searching out the position of his guards. There were two inside. At least a dozen outside. Each willing to give his life for the man who owned him. Today she was happy to accommodate them.</p><p>\u201cI do have something that might interest you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He raised a speculative eyebrow as if he couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d proven useful. She made a show of opening her handbag as if she had something to give him.</p><p>Her fingers slid over the rubber stock of the gun, and then one finger curled over the cool metal trigger. In a lightning move, she turned and shot through the bag, downing the first guard. Before the second could react, she fired again, the heavy plunk of the bullet as it smacked his neck the only sound in the room.</p><p>The bag fell away, revealing the long barrel of the silencer. Her father stared unflinchingly at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t talking to the bastard. No stupid games. She had precious seconds to make her getaway before all hell broke loose on his command.</p><p>She raised the pistol, and just before she fired, she saw the surprised shock in her father\u2019s eyes. He fell heavily, blood spreading on the polished wood floors.</p><p>She yanked the knife from her pocket and rushed over to where he lay. Shoving the collar of his shirt down, she reached for the leather thong that circled his neck and slashed it free.</p><p>The thin cylindrical piece of metal lay against his skin, smeared with his blood. She grabbed it, then went to his desk and felt for the button underneath.</p><p>Across the room a panel of the floor slid open, revealing a staircase leading down into the underground network of pathways.</p><p>Without a single glance back, she hit the stairs running. She\u2019d spent months memorizing the layout. She knew every path, every turn by heart even though she\u2019d never been below. Relying on those long hours of studying the computerized plans, she made her way to the exit where the driver waited for her.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she rushed into the sun and breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the car there waiting. He hadn\u2019t betrayed her.</p><p>He ushered her inside, and when she was settled in the back, he glanced at her in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cIt is done?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. \u201cThank you for helping me.\u201d</p><p>The slight incline of his jaw was the only acknowledgment he gave her, as he gunned the engine and roared off. She never looked back. There was nothing for her there.</p><p>As the miles passed, she let herself relax. And she dared to hope the impossible.</p><p>Freedom.</p><p>Finally, she was free.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Five months later</p><p>SOPHIE throttled back and the boat slowed, coming to a near standstill in Kentucky Lake. Darkness shrouded her. The sky was overcast. New moon. Only one or two stars poked through the cloud cover. She was running with no lights and keeping to the middle of the lake until she was sure she was close enough to her destination to move quickly to shore.</p><p>She studied the small handheld GPS and then lifted her gaze up the shoreline to the north. According to her coordinates, her destination was another mile down the lake.</p><p>She swallowed her fear and nervousness and automatically put her hand on her belly in a soothing motion. Would Sam even be there? How would he react to seeing her again? What would he say when he knew the truth about her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced nervously over her shoulder into the darkness. The lake was a slosh of midnight ink. The only sound she could hear was the low chop against the hull of her boat.</p><p>Her nerves were shot. She knew she was taking a risk, but she was out of options. Her uncle\u2019s cronies were closing in on her. She could smell them. She could feel them in every part of her body. There\u2019d been too many close calls in the last weeks.</p><p>A smart woman recognized when she could no longer do things on her own. She considered herself a smart woman, which was why she was here. In a damn boat on a damn lake trying to find the father of her baby so hopefully he could protect them both.</p><p>After five months of running, the idea of being in such a vulnerable place scared her witless. True, it wasn\u2019t as if she drove boldly into Dover, asked where to find Sam Kelly and then parked in front of his house. She had that much sense. Sam would be the first person her uncle expected her to run to. Which was why she\u2019d stayed away for so long.</p> <p>And then there was the fact that neither she nor Sam had been honest with the other. Both had been other people. The only real thing between them had been the intense desire. She\u2019d fallen fast and she\u2019d fallen hard.</p><p>For a man who\u2019d despise her once he learned the truth.</p><p>She eased the boat forward, following the line on her GPS. With any luck, she\u2019d dock right in Sam\u2019s backyard and hope to hell she didn\u2019t get shot for trespassing.</p><p>A noise ahead and to the left alerted her. Her head rose and she stared, her nostrils flaring as she sucked in the chilly night air.</p><p>A sudden blast of light blinded her. She threw up her arm to shield her face, but it was no use.</p> <p>The roar of an engine accelerating kicked her self-preservation into gear. Without hesitation, she dove overboard. She smacked into the cold water and felt the shock to her toes.</p><p>The larger boat hit hers with a resounding crack. Debris flew into the air and pelted the water all around her. A huge chunk hit the surface in front of her and blew water over her head.</p><p>Her mouth filled with water, and she pushed it out before rolling to swim toward shore. She hadn\u2019t gotten a full breath, and already her lungs were tight with the need for air.</p><p>She surfaced and sucked in a huge breath. Pain exploded in her arm, and she inhaled another mouthful of water. Shock splintered with needle-like awareness. She touched her arm and felt warmth. Liquid warmth.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Son of a bitch had shot her! Terror hit her like a sledgehammer. She fought to keep her panic at bay. She had to hold it together. Why the hell had he shot her?</p> <p>Her hair went straight upward, and her neck popped back as a hand yanked her out of the water. She banged over the side of a boat, and she had the presence of mind to wrap her arms protectively around her middle.</p><p>Her baby. She had to protect her baby.</p><p>She landed with a crash on the deck of the boat and squinched her eyes shut against the beam of light shining into her face.</p><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>She cracked open one eye and stared up at the man looming over her. She glanced around and saw no one else.</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself.\u201d</p><p>He kicked her in the arm and agony ricocheted through her body. Then he reached down, curled his hand in her hair and hauled her upright.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t still been holding her, she would have gone down. Her legs refused to cooperate. Her arm was on fire and hung loosely at her side.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is the key, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t even know you,\u201d she spit out. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to call me by my first name. Or at all. Do you think I\u2019m stupid enough to carry it around with me?\u201d</p><p>A flash of silver caught her gaze. Her eyes widened when she saw the wicked curve of a very sharp blade. The she raised her gaze higher and saw cold determination in the face of the assassin.</p><p>Forcing bravado into her voice, she said, \u201cIf you kill me, you get squat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fact you\u2019re counting on I\u2019m sure,\u201d he said in a flat tone. \u201cMy orders are to make you talk. Any way that has to happen. Trust me, you\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and sucked in air through her nostrils. God, what was she going to do? She\u2019d been so close to Sam. So damn close.</p><p>All these months, all this time, she\u2019d stayed to the shadows, always one step ahead of her father\u2019s grasp. Even dead, he held her by the throat. Her uncle would carry on his legacy of selling death. There was always someone willing to take up the reins.</p><p>But without access to her father\u2019s wealth and his resources, Tomas was crippled. She planned to keep him that way.</p><p>The man hauled her close, his breath blowing hot across her face. She felt the edge of the knife against her belly and bile rose sharp in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die. Not at first. But your baby will. Tell me what I want to know or I\u2019ll slice you open and let your child spill out of your belly.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach revolted and she gagged, the knot so big that she choked. Tears stung her eyes, and then rage blew hot like the first wave of a blast.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d she bit out.</p><p>She\u2019d had enough. The fact that she was constantly underestimated usually worked in her favor, but this guy seemed smarter than the other assholes her father employed. Indeed he was smarter than her father, who hadn\u2019t believed she\u2019d shoot her own flesh and blood.</p><p>This bastard wasn\u2019t going to give her any easy passes because she was cute and blond and innocent-looking. Which meant she had to rely on sheer grit and determination if she was going to keep her baby alive.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d she gasped out. \u201cPut the knife away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it just where it is.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to make this easy.</p><p>She was careful not to glance down, not to even twitch. No advance warning when she made her move. She waited until she nearly jittered out of her skin. There. The knife eased just a bit and no longer bit as hard into her skin.</p><p>She rammed her knee into his balls and crashed her elbow down onto his wrist. The knife clattered to the deck and she kicked it hard, sending it spiraling across the boat.</p><p>He grabbed her by the neck, his fingers digging deep into her skin despite the fact he was hunched over holding his balls with his free hand.</p><p>His hand squeezed mercilessly, cutting off her air supply.</p><p>She was going to die.</p><p>Here on a boat probably not far from where Sam lived. On the lake, to make the disposal of her body easier. At the hands of an asshole who talked about murder like he would the weather.</p><p>Rage. Red-hot and searing. It splintered through her veins like volcanic fury.</p><p>Faking surrender, she let every muscle in her body go limp. Maybe it caught him off guard, or maybe he expected her to fight, because his grip eased.</p><p>Harnessing her anger, she bolted forward, throwing herself against the asshole. Forearms across his chest, she shoved, putting every ounce of her strength behind her movements.</p><p>He staggered backward, his feet stumbling to catch up with the rest of him. His hands flew up, and he tried to grab the railing.</p><p>She jumped on him, and they both went over the side.</p><p>The cold water hit her like a ton of bricks.</p><p>Down she went into the darkness. She fought off panic and struck out, swimming away from the boat. Several yards out, she broke the surface, gasping for breath.</p><p>He was out there. Probably close. But it would take him precious time to get back into the boat to look for her. Time she could use to her advantage.</p><p>This time she took a deeper breath as she dove back under, and she forced herself to stay under until shadows grew around her consciousness. She broke the surface and kept her head down as she hungrily sucked in air.</p><p>She glanced back to see the spotlight from the boat dancing across the water.</p><p>She inhaled quickly and ducked beneath the water again. Ignoring the agonizing pain in her arm, she swam deep and hard. Eventually, her body grew numb from the cold, and the pain receded. She gave a quick murmur of thanks and pushed herself onward.</p><p>For how long she repeated the endless cycle of surfacing, taking a breath and going back below, she didn\u2019t know. It felt like hours. She wasn\u2019t cognizant of anything but the need to survive.</p><p>When her strength finally gave out and the adrenaline fled her system, she broke the surface and looked back. To her immense relief, she didn\u2019t see the boat. No lights, just murky darkness.</p><p>The lake lapped gently at her chin as she treaded water. And suddenly the pain came rushing back with the force of a car crash.</p><p>Barely conscious, she feebly struck out for shore, but it seemed a mile away. The current tugged at her legs, sucking her back and down the river channel instead of allowing her to move toward the bank.</p><p>Exhausted, she stopped fighting and turned on her back to float the best she could. She had to get out of the water. He\u2019d be looking for her.</p><p>Her head cracked against something hard, and she let out a startled cry. She briefly fell underneath the water in panic. When she surfaced, she jerked around to see a large log bobbing in front of her.</p><p>Grateful for something to hold on to, she hauled her body up and draped herself over the trunk. The wet bark abraded her cheek, but she was too exhausted to give a damn.</p><p>She reached with her good arm and placed her hand over her belly. Her baby had to be okay. She had to be. She closed her eyes as she waited for some response from within. Just a tiny kick. Even a bump just to let Sophie know her baby was safe.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>She ran her hand up her arm, feeling for how bad the bullet wound was. In the water, it was impossible to tell. She whispered a fervent prayer that the night\u2019s events hadn\u2019t harmed her baby.</p><p>Again she lowered her palm, feeling for movement.</p><p>She fought back the panic. It was common for a baby to be still after Mama suffered a shock. She\u2019d read that somewhere in one of those pregnancy books.</p><p>She\u2019d become an expert at self-treatment because she hadn\u2019t dared seek medical help. Tomas would have found her instantly. So she devoured every book she could lay her hands on. She took over-the-counter vitamins, drank her milk and exercised so she\u2019d remain on alert. For just such an occasion as when her father\u2019s men caught up to her.</p><p>There was one star overhead. Just one, but it looked blurry and distant. It bobbed up and down, and she didn\u2019t know if it was because she shook so violently or if the lake was rough.</p><p>Her arm wrapped tighter around the log, and she pressed her cheek against the wet bark. She could ride it for a while, and maybe it would drift out of the faster current toward the calmer waters of the lake.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered even as she fought to stay conscious. Something warm and wet ran down her arm. Blood. It smelled like blood.</p><p>Sam.</p><p>His image rose vividly to mind. Her last coherent thought was that she had to get to Sam.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>THE morning sun shone bright on the back deck of Sam Kelly\u2019s Kentucky Lake home. The wood was warm underneath his bare feet, and the rays chased the chill of the morning away. It had the makings of a truly spectacular day.</p><p>The only way it would have been more perfect is if he was on the lake, fishing pole in one hand, a beer in the other. At least he had the beer covered.</p><p>He drained the remainder from his can, then crumpled it and tossed it across the deck into the garbage can.</p><p>\u201cNice shot,\u201d Donovan drawled from his indelicate sprawl over one of the lounge chairs.</p><p>A brief cool breeze blew over Sam\u2019s face, reminding him that spring hadn\u2019t fully sprung yet.</p><p>He glanced over at his younger brother and motioned for him to toss him another beer.</p><p>Donovan tossed him a can and then looked in Garrett\u2019s direction. Sam\u2019s other younger brother\u2014not that Garrett acted like anyone\u2019s younger brother\u2014held up his hand for one and Donovan aimed a beer in his direction also.</p><p>Garrett cracked it open and then turned his attention back to the barbeque, where he flipped the burgers.</p><p>Only the sizzle of the grill could be heard. That and the hiss of the can as Sam tabbed his open.</p><p>\u201cEthan and Rachel get out okay this morning?\u201d Donovan asked, finally breaking the silence.</p><p>Sam looked in Garrett\u2019s direction since he\u2019d know better than anyone else.</p><p>Garrett nodded. \u201cYeah, they left for the airport at the ass crack of dawn. Rachel was understandably nervous but very excited to be off to Hawaii for two weeks. She and Ethan both need the break.\u201d</p><p>Of all the brothers, and they all loved Rachel dearly\u2014she was the only sister-in-law in the family\u2014Garrett was closest to her, and the most protective. But then he had a protective streak a mile wide when it came to the people he loved.</p><p>Sam leaned back and stared over the lake. He tuned out Garrett\u2019s and Van\u2019s discussion about Rachel\u2019s recovery. They got on the subject of Christmas, and Sam tensed, withdrawing even more. Christmas was a touchy subject. Not that it hadn\u2019t been wonderful this year. Rachel\u2019s first holiday back in the Kelly fold.</p><p>Watching her smile and her eyes light up like a child\u2019s had been worth every minute.</p><p>But Christmas had been just after he\u2019d come back from Mexico. Right after Sophie had disappeared. It was stupid to dwell on her, but inevitably his thoughts drifted to her. Her smile. Her eyes. How good they were in bed. How she responded to his touch. How she felt when he was buried to the balls in her sweet, receptive body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nothing about that mission had gone according to plan. They hadn\u2019t taken Alex Mouton down. They didn\u2019t even know where the bastard had disappeared to. The only thing they had done was take down a huge arms shipment. All in all, just a stumbling block for a man with Mouton\u2019s resources.</p><p>And Sophie hadn\u2019t been there when he\u2019d gone back.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t even supposed to have gone back. It had never been his plan. But he\u2019d found himself making excuses about following up loose ends and had taken off, determined to find Sophie. And do what? That much he hadn\u2019t ever figured out. He just knew he had to see her again. He\u2019d been saved making the decision of what next because she\u2019d disappeared. No one seemed to know a damn thing about her, or if they did, they weren\u2019t talking.</p><p>It took Sam a minute to figure out that his brothers were speaking to him.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Sam, wake up over there.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked up to see both Van and Garrett staring hard at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d Garrett asked. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been yourself since we got back from Mexico.\u201d</p><p>Sam stiffened. He hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been wearing a sign advertising his issues with Mexico.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not still hung up on that chick are you?\u201d Garrett asked in a disbelieving tone.</p> <p>Sam shot him a withering stare. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Garrett shook his head in disgust. He turned to Van and jerked his thumb in Sam\u2019s direction. \u201cWe\u2019re in fucking Mexico trying to set up a buy with Alex Mouton, and lover boy takes time out to have some hot fling with a waitress in one of the local watering holes.\u201d</p><p>Donovan shrugged. \u201cSo? He still has a dick. Bound to use it sometime.\u201d</p><p>Sam choked back a laugh. God love Van. Not an uptight bone in his body.</p><p>Donovan turned his stare on Sam, and Sam began to fidget uncomfortably. He\u2019d rather not talk about it.</p><p>As if sensing just that, Donovan turned back to Garrett. \u201cMaybe you need to get laid, man. Maybe you wouldn\u2019t be so goddamn uptight all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett flipped his brother off, and Sam smiled.</p><p>It didn\u2019t do him any good to think about Sophie. They\u2019d been good together. Damn good.</p><p>No, he had no business getting involved with her when he was involved in a highly sensitive mission. But her sweetness had provided a much-needed balm to what was otherwise a hellish assignment. An assignment that he hadn\u2019t gotten anywhere on until the very end, when an anonymous informant delivered the information Sam and his team had sought\u2014on a silver platter.</p><p>\u201cYou hung up on this chick?\u201d Donovan asked.</p><p>Sam glared at him. Apparently he hadn\u2019t been able to resist after all.</p><p>Donovan held up his hands in surrender. \u201cOkay, okay, I know when to back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sam muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou realize you haven\u2019t taken another mission since Mexico,\u201d Donovan said mildly. \u201cSteele and Rio are getting restless. I didn\u2019t realize we were all on vacation.\u201d</p> <p>Sam frowned. He hadn\u2019t considered that they were on vacation either, but Donovan\u2019s statement brought home to him just how picky he\u2019d been over the last few months.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining,\u201d Donovan continued. \u201cI was thinking of a vacation. Somewhere south. Lots of cute college girls. Sand, sun, sex. Lots of sex.\u201d</p><p>Sam tuned him out again as he and Garrett extolled the virtues of bikini-clad college coeds. Hell, they were all too old for college girls, but then who put an age limit on fantasies?</p><p>It annoyed him that he still thought of Sophie. Then he frowned. How old was she? She was young. Not college-age young, but still young. There was a lot he hadn\u2019t found out about her. They\u2019d always been too busy making love to do any talking.</p><p>He tuned back into the conversation when he heard Nathan and Joe mentioned.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing what?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cMan, you are out of it,\u201d Donovan muttered. \u201cGot an email from them this morning. Said they were bugging out soon and couldn\u2019t give more details. They didn\u2019t want Ma and Rachel to worry, so we\u2019re supposed to tell them they\u2019re on another training mission.\u201d</p><p>Sam snorted. \u201cAs if Mom will believe that. She has a nose for our lies. She sniffs us out every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let Van tell her. She always believes him,\u201d Garrett offered. \u201cIt\u2019s the rest of us who can\u2019t get away with shit.\u201d</p><p>Donovan sent them both smug looks. \u201cFavored son status does have its perks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when are you going to snap out of this funk, Sam?\u201d Garrett asked bluntly. \u201cIf you need a break from KGI, tell me. I can take over operations. The teams are getting restless. They need the action. So do we.\u201d</p><p>Even Donovan looked like he agreed with Garrett.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a goddamn funk. A lot of shit has gone down over the last year. We needed to be here with the family.\u201d</p><p>He could feel himself growing defensive, which meant they had a goddamn point, as much as he hated to admit it.</p><p>Both his brothers just stared at him, as if waiting for him to come to the conclusion on his own that he was being a dumbass.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, I get it,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll put your asses to work.\u201d</p><p>Sam sighed and rose from the patio chair to stretch his legs. He rested his palms on the railing of the deck, enjoying the sun-warmed wood against his skin.</p><p>Maybe it was time to get back on the job and work off his restlessness.</p><p>He glanced back at Garrett and studied the shadows under his eyes. Garrett didn\u2019t like time off. It gave him too much time to think about the shit that went down with his special-ops team just before he left the Marines. He hadn\u2019t been sleeping lately, not that he\u2019d admit it to either Sam or Donovan.</p><p>Van had confided to Sam that Garrett had been tracking down any and all information on Marcus Lattimer, the man responsible for Garrett\u2019s mission going to shit and Garrett\u2019s subsequent stay in the hospital to recover from a bullet to the thigh.</p><p>Sam had been meaning to bring it up with Garrett, but he hadn\u2019t found the right time. Not that any time was ever good to try to pin Garrett down and make him talk.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you staring at?\u201d Garrett asked rudely.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell,\u201d Sam said bluntly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been sleeping again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well that\u2019s two of us. At least I\u2019m not hung up on some chick. Quit trying to avoid the subject by making this about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind anything yet?\u201d Sam asked mildly.</p><p>Garrett frowned and looked for a moment like he\u2019d pretend he didn\u2019t know what Sam was talking about. He slapped a burger on the grill, banging the spatula in the process. Then he glanced over at Donovan.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me,\u201d Donovan said, holding up his hands. \u201cYou haven\u2019t exactly been discreet about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to take the fucker down,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>Sam leaned back and braced his hands behind him on the railing. \u201cChrist, Garrett. KGI can\u2019t afford to go on some damn revenge mission.\u201d</p><p>Garrett shrugged. \u201cWho says it has to be about revenge? The world would be a better place without the piece of shit. He\u2019s dirty. He\u2019s a traitor.\u201d He stared hard at Sam. \u201cHe cost me my team. While we sit here waiting for you to snap out of your funk, we could be doing something useful. Like nailing Lattimer\u2019s sorry ass to the wall.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a whole lot Sam could say to that. He understood Garrett\u2019s rage. He\u2019d be doing the same in Garrett\u2019s shoes. But he sure as hell hoped his brothers would rein him in. Just like he was doing with Garrett.</p><p>\u201cGarrett\u2019s not the problem right now,\u201d Donovan said pointedly. \u201cYou are. You need to pull your head out of your ass, and we need to go back to work, otherwise Garrett\u2019s going to go rogue on us and start some goddamn war trying to find Lattimer.\u201d</p><p>Sam blew out his breath and turned around to gaze out over the lake once more. His brothers were right. His head wasn\u2019t in it, and that was a very bad thing for KGI. They\u2019d built their business into an extensive list of military and government contacts. They did jobs for agencies that didn\u2019t even exist.</p><p>The job to take out Mouton had come from their CIA contact, Resnick, and while KGI had thwarted one arms deal, Mouton himself had slipped through their fingers. Which meant he was still there, still viable, and he was busy rebuilding his network.</p><p>And at least for now, the U.S. government didn\u2019t seem inclined to follow up.</p><p>Sam hated unfinished business. It went against his every principle to leave a predator out there who was capable of destroying so many lives. In theory it wasn\u2019t personal. Mouton was just a job, but to Sam it had become personal the moment he failed to take the man down.</p><p>He was tempted to tell his CIA contact to fuck off and go back after Mouton, but it wasn\u2019t worth getting on Uncle Sam\u2019s bad side.</p><p>His lips twisted into a grimace. Maybe Donovan had the right idea. Maybe some sun, sex and vacation would get his mind back in the game. And off Sophie.</p><p>He had started to turn around to his brothers again when he caught sight of something that gave him pause. A large log was floating lazily down the lake. Water levels were way up in the spring as the TVA held water in so as not to burden the rain-swollen rivers and creeks that the lake fed. Recent storms and heavy rainfall had caused a debris field that had only just begun to diminish. But it was something on the end of the log that captured Sam\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Sam?\u201d Garrett asked.</p><p>But Sam didn\u2019t answer him. He leaped over the edge of the deck and took off running down the dock toward the water. He heard his brothers\u2019 surprised exclamations behind him, but he didn\u2019t slow down.</p><p>When he reached the end of the dock, he dove cleanly into the water, wincing at the cold shock. He surfaced several yards away and swam hard toward the middle of the channel.</p><p>He grasped the middle of the log and maneuvered his way down. A woman\u2019s limp body was draped across the end, her wet, bedraggled hair hiding her face completely.</p><p>He hesitated a moment, afraid to reach out and touch her, to feel the rigidity of death. Then he shook off the ridiculous fear and grasped her shoulder.</p><p>To his relief, her skin was soft and pliable, albeit cold, under his fingers.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what the fuck?\u201d</p><p>Sam jerked around to see Garrett approaching with swift, sure strokes.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get her to shore,\u201d Sam said as he pulled her from the log.</p><p>Her head lolled to the side, and he sheltered her face in his neck so she wouldn\u2019t accidentally inhale any water. He put fingers to her neck to check for a pulse. Weak and thready, but it was there.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck, she\u2019s been shot,\u201d Garrett said as he closed in on her other side.</p><p>Sam glanced down to see her blood-smeared arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said grimly as he turned on his side and began doing a sidestroke back toward shore.</p><p>Garrett kept pace, holding as much of her body out of the water as he could. As they neared the shore, Donovan waded out and reached for the woman.</p><p>Sam waved him off and curled his arms underneath her, lifting her from the water as he stood in the shallow depths. It was ridiculous, but he was gripped by the necessity to see to her himself. He didn\u2019t want anyone else touching her.</p><p>His nape prickled and the hairs stood up as he laid her on the ground. The first thing he noticed was the bruises around her slim neck. Someone had done their damndest to choke her.</p><p>The second thing he saw was the obvious bullet wound in her arm. Blood still seeped from the jagged crease.</p><p>The third thing? His gaze drifted down her body, and he froze as he met with the tiny swollen mound of her belly.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d he breathed. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call an ambulance,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>The woman stirred at Garrett\u2019s voice, and Sam reached up to wipe the hair from her eyes.</p><p>All the breath left his body as her eyelids fluttered open and their eyes met. He took stock\u2014took full stock of her face\u2014and the realization hit him like a sledgehammer.</p><p>God, he couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around it. He was leaning over her, staring down at her; his mind registered who she was, but it didn\u2019t make sense to him.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he rasped out.</p><p>Her eyes widened in recognition just as fear slammed hard into those big blue eyes of hers.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>It came out a hoarse whisper and dissolved into a cough. Once she started, she couldn\u2019t stop, and her entire body convulsed as she coughed water from her lungs. Her moan of pain hit him hard in the chest and jolted him out of his fog.</p><p>And then the next wave of what-the-fuck hit him so hard he nearly lost his balance.</p><p>Sophie was pregnant.</p><p>He and Sophie had been together just five months ago.</p><p>She certainly didn\u2019t look beyond five months pregnant.</p><p>In fact she looked exactly that far along. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was hurt. Someone had shot her. Someone had tried to kill her.</p><p>She was pregnant.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cNo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo ambulance. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his arm with surprising strength. Her eyes were wild, and he doubted she had a clue where she was, who she was or the danger both she and her child were in.</p><p>\u201cYou need a hospital,\u201d he soothed. Hell, he needed a hospital. Or a stiff drink. What the hell was she doing here? Where the hell had she been for the last five months?</p><p>Pregnant. Sweet Jesus, was the baby his? His tongue felt thick and swollen in his mouth. He couldn\u2019t form the words, and he doubted she\u2019d understand them anyway.</p><p>His hand automatically went to her arm, where the wound had started to bleed again. Her blood was warm against her cold skin, and he pressed as hard as he dared, not wanting to hurt her more.</p> <p>She raised her head, and her eyes, glazed with pain, sparked with determination.</p><p>\u201cNo hospital. No police. Promise me. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>The desperation in her voice got to him. An uneasy sensation crawled down his spine. His gut told him this was a clusterfuck beyond all clusterfucks.</p><p>He glanced up at Garrett, who was staring at him and Sophie with a deep scowl of concentration. No doubt he wanted to know what the hell was going on. That made two of them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call the ambulance,\u201d Sam said and turned to look up at Donovan, his hand still clamped over the bullet wound. \u201cGet inside, find bandages, a med kit, anything you can dig up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your goddamn mind?\u201d Garrett exploded. \u201cShe\u2019s been hurt. She\u2019s been shot. And she\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>Sam swallowed and looked down at Sophie\u2019s eyes that were now closed.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, please do as I asked. I know this woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is she?\u201d</p><p>He stared both his brothers down. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>COLD. She was freezing. And she was having hallucinations. Sam. She\u2019d seen Sam. But he wasn\u2019t here. She didn\u2019t know where he was. Only that there was a man who looked an awful lot like him standing over her with an expression of horror on his face. Sam wouldn\u2019t be that horrified to see her, would he? He didn\u2019t know the truth. Yet. No, it definitely wasn\u2019t Sam.</p><p>Then a warm blanket surrounded her, and strong arms lifted her up. She settled against a hard chest, those arms still tight around her.</p><p>Sophie opened her eyes and glanced up to see a hard jawline. Strong. Firm. With just a hint of stubble, as though he\u2019d been too lazy to shave that morning. It was damn sexy.</p> <p>Her gaze wandered upward, and then his head moved and his eyes met hers. Blue. Pale blue, like ice. Just like Sam\u2019s eyes. Was she still dreaming? If she was, she wanted to just go along with it. It was a nice dream.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Back? Where the hell had she been? Her brow crinkled in confusion. \u201cHave I been here before?\u201d she asked. For that matter how had she gotten here? Everything was so fuzzy. She felt funny. Not herself at all. She was having a hard time remembering the smallest of details. It frustrated her because there was something important she had to do.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said I was back, as if I\u2019d been here before.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a worried look and picked up his pace. \u201cI meant that you were back. Conscious. You regained consciousness briefly when I pulled you out of the water, but then you passed out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>His concern deepened and he glanced over, and it was then that Sophie saw another man striding beside them. Big. Mean-looking. He was scowling at her.</p><p>Sophie shrunk against the man carrying her and gave an involuntary shiver.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he murmured soothingly as he hoisted her higher in his arms. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Again he glanced sideways. \u201cThat\u2019s Garrett. He\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s big and mean-looking,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He shook against her as he laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s harmless.\u201d</p><p>A snort sounded, and Sophie guessed that Garrett didn\u2019t appreciate his brother\u2019s assessment.</p><p>Then Garrett leaned over to stare at her. \u201cThe question is, who are you?\u201d</p><p>She shrank back and would have crawled over her protector\u2019s shoulder and hidden behind him if she could have.</p><p>\u201cBack off, Garrett, you\u2019re scaring her.\u201d</p><p>Garrett scowled again and gave her a look that suggested he wasn\u2019t finished. Anger surged over Sophie. Damn it, she\u2019d had enough of overbearing, asshole males.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d the man carrying her soothed, as though he sensed her tension.</p><p>He mounted steps and then carried her past another man\u2014just what the hell kind of mess had she landed herself in now? At least they weren\u2019t carrying guns, and so far they hadn\u2019t tried to kill her. That was a plus, wasn\u2019t it? Maybe they could tell her how to find Sam.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d she asked faintly as he settled her onto a bed. Not waiting on a response, she curled into a ball and reached for the covers and a pillow simultaneously. God, she was tired. She hurt from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d a male voice reproached. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to sleep yet.\u201d</p><p>She shoved at him with a hand and snuggled deeper into the pillow. It felt good. Her muscles started to relax into the warm covers, and then they started screaming in protest.</p><p>Her mouth and eyes flew open as pain overwhelmed her. Her arm. Fire. The numb had worn off. And then she remembered. Going overboard. Getting shot. Escaping.</p><p>Her hand climbed up her arm, feeling for the wound. It couldn\u2019t be too bad, could it?</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d the Sam look-alike murmured. \u201cI\u2019d say some of the shock has worn off and now you\u2019re starting to feel it.\u201d</p><p>She shook violently, her fingers still gripping the area of the gunshot. A gentle hand grasped her fingers and pried them away from her wound.</p><p>\u201cH-hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You should be in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Her head flew up. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the bandages,\u201d Garrett said as he strode into the room. \u201cVan\u2019s bringing some water and washcloths so you can clean the wound.\u201d</p><p>Sophie clutched the covers to her chest and stared cautiously at Garrett.</p><p>Garrett didn\u2019t look any more impressed with her than she did him. He regarded her with what she could only describe as deep suspicion.</p><p>A moment later, the third man crowded in behind Garrett. He at least didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d like for her to be anywhere but here, but caution radiated from him nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cThis is my brother Donovan,\u201d fake Sam said as he jerked a thumb over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHow many brothers do you have?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cFive. Only two are here, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s three more?\u201d she asked, trying to keep the horror from her voice.</p><p>The room spun crazily around her, and she was so cold that her teeth were going to break from chattering. There was something important she had to do, but she couldn\u2019t remember anything beyond keeping her baby safe.</p><p>She clutched her belly when she realized she still hadn\u2019t felt her baby move. Tears scalded her cheeks, and she sniffed loudly, but she couldn\u2019t manage to get air through her nose.</p><p>Through the haze and confusion she remembered the one thing she had to do above all else.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d she croaked out. \u201cI have to get to Sam. They\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>She sank lower in the bed as the room dimmed around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d No, it was that guy who looked like him. She shook her head. \u201cNo, Sam K-kelly. Have to get to, Sam. Important. They\u2019ll kill me too. My baby.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth clanked together until her jaw ached.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she pull herself together? Why did she feel so disjointed and murky? The room spun crazily around her, like she was stuck on some Ferris wheel from hell. Her stomach knotted and boiled. The god-awful pain was making her nauseous, and the last thing she wanted to do was puke.</p><p>Nothing made sense. She\u2019d heard herself babble on, but she couldn\u2019t even remember about what.</p><p>Sam. That came back to her. It was her one constant.</p><p>She tried to say his name again, but found her lips stiff and uncooperative. Her lashes drifted over her eyes, and she tried to rub at them so she could see.</p><p>Darkness crowded in until the room was so dim she couldn\u2019t even make out the men. It hurt to fight the growing dark. And so she gave up.</p><p>Sam watched as she drifted into unconsciousness again. He glanced up at Garrett and Donovan to see them both staring holes through him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the ever loving hell?\u201d Garrett finally said.</p><p>Sam dragged a hand through his hair and cupped the back of his neck. \u201cChrist, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Donovan demanded.</p><p>Before he could answer, Garrett\u2019s eyes narrowed and he stared between Sophie and Sam.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the chick you were involved with in Mexico isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Sam ignored Garrett and raised the covers higher over Sophie so she\u2019d be warmer, but he was careful to leave her arm uncovered. The blood still seeping from the wound disturbed him. Hell, the whole thing disturbed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did she mean by needing to warn you?\u201d Donovan asked. \u201cThis stinks to high heaven, Sam. You should call Sean and an ambulance. Let him handle things.\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re not calling the police. Not until I know what the hell went on here.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to her belly. He pushed aside the covers more, and he couldn\u2019t help but slide his palm over the swell. Her skin was cold to touch, but the hard little ball of her stomach fascinated him.</p><p>\u201cOh hell,\u201d Garrett muttered. \u201cOh hell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Donovan demanded.</p><p>Sam knew. He swallowed and looked up at his brothers. \u201cIt could be mine. I won\u2019t know until I can talk to her, but we were together five months ago. She sure looks like she\u2019s about five months along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Donovan blew out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Van. This stinks like a roadkill skunk,\u201d Garrett said grimly.</p><p>Sam gestured toward Sophie. \u201cI need to bandage her while she\u2019s unconscious. I need you to help me with her arm. If the bullet\u2019s still in there, we aren\u2019t going to have a choice but to get her to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the wound. Bullet or no bullet, it needed stitches. He didn\u2019t know how the hell he could keep her out of the hospital or why the hell he should.</p><p>Donovan eased onto the bed on the other side of Sophie, his expression grim.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like someone beat the hell out of her, tried to choke her, and then shot her. Not necessarily in that order.\u201d</p><p>Anger tightened Sam\u2019s jaw. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what it looks like. It\u2019s a wonder she got away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she got away,\u201d Garrett said sourly.</p><p>Sam shot him an irritated look. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it pretty damn strange that she shows up half-drowned and beat up, with a bullet wound, and talking some shit like she has to warn you. Where the hell has she been for five months if you were so hot and heavy with her? She had to know you could protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you saying?\u201d Sam asked calmly. \u201cYou think she beat herself up, shot herself, then threw herself in the lake when she\u2019s pregnant as an elaborate scheme to get to me?\u201d</p><p>Garrett had the grace to look a little abashed.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you\u2019re a suspicious bastard. I\u2019m having my share of what-the-fuckitus at the moment myself, but until I hear what she has to say, I\u2019m reserving judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call,\u201d Donovan murmured as he examined Sophie\u2019s wound. \u201cLooks like a through-and-through. No bone. Flesh wound. It\u2019ll hurt like hell and will probably get infected after she spent so much time in the lake, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too serious. I\u2019d be more worried about her pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Donovan\u2019s statement hit Sam like a hammer. Yeah, he\u2019d seen her belly. He\u2019d even calmly and matter-of-factly told his brothers that the baby could be his. But not until now had he really let it sink in.</p><p>There was a baby. It might be his. He might be a father.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Talk about coming from left field. This wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d contemplated in his wildest dreams. He\u2019d left it to his brothers to settle down and have babies. He figured Ethan and Rachel would pop out a couple before he would ever consider settling down and providing grand-children for Mom and Dad.</p><p>He winced. Holy hell. Ma would shit a brick over this.</p><p>He was thirty-six. Well past the age most men thought about having families, wasn\u2019t it? But he damn sure assumed that if and when he got around to doing it, it would be on his terms, preferably with a woman he\u2019d married and after thoughtful consideration. Babies and his career didn\u2019t exactly mix. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou okay, man?\u201d Donovan asked softly.</p><p>Was he okay? He felt like someone had yanked the rug out from under him. Like someone had suddenly changed all the rules and altered the entire course of his life.</p><p>Okay, so it sounded dramatic, but hell, it was! A baby changed everything. And then there was Sophie. Why had she disappeared? No, he hadn\u2019t given her any promises. He hadn\u2019t been in a position to offer her anything at all. Not even his true identity . . .</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he bit out.</p> <p>Garrett glanced sharply at him.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did she know where to find me? She knew me as Sam. Just Sam. Some guy coming through the bar where she worked. Not Sam Kelly. I could have been from anywhere for all she knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you probably indulged in some heavy pillow talk,\u201d Garrett said dryly.</p><p>Sam shook his head. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid? Besides, talking wasn\u2019t exactly what we were doing when we were alone.\u201d</p><p>Donovan snickered but then quickly sobered. \u201cSo what the hell do we do? It\u2019s a little too coincidental that the chick you have a fling with, while undercover, just happens to show up looking like death warmed over muttering dire warnings about people trying to kill you\u2014when in fact she wasn\u2019t supposed to know anything about you. And certainly not where you lived.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat about covers it,\u201d Sam said as he stared down at Sophie\u2019s still form.</p><p>The sheet over her belly bumped. Just a little twitch that he almost missed. Perplexed, he leaned over and drew away the sheet. Her soaked shirt had ridden up, exposing the smooth expanse of her stomach.</p><p>He remembered touching her, running his hands over her lush body, though it had certainly changed since they\u2019d last made love.</p><p>He put his hand to the side of her belly, only to feel the tiny little bump against his palm. In awe he stared. It was the baby.</p><p>\u201cGuess the little critter is okay,\u201d Garrett mumbled.</p><p>Sam couldn\u2019t form a response. He was too befuddled. Was this his child he was feeling against his fingers?</p> <p>\u201cYou should get her out of those wet clothes,\u201d Donovan offered. \u201cYou and Garrett both need to get into dry clothes. I\u2019ll go warm up some soup and find out if we have antibiotics in our stash of medications. She\u2019ll need that and something stronger than ibuprofen for pain. Not to mention I\u2019m not sure what she can take being pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Sam stirred and shook himself from his trance. Then he scowled. No one but him was going to see her naked. He focused his frown on Garrett until Garrett finally got the message and walked toward the door, muttering under his breath the entire way.</p><p>\u201cGet the soup and find what medications you can,\u201d Sam said to Donovan. \u201cAfter I get her out of these clothes and into something warm, I\u2019ll assess her injuries. When she wakes up and can tell us what the hell is going on and why she doesn\u2019t want us to take her to the hospital, we\u2019ll figure out what to do next.\u201d</p><p>Donovan nodded and headed out of the room after Garrett.</p><p>Sam turned his attention back to the woman lying in his bed. His woman. His child?</p><p>He shook his head in denial She wasn\u2019t his.</p><p>He fingered a strand of wet hair, pulling it carefully away from her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been, Sophie?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cWhat secrets are you hiding and who the hell wants you dead?\u201d</p> <p>Sudden rage rolled through his body. Whoever wanted her dead had also tried to kill his child. His child.</p><p>So many questions buzzed around his head he was about to go crazy. If he didn\u2019t take care of her, she wouldn\u2019t survive to give him any answers. She still shivered, even in her unconscious state. He needed to get her out of her wet clothes and he needed to get her warm.</p><p>He shucked out of his clothing and wasted no time getting something dry on. Then he returned to Sophie.</p><p>Carefully, he peeled the soaked layers from her body, paying special care to her injuries. A variety of bruises dotted her body, and his jaw tightened as he studied the dark fingerprints at her neck.</p><p>Her nipples puckered and stood erect as chill bumps chased down her body. Her body was slim and curvy except for the mound of her belly. Sam stared unabashedly at her nude form, mesmerized by the changes her pregnancy had wrought.</p><p>She seemed too small and too thin. She\u2019d been a little bit of a thing to begin with, but shouldn\u2019t pregnancy fill a woman out? Make her more curvy? He\u2019d certainly heard his mom complain about gaining a cup size with each of her pregnancies and how her hips had expanded exponentially. Other than her nipples being darker, the only change in Sophie was the bump riding low on her belly.</p><p>\u201cIs it mine, Sophie?\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d</p><p>He carefully slipped one of his flannel shirts around her and buttoned it up over the bandages Donovan had secured to her wound. He worried over the blood that had seeped through the gauze. Any blood loss couldn\u2019t be good for a pregnant woman, no matter how slight the wound was. And then there was the fact she\u2019d obviously been in the lake for a while. Her skin was still cold to the touch and her lips had a bluish tinge that he didn\u2019t like at all.</p><p>So many questions. The smart thing would be to call Sean and get Sophie to the hospital. She was hurt and she was pregnant. But every time he looked toward the phone, he remembered the fear in her eyes and the conviction of her words.</p><p>She certainly wasn\u2019t lying about a threat. Whether it was to her, him or both of them, he couldn\u2019t afford to take chances with her life\u2014and her child\u2019s.</p><p>He crawled onto the bed, piling more covers over her cold body. He lay on his side and pulled her carefully against him, giving her the benefit of his body heat. Then he pulled the covers tight around them, sealing in the warmth.</p><p>Gradually she stopped shivering and seemed to settle. Her lips parted against his chest, and a breathy sigh escaped. She tried to nestle closer but whimpered when her shoulder bumped against his body.</p><p>\u201cCareful, honey,\u201d he whispered and pulled her hand down to wedge between their bodies so he could render her immobile.</p><p>\u201cC-cold,\u201d she murmured restlessly against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019ll get warm. Just lie still so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-sam? Is that really you or am I still dreaming?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of her confusion. Shock and cold\u2014not to mention a bullet wound\u2014could make a person pretty damned \u201coff.\u201d Suspicion crept into his mind even as he wanted to discount it all as some bizarre coincidence.</p><p>Only an idiot ignored the obvious. Coincidence, my ass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Sophie. I\u2019m here. You\u2019ve been hurt. I need to get you to a hospital. You need to make sure your baby is okay.\u201d</p><p>It took everything he had not to interrogate her then and there. Only the knowledge of how very fragile she was restrained him.</p><p>She shook her head against him, then moaned low in her throat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. It\u2019ll only hurt worse,\u201d he cautioned.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t go to hospital,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cHe\u2019ll find me.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s brow crinkled and he stared down at her face pressed so firmly against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWho, Sophie? Who\u2019ll find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s\u2014his men,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>As what-the-fuck statements went, that was a doozy. Sam stared down as her eyelids fluttered shut once more. He wanted to beat his head in frustration, and then he immediately felt guilty when he remembered that the woman in his arms had obviously had a pretty shitty day\u2014or week for that matter.</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d He waited for a response. \u201cSophie,\u201d he said a little louder. \u201cHoney, wake up. I need you to talk to me here.\u201d</p><p>She moaned and dug her face into his chest, a gesture that told him more than words that she wanted him to shut up and go away.</p><p>This was making him crazy. Van would be back any second with medicine and whatever else he\u2019d managed to dig up. Going with that thought, Sam checked the covers to make sure she was shielded from any prying eyes. Not that Van was an asshole, but hello, a half-naked woman would draw any red-blooded man\u2019s eyes. Wouldn\u2019t matter if she was dead.</p><p>He sighed when she went limp again. Goddamn it. This was not his day, his week or even his month. Had he really been thinking just an hour ago that he missed her? It was almost as if he\u2019d conjured her up, and while he\u2019d had plenty of fantasies about her being in his bed again, this damn sure wasn\u2019t what he had in mind.</p><p>Donovan knocked once, then without waiting for an answer, stuck his head through the door. Seeing Sam and Sophie, he came on in, a med kit in one hand and a syringe with a capped needle in the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Sam demanded when Donovan came closer to the bed.</p><p>\u201cAntibiotics. Got it out of the field kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s safe to give it to a pregnant woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Internet is a useful thing,\u201d Donovan said calmly. \u201cAmazing what you can find. I don\u2019t even know why people go to doctors anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to trust my child\u2019s safety to some web-site you Googled?\u201d Sam asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. You got a better idea? I still vote we call Sean and get her the hell to the hospital. And you know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>Sam sighed, then gestured for Donovan to come closer with the stuff. He also carried an assortment of bandages and ointments along with a suture kit.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, I\u2019m not letting you stitch her up. That\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is letting her arm rot off from infection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Van. You\u2019re the most infuriating son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>At that Donovan cracked a slight smile. \u201cYou and Garrett are so easy, I swear. I think you were both born with corncobs up your ass. I was trained as a medic, remember? I can do all sorts of amazing things. Fly airplanes and choppers, and I can sew limbs back on. They might rot off later, but hey that\u2019s not my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrreverent bastard,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent too much time around Joe.\u201d</p><p>Donovan grinned again. \u201cJoe always was my favorite sibling.\u201d</p><p>Sam waved impatiently at him. \u201cGive her the shot, but I want to take a look at her arm and side again before I turn you loose with a needle and thread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like I\u2019m about to embroider a pillowcase,\u201d Donovan said dryly.</p><p>Donovan uncapped the syringe and moved to the opposite side of the bed. He looked apologetically at Sam as he moved the covers aside to bare the curve of Sophie\u2019s hip. Sam scowled, but he held his tongue while Donovan efficiently swabbed the smooth skin above her buttocks and then plunged the needle into her flesh.</p><p>She flinched and let out a startled cry. She curled her hands into Sam\u2019s shirt and trembled, but her eyes didn\u2019t reopen. Sam instinctively pulled her closer, murmuring soothing words in her ear. But he glared his displeasure at his brother as he withdrew the needle and recapped the syringe.</p><p>Donovan rolled his eyes and moved onto the bed with one knee to begin to peel back the collar of the flannel shirt she wore. When he got to the bandage on her upper arm, he carefully pulled at it. The padding came away bright red, and Donovan frowned as he wiped at the fresh blood oozing from the wound.</p><p>\u201cShe needs stitches, Sam. I know you don\u2019t like it, but if you\u2019re not going to do the right thing and take her to the hospital, I need to stitch her up. I can give her a local to numb it. It won\u2019t be as good as the stuff they give you in the ER, but if she stays under, she won\u2019t feel it.\u201d</p><p>Sam swore under his breath, closed his eyes and blew out a sound of resignation. \u201cOkay, do it. Be quick about it. I don\u2019t want to make this worse than we have to.\u201d</p><p>Sam tucked her face into his neck, then smoothed his hand up her arm until he reached the spot Donovan was prepping. It was ridiculous that he was acting like a nervous woman over this. He\u2019d patched up his share of bloody wounds on the battlefield. He\u2019d seen things that would make even the most hardened soldier blanch. But the sight of Sophie, pregnant and vulnerable in his arms, while his brother was about to stick a needle through her skin, made his insides churn.</p><p>\u201cHold her,\u201d Donovan murmured as he prepared to place the first stitch. \u201cIf she jerks, it\u2019ll make it hurt more, and I don\u2019t want to do any more damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d Sam growled.</p><p>He curled Sophie tighter into him, offering her his strength and his protection. When the needle pierced her skin, he wasn\u2019t sure who tensed more\u2014him or Sophie.</p><p>Her face twisted and her eyes flew open in alarm. She seemed to look right through him. Her mouth opened in a soundless cry, and then when she spoke, it came out broken and hoarse.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt my baby.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s gut twisted, and even Donovan looked up, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Donovan muttered.</p><p>\u201cGet it over with,\u201d Sam ordered.</p><p>He turned back to Sophie and pressed his lips to hers in an effort to stop the whimpering sounds that hit him like darts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShhh, Sophie, it\u2019s Sam. I\u2019m here. Nothing\u2019s going to hurt you. I swear. Your baby is fine. I\u2019m fine. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d she slurred out. \u201cHave to warn Sam. No longer safe. I stayed away but now they found me. Sam has to know.\u201d</p><p>A single tear trailed down her cheek, and Sam kissed it away, savoring the contact after so many months. He didn\u2019t care what Van thought. Didn\u2019t care what he saw or that he\u2019d tell Garrett and they\u2019d both be on his ass. Right now this was his woman in his arms. His child. And he wanted to know who the hell had threatened her. Who she was so afraid of. And why she thought she had to protect him.</p><p>It made him furious.</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you finished yet?\u201d Sam hissed.</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d Donovan muttered.</p><p>Donovan set the needle to her flesh to do the last two stitches. Sam just prayed he\u2019d hurry the fuck up.</p><p>Again Sophie tensed and let out a low sob. Sam wanted to moan with her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be so angry,\u201d she said in a broken voice.</p> <p>She was babbling now, flinching with each stitch, though she didn\u2019t struggle. She seemed to have resigned herself to the hell she was enduring. Sam only wished he knew what was going on inside her fevered mind.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll hate me. He\u2019ll never understand. Have to tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>Donovan tied off the last suture and cast a worried glance in Sam\u2019s direction. Sam didn\u2019t need Donovan to tell him this was crazy. It went beyond bizarre. There was some seriously weird shit going on.</p><p>The question was, how was Sophie involved? And if she was in trouble, why the hell hadn\u2019t she come to him before now?</p><p>His hand slid down to palm her belly, and he felt the reassuring little wiggle of the baby inside her womb.</p><p>And if this was his child, what the hell did that mean for him and Sophie now?</p> <p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>SOPHIE was finally warm. There wasn\u2019t a part of her body that didn\u2019t hurt, but she was warm. It took her a moment in her befuddlement to realize that the source of her warmth came from another person.</p><p>She studied the feel of the body against hers without opening her eyes. Hard. Muscled. Definitely male. And familiar.</p><p>She snuggled deeper into the wall of his chest and inhaled deeply. She knew that scent. She\u2019d know it anywhere.</p><p>Sam.</p><p>His arm tightened around her waist, forcing her belly into his groin. It was then she felt the light flutter of her baby. Gasping, she bolted upright, nearly screaming in agony when her arm protested. But she didn\u2019t care. Her baby had moved.</p><p>She sat up in the bed, both her hands splayed over her belly, as she willed her little one to move again. She nearly came undone when the reassuring pitter-patter tapped a rhythm against her palms.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Relief staggered her and made her weak. She sagged precariously, and strong arms caught her, easing her back down on the pillow. She stared up into Sam\u2019s blue eyes, and she forgot to breathe.</p><p>She reached up to touch his cheek, needing proof that he was really here. \u201cSam. It\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d made it. She didn\u2019t know how. She didn\u2019t care. But she was here and safe with Sam. He\u2019d protect her and their child. He had to.</p><p>He studied her intently. His expression was guarded, and his lips were in a firm line, neither smiling nor frowning.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me, Sophie. How are you feeling? Are you in a lot of pain?\u201d</p><p>She was too shocked to register how she felt. She was so relieved that her baby was moving, but she was flabbergasted that she was lying in Sam\u2019s bed, in his arms. How many nights had she lain alone, dreaming of being back in his arms?</p><p>Then fear rolled through her. The rush of memories, everything that had happened in the last few days, came at her, reminding her that her child\u2019s life wasn\u2019t worth a damn at the moment.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d she asked as she struggled to remove herself from Sam\u2019s grip.</p><p>Pain shot up her arm and left her gasping for breath. He let her go but assisted her in sitting up. His gaze dropped to her belly, and she swallowed nervously. He wasn\u2019t stupid. He\u2019d put it together. He probably already had. But there was so much more he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cA few hours,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cI fished you out of the lake. You\u2019ve drifted in and out of consciousness ever since. You freaked when I told my brother to call for an ambulance. You specifically didn\u2019t want a hospital or the police. Care to tell me why?\u201d</p><p>She glanced away, but he nudged her chin back with insistent fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh no, Sophie. You and I have a lot to talk about. Starting with what the hell happened to you. Where the hell you disappeared to five months ago. How you knew where to find me and who I was. Why you feel the need to warn me. And most importantly. The most important issue of all. Are you pregnant with my child?\u201d</p><p>The blood rushed from her face. He certainly hadn\u2019t pulled any punches. But then he deserved answers. He\u2019d hate her, but he deserved to know the truth. About everything.</p><p>She swallowed nervously and stared at him with dread weighing down on her like two tons of bricks.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and he brushed his thumb over her cheek. She should have found the gesture comforting, but it was more prompting than affectionate.</p><p>She licked her lips, then opened her mouth, but nothing came out. She stared at him in horror as hot tears rolled down her cheeks. Now that she was finally in front of him, was so close she could feel his warmth wrapping around her, she couldn\u2019t say anything at all.</p><p>His expression softened and his fingers eased around her jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me, Sophie. I won\u2019t ever hurt you. I\u2019m in uncharted territory here, so bear with me, okay? I need to know if you\u2019re carrying my child.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, his other hand dropped to her belly, and he cupped the rounded curve. The baby fluttered and bumped in response, and she caught her breath at the wonder of feeling her move after being still for so long.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s yours,\u201d Sophie said around a chest so tight she could barely breathe.</p><p>His pupils flared and his nostrils quivered. For a moment he stared at her in silence, as if digesting the declaration.</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d he finally said.</p><p>Sophie flushed. \u201cI call it \u2018her.\u2019 I don\u2019t know for sure. Just a feeling. I don\u2019t like saying \u2018it.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can tell at this stage, right? I mean, you\u2019ve had a sonogram. Couldn\u2019t they tell you the sex?\u201d</p><p>She looked down. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a sonogram.\u201d</p><p>He nudged her chin up again, and he frowned at her. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cToo dangerous.\u201d</p><p>His mouth screwed up into a pinched bow. He continued staring at her with those intense blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s yours. No doubt about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He seemed calm enough, but she could sense the turmoil beneath the deceptively calm expression.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just now getting around to telling me.\u201d</p><p>She almost laughed. She would have if she hadn\u2019t been so sure it would end up in a fit of hysteria. Tell him. As if it was the easiest thing in the world. Bitterness, sharp and quick, welled in her chest.</p><p>\u201cTell you?\u201d She did laugh then. She simply couldn\u2019t hold it back. As predicted, it ended in a high, shrill sound that was anything but pleasant. \u201cJust how was I supposed to tell you, Sam? You walked out of that hotel room after you told me I wouldn\u2019t see you again.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed again, and they glittered dangerously.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you had no problem finding me. You obviously knew where I was all along, which is more than I can say I knew about you. How is that, Sophie? Just who the hell are you and what are you playing at?\u201d</p><p>How quickly his questions turned into accusations.</p><p>She rolled, bracing herself for when her injured arm took the brunt of her weight. She struggled to get her feet over the edge of the bed and onto the floor. She stood, and the flannel shirt fell to her knees. Just as well since she was butt naked underneath.</p><p>She looked around for clothing, even as her mind rolled with just how to relate everything she needed to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make this quick and easy,\u201d she said in a bitter voice. \u201cSomeone wants me dead, or they will as soon as they get what they want from me. They probably want you dead too, but you\u2019ve been kept alive because you\u2019re the bait. I stayed away for that reason. But they got too close, and I couldn\u2019t take a chance on staying ahead of them any longer. I\u2019m certainly not as fast or as bright as I used to be.\u201d</p><p>She gestured down at her belly in disgust. \u201cNot only does pregnancy make me slower, but I swear it sucks all the brain cells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, you need to calm down,\u201d Sam said as he put his hands out in a placating manner. \u201cCome back and sit down. You shouldn\u2019t be up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are my clothes?\u201d she demanded as she looked around. \u201cI need my clothes.\u201d She knew she sounded desperate and irrational. But damn it, she needed something to wear, and she needed to get the hell out of here. Sam said she\u2019d been here several hours. Tomas and company would know exactly where to look for her.</p><p>Her gaze lighted on a pair of sweatpants in the corner, and she bent down to pick them up. When she stood back up, pain splintered down her arm, and she bobbled like a drunken party girl wearing stilettos. Sam was there to catch her, but she yanked herself away and edged toward the bed so she could pull the pants on.</p><p>They were way too big, but she didn\u2019t care. They were warm and dry. As soon as she got them on, she stood again and reached for Sam, tugging on his arm. He looked at her in disbelief, like he\u2019d look at a crazy woman.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sam. We have to go. We can\u2019t stay here. They\u2019ll come. They\u2019ll kill you. And your brothers. I didn\u2019t know you had brothers. Sorry. I didn\u2019t realize. I thought it was just you and your men.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse thudded painfully at her temples, and her chin wobbled as she chattered out the rest. She didn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever, and Sam just stood there staring at her like she\u2019d lost her mind.</p><p>She reached again and this time took his hand between hers. She pulled until his palm rested on her belly.</p><p>\u201cThey were going to kill her, Sam. He had a knife. He said he\u2019d slice me open and let her spill out. I can\u2019t let that happen. I need your help. Please. You have to help me.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared at her in horror, then his gaze dropped to where his hand was splayed across her abdomen. He looked so appalled that she stopped for a moment and wrapped her arms around her stomach, trapping his hand there.</p><p>\u201cSweet mother of God,\u201d Sam muttered. He pulled his hand away and then yanked her into his arms.</p><p>It hurt like hell, but she didn\u2019t care. She didn\u2019t protest and she didn\u2019t try to pull away. She wanted to absorb him right into her soul. Finally she felt safe. Like maybe she wasn\u2019t so alone.</p><p>For just a moment she stood there, but reality crept in despite her wanting to indulge in the fantasy.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She pulled away, but he held her firm.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she protested. \u201cWe have to get out of here, Sam. Your brothers. They have to go too. They\u2019ll kill them.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her good arm, and with his other hand he gripped her chin and held her so that she was forced to stare back at him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a few things straight here, okay? One, you\u2019re not going anywhere. Period. Two, I need answers, Sophie. A lot of damn answers. Three, no one is going to hurt you or my child. Four, if you knew where I\u2019ve been all this time, you damn well should have come to me the moment you knew you were in danger.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in disbelief. Then she laughed. It was all she could do. He was so determined, and how like a man to try and simplify matters.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, Sam. I can\u2019t stay. I won\u2019t put my baby in danger,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI barely managed to escape the bastard last night. He shot me. He would have killed my baby. I\u2019m not giving him a second chance. I\u2019ve stayed ahead of him for the last five months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now he\u2019s caught up to you,\u201d Sam said calmly. \u201cSit down, Sophie. You and I have a hell of a lot to talk about. I want to get the personal stuff out of the way first. Because then I want my brothers here when you tell me all this other shit.\u201d</p><p>The fight left her and the pain overwhelmed her senses. She sagged onto the edge of the bed and dropped her head in defeat.</p><p>Sam knelt in front of her and carefully placed his hand on her belly.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t act like a man who wanted to know. You lied to me about everything from the moment we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you know everything about me. How is that, Sophie?\u201d he asked in a dangerously low voice.</p><p>She stared stubbornly back at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI came back for you,\u201d he said, surprising the hell out of her.</p><p>She furrowed her brow and frowned hard at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair and looked briefly away. \u201cI was there undercover. I couldn\u2019t tell you things, Sophie. I couldn\u2019t share anything more of myself than I did. But when it was over, I came back, but you were gone. Disappeared. I searched, and it was as if you didn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks warmed under his scrutiny, but she refused to feel guilty. She hadn\u2019t had a choice but to run and run hard. She\u2019d spent the last five months hiding. All because she\u2019d helped him. And betrayed her father in the process.</p> <p>\u201cLook at me and tell me she\u2019s mine,\u201d Sam said fiercely. \u201cI have to know. Don\u2019t jerk me around about this.\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze until she stared levelly at him. She let calm invade her because she had nothing to hide when it came to this. Oh, she had plenty of secrets, but in this, her conscience was clear.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s yours. There\u2019s been no one else, Sam. Not for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Was that relief she saw in his eyes? Regret? Joy? Maybe a mix of all three? It was hard to tell.</p><p>For just a moment, his focus shifted to her belly. He spread the material of the shirt tight over her stomach and he slid his fingers over every inch, studying the curve and the shallow indention of her belly button.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t wrap my brain around it,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a father.\u201d</p><p>She started to thrust her fingers into his hair but held back. There was so much unresolved between them. And maybe there was nothing to resolve. She had been a fling for him\u2014or so she\u2019d thought\u2014but he said he\u2019d come back for her. Did she dare believe him? A man would say a lot to get himself off the hook when his ass was to the fire.</p><p>But then he hadn\u2019t made her any promises, and she sure as hell had kept a lot from him. So many secrets. So much betrayal. It would be a lot easier to just warn him of the impending danger to him and his family and walk away.</p><p>As if sensing her sudden desire to flee, his hand tightened on her stomach and then he rose from his knees and took her hand in his.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk more about us later,\u201d he said in a quiet voice. \u201cRight now we need to talk about who the hell is trying to kill you and why you think me and my family are in danger. And we\u2019re not leaving my brothers out of this conversation, since they\u2019ll be the ones I\u2019ll be depending on to help save our asses.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p> <p>A myriad of emotions flickered across Sophie\u2019s face. Fear, indecision, pain and deep weariness. She should be in bed, resting, but she was as jumpy as a cricket, and she looked like she\u2019d flee if he looked away even a second.</p><p>Sam urged her back to bed. He plumped the pillows and mounded the covers up over her body until she sat like a queen presiding over her subjects. Only she looked small and frail instead of stately.</p><p>He held up a finger as he stared down at her. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Not even a muscle. I\u2019ll be back in a minute with my brothers.\u201d</p><p>The sudden wash of fear in her eyes made his gut clinch. Her hands went to her belly, and she rubbed in a tight circle. He wasn\u2019t sure who she was trying to reassure. Her baby or herself.</p><p>It was all he could do not to lean down and kiss her. To tell her it would be all right, that he\u2019d take care of her and their baby.</p><p>There was too much unsettled between them, and the uneasiness in his belly kept growing in direct proportion to the suspicion that had taken root in his mind.</p><p>When he was sure she wasn\u2019t going to bolt from the bed, he turned and strode to the door. He leaned out and didn\u2019t see Van or Garrett, but he could hear them in the kitchen. With a quick look back at Sophie and an unspoken directive for her to stay put, he hurried to get his brothers.</p><p>Donovan was stirring something in a mug while Garrett stood to the side, arms crossed over his broad chest, a typical scowl etched on his face.</p> <p>They both looked up when Sam walked in, and Donovan dropped the spoon on the counter.</p><p>\u201cI heated up some broth for her. Found some pain medication in our stash and did a cross-check for contraindications for pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cI need you both in the bedroom. Sophie\u2019s got some things to tell me that I want you to hear.\u201d</p><p>Garrett shoved off the wall and did nothing to disguise his interest.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. She says she\u2019s in danger\u2014that we\u2019re in danger. Since I depend on you two to cover my ass, and vice versa, I figured it would be helpful for you to hear whatever it is she has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she\u2019s full of shit?\u201d Garrett asked. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this whole thing scream setup to you? I\u2019d like to know how the fuck she knew where to find you. According to you she was a sweet-faced waitress with big eyes and you blew her off when we got the tip about Mouton\u2019s arms shipment moving out.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cYou\u2019re pissing me off right now, Garrett. You need to back the fuck off. You\u2019re not saying anything I\u2019m not thinking, but I\u2019m not going to go beat her down when she\u2019s hurt, scared and pregnant. She\u2019s a woman, for God\u2019s sake. Use your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of us has to,\u201d Garrett said evenly. \u201cThe right head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you again. Back off.\u201d</p><p>The two brothers stood nose to nose. Garrett\u2019s eyes glittered with anger and impatience, but Sam knew he just wanted answers. Well so did he. Hopefully he\u2019d use a little more finesse than Garrett.</p><p>Finally Garrett backed away.</p><p>Donovan cleared his throat. \u201cSo uh, are we going to be uncles?\u201d</p><p>The casual question made Sam flinch. Then he slowly nodded. \u201cYeah. The baby is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Garrett muttered.</p><p>\u201cHoo boy,\u201d Donovan said from pursed lips. He gathered the mound of supplies, then picked up the mug from the counter. \u201cNot sure what you want me to say, so I\u2019ll just shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sam snapped. \u201cShutting up is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sure she\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d Garrett said with a hint of anger in his voice.</p><p>Sam stopped on his way back to the bedroom and turned around. He eyed Garrett evenly. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not saying that at all. I am, however, embracing the very real possibility that the baby could be mine. She says it\u2019s mine. For now I\u2019m going with it. I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to my child.\u201d</p><p>Garrett rubbed his palm over his face and nodded. \u201cYeah, I understand, man. Van and I have your back. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and walked back into his bedroom. Sophie was listing badly to the right, her eyes half-closed. When she heard them come in, she jerked up and her eyes flew open. She winced and grabbed at her shoulder with her free hand.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Sam murmured as he went to her. He glanced back at Donovan. \u201cWill this pain medicine knock her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cFor the first little while she needs something stronger. Then we can knock it down to ibuprofen.\u201d</p><p>Sam grimaced, then turned apologetically to Sophie. \u201cWe need to talk. I\u2019ll have Donovan give you the medicine afterward. Then you can sleep for a good long while.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her eyes fierce. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep, Sam. After I tell you what you want to know, I have to go. I can\u2019t stay here. I\u2019ve already been here too long. If you won\u2019t go with me, I don\u2019t have a choice but to take off on my own.\u201d</p><p>He shot his brothers a pointed look but didn\u2019t respond to her statement. He sat down on the edge of the bed and motioned for his brothers to get comfortable.</p><p>Donovan edged onto the bed on the other side of Sophie and looked at her as if seeking permission. He might as well have not even been there for all the attention she paid him. Her face was pale and strained, and it was obvious she was fighting to stay conscious.</p><p>Garrett stood at the end of the bed, arms folded over his chest, and he stared broodingly at Sophie. When she happened to glance up at him, she went even paler.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Garrett,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cEase up for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Garrett shifted his position with an irritated huff.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Sophie. I need you to back up and tell me why you disappeared. Then I need to know how you knew who I was and where to find me and why people are trying to kill you and why you think me and my family are in danger.\u201d</p><p>She threw him an impatient look that suggested she didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that he was questioning what she\u2019d stated as fact.</p><p>Then she looked down at her hands, and he could see the tips go white as she nervously twisted her fingers. She took a deep breath and then glanced up at him, her eyes almost challenging. Like she was gearing up for battle.</p><p>\u201cMy father was Alex Mouton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>Sophie jumped at Garrett\u2019s explosion. Even Donovan recoiled and glared at Sophie. Sam processed the information with a sense of disbelief. He just stared at her, wondering just how badly he\u2019d been set up and fucked over.</p><p>She stared back at him, her lips pressed into a tight line as she waited for him to digest the bomb.</p><p>It was Donovan who finally prompted Sophie to continue. Sam wasn\u2019t able to speak. He was too furious. He felt like the biggest goddamn fool on the planet.</p><p>\u201cOkay so Mouton is your father,\u201d Donovan said in a tight voice. \u201cWait a minute. You said was.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew distant, and she looked at them as if measuring whether she trusted them enough to say anything.</p><p>\u201cJust a figure of speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sent you to me, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Sam asked before she could continue.</p><p>Her chin went up and her gaze hardened. \u201cHe did. You hit his radar the moment you came into his town. He wanted information.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cPity you failed. Or maybe you weren\u2019t good enough to get me to talk.\u201d</p><p>She winced and looked away. He felt like a bastard kicking a puppy, but goddamn it, he was pissed.</p><p>\u201cHe got nothing from me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really need it. He was on to you shortly after you stepped into his territory, but he thought it was a good idea for me to stay close to you in case you dropped any information he\u2019d find valuable. How do you think I knew where to find you? Here, I mean. It\u2019s why you need to understand the danger that you and your family are in.\u201d</p><p>There was a whole lot more she wanted to say. Sam could tell. Her lips quivered, and he saw the flash of her teeth as she sank them into her bottom lip to squelch the flow of words. What the hell?</p><p>She\u2019d played him from the start. Her father was an arms dealer and currently occupied the number two spot on the U.S. government\u2019s most wanted list. She claimed to be pregnant with his child. Her father wanted something from her and was using Sam\u2019s child as leverage, not to mention Sam and all his family were now in danger. And she expected him to drop everything to protect her. From what?</p><p>Donovan shot Sam a look that clearly said shut the fuck up. Was it that obvious he was ready to explode?</p><p>\u201cWe need clear heads here,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI get that you two have history, but right now, that\u2019s not as important as why someone\u2019s trying to kill Sophie. Why is that, Sophie?\u201d He stared hard at her, but his expression wasn\u2019t as fierce as Garrett\u2019s or what Sam knew his own must be. \u201cYou\u2019re not telling us everything.\u201d</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t. Sam could see the shadows in her eyes. She was holding back out of fear, but of whom? Was she afraid of him and his reaction? Or was she afraid of her father, and if so, what the hell had she done to make him turn on her after she\u2019d prostituted herself for him.</p><p>\u201cLook, you have to know my father was a bastard. It\u2019s not like he gave his flesh and blood a free pass. I saw my opportunity to escape, and I took it. There are people not so pleased with me because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we figure in where?\u201d Garrett demanded.</p><p>She threw him a disgusted look. \u201cYou encroached on Mouton territory. You fucked with the family business. You were a target as soon as you showed up looking to score a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was five months ago,\u201d Sam pointed out. \u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted. \u201cYou were bait. They were waiting for me to come to you. I stayed away as long as I could. But I\u2019m getting bigger and clumsier by the day. Soon I\u2019ll be completely defenseless. So I came here because I was sure you\u2019d at least protect your child.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked up and closed his eyes in frustration. \u201cSo you stayed away, kept the knowledge of my child from me even though you were both in danger, and you did this all to protect me.\u201d</p><p>Rage burst in her eyes like a flare. It was a sharp mixture of anger and grief and of helpless anxiety.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Fuck you.\u201d She looked to his brothers, including them in her fury. \u201cFuck you all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rolled to the side, shoving at Donovan as she slid to the floor. Her knees buckled, and she would have gone down in a heap if Donovan hadn\u2019t shot up to catch her.</p><p>Still, she shook him off and wrenched her arm from his grasp. A spasm of pain whitened her face, and her blue eyes went pale.</p><p>Sam moved across the room to cut off her escape route to the door. He made sure he took her uninjured arm, his other arm going around her waist to trap her against him.</p><p>She tried to shove him away, but he held tight.</p> <p>\u201cGet the shot ready,\u201d he ordered Donovan.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She struggled harder until he feared she was going to hurt herself more. \u201cSam, you can\u2019t keep me here. They\u2019ll find me! Are you insane? I get that you don\u2019t care about me, but for God\u2019s sake, think about your child. Your baby!\u201d</p><p>He maneuvered her to the bed and wrestled her down until she was pinned to the mattress. Tears were trapped in her eyes, but none fell, probably held back by sheer determination not to let him see her bleed.</p><p>He grimly held her down, staring into her tormented eyes.</p><p>\u201cRight now I don\u2019t give a damn about what you did in the past. Let\u2019s get that clear. You were a lay. A fling. You played me. Okay, fine. I can deal with that. But if that\u2019s my child\u2014if there\u2019s any chance that you\u2019re carrying my baby, you\u2019re not going anywhere. And I goddamn well protect what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p> <p>Hurt filled her eyes, and once again, he felt like he was crushing an innocent. Some innocent. Goddamn, she was Alex Mouton\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve to die, Sam. No matter what you think I did, I don\u2019t deserve to die.\u201d</p><p>His hands gentled on her shoulders as Donovan closed in with the syringe. Despite his anger and shock, Sam smoothed his fingers over her cheek in a gesture meant to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Donovan slipped the needle into her flesh, and she jerked in surprise, her shocked gaze going to Donovan. Panic flared in her blue eyes, and she went crazy.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted hoarsely. \u201cGod, please, let me go. Please!\u201d</p> <p>Her begging nearly undid Sam. Even Garrett looked discomfited by the desperation in her cries.</p><p>Sam dropped down and pulled her into his arms. He held her against him to still her struggles. When she finally figured out she couldn\u2019t win against him, she sagged in defeat, her noisy sobs echoing sharply across the room.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Donovan muttered as he recapped the syringe. He threw it angrily into his bag and turned away, his shoulders tense.</p><p>Sam held on to her, stroking her hair, offering her comfort even though it was the last thing he wanted to give.</p><p>There were several missing pieces of the puzzle. She hadn\u2019t told them everything. A lot didn\u2019t make sense, but now wasn\u2019t the time to try to drag it out of her. She was hysterical, in pain, and soon she\u2019d be out when the drugs hit her system.</p><p>Most importantly, he and his brothers had to move fast. If all she said was true\u2014if there was any possibility that she was telling the truth\u2014they had to lock down their entire family.</p><p>He needed to contact Sean. He needed to pull in Steele and Rio and their teams. Mom and Dad and Rusty were vulnerable, as were Ethan and Rachel. They could all be targets.</p><p>He looked up to find Garrett staring fiercely back at him, and he knew Garrett was thinking the same things he was.</p> <p>Sophie went completely limp against him, and he carefully pried her away from him to see that her she had finally surrendered to the painkiller Donovan had injected.</p><p>Her eyes were swollen and her skin was blotchy and red from crying. She looked delicate and frail, but underneath that deceptive fa\u00e7ade was a devious woman who had no compunction about carrying out the orders of her father\u2014a man who\u2019d been responsible for more deaths than a lot of wars.</p><p>And the hell of it was she was carrying Sam\u2019s child. Which meant, like it or not, she was going to be forever tied to him through that child. No matter what she\u2019d done in the past or what her motives were now, he had to protect her and keep both her and his son or daughter alive.</p><p>He carefully extricated himself from around her and made sure she was arranged comfortably on the pillows. He pulled the covers up over her body and then turned to face his brothers.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move fast.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>\u201cDO you believe her?\u201d Garrett asked when they assembled in the living room. \u201cDo you believe any of that shit?\u201d</p><p>Garrett still wore a look of discomfort after the episode with Sophie just moments before, but Sam was sure his brother didn\u2019t realize how much her distress had affected him. It would just piss Garrett off.</p><p>\u201cWhether I believe her or not, we have to treat this as a legitimate threat. Her wounds aren\u2019t faked and neither is the fact that I pulled her half-dead out of the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Donovan said.</p><p>Garrett blew out his breath but nodded.</p><p>Sam looked to Donovan first. \u201cI want you to get in touch with Ethan. Give him a heads-up on what\u2019s going on. Make damn sure he keeps his ears and eyes open for any threat to him and Rachel. And for God\u2019s sake tell him not to come home. He could be walking into a trap.\u201d</p><p>Garrett nodded his agreement.</p><p>\u201cThen I want you to get on the phone with Sean. Tell him to head out to Mom and Dad\u2019s until we can get over there.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at Garrett. \u201cWe need to have a look and see if anything\u2019s out there. I\u2019m not walking into broad daylight with Sophie when I don\u2019t know what if anything\u2019s out there waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cYou keep an eye on Sophie and stick by the radio. If there\u2019s anything out there, I\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>While Donovan made his phone calls, Garrett escaped through the basement tunnel leading down to the lake, and Sam did a step-by-step reconnaissance of the house, checking for any possible angles a shooter could use.</p><p>The basement was solid, almost as much of a fortress as the war room on the adjacent lot, but there was only one way out of it if the house was breached, and he\u2019d prefer to use it as a last resort.</p><p>On the main level, the problem areas were the kitchen, which had a window facing the wooded area across the road in front of the house, and Sam\u2019s bedroom, where Sophie slept. The window there was an open invitation for someone to take out anyone in the room.</p><p>He hoped to hell she was still under from the pain medication. The last thing he wanted to do was wake her up and have her wanting to split when he and his brothers hadn\u2019t fully scoped the situation.</p><p>Carefully he slid his arms underneath her warm body and lifted, inch by inch, holding his breath when she stirred and snuggled into his chest.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d she murmured in her sleepy, sweet voice. One he\u2019d heard so many times when he woke her to make love to her again.</p><p>It was a compulsion to slide his lips over her hair. It was still damp and matted by the lake water, but she still smelled uniquely Sophie.</p><p>It pissed him off. In a situation where he needed to be in absolute and complete control of his judgment and emotions, he was decidedly . . . not.</p><p>He went back into the living room, where he\u2019d already placed blankets and pillows on the sofa. He eased Sophie onto the cushions and arranged her arm so nothing would press on it. Before he was tempted to linger, he turned away, refusing to look at her any longer.</p><p>Donovan met him a few steps away.</p><p>\u201cEthan\u2019s not happy. He wanted to hop on the next plane home. But at the same time he didn\u2019t want to drag Rachel into the middle of something we don\u2019t yet understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not stupid. He\u2019ll do what it takes to protect Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean\u2019s heading to Mom and Dad\u2019s now.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s voice came in low and serious over the radio. Donovan and Sam both froze as they listened.</p><p>\u201cSam, I\u2019ve got someone. Two o\u2019clock. West. He\u2019s surrounded by camo netting. He\u2019s damn near invisible. He\u2019s clearly on observation duty. He\u2019s it. Rest of the perimeter is clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cYou have a clear shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegative. Tree\u2019s in my way.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s nostrils flared. No one hunted him on his own turf. \u201cMaintain your position. I\u2019m going after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m locked. He moves and I got him. Be careful, Sam. This guy looks to be a professional.\u201d</p><p>Donovan met Sam\u2019s gaze with hard eyes. \u201cYou should stay here, Sam. Let me go after him. If Sophie wakes, she\u2019ll need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll need you more,\u201d Sam said shortly. \u201cYou\u2019re the medic.\u201d</p><p>Donovan nodded, not arguing though Sam knew he wasn\u2019t happy with the decision.</p><p>Sam suited up, his mind focused on the fact that there was a threat out there to his family.</p><p>Stalking his prey was what Sam did best. He was patient and cunning. He\u2019d once spent six hours closing in on a sniper and took him out without the enemy, positioned a mere fifteen yards away, ever knowing.</p><p>This was more important. This man posed a threat to everything Sam held most dear in the world. His brothers. His family. And now his child.</p><p>And Sophie.</p><p>The voice whispered in his ear, a reminder he didn\u2019t want.</p><p>When he finally got the intruder in his sights, he merely watched, gauging the man\u2019s intent. He was a soldier or a mercenary, and he too was patient.</p><p>His movements were measured. He watched the house through binoculars and occasionally he\u2019d scout the area around the house. Looking for anyone watching him.</p><p>Sam smiled to himself. The asshole would never see Garrett unless Garrett wanted him to.</p><p>Without a sound, Sam unsheathed his knife and crept forward, pausing when the wind stopped or his target moved. He was three feet away and the man still hadn\u2019t detected his presence. Then the wind shifted, blowing from the west. The man turned up his head, nostrils expanding as he scented Sam like a wild animal.</p><p>Before he could turn, Sam was on him. The blade pressed into the neck smeared with camo paint, and Sam hissed his demand close to the man\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cWho sent you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>The intruder twisted and tried to ram his gun between him and Sam. Sam sliced, cutting the man\u2019s throat in one quick motion.</p><p>The hiss of escaping air and the slight gurgle of blood were the only sounds denting the breeze.</p><p>\u201cGood work,\u201d Garrett said into Sam\u2019s earpiece.</p><p>Sam held up the okay sign and then signaled that he\u2019d take care of the body. He\u2019d have left it there to rot, but one, it was too damn close to his house and he didn\u2019t want to smell the bastard, and two, it would be a headache for Sean when the body was discovered.</p><p>Better it disappear for good.</p><p>An hour later, he returned to the house to find Garrett and Donovan both waiting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve set a secure perimeter around the house,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cNo one will be able to so much as piss in the direction of this house without us knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to call Steele and Rio in,\u201d Sam said as he glanced toward the couch where Sophie still slept. \u201cMouton made the mistake of stepping onto our turf. We\u2019ll take the fight to him. This time he goes down.\u201d</p><p>Both Garrett and Donovan nodded their heads in agreement.</p><p>\u201cUntil Rio and Steele get here with their teams, we stay put. I don\u2019t want to get Sean or Mom and Dad involved in any way. We\u2019ll put big shiny targets on our asses and dare the bastards to come and get us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 A,\u201d Garrett snarled.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sophie?\u201d Donovan asked.</p><p>Again Sam glanced over to her curled up body on the couch.</p><p>\u201cShe stays with me. She doesn\u2019t get out of our sight.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE struggled in her dreams. The thing was she was aware enough to know she was only dreaming, but she couldn\u2019t shake out of the hazy world of sleep. Exhaustion held her too firmly in its grasp.</p><p>The assassin was holding her while he slowly carved a line into her belly. She felt the skin give way. Horror overcame her. She screamed, a giant, silent scream. She couldn\u2019t get her lips to work, and her mouth was as dry as sawdust.</p><p>Whimpers tore from her mouth, and she shoved invisible arms away from her. But still, she felt that blade, cutting closer to her womb.</p><p>\u201cSophie. Sophie!\u201d</p><p>The gruff voice startled her to wakefulness. Panic shrieked through her spine. God, she wasn\u2019t dreaming. He was here. He was standing over her ready to kill her.</p><p>She came up swinging. Her fist connected with his nose, and she felt the satisfying snap as his head popped back.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>The snarl had her rolling over despite the scream of protest from her arm. She drew back, ready to hit him again, her other arm instinctively over her belly.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, it\u2019s me, Garrett. You were dreaming.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and stared up at the man looming over her. He was holding his nose, and blood smeared his fingers.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even bring herself to apologize. The words stuck in her throat as she remembered what an ass he\u2019d been so far. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d Donovan demanded as he walked up. He looked at Garrett with an expression of disbelief. Then he cocked his head in Sophie\u2019s direction and arched an eyebrow in question.</p><p>\u201cShe decked me,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>Donovan\u2019s shoulders shook and his lips twitched. His eyes gleamed in merriment.</p><p>Garrett made a sound that came out as a grunt. \u201cShe packs a mean right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d she said in disgust. \u201cI thought you were the asshole trying to kill my baby.\u201d</p><p>She clutched her arms tighter around herself and refused to look back up at them. The two men remained silent, and finally she heard Garrett walk away. A moment later she heard the kitchen faucet turn on.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sam?\u201d she asked, still not looking at Donovan.</p><p>\u201cMaking another pass. Making sure we don\u2019t have more company.\u201d</p><p>She did look then. \u201cMore? Are they here already?\u201d She shook her head, clearing the remnants of her drugged, fogged-up feeling.</p> <p>\u201cYou drugged me,\u201d she said through her teeth as she sat forward on the couch.</p><p>He stepped warily away. The memory came flooding back of her begging and pleading for them to let her go.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s out there?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>She rose unsteadily to her feet and cursed when Donovan reached out to prevent her from falling.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay? Maybe you should sit back down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay away from me,\u201d she muttered as she side-stepped him.</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cYou were in pain.\u201d</p><p>She bared her teeth. \u201cWhen is Sam going to be back? And you never answered my question. Who\u2019s out there?\u201d</p><p>Garrett returned from the kitchen and frowned in her direction.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who was out there. He wasn\u2019t up for conversation,\u201d Donovan said.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you two out there with Sam?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat if something happens to him?\u201d</p><p>Garrett shot her an incredulous look. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to him. Sam can handle himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say. You\u2019re in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want something to eat?\u201d Donovan asked.</p> <p>Startled, she glanced at him, trying to remember the last time she\u2019d eaten. Powered by the suggestion, her stomach caved, and she broke out in a sweat. Her hands shook.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Donovan said gently. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you some soup, okay?\u201d</p><p>With a resigned sigh, she sank back onto the cushion. Donovan disappeared into the kitchen, leaving her with Garrett.</p><p>\u201cDo you always have that look on your face?\u201d she asked.</p><p>For a moment his frown slipped and he looked startled by the question. Then he scowled but didn\u2019t reply. She shrugged and settled back on the couch, closing her eyes wearily.</p><p>Her drug-induced coma hadn\u2019t been a substitute for a good hard sleep, and now her body was nearing shutdown. The smell of chicken wafted across her nose, and she stirred but was so tired, she wasn\u2019t sure she could summon the strength to open her eyes and eat.</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open to see Sam standing there, his gaze boring into her. Had he always been so tall and muscled? She\u2019d spent a lot of time naked with him, but now, dressed in a black T-shirt and camo pants, he looked . . . fierce. Like a man she didn\u2019t know and wasn\u2019t sure of.</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was then she saw the bowl in his hand. She swallowed nervously. They hadn\u2019t talked\u2014hadn\u2019t said anything since she\u2019d dropped her bomb on him. Should she tell him her father was dead? That she\u2019d killed him? Would he even believe her?</p><p>Her stomach bottomed out again, and she covered her nervousness by shifting position on the couch. Her arm was starting to ache fiercely again, and despite her anger over the forced painkiller, it would have been nice to have the pain subside again.</p><p>She cleared her throat, hating to show weakness. She\u2019d been forced to show strength in front of her father for so long that it was ingrained.</p><p>\u201cDo you have something for pain?\u201d she asked. \u201cLike a pill. Something that won\u2019t knock me out.\u201d</p><p>The lines in Sam\u2019s forehead deepened. \u201cOf course. Here.\u201d He handed her the bowl and slid the spoon around the inside until it rested against her finger. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some ibuprofen.\u201d</p><p>She cupped the bowl in her palms and let the warmth bleed into her hands. She sighed as she inhaled and closed her eyes to let the steam rise over her cheeks. It smelled like heaven.</p><p>Sam returned with a small plastic bottle and a glass of milk. He shook out a couple of the tablets and sat next to her on the couch. Then he held up the milk.</p><p>His gaze dropped to her belly. \u201cFor the baby,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>Carefully she put the bowl on her lap, balancing it carefully so the soup didn\u2019t spill. Touched by the gesture, she took the milk and the pills and then peered at him over the rim of the glass as she chased the medicine down.</p><p>It was hard to gauge his mood. He was frowning, but then it seemed all the Kellys loved to frown.</p><p>His eyes flickered, and again he looked down at her belly.</p><p>She drained the glass and set it aside before reaching for the bowl again. He made her uneasy, watching her as she sipped at the broth. They were all watching her like she was some bug under a microscope, some undiscovered species.</p><p>Spoonful by spoonful she concentrated on the warm liquid that coated her throat down to her empty stomach. When she was finished, Sam took the bowl, their hands touching for just an instant.</p><p>He paused and she stared down at those fingers, remembering how they felt on her body, how tender he\u2019d been. How rough he\u2019d been. And demanding.</p><p>She shook away those memories, determined that they not have sway in the here and now. Who was she kidding? She\u2019d wish away the present in a heartbeat if she could just go back to those precious days she\u2019d spent in his arms.</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t go back. She\u2019d give up a lot but not her freedom. Maybe she\u2019d made a mistake to run to Sam. She\u2019d thought she was out of options, but maybe she should have just kept on running.</p><p>She looked into his eyes, meeting that steady gaze with steel determination.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>SAM pulled a small digital camera from his pocket and turned the LCD toward Sophie.</p><p>\u201cRecognize him?\u201d</p><p>She recoiled, and her stomach heaved. She jerked her head away as her breaths hiccupped from her mouth. The man was obviously dead, a gaping cut to the throat.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back and folded both arms over her belly. Then she nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who threatened to kill our baby,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about him anymore.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her gaze to meet Sam\u2019s. There was anger reflected in the blue. But there was also coldness and she shivered against the violence of it.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Neither did she hesitate. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was one of your father\u2019s personal assassins,\u201d Sam said. He pushed a button on the camera and then turned it again so she could see.</p><p>Yes, she knew her father required his men to have the symbol of their loyalty branded into their arm. It was barbaric and senseless, but then he\u2019d never had a shortage of men willing to die for him.</p><p>\u201cYou need to start talking, Sophie. There\u2019s a hell of a lot I need to know.\u201d</p><p>If he was angry, she could deal with that. Anger would be justified. But his voice was cold. He could have been interrogating a prisoner.</p><p>I\u2019m pregnant with your child. She wanted to scream it. Don\u2019t you remember how we made her?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t betray you, Sam,\u201d she said fiercely.</p><p>His lips tightened. He glanced toward his brothers, who stood silently across the room, and dismissed them with a nod.</p><p>As soon as they were gone, Sam stood, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to sit that close to her. For a while he kept his back turned, and heavy silence settled over the room. Then he turned, his eyes flat.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me, Sophie. What exactly did you do?\u201d</p><p>She flinched and it pissed her off. She felt pinned to the couch, helpless. She couldn\u2019t stand the weight of his stare another moment.</p><p>Her hands curled over the edge of the couch, and she pushed herself up, ignoring the pain in her arm.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bark the order, but it was an order nonetheless. Her chin went up in her best go-to-hell impression.</p><p>It took courage to go to him. Courage to face him down when he could so easily turn away and crush her without thought.</p><p>It made her angry that she cared. Made her angry that it mattered. She\u2019d done what she had to do to survive. She shouldn\u2019t have to explain herself to anyone.</p><p>\u201cI knew you had secrets, that you weren\u2019t honest with me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose you did.\u201d</p><p>The words tripped out with a hint of sarcasm. She ignored it and went on, refusing to give him the fight he seemed to want.</p><p>\u201cI knew and I understood. I didn\u2019t care. I wanted that time with you even though I knew when it was over that you\u2019d walk away and that I was never supposed to know who you were or ever expect more than what you gave me.\u201d</p><p>His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed as he swallowed, and he looked away as if he was uncomfortable with the direction the conversation had turned. Would it kill him so much to admit that she\u2019d hurt him? Did anything hurt this man? She wasn\u2019t trying to make him feel guilt. She accepted her role in deception as easily as she\u2019d accepted his. Maybe she would have felt differently if she\u2019d ever believed even for a moment that things were honest between them.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t betray you,\u201d she said again.</p><p>His gaze lifted, and those piercing blue eyes caught her again. This time there was a genuine question there instead of accusation and disbelief.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Sweet relief sang through her mind. The weight that hovered so unbearably on her shoulders lightened, and she forgot the pain in her arm\u2014and in her heart.</p><p>With those two words he told her he\u2019d listen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already explained that my father sent me to you. He wanted me to glean whatever information I could\u2014in any manner it took.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you went.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. She knew how bad it looked. She wouldn\u2019t apologize though, and she wouldn\u2019t allow Sam to make her feel shame for her choice.</p><p>\u201cYou were my best chance at escape. I never intended to do anything more than make my father think I was doing what he wanted. But I saw you and I wanted you more than I wanted my freedom.\u201d</p><p>The color deepened in his eyes. They went dark and his body went still.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want your freedom?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She kept her gaze even, not betraying the surge of rage that flashed through her blood.</p><p>\u201cI hated him.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s brow furrowed and he frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what kind of man he was\u2014is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what did he do to you, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides demanding that I whore myself for him? Is it important? I would think that\u2019s bad enough. You said it yourself. Who the hell does that? What kind of father asks his daughter to do that?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t everything, but it was all Sam needed to know, and it was certainly a credible enough reason for a daughter to hate her father.</p><p>\u201cRemember the note, Sam? The one you received that last morning?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who sent it. I\u2019m the one who told you about the arms shipment and when and where it was going down.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in shock and then narrowed just as quickly. His lips drew into a tight line, and he looked suspiciously at her.</p><p>She rubbed her chest, trying in vain to wipe away the ache. No, he didn\u2019t trust her. She didn\u2019t blame him, but it hurt nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cWant me to tell you what was in it?\u201d</p><p>She quoted back the contents in a low, steady voice and never broke his gaze. She wouldn\u2019t look away, wouldn\u2019t give him any reason to believe she was lying. Word for word. She knew them by heart. She should. She\u2019d typed up the note, printed it out in the hotel lobby and paid the front desk clerk to deliver it.</p><p>Sam dragged a hand over his hair, looked away and then back at her, shaking his head as if he couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I don\u2019t understand. Why not just tell me?\u201d</p><p>She tried to laugh, but her throat closed in on her. \u201cWhat would you have done, Sam? If I had unloaded that kind of story on you, would you have believed me? You would have been angry, just like you are now. You would have been suspicions of any information I gave you about my father.\u201d</p><p>He nodded grudgingly and sighed his acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cI waited long enough for you to leave and then I took my opportunity. I was helped by two employees in my father\u2019s house who were loyal to my mother and, as a result, me. I\u2019ve been running ever since.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen did you find out you were pregnant?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, remembering all too vividly the fear and the joy. The panic that she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep herself or her child safe as her pregnancy progressed.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cMaybe if I hadn\u2019t been so busy slipping from place to place, keeping one step ahead of my father\u2019s men, I would have realized that the fatigue and sickness wasn\u2019t due to stress and fear. When I noticed my pants were snug and I hadn\u2019t been eating well, I tried to remember the last time I\u2019d had a period. Then I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat time in the shower,\u201d Sam murmured.</p> <p>She smiled faintly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come to me immediately? If you were in trouble and you knew where to find me, why didn\u2019t you come before now?\u201d</p><p>If only it had been that easy.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I didn\u2019t know I was pregnant until six weeks ago\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the only reason you came? Because you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p> <p>He sounded accusing, and she just stared at him. What had he expected?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big part, yeah,\u201d she said, her chin going up.</p><p>She could be as belligerent as him any day of the week. Damn it, but she was tired of having to defend herself.</p><p>\u201cThis is the first place they would have looked for me. They\u2019ve probably been watching you for months, waiting for me to show up. It\u2019s the only reason you\u2019re still alive. My father had information on KGI. While he may not have had the balls to launch an all-out attack on you here, he would have done whatever was necessary to take you out. He\u2019s a patient man when it comes to vengeance.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cWhat changed then? Why now?\u201d The overt suspicion in his voice hit her like a poisoned dart. Yeah, she knew he had a right, but it was starting to seriously piss her off.</p><p>\u201cWhat changed is that bastard caught up to me. What changed is that I\u2019m not as fast or as agile as I used to be. Being five months pregnant with your child changes a lot, including my ability to take care of myself and protect us both from assholes that my uncle sends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUncle?\u201d</p><p>Sam latched onto her slip, his eyes sharpening.</p><p>\u201cUncle, father, whatever. They\u2019re partners. Either way I betrayed them both. They won\u2019t forgive that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were led to believe that Tomas Mouton was a patsy of your father\u2019s and nothing more. He had no power. Alex pulled all the strings and Tomas just took up space in Mouton\u2019s organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true.\u201d Indeed it was. But with her father dead, Tomas would have seized his opportunity to take over the network. And his first order of business would have been to recover the key Sophie had stolen and execute her for her betrayal of the Mouton family.</p><p>She kept that information buried, unsure of how much if anything she should tell Sam about the key or the fact that she\u2019d killed her father. There was such a thing as too much information all at once. She wanted Sam to be willing to offer her and their child his protection, not toss her out on her ass at the first opportunity.</p><p>\u201cSam, look at me,\u201d she begged softly.</p><p>His gaze lifted and he met her eyes. She flinched at the lack of emotion, but she swallowed her pride.</p> <p>\u201cI know what it looks like. I know you have a right to be suspicious. You think I\u2019m here even now on some fact-finding mission for my father, or maybe I\u2019ll take you down while you sleep because who would suspect a banged-up pregnant woman, right?\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. He wasn\u2019t amused by her statement at all. She wanted to reach out to him, to touch him, but she was too afraid of his rejection, and if it came now, it would crush her.</p><p>\u201cI took a risk by spending so much time with you in that hotel. I lied to my father and said whatever I had to say not to raise his suspicions, because I wanted to be able to return to you each night. I knew you weren\u2019t offering me forever. I knew I was a fling. You don\u2019t have to beat me over the head with that. But I\u2019m not the only one who lied here. You did too.\u201d</p><p>She sucked several steadying breaths through her nose and regained control of her emotions.</p><p>\u201cI also knew that when I gave you the information on the arms deal that you\u2019d leave without once looking back and that it would be up to me to escape my father\u2019s grasp. So yes, if you want to look at it like that, I used you. I used you to get away from my father, but I never gave him a damn thing about you. I didn\u2019t sell you out. He never even knew I\u2019d leaked the information. No, I didn\u2019t sell you out, Sam. I sold my father out. For you. And for a hell of a lot of other people he would have hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now he\u2019s after you. For what, revenge?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and turned her head away. Revenge? Revenge sounded personal. Tomas would make an example of her. A rite of passage in his new role of leadership. He\u2019d want to deal effectively with her. She\u2019d be an example to others how traitors were dispatched. The fact that she was his flesh and blood would only raise his stock among his followers. Like her father, he\u2019d be viewed as a man not to cross. But most importantly, she held the success of that empire in her hands. And for that, he\u2019d be willing to risk everything.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill me and our child as soon as he gets what he wants,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s why I had to finally come to you and hope you would offer me your protection no matter what your feelings might be for me. I can\u2019t do it myself any longer. I almost died. Our child almost died. I\u2019m no longer willing to take the chance of going it alone, even if it means bringing trouble to your front door.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew hard and determined. His jaw tightened in anger, but when he reached out to grasp her arm, his touch was gentle and soothing.</p><p>\u201cThere never should have been any doubt you could come to me. I may be mad as hell. I may feel like a dumbass, but that\u2019s nothing next to your and our child\u2019s safety. Did you honestly think I\u2019d turn you away once you\u2019d explained everything?\u201d</p><p>He sounded incredulous, and once again she was struck by how unfair it all was. She was expected to trust him, but he wasn\u2019t required to believe squat about her or her intentions.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d thought you\u2019d turn me away, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t immediately come here. For one, I had no way of knowing how long you\u2019d be tied up in Mexico. Two, I had no way of knowing if anything would happen to you. Three, once you no longer served the purpose of luring me into the open for my father\u2019s men to snatch, you\u2019d be expendable. Now the clock is ticking because as of the minute I came to you, you\u2019re expendable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really believe all that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him, her shoulders heaving with anger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Sam. You may not think what I\u2019ve done has been smart or that I\u2019ve had the best plan, but you know what? It\u2019s kept me alive so far. And you know what else? It\u2019s kept you alive too.\u201d</p><p>An impatient hiss escaped his lips, and then he gripped her shoulder and turned her back around to face him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a few things straight here, okay? Just so there\u2019s no further misunderstanding in the future. You will not make decisions in regard to your or the baby\u2019s safety at my expense or in an effort to save me. That\u2019s horse shit. My job\u2014what I do\u2014is protect people. From now on that\u2019s you and our baby, Sophie. I\u2019m protecting you both, and the best way you can help me do that is to listen to everything I tell you. Don\u2019t make rash, emotional decisions. And be honest with me. Completely. From now on. Got it?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to deck him for being a condescending jerk, but she could see he truly wasn\u2019t attempting to talk down to her. He was in total command mode, and he was talking to her like he\u2019d talk to one of his men. No nonsense and he expected compliance. She was sorely tempted to snap him a salute and rattle off a snarky \u201cyes sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow come here,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>The deep timbre sent a shiver down her skin. He sounded gruff and a little unsure, but there was also a compelling plea for her to come to him.</p><p>She went and he caught her in his arms, pulling her against his chest. Warm. He was so warm that his heat soaked into her pores and invaded her stiff muscles.</p><p>He felt so good, so absolutely right, that she could do nothing more than stand in the circle of his arms and bury her face in his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect you, Sophie. We have a lot to work out, and we\u2019ll get there. But first I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to make sure no one ever touches you or our child. If you believe nothing else, believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s why I came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wish you\u2019d come sooner,\u201d he said in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd you\u2019re staying.\u201d</p><p>He turned her toward the couch and urged her down once more. After making sure she was propped in a comfortable position, he carefully arranged the blankets around her.</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest and I\u2019ve got to plan our way out of here. Donovan is doing some checking on our assassin. So if you\u2019ll sit tight and let us do our thing, we\u2019ll have you out of here as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>She tried to cover the yawn that threatened to crack her jaw, but gave up and surrendered halfway through.</p><p>He leaned in, kissed her forehead and then smoothed his hand down her face.</p><p>\u201cRest, Sophie, and trust me to protect you and our baby.\u201d</p><p>She stared back up at him. \u201cI do, Sam. I do.\u201d</p><p>Nodding his satisfaction, he turned on his heel and headed out of the living room to find his brothers, and she was left alone, huddled under the blankets on the couch to ponder the mess she\u2019d gotten the entire Kelly family in.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>\u201cWHAT did you find out?\u201d Sam demanded as soon as he returned to Donovan and Garrett.</p><p>Donovan looked up as Sam approached. \u201cI ran the guy\u2019s photo and prints through the CIA database.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. He\u2019s one of Mouton\u2019s all right, but he was assigned to his brother\u2019s security detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting about that?\u201d Garrett asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, the info I gathered suggested that Tomas is a token part of Alex\u2019s network. He has no say, no power, and Alex ignores him as long as Tomas plays by the rules. Which are basically that he keeps his mouth shut and does whatever Alex tells him.</p><p>\u201cNow, yeah this guy would have been chosen and hired and trained for that matter by Alex or his trusted head of security, but he wouldn\u2019t have had any real power or responsibility other than to stick close to Tomas, and if I know Alex, the assassin probably reported to Alex, not Tomas.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned. \u201cSo why send this guy after Sophie? If her father\u2019s so pissed, or he wants revenge or he wants to send a message, why send this joker? He wasn\u2019t completely inept, but he wasn\u2019t hard to take down. Why not send one of his best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy send anyone at all?\u201d Garrett demanded. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re missing something here. Yeah, so Sophie\u2019s his daughter and she bailed. Mouton doesn\u2019t strike me as the sentimental type. Why would he give a shit about a woman? The guy\u2019s a first-class asshole. He\u2019s trafficked in women and children. I doubt he understands the first thing about familial sentiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sold him out,\u201d Sam said in a low voice.</p><p>He still wasn\u2019t sure what to make of Sophie\u2019s declaration. His gut told him she was telling the truth. Sometimes it paid to go with your gut. Other times it got you killed. Damn if he knew which was the case this time.</p><p>\u201cSold him out?\u201d Donovan gave Sam a searching look that was threaded with disbelief. \u201cBack up a second. What haven\u2019t you told us?\u201d</p><p>Garrett leaned forward, his ever-present scowl deepening.</p><p>\u201cShe was our informant,\u201d Sam said to Garrett. \u201cThe one who tipped us off about when the arms shipment was going down.\u201d</p><p>Donavan and Garrett exchanged what-the-fuck looks. The words to defend her rushed to Sam\u2019s mouth, but he swallowed them back. He couldn\u2019t defend her. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cShe did all that because you were fucking her?\u201d Garrett asked incredulously.</p><p>Sam turned and slammed into Garrett\u2019s chest, twisting Garrett\u2019s shirt in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of your mouth,\u201d Sam snarled. \u201cYou will have some goddamn respect when talking about the mother of my child, you got me?\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s eyes narrowed, then widened when Sam didn\u2019t back down. He put his hands up. \u201cOkay, okay, my bad.\u201d</p><p>When Sam released his shirt, and Garrett took a step back, swearing the entire way.</p><p>\u201cWill you at least try to look at this objectively?\u201d Garrett asked. \u201cWhat if it were me or Van? One of us hooks up with a chick while we\u2019re on a mission. He gets distracted. Chick shows up months later, after we failed to take down the target, and she\u2019s making all sorts of wild claims, not the least of which is she\u2019s pregnant with Van\u2019s child or my child. Then she says she sold out her flesh and blood for a guy she was with a matter of a few days. Tell me, Sam, would you be saying okay, yeah, whatever?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Donovan remained quiet, but Garrett\u2019s thoughts were reflected in his eyes.</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cWhen did I ever give you two the impression that I\u2019m some emotional dumbass who thinks with his dick? I get that you\u2019re suspicious. I have my own set of doubts, but so far what she\u2019s saying is checking out. And whatever you think, you\u2019ll show some respect for both me and her. If you can\u2019t live with that, then I suggest you get the fuck out, and I\u2019ll go this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shut the fuck up,\u201d Garrett muttered. \u201cYou know good and goddamn well Van and I are behind you. Jesus this is one giant clusterfuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t solve this for me,\u201d Sam said as he stared Garrett down. \u201cI know it goes against every grain that you can\u2019t just step in with a solution. This isn\u2019t just a mission or some job, and you and I both know it. Everything has changed for me, and I\u2019m the only person who can sort it out.\u201d</p> <p>Donovan chuckled, and Sam and Garrett both glared at him.</p><p>\u201cGarrett looks like a whipped puppy because the control freak in him can\u2019t control the situation. And Sam looks like he\u2019s swallowed a rock.\u201d</p><p>Sam held up his middle finger at the exact same time Garrett did, which only made Donovan laugh harder.</p><p>He shook his head and wiped his palm down his jaw. \u201cIf we can get back to the facts at hand. The assassin worked alone. Garrett and I have both been out. There\u2019s no one else. Not yet. We\u2019ve probably bought a few days, until Mouton figures out his guy is dead and sends someone else. He hasn\u2019t impressed me with his intelligence so far, so he may or may not send enough men to get the job done. But then before he was only after a lone woman. Now he has us to contend with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. All of us,\u201d Garrett growled. \u201cNo one fucks with the Kellys.\u201d</p> <p>Sam grinned and then let the smile fade. \u201cWe need to get to Mom and Dad\u2019s to make sure they\u2019re okay, have Steele and Rio meet us there and figure out our next move. I don\u2019t give a shit what the CIA\u2019s doing. We\u2019re going to take that bastard out this time.\u201d</p><p>Donovan nodded his agreement. \u201cGo get Sophie. Garrett and I will have the truck ready.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE stared out the window of the SUV as it rolled into the driveway of a quaint wood house that was at least a hundred years old. It was one of those houses you saw in television shows touting suburbia. The perfect porch, the perfect landscaping. An upstairs that probably had at least six bedrooms and a backyard that stretched over several acres.</p><p>It looked homey and welcoming like it had a soul and wasn\u2019t just a cold dwelling constructed to keep others out. No, this house invited people inside to its warmth. Families gathered here.</p><p>It was everything she\u2019d ever wanted in her entire life, and it hurt her that she was going to have to walk into this place with Sam and pretend it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The tires crunched over the gravel, and Garrett pulled the truck to a halt behind a county sheriff\u2019s police car. Sophie jerked her head around to stare at Sam accusingly.</p> <p>\u201cSean is here for the protection of my family,\u201d Sam said shortly. \u201cI didn\u2019t go behind your back and report you to the cops.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed a little, but the knot in her throat grew larger as she stared at the house.</p><p>This was his parents\u2019 house, and she had no concept of how to act around a normal family. But she carried their grandchild, and if nothing else, that gained her something. Didn\u2019t it?</p><p>Donovan opened the door for her, and automatically her chin went up. Sam walked around and reached in to help her out. She grabbed for the waist of the sweatpants to keep them up as Sam tucked her into his side. At least he wasn\u2019t trying to put a world of distance between them. She couldn\u2019t have faced his entire family by herself.</p><p>Garrett and Donovan hurried forward and had the door open by the time she and Sam got there. As soon as she stepped inside, she was greeted by a rush of warm air and the smell\u2014it wasn\u2019t even one identifiable scent. It was a mixture of home-baked food, flowers, cleaner and an older musty smell that came from years of wear.</p><p>It was the best smell she\u2019d ever encountered.</p><p>She inhaled deeply, wanting to savor every bit.</p><p>\u201cSam, Garrett, Donovan? Is that you?\u201d</p> <p>The feminine voice came closer, and in another moment a small woman rounded the corner as if on wheels. She collided with Garrett, bounced off and then promptly pounced on the much larger man.</p><p>\u201cGarrett!\u201d</p><p>She pulled him into her arms, and Sophie watched in fascination as Garrett transformed in front of her eyes. He went from surly, scowling ape to a gentle mama\u2019s boy. It was mind-boggling.</p><p>He scooped her up in his arms, though she seemed to be doing most of the hugging.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine, Ma. Quit squeezing me so hard or I won\u2019t be able to breathe.\u201d</p><p>She kissed both cheeks, patted one and then turned her attention to Donovan, who was watching with an amused smile.</p><p>\u201cGee, Mom, you\u2019d think you never saw us.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him, and Sophie could see where Garrett got it. Their mom could be quite ferocious when provoked.</p><p>She hugged Donovan fiercely, patting and squeezing in random patterns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so worried. Sean showed up mumbling about safety and trouble and then wouldn\u2019t let your father or me out of the house. I was tempted to turn him over my knee.\u201d</p><p>Sam pushed forward shaking his head. \u201cSean did exactly what he was supposed to do, Ma. Don\u2019t be giving him any trouble.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Kelly turned to Sam and her face softened. At the same time she caught sight of Sophie standing to Sam\u2019s side and her expression froze.</p><p>She looked at Donovan and then quickly back at Sam and then focused on Sophie again.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world?\u201d</p><p>She started toward Sophie, and it was all Sophie could do not to turn around and run.</p><p>Mrs. Kelly\u2019s hands came up to brace Sophie\u2019s arms, but Sam was there to push one away from her injury.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Ma. She\u2019s been hurt.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s voice was soft and husky, almost tender. Sophie\u2019s knees began to shake because she couldn\u2019t take this. It was too much. She was scared out of her mind, and the last thing she wanted was rejection.</p><p>\u201cOh my word,\u201d Mrs. Kelly breathed out.</p><p>And before Sophie could expend any more time being terrified, the woman enfolded her in her embrace as carefully as she would a child. And just as suddenly she pulled away and aimed a ferocious glare up at Sam.</p><p>\u201cSam Kelly, what is the meaning of this? This poor girl looks like she\u2019s been in the lake.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and touched Sophie\u2019s bedraggled hair and frowned. Then she glanced downward.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even have shoes!\u201d</p><p>Sam held up his hands, but his mom ignored him.</p><p>Her gaze fastened on Sophie\u2019s belly, and Sophie went completely still. She stood there in dread, chin up, her knees so locked it was a wonder she hadn\u2019t passed out yet.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant! Oh dear Lord. Sam what were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyebrows went up, and he backed away as if unsure of what his mom was referencing.</p><p>\u201cMom, listen to me, okay? There are some things you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it quick,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Sam went back to Sophie\u2019s side and pulled her against him in a gesture that could hardly go unnoticed by his mother. And indeed, Mrs. Kelly\u2019s eyebrow went up, and she looked between Sam and Sophie with obvious curiosity.</p><p>\u201cSophie and I met five months ago while I was on a mission in Mexico. We were . . . involved. She\u2019s in trouble now and needs our help. The entire family could be in trouble, which is why we sent Sean over to stay with you and Dad. My teams will be here in a few hours\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whatever else he might have said was lost in his mother\u2019s gasp.</p><p>\u201cSam Kelly, is this my grandchild you\u2019re allowing to stand in my kitchen with its mother shivering cold and barefooted?\u201d</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, and to think I thought Joe was the son lacking in common sense.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Sophie, ignoring Sam. \u201cSophie, I\u2019m Marlene Kelly and please do call me Marlene. I\u2019ll introduce you to Frank, but first my idiot son needs to take you upstairs for a hot bath and a fresh change of clothes.\u201d</p><p>Sophie smiled, or she tried, but her lips were quivering, and she tried to control the knocking of her knees. The idea of a hot bath was so wonderful that she nearly buckled on the spot. And would have, but Marlene wrapped an arm around her waist and held her up.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Sam, before the poor thing falls over. Garrett and Donovan can tell me all about it while you\u2019re up taking care of your responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>She pinned Sam with a stare that probably made all her sons quake in their boots.</p><p>Sam threaded his hand through Sophie\u2019s and pulled her away from his mother. She wanted that bath. Really wanted it, but she couldn\u2019t imagine how she\u2019d manage.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should take a shower instead. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to get out of the tub once I got in.\u201d</p><p>Her face tightened, and she looked around to make sure no one had overheard her.</p><p>Sam smiled, easing the lines around his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that. I\u2019ll help you in and out.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He cocked one eyebrow at her. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you naked, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She valiantly tried to control the rush of heat creeping up her neck.</p><p>He smiled again and then moved to the side of her and lifted her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But you\u2019ll put less stress on those wounds if I carry you.\u201d</p><p>With that, he headed for the stairs, striding past his family as if they weren\u2019t even there. She refused to make eye contact with any of them. She had no desire for their judgment.</p><p>When they reached the bathroom, he flipped on the light and set her carefully on the counter so that her legs dangled over the edge. Then he reached over to turn on the water in the big garden tub.</p><p>Soon steam rose and she was salivating. She hurt with how badly she wanted that tub full of hot water. She twitched with impatience, watching as the level slowly rose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you get undressed then I\u2019ll get you in the tub. I\u2019ll leave you for as long as you want to soak, and when you want to get out just call for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, too tongue-tied to get words past her lips. He was right. He\u2019d seen her naked. He\u2019d seen her wanton. He\u2019d seen her as indelicately as a man could ever see a woman. There wasn\u2019t an inch of her body he hadn\u2019t explored, and vice versa. So why was she acting so maidenly now? She was pregnant with his child, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>But then there hadn\u2019t been exposed lies between them. No exposed secrets. They\u2019d just been two lovers so wrapped up in each other that the outside world hadn\u2019t been able to intrude.</p><p>\u201cSoph?\u201d he called softly.</p><p>She blinked and refocused on him. His fingers were in the waistband of the too large pair of sweats. He was making sure she was okay with it, and for some reason that softened her heart.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with. I want to get into that tub so bad, I\u2019d crawl in fully clothed.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and slid the pants down until they gathered around her ankles. With a gentle tug they were gone, and he dropped them on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put you down and then we\u2019ll get you out of your shirt.\u201d</p><p>She gave a groan of protest when her feet hit the floor. She didn\u2019t have it in her to stand. Fatigue edged out the pain by a ratio of at least ten to one. Pain had nothing on her desire to sleep. For a year. Pregnancy was exhausting enough. Add in running cross-country, taking multiple dips in the lake and avoiding assholes with knives and guns?</p><p>\u201cI got you. Hold still. I\u2019ll try not to move your arm too much.\u201d</p><p>She stared straight ahead as he maneuvered the shirt from her body, and suddenly she was completely nude in front of him. She hated how vulnerable and naked she felt.</p><p>Dumbass, you are naked.</p><p>Thankfully he didn\u2019t waste any time. As soon as she was free of her clothing, he turned to help her into the tub. She put one leg in and moaned as the hot water slid up her skin.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God yes. I\u2019ve never had anything so good in my life.\u201d</p><p>She gingerly sank down, holding on to his hand. Her body shrieked in protest, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>The water lapped to her chin, and she tilted her head back, closing her eyes. Oh sweet heaven.</p><p>Sam leaned down and gently tapped her chin until she opened her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need me, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded sleepily as the warmth swam intoxicatingly through her veins.</p><p>He turned to go, and she suddenly remembered what she\u2019d wanted to ask him for.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>He turned, holding on to the door edge. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She shifted uncomfortably, seeking more of the water.</p><p>\u201cIs there any way possible I could get some underwear? I hate to ask, but going without a bra sucks when you\u2019re pregnant. I mean my boobs are huge now and they\u2019re sensitive\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She could see the very male shudder work over him. His eye practically twitched at the mention of underwear and bras.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it for you. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, feeling warmth that had nothing to do with bathwater flash over her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>SAM stepped out of the bathroom and rubbed the back of his neck. Sainthood. He deserved sainthood. Not only had he stood in the bathroom with a very gorgeous, very naked woman, but he\u2019d calmly discussed getting her things like a bra and underwear without batting an eyelash.</p> <p>Give him bombs, grenades, blood, guts and gore, but bras?</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>Now, where the hell was he going to get her a bra?</p><p>\u201cHey, get her settled?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked up to see Garrett and Donovan coming up the stairs. He grimaced. \u201cUh yeah. Sorta.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett gave him a look.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a bra. Something about pregnancy and big boobs and I sort of tuned out after that.\u201d</p><p>Donovan\u2019s chest heaved in silent laughter. The bastard.</p><p>\u201cSo get her one,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>Garrett almost pulled off that somber, stick-up-his ass look. Oh yeah, he was good, but Sam saw the flicker of amusement in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere are three women in this house on a constant basis. Surely we can come up with a bra,\u201d Sam muttered.</p> <p>\u201cUh well Rusty and Rachel are smaller,\u201d Donovan said, hedging. \u201cNot that Sophie is like big or anything, but she\u2019s bustier.\u201d</p><p>It dawned on his brothers about the same time it did on Sam. Their faces contorted, and Garrett\u2019s mouth flapped open and shut.</p><p>\u201cChrist. That leaves Mom,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Garrett started backing away, hands out. \u201cOh no. Hell no. I\u2019m not asking Ma for one of her bras. That\u2019s just . . . wrong.\u201d</p><p>Donovan looked like he\u2019d swallowed a bug, and then both he and Garrett stared at Sam.</p><p>\u201cYour woman. You do it.\u201d</p><p>Sam cleared his throat. \u201cRock, paper, scissors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d Donovan snorted.</p> <p>\u201cYou pussies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go. We\u2019ll pay for your therapy later,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>Sam turned in disgust and stalked away.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably know Ma\u2019s not very happy with you right now,\u201d Donovan called after him.</p><p>Sam turned. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett and I filled her in. You know on the story. About how you knocked Sophie up, came home, then fished her out of the lake.\u201d</p><p>Sam blew out his breath and turned his face up toward the ceiling. \u201cYeah, and I bet you really hated telling her all that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Garrett shrugged. \u201cYou can thank us later, man.\u201d</p><p>Sam held up his middle finger and hurried down the stairs to face his mom.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>SAM hovered near the bathroom door and checked his watch. She hadn\u2019t called out, and he kept returning for fear he wouldn\u2019t hear her when she did. He couldn\u2019t decide whether to go in and check on her or wait it out.</p><p>The decision was taken from him when he heard her soft call filter through the door.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>He pushed in, hastily tossing the items his mom had given him on the counter. When he turned to her, he saw her drowsy eyes watching him. Her face was flushed with the steam from the bath, and her hair lay damply against her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cI tried to get out, but it hurt. I was afraid of falling.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and moved forward. \u201cI told you I\u2019d help you. You ready to get out now?\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded, and he reached down, sliding his arms into the water. His hand glanced off her lush bottom and then went to the tender flesh underneath her knees. He lifted, and the water rushed over her skin like silk. He was riveted to the sight of her swollen, lush body.</p><p>He stood her up long enough to get a towel around her. She glanced shyly up at him, her blue eyes sweet. Just like they\u2019d been the first time he ever saw her.</p><p>He\u2019d hated seeing her work in that dive. She was too young, too innocent to be exposed to the assholes who frequented the joint. Now he felt like an idiot, because after living with her father, the guys at the bar had to have seemed like Boy Scouts.</p><p>\u201cI can dry myself,\u201d she said after clearing her throat.</p><p>He turned to the counter and gingerly raised the bra with one finger. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t ideal, but it was the closest thing we thought would fit you. The uhm underwear, well as long as it doesn\u2019t fall off . . . You could pull it up over your belly.\u201d</p><p>Amusement twinkled in her eyes, but she smiled as if he\u2019d just given her diamonds.</p><p>\u201cThank you. This will be perfect.\u201d</p><p>She bobbled just a bit when she tried to step forward, and he picked her up and set her on the counter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all that hot water,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019ll make you light-headed, especially when you\u2019re pregnant. You probably shouldn\u2019t have stayed in so long.\u201d</p><p>She arched one golden brow at him. \u201cHow do you know so much about pregnant women?\u201d</p><p>An uncomfortable prickle assaulted his neck. \u201cI uhm must have read it somewhere.\u201d</p><p>He turned right and then left and realized she was still trapped in her towel and she needed to get dressed.</p><p>There was a short knock at the door, and he scowled as he turned. He opened it just a crack so whoever was outside wouldn\u2019t see in. Donovan stood there holding a pair of pants and a T-shirt. He thrust them toward Sam.</p><p>\u201cFigured she\u2019d do better if she wasn\u2019t running around in just Ma\u2019s bra and underwear.\u201d</p><p>There was a hint of a grin on Donovan\u2019s lips, and Sam glared a giant hole through his head.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d</p><p>He grinned again and then sauntered off.</p><p>Sam called him a few choice words and retreated into the bathroom, where Sophie was still perched on the counter, the towel gripped tight at her chin.</p><p>The towel split just at her belly, and he was afforded a tiny glimpse of the gentle mound that shielded his child. It wasn\u2019t as if he hadn\u2019t seen it a couple of times already. It was the way just a hint showed from the protective confines of the towel.</p><p>Careful so as not to spook her, he slowly dipped his hands into that little part and pushed the towel aside so that more of her belly was bared.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>His name came out breathless. A little hesitant. A little nervous. But there was no fear in her voice.</p><p>\u201cLet me see her, Soph. I want to see my daughter. One moment where it\u2019s just us. No distractions. No danger. Just you and me and our child.\u201d</p><p>Her hand loosened its grip on the corner of the towel, and finally she dropped it altogether. The material fell away, baring her breasts and her belly. Even the delicate, feminine V of her legs, with the soft, silvery blond wisps of hair, was visible.</p><p>It was the most beautiful sight he\u2019d ever seen. Here on this counter, Sophie bruised and battered, her hair wet and fatigue pulling at her eyes. Was there a more beautiful sight than a lushly pregnant woman?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist touching her. The tips of his fingers brushed along the tops of her thighs, around to her hips and finally up and over the tautness of her abdomen. As they gathered at her center, her belly dipped and jerked.</p><p>He drew away, stunned. \u201cThat was her!\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s face lit up like a million candles. \u201cYes. That\u2019s her.\u201d Her own hand came to cradle her belly, and she rocked back and forth as though she was sitting in a chair soothing her baby.</p><p>Drawn by a power he didn\u2019t understand, Sam lowered his head, inch by inch until his lips were just a breath away from that tiny little pitter-patter. He pressed his mouth in the gentlest of kisses even as he palmed both sides of Sophie\u2019s belly to hold her in place.</p><p>The tiny kick against his lips had him smiling in sheer delight.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s saying hello,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>When he looked up at Sophie, he was taken aback by the sheer sadness in her eyes. He could swear there were tears, but she blinked and they were gone. What could possibly have upset her?</p><p>He crinkled his brow and touched a hand to her cheek. \u201cIs everything okay, Soph?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, though it looked shaky to him. \u201cI\u2019m fine. The bath did wonders. I feel like a new woman.\u201d</p><p>It was almost easy to forget that she was sitting naked in front of him\u2014if he didn\u2019t keep getting distracted by the breasts he and his brothers had discussed in depth out in the hall.</p><p>Her nipples\u2014one of his favorite things\u2014were darker now instead of the delectable shade of pink they\u2019d been. They looked browner, ruby almost. He\u2019d give anything to taste her one more time. To run his tongue along the puckered peak and feel her come apart in his arms.</p><p>His body tightened painfully, and he nearly unmanned himself by bumping into the counter edge. Son of a bitch that hurt!</p><p>\u201cI um got you a bra. It\u2019s right here. Donovan brought you some pants and a T-shirt. We\u2019ll get you shoes when you\u2019re dressed. Let me help you get into everything, and then we\u2019ll see what we have to work with.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at the bra. \u201cGod, it\u2019s one of those torture devices. One of those thirty-six-hour jobs or whatever they\u2019re called.\u201d</p><p>Sam laughed. Even he\u2019d heard enough television commercials to know there were eighteen-hour bras. But who the hell would want to stay in such a barbaric contraption for eighteen hours? Those things weren\u2019t for sissies.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to help me get it on. I can\u2019t put it on backward and twist it around. It\u2019ll kill my arm. I\u2019ll put the cups on and you fasten the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell hell,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of practice getting women out of bras, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever helped a woman into one.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a grin. \u201cThen you\u2019ll learn something new and useful.\u201d</p><p>She positioned the bra, looped the straps over her shoulders, and he stared down at the dangling clasp. How hard could it be?</p><p>He fastened the clips and tried very hard not to remember where he\u2019d gotten this or who had worn it last, because there was only so much his brain could take.</p><p>\u201cJust hold the underwear. I\u2019ll step in,\u201d she directed.</p><p>He bent and held what looked to be grannie panties out and open while she grabbed on to his wrists for support and cautiously threaded one leg at a time into the holes. A few seconds later, she had underwear all the way over her belly and she burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cI look like a goober,\u201d she said, still laughing.</p><p>\u201cThe clothes will cover it.\u201d Thank God. Even as unattractive as his mom\u2019s girly things were, Sophie still managed to look sensational in them. He could tie a garbage sack around her and she\u2019d still light up a room.</p><p>The pants weren\u2019t hard, but the shirt was more awkward. He merely stretched out the armholes until he could fit her arms through without making her do contortionist tricks.</p><p>\u201cWant me to dry your hair?\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise. \u201cWould you? It would be so hard to do it one-handed.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the blow-dryer. \u201cCan you stand for this long or would you prefer to sit on the toilet seat?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his chest and eased her way onto the closed toilet.</p><p>He started the dryer and threaded his hand through the strands as he motioned the blower up and down. After a few minutes, he took a brush from the counter and delicately drew it through her tresses.</p><p>She closed her eyes and held her face upturned just a bit, like she was experiencing the first rays of sun after a long winter. Wanting to continue pleasing her, he brushed the strands as he blew over them, until they shone like spun gold.</p><p>\u201cNo one has brushed my hair for me since I was a child,\u201d she murmured, her eyes still closed. \u201cIt feels wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never brushed a woman\u2019s hair before,\u201d he admitted ruefully.</p><p>She opened her eyes and they smiled back at him through the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the idea that you were an expert at getting women out of their clothes and messing up their hair, but maybe not so much with anything that came afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that many women,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She cocked her head, and he could see the question brewing on her lips.</p><p>Once again, a knock at the door interrupted them. Sam blew out his breath in relief, turned off the dryer and laid it aside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s open,\u201d he called.</p><p>Donovan stuck his head inside. \u201cI have Mom\u2019s med kit if you want me to look over Sophie\u2019s stitches. She\u2019s insisting on calling Doc, but I made her wait to see what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, let me take her in the bedroom so you\u2019ll have room,\u201d Sam replied. \u201cTell Mom to hold her horses. Didn\u2019t you explain to her the situation we\u2019re in here? We can\u2019t be calling everyone in Stewart County to come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah , but you know Mom,\u201d Donovan said in amusement.</p><p>Sam touched Sophie on the shoulder as Donovan backed out of the bathroom. \u201cCan you make it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rose tentatively and then smiled. \u201cAmazing what a hot bath and clean clothes will do for you.\u201d</p><p>Still, he took her hand and laced his fingers with hers as he led her out of the bathroom and toward his parents\u2019 bedroom.</p><p>\u201cJust have her sit,\u201d Donovan said as he motioned toward the end of the bed. \u201cThis won\u2019t take but a minute.\u201d</p><p>Sam watched as Donovan carefully pulled Sophie\u2019s shirt down over her shoulder so he could examine the stitched wound.</p> <p>Impatiently, Sam stepped forward. \u201cDoes it look all right?\u201d</p><p>Donovan turned to his brother. \u201cYeah, it does. It looks really good. I\u2019ll just put on some more antibiotic ointment and fresh bandages and she\u2019ll be good to go.\u201d</p><p>Sam touched Sophie\u2019s hair, now glossy and clean. She turned her face up to him, and he wanted to touch her more.</p><p>\u201cAre you in any pain? Van can get you some more pain medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ibuprofen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019s making a feast. You two should come down and eat. Then Sophie can take her medicine on a full stomach,\u201d Donovan said.</p><p>Sam saw the longing in Sophie\u2019s eyes and nodded at Donovan. \u201cWe\u2019ll be down. Have Ma set up a tray so Sophie can sit on the couch where it\u2019s comfortable.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>CLEAN and warm. And now she was staring at a tray in front of her holding more food than she could possibly eat, but damn if she wasn\u2019t going to give it her best shot.</p><p>There was a bowl of chicken and dumplings, a grilled cheese sandwich, potato salad and a plate of pot roast with mashed potatoes and gravy.</p><p>Marlene had jokingly told her that she\u2019d cleaned out her refrigerator, and since she hadn\u2019t known what Sophie liked, she made her a little of everything.</p> <p>Mouth watering, Sophie dipped into the chicken and dumplings first. She ignored the goings-on around her and dug into each of the dishes, savoring each and every bite.</p><p>When the couch dipped beside her, Sophie looked up to see a teenaged girl staring curiously at her. She didn\u2019t fit the mold of the rest of the Kelly family, and maybe that was on purpose.</p><p>She had an interesting shade of green through her chestnut hair, a nose piercing and a row of earrings in her left ear. While the girl wouldn\u2019t have stood out in most high schools, here in this seemingly conservative, strait-laced household, she stood out like orange neon glow.</p><p>Since the girl continued to stare at her, Sophie stared back, childishly refusing to back down under the teen\u2019s scrutiny.</p><p>The girl sniffed and then turned to grin in Sam\u2019s direction. \u201cSounds like Marlene needs to be lecturing someone else on safe sex, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRusty, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Frank Kelly bellowed.</p><p>Sophie jumped and looked cautiously at the burly older man. His bark seemed worse than his bite, but she couldn\u2019t be sure on such a short acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t keep a civil tongue in your head, you can go back upstairs,\u201d Frank said. Then he turned to Sophie. \u201cThe smart-mouthed young lady sitting next to you is Rusty. Don\u2019t mind her. She likes to needle my boys.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie swallowed her bite and didn\u2019t ask the obvious. It wasn\u2019t any of her business. She really didn\u2019t want to know who Rusty was anyway.</p><p>Rusty leaned over conspiratorially. \u201cI\u2019m the stray. Marlene sort of adopted me. Not that you could possibly think I sprang from the same gene patch as that bunch.\u201d She jerked her thumb over her shoulder in Sam, Garrett and Donovan\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cZip it, Rusty,\u201d Sean snapped. \u201cThe last thing we need is your mouth today.\u201d</p><p>Sophie looked in surprise at the young sheriff\u2019s deputy standing across the room.</p><p>Rusty curled her lip in Sean\u2019s direction. \u201cI don\u2019t answer to you, copper. Go eat a donut or something.\u201d</p><p>Rusty turned back to Sophie and rolled her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s another stray Marlene picked up. Though personally I think he\u2019s worn out his welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRusty,\u201d Frank said in his gravelly voice. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, young lady.\u201d</p><p>To Sophie\u2019s surprise, Rusty shut up and straightened in her seat. Sophie could swear there was genuine respect and affection in the young girl\u2019s eyes when she looked at the Kelly patriarch.</p><p>Sophie was less sure of Frank. He watched her. He\u2019d watched her ever since Sam had deposited her on the couch. There was nothing accusatory in his stare, but he studied her intently nonetheless and it made her uncomfortable.</p><p>She could only imagine the assumptions that were being made. She could name several, but there was no use in torturing herself. The assumptions were deserved, and she didn\u2019t have the mental energy or the desire to correct any of them.</p><p>\u201cAre you through, hon?\u201d</p><p>Sophie blinked and looked up to see Marlene standing in front of her, her hands outstretched to take the tray.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, Mrs. Kelly. I appreciate the food. It was wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Marlene smiled warmly. \u201cSuch a polite young woman. But please, call me Marlene. No one calls me Mrs. Kelly, well unless they\u2019re telemarketers. Most folks just call me Marlene or Mom.\u201d</p><p>She took the tray and Sophie listed to the side, no longer able to keep her head up. Sam had put several pillows behind her and to the side and she snuggled under the warm quilt. No one seemed to be paying her much attention now, so she drifted, barely listening to what was going on around her.</p><p>SAM watched as Sophie\u2019s head dipped lower and lower, until her cheek nestled against the pillow. His mother was also watching, and as soon as Sophie\u2019s eyes closed, she marched across the room, her eyes narrowed and fixed on him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me what on earth is going on here,\u201d she said in a low, determined voice. \u201cAnd I want all of it, not the watered-down version your brothers already gave me.\u201d</p><p>Sam expelled his breath in a long sigh. He rubbed his hand tiredly through his hair and glanced up to see his dad looking at him with the same intensity that was in his mother\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s carrying my grandchild,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>Trust Dad to get straight to the point. He never was one for pussyfooting around.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very likely she\u2019s carrying my child,\u201d Sam said carefully.</p><p>Marlene frowned. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you know?\u201d She glanced back at Sophie, her frown deepening.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go jumping to conclusions, Ma. And don\u2019t think badly of Sophie. Not yet. There\u2019s too much I don\u2019t know. She deserves the benefit of the doubt until I find out what the hell is going on here.\u201d</p><p>If that didn\u2019t make him a flaming hypocrite, he didn\u2019t know what did. He didn\u2019t want anyone else disrespecting her or developing a bad opinion, but it didn\u2019t stop him from being suspicious and cautious with her.</p><p>He\u2019d recognized early on that she had a lot of power where he was concerned, and that didn\u2019t sit well with him at all.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what you know,\u201d Marlene said fiercely.</p><p>Knowing it wasn\u2019t going to make him look good in front of his parents, he still told them the unvarnished truth about his mission to Mexico and his involvement with Sophie. He left out the part about killing the assassin, but judging by the look on his dad\u2019s face, he\u2019d figured out that much. No need to horrify his mother more than necessary.</p><p>\u201cNow listen to me, Ma,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThis is serious. Our entire family could be in danger. I need you and Dad to do exactly what I tell you. No arguing.\u201d He looked pointedly at his father. \u201cI can\u2019t do my job if I\u2019m worried that you aren\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>Frank put his arm around Marlene and drew her into his side. \u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d</p><p>Sean, who\u2019d been standing just to the side, walked forward so he could be included in the conversation.</p><p>\u201cMy teams are due to arrive shortly. One will be assigned solely to keep you safe. All of you. No one moves without my men\u2019s say-so, and that includes Rusty.\u201d</p><p>Sean scowled. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the little twit in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d Marlene admonished with a sharp frown.</p><p>Sean\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.</p><p>\u201cUntil this is resolved, everyone will have to sit tight.\u201d</p><p>Frank cast a look over at Sophie. \u201cWhat about you and Sophie? What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, we have a problem.\u201d</p><p>Sam turned to see Donovan standing behind him, holding the KGI secure phone in his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cResnick just buzzed me wanting to know why we were accessing their files on Mouton\u2019s assassin.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhat on earth for? Not like we don\u2019t rifle through their database all the time. You didn\u2019t hack into any classified shit, did you?\u201d</p><p>Donovan didn\u2019t even respond to the crack. \u201cHe wants to talk to you ASAP.\u201d</p><p>Apprehension seeped down his neck. The last thing they needed was Resnick poking his nose into this.</p><p>Glancing apologetically at his mom and dad and Sean, Sam walked back into the kitchen with Donovan on his heels. Garrett must have seen the exodus, because he appeared just seconds behind them.</p><p>Sam took the phone from Donovan and put it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cResnick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, what the hell\u2019s going on down there? What is Mouton\u2019s assassin doing in your neck of the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you could tell me.\u201d</p><p>Resnick snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t play that game with me. Mouton\u2019s daughter\u2019s gone missing. Any chance she\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned and turned so he could look at his brothers. \u201cWhy would the CIA be interested in Mouton\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to answer questions, Sam. I\u2019m here to ask them.\u201d</p><p>Anger fizzed through Sam\u2019s blood, and he gripped the phone tighter. \u201cListen to me. I\u2019m not playing games here. That bastard is after my family. I don\u2019t give a damn about the CIA right now, you got me? This will be your only heads-up. I\u2019m going to do what I need to do to ensure he never touches anyone close to me. The best thing you can do is stay the hell out of my way.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence. \u201cSam, I need to talk to her. It\u2019s important. If she\u2019s with you, we need to question her. Mouton\u2019s missing too. He hasn\u2019t been spotted since KGI took down that arms shipment five months ago. We think . . . we think he was working with plutonium and that he had a supply. His scientists were working on a way to store it for longer periods of time in a stable environment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Why the hell do you think she\u2019d know anything about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But she disappeared the same time he disappeared, and his brother has expended a lot of resources in his search for the daughter and suddenly an assassin turns up on your doorstep? He wants her back for a reason. I\u2019m thinking maybe she either has something they want or she has information they don\u2019t want getting out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck finding her then,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Resnick swore long and violently. \u201cGoddamn it, Sam. Work with me here. Don\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m an idiot. Set up a meeting for me. You choose the location. I\u2019ll come alone. You have my word. This is too important. If Mouton has his hands on plutonium, a lot of people are going to die.\u201d</p><p>Sam rubbed his palm over his face and closed his eyes as the throb of a headache began at the base of his skull. Was Sophie still hiding shit from him? Had she been truthful about anything?</p><p>He glanced at his brothers to see both staring hard at him, questions in their eyes. Holding their gaze, he finally spoke back into the phone.</p><p>\u201cOnly you, Resnick. You break your word, you\u2019ll never get another goddamn thing from KGI. We clear? I\u2019ll call you with location and time.\u201d</p><p>Before Resnick could respond, Sam disconnected and slapped the phone onto the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d Garrett demanded.</p><p>\u201cResnick wants to question Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Donovan asked.</p><p>\u201cApparently Mouton has gone underground. The brother appears to be running things, which explains why his personal bodyguard came and not one of Mouton\u2019s. He disappeared the same day Sophie did her flit. The CIA has a hard-on for Sophie. They think she can give them information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re agreeing to the meet,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cYeah, I am. No point in pissing off Resnick. I want information too. If she\u2019s holding out on us, we need to know. I\u2019m not taking any chances with those bastards and our family.\u201d</p><p>Both Garrett and Donovan nodded their agreement.</p><p>Sam checked his watch. \u201cThe teams will be here soon.

Van can stay with Mom and Dad. I\u2019m going with you and Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Let\u2019s figure out where the fuck we set up the meet and greet with Resnick.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>WHEN Sophie awoke, the living room was filled with strange men, all clad in black shirts and camo pants. They looked hard, not just muscled, but hard in the sense that they\u2019d seen and endured a lot.</p> <p>These were military men. Disciplined. More than just money guided their motivation. Their loyalty couldn\u2019t be bought as her father bought those loyal to him.</p><p>Her thoughts were fanciful. She didn\u2019t know any of this for a fact. Maybe they weren\u2019t any better than her father, but she had to believe in something, and right now she chose to believe in Sam, and by default the men who worked with and for him.</p><p>Fascinated by the lone woman in the group\u2014they called her P.J.\u2014Sophie watched her interact from the safety of her blankets and mound of pillows. No one had noticed she was awake, and she was quite happy to observe in silence.</p><p>P.J. was small and surprisingly feminine-looking, or maybe it was because she was surrounded by much larger, terse males. She was quite pretty in an understated way. She had a tan that testified to time spent outdoors. Her hair was pulled back in a neat ponytail, simple and no nonsense, just like she appeared. Her eyes, though, were a clear shade of green, beautiful enough that Sophie found herself staring unabashedly at the fascinating woman.</p><p>She too was dressed in a black T-shirt and camo pants. A large knife was secured to her belt, and she wore a shoulder holster with a pistol tucked under her arm.</p> <p>Sophie felt a rush of envy. Here was a woman who was wholly self-sufficient. She didn\u2019t need the men who surrounded her. She was obviously an equal, and she could take care of herself. These men trusted her to look out not only for herself but for the team as well.</p><p>P.J. wouldn\u2019t have run scared like Sophie had done. Nor would she have made such a pitiful attempt at escaping Tomas\u2019s assassin.</p><p>She glanced down at her hands and almost laughed. It was rather pointless to be comparing herself to a female mercenary. Though she did wonder about P.J.\u2019s story. How awesome that she had choices, that she could do and be anything. She was in control of her own destiny.</p><p>So were about a billion other people on the planet, and now so would Sophie be. No longer would she be controlled by another human being. It was a vow she repeated often.</p><p>Her gaze drifted to where Marlene and Frank sat in the corner of the room. Marlene was on Frank\u2019s lap, and he had a firm arm around her. They were talking in low tones, and it was obvious Frank was comforting her. Every once in a while Marlene\u2019s worried gaze would seek out her sons, but there was also fierce pride reflected there. And love.</p><p>It made Sophie\u2019s chest ache. It hurt to see such love, such a sense of family in this sprawling house. Pictures and memories littered the walls and the mantel over the fireplace. Occupied every available space on the surface of end tables and over the television.</p> <p>It was everything she\u2019d ever wanted and never had.</p><p>The baby kicked, just one gentle nudge, like she was turning over to a better position in her sleep. Tears burned Sophie\u2019s lids. Already she loved her daughter so much, and she vowed with everything she had that somehow, someway, her child would grow up with the love and security that Sophie never enjoyed.</p><p>She had no experience. But she had dreams. She had imagined a thousand times how normal families lived and loved. She wanted that for her daughter.</p><p>She wanted it for herself.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She jerked her head up to see a tall, dark-haired man\u2014Rio?\u2014standing over her. She froze as she studied him. He looked fierce, but there was something soft in his eyes as he stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cYou looked upset.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat nervously. She wasn\u2019t sure what to say, or if she should say anything at all. This might be one of Sam\u2019s men, but that didn\u2019t automatically give him a pass.</p> <p>Then he smiled, and white teeth flashed. \u201cYou remind me of my little sister. Magdalena was her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d</p><p>It came out little more than a whisper, and when pain flashed in his dark eyes, she regretted making the distinction.</p><p>\u201cShe passed on a few years ago. She was pregnant like you. And just as beautiful. Pregnancy does that for a woman.\u201d</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t know what to say or how to respond, so she said nothing. To her surprise, Rio held out a glass of iced tea and carefully put it into her hand.</p><p>Touched by the gesture, she gave him a genuine smile and raised the glass to her lips. \u201cThank you. Who are all these people?\u201d she asked, looking beyond him to the others.</p><p>He glanced over as she did. \u201cThe man standing to Sam\u2019s right is Steele, the other team leader. I\u2019m Rio, by the way. My team is standing to the side. All this togetherness isn\u2019t really our thing.\u201d</p><p>She followed his direction to a group of five men standing silently with no expression. They merely observed. She shivered. They looked dangerous.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Cole and P.J. with Donovan. They\u2019re the two sharpshooters. They both belong to Steele. On the other side of them are Baker, Renshaw and Dolphin.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head to look at Rio. \u201cDolphin?\u201d</p><p>Rio grinned. \u201cBecause he swims like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being nice to me?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>His eyebrow went up and he studied her for a moment. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe you\u2019re used to people not being very nice to you. Maybe it\u2019s time to alter your expectations, hmm?\u201d</p><p>He offered a smile, then returned to where his men stood. He leaned against the wall, propping one foot behind him, and stared at Sam and Steele with a bored expression on his face.</p><p>Every once in a while he looked back over at her and smiled. He had no idea how much that small gesture meant to her in a room filled with people she didn\u2019t know or trust. It gave her something to grasp. He may not like her or trust her\u2014she doubted either\u2014but he was nice to her and he didn\u2019t have to be. How silly\u2014but unsurprising\u2014that she was such a weak sucker for someone showing her any sort of kindness.</p><p>She was already firmly under the spell of Marlene Kelly, and for all she knew, the woman had changed her mind about her the moment Sam gave her the story.</p><p>Talk of safe houses and leaving turned Sophie in Sam\u2019s direction. He was speaking to Steele, and Rio had closed in on the small circle of men surrounding Sam. Garrett and Donovan stood on either side of Sam, and she was struck by how fierce their expressions were.</p><p>She struggled to lean forward so she could hear, and Marlene and Sam both saw her at the same time. Sam turned in her direction, going silent as his gaze roved over her. Marlene left the shelter of her husband\u2019s arms and slid onto the couch next to Sophie.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, dear?\u201d Marlene asked as she laid a hand on Sophie\u2019s arm.</p><p>Not wanting to be rude, she yanked her gaze from Sam and turned to Marlene.</p><p>\u201cBetter. The bath and the food did wonders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hurting? Do you want some more pain medicine?\u201d</p><p>Sophie paused, realizing she hadn\u2019t given her shoulder any thought. She hadn\u2019t awakened with the vicious ache. Tentatively she tested her motion, raising her arm at an angle.</p><p>She winced and immediately dropped it back to her side.</p><p>Before she could respond to Marlene, Sam was next to her, his eyes flashing with disapproval.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move your arm more than necessary. You don\u2019t want to open those stitches.\u201d He glanced over at Donovan. \u201cVan, you want to take another look before we bug out?\u201d</p><p>Sophie blinked in confusion and then looked between Sam and his mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Sam. He just looked at it, and I haven\u2019t so much as moved it until just a second ago. It wasn\u2019t even hurting until I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell don\u2019t move it then,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d she asked. The idea of him going sent panic up her spine.</p><p>His eyes narrowed and then he blinked. \u201cDid you think I was leaving you? You\u2019re coming with me, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Her lips rounded to an O. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>She was so relieved that her head was slightly swimmy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have plenty of time to discuss that on the road. Sit tight here with Mom while I get all the details worked out with my men.\u201d</p><p>He touched her hand briefly as he rose, but warmth traveled her entire body. He glanced one more time at her before returning to his men.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can get you?\u201d Marlene asked.</p><p>Sophie shook her head and focused on Sam. She wanted to hear what he had to say and find out what his plan was. She\u2019d needed the sleep, but now she was at a disadvantage. She\u2019d missed a lot while she dozed.</p><p>\u201cRio, I want you to bug out with Mom, Dad and Rusty. Donovan\u2019s staying with you. Stay low until you hear from me. Steele, you\u2019ll pull recon at Eagle One with Cole, P.J. and Dolphin. When you give me the all clear, I\u2019ll bring Sophie in. I want Baker and Renshaw on the first plane to Hawaii to watch over Ethan and Rachel. I\u2019ll send Garrett to meet Resnick and bring him in. You\u2019ll maintain the perimeter at all times. I\u2019m not taking any chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Steele said.</p><p>It was the first time she\u2019d heard Steele say anything. He mostly stood and watched, his intense blue eyes taking in everything around him. He looked . . . cold and intimidating.</p><p>Instinctively she found Rio, and he flashed her a quick grin.</p><p>She wanted to interrupt and ask where the hell they were going, but she remained silent. She didn\u2019t want everyone\u2019s attention on her. Sam had promised to protect her and their child, and for now that was enough.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>\u201cSAM, I think Sophie should be examined by a doctor before you leave,\u201d Marlene said in a worried voice.</p><p>Sam looked down at his mom, who had her hand on his arm. \u201cVan checked her over, Ma. He stitched her wound and gave her antibiotics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Donovan isn\u2019t going with you. He\u2019s staying with us. Garrett isn\u2019t a medic and neither are you. Besides, what does Donovan know about pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned.</p><p>\u201cThis is your child, Sam,\u201d Marlene persisted. \u201cThis woman has been through hell. You need to make sure everything is all right with the baby.\u201d</p><p>Sam cupped the back of his neck and twisted his head from side to side. Fatigue and tension had a firm grip on him. \u201cI have to see to their safety, Ma. You know that. I can\u2019t let anything happen to them. We can\u2019t walk into a clinic even using a different identity. Her father would be on to us. I\u2019m sure he has a net several hundred miles wide around us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can have Doc come here to look at her. He\u2019s delivered more than one baby. He could at least listen to the heartbeat. And give her some vitamins. She should be taking vitamins.\u201d</p><p>His frown softened as he saw the very real worry in her eyes. He leaned down and hugged her tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her vitamins. I\u2019ll make sure she eats well. I\u2019ll take very good care of her. And as soon as possible, I\u2019ll get her to a doctor. You have my word. But I can\u2019t do it now. I can\u2019t take the risk and stay here any longer.\u201d</p><p>Marlene sighed and reached up to pat him on the cheek. He smiled at the gesture. It always made him feel like a boy again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my oldest, and I love you dearly but I have to say, you royally screwed up this time.\u201d</p><p>He blinked in surprise as she shook her head and pulled away. Then he laughed. There was nothing else to do. He was being taken to task like a teenager caught having sex in the backseat of his parents\u2019 car. At least then he\u2019d worn a condom.</p><p>Blowing out a weary breath, he turned to the others.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone ready to roll?\u201d He glanced over at his dad. \u201cAre you, Mom and Rusty packed?\u201d</p><p>His dad walked toward the kitchen. \u201cJust let me lock up the house and set the alarm.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded, not having the heart to tell his father that locks and an alarm wouldn\u2019t stop Mouton\u2019s men if they wanted to get in.</p><p>His mom hugged everyone, including making the rounds of his men. It was amusing to watch their discomfort over being fussed over by Marlene Kelly, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019d refuse her. She wasn\u2019t the type you refused.</p><p>Sophie watched from the sofa, and Sam could see pain that had nothing to do with her injuries deep in her eyes. He made his way over to her and reached for her hand. Her haunted gaze met his, and he squeezed her fingers, hoping to lighten some of the darkness he saw reflected on her face.</p><p>\u201cSit tight,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m going to take some pillows and blankets out to the SUV so you\u2019ll be comfortable. Garrett\u2019s going to drive, so I\u2019ll sit in the back with you.\u201d</p><p>Now that orders had been given, everyone split up and went their way. One of the two Kelly jets would fly Baker and Renshaw to Hawaii, while the other would take Steele, Dolphin, P.J. and Cole to West Virginia, where they\u2019d prepare Eagle One, one of the KGI safe houses, for Sam and Sophie\u2019s arrival. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Garrett slid into the driver\u2019s seat and looked over his shoulder at Sam, who was stuffing the back with the pillows for Sophie.</p><p>\u201cSo are you telling her what\u2019s going down?\u201d</p><p>Sam paused, then met Garrett\u2019s gaze. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Garrett raised a brow. \u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019ll see it as an ambush?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be pissed, man.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared back at his brother. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem concerned with pissing her off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with her either. And she\u2019s not carrying my child.\u201d</p><p>Sam punched one of the pillows, then withdrew from the back and stood by the door, his hand gripping the top of the window.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to be prepared for Resnick. If she\u2019s off guard, we might learn more. She\u2019s holding back. What, I\u2019m not sure, but she hasn\u2019t told us everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe agree on that much.\u201d</p><p>Sam watched as the vehicles bearing his family to safety filed out of the driveway, and then he went back into the house. He found Sophie standing in the living room in her sock feet. She looked nervous and lost.</p><p>For a moment self-disgust held him immobile. He was feeding her to the wolves. Not that he\u2019d allow Resnick to work her over, but he was taking Sophie into a situation with no warning. Yeah, it would work better that way, but he felt like an ass.</p><p>He had a family to protect, and he couldn\u2019t do that without all the information. Information he was positive Sophie held. If Resnick was that confident that Sophie was someone the CIA wanted to question, it stood to reason that she knew something.</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d</p> <p>She looked in his direction, and he could see the strain on her face. The deep sadness in her eyes hit him deep. He stepped forward, wanting to touch her. His fingers traced down her arm until he caught her fingers in his.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look so sad?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her lips trembled as she tried to smile. She looked away and stared around the room.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how lucky you are?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t at all what he\u2019d expected her to say.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>She tugged lightly with her hand, but he tightened his grip, refusing to let her move away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou have all of this.\u201d She gestured with her free hand, encompassing the room. \u201cYou have magic.\u201d</p> <p>Again her blue eyes stared up at him, and he was struck by the wash of emotion there. They shone with unshed tears and his gut tightened.</p><p>\u201cYou have a family. A history. It\u2019s so obvious that there\u2019s love here. It must have been wonderful to grow up in this house.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her carefully into his arms and tucked her head underneath his chin. He didn\u2019t know what to say to her other than to agree. What kind of childhood had she endured growing up under someone like Alex Mouton? And where was her mother? She hadn\u2019t said much about her mother at all, and none of his intel had ever mentioned a woman or a daughter.</p><p>Resnick had a lot to answer for. He\u2019d sent KGI in without important information. Like the fact that Mouton had a daughter. Sam damn sure wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved with Sophie if he\u2019d known that little fact. Looking back, he realized it had been damn convenient.</p><p>But here, now, with her in his arms, and feeling the kick of their child, it was easy to say he wouldn\u2019t have involved himself, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to regret it. Even if Sophie was firmly involved in her father\u2019s dealings. If nothing else, his child wouldn\u2019t live with the repercussions of her mother\u2019s or her grandfather\u2019s choices.</p><p>Surprising him, Sophie turned into his chest and hugged him fiercely. Slowly his arms came around her, and he held her there as she buried her face in his shoulder.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t at all sure what she needed from him. Oh, he could guess, but all he could offer was protection. He was determined to keep the rest of himself locked away\u2014at least until . . . what? She proved herself worthy?</p><p>The thought sickened him even as it took root in his mind. There was no way to sugarcoat what he was doing. He hated that he didn\u2019t trust her completely, but he\u2019d be an idiot to offer his faith blind. Too many people depended on him.</p><p>The sooner they met with Resnick, the sooner he could get on with the business of dispatching Mouton once and for all. Then maybe he and Sophie could work on the seemingly insurmountable obstacles between them.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he murmured into her hair. \u201cLet\u2019s get your shoes. Garrett\u2019s waiting. We need to get on the road.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask where they were going. She took his hand and let him lead her from the living room toward the front door.</p><p>Her trust humbled him and made the sick feeling in his stomach grow larger.</p><p>He was very afraid that when this was all over, he wouldn\u2019t have proven himself worthy to her.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of leaving you and Sophie alone,\u201d Garrett said as he navigated traffic through Nashville, toward the airport.</p><p>Sam leaned against the door, Sophie in his arms, her lower body sprawled across the seat. She\u2019d fallen asleep thirty miles out of Dover, and her soft, even breathing filled the back of the vehicle.</p><p>He absently ran his fingers through the strands of blond hair resting on her cheek as he stared back at Garrett\u2019s reflection in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to give Resnick our location. He was way too damn eager to know about Sophie. Given half a chance, he\u2019d bring in a team and take her. If you go and bring him in, I don\u2019t have to worry about that happening.\u201d</p><p>Garrett nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll make damn sure we aren\u2019t followed. If I have to drug and blindfold the fucker, he won\u2019t have a clue where I\u2019m taking him.\u201d</p><p>Garrett drove into the long-term parking lot and cut the engine. Sam gently touched Sophie on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cSophie, wake up. We\u2019re at the airport.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered and then popped open. She tried to rise, her movements awkward against him. He helped her to a sitting position, and she stared around, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cSam, I don\u2019t have any of my documents. My passport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not flying anywhere. Garrett is. But nobody has to know that. We\u2019re going to take a trip into the terminal and then you and I are going to slip back out and change vehicles.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhere is Garrett going?\u201d</p><p>Garrett glanced at Sam and then back at Sophie. \u201cJust a little fact-finding mission. I\u2019ll meet up with you two at Eagle One.\u201d</p><p>Sophie shook her head as if clearing the cobwebs as Sam helped her from the back of the SUV.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Eagle One? Everyone keeps talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of our safe houses,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>He tucked her elbow into his palm and directed her toward the elevator.</p><p>\u201cAct natural, Sophie. Smile. We don\u2019t want to draw any undue attention.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Sam and Sophie exited through the passenger pickup and got into a cab. He directed the driver to a location just outside the downtown area and then sat back and pulled Sophie to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurting?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head against the crook of his arm. \u201cI\u2019m feeling much better. I\u2019m hungry again, but I stay hungry these days.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and automatically glanced down at her belly, which was pressed to his side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you something to eat as soon as we\u2019re on our way again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t question him further. Didn\u2019t ask where they were going or how long it would take. She just settled against him and rested.</p><p>They got out of the cab, and Sam put Sophie into the front seat of a black Ford Expedition. Then he unlocked the back and pulled up the flooring to survey the small arsenal stashed there.</p><p>He holstered a Glock, popped the clip into one of the assault rifles, then pulled out the sat phone and a small GPS unit. He put the flooring back down and then walked back to get into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>Sophie\u2019s eyes widened briefly when she took in the rifle, but she didn\u2019t say a word as he laid it barrel-down between their seats.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going far today,\u201d he told her as he cranked the engine. \u201cI\u2019ve sent Steele and his team ahead to recon. We\u2019ll stay behind them until he gives me the all clear. Thought you might like hot food, a hot bath and a comfortable bed.\u201d</p><p>Her hands shook in her lap and she looked up at him, her eyes stark and hollow.</p><p>\u201cThat would be absolutely wonderful.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand, curling his fingers around hers as he pulled onto the highway. For a moment her hand lay limply in his, until finally she threaded her fingers tighter into his and held on.</p><p>THEY pulled into a roadside motel a few hours later. It wasn\u2019t the Ritz, but it wasn\u2019t a dive either. At the moment, Sophie didn\u2019t care as long as nothing crawled on her and it had running water and a decent bed. In fact, the bed didn\u2019t even have to be decent.</p><p>Surprisingly, she was pain-free, and she could actually move her arm in varying degrees without irritating her wound. She still ached from head to toe, but she was looser now, and if she could get another hot bath, it would go a long way in restoring her fortitude.</p><p>Sam returned with keys, and they walked to a room on the very end. The only suite the motel boasted, but it advertised a Jacuzzi tub, so she was all over that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll run you a bath, and you can soak while I order food. Do you have a preference?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cI\u2019ll get the bags out of the truck so you\u2019ll have clean clothes to change into.\u201d</p><p>Her brow crinkled. \u201cBags? We didn\u2019t bring any bags.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cTaken care of.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth gaped open. \u201cBut how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways pays to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. He was feeding her a line of crap. Someone had to have packed the truck for them. Probably one of his many team members.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll help you into the tub and then leave you to it,\u201d he said as he guided her toward the bathroom.</p><p>She stopped and put a hand on his arm. \u201cI can do it. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a moment, then nodded. \u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll take care of the bags and getting food.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t spend as much time in the tub as she had at Sam\u2019s mom and dad\u2019s. She could hear him outside the bathroom, and she was filled with a restless urgency to get back to him.</p><p>Other than stiffness and a little residual soreness, her wound didn\u2019t bother her as much as she had thought it would, given that she\u2019d been shot. She tested the ridge of the stitched seam with her fingers and examined it in the mirror. It was slightly puckered, a little swollen around the sutures, but there was no angry redness to denote infection. Those antibiotic shots Donovan had given her had done the trick.</p><p>She towel-dried her hair and then realized that Sam hadn\u2019t brought in a change of clothes for her. Her baggy pants and T-shirt lay on the floor soaking up the water she\u2019d dripped from the shower.</p><p>With a sigh, she wrapped a towel around her and cracked open the bathroom door. She didn\u2019t see Sam, so she pushed farther into the room, craning her neck to see around the doorway.</p><p>She saw Sam the same time he looked up and saw her. There was a spark in his eyes, and he quickly looked away but then lifted his gaze once more as if he couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>\u201cI uhm don\u2019t have any clothes,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He moved to the bed and rummaged in one of the bags there before pulling out a pair of jeans, underwear, and a shirt. He circled around the end of the bed and stalked toward her with purposeful steps.</p><p>She almost backed away. She felt small and vulnerable, and he was looking at her just like he\u2019d looked at her all those nights they\u2019d spent in another hotel.</p><p>He stopped just a foot in front of her, so close that his heat reached out and circled her like the damp towel she wore so close to her breast.</p><p>The clothes were in his hand, but he didn\u2019t move to give them to her and she didn\u2019t reach for them.</p><p>His gaze was so intense. So penetrating. She felt naked. So itchy and alive. She swallowed, but nothing she did ridded her of the knot in her throat. It ached like she ached.</p><p>The clothes dropped silently to the floor. His hands cupped her bare shoulders. His fingers caressed her skin.</p><p>Slowly and with infinite tenderness his mouth descended over hers. His breath danced across her skin, and then he captured her lips in a long, hot kiss. Time melted away like ice on a summer day. She was back in his arms in the hotel room where they met after she left the bar each night.</p><p>He\u2019d always waited for her, pulling her into his arms as soon as she walked through the door. Their clothes flew and they reacted desperately to the passion that existed between them.</p><p>She\u2019d give anything to go back to those precious nights she\u2019d spent in his arms. But she\u2019d always known she couldn\u2019t have forever.</p><p>Yet now, under the heat of his lips, she clung to him, wanting him so badly that the ache far surpassed the pain of her injuries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He jerked away and took a step back, running his hand through his hair in agitation. \u201cGoddamn it, Sophie. What you do to me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed and she stared at him, hoping he\u2019d shrivel under the force of her glare.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make you kiss me. You wanted me every bit as much as I wanted you. Don\u2019t make excuses. Shut up and take responsibility.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one eyebrow and then his gaze smoldered. He took a step forward, and she instinctively backed away.</p> <p>His hands smoothed up her shoulders, carefully skimming over her bandaged arm, until he cupped her face in his palms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll own up to the fact that right now I want to make love to you more than I want anything else. It\u2019s stupid. Insane, even, but there you have it. For now I\u2019ll take responsibility for the fact that I\u2019m going to kiss you again.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat just as his lips descended again. She melted into his arms, giving herself fully to his embrace.</p><p>A low moan rose from her throat, swelling painfully before it rushed into his mouth. She wanted to touch him, to hold him against her, to know that nothing bad would ever happen to her while she was in his arms.</p><p>\u201cTell me we can\u2019t make love, Soph,\u201d he murmured against her lips. The pet name he\u2019d used so many times when he was on top of her, inside her, beside her or wrapped around her, sounded so sweet to her ears. She was starved for him. \u201cThere\u2019s too much unresolved between us. We shouldn\u2019t\u2014we can\u2019t\u2014make love.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed unhappily and stared up at him as his thumbs caressed the corners of her mouth. Her face was still tenderly cupped in his hands, and she didn\u2019t want to break that connection for any reason.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much, Sam. I\u2019ve stayed awake so many nights aching for you to hold me again, to kiss me and make love to me like you did before.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and leaned in until his forehead rested against hers. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt. This is crazy.\u201d</p><p>She tilted back just enough that she could brush her lips over his. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Sam. I need you. Please say you\u2019ve thought about me even just once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>He sounded angry. He pulled away, his expression grim. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about you. I\u2019ve thought about you a hell of a lot more than once. I wish I hadn\u2019t. But goddamn it, you disappeared. I came back for you and you were gone.\u201d</p> <p>Pain\u2014worse than the knife\u2014sliced through her chest. Would things have been different if she had been there when he came back? Not that it had even been possible. She\u2019d made choices\u2014not difficult choices\u2014but she\u2019d made them, and now she had to live with the consequences.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about you too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAll the time.\u201d</p><p>She turned away and closed her eyes as helplessness fell over her. Regret knotted her throat into a tight channel. She squeezed air painfully past it until pain was all she could assimilate.</p><p>A knock sounded at the hotel door. Sam touched her shoulder then leaned down to retrieve her fallen clothes.</p><p>\u201cGo into the bathroom and get dressed. I\u2019ll get the food.\u201d</p><p>She reached for the clothes without looking at him. Then she retreated into the bathroom and closed the door. She leaned against the old wood, hating herself for the silent tears streaking down her cheeks.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go back. She wouldn\u2019t if she could. What was done was done, and the price she\u2019d paid was high. Maybe too high.</p><p>Wiping at her face with the back of her arm, she dropped the towel and sorted through the bundle of stuff Sam had given her. There were panties and a bra in the correct size. This time she snapped the clips on the bra and just pulled it over her head the best she could.</p> <p>A few minutes later, clean and attired in better fitting clothes, she took a deep breath and went back into the room.</p><p>The smell of food wafted through her nostrils and her mouth watered. There was an array of food spread out over the bed. A steaming pizza, two salads, a tray of cold cuts and cartons of Chinese takeout.</p><p>She stood at the side of the bed, not knowing where to start first.</p><p>\u201cDig in,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>He took a seat on the edge of the bed and picked up a slice of the pepperoni pizza.</p><p>\u201cI get half that,\u201d she said in a rush, pointing to the pizza.</p><p>He chuckled and picked up a paper plate to hand to her. \u201cTell you what. You get what you want. I\u2019ll take cleanup duty.\u201d</p><p>She took the plate and quickly went down the row piling food onto it. When she had no more room, she hesitated, studying to find what she could put back.</p><p>Sam laughed again and handed her another plate. \u201cIt\u2019s not going anywhere, Sophie. Sit down and eat.\u201d</p><p>Feeling like a moron, she edged onto the bed and shoved aside the tray of minisandwiches.</p><p>She attacked the pizza first because it was piping hot, and while lukewarm pizza was good, it was better when the cheese was all melty.</p><p>\u201cGod, this is good,\u201d she said on a moan.</p><p>He looked curiously at her. \u201cHow long has it been since you ate decently?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flamed. \u201cA few days. I didn\u2019t dare stop to eat. I was too busy trying to stay ahead of the people chasing me. But I\u2019d be starving anyway. I\u2019m not one of these dainty, delicate pregnant types. I think I could eat my weight at every meal. I\u2019ll be a walrus by the time I deliver.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slipped over her body, and she found herself blushing.</p><p>\u201cYou could certainly stand to gain a few pounds. Your belly pooches out like a volleyball. There\u2019s nothing else to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoobs,\u201d she mumbled around a second slice of pizza. \u201cBoobs are huge now. I hate it. I feel like I\u2019m incubating aliens and they\u2019re ready to hatch.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her in astonishment for a moment before throwing his head back to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI think the aliens are perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>She ate until she feared she was going to bust her gut. Her belly felt so tight that it was all she could do to move. She flopped back on the bed and closed her eyes, letting contentment wash over her.</p><p>Then she had to laugh because as contentment went, this wasn\u2019t exactly ideal. She was stuck on the run in a motel, with a man she lusted over with every girly hormone in her pregnant body. A man whose child she was carrying. A man who didn\u2019t trust her and seemed to fight with himself over whether he liked her or didn\u2019t like her.</p><p>Then there was the fact that her uncle\u2019s men were breathing down her neck, she\u2019d killed her father, and she\u2019d stolen access to his entire fortune.</p><p>When she fucked up, she went whole hog.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing, Sam?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. A KGI safe house.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of frustration. \u201cAnd what happens then? You can\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t have a plan. Where do I fit in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d protect you and our child,\u201d he said in an even tone. A tone that could have been used with anyone. A tone that told her he wasn\u2019t giving anything away.</p><p>She rolled away and got awkwardly from the bed. She went to the window because there was nowhere else to go. Her fingers curled and uncurled, denting her palm when her nails dug into her skin.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me anything?\u201d</p><p>She hated the pleading sound of her own voice. It sounded needy and pathetic. Where was the woman who\u2019d coldly planned her father\u2019s murder and her escape?</p><p>She dropped her head down, regretting that she\u2019d conjured the image of her father slipping to the floor, his blood running over the polished floor.</p><p>She may have hated the bastard, but the idea that she\u2019d so easily pulled the trigger frightened her. Was she more like him than she thought?</p><p>\u201cCome to bed, Soph.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s low voice fluttered across her neck, so soft and entreating. She shivered and clutched her arms protectively over her chest.</p><p>His hands slid over her shoulders and he pulled her back against him. Then his lips whispered just below her ear. A simple, delicate kiss that conveyed more than words the heavy regret between them.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed,\u201d he said again.</p><p>She let him lead her away from the window. The food was gone and the covers were pulled back. He kept his gaze down, but he carefully eased her down onto the mattress before tucking her in as he would a child.</p><p>Without undressing, he walked around the foot of the bed and to the other side, where he slid in next to her. His warmth enveloped her even before he pushed up against her.</p><p>For a moment she resisted and lay stiffly as he tucked her against his body, but then, unable to resist, she relaxed and snuggled readily into his embrace.</p><p>Right now she didn\u2019t care what he thought of her. For the moment she was safe, even if it was just an illusion. Their child rolled and bumped between them, and her throat tightened at the fantasy of how it could have been if she wasn\u2019t who she was and he wasn\u2019t who he was.</p><p>They could be regular people celebrating the life of a child and their first foray into parenting. He could read pregnancy books and worry endlessly over whether she was eating properly.</p><p>He\u2019d be there for each kick and wiggle, and they\u2019d stay up late at night talking about names and make wishes for the future.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>His name spilled from her lips. She had so much to explain. She didn\u2019t even know where to start, but she could take the tension between them no longer.</p><p>\u201cShhh. Not now, Soph,\u201d he said in a quiet voice. \u201cJust let it be. Sleep now. Our child needs your strength.\u201d</p><p>With a resigned sigh, she closed her eyes.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>SOPHIE woke to warm, sensual lips sliding up the side of her neck. She shivered as Sam\u2019s tongue traced the shell of her ear and lingered at the lobe long enough for him to nip it with his teeth.</p><p>The covers had been thrown aside, and his palm skimmed up her leg, pushing the oversized shirt over her hip to gather at her waist.</p><p>She sucked in her breath. Had she taken off her pants during the course of the night? She was lying there in only her panties and a shirt, and Sam\u2019s hands were fast making work of the shirt.</p><p>Or maybe he was just that good.</p><p>In past times, he would already have been over her, inside her, waking her to the feel of his cock stretching her and setting fire to her nerve endings. But this morning he was tentative. Seeking . . . permission? Her acquiescence?</p><p>Her body throbbed. A pulse thrummed in her groin, and already she was swollen and wet for him. She loved his touch. Even at his gentlest, he was strong and masterful. She\u2019d been drawn to his strength when she had cause to fear everything else in the world.</p><p>He made her feel protected and cherished.</p><p>But now?</p><p>Her brain hurt trying to decipher where they stood. If they stood anywhere at all. She couldn\u2019t even look back at what they\u2019d had because what they\u2019d had wasn\u2019t real. It was built on lies and half-truths.</p><p>His hand slid over her belly and cupped their child as if bringing home the one thing they did have. They\u2019d created a very precious life. She was very real.</p><p>He kissed her again, just one touch against the pulse at her neck. His body pressed into the curve of her behind. His erection was hot and turgid, pulsing against her skin. Chill bumps dotted her hip and spread rapidly down her legs.</p><p>\u201cYou said we couldn\u2019t,\u201d she said without conviction.</p><p>He moved his hand up to cup her breast, and he kneaded gently, working the nipple between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you more sensitive here now?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She nodded, unable to speak around the tightening of her throat.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be extra careful.\u201d</p><p>He touched and stroked, alternating until her nipples were stiff peaks, erect and so hard that they hurt. The simplest brush across the points sent a current of desire streaking through her abdomen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take your shirt off. Just lie still. Let me do the work. I don\u2019t want you to hurt your arm.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the raw sensuality in his voice. Lowtimbred, husky, with just a bit of a rasp. It always got low and gravelly when they made love.</p><p>Oh God, they were going to make love.</p><p>He eased the shirt farther up, until it gathered around her neck. He stretched the armhole until he could slip it around her elbow. There was only a twinge as he pulled it the rest of the way up and over her arm.</p><p>\u201cLift your head for just a second, honey.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, she was free of the material, and she was down to her underwear.</p><p>He rose up on his elbow, and she turned her head so she could see him. He simply watched her, his gaze drifting up and down her body with lazy strokes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so unbelievably beautiful,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>She swallowed. She didn\u2019t want to ruin the moment, but she had to know what had changed. Why was he willing to make love to her now?</p><p>\u201cYou said we couldn\u2019t,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut right now I can\u2019t think of a single reason why we can\u2019t. I want you, Sophie. I missed you. I can\u2019t lie here without touching you. I want what\u2019s mine again. I want to give you what\u2019s yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her chest fluttered, then grew tight. Her stomach flipped and she began to shake.</p><p>\u201cShhh, baby,\u201d he said as he stroked down the curve of her body. \u201cJust let me love you. We\u2019ll figure this all out, Sophie. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hate me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened, and he leaned down to kiss her hip right above the band of her panties.</p> <p>\u201cI feel a lot of things for you, Sophie. But hate isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>His thumb hooked into her underwear, and he carefully slid it down leaving her naked and vulnerable to his touch and sight.</p><p>Her hand fluttered over her belly, and she turned her face into the pillow, no longer able to bear his scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea just how beautiful you are?\u201d</p><p>There was awe and reverence in his voice that had her looking back at him. It was there in his eyes as he simply stared down at her.</p> <p>He bent and kissed her hip again and then showered a line of kisses down her leg to her ankle. He lifted her foot and kissed each toe until she twitched at the ticklish sensations.</p><p>He eased her foot down and moved behind her again. He lay down, his mouth close to her neck as he spooned against her. Her buttocks cupped his erection, and she moaned in anticipation.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move her. Didn\u2019t turn her over. He simply lifted her leg and eased it back over his until she was open and bare. His cock lay between her legs, but it was his fingers that found her heat.</p><p>\u201cSam ...\u201d she whispered as he stroked the soft folds.</p><p>He parted them and dipped one finger inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hot and wet and so damn tight,\u201d he said in a near groan.</p> <p>Another finger slipped inside her, and she arched helplessly. She wouldn\u2019t last. Her body was painfully aware of him. She wanted him with every breath. She turned her head, and her cheek met his lips. He kissed her. The sweetness of that one kiss melted her senses and sent a trembling awakening through her heart.</p><p>How could she love someone she was so unsure of?</p><p>Sudden tears flooded her eyes. She blinked furiously, angry that she would be so weak at such a vulnerable moment.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she choked out. \u201cPlease, Sam. I need you.\u201d</p><p>He paused for just a moment, and a low shudder worked its way through his body, pressing into her. She could feel his energy and his reaction to her soft plea.</p><p>His fingers left her to grasp his cock. He positioned himself at her entrance and then found her ear with his lips. One kiss. Two. And then he murmured low and sweet.</p><p>\u201cJust relax, baby. Let me take you this way so you don\u2019t have to move. Let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>He nudged forward, his hips pressing into her buttocks as he breached the tight clasp of her heat. She sucked in her breath, then closed her eyes when his shallow thrust sent streaks of pleasure through her pussy.</p> <p>Back and forth. He rocked against her slow and measured, none of his thrusts going too deep. His hand left his cock now that he had position, and he laid it possessively over her hip. His fingers curled into her, holding her as he moved faster now but still as carefully as before.</p><p>He was driving her crazy. She flexed and pushed back, eager to meet his movements, but he gripped her hip and held her in place.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>Her leg lay over his, and she tucked her foot between his legs, enjoying the rasp of hair on her bare skin. His legs were muscled, lean and so strong. They flexed and twitched with each forward thrust.</p><p>Then his hand moved from her hip and eased underneath her leg, pushing it upward to give him room. He supported her thigh with his forearm and reached up until his fingers found her clitoris.</p><p>His thumb teased the entrance his cock rubbed back and forth over, while his fingers parted the soft flesh above and tenderly stroked the stiff, sensitive bundle of nerves at her center.</p><p>No longer able to lie still, she tightened and bucked back against him.</p><p>His thrusts got stronger, and he sank deeper, until her buttocks were flat against his abdomen.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, honey? Go with me. Come with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one more second,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>She closed her eyes and rocked against him. His fingers grew more assertive, and he moved his thumb up to roll over her clit in a demand for her to respond.</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh my God, yes. Just like that, Sam. Don\u2019t stop please. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>She was pleading. Her voice was hoarse and needy, and each demand came out in a short burst of air.</p><p>He drew back and then pumped deep just as his thumb rolled in a tight circle.</p><p>She cried out and tensed. Her fingers curled into balls, into fists so tight that her hands shook with the strain. Cascades of color flashed, little and big spots that floated through her vision even when she closed her eyes.</p><p>Sam was thrusting hard and fast now as he sought his own release. His hoarse shouts mixed with her agonized sounds. It sounded as though she was in the worst sort of pain, but the pleasure, ah the pleasure, was so intense, so beautiful that she didn\u2019t want it to end.</p><p>She reached down to still his hand when the sensation became too intense to bear. He eased his thumb away but continued a gentle rocking motion that sent his cock gliding through tissues slick with his release.</p><p>Finally he stopped, lodged deep within her. She didn\u2019t move for fear of displacing him, and she lay there simply enjoying the feeling of being so intimately connected to this man.</p><p>He kissed her back, rubbed his thumb in circles around the ball of her shoulder and then kissed her again, his erratic breaths sending goose bumps over her skin.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>His voice was quiet and regretful, as if he had no liking for the admission and hated voicing it even more. She wondered why he\u2019d been honest; maybe he too was tired of all the deceit between them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t explain it. Not sure I want to, but damn it, I need you, Sophie. It\u2019s not just physical. It can\u2019t be. I\u2019ve had physical before.\u201d</p><p>He moved slightly, and for a moment she feared he was pulling out of her, but he stayed locked tight, their bodies joined as he shifted closer to her.</p><p>He slid his hand over her waist and splayed his fingers over her belly. His grip was possessive and tender and told her more than words that he was claiming what was his.</p><p>He continued to pet and stroke her belly, his touch light and soothing. He rested his mouth on her shoulder, and neither spoke. She floated on a cloud between sleep and awake, existing in a state of delicious lethargy. Finally she dozed, and only came awake when she felt him finally pull away in a warm rush of fluid.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d he said.</p><p>He returned with a warm towel and gently cleaned between her legs. Then he settled next to her in bed once more and pulled her in close to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have to leave?\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. My team will notify me when it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>She stirred and frowned. \u201cAre we safe here, just us?\u201d</p><p>She felt him smile against her neck.</p><p>\u201cYes, Soph, we\u2019re safe. I wouldn\u2019t risk you or our baby. I\u2019ll know if anyone steps within ten feet of our door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked drowsily.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cSecurity. I did a lot while you were taking your bath. Sleep now and don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d</p><p>She sighed as some of the postcoital euphoria faded. It was hard not to worry when she faced so much uncertainty. She still hadn\u2019t told him everything, and when he knew, he might not want anything to do with her.</p><p>He hated her father, and if the apple didn\u2019t fall very far from the tree, she couldn\u2019t imagine Sam being overjoyed with spending time with her, loving her or allowing his child to be raised by a monster.</p><p>Fear churned in her stomach until she was sucking deep breaths through her nose to quiet the nausea. He couldn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t take her child from her.</p><p>She closed her eyes. She was being an idiot. Nothing of the sort was going to happen. She just had to be careful, pick the right time and make sure her uncle never got close.</p><p>And the last she couldn\u2019t do without Sam.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>SAM woke to a warm, sweet body sprawled across him and a tiny pitter-patter thumping him in the side. It took him a moment to process that it was his child kicking him.</p><p>He smiled and slid his hand down Sophie\u2019s spine, down to cup her plump little rear as he lay there soaking up the utter domesticity of the scene.</p><p>His woman, limp and sated, draped across him in a possessive manner that gave him a ridiculous sense of satisfaction, and his child, waking him up with a tiny foot to his gut.</p><p>If the little imp was anything like her mama, he was in for a hell of a ride.</p><p>As he continued to caress her behind, she stirred and murmured something against his neck before burrowing deeper into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked against her ear.</p><p>\u201cShower,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI need one. But God, I don\u2019t want to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his hold on her, content to stay just like this. He raised his hand from her hip to check his watch and then lazily trailed his fingers down to the cleft of her ass.</p><p>Chill bumps raced across her back, and he soothed them away with his palm. For a long moment, she lay there, the only sound her soft breathing against his neck.</p><p>Yeah, he liked it. He\u2019d liked it five months ago and he liked it now.</p><p>Finally she shoved herself up, and her blond hair spilled over his chin. To his surprise, she leaned down and kissed him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a tentative brush but a hot, open-mouthed kiss that sent a surge of electricity through his body.</p><p>She drew away, and her pupils dilated until there was only a thin ring of blue around the black. She laid her palm over his jaw and let her thumb glide across his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you tie me up before?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat time in the hotel. You tied me up.\u201d</p><p>His chest shook as laughter escaped. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It seemed like the thing to do at the time. Maybe I\u2019m a kinky bastard. Did you like it?\u201d</p><p>She seemed to think about it as she cocked her head to the side.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He leaned up and kissed her quickly on the mouth.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I\u2019ll do it again sometime.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and went even darker. He smiled. Oh yeah, she\u2019d liked it. The thing was, he didn\u2019t really know why he\u2019d done it. At the time he\u2019d wanted her completely at his mercy, and the idea of her tied to his bed had been a huge turn-on. Not that he needed much encouragement around her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m really going to take a shower now,\u201d she said.</p><p>She tried to push away, but he caught her against him and then rolled with her until he was over her, staring down into wide swirls of blue.</p><p>His cock ached like a son of a bitch, and when she squirmed, the tip brushed through swollen, damp folds. He groaned and pushed, forcing his way through tight, liquid heat. She gasped and surged upward.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThis is going to be quick.\u201d</p><p>He thrust and felt his skin peel away, leaving him raw and exposed. He tried to be gentle. He needed to be gentle, now of all times, when she was still sleepy and unprepared, but her channel hugged him, had a stranglehold on his cock.</p><p>Her nails scoured his back and then dug in. He thrust and rocked, and she opened her legs wider to take him.</p><p>When she whispered his name in sweet, husky acceptance, he lost it. He came apart while she held him. Her hands, like little feathers, whispered up and down his back.</p><p>He swallowed and tried to regain his composure, but he felt shattered by this one, quick encounter. He shook almost uncontrollably and went suddenly weak.</p><p>He lowered himself to her, and she enveloped him in her embrace. He buried his face against her neck and inhaled her feminine scent.</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head until her lips met the skin behind his ear. She kissed, just once, and whispered softly, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry for wanting me, Sam.\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself up. \u201cNever that. I\u2019m just sorry I was such an inconsiderate asshole.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cCome take a shower with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo soak in the tub today?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo just a quick shower and then you can feed me again. When will we have to leave?\u201d</p><p>He checked his watch, wondering the same thing.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead to the shower. I\u2019ll call and check in, make sure everything\u2019s going according to plan.\u201d</p><p>He carefully pulled himself away and then reached a hand to help her out of bed. He watched her walk into the bathroom, mesmerized by the gentle sway of her ass.</p><p>She was one beautiful pregnant woman. He\u2019d always thought that pregnant women were beautiful. He loved to look at them, at the swollen lushness of their bodies, the spark in their eyes, and imagine the softness of their skin. But nothing had prepared him for the reality of a woman pregnant with his child.</p><p>He shook himself back to awareness. The devil of it was he knew he was on a clear collision course with something he wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with, but at the moment he didn\u2019t care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He only knew that somehow, someway, he had to sort all of this out. Not only was he not letting go of his child, but he wasn\u2019t letting go of Sophie either. That was as far as he\u2019d thought, and he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to go any further.</p><p>SOPHIE walked out of the bathroom in bare feet, her hair still damp from the shower. She rubbed it with a towel as she glanced around for her shoes.</p><p>\u201cLooking for these?\u201d Sam asked as he tossed her tennis shoes onto the bed. \u201cWe need to get moving. We have a few hours on the road before we get to the safe house.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the towel and reached for a pair of socks that Sam had placed by the shoes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the rest of the stuff out of the bathroom and then we\u2019ll head out. I\u2019ve already got everything else.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and slipped on her shoes, quickly tying the laces. She was brimming with curiosity over this safe house. How long did Sam plan for them to stay? Did he intend to leave her there while he went after her uncle?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told her anything, but she wasn\u2019t an idiot. In his shoes, she\u2019d do the same thing. She wouldn\u2019t be sad to see the rest of her father\u2019s network taken down. Tomas was crippled because he didn\u2019t have the key that Sophie had stolen. His resources would be stretched, and he\u2019d just become more and more desperate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said as she stood to her full height again.</p><p>Sam ushered her out of the hotel, his gaze scanning the night around them. His body was tense and alert as he put her into the SUV. He even buckled her in before walking around to the driver\u2019s side. She smiled and shook her head. The man was conscientious. She\u2019d give him that much. He didn\u2019t do anything half-ass.</p> <p>He was intensely loyal to the people he loved. His family. His friends. If he gave even half that loyalty to their child, she\u2019d grow up the luckiest of little girls. But Sophie knew Sam would give his all. There would be no one more important to him than his child.</p><p>Her chest ached with sadness. What would it be like to have that kind of love and loyalty? She only hoped she could give what she\u2019d never been given. She hoped she knew how.</p><p>It didn\u2019t really matter whether nature prevailed over nurture or vice versa. She was fucked both ways.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be light soon,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe an hour. We\u2019ll roll in midmorning. Just in time for breakfast. I know you said you were hungry, but do you think you can wait a few hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was teasing you,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cI ate so much before that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be hungry for a week.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at her belly. \u201cUh-huh. I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s never wise to believe a pregnant woman when she says she\u2019ll never be hungry again.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed and enjoyed the sensation of feeling so light. It was absurd and incongruous given how they\u2019d come to be here and how tenuous her grip on the situation was. It had been too long since she\u2019d felt safe enough to enjoy a stolen moment where she didn\u2019t have to worry that taking joy in something meant its death or removal.</p><p>She looked away, embarrassed by the fact that she could so easily forget what was at stake here. She cleared her throat as if that somehow would make the feeling go away.</p><p>The sky turned lavender, and only one star hung stubbornly in it, bright like a diamond against velvet. Her gaze was fixed on the star, and she was unable to look away. Stars had always fascinated her. She\u2019d spent countless hours wishing on them as a child.</p><p>She\u2019d learned young that wishing was an exercise in futility, and that the only useful trait was self-reliance. She\u2019d spent years trying to make the wistful little girl inside disappear. At first she\u2019d been bent on protecting her, and then she\u2019d tried to ruthlessly drive her from existence.</p><p>The woman who\u2019d shot her father and felt no remorse was a long way from the child who\u2019d only ever wished for love and a family\u2014a real family.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about over there? You\u2019re about to chew your bottom lip off.\u201d</p><p>She immediately relaxed her mouth and managed a faint smile. \u201cNothing important. Tell me about KGI. How did you get it started and why do you do what you do? It seems an odd career choice.\u201d</p><p>He cast a sideways look at her and shrugged. \u201cIt pays well.\u201d</p> <p>She arched an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s it? It pays well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could say it\u2019s in the blood. My entire family is military. Never a time we weren\u2019t. My father, his father, his father\u2019s father. Uncles, cousins\u2014you name it, we served.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not still enlisted right? I mean KGI is private.\u201d</p><p>There was only a brief flicker in his eyes, and if she hadn\u2019t been watching she would have missed his hands tightening just a bit on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cYour father didn\u2019t tell you about us? You said he knew what we were.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cMy father only told me what he thought I needed to know in order to get close to you. He didn\u2019t give me your life story or anything.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back to the road. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not enlisted. I was an army man. Garrett and Donovan both joined the Marines. There\u2019s also Ethan, Nathan and Joe who you haven\u2019t met. Ethan was a Navy SEAL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas? So none of you are still in the military then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan and Joe are still active duty. Army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd does Ethan work with you?\u201d</p><p>Sam grimaced. \u201cSome. Probably more in the future. He and his wife have had a rough time. His focus is her right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I mean that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they need the time. They\u2019ll be fine though. Rachel\u2019s tough. She\u2019s a fighter.\u201d</p><p>Sophie looked at him curiously. A warm glint had entered his eyes when he spoke of his sister-in-law, and it made Sophie curious to know the story lurking behind those enigmatic words.</p><p>\u201cSo you formed KGI when you left the military? That seems like such a daunting undertaking. I can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled. \u201cNot so much. I had a lot of good contacts. I saved an upper-level CIA operative\u2019s ass during an incident at one of the U.S. embassies. He told me if he could ever return the favor to call him. So I did. Call him. It\u2019s through him that a lot of our jobs are done, but we take jobs in the private sector as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine normal, everyday people needing a military operation. Her father yes, but then he was as far from normal as one could get.</p><p>\u201cMost of our hostage recovery missions are contracted through governments and not always our own. We\u2019ve been hired by smaller countries without the military might of a more developed nation.</p><p>\u201cIn the private sector we\u2019ve taken jobs to recover kidnap victims and we\u2019ve also done fugitive recovery.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou mean like prison escapees?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNo, not quite. More like criminals who haven\u2019t been apprehended yet or are on the run before they\u2019ve been tried for their crimes. The job is a lot of things, but predictable and boring it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds very dangerous,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt can be, but we\u2019re good at what we do. We hire and train the best.\u201d</p><p>She grinned cheekily. \u201cYou sound like a commercial now.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and chucked her on the chin. \u201cNo one likes a smart-ass.\u201d</p><p>She caught his hand and kissed the tip of one finger. His eyes went molten, and for a moment he swerved as he took his attention from the road.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a menace,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Her eyes widened innocently. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and chuckled but faced the road and returned both hands to the wheel.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M in position,\u201d P.J. said into her receiver.</p><p>Out of habit, she took a wide, slow sweep from left to right with her scope and took in any potential problem areas.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a weak area to the west of the house. Three large trees connected by a mass of honeysuckle so thick you can\u2019t see through it. Someone could hide in there and never be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I break out the chain saw?\u201d Cole drawled.</p><p>P.J. rolled her eyes. \u201cYou probably couldn\u2019t handle that much power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you power,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cChildren,\u201d Dolphin reprimanded.</p><p>P.J. grinned and mentally counted to three. Yep, Steele broke in with his dry, no-sense-of-humor voice.</p><p>\u201cCut it, you two. We have a job to do here. I\u2019ll take a look at your problem spot, P.J.,\u201d Steele said. \u201cYou and Cole stay in position. Sam will be rolling in soon.\u201d</p><p>P.J. pulled her field glasses up and watched, curious as to whether she\u2019d actually be able to see Steele in the area. She knew she wouldn\u2019t, but it was a game she never tired of. The man couldn\u2019t always be that good, could he?</p><p>After several long minutes, Cole chuckled in her ear. \u201cYou won\u2019t find him, P.J.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cHow the hell do you know what I\u2019m doing? I know damn well you can\u2019t see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could mess with you and say I can, but you\u2019re predictable. I knew you\u2019d be looking.\u201d</p><p>Prompted by his needling to take him down a peg or two, she raised her rifle and did a meticulous sweep of the area where he\u2019d taken position. She\u2019d find his ass and nail it to the wall. Then he wouldn\u2019t be so smug.</p><p>It took several sweeps and intense concentration, her eyes nearly crossing as she looked for any pattern that didn\u2019t fit. She would have missed it if she\u2019d so much as blinked, but there it was. A shoelace. Just the end between two leaves.</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho you shooting now?\u201d Cole asked in amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou. Just found you.\u201d</p><p>Dolphin\u2019s laughter broke in.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Cole said in a terse voice.</p><p>But there was a pause, and then the shoelace disappeared, and the foliage surrounding it shifted slightly as if blown by a breeze.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNice move, but I\u2019d have already nailed you. You gotta watch those huge feet of yours, Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Cole muttered.</p><p>\u201cIs it true what they say about men with big feet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome down here and I\u2019ll let you find out.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou dream big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs amusing as I find you two, I want radio silence and I want it now,\u201d Steele ordered.</p><p>P.J. complied with the order and went silent. But she was still smiling as she went about her surveillance.</p><p>THE safe house was a large cabin ensconced in a wall of trees and buried in the foothills of the Appalachians. The area surrounding it was wide open and gently sloping. She could see its appeal from a protection standpoint. No way anyone could sneak up on you here.</p><p>Still, Sophie nervously surveyed the terrain and wondered if it would be safe. If her uncle would find her here, and if he did, would Sam and his team be enough to protect her?</p><p>Sam touched her hand, and she turned to look at him. His fingers curled around hers and he squeezed reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine here, Soph.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and hoped it looked genuine. \u201cHow long do we have to stay here? Will you be going with the others when they go after my unc . . . my father?\u201d</p><p>He looked startled by her question. \u201cYou\u2019re so sure that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s what I would do. He\u2019s a threat to your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a threat to you and our child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to let him remain a threat.\u201d</p><p>She raised a trembling hand to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Is your head hurting? What about your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He frowned but didn\u2019t press. The SUV rolled to a stop, and Sam cut the engine before looking up to where Steele strode across the yard to meet them.</p><p>\u201cStay put until I come around for you,\u201d Sam said as he opened the door and stuck a leg out.</p><p>She nodded, and he stepped out of the truck and shut the door, leaving her in silence.</p><p>He and Steele conversed, and Steele made several gestures at the surrounding area. Fear knotted her belly. Not fear for her safety. She felt at ease for the first time since she\u2019d fled her father\u2019s estate. This was a different fear.</p><p>She had to tell Sam everything. Soon.</p><p>Sam walked around the front of the truck and opened her door. He reached in to help her down and then hurried her toward the cabin.</p><p>She shivered as the cool, damp air brushed over her skin. The sun still hadn\u2019t burned off the fog, and the ground was shrouded in light mist. She inhaled deep and pulled the moisture into her dry throat.</p><p>The wooden steps creaked under their feet as they climbed up to the porch. Sam opened the door and a rush of warmer air hit her in the face.</p><p>The inside was sparsely decorated, with only a couch and one well-worn armchair in the living room. A large stone fireplace dominated the back wall, but the hearth was empty and no fire blazed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t fancy, nor was it furnished beyond the bare necessities, but it felt safe. She had no idea if that was any real intuition or just a product of her wishful thinking. But for once it was nice to depend on someone other than herself for her well-being. She was tired\u2014beyond tired\u2014of running, of always fearing the current day would be her last.</p><p>Sam ran his hand up her back and over her shoulder before giving her a light squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She turned and smiled at him and marveled at how nice it felt to really smile. To feel like smiling even amid such adversity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Better than okay. I was just thinking how nice it was to feel safe and to feel like I could depend on someone other than myself.\u201d</p><p>Puzzled by the sudden discomfort that crossed Sam\u2019s face, she cocked her head to the side.</p><p>\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He recovered quickly and shook his head. \u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019m glad you feel safe. I want you to feel safe.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around at the empty cabin and lifted her hands. \u201cSo what do we do? Play cards? Monopoly?\u201d</p><p>Though it was a joke, a tingle of excitement jolted through her at the idea of doing something so simple as play childhood games, games that Sam had probably played a million times growing up. She\u2019d never done such mundane things. Never had those moments of playful, mindless fun.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI need to get back with Steele and make sure the perimeter is secure, see what if any concerns he has. I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t pack cards or Monopoly, but we can always play truth or dare.\u201d</p><p>He waggled his eyebrows suggestively and grinned. It transformed his face from serious hard-ass to light and playful. Her heart fluttered. He really was extraordinarily good-looking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never played truth or dare, but it sounds interesting.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in mock horror. \u201cNever? Your education has been sorely neglected. What about spin the bottle?\u201d</p><p>She solemnly shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI can give you the abbreviated version of both games. You end up in a closet kissing me with my hand up your shirt.\u201d</p><p>She held a hand over her mouth to stifle the giggle. \u201cIf that\u2019s supposed to warn me off, I\u2019m afraid it didn\u2019t do the job.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes went molten, and he swaggered closer to her. He chucked her chin upward with his knuckle and then fused his lips to hers in a long, hot kiss.</p><p>She leaned in closer, her knees going weak. She loved his taste. Loved the slight bristle of beard stubble over her chin. She loved how he smelled\u2014couldn\u2019t put a name on it\u2014but it was a heady mixture of blatant masculinity and comfort. If she could bottle it, she\u2019d make a fortune.</p><p>He drew away long enough to touch her swollen lips with the tip of his finger.</p><p>\u201cHold that thought,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll be back and we can take up where we left off. I\u2019ll even trade the closet for the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>She parted her lips and nibbled at his finger, then sucked it inward. He stiffened and his pupils dilated. Let him imagine her mouth around his cock. It would give him something to think about.</p><p>With a saucy grin, she let his finger fall away, and she started in the direction of the bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d she called back. \u201cIn the closet.\u201d</p><p>His bark of laughter followed her as she stepped into the small bedroom.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen anyone when they\u2019d driven up, but there had been another vehicle parked on the side of the cabin. She knew they were here\u2014somewhere\u2014but she was happy to hold on to the illusion of privacy for her and Sam.</p><p>Sam could do his thing, check in with his team. She knew he\u2019d see to their safety. She trusted him, which was an odd\u2014and new\u2014sensation for her. Trust wasn\u2019t a word she\u2019d even contemplated before. But she decided she liked it. She liked it very much.</p><p>SAM entered the bedroom to find it empty. The sound of running water reached his ears, and he followed the trail of clothing on the floor from the bed to the bathroom. He smiled when he stepped into the bathroom and saw Sophie\u2019s silhouette behind the glass door of the shower.</p><p>He ducked back out and positioned his radio and the sat phone on the small dresser for easy access, and then he went back into the bathroom. When he heard the water turn off, he swiped a towel from the rack and waited for Sophie to open the shower door.</p><p>A fist slammed into his gut when the door swung open and he saw her standing there, her water-slicked body glowing in the light. She looked up and her wide, startled eyes met his gaze.</p><p>God but she was beautiful. Droplets slid down her neck, over the swell of her breasts and then to the swollen mound of her belly. He couldn\u2019t get enough of simply watching her.</p><p>Mechanically he moved forward and held the towel open for her to step into. Shivering, she melted into his arms, and he wrapped the towel around her and then rubbed briskly to dry her.</p><p>The towel fell to the floor, and his hands glided over her warm, soft skin.</p><p>\u201cI just want to touch you,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t get enough of how you feel.\u201d</p><p>She moaned and arched into his hands like a cat wanting to be rubbed. The tips of her breasts brushed over his shirt, and he suddenly wanted to be as naked as she was.</p><p>He positioned his hands underneath her breasts and then turned his palms up to cup the swells. The motion plumped them up and her nipples puckered and grew hard. He had to taste them, wanted them in his mouth. He wanted to suck them and let her sweet taste explode on his tongue.</p><p>Impatiently he hoisted her into his arms, swiveled around and started to set her down on the counter next to the sink.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He put her down, grabbed the towel and quickly spread it over the cool tile. Then he lifted her again and eased her down on the towel.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head to one pink-tipped breast. He blew over it gently, watching it in fascination as it puckered again. She shivered in reaction and leaned back to give him better access.</p><p>He swiped his tongue over the crest. Velvety. He loved the way it felt in his mouth, loved the way she tensed and danced under his touch. She was so honest in her response and didn\u2019t shy away. She gave everything to him.</p><p>He leaned farther in to suck the tempting little bud into his mouth and winced when his groin pressed into the edge of the counter. Jesus, but he was hard, and he was dying to get inside her.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLet me see you.\u201d</p><p>Tentatively she pulled her knees up and then parted her thighs. Blond curls guarded soft, pink flesh. He ran his thumb down the seam and then pressed inward, finding her damp center.</p><p>\u201cI have to taste you.\u201d</p><p>He heard her quick intake of breath even as he lowered himself to his knees in front of her.</p><p>\u201cPut your feet on my shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd relax.\u201d</p><p>The balls of her feet dug into his shoulders. Using two fingers, he parted the delicate folds of her pussy. His mouth hovered precariously close, and he inhaled her scent just as he kissed the opening. Keeping his mouth pressed tight to her, he pushed his tongue inward, savoring the hot, silky essence.</p><p>She moaned and shuddered, and for a moment her feet left his shoulders. Her fingers shoved forcefully over his scalp and then she guided him back when he drew away.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Oh Sam, touch me.\u201d</p><p>He licked gently, wanting to bring her as much pleasure as he was taking. He kissed his way up to her clit and then tongued it before sucking carefully to bring it farther into his mouth.</p><p>She began to shake. Her excitement spurred his. His cock swelled and strained against his jeans, and he knew if he didn\u2019t get inside her soon, he was going to come regardless.</p><p>He stood abruptly and fumbled with his zipper. He was as clumsy and unpolished as a teenager with his first girl, but nothing mattered except finding her sweet heat.</p><p>He moaned his relief when his cock came free and jutted forward. His hand closed around it while the other shoved his jeans down over his hips.</p><p>He fitted himself to her opening, then rubbed the tip of his cock up and down and finally inside. The opening flared around the head, and he closed his eyes, gritted his teeth and hoped to hell he could maintain a tight leash on his control.</p><p>He pumped his hips forward and thrust to the hilt in one hard push. She gasped. He gasped. He locked his jaw and stood still, absorbing the sensation of so much tight, wet flesh surrounding his dick.</p><p>Her hands curled around his shoulders and her fingers dug deep. He opened his eyes and searched her gaze for any sign that he\u2019d hurt her, that he\u2019d gone too fast.</p><p>He felt callous. A first-rate ass. But he was lost in the feel of her and helpless to do anything but drive. He withdrew and thrust. He strained up on the balls of his feet in an effort to get deeper.</p><p>\u201cTell me if I hurt you,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>Even as he said it, he hoped to hell he wasn\u2019t, because he wasn\u2019t sure he had the strength to stop.</p><p>Her fingers cut into his skin and her breaths left her lips in soft little bursts.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Her breasts shook with each thrust, and his hands left the edge of the counter to cup the supple mounds. His thumbs brushed the tips in rapid strokes to mimic the motion of his hips.</p><p>Fire centered in his groin, balled in a painful knot and then exploded outward into his gut and to his balls. His release lurked, menacing in its power, and he stopped, wanting to prolong the moment.</p><p>He rested against her, his sac pressed against her ass, his dick completely encased in her heat. She twitched and pulsed around him and she twisted restlessly, telling him without words that she needed more.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me, baby. I can\u2019t wait any longer. You feel so good.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew, and the ache intensified as she rippled across his length. He pushed forward again, taking care even as his mind screamed at him to take her as hard and as rough as he could.</p><p>He reined in that urge and sank deep, then stood motionless before repeating the act all over again. His release drew his balls up, so tight it hurt, and when he plunged deep again, it shot up his cock. He spilled hot and liquid even as his hips jerked spasmodically against her.</p><p>He dropped his hand down her body, let it slide over the tight ball of her stomach and then dipped between them through the soft curls until he found the tiny nub of flesh between her folds.</p><p>She gasped, arched up, and he pressed in, rotating in a tight circle until he felt her flutter around his cock. He thrust one last time and she cried out. Her hands fell from his shoulders and she gripped the edge of the counter, her knuckles going white.</p><p>He rolled his thumb over her clit and she went liquid around him. He continued to slide back and forth, until finally he slipped from the welcoming grasp of her body. He stood, trying to squeeze air into his tortured lungs. His knees shook and he\u2019d never felt so limber, so completely satisfied, in his life.</p><p>He leaned forward, gathered her in his arms and rested his forehead against hers as they both struggled for breath.</p><p>Her soft blue gaze found his, and she smiled, a gesture he felt to his toes.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was almost a closet.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed her and wondered not for the first time how he could ever stand to let her go.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>\u201cTHIS blows,\u201d Rusty complained as she stared at the television set in boredom.</p><p>Marlene Kelly gave her one of those enduring motherly looks that suggested she didn\u2019t appreciate Rusty\u2019s assessment.</p><p>Frank made a grunt from his seat in the recliner and rubbed a hand over his chest. \u201cYou\u2019ll make this a lot easier if you keep a decent attitude, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Rusty nearly groaned. She hated the young lady bit. Frank pulled it out only when he was calling her down about something, and it made her feel about two inches tall. Amazing how he could do that without ever raising his voice.</p><p>She and the \u201cparents\u201d had been herded into some podunk little house several miles away from Dover, all in the name of safety, and here they sat twiddling their thumbs like morons while Sam and company were off saving the world, or at least the chick Sam had been dumb enough to knock up.</p><p>Donovan was out playing superhero with Rio and company. Maybe they\u2019d do something cool like plant explosives to keep the bad dudes away.</p><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for missing school, this would double blow,\u201d she muttered. \u201cAt least the eye candy isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>Frank rolled his eyes and looked over at Marlene. \u201cYou see, this is why we didn\u2019t have girls. They\u2019re all hormonally deranged.\u201d</p><p>Rusty grinned. \u201cI just call it like I see it.\u201d</p><p>Frank rubbed absently at his chest and grimaced. He shifted in his seat but never moved his palm.</p><p>\u201cFrank, is something wrong?\u201d Marlene asked in a worried tone.</p><p>\u201cNah, just a case of indigestion. I wonder if they have any antacids around here. Place seems stocked well enough.\u201d</p><p>Rusty snorted, but she got up from the couch and headed toward the kitchen. Well stocked? Well stocked would be having something to do in this godforsaken place. They didn\u2019t even have cable TV, so they were stuck watching two of the major networks, and she hated sitcoms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rummaged around in the cabinets but didn\u2019t find anything that resembled antacid. She did find some ibuprofen, so she shook out a few of the pills and poured a glass of milk from the fridge.</p><p>She returned to the living room and handed Frank the glass of milk.</p><p>\u201cNo antacid, but isn\u2019t milk supposed to help? I got you some pain stuff. Maybe that\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>Frank smiled and took the medicine from her outstretched palm. \u201cThank you, Rusty. I\u2019m sure this will do the trick.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged and headed back to the couch to sit next to Marlene.</p><p>Family sitcoms were the worst. Watching dysfunctional people trying to be funny while appearing all happy happy was worse than watching paint dry. She knew all about dysfunction, and it didn\u2019t go hand in hand with happy or funny.</p><p>She sighed and tuned out the laughs of the studio audience and wondered how long it took to save the world. A few days? Weeks? She\u2019d ask Marlene how long, but it would only earn her another one of those motherly looks that made her cringe.</p><p>She turned when she heard Frank move. He sat forward in his chair, holding his arm. He looked pale and strained and he huffed for breath.</p><p>Alarmed, she glanced at Marlene, to see her staring at Frank as well.</p> <p>\u201cFrank,\u201d Marlene said sharply. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Marlene. I just need to get up and move around. Feels like a damn elephant is sitting on my chest.\u201d</p><p>He struggled to his feet and for a moment stood stock-still before he swayed. With a groan, he pitched forward and hit the floor with a thud.</p><p>Panic hit Rusty like a ton of bricks. She surged to her feet and screamed for Rio and Donovan at the top of her lungs.</p><p>Marlene threw herself onto the floor beside Frank at the same time Rusty scrambled over the coffee table to kneel beside him.</p><p>\u201cIs he breathing?\u201d Rusty asked fearfully. \u201cOh my God, is he dead?\u201d</p> <p>Before Marlene could respond, Rusty leaned her ear down to his chest, feeling for any movement. She reached a hand up to his neck. You were supposed to feel for a pulse, right?</p><p>He wasn\u2019t moving. God, he wasn\u2019t breathing. She didn\u2019t think his chest was moving at all. She couldn\u2019t feel a pulse, but her hands were shaking so bad that she doubted she could have felt one anyway.</p><p>Rio and Donovan burst into the room, one of the other men tailing them. They all had their guns up, but when they saw Frank on the floor and the two women surrounding him, they tossed the guns aside and rushed over.</p><p>Donovan shoved Rusty out of the way and immediately checked for breathing and a pulse. Rio bent next to him and tore open Frank\u2019s shirt at the chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s n-not breathing,\u201d Rusty said.</p><p>Rio\u2019s gaze found hers for just a moment, and she saw steady reassurance there. Then he doubled his hands and positioned them over Frank\u2019s heart. Face drawn and pale, Donovan tilted Frank\u2019s neck back, then leaned down and began mouth-to-mouth.</p><p>Marlene was on her knees, her face so white that it scared Rusty. She looked like she was in shock, and worse, there was such fear in her eyes that it hit Rusty in the gut like a punch.</p><p>\u201cMarlene. Marlene!\u201d Rio added the last more forcefully.</p> <p>Marlene snapped to awareness and looked at Rio.</p><p>\u201cCall 911. We have to get him to a hospital.\u201d</p><p>Rusty started to shake. There wasn\u2019t a part of her body that wasn\u2019t trembling violently. Oh God, not Frank. No, no, no. Tears welled in her eyes and she wrapped both arms around herself in an effort to gain control.</p><p>Rio\u2019s expression was grim as he and Donovan continued CPR. Donovan wouldn\u2019t look in her or Marlene\u2019s direction. His steadfast focus was on forcing air in and out of his father\u2019s lungs. Marlene raced to the phone, and Rusty could dimly hear her relaying the situation to the dispatcher.</p><p>Only seconds later, Marlene returned and stood anxiously over the men. \u201cThey said an ambulance would be here in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Donovan didn\u2019t acknowledge her. He kept on with the breaths.</p><p>The wait was the worst Rusty had ever endured in her life. It was like a bad video that was stuck in a replay loop. It didn\u2019t seem real. It couldn\u2019t be real. This wasn\u2019t happening. She couldn\u2019t lose Frank. He believed in her. No one else believed in her.</p><p>When the paramedics finally arrived, they had to force Donovan away. It was a blur. There was a tube and needles. Lines and a machine. When they paused in CPR to check for a rhythm and the thin, red, flat line streamed across the monitor, Rusty lost it.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>She threw herself forward and shoved the paramedic out of the way. She hugged Frank to her, sobbing, her heart breaking.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried hysterically. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me. Please don\u2019t leave me. You can\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>Rio plucked her off, and she kicked and fought him until he wrapped both arms around her and held her immobile. The medics quickly wheeled Frank out of the room to the waiting ambulance, and when Marlene would have followed Donovan, Rio\u2019s man gently reined her in.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Rusty,\u201d Rio said in a low voice next to her ear. \u201cHe\u2019s not gone. Not yet. They can save him. You have to believe that. You can\u2019t give up on him. He\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>Tears ran down her cheeks. She\u2019d never felt so lost in her life. Not when her stupid mother ran out on her. Not when her asshole stepfather made her life miserable. Not when she\u2019d tried to turn tricks just to find a way out of her life.</p><p>\u201cRio, why can\u2019t I go with him?\u201d Marlene asked in a stricken voice. \u201cWhere are they taking him? I need to be with him. I need to be with Donovan.\u201d</p><p>Rio gently set Rusty down on the couch and took the seat beside her. He cupped her cheek even as tears splashed over the back of his hand. He glanced over at Marlene.</p><p>\u201cMy job is to keep you safe. All of you. I\u2019ll take you to the hospital. But we\u2019ll do this right. You go with me. You don\u2019t go anywhere without me. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Marlene nodded numbly, her eyes glazed with fear and grief. Then she crossed the room and sat down next to Rusty, pulling her into her arms.</p><p>Rusty hugged her fiercely and buried her face against her breast. All moms needed to smell like Marlene. Warm and comforting. Rusty\u2019s only experience with mothers\u2019 smells was one of alcohol and stale cigarette smoke.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Marlene said as she rocked Rusty back and forth. \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter, Rusty. All the Kellys are. It\u2019ll take more than a heart attack to put Frank down. He\u2019s survived worse.\u201d</p><p>Rusty choked back another sob and clung desperately to those words. She knew Marlene was putting up a brave front for her, and she appreciated it\u2014loved Marlene for doing it\u2014but she felt Marlene\u2019s betraying tremble and the fear that was laced into those words of comfort.</p><p>Rio put a hand on Rusty\u2019s back and then slid it up to squeeze her shoulder. \u201cIf you two will come with me, we\u2019ll get you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>SOPHIE woke to an empty bed and the sun streaming through a crack in the blinds. She turned from the glare, reached for Sam\u2019s pillow and hugged it to her, inhaling his scent.</p><p>She was deliciously tired and sore from their love-making, and for the first time she didn\u2019t dread telling Sam everything. She\u2019d confide in him about the key and trust him to do the right thing with the information. He was a good man, and she didn\u2019t think for a minute he\u2019d betray her trust.</p><p>Smiling, she got out of bed and pulled on one of the pairs of elastic-waisted jeans she\u2019d found waiting for her. She\u2019d been ridiculously touched that there had been actual maternity clothes in her size along with all the accoutrements, including a bra that fit and underwear.</p><p>With a satisfied sigh, she went in search of Sam. She didn\u2019t want to put off the inevitable any longer. She\u2019d tell him, get it over with, and then hopefully she could put the past behind her.</p><p>The murmur of voices from the living room grew louder as she ventured down the hall. When she rounded the corner, she was surprised to see someone standing with Sam and Garrett. She knew Garrett was supposed to arrive today, but Sam hadn\u2019t said what he\u2019d been doing.</p><p>All three men turned when they heard her, and now, subject to their scrutiny, she wished she\u2019d just stayed in bed.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m interrupting, I can just go back ...\u201d</p><p>She started to turn, but Sam strode over, his expression indecipherable. He took her hand, but tension radiated from him, and she glanced nervously over at the new guy again.</p><p>\u201cSophie, I want you to meet Adam Resnick. He\u2019s here to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise, and her gaze rapidly went from man to man. Garrett as usual stood there looking like you could break a rock on his face. The Resnick guy looked . . . eager, for lack of a better word. Sam looked . . . worried.</p><p>\u201cTo me?\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounded harder. She broke out in a sweat, and she swallowed in vain at the knot in her throat. How would this man\u2014whoever he was\u2014know anything about her? Why would he want to talk to her?</p><p>Resnick stepped forward. \u201cSophie. Can I call you Sophie?\u201d</p><p>She nodded stiffly and waited, her dread increasing with each second.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with . . . Well let\u2019s just say I represent the interests of the United States government, and I\u2019d like to talk to you about your father.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath, and her shocked gaze went to Sam. He\u2019d sold her out. He\u2019d actually sold her out! Sam frowned and reached out for her, but she flinched away, putting half the room between them.</p><p>For a long moment she stood, fists clenched, facing away from the occupants of the room. When she turned, she refused to look at Sam. She directed her gaze at Resnick and asked in a cold voice, \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Resnick moved toward her, and she took a quick step back. Her chin went up, and she forced calm she didn\u2019t feel.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said truthfully.</p><p>\u201cOkay, where is he likely to be? If you\u2019d give us information on his holdings we can match it to what we know of him. Maybe we\u2019re missing something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Resnick made a sound of frustration. \u201cWhat can you tell us, Sophie? If you cooperate fully, we\u2019ll make allowances for you.\u201d</p><p>A chill went down her spine.</p><p>\u201cResnick,\u201d Sam growled.</p><p>Sophie ignored Sam and stared straight at Resnick. \u201cAllowances? What sort of allowances should I expect? What is it you\u2019re threatening me with?\u201d</p><p>Resnick held up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not threatening you. I\u2019m merely pointing out that we can do more to help you if you cooperate with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh nice,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is I\u2019m on my own unless I play nice with the FBI or CIA or whoever the hell you are. You know what? I\u2019m fine with that. I never should have relied on anyone but myself anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d Sam cut in, his voice hard enough to direct her gaze toward him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Sam.\u201d She pressed her hands to the sides of her legs to keep them from shaking. She stared at him unflinchingly as she delivered her judgment. \u201cThe moment you brought him here, he spoke for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, damn it.\u201d</p><p>She looked away again, anger vibrating in her throat. She wasn\u2019t getting into this with him in front of others\u2014or anytime.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to help me,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cHe\u2019s hurt a lot of people. As his daughter you know this. We think he\u2019s trying to put together technology to build a nuclear weapon and auctioning it to the highest bidder. He has to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never\u2014that is he doesn\u2019t\u2014confide in me. I\u2019m not privy to the details of his business dealings,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, yes, I understand that,\u201d he said in a placating tone. \u201cBut there are things you can tell us about him, small details that you might not think will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomas is who you should be looking for.\u201d</p><p>Resnick blinked in surprise and then looked at the others, as if gauging their reaction to her statement.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that? We were led to believe that Tomas had no power whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>She stared coolly at him, her hands still tight against her sides. \u201cYou asked, I told you. He wants me dead, but maybe you don\u2019t care about that.\u201d</p><p>Resnick stared intently at her. \u201cIs he dead, Sophie? Did Tomas kill Alex in an attempt to seize power? Is that why he\u2019s after you now, because you\u2019re Alex\u2019s heir? Or do you have something he wants?\u201d</p><p>The blood left Sophie\u2019s face. She willed herself to keep it together. Her stomach revolted, and now her skin felt hot and clammy.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>She bolted, ignoring Sam\u2019s worried question as to whether she was okay. Okay? How could she be okay when she\u2019d been played for the biggest fool ever?</p><p>God, when was she going to stop being so damn trusting? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hearing footsteps behind her, she slammed the bathroom door behind her and locked it. Last thing she needed was Sam hovering over her.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he called through the door. \u201cDamn it, Sophie, open the door so I can see if you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over the sink and breathed deeply, sucking air through her nostrils as she fought the urge to puke. She sensed Sam\u2019s presence for several more seconds before she finally heard him retreat and walk back down the hall.</p><p>She splashed water on her face and stared at her reflection in the mirror until she was sure she didn\u2019t look like she was about to fall apart. She looked down at her hands and raised them in front of her and waited for the shaking to stop. When she was satisfied she could hold it together for however long this \u201cquestioning\u201d lasted, she opened the door and quietly walked back into the hall.</p> <p>When she reached the end, Resnick\u2019s words stopped her cold in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cI have to take her in. You know that, Sam. She\u2019s too valuable to let go. She knows something. Even you can see that.\u201d</p><p>Fear nearly knocked her to her knees. A dull roar started in her ears as her blood pounded furiously. Hell if she\u2019d escape her uncle only to fall prey to some government lackey who was eager to put a notch in his belt by taking down the Mouton family.</p><p>She didn\u2019t escape one prison only to enter another. Her child would have a better life than she had, and she\u2019d do anything to ensure that. She already had.</p><p>She turned, her mind working frantically for an escape route. There were windows in the bedrooms, but she certainly hadn\u2019t inspected them to see if they opened. Now seemed a good enough time.</p> <p>\u201cYOU are out of your goddamn mind,\u201d Sam snarled. \u201cSophie stays with me and that\u2019s nonnegotiable.\u201d</p><p>Resnick blew out his breath and dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cLook, Sam, I don\u2019t have a choice in this. This is a matter of national security. Surely you can see that. I have to do whatever it takes to stop Mouton, even if that means taking his daughter into custody. Hell, I\u2019m not going to hurt her. I\u2019d make sure she was taken care of. She\u2019d have the best medical care for her and the baby.\u201d</p><p>Sam grabbed Resnick by the collar and slammed him against the wall. \u201cMy child. Mine. That\u2019s my baby and Sophie\u2019s my woman. I don\u2019t give a fuck about what your superiors are saying. She stays under my protection.\u201d</p><p>Garrett stuck an arm between Sam and Resnick and pried Sam away. \u201cCool it, Sam. You two need to chill the fuck out. This isn\u2019t helping.\u201d</p><p>Sam jerked away and cupped a hand over the back of his neck as he paced across the room.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Sam, you have to know my hands are tied here,\u201d Resnick said.</p> <p>Garrett held his hands up. \u201cI think Mouton is dead, and I think Sophie knows it.\u201d</p><p>Sam and Resnick both glanced sharply at Garrett.</p><p>\u201cWe have that as one of the possible scenarios,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cBut what makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s been holding back from the start. She\u2019s been as jumpy as a cricket, but she\u2019s slipped up a few times and referred to her father in the past tense. She\u2019s said nothing of him being after her, but she\u2019s mentioned the uncle. What if you\u2019re right about Tomas making a power play? He kills Alex, maybe even tries to kill Sophie in the takeover. She escapes, Tomas catches up to her, puts a bullet hole in her, and she comes to Sam for help and protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plausible,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve considered, but the only thing that makes no sense to me is why there is such an emphasis on Sophie. Women have never meant anything in Alex\u2019s empire. They\u2019re used and discarded or kept under tight wraps, as I suspect Sophie has been. If she escaped, while Tomas might be annoyed, I can\u2019t imagine him risking so much to pursue her on U.S. soil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless she has something he wants,\u201d Sam said grimly.</p><p>Garrett nodded. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Sam started to head toward the bathroom, but he stopped. Impatience simmered in his veins, but he had to handle this just right. He\u2019d hurt Sophie by keeping this from her. She wasn\u2019t going to be very cooperative now because he\u2019d lost her trust.</p> <p>For the hundredth time he questioned his decision to allow Resnick to meet with Sophie. He hadn\u2019t wanted to anger a man who handed them so many of their missions, but in agreeing, he\u2019d placed business ahead of his child, and that made him a huge dumbass.</p><p>He\u2019d hoped that Sophie wouldn\u2019t know anything, Resnick would be satisfied, and then he\u2019d leave and Sophie would be free of any \u201cinterest to national security.\u201d That wasn\u2019t going to happen now, and he was going to have to contend with a woman who felt betrayed.</p><p>P.J. scanned the area in two-minute intervals, her eyes peeled for anything that wasn\u2019t supposed to be. It was a damn boring job, but she never allowed boredom to interfere. A single lapse could cost lives, and she\u2019d had to learn patience the hard way when she\u2019d worked in SWAT.</p><p>Some lessons you learned by the book. Others you learned from cold hard experience. The latter may not be the best way to learn, but it damn well stuck.</p><p>She swept the perimeter again, and when she got to the house, she stopped, not believing what she was seeing.</p><p>\u201cWell hello,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Sophie was climbing out the window. Impressive for a pregnant lady. P.J. had always imagined pregnancy making a woman awkward as hell and about as graceful as a moose, but Sophie made quick work of the window and ran like a rabbit for the woods.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cSteele, we\u2019ve got a problem. Subject is escaping into the woods. Heading north. Fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay again?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she didn\u2019t believe it either.</p><p>She repeated the information and heard Steele\u2019s soft curse.</p><p>\u201cDolphin, you\u2019re with me. Cole, you and P.J. stay on lookout, and P.J., relay that to Sam. Tell him Dolphin and I are on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two always have all the fun while I get stuck in the trees,\u201d she complained. Not that she really wanted to mess with a pregnant woman. There was too much similarity between them and pit bulls for her liking.</p><p>She\u2019d take on a man anytime, thank you very much.</p><p>She tapped the button to switch from the privacy of her communication with her team and then fired a message Sam\u2019s way.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>\u201cSHE what?\u201d Sam demanded.</p><p>He yanked the receiver from his ear and stalked down the hallway to the bathroom. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! The bathroom was empty. So was the bedroom. Only the cracked window told him the story as P.J. relayed it.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Garrett demanded from the doorway.</p><p>Resnick stood to the side of Garrett, his brow drawn in concern.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone. She went out the window. P.J. saw her running into the woods. Steele and Dolphin are in pursuit.\u201d</p><p>Resnick swore, and it set Sam off. He closed the distance between them and slammed Resnick against the wall in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cYou stay away from her. You leave here and you forget you ever knew she existed, you got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that, Sam. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it for me.\u201d</p><p>Resnick blew out his breath and sagged. \u201cGoddamn it, Sam. What a time to call in a favor.\u201d</p><p>Sam let go of his shirt. \u201cWe have to get moving. Sophie is out there. She probably thinks I\u2019m set to turn her in.\u201d</p><p>The peal of Sam\u2019s cell phone stopped him as he strode down the hall. Seeing Rio\u2019s number on the LCD, he jerked it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cSam here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, we need to talk. I have a situation.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Fear slithered down his spine and his grip tightened on the phone.</p><p>\u201cCan it wait? Sophie took off. Dolphin and Steele have gone after her. Garrett and I need to go as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Sam glanced up at Garrett.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go after her,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d Resnick offered.</p><p>Garrett shook his head. \u201cYou show your face, she\u2019ll run hard in the other direction. You stay here with Sam until we can get you the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel so valued,\u201d Resnick said dryly.</p><p>Garrett ignored him and hurried out the door.</p><p>Sam turned away and put the phone back to his ear. \u201cTalk to me, Rio. Make it fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad, Sam. Your father had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Sam stumbled and had to catch himself on the kitchen cabinets. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in ICU. They\u2019re monitoring him closely.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>\u201cWhat else? Just say it,\u201d Sam demanded.</p><p>God, don\u2019t let him die. Don\u2019t let his dad die.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s gone missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell? What do you mean she\u2019s gone missing? She\u2019d never be anywhere but at Dad\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Goddamn it I know, Sam. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve let you down. I still don\u2019t know how the hell it happened. I wouldn\u2019t even let her ride in the ambulance with him to the hospital. I told her that she and Rusty weren\u2019t to go anywhere without me. Period. I took them myself. My men are here in the family room. I requested something private. We have tight security around the intensive care unit. I have someone at all possible entries. Your mom was allowed in to see him a couple of hours ago. She came out and Donovan went in. She seemed to be okay. She spoke to Rusty for a few minutes and then excused herself to go to the restroom. I sent a man with her. He stood outside the door. When they didn\u2019t return, I found him dead inside one of the stalls and your mom was nowhere to be found. I\u2019m going over hospital surveillance now, and I have the rest of my team turning the hospital inside out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Son of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never felt more out of control in his life. Everything was crumbling around him and he felt helpless to stop it.</p><p>\u201cI want this son of a bitch,\u201d Rio seethed. \u201cThe bastard preys on helpless women. First Sophie and now Marlene. He killed one of my men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what he wants, but I expect we\u2019ll find out shortly,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI just hope to hell he\u2019ll want to negotiate.\u201d</p><p>His gut knotted and he wanted to puke. His hand shook around the phone, and he mashed it against his ear to keep from dropping it.</p><p>\u201cMake sure Rusty and my father are safe. Do whatever you have to do. I want you to keep me posted on his condition. And for God\u2019s sake sit on Donovan and make sure he doesn\u2019t do anything stupid. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll guard them with my life,\u201d Rio said softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I let you down, Sam.\u201d</p><p>Sam closed his eyes and slowly pulled the phone away from his ear.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay, Sam?\u201d</p><p>He turned to see Resnick standing a few feet away, his hands shoved into his pockets.</p><p>\u201cHe has her,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cThat bastard has my mother. My father is in the hospital with a heart attack, and that son of a bitch took her when she went to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Resnick ran a hand back and forth over his head. \u201cChrist, Sam, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s fist curled into a tight fist and he rammed it into the cabinet. The wood splintered and pain shot through his hand.</p><p>\u201cI have to go find Sophie. Then I have to go to my dad. Then I\u2019m going after this son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>He stared Resnick down, letting the full force of his fury bleed into his expression.</p><p>\u201cYou stay the hell out of my way. Make damn sure no one makes a move on Mouton. Last thing I want is for you guys to finally decide to make a move and have my mother caught in the cross fire.\u201d</p><p>Resnick pulled a crumpled pack of cigarettes out of his breast pocket and hastily shoved one into his mouth. He lit it and sucked in a deep breath. Then he exhaled, blowing a steady stream of smoke from his lungs.</p><p>\u201cI can only buy you so much time, Sam. We can\u2019t allow whoever it is in charge\u2014whether it\u2019s Alex or Tomas\u2014to sell a fucking nuclear weapon to some shithole third world country with a terrorist agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring him down. Or I\u2019ll die trying.\u201d</p><p>Resnick nodded and sucked on his cigarette again. He paced around the living room in agitation, taking jerky drags and spewing the smoke in noisy exhalations.</p><p>Sam checked his sidearm, then reached for the rifle lying on the counter. He shoved his earpiece in and positioned the mic in front of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cReport in. Any sign of Sophie yet? I\u2019m coming out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegative,\u201d Steele responded. \u201cWe\u2019re looking.\u201d</p><p>Sam swore and shoved out of the door.</p><p>SOPHIE huddled between two of the three large stone outcroppings and forced herself to slow her breathing. Her pulse thudded like a hammer, until all she could hear was her heartbeat and each breath, in and out.</p><p>She\u2019d climbed over the tall stone face and slipped behind it in an effort to find a hiding place. Unless someone climbed up the same way she had, no one would find her here. She was protected on all sides and had enough room to stretch out in the craggy moss. It was damp and chilly, but she\u2019d be safe here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All she had to do was be patient. Sam would search for her. They\u2019d fan out, cover the territory surrounding the cabin, and they\u2019d gradually move outward until she was behind the search radius. If she could outlast them and they didn\u2019t find her, she could double back and escape undetected.</p><p>Her plan was brilliant, and she wasn\u2019t out running like a headless chicken, but it was only brilliant if it worked.</p><p>She stifled the hysterical laughter that threatened to bubble up. She\u2019d had plenty of experience running. Hiding like some fugitive. But she hadn\u2019t imagined having to flee the man she\u2019d trusted to protect her.</p><p>She drew her legs farther into her, molding them against her belly. She dropped her head to her knees as anger worked over her skin, hot and itchy.</p> <p>If she hadn\u2019t gone to Sam, she wouldn\u2019t have felt hope. She wouldn\u2019t have touched the sun for one brief, shining moment, only to have that warmth and joy extinguished.</p><p>She\u2019d been a fool, and now she not only had to keep ahead of her uncle, but she had to keep from being taken into custody and having God knows what done with her by whatever agency Resnick represented. If he represented one at all.</p><p>Goddamn them. Damn them all. Especially Sam.</p><p>Whoever Resnick was, the U.S. government wanted her father enough that they\u2019d do whatever it took to achieve their goal. She was expendable. Her child was expendable. They might suspect her father was dead, but they didn\u2019t know it. Not yet. And while they could do nothing with the knowledge that she\u2019d killed him, they could certainly use the information that he was dead to their advantage.</p><p>She leaned against the cool rock face and closed her eyes wearily. Just last night she\u2019d lain in Sam\u2019s arms and summoned the courage to confess that she\u2019d killed a man in cold blood. She already had so much working against her in Sam\u2019s eyes. What would he think about the mother of his child being a killer?</p> <p>Then she\u2019d woken up feeling certain that everything would be okay. Sam would understand. He wouldn\u2019t judge her. She would confess everything to him, he\u2019d take the necessary steps to take her uncle out, and then she could live in safety\u2014finally\u2014with her child. Sam\u2019s child. They could be a family.</p><p>Only Sam had never had any intention of them being anything.</p><p>For hours she sat there, until her muscles screamed in protest. Her bladder ached and she grew twitchier with each passing minute. Still, she wouldn\u2019t move. Not yet. She\u2019d wait until nightfall if it killed her.</p><p>She dozed lightly, her sleep interrupted every time she heard the slightest sound. Her neck was sore and her back was killing her. She had to shift her position.</p><p>Inch by inch, she adjusted, until she stretched her legs across the small area shielded by the rocks. A sigh of relief whispered past her lips as she curled on her side.</p><p>She looked upward to the sky, watching thin, wispy clouds roll by and the blue grow pale as the sun began to set. It wouldn\u2019t be much longer now. Her patience would be rewarded.</p> <p>She slept again, and when she woke this time, she was surprised by the darkness surrounding her. She\u2019d slept longer than she\u2019d thought she would, and now she was disoriented as to time. It was well past dusk and already stars had popped above her. Maybe Sam had given up, or broadened the search radius such that he would be miles away by now.</p><p>She rolled to her knees, braced her palms on the ground and slowly pushed herself upward. Her knees creaked, her back popped, and her wound protested the strain she was putting on it.</p><p>For several seconds she stood and stretched, working the kinks out of her stiff body. She was cold and hungry, but she shrugged off both discomforts. Neither was new to her.</p><p>As carefully as possible, she climbed over the shortest rock facing, testing her footholds to make sure she didn\u2019t fall or make unnecessary noise.</p><p>On her way over, she slipped and landed with a thump that knocked the breath from her. She wrapped her arms around her belly and lay there, mentally examining herself for any injury.</p><p>After catching her breath, she picked herself up and stared around, trying to gain her bearings. It was dark as a well bottom and there was no moonlight to guide her. Good for not being seen. Not so good for being able to see.</p><p>She crept through the trees and the underbrush a lot slower and stealthier than she\u2019d done hours before. She\u2019d had all day to come up with a plan, but the only thing that stood out was that she had to find transportation. She couldn\u2019t make it on foot if she hoped to put any distance between her and her immediate threat.</p><p>When she was but a short distance from the cabin, she paused and rubbed at the stitch in her side. She could barely make out where the trees fell away, and she inched forward, trying to make out whether the lights were on in the cabin and if the trucks were still parked out front. She didn\u2019t know how stubborn Sam would be or how long he would persist in searching for her or if he\u2019d searched at all.</p> <p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d</p><p>She whirled around and slapped a hand over her mouth to stanch the reflexive scream. The light from a flashlight blinded her, and she threw up her other arm to block it.</p><p>Poised for flight, she shot to the right, but Garrett\u2019s hand snapped around her wrist, and he hauled her up short.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she said desperately.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt yourself. Stop struggling,\u201d he said in a calm voice.</p><p>Tears knotted her throat. \u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>The light went down, and then he turned it upward so the immediate area was illuminated. She expected his face to be his usual thundercloud, but he wasn\u2019t frowning.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cYou don\u2019t even like me. You haven\u2019t liked me from the beginning. Let me go and I\u2019ll never bother you or Sam again. But at least give me a chance to protect my baby.\u201d</p><p>Something that looked like regret and unease flashed across his face. His features softened and his grip lessened on her arm. For a moment hope sparked in her chest. He was going to let her go. But when she tried to pull away, his grip tightened again.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Sophie. Sam is frantic with worry. Whatever you heard or think you heard, he isn\u2019t about to sell you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already did,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have expected anything else. He doesn\u2019t owe me anything. I was just some chick he picked up in a bar. Knocking me up wasn\u2019t part of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew Sam, you wouldn\u2019t be spouting that horse shit,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI get that you\u2019re hurt. I get that you feel betrayed. But give him a chance to explain. We will protect you, but we can\u2019t do that if you take off on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018We\u2019?\u201d she questioned. \u201cAre you including yourself in that promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she blurted. \u201cYou\u2019ve made no secret of the fact you despise me. You don\u2019t trust me. You don\u2019t want me anywhere near your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re carrying my niece or nephew. You\u2019re important to Sam.\u201d There was resignation in his voice, as if acknowledging that left a bad taste in his mouth. \u201cThat makes you important to me.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him and he met her gaze. There was no anger, none of the disapproval she\u2019d grown so used to in his eyes. She swayed in his grip, suddenly so fatigued that she would have fallen if he hadn\u2019t reached his other hand out to steady her.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you back, Sophie. You\u2019re tired, you\u2019re hurt and you have no business running like you\u2019ve been running with you carrying a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her voice turned pleading, and she stared imploringly at him, hoping she could sway him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go with that Resnick guy. Don\u2019t you understand? I\u2019m expendable to him. I\u2019m nothing in comparison to what they gain by taking down my family\u2019s network. They won\u2019t care about me or my baby. I want her to have better than I had. Please, just let me take care of my baby.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s entire face softened, but he didn\u2019t let go of her arms.</p><p>\u201cI swear to you, Sophie, Sam will never allow Resnick to take you anywhere. That was never his intention. Not only that, I won\u2019t allow it. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t really offering me a choice,\u201d she said dully.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019d like you to come back willingly, but if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be forced to bring you back by whatever means necessary.\u201d</p><p>Her chin dropped and she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she accepted quietly.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>WHEN Garrett pushed into the cabin, Sophie saw that she and Garrett were the only two occupants. He closed the door behind them and shot her a look that suggested she not think of running again.</p><p>He gestured toward the table. \u201cHave a seat. I\u2019ll get you something to eat and drink.\u201d</p><p>She sank wearily into a chair and folded her arms over the tabletop so she could rest her head. When Garrett set a glass of milk in front of her, she drank greedily and then returned her head to its perch. She closed her eyes and rested while Garrett rummaged around in the refrigerator. She was hungry, but she was too tired to eat.</p><p>A moment later, the door burst open, startling her from her lethargy. She bolted upright to see Sam stalk in, his eyes blazing. She barely had time to register her alarm before he was in front of her.</p><p>He yanked her to her feet, cupped one hand around her nape and then dragged her to him. He kissed her long and hard, his mouth molded so tight to hers that neither of them could draw a breath.</p><p>She inserted her hands between them and shoved as hard as she could. He didn\u2019t budge. Instead he deepened his kiss, as if convincing her of his ownership.</p><p>His tongue flashed over hers. Warm, wet, tasting. His fingers rubbed firmly over the column of her neck and then up into her hair, tangling with the strands.</p><p>Finally he drew away, but he kept a hold on her nape as he stared down at her through half-lidded eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever scare me like that again,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>She tried to pull away again, but he cupped his other hand to her cheek and smoothed his thumb over her swollen lips.</p><p>\u201cI know I hurt you, Sophie. I\u2019m sorry. Sorrier than I can say. I don\u2019t have time to explain everything to you now. I hope you\u2019ll understand that.\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned and strode toward Garrett. She listened in horror as he told his brother that Frank had had a heart attack and that their mother had been abducted from the hospital.</p><p>She swayed and had to brace herself against the table. She didn\u2019t chance looking at either man. She couldn\u2019t bear to see the rage in Garrett\u2019s eyes. Rage that would be directed at her.</p><p>Nausea boiled in her stomach like acid, and she gulped breaths through her mouth. Her chest heaved, and she closed her eyes before finally sinking back into the chair.</p><p>All she wanted to do was bury her face in her arms and weep.</p><p>\u201cSophie, we need to go.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head to see Sam standing by the table, his expression grim. Beyond him, Garrett was already striding from the cabin.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she croaked out.</p><p>\u201cBack home. To my father. I need to see him and then we have to find my mom.\u201d</p><p>She shakily rose, nodding her agreement. Of course they had to go. She went out ahead of Sam and nearly ran into Garrett at the bottom of the steps. He grasped her arm to steady her before Sam took over and ushered her to the truck.</p><p>The ride was silent and tense. The two men didn\u2019t speak. Garrett stared moodily out the window while Sam\u2019s gaze remained fixed on the road.</p><p>She alternated feeling guilty for bringing her uncle to their doorstep and feeling angry for feeling guilty. Her uncle going after Sam and his family was inevitable. Once Sophie had been caught, her uncle would have taken steps to eradicate the Kellys.</p><p>But now she needed to give Sam all the necessary ammunition to take the fight to her uncle and hopefully rescue his mother in the process. She prayed that Marlene would be kept alive. If her father were still in charge, Marlene would have already been killed and left for Sam and his family to find as a message. Her uncle wasn\u2019t as ruthless as her father, though. Not that he didn\u2019t try to be. He was just weaker. He wanted to be seen as someone who was strong and as capable of running a criminal empire as her father, but not many men were. Alex Mouton had had no conscience when he was living, and Sophie could only hope he was consigned to hell in death.</p><p>She pressed her lips together and inhaled deeply through her nose. Then she straightened in her seat and pushed away from the window so she could readily see both men from her position in the back.</p><p>\u201cMy father is dead.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s head came up to look at her in the rearview mirror at the same time Garrett whipped around to stare at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure of this?\u201d Sam demanded. \u201cThis is important, Sophie. We have to know for sure. We can\u2019t afford to assume anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see his body?\u201d Garrett cut in.</p><p>\u201cI saw,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m the one who killed him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam braked suddenly and pulled onto the shoulder. He shoved the truck into park but left the engine turning. Then he rotated around so he too could stare back at her.</p><p>\u201cYou want to run that by me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed him. I shot him to be exact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d Garrett muttered.</p> <p>Sam closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose in a gesture of frustration.</p><p>\u201cYou shot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, is that why your uncle is after you? Revenge?\u201d Garrett asked.</p><p>\u201cI have something he wants.\u201d</p> <p>She chased the tremble from her voice, refusing to wimp out now that she\u2019d boldly made her confession.</p><p>Sam immediately became more alert. His eyes sharpened, then narrowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey key to my father\u2019s vault.\u201d</p><p>Garrett frowned harder. \u201cAnd? That has significance why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vault houses my father\u2019s wealth. Not only his wealth, but all the details of his business transactions, his contacts, prototypes of the weapons he has developed over the years. Your Mr. Resnick was concerned about the idea of him developing nuclear technology. If he has, the details are there with everything else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he just keeps this shit locked in a vault?\u201d Garrett asked incredulously.</p><p>She almost smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not just any vault. It\u2019s an underground, state-of-the-art, completely secure, climate-controlled vault. And when I say vault, don\u2019t imagine some bank vault-type thing, something you could maybe fit a car into. This is a vast compound. It\u2019s a huge chamber with only one way in and one way out. And once you enter, you can\u2019t exit the way you came in. It\u2019s all one way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have the key to this. He just left this lying around for anyone to get,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Ignoring the sarcasm, she nodded once again. \u201cI cut it from his neck with the knife you left in the hotel room. After I shot him. It was my insurance policy. It was my way of making sure I stayed alive. I knew they\u2019d come after me for killing my father. They\u2019d hunt me down and they\u2019d dispatch me like they would any other enemy. But I wouldn\u2019t die quickly. Because I\u2019m blood and I betrayed my blood, they\u2019d make my death long and painful. Because I turned on my father, I\u2019d be made to suffer until I begged for death. That key prevents them from killing me. If they find me, they have to take me alive or risk never retrieving the only way into Alex\u2019s vast underground network of wealth and business. Tomas can only temporarily take over as leader of the Mouton family \u2018business.\u2019 Soon he\u2019ll run out of resources, money and support. Without a way into my father\u2019s vault, Tomas will be nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Sam swore. \u201cHe keeps that shit in a vault? It\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cHow so? He deals in gold. Gems. Untraceable wealth. He doesn\u2019t trust banks. He never leaves records of his transactions. Everyone else? He keeps meticulous accounts of everyone he\u2019s ever had dealings with. In his books he has the names of countless world leaders, many from the West who would die were their crimes to come to light. Many would kill for this key. I never plan to give it up.\u201d</p><p>Garrett blew out his breath and looked over at Sam. \u201cHoo boy, this just got a hell of a lot more complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you drive for a while, Garrett? We can\u2019t afford to get held up. We\u2019ve got to get to Dad.\u201d</p> <p>In response Garrett got out and walked around to the driver\u2019s door. He waited for Sam to slide out before he settled into the driver\u2019s seat. Instead of going around to where Garrett had been sitting as Sophie had expected, Sam opened the door next to her and slid in beside her.</p><p>Garrett pulled back onto the road, and Sophie sat staring at Sam, dreading his scrutiny. Dreading the inevitable questions. And the change in the way he\u2019d look at her from now on.</p><p>She slowly bowed her head and stared down at her fingers curled so tightly together in her lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>Her head came up in surprise. That wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected him to say or ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you shoot him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he needed killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you killed him,\u201d Sam said softly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe for a moment that you killed him to rid humanity of a first-rate bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t know me very well,\u201d she taunted. \u201cI killed him for just that reason. He\u2019s a bastard. He\u2019s a cold, calculating sociopath. Life means nothing to him. Everyone\u2019s but his. I took from him the one thing he valued. His own life. It was the only thing he was passionate about.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized that Sam\u2019s hand had slid up her arm until he rested his palm against the curve of her neck, waiting until she hushed her tirade. Suddenly he was caressing her skin, soothing some of the horrible tension emanating from her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I took the key because it meant no one could take over his legacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a pretty damn stupid . . . brave . . . thing to do,\u201d Garrett said grudgingly. \u201cMore stupid, mind you, but still amazingly brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the key now?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>He kept his voice as even as the light caresses he feathered over her skin. But she didn\u2019t want to talk about the key. She wanted to know why he\u2019d set her up with Resnick. If his father hadn\u2019t had a heart attack and his mother hadn\u2019t been abducted, would Sophie even now be on her way to some dark hole the U.S. government would put her in, where she\u2019d never be seen or heard from again?</p><p>It was obvious Sam was going to need her now. Now that circumstances had changed so drastically and it was likely he was going to need to trade Sophie for the one thing that mattered the most to him.</p><p>She tried not to think about how much that hurt. It seemed everywhere she ended up, she was expendable.</p><p>\u201cWhy Resnick?\u201d she asked hoarsely. \u201cWhy did you lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou withheld information. Same thing.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curled into a snarl. \u201cLet\u2019s not get into withholding information, Sophie. You\u2019ve been holding out on me from the start.\u201d</p><p>She bared her teeth and pushed forward into his space. \u201cExactly what was I supposed to do, Sam? Show up on your doorstep, say hey I\u2019m pregnant, and oh by the way, you\u2019re the father, and since I know how much you hate your potential father-in-law, I shot him down in cold blood and then ran like hell?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking you wouldn\u2019t have been very receptive. I think you would have packed me off to Resnick even faster than you ended up doing. I think you would have backed off me so quick that you would have broken a leg doing so.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and fought the exhaustion that beat at her so relentlessly.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me why, Sam. Don\u2019t answer my questions with accusations. I\u2019m sure we have plenty to accuse each other of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn,\u201d Sam bit out. \u201cSophie, I had to agree to let Resnick question you. He wields a lot of power. I couldn\u2019t say no. It was obvious you were holding something back. Something that scared the bejesus out of you, and Resnick was convinced you could give him information that would help him. Now I see why he thought that.\u201d</p><p>He paused and slid both hands under her neck and delved into the thickness of her hair with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cBut honey, listen to me. Never. Never was there even a remote chance that I\u2019d let him take you away from me. He was there to ask you a few questions. I was there to pacify him by cooperating. I didn\u2019t lie to you when I said I\u2019d protect you.\u201d</p><p>His voice lowered until it was barely above a whisper and no one but the two of them could hear.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you when I said I needed you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in until his forehead pressed to hers. Then he kissed the tip of her nose.</p><p>\u201cYou and I both know we have a lot to work out. But we can\u2019t do it if we aren\u2019t together, Sophie. We can\u2019t do it if I can\u2019t be with you to make sure you\u2019re safe and that our child is protected from your bastard uncle. I need you to trust me and I know that\u2019s asking a lot.\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze until she stared up at him. \u201cI need you to trust me, Sam. You want and expect a lot from me, but you aren\u2019t willing to give me anything in return.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his hand over her cheek and smoothed away her hair. If he\u2019d answered right away, she wouldn\u2019t have believed him. She would have thought he was saying whatever it took in that moment to persuade her. But he stayed silent for a long moment, and then finally, he tilted her head so that their gazes were locked.</p><p>\u201cI do trust you, Sophie. My gut tells me that I believe you, but my head is screaming I\u2019m a fool. I\u2019m sorry if that hurts you, but I\u2019m being one hundred percent honest with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me you believe I never betrayed you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat you know I didn\u2019t whore myself for my father.\u201d</p><p>His gaze softened and he kissed her, just a light smooch to the lips, and then he raised his mouth to press a kiss to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI believe you, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arm around him and burrowed into his chest. He held her tightly against him while she absorbed his warmth and strength.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, Sam.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed her back and dropped a kiss on the top of her head. \u201cI know, honey. I am too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to demand the key. He\u2019ll want me back. I have to go. If it had been my father, he would have already killed your mother, but Tomas will try to trade. He\u2019s desperate. He just wants the key . . . and me.\u201d</p><p>Sam tensed beneath her. His arms tightened painfully around her. \u201cThis is where I need you to trust me, Soph. I\u2019m not handing you and my child back over to that bastard, but neither will I leave my mother. I\u2019ll find a way. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away and braced herself against his chest so she could look into his eyes. All she saw was unwavering determination. She wasn\u2019t as convinced as he was, but she knew he believed absolutely in what he was saying.</p><p>She put a hand on his face and smoothed her fingers over the lines carved deep into his brow. \u201cI know you will.\u201d</p><p>And she prayed with everything she had that he would.</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>THE convoy of SUVs rolled into the narrow alley at the side of the rural hospital. Rio strode from the building, his mouth set into a grim line. He came immediately to greet Garrett and Sam as they stepped from the truck.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Sam demanded.</p><p>\u201cStable. He was awake for a while. A little disoriented. Asked where your mom was. Donovan is with him. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s told him about your mother yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStable?\u201d Garrett parroted. \u201cHe\u2019s still in ICU, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll remain in ICU until the cardiologist releases him. They want to monitor him closely, but they\u2019ve listed his condition as stable. I\u2019m sure the doctor can tell you more than me.\u201d</p><p>Sam reached into the truck for Sophie\u2019s hand and pulled her out beside him. Rio, Garrett and Sam formed a protective circle around her while Steele and the others brought up the rear. When they reached the inside of the hospital, Sam paused briefly to issue a directive to Rio.</p><p>\u201cGive Steele and his team the report. Coordinate your efforts. I want my family safe. We can\u2019t allow another breach in security.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded, and Sam could see the wash of guilt in his eyes.</p><p>He put his hand on his team leader\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, Rio.\u201d</p><p>Rio didn\u2019t react or respond. Sam knew he wouldn\u2019t. He dropped his hand away and curled his arm around Sophie once more.</p><p>\u201cI want Sophie to see a doctor while we\u2019re here,\u201d he said to Garrett as they hurried toward the elevator. \u201cAfter we see Dad.\u201d</p><p>They shoved into an elevator, and Sam pulled Sophie even closer. She trembled against him, and her eyes looked so sorrowful. The same guilt he\u2019d seen in Rio\u2019s gaze he saw in Sophie\u2019s.</p><p>He squeezed her hand. It was all he could offer right now. Words weren\u2019t good enough, and until he could see his dad, his tongue would be so knotted he couldn\u2019t speak anyway.</p><p>When the elevator doors opened and he saw the sign overheard pointing the way to the intensive care unit, fear squeezed his chest so tight he felt light-headed.</p><p>Rio had said he was stable. That was good, right? But he\u2019d had a heart attack. A serious one. Did it mean he could have another? Was his heart damaged?</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to imagine a world without his dad in it. Growing up, his dad had been his rock. He\u2019d been the rock of six rambunctious, rowdy boys, and he\u2019d infused his core values into all of them.</p><p>Be a good man, have honor and integrity, protect those weaker than you, and never suffer injustice.</p><p>Those values had formed the cornerstone of KGI.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d stopped outside the entrance to the family room until Sophie\u2019s small hand circled his and squeezed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The ache in his chest intensified until he felt bogged down with emotion. Sorrow. Fear. Anger.</p><p>Oh God, he couldn\u2019t lose his father. Not Dad. And his mom. Oh God. It took everything in him to stand there, steady, and not break as he stared at the closed door to the room.</p><p>Garrett turned to him, and he saw that his brother fared no better than he did. They were both supposedly so tough. The older brothers. Leaders. Sam felt like a fraud.</p><p>Then Sophie reached out and touched Garrett lightly on the arm. It was a simple gesture that softened some of the raw grief in Garrett\u2019s eyes. Garrett reached for her hand and gave it a quick squeeze.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Sam nodded toward the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go in. I want to see him as soon as I know how Rusty and Sean are doing.\u201d</p><p>When they entered, Sam saw Rusty seated in the far corner, her face splotchy and her arms hugged around her drawn-up knees. Sean was standing across the room, hands shoved into his pockets, and two of Rio\u2019s men stood guard just inside the door.</p><p>When Rusty saw them, she shot to her feet. Fists clenched at her sides, she stormed over to where Sam stood.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you\u2019d keep them safe! You left them!\u201d she accused, her voice ravaged by tears.</p> <p>She turned her furious stare to Sophie and then back again at Sam. \u201cThis is all her fault, isn\u2019t it? She\u2019s the reason you took off and why you left them unprotected. They could die. They could all die.\u201d</p><p>Sam moved from Sophie so she was behind him, and he reached for Rusty. She tried to pull away, but he hauled her against his chest and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>She struggled but he held on, and finally she went limp against him and broke into heartrending sobs. She wept against his neck, and her entire body shook uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Sam said as he stroked her hair. \u201cDad\u2019s going to make it, Rusty. You know how ornery he is. Can you imagine a heart attack ever taking him out? It would require a tank, and even then my money would be on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Marlene?\u201d she sobbed. \u201cThey believed in me. They\u2019re the only people who ever gave a damn about me.\u201d</p><p>Sam swallowed back his own tears and hugged her fiercely. It was the first time he\u2019d ever reached out to Rusty in the almost year she\u2019d been with his family. He and his brothers tolerated her much like a splinter. Annoying but there. They\u2019d indulged Marlene\u2019s motherly fits over her just like they indulged her mothering everyone else in the world. But they hadn\u2019t ever accepted her. Only Marlene and Frank Kelly had done that.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get her back, Rusty. I swear it. We\u2019ll get her back.\u201d</p><p>He led her over to the sofa against the wall and eased her down. She covered her face with her hands as though she were ashamed that he\u2019d seen her cry.</p><p>\u201cRusty, look at me,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>Slowly her chin lifted and her haunted eyes found his.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry. I am too. But Dad needs you to be strong for him, especially now that Mom is missing. I swear to you I\u2019ll bring her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou swore you\u2019d keep us safe,\u201d she said bitterly.</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cRusty, you\u2019re old enough to know that shit happens. Playing the blame game gets you nowhere. If it makes you feel better to blame me, then by all means do so. It won\u2019t change a damn thing, though. If I have to move hell to find my mother, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Tears crowded her eyes again and her face crumpled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just so scared. If I lose them ...\u201d</p> <p>She broke away and buried her face in her hands.</p><p>Sam pulled her against his chest again. \u201cYou will always have a home,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNo matter what.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her head up and stared at him, tears sloshing over the rims of her eyes. \u201cDo you mean that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, really smiled, and it occurred to Sam that it was the first sign of true joy he\u2019d ever witnessed from her. She was always so reserved and on guard. Way tougher than a girl her age should ever have to be.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI need you to promise me something now.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t go anywhere, even to the bathroom, without an armed escort. No exceptions. I can\u2019t focus on getting Mom back if I have two people to rescue. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Her face fell at the mention of Marlene, but she bit her lip and nodded. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He rose, leaving her on the couch. Before walking away, he reached down and squeezed her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. I need to see Dad.\u201d</p><p>Sophie was standing where he\u2019d left her. She was pale, her face drawn, and she looked like she\u2019d have preferred to fade into the wall.</p><p>Garrett was absent, probably gone back to see their father already. Rio stepped into the waiting room, and Sam went to meet him. He reached for Sophie and pulled her into his side when he stopped in front of Rio.</p><p>\u201cWatch over them for me,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019m going back to see Dad and then we have to put our heads together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteele and I are working on it,\u201d Rio said. \u201cSean coordinated with the local and state police and they set up roadblocks within an hour of her abduction. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say they left by air. There were reports of two helicopters in the area and we\u2019re trying to run down information on both.\u201d</p><p>Sam reached up to touch Sophie\u2019s cheek. \u201cStay here with Rio. Don\u2019t go anywhere without him, okay?\u201d</p><p>Sophie looked uneasy as she glanced over at Rio, but she nodded.</p><p>Sam glanced at Rio one more time and Rio nodded. Then Sam walked out of the room and to the door that led to the glass-enclosed rooms in the intensive care unit.</p><p>It took a moment for a nurse to answer his summons, and when he told her he was there to see Frank Kelly, she informed him there were already two visitors with him.</p><p>Sam ran a hand through his hair in frustration. \u201cI just got here. I have to see him. My brothers are with him. I\u2019d like to be there with them. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened and she glanced back toward the nurses\u2019 station. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>He followed her to the far end of the unit, to the last cubicle on the right. She paused at the door and motioned him in.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you stay long. If the charge nurse comes back, she\u2019ll insist on the two-visitor limit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>He nudged the already ajar door and stared at his father lying motionless on the bed, wires and tubes and machines everywhere.</p><p>Garrett was sitting on one side of their dad with a chair drawn up to the very edge of the bed, while Donovan was slumped in a chair on the other side. When Donovan looked up and saw Sam, he immediately got up and walked over.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Sam enfolded Donovan in a bear hug.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Sam whispered.</p><p>Donovan drew away and murmured low, \u201cHe\u2019s woken up a few times. First time he asked for Ma. At first I don\u2019t think he had any idea what had happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d Donovan said grimly.</p><p>Sam closed his eyes. Then he nudged by Donovan and went to his father\u2019s bedside. Garrett looked up, his eyes bleak.</p><p>Sam eased into Donovan\u2019s chair and leaned forward until he grasped his father\u2019s hand. It shocked him how weak and human Frank Kelly looked lying so pale in the bed.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s Sam. Garrett and I are here. Can you hear us?\u201d</p><p>To his surprise, his dad\u2019s eyelids twitched and fluttered open. For a moment he stared at Sam as if not recognizing him. Then his lips parted.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>It barely came out as a whisper. More as a raspy sigh than an actual word but it was the sweetest sound Sam had ever heard. Tears burned his eyes when his dad carefully turned his hand in Sam\u2019s until he could curl his fingers around Sam\u2019s palm.</p><p>Slowly Frank turned his head until he locked onto Garrett.</p><p>\u201cGarrett? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>Garrett leaned forward and grasped his father\u2019s other hand. \u201cI\u2019m here, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Van?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here too,\u201d Sam said. \u201cStanding right here behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your mother back. Don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be fine. You go get your mother. Bring her home to me.\u201d Pain spasmed across Frank\u2019s face and a tear rolled down his wrinkled cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve never been without her. Not in forty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d Sam vowed. \u201cYou just concentrate on getting well so when she gets home you\u2019re not stuck here in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Frank nodded. \u201cEthan and Rachel. Are they safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re fine. I need . . . I need to tell Ethan about Mom.\u201d</p><p>Frank shook his head. \u201cNo. You leave them as far away from this as you can. He has no business bringing Rachel home and into danger. You boys will find Marlene. I have every faith in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dad,\u201d Sam said as the knot grew bigger in his throat. \u201cTake care of yourself please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, son. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>Frank seemed to sag deeper into the bed. His face was gray, and he looked exhausted by the few minutes of talking. Alarmed, Sam called for the nurse. She came in immediately and did an assessment.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s overtired. You really should leave him to rest now.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Sam rose and filed out of the room with his brothers. They gathered in the family waiting room, where Steele, P.J., Cole and Dolphin had joined Rio and his men. Rusty still sat on the sofa, her hands curled tightly in her lap, and Sophie had retreated to the far corner and stood with her arms wrapped around her waist, as if protecting herself and her baby from the world.</p><p>Despite his need to talk to his men, Sam left the knot of people and walked to where Sophie stood. He had a very real need to touch her, to feel her against him. He ran his hands up her arms and then carefully pulled her into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d she asked anxiously. \u201cI mean I know he\u2019s not okay, but will he be?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lightly on the lips. \u201cI think so. He looks bad, and he\u2019s worried about Mom, but I think that worry is what will keep him fighting.\u201d</p><p>Her face fell. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sam. This is all my fault. I should have stayed away longer. I shouldn\u2019t have come at all. I knew ...\u201d She sucked in a wavering breath. \u201cI knew what would happen, that my uncle would come after you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put a finger over her lips. \u201cYou most certainly should have come to me. I don\u2019t even want to imagine you out there still running, hurting, maybe even dead by now. We\u2019ll work this out, Soph. I don\u2019t want you blaming yourself. Put the blame where it belongs. On your father and your uncle.\u201d</p><p>She buried her face in his chest and clung fiercely to him. All his reservations melted away, and all he could see or feel was her. Where she belonged. With him. Him standing between her and the world.</p><p>A phone rang and Sam turned sharply to find the source. The community phone on the wall, the one for the family to use, rang loudly, interrupting the quiet in the small room.</p><p>Donovan picked it up and muttered a hello. His entire body tensed and his expression became dark and forbidding. His hand curled so tightly around the receiver that Sam could see his knuckles whiten.</p><p>Sam stepped away from Sophie just as Donovan extended the phone in his direction.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mouton. He wants to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>SAM heard Sophie\u2019s gasp behind him. A dull roar began in his ears, and he crossed the room to snatch the phone from Donovan\u2019s hand without any realization that he\u2019d done so.</p><p>\u201cSam Kelly,\u201d he barked.</p><p>Tomas Mouton was short and to the point. \u201cI have something you want. You have something I want. If you want your mother back alive, you\u2019ll hand my niece over to me, and you better make damn sure she has what she stole from me.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s lips curled into a snarl. \u201cFrom you? Don\u2019t you mean what she stole from her father? Some would argue it\u2019s hers now. Are you taking over, Tomas? I didn\u2019t think you had the balls to run Alex\u2019s organization.\u201d</p><p>A low hiss was all he heard in response, and then he heard a startled cry. Feminine. His mother.</p><p>\u201cSam? Sam is that you?\u201d</p><p>His heart fell. His hands and knees shook so bad he had to sit down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cMom, are you all right? Has he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was tight with anger. \u201cNo. I\u2019m fine, son. He wants me to tell you to do what he says or he\u2019ll go after every member of our family.\u201d She broke off and there was a muffled sound as the phone was taken from her again.</p><p>Sam lifted his gaze and sought out Sophie, who stood as still as a statue across the room. Everyone else had turned to look at her as well, and she only grew paler.</p><p>Then, as if gathering herself, she straightened. Her eyes went flat and no hint of emotion was reflected in the cool blue. She strode to where he sat and extended her hand for the phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me speak to him,\u201d she demanded in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sam,\u201d Tomas demanded. \u201cLet me speak with my beloved niece.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Sam handed the receiver over to Sophie and watched her expression grow even colder as she put it to her ear.</p><p>He rose to stand beside her, but she turned away, and when he touched her shoulder, she flinched and shrugged him off.</p> <p>\u201cTomas, this is Sophie. Listen to what I have to say and listen well. I have what you want. I\u2019ll bring you the key.\u201d</p><p>Sam lunged for the phone, but Sophie wrenched it from his grasp and backed away as far as the cord would allow. She angrily held up a finger to stop him and glared fiercely, a clear order for him not to interfere.</p><p>He stood there seething, his rage growing with each moment.</p><p>\u201cIf you harm Mrs. Kelly, if you so much as scratch her, I\u2019ll disappear with that key and I\u2019ll destroy it. You\u2019ll never find it. You\u2019ll never have access to my father\u2019s wealth or his dealings.\u201d</p><p>She paused for a moment and seemed to listen to something Tomas said. Sam tried to lean closer, but again she twisted away.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Tomas,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI have nothing to lose. I\u2019ll come to you, but you get nothing until she\u2019s freed. Do we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>She turned back to Sam and slid the phone down to her neck before finally handing it back to him. Sam jerked it away and put it to his ear, only to hear a dial tone.</p><p>He exploded. \u201cSophie, what the fuck?\u201d</p><p>He was furious at her for agreeing to trade herself for his mother and furious because he knew nothing of the deal. No location, nothing. He hated the helpless feeling that gripped him, and he hated being dependent on Sophie for information.</p><p>\u201cI did what needed to be done,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cIf it had been my father, your mother would already be dead.\u201d</p><p>The room erupted in various exclamations and curses. Garrett and Donovan pushed up next to Sophie, and both of them looked as furious as Sam felt.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d Donovan demanded.</p><p>Hurt flickered in Sophie\u2019s eyes for a brief second before she steeled herself once again and any emotion was lost as she stared first at Sam and then the others.</p><p>\u201cTomas isn\u2019t as disciplined as my father was. My father would have killed Marlene to send a message. He didn\u2019t negotiate. He didn\u2019t bargain. He demanded, and if his demands weren\u2019t met, he acted. Tomas is weaker. It\u2019s why your mother is alive. All he wants, all he craves, is wealth and power, and with my father gone, he sees it all at his fingertips. Only I am standing in his way. His sights are on me. No one else matters. Not your mother, not you, not anyone else.\u201d</p><p>She said it so matter-of-factly that it could have been the weather they were discussing. Sam stared at her incredulously. Did she honestly believe he was going to throw her under the bus?</p><p>He stared at his brothers, who were still glaring at Sophie, but now he wasn\u2019t sure whether they were pissed because she\u2019d so readily agreed to the trade or whether they were pissed because she\u2019d taken control out of their hands.</p><p>\u201cThat was a goddamn stupid thing to do,\u201d Garrett all but roared at her.</p><p>She did flinch this time and took a step back. Garrett ignored it and stepped forward until he stared down at her from his full height.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think any of us would just hand you and our niece or nephew over to that bastard? Are you out of your mind?\u201d</p> <p>Now she looked panicked, and her gaze jerked to Sam in a plea for help, only he didn\u2019t feel particularly helpful at the moment. He was too goddamn pissed.</p><p>Even Donovan, who from the beginning had treated her much more gently than Garrett, advanced on her with a deep scowl on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou may not realize it yet, but you\u2019re part of this family,\u201d Donovan all but snarled. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to take down that bastard and rescue our mother, but it won\u2019t be because we handed you over like a bunch of fucking pansies.\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s eyes widened and tears shimmered there, turning the blue to liquid. Sam wasn\u2019t ready to rescue her yet. She needed to hear this, needed to understand what he himself hadn\u2019t been able to say yet. Maybe he hadn\u2019t realized it himself.</p><p>Steele stepped forward, and soon the remaining members of KGI formed a circle around her. She was trapped. Nowhere to run. No place she could deny her value.</p><p>\u201cKGI doesn\u2019t hide behind a woman. Even one as courageous as yourself,\u201d Steele said in his quiet, stern voice.</p><p>Rio glanced at Steele in amusement before adding his own statement to the mix.</p><p>\u201cAnd I rarely agree with anything Steele has to say, but in this I do. You may have never had anyone you could count on in the past, but you do now. And we\u2019re not going to let you do something foolish like walk into a certain death.\u201d</p><p>All the color leeched out of Sophie\u2019s cheeks. She looked stunned. She glanced frantically from face to face and then finally came back to Sam. She looked at him, her eyes pleading. For what? Confirmation? Understanding?</p><p>His heart turned over in his chest. Did she really not think she had any value except as a bargaining tool? His breath caught and held. Of course, she wouldn\u2019t. He hadn\u2019t given her any reason to believe differently. Things had gone so crazily fast in the days since he\u2019d pulled her from the lake that he hadn\u2019t really given her presence in his life any thought beyond the immediacy of the here and now. He didn\u2019t even know if she wanted a place in his life. He hadn\u2019t offered her one. Hadn\u2019t made her believe in her value.</p><p>\u201cSophie, what did Tomas say?\u201d Sam asked gently. \u201cWhat else did he say? About the exchange. Where are we supposed to make it?\u201d</p><p>Some of the light left her eyes, but damn it, he couldn\u2019t tell her everything he wanted to tell her in front of all his men, and their first priority had to be the information.</p><p>Her voice was scratchy, and she wiped at her cheek with the back of her sleeve as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here. In the U.S.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Garrett bit out.</p><p>\u201cMy father owned a large estate in West Texas. It\u2019s isolated and I\u2019m sure the local law enforcement is on his payroll. He moved into places and took over. That\u2019s how he operated. Tomas took your mother there. He wants to make the exchange. We have forty-eight hours.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Sam. \u201cHe wants you and me to go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d Donovan muttered.</p><p>Sam turned to Donovan. \u201cDo we have intel on a holding in Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were two to my knowledge,\u201d Donovan said.</p><p>Sam glanced back at Sophie. \u201cWhere, Sophie? Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRock Springs. Not far from Del Rio and the border.\u201d</p><p>Sam faced his men. \u201cOkay, I want all the intel we can gather on this place. Sat imagery, the local climate, topo maps, the works. I want to know who takes a piss and when, and I want it yesterday. The clock is ticking. Garrett, you and Donovan need to get with Sean and see what kind of local cooperation we can have to keep this hospital locked down and provide protection for Rusty and Dad.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as the weight of their mission settled over his shoulders. The mother of his child\u2014and his child\u2014for the life of his mother? It didn\u2019t even bear thinking about. If he had anything to do with it, it would never come to that.</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d he said as his brother started to leave with the others.</p><p>Garrett stopped and glanced back at Sam.</p><p>\u201cGet on the horn with Resnick.\u201d</p><p>Sophie stiffened and turned away.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and?\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>\u201cTell him to stay the fuck out of our way.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>SOPHIE was shaking so bad she was going to fall if she didn\u2019t sit down. Her senses were shattered, and she needed to get away from the overwhelming presence of so many people. There was no friendly welcome from Rusty, who sat isolated in the corner of the room, and Sam would never let her get a foot outside the door without him.</p><p>She\u2019d never been more scared or more overwhelmed in her life.</p><p>Sam pressed in and put a hand on her shoulder. She jumped and skittered sideways, the light touch hard on her already frayed nerves.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you down the hall so a doctor can examine you.\u201d</p><p>Her baby. Yes, she wanted to make sure everything was okay with her baby.</p><p>Numbly she allowed Sam to lead her from the room. He kept her tight to his side, and they only traveled three doors down to what looked to be a private doctor\u2019s lounge.</p><p>It was empty when they went inside, and he directed her to sit on one of the leather couches that lined the wall. Then he sat beside her and took her hands in his.</p><p>She stared down, watching as his fingers grazed lightly, soothingly over her palms.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor will be here in a moment. I wanted a chance to talk with you privately.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head in alarm.</p><p>He held her gaze, and she was surprised by the tenderness in his eyes. No anger. No judgment.</p><p>Never before had she felt quite so overwhelmed. The events of the last few minutes had somehow unhinged her. She felt so desperately adrift, and she was more afraid now than she\u2019d been when she\u2019d run so many months ago, and kept running.</p><p>Before, she\u2019d had nothing to lose, and now? She stood to lose so much and maybe nothing at all.</p><p>Angered by the tears that slithered down her cheeks\u2014had she done nothing but cry for the last hour?\u2014she scrubbed at the wetness with the back of her hand and looked away so Sam wouldn\u2019t be witness to her awful, gut-wrenching weakness.</p><p>But he turned her back. Ever so gently, he touched her chin and brought her back around. He swiped at one damp trail with his thumb, and his gaze softened all the more as he stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI lied, you know,\u201d she said brokenly.</p><p>He looked startled by her admission. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him and stood, unable to just sit there when every muscle in her body fidgeted uncontrollably. She paced three steps and then stopped, her back to Sam. Her heart raced, and even as she wiped at the tears, she felt the uncontrollable urge to weep more.</p><p>\u201cI gave you a bullshit line about why I killed my father, and maybe some of it was true. But I killed him for my mother. And now because of that, you could lose yours.\u201d</p><p>She turned then so she could at least look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sam. I never meant for this to happen. I never dreamed ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you, honey?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cWhat about your mother? You never mentioned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky,\u201d she said with all the envy in her heart. \u201cEven with all that has happened, you\u2019re so fortunate. You have such a wonderful family.\u201d</p><p>He rose to stand in front of her. He seemed indecisive as to whether he should touch her or not, and finally he just stood there and watched her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t have a family.\u201d</p><p>She slowly shook her head. \u201cMy mother was the closest thing to family, but even she was too cowed by my father to ever do anything to gain his disapproval. He didn\u2019t marry her. He didn\u2019t want me to have his last name. He thought it would be inconvenient were his enemies to ever try to use me to weaken him. Inconvenient. What they didn\u2019t know was that he wouldn\u2019t have cared. He would have never given or sacrificed anything for me or anyone else. But he didn\u2019t want to be inconvenienced. God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh Sophie,\u201d Sam said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHe killed her. And do you know why? He wasn\u2019t angry with her. She had nothing to do with it. She was unfortunate enough to be in the room when a man my father was cutting a deal with questioned whether or not he had the stomach to do what it took to get the job done. Want to know what my father did then?\u201d</p><p>Sam closed his eyes. \u201cJesus, Sophie, you don\u2019t have to tell me this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I do, so maybe you\u2019ll understand, because even I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand any of it. We were eating dinner. He had this asshole over to discuss business. When the man questioned him, he simply pulled out a gun and shot my mother in the head. At the dinner table. And then calmly went back to eating. His only comment? \u2018Do you doubt me now?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, how old were you?\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment because all she could think of was the image of her mother, slumped forward in her chair, the sound of her fork clattering to the table. And the blood. So much blood. It had run onto the pristine white tablecloth. Sophie hadn\u2019t screamed. She hadn\u2019t reacted. She\u2019d known even as young as she was that if she\u2019d made any sound, it was likely her father would have killed her too. Just to make a point.</p><p>\u201cI was ten,\u201d she finally said. \u201cHe went back to eating and then complained because his steak was too well done. I remember being afraid for the cook, but his mood was strangely relaxed, and aside from pushing his plate aside and wiping his mouth, he did nothing more than stare at the man across the table. Then he asked him if he\u2019d like an after dinner drink. They retired to my father\u2019s study while I sat there staring at my mother. I sat there until the maid came to lead me away, and my father\u2019s men then disposed of my mother\u2019s body just like they disposed of everything else in my father\u2019s life that displeased him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lifted her gaze once more to Sam\u2019s. \u201cYou wanted to know why I killed him. I killed him with the same disdain that he once killed my mother, and I killed him so I would finally be free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, baby, I don\u2019t even have words. I don\u2019t know how you survived as long as you did.\u201d He pulled her into his arms and cradled her protectively against his chest. He stroked her hair with one hand and held her tightly with the other. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and inhaled his comforting scent. Hot tears continued to leak down her cheeks, absorbed by his shirt. She\u2019d never cried for her mother. She\u2019d been too afraid. Even in the darkness of her room at night, she\u2019d been too afraid her father would hear. He abhorred weakness, and she\u2019d spent years removing any hint of it from her demeanor.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door, and she quickly stepped away from Sam, wiping at her face in an effort to hide her distress. He gave her a moment, then leaned in to kiss her on the forehead.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the doctor. Have a seat and get comfortable. I want him to give you a thorough checkup before we leave here.\u201d</p><p>She sagged onto the couch and only half-listened as Sam went to the door and spoke in low tones to the doctor. A moment later, an older man walked in, pushing a portable piece of medical equipment, with Sam close on his heels. It didn\u2019t escape her notice that Sam\u2019s hand was on his gun, and he watched the doctor closely when he stopped in front of Sophie.</p><p>\u201cSophie, I\u2019m Dr. Richards. I\u2019d like to check you over, listen to the baby\u2019s heartbeat, and if you consent, I\u2019d like to do a sonogram as well. Just to make sure everything\u2019s as it should be.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he spoke, and Sophie relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cI get to see the baby?\u201d</p> <p>Hope and excitement welled in her chest, and ridiculously, she felt like crying all over again.</p><p>\u201cYes, we can even see if you\u2019re having a little boy or a little girl if you want.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to Sam. He looked a little gobsmacked.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she breathed. \u201cDo you?\u201d she asked Sam.</p><p>Sam circled around the doctor and slid onto the couch beside her. \u201cI do. I\u2019d love to know.\u201d</p><p>The doctor began with a cursory exam of Sophie. He listened to her heart, took her blood pressure, asked her general questions about her health history. He asked to see her arm, poked and prodded at the stitches and seemed surprised that the sutures looked so clean and that there was no sign of infection. Then he asked her to recline on the couch, smiling as he did so.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not the best of exam tables, but Mr. Kelly felt strongly about me performing the exam here and not in one of our rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d she said hastily as she looked right and left to determine the best way to lie down.</p><p>Sam answered her dilemma by simply rotating and easing her down until her head was in his lap. He smoothed a hand over her forehead as the doctor slipped the waistband of her jeans below the swell of her belly.</p><p>There was a muffled sound from the machine as the doctor placed the wand over her belly and moved back and forth. Then he settled on a spot and a rhythmic whop whop whop echoed over the room.</p><p>Sophie yanked her head to the side to see a pulsing blob on the screen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the heart,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cA good, strong heartbeat. Right where we want it.\u201d</p><p>She was mesmerized by the sight. This was her baby! She stared in awe as the image moved. Occasionally the doctor stopped and typed on the small keyboard attached to the sonogram machine.</p><p>He pointed out arms and legs, the head and even a tiny mouth. And then a hand, seemingly held out as if to wave, the little fingers splayed.</p> <p>Sophie\u2019s heart contracted. She was hit by a wave of love so fierce that it paralyzed her. Her child. A tiny life nestled in her womb. She couldn\u2019t even wrap her head around the idea.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here we go. Let\u2019s see here. We have a shy one.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Richards probed harder on her stomach and then turned the wand.</p><p>\u201cAha, there she is. Take a look, Sophie. You have a daughter.\u201d</p><p>Despite her vow not to shed another tear, the screen went completely blurry. A daughter.</p><p>\u201cI was right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cA girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called it right,\u201d Sam said softly above her.</p><p>The catch in his voice had her tearing her gaze from the screen to look up at him. He was staring at the monitor with such awe in his eyes that she felt her chest squeeze a little harder.</p><p>Then he glanced down and their eyes caught and held. He touched her cheek, and the emotion in his gaze nearly undid her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, Soph. Just like her mama.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at the monitor and smiled. The small burst of joy was so welcome, so wonderful that she wanted to hold on to it forever.</p><p>Dr. Richards pulled the wand away from her belly and carefully pulled her pants back up over her waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d leave those stitches in your arm for another few days. Keep the area clean and a bandage over it. It\u2019s healing quite nicely though. Everything else looks good. I\u2019d say you have a healthy little girl there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you so much. It was so nice to see her for the first time.\u201d</p><p>The doctor smiled and backed away from the couch. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two now. I have patients to get back to.\u201d</p><p>He wheeled the sonogram machine away, and a second later, she heard the door close behind him. She tried to push to a sitting position, but it was awkward. Sam helped her up, and she leaned against the couch, suddenly exhausted, but euphoric at the same time.</p><p>\u201cA daughter.\u201d</p><p>Reverently she palmed her belly and rubbed softly over the swell. Sam put his hand over hers and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cI just want her safe,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>Sam cupped her chin and pulled until she faced him. His expression was hard now, devoid of his earlier tenderness. There was determination there.</p><p>\u201cShe will be, Sophie. We\u2019ll find a way. I need you to believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>\u201cHelp me then. I need information. I know you\u2019re tired. But I need you to tell me and my men everything you can about your uncle, about your father\u2019s holding in Rock Springs. Every detail you can think of. They\u2019re gathering intel now and we need to move quickly, but you can help us a lot if you tell us what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the key? I asked you in the truck, but you never answered.\u201d</p><p>She covered her face in a tired gesture, knocking his hand from her chin in the process. She rubbed at her eyes and sighed.</p><p>\u201cThe night I took the boat, when I was coming to you, I hid the key in a box and buried it in the planter that was at the bait shop where I got the boat. It\u2019s there. The Ice Box. That\u2019s the name of the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know of it. It\u2019s a few miles down the lake from Paris Landing. I\u2019ll send one of Rio\u2019s men for it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I should go.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere you\u2019re unprotected.\u201d</p><p>There was determination in her eyes as she stared back at him. \u201cThat key is all the insurance I have, Sam. All the insurance our child has. I won\u2019t take a chance with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I don\u2019t have a right to ask, and you have every reason to be unsure and scared, but trust me, Sophie. Trust me. Trust that I won\u2019t do anything that puts any of you at risk. I\u2019ll send him for the key and he\u2019ll return it to us\u2014to you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, and he could see the conflict so readily apparent on her face. His hand closed over hers, and he felt her tremble in his grasp. Finally she nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, send him.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her hand and kissed her fingertips. \u201cCome on then. Let\u2019s go find the others.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>AFTER issuing instructions to Rio to send a man to retrieve the key, Sam went back in to see his father. This time he didn\u2019t disturb him. He simply stood by his bedside and watched the up-and-down lines on the heart monitor and took reassurance in the rhythmic sounds of each breath.</p><p>Now more than ever he needed to take steps to ensure the safety of his family. It would take months to see to fruition the detailed plans for a veritable fortress on the land he\u2019d purchased, but no longer would he put it off.</p><p>His family would be safe and under his watchful eye\u2014all of them.</p><p>He reached down to touch his father\u2019s hand. It was cold\u2014too cold\u2014to the touch. His mother should be here, sitting by his bedside, not scared out of her mind in some shithole in West Texas.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t prayed in a long time, but he prayed now. He recalled every trip to church with his parents, and knew his mother found comfort in scripture and the steady words from the pulpit. He hoped she reached back for that now and that she didn\u2019t lose hope.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring her home, Dad,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSomehow I\u2019ll make all this right.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked out of the cubicle and came face-to-face with the nurse who\u2019d shown him in earlier.</p><p>She gestured toward a man on one of the phones at the nurses\u2019 station a few feet away. \u201cThe doctor is here if you\u2019d like to talk to him about your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here and I\u2019ll get him,\u201d she said.</p><p>A few seconds later, the doctor hung up the phone and the nurse spoke to him and pointed in Sam\u2019s direction. The doctor walked over and extended his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Caldwell. I\u2019m in charge of your father\u2019s care.\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his hand. \u201cSam Kelly. How is he, Doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing well, considering. He had a major blockage that we went in and stented. There was another artery with about sixty-five percent blockage that we ballooned. He\u2019ll have to be on medication, and he\u2019ll need to make some drastic changes to diet and lifestyle, but he should do well with proper treatment.\u201d</p><p>Relief nearly crushed Sam on the spot. \u201cWhen do you think he\u2019ll go home? I mean is he even near that point? How long will you keep him?\u201d</p><p>The doctor smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep him for a couple of days and monitor his recovery, make sure there aren\u2019t any problems. I\u2019ll run some tests to see how much, if any, of the heart was damaged, but he\u2019ll be able to go home in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>The doctor put his hand on Sam\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNo problem. That\u2019s my job. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I have other patients to see.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded and the doctor walked away. Sam glanced back toward his father\u2019s room before walking out of the unit himself.</p><p>When he rejoined the others in the family room, he briefed Donovan and Garrett on what the doctor had said and then he turned to the matter at hand.</p><p>\u201cSean give me the details on what you\u2019ve worked out for security here at the hospital,\u201d Sam said quietly. \u201cI need every man I can get when we go to Rock Springs, but I also won\u2019t leave Dad and Rusty unprotected.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked haggard, like he hadn\u2019t slept in a week, and grief was raw like a storm in his eyes. Frank and Marlene were like parents to him, and he was another son in an already large family.</p><p>He was young, but he was a damn good cop, and Sam trusted him to keep his loved ones safe from harm.</p><p>\u201cThe state police were screaming, but your pal Resnick called and they calmed down,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Sam\u2019s brow furrowed in surprise, and he turned to Garrett. \u201cDid you know anything about this?\u201d</p><p>Garrett shrugged. \u201cAll I told him was to keep Uncle Sam off our asses and out of West Texas. Figured that\u2019s all he needed to know.\u201d</p><p>Resnick had come through in spades. He was a good man when the chips were down. Sam knew he\u2019d put him in an untenable position. His ass would be on the line with his superiors. But he\u2019d gone out on a limb for Sam. Debt paid.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what else?\u201d he directed at Sean.</p><p>\u201cWe have three troopers assigned to the hospital. I also have two locals and two of my guys from the county. We\u2019ve alerted hospital security, and they\u2019ve called in backup so they\u2019ve doubled their field. I\u2019ll stay with Frank and Rusty myself.\u201d</p><p>Sam inhaled and looked over at his brothers and broached the topic that had been troubling him since their conversation with their dad.</p><p>\u201cI know Dad doesn\u2019t want Ethan involved, but I have to call him. I need Baker and Renshaw, and Ethan will be pissed if we don\u2019t tell him what\u2019s gone down. I wouldn\u2019t blame him. I\u2019d want to know if I was out of town and all this shit had happened, and heads would roll if I was left out of the loop.\u201d</p><p>Garrett grimaced. \u201cI agree, but what about Rachel? If we call Ethan, he\u2019s going to race home, and he\u2019s going to want to go in with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need him,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cRachel could stay with Rusty and Dad,\u201d Donovan offered. \u201cEthan\u2019s going to be in a hell of a position. He won\u2019t want to leave Rachel, but he\u2019s not going to stay behind while we go after Mom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll guard them with my life,\u201d Sean said in a tight, grim voice.</p><p>Sam put his hand on Sean\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know you will, Sean. I just worry about dragging Ethan into this fight when Rachel is still fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, but you\u2019re right, we do need him,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>Sam looked at Donovan for confirmation, then heaved out a huge breath. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll call Ethan and bring him in. The Kelly jet could have him home by morning, and we\u2019ll take out as soon as we have things in hand here.\u201d</p> <p>He looked back over at Sean. \u201cI want Sophie to stay here with you and the other women.\u201d</p><p>He caught a blur of movement from the corner of his eye. Sophie had sat quietly through the entire conversation, but now she leaped to her feet.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI\u2019m not staying here.\u201d</p><p>Sam caught her hand and brought her next to him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t up for negotiation, Sophie. I want you safe. I\u2019m not bringing you into the middle of a war with your uncle.\u201d</p><p>Her pale face crinkled with anger and outrage. \u201cYou\u2019re signing your mother\u2019s death warrant. Whatever your plan is, you cannot go in there without me. The moment he realizes I\u2019m not holding up my end of the bargain, he\u2019ll kill your mother. Oh, he won\u2019t do it himself. He doesn\u2019t have the balls. But he\u2019ll have her killed. Are you willing to risk that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t trade her for you.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand from his and faced him, her mouth set in a fierce line. \u201cI made the deal with him. The key in exchange for your mother. We have to at least give him the semblance of that. What if your plan goes wrong? Are you prepared for the worst? Are you willing to pin everything on your ability to go in and flawlessly execute a rescue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me to trust you, Sam. This has nothing to do with trust and everything to do with me not being willing to be responsible for your mother\u2019s death. How about you trust me? Trust me to know my uncle and know what\u2019ll happen when he realizes he\u2019s not going to get what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Sam closed his eyes. Goddamn but he didn\u2019t want to involve Sophie in any of this. How could he?</p><p>\u201cHow close do you think you\u2019ll be able to get without me? Are you willing to take that chance, Sam? You want me to trust you. Well, I do. I trust you to keep me safe when I go with you. I trust you to come up with a plan that has your men going in for your mother while I face my uncle. You know I\u2019m right. You may not want to take me, but you know you have to. You know it.\u201d</p> <p>Her impassioned plea impressed the men gathered around Sam. They shifted restlessly, and he could see they battled the same dilemma he did. None of them wanted her in harm\u2019s way. They didn\u2019t want her anywhere near her uncle. But they also all knew she had a very valid point.</p><p>And it pissed him the fuck off.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk Sophie and her baby on the off chance we don\u2019t get the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it either,\u201d Garrett muttered. \u201cBut do we have a choice? Do we really want to take that risk? We can protect her, Sam. You know we can goddamn protect her. You don\u2019t want her to go. I don\u2019t want her to go. But do you really want to face Dad and tell him we didn\u2019t do all we could to bring Mom back to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a low blow,\u201d Sam said fiercely.</p><p>Sophie\u2019s small hand slid over his arm and she tugged, turning his attention back to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I get a say in this?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cI brought this to your door, Sam. I brought it to your mother and father\u2019s door. They didn\u2019t get a choice. Let me do this. Let me save your mother like I couldn\u2019t save mine. Do you think I could live with myself if I stayed here and she dies?\u201d</p> <p>Her courage astounded him. It humbled him. He felt wholly unworthy of her selflessness. And as much as he wanted to deny her, as much as he wanted to tie her down if necessary to keep her safe, he knew in his gut she was right. She was right and it made him so furious, so afraid for her that he wanted to break something.</p><p>He stared into her eyes and then closed his. His hands found hers and he hung on. God forgive him, but what was he supposed to do? How did you make a choice between keeping your woman safe or possibly causing the death of your mother?</p><p>Sophie moved against him. He opened his eyes just as she leaned up on tiptoe. She kissed him. A soft, gentle kiss that held a wealth of meaning. And support. It was the first time she\u2019d made any overt gesture in front of the others.</p><p>\u201cI have faith in you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her fingers squeezed his, and she rocked back on her feet. There was more trust in her gaze than he deserved. He just prayed he didn\u2019t betray it.</p><p>Feeling empty, he turned to the others, but he kept a tight hold on one of Sophie\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cWe rework the plan,\u201d Sam said bleakly. \u201cI\u2019ll go in with Sophie. I want P.J. and Cole on sniper duty. As soon as the bastard shows himself to us, I want him taken out. Everyone else will surround and go in. This has to be precisely timed. There\u2019s no room for mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t fail,\u201d Steele said. \u201cWe never have. We won\u2019t start now.\u201d</p><p>Sam pulled Sophie closer to him, needing in that moment to feel her warmth, to remind him of what was at stake. He slid his hand down her body to her belly, feeling for the reassuring kick of his daughter.</p><p>His daughter.</p><p>\u201cThis is your niece,\u201d he said to his brothers. \u201cSophie\u2019s having a girl.\u201d</p><p>He needed them to know. Needed to make it personal, to make this as real to them as it was to him. Then they\u2019d know what was at risk.</p><p>Donovan\u2019s face split into a wide grin. He moved forward, swept Sophie into his arms and spun her around. Even Garrett smiled, and when Donovan set her down, Garrett reached for her hand.</p><p>She hesitated only for a split second before she went willingly into Garrett\u2019s embrace. He hugged her close.</p><p>She seemed shocked by their gestures, and when Garrett let her go, she teetered a little, her eyes glazed.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s half as fierce as her mother, she\u2019ll be a force of nature,\u201d Garrett said in a gruff voice.</p><p>A wry smile curved her lips. \u201cIf you keep this up, I\u2019ll get the idea you actually like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI regret that I ever gave you the idea I disliked you,\u201d Garrett said, his eyes serious. \u201cAnd maybe I did. I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>She stared at Garrett in stunned disbelief. Sam smiled. Garrett admitting he was wrong was a sight to behold.</p><p>Sam held out his hand for Sophie to return to him. She came willingly, and he pulled her to his side.</p><p>\u201cThis has to go right,\u201d he told the men surrounding him. \u201cI can\u2019t lose her.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>WHILE Sam and his men entered the final planning stages, Sophie slept and Sam watched over her. He wasn\u2019t entirely focused on the conversation and the intense strategy session because his gaze kept drifting to the small woman who held such a big part of him in her hands.</p><p>He hated that he couldn\u2019t keep her here, safely tucked away from anything that could hurt her. He despised it. Before, KGI would have planned a ruthless extraction, gone in with precision, rescued the hostage, been in and out in an hour. Wiped their hands, moved on to the next job.</p><p>That had all gone to hell because this was his mother, and if Sophie was to be believed\u2014and he did believe her\u2014her uncle was a wild card. No one really knew how he\u2019d react, because he\u2019d never been tested. He\u2019d never assumed any leadership in Alex Mouton\u2019s organization.</p><p>That made him unpredictable, and they couldn\u2019t afford to risk his mom\u2019s life by assuming anything.</p><p>Goddamn but he hated this.</p><p>\u201cP.J. and Cole will be on sniper duty,\u201d Steele said in a low voice next to Sam.</p><p>Sam turned to his team leader and knew he\u2019d been caught napping. He\u2019d been staring down at Sophie, who was curled on the small couch in the family room, her face tense and drawn even in sleep.</p><p>It was all he could do not to run his fingers over her lips to ease the worry stress, but he didn\u2019t want to disturb her. The next hours would be tense and she needed her rest.</p><p>\u201cYou and Sophie can make nice and meet Tomas for the trade, if the bastard will even show himself. The rest of us will stage around the house and go in. If Marlene is inside, we\u2019ll get her out. If she\u2019s with Tomas, P.J. or Cole will take Tomas out at the first opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows I won\u2019t be coming in with Sophie alone. He can\u2019t be that stupid. He\u2019ll be expecting something. We have to give him something else entirely,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI won\u2019t risk her. I want Garrett and Donovan with me. Protection for Sophie. If I front enough men with me and Sophie, the rest of you might come as a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ethan?\u201d</p><p>Sam blew out his breath. He needed Ethan, but he didn\u2019t want to involve him either. Hell of a note.</p><p>\u201cEthan comes with me. You and Rio will take your teams and take down everyone in your path. It needs to be clean and quiet. The longer it takes for Tomas to figure out you\u2019re there, the better.\u201d</p><p>The door to the room burst open and Ethan strode in, his hand curled tight around his wife\u2019s hand. Baker and Renshaw flanked the couple and were armed to the teeth.</p><p>Sam went to meet his brother just as Donovan and Garrett broke away from the others as well.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Ethan asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s resting. He\u2019ll be okay. I spoke to the doctor earlier.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s gaze dropped to Rachel and he extended a hand. \u201cRachel, honey, how are you?\u201d</p><p>To his surprise she walked into his arms and hugged him fiercely. He responded by enveloping her in a hug. She\u2019d gotten better about expressing affection with him and the other family members, but this spontaneous outburst caught him off guard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou must be so worried.\u201d</p><p>He dropped a kiss on the top of her head and relinquished her to Garrett, who stood impatiently to the side. Garrett and Rachel had always had a special bond, and next to Ethan, Rachel was the most open with Garrett.</p><p>\u201cTell me what the hell\u2019s going on, Sam,\u201d Ethan demanded. \u201cThe report I got was sketchy at best, and I still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening here.\u201d</p><p>Sam caught Garrett\u2019s eyes and nodded for him to take Rachel away. Garrett responded by wrapping an arm around her slender form and guiding her past Sophie and over to where Rusty sat.</p><p>As succinctly as possible, Sam gave Ethan the story from the top. The parts about him and Sophie were abbreviated, but his warning was crystal clear. His brother wasn\u2019t to place blame on Sophie\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Ethan stared dumbly at the couch where Sophie lay sleeping. Then he dragged a hand over his short-cropped hair and shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>His stare was challenging, as if he expected Sam to shoot him down. But Sam nodded.</p><p>\u201cI need you on this, Ethan. I\u2019ve made arrangements for Rachel and Rusty to be cared for. Sean\u2019s going to stay with them, and we have a veritable army around the hospital so they and Dad will be safe.\u201d</p><p>Ethan lowered his voice. \u201cI need to explain to Rachel. She doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, just that Dad\u2019s had a heart attack and there\u2019s trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go explain,\u201d Sam said. \u201cWe leave in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSOPHIE, Sophie, honey, time to wake up.\u201d</p><p>She heard the words, but they seemed so far away. Drowsily, she opened her eyes to see Sam sitting on the edge of the couch, his eyes full of misgivings.</p><p>\u201cAre we leaving?\u201d</p><p>She was proud of the way she kept the fear from her voice, how steady the words came out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we need to go.\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself to a sitting position and took quick stock of the room around her. There were faces she hadn\u2019t seen before. A man who looked a lot like Garrett stood against the far wall, his arms sheltering a slender woman with brown hair. Two other men, heavily armed, stood with Steele. The man and woman must be Sam\u2019s brother and sister-in-law.</p><p>\u201cThe key,\u201d she said and stopped to clear the cracking from her voice. \u201cDid they get the key?\u201d</p><p>Sam reached into his pocket and pulled out a long cylindrical piece of metal.</p><p>\u201cIs this it?\u201d he asked as he turned it over in his palm.</p><p>It was an odd piece. It didn\u2019t at all look like a traditional key. She could understand his skepticism.</p><p>She took it from him and ran a finger over the series of etchings on the outside.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s specially engineered. It\u2019s quite a piece of technology. On the outside, the etchings are the key part. Each groove fits into a corresponding groove in the keyhole. But it\u2019s hollow, as you can see, and on the inside is an encrypted code that is scanned once the key fits the lock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all computerized, and on the end, where you hold it, is a sensor. If the person\u2019s pulse is too elevated or the skin temperature is off the normal body heat by more than a degree, access is denied.\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head. \u201cYour father was a paranoid bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe liked to think he was careful and thought of every eventuality. He didn\u2019t trust anyone. But he was also arrogant. He had such a tight security net around him at all times that he thought himself invincible. He didn\u2019t think anyone could touch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotherfucking God complex,\u201d Donovan muttered.</p> <p>Sophie looked up to see that Donovan and Garrett had gathered, as had the man she assumed was their brother Ethan.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIn some ways he did consider himself a god. Not a deity. He wasn\u2019t a religious man. He had no tolerance for what couldn\u2019t be touched or seen. He considered religion a weakness, and he was all about strength or what he perceived as strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you ever have the nerve to go up against him?\u201d Garrett asked. \u201cYou said you shot him, but how?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to brag about. I\u2019m not proud of what I did. I did it for selfish reasons. I\u2019m not a noble person.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s hand slid under her chin and tilted it upward until she met his gaze.</p> <p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d he said in a quiet voice that almost shook. \u201cYou\u2019re risking your life for a woman you don\u2019t know. That makes you pretty goddamn noble in my book.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened as if just saying the words were unbearable.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find a way to keep me safe,\u201d she said.</p><p>Those weren\u2019t just words meant to reassure. She believed them. And she wanted him to know that.</p><p>Ethan stepped forward and put his hand down to Sophie. \u201cI\u2019m Ethan, Sam\u2019s younger brother. I\u2019ll be going with you to Rock Springs.\u201d</p><p>She gingerly slid her hand into his. \u201cI\u2019m Sophie.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled, and it was startling to see someone who so closely resembled Garrett smiling.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are. My brother\u2019s told me a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>Steele walked up and touched Sam on the arm. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to move. Trucks are here, helicopters are waiting, and the jet is fueled.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach balled into a knot, and she lowered her hands to her lap so no one would see how bad they shook. The key pressed into her palm, and the leather strip that had secured it to her father\u2019s neck lay limply across her leg. Deep red splotches stained one side. Her father\u2019s blood.</p><p>The key had been her insurance policy, but now it was the only thing that stood between Marlene Kelly and certain death. When she gave it up, unless Sam and his men were able to completely bring down her uncle\u2019s network, she\u2019d wear a target on her back for the rest of her life. However long it lasted.</p><p>Sam reached for her hand and pulled her up to stand beside him. His eyes found hers and he touched her cheek in a tender gesture.</p><p>Then he let his hand fall away and tugged her into the protective circle of his men as they walked out of the hospital.</p><p>THEY were climbing into the SUVs when a black sedan roared toward them. The clatter of guns was deafening as every single one of Sam\u2019s men took cover and aimed at the approaching vehicle. It screeched to a halt a few feet from where Sam stood and Sam shoved Sophie into the backseat.</p> <p>\u201cStay down,\u201d he barked.</p><p>He drew his Glock as the door to the car opened and Resnick popped out, hands in the air. Without waiting for a summons, he strode determinedly toward Sam, his mouth set in a grim line.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Adam, I told you to stay the fuck out of our way,\u201d Sam said through gritted teeth. He purposely didn\u2019t order his men to put down their weapons.</p><p>Resnick was smoking like a chimney, and he yanked the cigarette out of his mouth. \u201cI need five minutes of your time, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have five minutes. Get out of my way, Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on a goddamn suicide mission, Sam. Goddamn it, listen to me!\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyes narrowed and he lowered his pistol. \u201cWhat the fuck do you know about where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>Resnick blew out an agitated puff of smoke, then threw the still glowing cigarette to the pavement. It skittered away in a shower of sparks.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a genius. I have access to more sophisticated satellite imagery than you do. Mouton has moved a fucking army into West Texas. Your men are good, Sam. The best. But are you prepared to take on a goddamn army?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you proposing?\u201d Sam demanded.</p><p>\u201cI have two teams mobilized and en route to Del Rio. They\u2019ll coordinate with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Garrett broke in impatiently. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk, do it on the road. We\u2019ve got to make tracks.\u201d</p><p>Sam jerked a thumb at Resnick. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>Resnick hurried around to the passenger seat and jumped in next to Garrett. Sam slid in next to Sophie, who was staring at Resnick like he was a snake.</p><p>Sam reached for Sophie and pulled her close as Garrett roared out of the parking lot. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he murmured in her ear.</p><p>Resnick turned in his seat to look at Sam. His gaze drifted over to Sophie, and a look of true regret sparked in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what happened before, Sophie. I never intended to frighten you.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension faded, and she relaxed against Sam\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cNow, what the hell have you got planned?\u201d Sam asked Adam.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be walking into a massacre,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cA goddamn massacre. It looks like he\u2019s pulled in all his men and maybe some mercenaries as well. Who the fuck knows what third world country owes him enough favors that they\u2019d supply him with military power. There\u2019s probably a dozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Sam swore. \u201cHe\u2019s got my mother. He wants to trade her for Sophie. That\u2019s not going to happen. Our only hope is to go in and take him out.\u201d</p><p>Resnick nodded and stuck a cigarette into his mouth, though he didn\u2019t make a move to light it. He removed it at intervals just like he was smoking it, and his hands shook in agitation. He\u2019d always been a high-strung son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think of you and your men, Sam. But you can\u2019t do this. You\u2019re outnumbered at least four to one. You need to let me even the odds. I have two black ops teams staged and ready to go. They\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you get out of this?\u201d Sam asked bluntly.</p><p>Resnick found his gaze and met it head-on, his eyes glittering with determination. \u201cI want him taken down by any means necessary. Who does it is of no consequence, and if I can aid in that goal, then I\u2019ll do what it takes.\u201d His gaze swept to Sophie and then back to Sam. \u201cAlex is dead, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Sam gave a short nod.</p><p>Resnick\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWho killed him?\u201d</p><p>Sophie stiffened beside Sam, but he didn\u2019t react. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d he asked calmly.</p><p>Resnick shook his head and tore the cigarette from his mouth again. \u201cNo. No, it doesn\u2019t matter at all as long as the bastard is gone.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked at Garrett, who stared back at him in the rearview mirror. For a moment the two brothers didn\u2019t say anything and then Sam finally turned back to Resnick.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet your men in Del Rio. They don\u2019t go in, they do nothing without my say-so, is that understood? Everything goes according to our plan. My mother and Sophie are to be protected at all costs.\u201d</p><p>Resnick nodded. \u201cI understand. I got it. I\u2019ll make the call.\u201d</p><p>Sam relaxed and rubbed his hand up and down Sophie\u2019s arm. \u201cThanks, Adam. We appreciate the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. Just nail that bastard to the wall. That\u2019s my thanks.\u201d</p><p>THEY arrived in Del Rio at nightfall. The Kelly jet landed on a bumpy patch of flat soil that had been commandeered by Resnick\u2019s teams. They flew in dark, and Sophie\u2019s fingers left a permanent imprint on Sam\u2019s hands. When they finally rolled to a stop, she sagged like a deflated balloon.</p><p>\u201cRio and Steele are on the ground already. I\u2019ve notified them of the change in head count. They\u2019re awaiting our orders,\u201d Garrett said as he ducked through the exit and made quick work of the steps.</p><p>He waited at the bottom and reached for Sophie, who preceded Sam from the plane. Garrett set her on her feet and stared at Sam in the dark. Resnick, Donovan and Ethan followed close behind.</p><p>\u201cAdam Resnick?\u201d</p><p>The voice filtered through the small group like a ghost. They all turned rapidly, drawing their weapons.</p><p>\u201cKyle Phillips, United States Marine Corps, sir. My men are here and awaiting your orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow yourself, soldier,\u201d Resnick said.</p><p>There was only a slight shift in the air, and then a dark figure appeared next to Resnick.</p><p>Resnick didn\u2019t waste time with pleasantries.</p><p>\u201cPhillips, this is Sam Kelly and his brothers, Garrett, Donovan and Ethan. You\u2019ll be taking orders from them. This is their mission, but it\u2019s your job to make damn sure they don\u2019t fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Phillips turned to Sam and extended his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you, sir. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Sam took his hand and gave it a quick shake. \u201cI appreciate you and your men coming, Phillips. What information do you have for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll come with me, sir, we have vehicles waiting, a quarter mile over that hill. I\u2019ll give you the report when we\u2019re inside.\u201d</p><p>Sam took Sophie\u2019s hand and Garrett, Donovan and Ethan fell in, surrounding Sophie as they hurried after Phillips. When they reached the line of SUVs, Sam and Sophie got into the vehicle with Phillips and Garrett, while Resnick, Donovan and Ethan got into another.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had the target under surveillance for the last six hours. There was a flurry of movement that ended two hours ago with what we believe was the arrival of his last influx of arms. We have two teams surrounding the house and they\u2019re setting explosives now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they seen my mother?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cNegative, sir. There hasn\u2019t been much movement in the house, and without a man inside, it\u2019s tough to see. It was built with defense in mind. No large open windows, few doors, etcetera. Most of the movement has been on the perimeter. They\u2019re preparing for war. I have three snipers. We\u2019ll position them to do the most damage we can before going in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar is what they\u2019re going to get,\u201d Garrett muttered.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI put my two best sharpshooters for the meeting with Mouton. We could use more around the perimeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re damn good at what we do, sir. I want you to know that. We won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since this whole bloody business had begun, Sam felt a kernel of relief. He lived and died by his faith in the U.S. military and special ops. There weren\u2019t better men anywhere in the world, and he was damn glad to have them with him now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need you to brief your men on what\u2019s going down,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want whatever information you\u2019ve got on the facility and the number of men and their position. I need to know every inch of this place before we go in. You\u2019ll coordinate with Steele and Rio, my team leaders. They\u2019ll have the field. My brothers and I are taking Sophie to make the exchange for my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. We\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Phillips. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks necessary, sir. It\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, a job. He wished that\u2019s all it fucking was this time. Just a job.</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>IT didn\u2019t feel right. None of it felt right. Sam eyed his surroundings as the SUV rolled up the winding, dusty road that led to the front gate of Mouton\u2019s spread.</p><p>Garrett drove and Resnick, who\u2019d insisted on coming along and adding his manpower, rode shotgun. Sophie was squeezed between Sam and Donovan in the middle seat, while Ethan rode in the back.</p><p>He glanced sideways at Sophie\u2019s pale features and saw grim determination in the set of her mouth. Over her thin shirt she wore a Kevlar vest that Sam himself had secured around her small frame. Hell, he\u2019d wanted to cover her from head to toe with body armor. He wanted no part of her unprotected. What if something went horribly wrong? How could he ever forgive himself if something happened to her or their child?</p><p>He was sorely tempted to tell Garrett to turn around so he could take Sophie back. As if sensing his turmoil, Sophie slid her fingers through his and turned her head to gaze up at him. She squeezed and smiled, and that small reassurance hit him in the gut.</p><p>He was a damn fraud. It was his job\u2014his duty\u2014to protect his family, and yet it was Sophie who was determined to protect them all.</p><p>He squeezed her hand back, all the words he wanted to say trapped in his throat. He forced his thoughts to the situation at hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Steele and Rio had joined Phillips\u2019s teams hours before, when night still shrouded the rocky hills. They\u2019d established a tight perimeter around the compound, and P.J. and Cole were in position, their rifles trained on the front entrance.</p><p>It was a mission Sam should have felt good about. Phillips\u2019s teams had evened the odds. He had absolute faith in his own men. This should be a walk in the park. Only this was personal. This was involving people he loved.</p><p>Love. God, he loved her. And it had to hit him now? When he was about to put her in danger? He looked away from her because if he didn\u2019t, he was going to lose it.</p><p>He had to pull it together. He could not go into this with his head so goddamn messed up. He had to forget love. He had to forget about his mother. He had to forget about Sophie, and oh God, he had to forget about his child.</p> <p>Just a job. He had to keep objectivity or he was going to make a mistake and he\u2019d lose them all.</p><p>Only, his pulse wouldn\u2019t slow, and his heart felt like it was going to beat out of his chest. Over fourteen goddamn years of being fearless and stoic in the face of danger, and he was going to fuck it all up now when it mattered the most.</p><p>There were three armed guards at the heavy metal gate. The tension level in the SUV went through the roof. Garrett pulled to a stop and cracked the window.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to see Tomas Mouton,\u201d he said coolly.</p><p>Sophie went rigid next to Sam.</p> <p>The guard\u2019s gaze swept the SUV, and he gestured for Garrett to open his door.</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cTell Mouton we\u2019re here. He\u2019s expecting us.\u201d</p><p>The guard\u2019s nostrils flared, but he picked up a radio and relayed the information. A moment later the gate began to sweep open, and they were motioned through.</p><p>\u201cYou stay behind me at all times,\u201d Sam said to Sophie, though he\u2019d already gone over the plan a half dozen times. \u201cYou don\u2019t move, you don\u2019t do anything until we tell you, and if I tell you to get down, you drop immediately.\u201d</p><p>She nodded but never looked away from the house that loomed closer in the windshield.</p><p>They stopped directly in front of the main entrance, exactly in the location they\u2019d pinpointed so that Cole and P.J. had clear shots to the front steps.</p> <p>Everything hinged on a game of chicken and KGI not flinching first. Sam hoped to hell Tomas was the nervous type.</p><p>Garrett got out first but stayed behind the open door. Resnick popped out on his side, and then Donovan got out on his side and knocked the seat forward for Ethan.</p><p>\u201cStay in the truck until I tell you,\u201d Sam murmured to Sophie as he too opened his door.</p><p>Sam stepped into the morning sun, glad that the light was behind them. He\u2019d take any advantage he could.</p><p>The seconds ticked into minutes until finally the front door opened and Tomas Mouton stepped out, flanked by two guards. He looked nervous\u2014a good sign\u2014and when he caught sight of the men surrounding the SUV he halted, and for a moment looked uncertain.</p><p>Sam stepped forward until he was shoulder to shoulder with Garrett.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my mother?\u201d he called out.</p><p>The two men were separated by a good twenty yards and a row of four steps leading up to the concrete landing outside the front door.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is my niece?\u201d Mouton returned.</p><p>Sam gestured at the truck. \u201cShe\u2019s inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs is your mother.\u201d</p><p>Silence yawned, and Sam said nothing, waiting for Mouton to make the next move.</p><p>\u201cBring her out. I want to see her. If you\u2019re trying to pull something, Kelly, I\u2019ll have your mother executed on the spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a gesture of good faith, I\u2019ll bring Sophie out. That\u2019s all. She doesn\u2019t make a move toward you until I see my mother. Understand?\u201d</p><p>All the air left Sophie\u2019s lungs as Sam backed toward the truck and extended a hand inside. She didn\u2019t hesitate, didn\u2019t want him to witness the terrible fear that streaked through her veins. She grasped his fingers and slid over until she stepped out of the truck.</p><p>\u201cStay behind the door,\u201d Sam directed.</p><p>When he was satisfied with her position, he moved back ahead of her to face Mouton.</p><p>\u201cYou see her. Now I want to see my mother. And she better be unharmed, Mouton.\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s uncle\u2019s mouth drew into a frown. No, he didn\u2019t like threats. She\u2019d seen that look countless times when her father had issued a set-down to his younger brother.</p><p>Tomas ignored Sam and looked directly at her. He had a distinct look of unease on his face. And fear. She could almost smell his fear. His forehead was shiny in the sunlight, and when she looked down at his hands, they were balled into fists at his sides.</p><p>\u201cThe key, Sophie. Show me the key.\u201d</p><p>Not waiting for direction from Sam, she slowly held her hand up, flashing the metal in the sun so he could plainly see the key and the leather band that had secured it to her father\u2019s neck.</p><p>The door opened again and the men surrounding her and the SUV all tensed, each reaching for his gun. The guards at Tomas\u2019s side reacted by drawing their rifles.</p><p>Marlene Kelly came into view looking pale and haggard, but Sophie didn\u2019t look at her. No, her focus was on the man nearly covered by Marlene. The man holding one arm tightly around her neck and pressing a gun to her temple with his other hand.</p><p>Sweat broke out on her forehead. Her palms went damp, and her stomach clenched in a knot so tight she thought she was going to puke.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>She\u2019d killed him.</p><p>Sam froze when he saw the man holding his mother like a human shield. Not much of him was visible, but he could see enough to know he\u2019d been had. Not just had, but truly and royally fucked.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>He glanced sideways at his brothers, but he refused to look back at Sophie, refused to give her or her bastard father the satisfaction.</p><p>God, when he remembered the tears Sophie had conjured as she fed him that sob story about her home life and how she\u2019d shot and killed her father, it made him want to puke. She was good, and he\u2019d been sucked in, hook, line and sinker.</p><p>Was the baby even his or had she lied about that too?</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Garrett muttered.</p><p>It echoed Sam\u2019s own thoughts perfectly.</p><p>\u201cI believed her too, man,\u201d Garrett said quietly so the others wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>Sam went cold. Utterly still, and he turned it all off. Right now nothing mattered but getting his mother to safety.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, Mouton,\u201d Sam called. \u201cLet her go, and you\u2019ll get what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, daughter,\u201d Alex called out.</p><p>For the first time, Sam turned and put his hand out to Sophie in a stopping motion.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t move a fucking inch until he lets her go.\u201d</p><p>Sophie stood, stock-still, her face pale and drawn. Her hand clutched the key, that goddamn key\u2014did her father even need it? Was the whole thing an elaborate ruse to get Sam and his men in a vulnerable position?</p><p>There was too much Sam couldn\u2019t wrap his brain around, but it didn\u2019t matter. His mother did.</p><p>While he was still faced away from Mouton, he ordered in quick, urgent tones, \u201cP.J., Cole, take the goddamn shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not have a shot. Repeat, I do not have a shot,\u201d P.J. said.</p><p>A split second later, Cole\u2019s voice bled through the receiver in Sam\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cNegative on a clear shot.\u201d</p><p>Sam swore under his breath. He turned back to Mouton, ignoring the pleading in Sophie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt would seem we\u2019re at an impasse, Alex.\u201d</p><p>But were they? Did the bastard even want Sophie? Was he willing to sacrifice her to achieve his means? And what was his purpose? Revenge? None of this made any sense. Why go through such an elaborate charade? Doubt crowded Sam\u2019s mind. Had Sophie really betrayed him?</p><p>Pushing aside his emotions, he stared Alex Mouton down. Sam needed to get him talking, needed him to make a mistake so P.J. and Cole could take him out.</p><p>\u201cNo, we aren\u2019t,\u201d Alex said indifferently. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter to me one way or another if your mother dies. Can you say the same?\u201d</p><p>Marlene made a sound of panic as Mouton dug the point of the pistol harder into the side of her head.</p><p>Sam zeroed in on Mouton\u2019s hand, how it tightened around the stock. His finger hovered and then closed around the trigger. He was going to kill her. Right here in front of Sam and his brothers. And Sam was helpless to do anything but watch.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he caught movement. Garrett whirled around, his hands going to his pants just as Sophie shot past him, one of the grenades from Garrett\u2019s belt in her hand.</p><p>And so she\u2019d made her move.</p><p>She yanked the pin and clutched the grenade in the same hand as the key. Only the leather tie was visible, squashed up next to the grenade.</p><p>Her hands trembled and her eyes were wild and fierce with determination. Her gaze connected with Sam\u2019s, and he saw so much pain and sorrow that it sucked the air from his lungs.</p><p>And he knew. Knew in that moment that he\u2019d made a terrible assumption. She hadn\u2019t betrayed him.</p><p>SOPHIE couldn\u2019t breathe. Couldn\u2019t process the nightmare unfolding in front of her eyes.</p><p>Her father was going to kill Marlene. She knew it without a doubt. No matter what happened, he would make a statement. Don\u2019t cross him. Ever.</p><p>She wanted to vomit, but right now she had to be strong. She had to think fast and not betray her gut-wrenching fear. That she could do. She\u2019d hidden her fear and weakness from her father for years. She wouldn\u2019t fail now.</p><p>Holding the grenade close to her now that she was sure her father had seen it, she leveled a cool stare at him and voiced her demands.</p><p>\u201cPut the gun down and let her go.\u201d</p><p>Marlene\u2019s eyes drew up in horror as Sophie walked toward the front steps. Sophie ignored her. She couldn\u2019t think about Marlene or offer her any reassurance.</p><p>\u201cLet her go or I blow us all up,\u201d Sophie said in a voice devoid of the horrific fear that rolled through her body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing,\u201d her father bit out.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d She gripped the grenade tighter, her thumb now numb from the pressure she exerted on the handle. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that I die either way? If I go with you, you\u2019ll kill me. I have nothing to lose. But you have a choice. You can let Mrs. Kelly go and I\u2019ll put the pin back in the grenade and go with you. Or I\u2019ll relax my grip and blow me and you and the key to smithereens. Either way I die. If you let Mrs. Kelly go, you don\u2019t die. Now, what\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p><p>Her father shifted but he was careful to keep the terrified Marlene in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHoney, don\u2019t do this,\u201d Marlene said in a scared, shaky voice. \u201cThink of your baby. My grandchild. Don\u2019t do it. Go back to Sam. For God\u2019s sake, go back to Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Alex Mouton snapped as he angled the tip of the gun harder into her temple.</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Sophie demanded.</p><p>She pulled the grenade up her body until the hand holding it and the leather strap rested against the straps of her vest. Then she tossed the pin onto the porch where her father and uncle stood.</p><p>Tomas swore and immediately dropped down to retrieve the pin. He extended it toward her, his hand shaking.</p><p>\u201cYou put it back in,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cPut it back in now.\u201d</p><p>Her father stared at her for a long moment as if measuring her determination. \u201cAll right, Sophie. You\u2019re calling the shots. If you want Mrs. Kelly to be freed, you come to me and make the trade. You for her. She doesn\u2019t move away from me until you\u2019re close enough to dissuade the snipers.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and took a hesitant step forward. She wouldn\u2019t look back. She couldn\u2019t. If she did, she\u2019d only see what she\u2019d never have.</p><p>When she was close enough to Marlene, she whispered, \u201cTell Sam I love him and that I never lied to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow touching,\u201d her father sneered.</p><p>Lightning fast, he thrust Marlene away from him and yanked Sophie to his chest.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Sophie yelled hoarsely.</p><p>The world around her erupted in chaos.</p><p>Marlene fled toward her sons. The two guards standing on the steps fell, blood running from gaping wounds in their heads. Tomas dove back into the house. Gunfire erupted over the compound. A heavy explosion rocked the ground. Sophie held tighter to the grenade as her father backed through the heavy front door, his arm a stranglehold around her.</p><p>Her last glimpse of Sam was as he rushed his mother into the safety of the SUV.</p><p>She closed her eyes. Thank God.</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>\u201cMOM, Mom! Are you okay?\u201d Sam demanded as he leaned over her in the SUV. \u201cGet us the fuck to cover!\u201d he yelled at Garrett.</p><p>Resnick and Sam\u2019s brothers threw themselves into the SUV and Garrett rocked it over a planter and through a hedge until it dove down a narrow embankment behind a rock outcropping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Sam. I\u2019m fine. Just terrified.\u201d</p><p>Her hands on his face penetrated some of his red haze. He was furious, and he was scared out of his mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have a hostage situation,\u201d he barked into his mic. \u201cSophie\u2019s inside the building. Proceed with extreme caution.\u201d</p><p>Marlene tried to sit up, but Donovan shoved her back down, his body covering hers. \u201cStay down, Ma.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Sam, torment crowding her tired eyes. \u201cSam, you have to get her out of there. She thinks she\u2019s going to die.\u201d</p><p>Sam closed his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cShe told me to tell you she loves you and that she never lied to you,\u201d his mom said in a tearful voice.</p><p>\u201cSweet mother of God,\u201d Garrett said in a strained voice. \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam demanded as his head swung in his brother\u2019s direction.</p><p>Garrett held up the key. It was missing the leather tie, the one she\u2019d held in the same hand with the grenade.</p><p>\u201cShe must have slipped it into my pocket when she nabbed the grenade.\u201d</p> <p>Sam\u2019s gut tightened. He remembered well her determination that Tomas never get his hands on the key. How much more determined would she be to keep it from her father?</p><p>\u201cOh dear God,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill her.\u201d</p><p>Ethan picked himself up off the floorboard of the third-row seat and grabbed at his mom\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cEthan,\u201d she murmured in surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Where is Rachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe, Ma,\u201d Ethan said gruffly. \u201cThank God you are too.\u201d</p><p>Marlene looked anxiously back at Sam. \u201cAre you going after her? You won\u2019t just leave her there, will you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSam, I\u2019ll radio for a helicopter. I can have your mom out of here in minutes,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cYou go. I\u2019ll stay here with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the rest of you to go with Mom,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThis is my fight. Your job is to make damn sure Mom gets out of here alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Marlene snapped.</p><p>Five pairs of eyes stared at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYour brothers would never let you go back in alone. Your father raised you all better than that. You get back there and save my grandchild. You save that young woman who just traded her life for mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ma,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to let the dumbass go anywhere without us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking heavy fire,\u201d Steele said in Sam\u2019s ear.</p><p>The others turned to Sam, their worried gazes finding his.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI\u2019m not letting this bastard take even one of my men\u2019s lives, and I\u2019m damn sure not letting that fool-headed female of mine get herself killed.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE wrenched herself free of her father\u2019s grasp as soon as the doors closed. It felt like the stone being rolled over a tomb. Damn if she\u2019d let fear paralyze her now though.</p><p>Her thumb was slick over the lever of the grenade. It would be so damn easy to let go. But she had no intention of dying, no matter what she may have said.</p><p>\u201cPut the pin back in, Sophie,\u201d her father said.</p><p>Tomas stood, hand outstretched with the pin, sweating profusely and shaking. Alex stared at her through the narrow slits of his eyes\u2014cold eyes that betrayed no fear. Was the man made of stone or was he just that convinced that he was indestructible? For that matter, she\u2019d shot him and yet he\u2019d survived. Maybe he was invincible.</p><p>\u201cI s-shot you.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted into an almost smile. \u201cSo you did. You impressed me. I wouldn\u2019t have thought you had it in you.\u201d</p><p>Then his eyes changed, growing cold as anger flared in the depths.</p><p>\u201cYou put me in the hospital for months. I lay there seeing you pointing that gun at me, an arrogant little bitch who thought she\u2019d won. You can\u2019t kill me, Sophie. I can\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the grenade again when Alex moved in her direction. Her hand shook, but at the moment she didn\u2019t care if she concealed her fear from her father. She was done with it. She was done with him.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me and my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the key and I\u2019ll consider letting you live long enough to give birth to your brat.\u201d</p><p>A burst of hysterical laughter escaped her. He didn\u2019t realize yet that she didn\u2019t have the key.</p><p>Tomas moved, and in that small lapse of attention as she glanced in his direction, Alex rushed her. He grabbed her wrist and twisted painfully until the grenade dropped from her hand to the floor.</p><p>The leather tie drifted downward, and both Tomas and Alex made a grab for the grenade. Alex reached it first, snatched it up and hurled it through the doorway and down the hall.</p><p>Sophie hit the floor, her arms covering her belly protectively.</p><p>The blast rocked the house, and plaster and wood rained down on her head. Recovering fast, she got to her hands and knees and crawled across the debris-covered floor.</p><p>A hand circled her ankle and yanked her back. She rolled defensively and came face-to-face with the furious eyes of her father.</p><p>Dust and bits of the ceiling plaster covered his hair, and he held up the leather tie with his free hand.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bitch, where is the key?\u201d</p><p>Self-preservation kicked in, and she struck at him with her other foot. Struggling wildly against his hold, she fought to gain purchase with her hands, pushing against the floor in an attempt to gain leverage.</p><p>Hope bloomed when she saw him drag his left leg in an effort to keep up with her. His pants leg was ripped from the knee down, and blood dripped onto the floor.</p><p>With another desperate kick, she managed to free her ankle, and she turned, scrambling over the floor toward the doorway on the other side. He was on her in two seconds, his body landing clumsily against hers. The sound of his breathing filled her ears as his hand curled into her hair. He yanked viciously, and when her head came up, he slapped her across the face.</p><p>Stunned, she hit the floor again, only to have him haul her up and drag her toward the opposing hallway. Tomas was down, pinned under part of the doorway that had fallen in the explosion.</p><p>Sophie fought back wildly. She wouldn\u2019t die. Not now. And she damn sure wasn\u2019t going to die at her father\u2019s hands. She aimed a kick at his injured leg.</p><p>Cursing, he struck her again, this time with his fist. The cold metal of a gun brushed across her cheek before he lowered it and dug it painfully into her belly.</p><p>\u201cBe still and cooperate or I\u2019ll shoot you and leave you to bleed out like a gutted pig,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cGive it up,\u201d she gasped out. \u201cYou can\u2019t win. Sam and his men have you surrounded. You can\u2019t possibly think you\u2019ll make it out alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d she demanded as he dragged her through the house. The sounds of gunfire surrounded them, distant, but growing closer. What if Sam got killed? Or his brothers? What if they couldn\u2019t get Marlene to safety?</p><p>God, there were so many what-ifs. Sam thought she\u2019d betrayed him. Would he really put her above the safety of the people he cared most about? She wasn\u2019t as sure as her father that he\u2019d come for her, even if it was his child he was most interested in saving. In the face of her seeming betrayal, it didn\u2019t seem a stretch that he wouldn\u2019t even believe the baby was his.</p><p>Her father shoved her into the library and toward a wooden panel in the center of the room. The doors slid open, revealing an elevator. He forced her inside, then withdrew a key from his pocket and inserted it into the slot below the button for the floor.</p><p>The doors swooshed shut, immersing the interior in darkness. The floor lurched below her and they began their descent.</p><p>All the while, he held her arm in his bruising grip. Her face ached and her mouth had swelled and was split in the corner. The metallic taste of blood hovered on her tongue, but she was alive. She wouldn\u2019t give up hope yet.</p><p>Please, Sam. Find me. Save our child. Save me.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>The elevator stopped and the doors opened to more darkness. Had they descended to hell?</p><p>Her father thrust her forward, and she clumsily stumbled along the hard floor. He\u2019d slowed now, and he limped heavily, his body bobbing into hers.</p><p>She faked a stumble, then let out a cry of anguish. He fell into her, recovered and let out a hiss of pain. But she\u2019d slowed him down.</p><p>Her brain short-circuited. She could only slow him down so much in hopes that Sam came for her. She babbled out the first thing that came to mind in a desperate bid to distract him, make him talk, all the clich\u00e9d things someone did when she was fighting for her life. What else was there left for her?</p><p>\u201cHow did you survive? I shot you. You should have died.\u201d</p><p>Probably not the best thing to do. Remind him of the fact she\u2019d shot him down like he\u2019d shot her mother.</p><p>He remained silent, refusing to be drawn into conversation. His only response was to kick at her ankle to spur her movement. She went forward, pretending to fall. Her hand groped for the wall so she didn\u2019t go down hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying my patience,\u201d he snarled. \u201cGet moving or I\u2019ll shoot you and leave you here.\u201d</p><p>Like a flame to a dry fuse, fury caught fire and burned hot and wild through her veins. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you then? You\u2019re a coward who preys on women and those weaker than you. You shot my mother at the dinner table. What kind of sick fuck does that?\u201d</p><p>He actually paused, his fingers still on her arm. She felt a betraying tremble surge through his body. The cold bastard had reacted? To the mention of her mother?</p><p>\u201cYou think I shot her for some random point?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, but it sounded more like a pissed-off hiss than amusement.</p><p>\u201cYour mother was a whore with no loyalty. Just like you. She betrayed me just like you betrayed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of shit have you been smoking? What could she possibly have done to deserve being shot in the head over dinner for God\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he barked. \u201cShut the hell up and keep walking.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak again, but he twisted her arm until she cried out in true pain. She fell silent and battled the waves of nausea coursing through her gut.</p><p>The tunnel led on forever, but her sense of time had been irrevocably altered by the chain of events leading to now.</p><p>She nearly tripped and went down when her foot clipped a divot in the floor. She registered the sound of a hand sliding over the wall and then light flooded her eyes. She blinked, not wanting to be weak and miss an opportunity\u2014any opportunity\u2014to fight, to escape. To live.</p><p>Her heart sank when she saw two Hummers parked a few feet away and the long tunnel leading out in front of them.</p><p>His hand still wrapped around her arm, he held up his gun with the other hand and pointed it square in her face.</p><p>\u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, she couldn\u2019t get in that truck. She couldn\u2019t allow him to take her.</p><p>A shot roared in her ears. Reflexively she jumped back just as her father hit the truck. His head smacked sickeningly against the passenger window, and for a moment he stood, eyes yawning. Then like a puppet whose strings had been let go of, he sagged and slid down the side of the truck. Blood smeared and streaked a path downward and then pooled beneath him when he finally collapsed to the ground.</p><p>She whirled, expecting to see Sam or one of his brothers standing behind her. She prepared to launch herself toward him, her heart pounding in relief. She stopped short, her feet tangling and catching when she saw Tomas standing a short distance away, gun still raised in the direction he\u2019d shot.</p><p>Her stomach lurched and she fought the urge to throw up.</p><p>She stared numbly at him, not knowing what she was supposed to do.</p><p>\u201cHe deserved a more painful death,\u201d Tomas said in a detached voice. \u201cFor what he did to Maria.\u201d</p><p>Sophie shook her head. \u201cWhy do you care what he did to my mother?\u201d</p><p>Tomas turned his gaze on her, and she shivered at the coldness she found there. All traces of fear had been wiped from his eyes. No tension, no nervousness. It was as if he\u2019d been freed from the one man he feared above all else.</p><p>Wildness blazed and his expression turned triumphant, almost as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he\u2019d just done.</p><p>\u201cHe killed her because she loved me,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cHe found out. I don\u2019t know how he found out. Maybe one of the servants betrayed her. But it\u2019s no coincidence that the day after she gave herself to me, he killed her.\u201d</p><p>Sophie shook her head. The world was crazy. She\u2019d sprung from insanity. Her entire gene pool was one big tainted mess. How could she have ever deceived herself into believing she could lead a normal life when she had lived her earlier life surrounded by crazy?</p><p>Completely and utterly overwhelmed, she sank to her knees and finally all the way down, until her butt hit her heels. She buried her face in her hands and rocked back and forth.</p><p>\u201cGet up and get in the truck,\u201d Tomas ground out.</p><p>Her head flew up and she stared at him in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. You\u2019re as crazy as my father. I\u2019m not going anywhere with you. I don\u2019t have the key, Tomas. You go. They\u2019ll come for you. They\u2019ll be here any moment. If you want to survive, you better get out now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned the gun on her, and where before he\u2019d seemed a nervous wreck, now he seemed frighteningly confident and at ease.</p><p>\u201cGet up now. Get in the truck.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she pushed herself upward, her knees knocking together like rocks. The world tilted and swayed, and she nearly fell over again.</p><p>She stumbled to the next Hummer, fumbled with the handle and managed to open it. Tomas stalked forward, shoved her inside, then slammed the door behind her. He walked around the front, pointing the gun at her through the windshield all the while. Grim determination was etched on his face. Oddly she was suddenly more afraid of him than she\u2019d been of her father. At least she\u2019d known what to expect before.</p> <p>Tomas got behind the wheel, transferred the gun to his left hand and cranked the engine.</p><p>With a roar, he accelerated down the wide tunnel, the headlights bouncing along the walls. After a few moments, the tunnel lightened as sun poured down the passageway. They burst from the enclosure, and dust rose as he wheeled the truck onto the narrow roadway.</p><p>She turned frantically in her seat, searching for direction. Her gaze locked onto the house they\u2019d come from. It grew smaller and smaller as the Hummer streaked through the rocky, arid landscape. Into nothingness. As far as the eye could see, there was nothing but rock and jagged hills.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>WHEN an explosion rocked the house, Sam and his brothers flattened themselves on the ground, and Sam\u2019s heart nearly stopped.</p> <p>Sophie. Grenade.</p><p>Dear God, what had she done?</p><p>\u201cSam, no!\u201d Garrett barked close to his ear.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d gotten to his feet and run for the door until Garrett flattened him. He lay on the ground, Garrett sprawled on top of him, his gut about to explode with what-the-fuck.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Sam, we\u2019re going to do this right, and that doesn\u2019t include you getting your ass shot full of holes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off me,\u201d Sam gritted out. \u201cI have to find her.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of a helicopter landing diverted his attention for all of two seconds as he glanced back to see Resnick hustle Marlene Kelly aboard.</p><p>Relief for his mother mixed with god-awful fear for Sophie.</p><p>Slowly Garrett moved off Sam, and Donovan and Ethan moved up beside them, guns drawn and trained toward the entrance of the house.</p><p>\u201cWe do this together,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cAs a unit. Backup. Familiar concept? As in you go nowhere without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Sam growled. \u201cYou get off way too much giving me orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, when your head is up your ass, someone has to give them.\u201d</p><p>Ethan and Donovan crouched on either side of the entrance. Ethan held up one finger, then two, and when he popped the third up, he and Donovan swung around and bolted inside.</p><p>Sam and Garrett followed, then moved ahead beyond the foyer.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re inside the house,\u201d Sam said into his receiver. \u201cSteele, Rio, give me your status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEngaged,\u201d came Steele\u2019s short reply.</p><p>\u201cComing in from the west,\u201d Rio said a moment later. \u201cCleared our area. Backing up Steele to clear the riffraff. No casualties to report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sam murmured. He hoped to hell he\u2019d be able to say the same.</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d Ethan called from the left.</p><p>Sam, Garrett and Donovan carefully picked their way across the room to where Ethan stood with his rifle up and pointing down a hall.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell,\u201d Donovan muttered. \u201cI\u2019d say this is where the grenade went off.\u201d</p><p>Sam swallowed. His stomach lurched and he swallowed again.</p><p>The room was toast. Rubble was everywhere. The walls had collapsed and the doorway was askew leading into the connecting room.</p><p>Carefully they picked their way through the destruction. Sam hoisted a large section of Sheetrock, but nothing was underneath it except more debris and the floor. He let it fall and continued a path into the adjoining room.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s blood here,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Sam hurried over to where Ethan stood. A beam from the doorway lay to the side, and there was a scraped area on the floor that looked as if someone had been pinned underneath the mess and had shoved their way out. The question was who? Sophie? Her father?</p><p>He glanced around the room, but it was silent except for the staccato of gunfire in the distance. There was no sign of Sophie or anyone else. Which meant she\u2019d survived the blast. He could be thankful for that, at least, but she was still in the grip of her father. And that terrified him.</p><p>They pushed down the hallway, meticulously combing each of the rooms they encountered. There was nothing. No one. Not even hired help. Either everyone had fled or no one had ever been brought in.</p><p>Each time they came up empty, Sam\u2019s hope sank a little further. He needed her safe. He needed her back with him.</p><p>At the end of the corridor, they reached a dead end. But when they turned into the room, guns up, ready to confront Alex and Tomas Mouton, they found only silence and an empty room.</p><p>\u201cWhat have we missed?\u201d Sam demanded.</p><p>His gaze swept the room again, looking for anything that didn\u2019t fit. He frowned when he caught sight of a small splatter of blood on the polished marble. Head down, he searched the area around it, looking for more.</p><p>There, just a drop.</p><p>He followed the sparse sign and came face-to-face with the wood-paneled wood. Deep cherry. Custom crafted. It would have cost a fortune.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Donovan asked.</p><p>\u201cThe blood trail ends here. There\u2019s something behind here. Has to be.\u201d</p><p>Donovan raised the stock of his rifle and rammed the butt into the wood. It held fast, but the thud sure as hell sounded hollow.</p><p>\u201cAmateurs,\u201d Garrett muttered.</p><p>He shoved by Sam and Donovan, pushed them back away from the wall and then fired a series of rounds into the panel. Wood splintered and fell away. Garrett lowered his gun and then stepped forward and kicked at the fragmented wood.</p><p>Ethan joined him, and the two men managed to knock a hole big enough for them to get through. Ethan stuck his head in and then whistled.</p><p>\u201cGive me a light,\u201d he called back.</p><p>Donovan yanked a small flashlight from his belt and thrust it into his brother\u2019s hand. Ethan flipped it on and then shined it inside the hole.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Sam asked impatiently.</p><p>Ethan withdrew. \u201cLooks like an elevator shaft. No elevator though. If they took it down, it\u2019s probably sitting there. Don\u2019t see a way to make it come up, so it probably requires a security code or key inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll rappel down,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Donovan sighed. \u201cI knew you were going to say that.\u201d</p><p>Ethan gave a slight smile. \u201cHaven\u2019t gotten over your fear of heights, flyboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like heights just fine. In an airplane. Or helicopter. I don\u2019t like dangling from a rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Garrett broke in. \u201cSave the chitchat for later.\u201d</p><p>Sam was already in the process of securing the hook around the steel beam that framed the shaft. After he was securely belted and had tested the hook\u2019s hold, he stepped off into darkness and began a rapid descent.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Sam, slow your ass down,\u201d Ethan growled.</p><p>He estimated they were thirty feet down when his boots knocked against a hard surface.</p><p>\u201cThrow a beam down here, Ethan,\u201d he called.</p><p>Just a few feet above him, Ethan turned on the flashlight and directed it down. He landed beside Sam a few seconds later and flashed the light across the surface. They were on top of the elevator.</p><p>Donovan and Garrett landed on either side, and while Ethan held the flashlight, Sam bent down to pry open the hatch. As he pulled upward, Ethan shined the light inside the elevator, and Donovan and Garrett pointed their rifles downward.</p><p>\u201cClear,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>Not waiting for more, Sam threw the strap of his rifle over his shoulder, then knelt and angled his lower body through the opening. He dropped down and waited with seething impatience for his brothers to join him.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, it\u2019s dark,\u201d Donovan said after they pried open the elevator doors. He left the others, and Sam could hear him sliding his hands over a surface. \u201cWe\u2019re in a damn tunnel.\u201d</p><p>Ethan raised the light, but Sam put his hand out and pushed Ethan\u2019s arm down. \u201cDouse the light.\u201d</p><p>They moved stealthily down the corridor. Sam pressed, almost at a run. When they rounded a bend, he blinked as a distant light source came into view. He held up his hand and motioned silently for his brothers to fan out.</p><p>They inched toward the opening, and Sam strained his ears to hear something, anything. As they got closer, the hum of fluorescent light tubes filled the space. Otherwise it was quiet. Too damn quiet.</p><p>Sam and Donovan on one side of the tunnel, Garrett and Ethan on the other, the two pairs faced each other, guns up. Sam held up one finger and then two. On three they burst into the opening.</p><p>Sam pulled up short at the sight that greeted him. A black Hummer was parked several feet away, and to the side lay Alex Mouton. Or what was left of him.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d Donovan breathed. \u201cSomeone blew half his head off.\u201d</p><p>Garrett cocked an eyebrow. \u201cOur girl?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked around and then in the direction the Hummer was pointed, to see another tunnel. \u201cTomas must have her. If she shot Alex, where is she now?\u201d</p><p>Ethan moved in front of the Hummer and stared down at the concrete. \u201cThere was another vehicle here. There are tire marks. Looks like whoever left was in a big hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, I have a relay from Resnick.\u201d</p><p>Sam cupped a hand over his earpiece.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, Steele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResnick\u2019s in the air. Currently tracking a Hummer driving balls to the wall off road toward Del Rio. Kicking up a dust trail and evidently not too worried about being seen. He thinks he saw Sophie in the passenger seat. He\u2019s going to stay on it.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s pulse kicked up. Nervous energy plowed through his veins and made him jittery. He hadn\u2019t felt this kind of adrenaline rush since his first mission.</p><p>\u201cCopy that, Steele. We\u2019re on it. Are you and Rio okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cP.J. and Cole are kicking some mercenary ass. We\u2019re laying low and letting them clean up the stragglers. We\u2019re good. Go get your woman.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked over at Donovan. \u201cTime to show me your skills, tech guy. Get us the hell in that Hummer.\u201d</p><p>Donovan raised a brow, walked around to the driver\u2019s seat, opened the door and stuck his hand in. A second later, the jangle of keys sounded, and Donovan held them up with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cToo easy, drill sergeant.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE bounced and pitched forward as they hit another rise. Tomas was single-mindedly focused on the path in front of them, and she watched closely while the gun inched lower as his attention became less focused on her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t make a sound even when her head smacked the side of the window. The last thing she wanted was to draw his attention to her. As haphazardly as he was driving, it probably wouldn\u2019t take much for that damn gun to go off, and right now it was still aimed at her.</p><p>Where were they going? What could he possibly hope to accomplish? He didn\u2019t have the key. All his \u201cprotection\u201d was back at the house, hopefully getting their asses handed to them by Sam and his men.</p><p>Which left her with Tomas. A suddenly scary thought given the fact that he\u2019d just manned up for the first time in his life and stood up to his brother. The last thing she needed was for him to be high on adrenaline and confidence.</p><p>She glanced nervously at Tomas when he juggled the gun and tried to reach into his pocket, all the while holding his finger way too damn close to the trigger. She was going to die because this idiot was an inept fool.</p><p>He swerved, hit a rock, and his hand fell off the wheel. For a moment they careened dangerously to the right. He swore and yanked the wheel back to the left. Miraculously, the vehicle righted, and they continued on their haphazard trek across the rugged terrain.</p><p>Tomas yanked a cell phone out of his pocket and thrust it\u2014and the gun\u2014in her direction.</p><p>\u201cYou call him,\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou call him and tell him I want that goddamn key or I\u2019ll kill you and his brat.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. She couldn\u2019t help it. An hysterical bubble rose in her throat and escaped through lips that flapped like a fish gasping for air on dry land.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to contact him, Tomas. I\u2019ve never called him. Shouldn\u2019t you know how to call him? You were holding his mother hostage for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>He swung at her with the stock of the pistol, but she dodged and his hand hit the headrest instead. The Hummer swerved again, and something snapped inside her. Sam wasn\u2019t going to get her out of this. Neither was Garrett or the fourteen jillion other men KGI employed.</p><p>If she was going to survive this, if she was going to protect her child, she was going to have to do it herself.</p><p>When Tomas started to swing at her again, she reached up and grabbed his wrist with both hands and yanked as hard as she could. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Curses filled the air. The Hummer swerved, and he grasped the wheel desperately with his left hand to keep control. He punched his right hand back, trying to hit her in the face, but she dodged and then sank her teeth into his wrist.</p><p>She gagged as the taste of blood filled her mouth. He wrenched away and then swung at her with his left hand. As soon as his hand left the wheel, the Hummer hit a huge bump and the world went crazy around her.</p><p>Up became down and down became up. She had the vague sensation that she was in deep shit, and then she closed her eyes and prayed.</p><p>Her head cracked against something hard. Pain speared through her hand. And then suddenly everything went still.</p> <p>Though her head throbbed, she cautiously cracked her eyes open. The Hummer had righted. She looked over at Tomas to see him slumped over the steering wheel. Blood splattered the windshield in front of him and she could see it dripping down the side of his head.</p><p>Her hand hurt.</p><p>Oh God, she was losing it. Was that all she could come up with? She\u2019d just flipped a gazillion times with a man holding a gun, and the only thing that registered was that her fingers ached like a son of a bitch.</p><p>She looked down to see her pinkie and ring finger already swelling. The angle of her ring finger looked off, but her brain was so fuzzed all she could do was stare dumbly at her hand.</p><p>Out. Get out, Sophie.</p> <p>She reached across her body with her left hand to open the door. Let it open. Please. She didn\u2019t want to have to crawl out the window.</p><p>It popped open a few inches and stuck stubbornly.</p><p>She bumped at it with her shoulder but only managed to move it a bit. Swearing in frustration, she rotated her body and leaned back toward Tomas, praying the whole time that the bastard was dead. She braced her feet against the door and pushed with all her strength.</p><p>The metal shrieked in protest, but she managed to pry it open enough that she could get out. Eagerly she scooted forward until her legs stuck through the opening. When she automatically reached for the door frame to brace herself, she hissed in pain and yanked her injured hand back.</p><p>She shook it to try and assuage the horrible ache, and finally opted to rest it firmly against her chest.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>Realizing the vest was in the way and that she had a better chance of squeezing through the opening without it, she fumbled with one hand on the fastenings until she loosened the vest enough to shrug out of it. Then she sucked in all her breath and eased her way between the door and the truck frame.</p><p>As soon as she was clear, she sagged against the beat-up Hummer and blew her breath out in a long exhale.</p><p>Somehow she\u2019d come out of this alive. She took it as a sign that someone was looking out for her. The thought bolstered her flagging spirits, and she stared out over the rocky terrain. They\u2019d driven several miles from the house, and the logical thing to do would be to retrace that path.</p><p>As she pushed away from the truck, she heard the sound of a vehicle in the distance. She put her uninjured hand to her forehead and scanned the horizon.</p><p>A chill went up her spine when she spotted the other Hummer tearing across the rock and sand. She\u2019d seen her father go down. Half the side of his head was gone. He was dead. This wasn\u2019t him.</p><p>Her heart started thumping fiercely. She took one step forward. Her knees shook, and her mouth went dry. She took one more step when the truck hurled over a rise about fifty yards away. It fishtailed, then came to a grinding halt. The doors flew open, and she heard her name shouted.</p><p>Relief poured over her soul like a waterfall.</p><p>Sam.</p> <p>She wanted to run to him, but she was rooted to the spot where she stood like some statue. Sam and Garrett piled out and Donovan and Ethan jumped out behind them. Suddenly their expression changed from concern and relief to horror.</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>\u201cSophie!\u201d Sam yelled.</p><p>Sam and Garrett broke into a run, and Sam yanked his gun from his belt and aimed at a point beyond her.</p><p>Stunned, she turned to see what they were seeing. She recoiled when she saw Tomas stumble from the wreckage. He looked like hell, blood covering most of his face and head. But he took jerky steps toward her, and worse, he had the gun in his hand, and it was pointed directly at her. And she was no longer wearing her vest.</p><p>There was a hollow-eyed, vacant expression hovering over him like gloom. Sophie wasn\u2019t sure he had a clue who he was, where he was or what the hell he was doing, but he had that gun pointed at her, and he seemed determined to shoot.</p><p>She saw his finger tighten and she hunched in on herself, covering her belly as she tried to drop to safety. The shot exploded across the space just as a blur of movement caught her eye and Garrett exploded past her.</p><p>He flew, literally flew, through the air, arms outstretched as he threw himself in front of her body.</p><p>The sound of the bullet smacking his flesh was a sound she\u2019d remember for the rest of her life.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried.</p><p>She dropped over his body just as a second shot exploded through the air. And a third. She didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>\u201cGarrett. Garrett!\u201d</p><p>She raged at him, beating against his Kevlar vest in an attempt to get him to answer her.</p><p>He groaned and rolled to his back, holding up his arms to fend her off.</p><p>\u201cGod, woman, are you trying to finish me off?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. Rage suffused her face until her cheeks burned with heat.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that? Are you an idiot?\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou don\u2019t even like me, Garrett. How could you throw yourself in front of me? What if you die?\u201d</p><p>She broke down as sobs tore painfully from her throat. She lowered her head and gathered his large body as close to her as she could, while she wept on his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy would you do something so stupid?\u201d</p><p>His hand traced gently through her hair, and then he gathered the strands in his fingers and pulled carefully until her head came away from his chest and he could look her in the eye.</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s what family does,\u201d he said in a soft, pain-filled voice.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>SOPHIE stared down into Garrett\u2019s eyes\u2014eyes that were glazed with pain and beginning to fade. Warmth spread under her hand, and she looked down to see her palm pressed to his shoulder. Blood seeped through her fingers and over his shirt.</p><p>No. No, no, no. The bullet had struck him where he wasn\u2019t protected.</p><p>She shook her head in denial as tears coursed down her face.</p><p>\u201cSophie, honey, stop looking at me like that,\u201d Garrett said gruffly. \u201cYou\u2019ll have me convinced I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d she asked in a quivery voice.</p><p>\u201cI hurt like a son of a bitch, but I\u2019m pretty sure nothing vital was hit. That\u2019s what the vest is for.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hand and swallowed in horror at the sticky blood that covered her palm. Then she looked back at Garrett in panic. Was he lying to her?</p><p>\u201cSophie, move away, let me look at him.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see Donovan tugging at her arm, his face grim with worry. She allowed him to pick her up, and then she stumbled away as Donovan bent over Garrett.</p><p>Immediately she was enfolded in a fierce hug. Sam. She went weak with relief.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right? Are you hurt? Talk to me, Sophie. Are you and the baby okay?\u201d</p><p>He ran his hands urgently over her body, pushing, pulling, tugging at her clothing as he searched for evidence of injury.</p><p>Then he reached out and touched her temple, his fingers coming away covered in blood. She stared stupidly at the blood\u2014her blood. She remembered her hand hurting. Not her head. She hadn\u2019t registered that she was bleeding. She stared down at her hand. Garrett\u2019s blood. Not hers.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Sam swore. \u201cEthan, get me something to clean this off so I can see how bad it is.\u201d</p><p>He all but carried her to the Hummer he\u2019d driven up in. He was exceedingly gentle with her as he set her down on the edge of the seat. Her legs dangled over the edge, and she just sat there. Numb. Suddenly exhausted. Worried out of her mind.</p><p>\u201cGarrett shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She stared over to where Donovan was taking care of Garrett and talking into his receiver in urgent tones.</p><p>It bewildered her. Garrett had said it was what family did, but she wasn\u2019t family. Certainly not his family. Was she?</p><p>Garrett didn\u2019t even like her. He had to think she\u2019d betrayed Sam\u2014betrayed them all.</p><p>Sam\u2019s hands shook as they slid up her arms to grasp her shoulders. For a moment he held her there, his fingers firm against her skin. Then he lowered his arms once more and gathered her hands in his.</p><p>She yelped and yanked her right hand from his grasp and cradled it protectively against her chest. She kept her gaze purposely from his. She glanced over at Garrett again and rocked back and forth, cupping her fingers against her.</p><p>They throbbed. Pain streaked up her arm. Her head had started to ache too, and she could feel the warm blood slide slowly over her ear.</p><p>Sam watched and worried as Sophie blanked out the world around her. Ethan appeared with a med kit, and Sam grabbed a bottle of saline and some bandages when Ethan opened it</p><p>\u201cGo help Van with Garrett. Does he have a chopper coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Resnick is landing now.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded and motioned Ethan away. He hadn\u2019t even heard the helicopter. He\u2019d been too focused on Sophie.</p><p>He carefully wiped at the blood that seeped down her temple and ear. She didn\u2019t seem to register what he was doing. Her gaze was fixed on Garrett in the distance.</p><p>When he finally got the area cleaned, Sam thumbed the gash and the knot on her head. It needed stitches. He hoped to hell that was all and that she didn\u2019t have a serious head injury. She needed transport too.</p><p>He tried to pull her wrist away from her chest so he could look at her hand, but she resisted, holding it tense.</p><p>\u201cHoney, let me look at your hand. I need to see how badly you\u2019ve hurt it.\u201d</p><p>He purposely kept his voice low-pitched and soothing. Her gaze was still focused on Garrett, and another tear rolled down her cheek.</p><p>His heart turned over in his chest. God almighty but he loved her. His skin itched and crawled with the need to hold her and comfort her.</p><p>\u201cSoph, let me have your hand, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him finally, and then she glanced down at her hand, confusion clouding her blue eyes. Slowly she extended it, but held it gingerly in her other hand.</p><p>He winced when he saw the two swollen and obviously broken fingers. He gently prodded at her wrist and moved her other fingers. Only the two were injured. It probably hurt like hell, but he couldn\u2019t discern any other injuries. He prayed she didn\u2019t have anything internal.</p><p>He touched a finger to her neck to find her pulse. It was a little erratic, but it beat strongly against his fingertips. Her color wasn\u2019t too bad considering. She was pale, yes, but not deathly so. It was her mental state that was bothering him at the moment.</p><p>Not even the sound of the helicopter fazed her. She just sat there, her eyes vacant, her face dusty and tear-stained.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d Ethan called. \u201cYou need to get her aboard. Mom and Resnick are going to stay with me and Van. We\u2019ll drive out. There\u2019s room for both you and Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Sam gathered her close in his arms and carefully lifted her from the truck. She lay limply against him as he hurried across the ground toward the waiting helicopter.</p><p>Donovan leaned down to take Sophie from his arms when Sam arrived.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Garrett?\u201d Sam shouted.</p><p>\u201cStable,\u201d Donovan yelled back. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped the blood and applied a pressure dressing. He\u2019s hurting like a son of a bitch, but he\u2019ll make it.\u201d</p><p>Sam closed his eyes and inhaled deeply in relief. Thank God.</p><p>Donovan crouched in the helicopter and situated Sophie on one of the seats while Sam climbed in behind him. Garrett was on a litter on the floor, his legs and one arm immobilized.</p><p>He opened his eyes and stared up at Sam.</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>Sam leaned down close to his brother\u2019s ear. \u201cShe\u2019s okay, I think. Thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>Garrett tried to shrug but then paled in pain.</p><p>Sam put his hand on Garrett\u2019s chest and stared down fiercely at the big man.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. I can never repay what you just did for me. You saved . . . you saved my future. You saved my life.\u201d</p><p>Garrett smiled faintly. His mouth worked, but Sam couldn\u2019t hear him over the roar of the engine. He leaned closer.</p><p>\u201cShe means a lot to you, man. I was wrong about her.\u201d</p><p>Sam returned his brother\u2019s pained smile. \u201cSo was I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll set?\u201d the pilot yelled back.</p><p>Donovan hopped out of the back and then gave the pilot a thumbs-up. Sam scrambled up and sat next to Sophie who still stared at Garrett with numb shock.</p><p>Sam leaned in close, touched her cheek, then nuzzled through her hair to her ear.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be just fine, honey, I promise.\u201d</p><p>For the first time she seemed aware of Sam, and she turned her anxious gaze on him. She tried to say something, but he lost it as the helicopter lifted into the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked back down at Garrett so close to her feet. Garrett smiled. Sam knew it had to be difficult when it was obvious he was hurting, but he lifted his free hand up to Sophie.</p><p>She grasped it and Garrett squeezed. He would have dropped his hand back down, but she held tight and leaned over to hold it between her knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he mouthed up at Sophie. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>She only nodded, then grimaced and held up her right hand to show him the swollen, misshapen fingers.</p> <p>Garrett winced in sympathy, but he kept holding Sophie\u2019s other hand as they hovered over the terrain.</p><p>Some of Sam\u2019s anxiety and the tightness in his chest dissipated as he watched Garrett soften toward Sophie. Garrett looked at Sam, and Sam knew his brother had seen the same fragility in Sophie, almost like she was teetering on the edge of a complete breakdown.</p><p>Sam leaned over and wrapped his arms around her. He pulled her in close and slid one hand down to cup her belly. He wanted to feel the reassuring thump of their child, but her stomach was still and rigid.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t borrow trouble and wouldn\u2019t expend energy worrying needlessly. Their daughter had to be okay. Sophie had to be okay.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t live without either.</p> <p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>SAM sat in the chair next to Sophie\u2019s hospital bed with his foot propped on the edge. And he simply watched her sleep. He watched the little red lines feed across the machine that monitored her for contractions, content that for now, all seemed well with their child.</p><p>She\u2019d been poked, prodded and checked over within an inch of her life. Sam had insisted. She\u2019d had a CT scan and multiple X-rays, her head had been stitched up, and her right hand had a partial cast.</p><p>The rest of the family was waiting for Garrett to get out of surgery. The bullet hadn\u2019t been a clean through-and-through. A fragment of it had lodged in Garrett\u2019s shoulder, and they were going in to remove it.</p><p>Sam had already called Sean to get a report on their father and to let everyone back home know that Marlene\u2014and Sophie\u2014were safe.</p><p>He should have felt on top of the world. The nightmare was over. Resnick and company were crawling all over Mouton\u2019s compounds, but Sam had taken the key from Garrett before he went into surgery.</p> <p>Whatever was done with it now would be Sophie\u2019s decision. Sam wouldn\u2019t take that away from her. She\u2019d fought too hard and risked everything to keep it from the wrong hands. He trusted her to do what was right.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>He turned to see his mom standing in the door.</p><p>\u201cHey. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see how she was doing but didn\u2019t want to disturb either of you.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled and motioned her inside. \u201cSophie\u2019s sleeping. She\u2019ll probably be out for a while.\u201d</p><p>He got up, but she all but shoved him back into his seat.</p><p>\u201cYou sit.\u201d</p> <p>He reached for her hand. \u201cHow are you, Ma? Really.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and then smiled. \u201cBetter now that I know my boys are okay. Ethan talked to Rachel. She\u2019s holding up well. Sean said she\u2019s been a rock for Frank and Rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Sean too. He said Dad was doing better. Should be ready to go home by the time we get there.\u201d</p><p>Marlene put her hand on Sam\u2019s shoulder and squeezed. \u201cHow are you doing, son?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment, and he looked over at Sophie, watching the gentle rise and fall of her chest.</p><p>\u201cI love her, Ma. I want you to love her too.\u201d</p><p>Marlene smiled. \u201cI already do. How could I not love someone who so fiercely loves my son? She risked her life for me. She\u2019s a very courageous woman.\u201d</p><p>Doubt crowded Sam\u2019s mind. \u201cI hope she can forgive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive what?\u201d Marlene interrupted.</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t trust her at first. I didn\u2019t trust her there at the end. I thought she\u2019d lied to me. She has to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you torture yourself needlessly over something that may not be, wait and ask her. I think things will be a lot better than you think.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and reached up to cover her hand where it lay on his shoulder. \u201cYou always have a way of simplifying things and making me feel better. Sometimes I feel six years old again, confident in the knowledge that Mom can fix everything.\u201d</p><p>She leaned down and kissed his cheek. \u201cI hope you never lose that, baby. I don\u2019t know a mother alive who won\u2019t always try to make things better for her children, no matter how old they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are going to be changes, Ma. You need to realize that. This . . . what all that\u2019s happened . . . has changed everything. I need to know that you and Dad are safe. That the family is safe.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was achingly sad as she stared down at him. \u201cI know, Sam. And I want you to know something. I want you to know how proud your father and I are of you. Even with everything that has happened, I wouldn\u2019t change who you are and what you do for anything. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made in order to make the world a better place. Your father has always believed that, and he\u2019s passed that ideal on to each and every one of his sons. Yes, your father will grumble and make noises over change, but he\u2019ll accept it with the same grace that he\u2019s always accepted knowing that each of his sons risks his life every day because he wants to make the world safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. Do you know that?\u201d</p><p>She enfolded him in her arms and squeezed. \u201cI know, but it\u2019s nice to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even ask about Garrett. Is he out of surgery? Is that why you\u2019re here now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThey took him to recovery a while ago. They said I could go back when he starts to come around, but they don\u2019t expect that for another half hour or so. I wanted to come check on you and Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t even ask if you\u2019re bringing her home,\u201d Marlene said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body will she go anywhere else,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>Marlene glanced at the monitor with a wistful look. \u201cI admit, I never expected you to give me my first grandchild, but in a way it\u2019s fitting. You\u2019re the oldest.\u201d</p><p>Sam leaned forward. \u201cDid I tell you? Of course I didn\u2019t. How could I? She\u2019s having a girl. I saw her for the first time at the hospital where Dad is.\u201d</p><p>Marlene\u2019s face lit up. \u201cA girl! Oh, won\u2019t that be so much fun. She\u2019ll have you wrapped around her finger for sure.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s chest expanded, and he felt such a surge of anticipation that it made his skin tingle. He imagined a blond-haired, blue-eyed little girl. The spitting image of her mama.</p><p>\u201cThey both will,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>His mother chuckled. \u201cYes, I suspect you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>She patted his cheek and cast one last look in Sophie\u2019s direction. \u201cI\u2019m going to go back to Garrett. I expect he\u2019ll be grumpier than a hungry rattlesnake when he comes around. I\u2019ll need to make sure he doesn\u2019t scare off the nurses with all his growling.\u201d</p><p>Sam laughed and rose to hug her. For a long moment he just hung on to her. She felt very precious in his arms. He had a lot to be grateful for. He owed her life to Sophie.</p><p>\u201cI can arrange to have you go home ahead of us so you can get back to Dad. He needs you.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him fiercely. \u201cRight now my sons need me more. I\u2019m not going home without Garrett. Your father would have a kitten if I even thought of leaving. He\u2019d want me to be here.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away, gripped his arms and stared hard at him. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried about Sophie, but you need rest, Sam. Even a couple hours in the chair would be better than nothing. You said yourself she\u2019d be out for a while.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted. \u201cOkay, Ma. I\u2019ll rest. Promise.\u201d</p><p>After a final pat to his cheek, she turned and walked out of the room.</p><p>SOPHIE opened her eyes, and the first thing she saw was Sam slouched in a chair beside her bed, his head tilted sideways in what looked like an extremely uncomfortable position.</p><p>She was on her side, her casted hand resting on her hip. Her other hand was tucked underneath her pillow. Not wanting to move, she lay there still, watching as Sam slept.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t left her. During the helicopter ride, the landing, the hustle and bustle as the emergency room had run countless tests and the obstetrician had examined her and assured her the baby was doing well.</p><p>He\u2019d been with her through it all, his steady, reassuring presence more comforting than anything she could imagine. No words had been exchanged. They hadn\u2019t had a single moment alone to talk, and now that they were by themselves, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to wake him.</p><p>He looked exhausted.</p><p>Carefully she brought her casted hand down over her belly. To her delight, the baby bumped and kicked and did a little somersault inside the womb. She glanced down, her chest tightening at the wonder of knowing her daughter was alive and well.</p><p>When she looked back up, she was surprised to see Sam watching her, his gaze intense as it drifted to her hand.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He lowered his feet from the bed and sat forward. He rubbed his hand over the stubble on his jaw and then through his hair in a weary motion.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>He scooted the chair closer and cupped his hand over her forehead. He stroked over her hair in a soothing motion, then leaned down to kiss her brow.</p><p>A light fluttery feeling rose in her chest and escaped in a breathy sigh.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Nice actually. A little numb maybe. I feel almost disembodied. I suppose that sounds weird. I feel like I\u2019m up high somewhere. Removed from reality.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her gaze, embarrassed by the babbling.</p><p>\u201cMakes perfect sense,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot. You\u2019re entitled to feel a little out of it. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not hurting. Is our little one moving around? I saw your hand bump a bit when you put it over your stomach.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and then reached tentatively for his hand. She bumped awkwardly against his fingers with her cast, but she clutched on and guided him to her belly.</p><p>His face lightened, and suddenly the gray, tired look lifted as he stared in wonder at his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so amazing. I wonder what she thinks of the world around her. If I were her, I\u2019d want to stay inside her mama where it\u2019s safe forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Garrett?\u201d Sophie asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good. Out of surgery. My mom was down a while ago. They removed a bullet fragment from his shoulder. He\u2019s probably bitching with the best of them right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. I was so worried. I couldn\u2019t have lived with myself if he\u2019d died.\u201d</p><p>Sam moved his hand from her belly and touched her cheek. His thumb brushed across her lips, and he stared at her with so much emotion in his eyes that her belly clenched.</p><p>\u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t have lived with myself if you had died, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Her chest hurt. She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>He pulled away and then stuck his hand in his pocket. He reached for her fingers with his other hand, opened them and then brought the hand from his pocket and laid something on her palm. She looked down to see the key she\u2019d dropped into Garrett\u2019s pocket.</p><p>She sucked in her breath and stared at the shiny piece of metal lying across her hand. Then she looked back at Sam, searching for an explanation.</p><p>He closed her fingers over it and stared intently back at her.</p><p>\u201cYou decide, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Warmth traveled up her body and wrapped around her heart.</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but a knock sounded at the door. To her surprise, Adam Resnick stuck his head in, but he didn\u2019t make any move to enter. Sam looked at her and waited.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she called softly.</p><p>He had an unlit cigarette tucked between his lips and his hands shoved into his pockets as he cleared the entryway.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he said around the cigarette, and then as if remembering it was there, he hastily reached up and snatched it from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Maybe.\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>Resnick nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t keep you long. I just wanted to check in on you.\u201d He hesitated for a moment, glanced over at Sam and then focused back on her. \u201cAnd I wanted to thank you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. \u201cThank me? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did more than you think. Your father\u2019s network is crumbling as we speak. We\u2019ve rounded up dozens of his followers. He and your uncle are dead. It\u2019s only a matter of time before we take apart his system.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her hand, felt the imprint of the key. And she knew what she needed to do. Sam had given her the choice. The freedom to place her trust in whom she wanted. She trusted him. And now she\u2019d trust Resnick to do the right thing. As Sam had trusted her.</p><p>Slowly she raised her hand and extended it in Resnick\u2019s direction. She let her fingers fall open to reveal they key. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Resnick stared at her, his brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cYou\u2019ll find the vault underneath my father\u2019s home in Mexico. In it is everything that made Alex Mouton who and what he was. His wealth. His contacts. And if he was dealing in nuclear weapons, it\u2019s all there.\u201d</p><p>She carefully related the facts she\u2019d given Sam when she\u2019d first told him of the key. Resnick halted her midway through and pulled out his BlackBerry. He typed furiously as she dictated.</p><p>When she was finished, Resnick stared at her with admiration and gratitude reflected in the dark pools of his eyes.</p> <p>He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out what looked like a business card. But when he handed it to her, she saw that it only had a single phone number written in ink across its surface.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can ever do, you have only to call.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the card between her fingers. A great weight lifted from her shoulders. It was over. It was truly over. Her father was dead. Her uncle was dead. Anyone who could possibly harm her or her child was gone.</p><p>She was safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to rest,\u201d Resnick said in a quiet voice.</p> <p>She looked up as he turned to Sam and extended his hand. Sam stood and shook it firmly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI owe you now.\u201d</p><p>Resnick shook his head. \u201cNo. Never that. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded and Resnick walked out the door. When he was gone, Sam leaned over and pressed his lips to her temple.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She turned so that their eyes met and their mouths were just a breath apart.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He trailed the back of his hand down her cheek, and she was struck by the intensity of his gaze. He was so focused on her that on another man, she\u2019d have sworn his expression meant he was looking with all the love in his heart.</p><p>\u201cI sat here watching while you slept, and I went over what I wanted to say to you. And then I realized how much I needed to say to you. I thought about how much we need to talk about. And it went on and on.\u201d</p><p>He turned his hand over and palmed the side of her face. His thumb trailed over her lips, then traced the shape of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut then I realized that all the talking in the world doesn\u2019t change one single fact. It doesn\u2019t clarify it, make it better or worse. It doesn\u2019t change what is.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her heart beating so hard that she could feel her blood pulsing, hear the roaring in her ears.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sophie. I can\u2019t tell you at what moment I fell in love with you. Maybe it was that first time I looked across the bar in Mexico and there you were. Maybe it was the first time we made love. Or maybe it was watching you fight for our child. And then for my mother. It doesn\u2019t matter. I love you. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all. I hope to hell it\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Her heart squeezed. She\u2019d always tried to imagine what it would be like to hear those words. To know that she was loved. Nothing had come close. There was so much joy. It hurt. It shouldn\u2019t hurt, but she felt too small for her skin, like she\u2019d burst right out of it.</p> <p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always imagined those three words being so difficult to say. It was so easy, so freeing. It was the most wonderful feeling in the world.</p><p>Sam smiled, and his voice sounded scratchy and a little hoarse. \u201cI know you do, honey. God, I do know. You\u2019ve proved it time and time again. But thank you for saying it. I needed to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>His elbows were on the edge of the bed now, and their faces were close\u2014so close she could hear each of his breaths. She could feel his nervousness and his uncertainty, and she marveled that she could do that to him. That she could make this man of action be hesitant, even for a moment.</p><p>He tugged her hand from its resting spot over her waist and let it rest over his palm. He put his other hand over the top and rubbed his thumb idly across the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me something, Sophie. What do you want? What do you want most in the world?\u201d</p><p>There was vulnerability in that question. Was he afraid she\u2019d want something beyond him? Out of his reach?</p><p>\u201cI want us to be a family,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI just want us to be a family. You loving me and our daughter. Me loving you. I\u2019ll always love you, Sam. I\u2019ll never betray you.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension fled his expression. His eyes burned. Deep, intense blue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a family, honey. You\u2019ll not only have me and our daughter, but you\u2019ll have brothers. A sister. You\u2019ll love Rachel. And there\u2019s Rusty.\u201d</p><p>At her grimace, Sam smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. She\u2019s a pain in the ass to everyone. You\u2019ll have a mom and a dad. They\u2019re the best and they\u2019ll love you every bit as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and kissed her, his lips melting over hers in the sweetest of touches.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll have me. Always.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach dipped, and she imagined this was what riding on a roller coaster was like. Or flying. Facing into the sun, riding so high that you couldn\u2019t see the ground.</p><p>She wanted to laugh. Wanted to close her eyes and savor this moment forever.</p><p>She was free. Finally free.</p><p>Free to love. Free to live her life the way she wanted.</p><p>Free to choose.</p><p>\u201cI choose you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He smiled and kissed her again. Between them, their daughter rolled once, then quieted as though she didn\u2019t want to disturb the precious moment between her parents.</p><p>\u201cAnd I choose you, Soph. Always you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to live a normal life,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like not to be afraid. I\u2019ve never not been afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t offer normal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can promise you that you never have to be afraid again. You\u2019ll always have me to protect you and our child. Not just me, but my entire family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d Then she laughed. \u201cSee? I don\u2019t know how not to be afraid. What if I screw up?\u201d</p><p>He touched her nose, his eyes serious, and soft with love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you. We\u2019ll take it one day at a time. Trust me, Soph. Trust me to love you and make you happy.\u201d</p><p>She rested her cast on his shoulder and leaned into him until their foreheads touched.</p><p>\u201cOne day at a time. I think I can safely make that promise.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>SOPHIE never got tired of the view from Sam\u2019s dock. She sat at the edge, dangling her feet in the water as the sun slipped lower in the sky. Her protruding belly made it difficult for her to sit too far forward, so she leaned back, bracing her palms on the sun-warmed wood, and turned her face upward.</p><p>Three weeks she\u2019d been here with Sam. Three weeks since they\u2019d come back from West Texas. It had taken a while for everything to sink in. She\u2019d had plenty of time to think during those weeks. The quiet times were good for her soul, but they also gave her time to doubt.</p><p>She rubbed at a spot on her belly where she was convinced a tiny foot poked and then shifted to alleviate its discomfort. Her feet kicked up and she sent droplets skittering across the surface of the water.</p><p>\u201cHey, Soph.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up, shielding her eyes with one hand, to see Sam standing behind her, hands shoved into his jeans pockets.</p><p>\u201cMind if I sit?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and patted the worn wood beside her. He squatted and then maneuvered his legs over the edge of the dock. It was then she noticed he was barefooted and his jeans were rolled up over his ankles.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, but then he\u2019d been extremely patient with her long periods of reflective silence. He seemed to understand that she was struggling to come to terms with everything that had happened.</p><p>They sat side by side, their feet making ripples in the water below. She put her palms down and curled her fingers over the edge of the dock. She tried to make her voice sound casual, like she was embarking on meaningless conversation.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever worry about being a good parent?\u201d</p><p>As if picking up on the worry she\u2019d tried so hard to conceal, he turned and cocked his head, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cAll the time.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand and laced their fingers together.</p><p>\u201cI worry too,\u201d she admitted. \u201cSo much is made of nature versus nurture, but in my case, both aren\u2019t good options. Where does that leave me? How can I be certain I won\u2019t become a monster like my father? I know it sounds silly, but then I remember that I shot my father in cold blood.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into the shelter of his arm and brushed a kiss across the side of her head.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever considered that you\u2019ll be ten times the mother of anyone else because of your upbringing?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI worry so much. Some days I\u2019m convinced I\u2019ll make sure our daughter never doubts for a minute how much I love her. Other days I worry that I\u2019ll screw up her life forever.\u201d</p><p>Sam chuckled. \u201cWelcome to parenthood, honey. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a parent alive who doesn\u2019t have those same fears, no matter what their upbringing was like.\u201d</p><p>She laid her head on his shoulder and absorbed his warmth and strength. \u201cThink so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so. You should talk to Ma. She swears over and over that she screwed up so many times that it\u2019s a wonder any of us boys turned out normal. Dad argues we didn\u2019t and that it\u2019s all her fault.\u201d</p><p>Sophie laughed and enjoyed the loosening in her chest. She relaxed and stared over the water, soaking up the beauty of the perfect day. The sun was beginning to set, and streaks of pink and gold painted the horizon.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I regret?\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s arm tightened around her waist. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we never got to do all the normal things a couple does. You know. Go out on dates. See stupid movies. Go dancing. I used to dream about dancing in a crowded room at New Year\u2019s. Sort of like a fairy tale.\u201d She smiled as the childhood fantasy came alive in her mind. \u201cMe and Prince Charming waltzing as confetti rains down around us, and all the noise and cheering at midnight.\u201d</p><p>She was startled from her daydream when Sam pulled away and got to his feet. She stared up at him in surprise, wondering if she\u2019d made him angry with her silly rambling.</p><p>But he simply stood over her and extended his hand down.</p><p>Still confused, she reached up and let him help her to her feet. Then he pulled her into his arms and pressed his cheek to hers.</p><p>His body moved slow and sensual against hers. In a loose circle, he turned them, swaying in rhythm to the wind.</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes. God, how she loved this man.</p><p>\u201cMarry me, Sophie,\u201d he whispered close to her ear.</p><p>She stiffened and pulled away, shock making her mouth fall open.</p><p>He smiled gently and kissed her open mouth. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t shock you that I want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I ...\u201d She trailed off lamely and blinked furiously as tears threatened.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he said again. \u201cSay you\u2019ll grow old with me, that you\u2019ll have a dozen children with me. That you\u2019ll love me every bit as much as I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He rested his forehead against hers and wrapped both arms around her, until she was molded tight to his body. The baby kicked as if in protest, and they both glanced down at where their daughter lay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life. I love you, Soph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Sam. So much. And yes. I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and she felt a tremble work through his body. She marveled at the fact that he seemed so happy with her response. His entire face lit up.</p><p>\u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>She melted into his embrace as he turned them around. They danced as the last of the sun\u2019s rays slipped over the horizon. They danced to the tune of the gentle waves lapping at the shore. They danced until the stars twinkled overhead and the moon splashed onto the surface of the water like liquid silver. </p> </body></html>"]
