Avelyn's mother wasnot taking the upcoming nuptials well. More to the point,she was notreacting well to thefact that Avelynwould be moving toGervillesoonafterthe nuptials were finished. Avelyn knewher mother was happy tosee her married and starting on grandbabies. It was themoving-away partthat Lady Straughton did not care for. But then, Avelynand hermotherwere very close. Soclosethatrather than be sent awaywhile young, Avelyn had trained at hermother's knee, taught with patience and love.</p><p>\"Oh,\" Lady Margeria Straughton breathedagainas she crossed the greathall,her maid on herheels. Avelyn shared a smile withRunilda, then shookher headather mother and saidwithfondexasperation, \"Do I lookso hideous that it would see you in tears, Mother?\"</p><p>\"Nay!\" Lady Straughton gasped in denial. \"You look lovely, my dear. Very lovely. Theblueof thegown brings out the blue of your eyes. 'Tis very flattering. \"</p><p>\"Thenwhydo you appear sotragic?\" Avelyn asked gently.</p><p>\"Oh. 'Tis justthat you look so... so much a lady. Oh, Gunnora! My babeis a grownwoman now,\" she bemoaned to theservant atherside.</p> <p>\"Aye, milady. \"Gunnorasmiled patiently. \"Andso she is. 'Tistime she married andleftthis home to build her own. \"</p><p>At the maid'sgentle words, Lady Straughton's eyes filled with tears onceagain.</p><p>They were threatening towelloverher lashes andpour down her face when Lord Willham Straughton - who had been seated quietly in a chair bythefire - stoodwith a squeakingof leather and the jangleof mail.</p><p>\"No tears, my love,\" he chidedashe movedto join thewomen by the trestle table. \"This is a joyous occasion. Besides,we hadour Avelyn longer than Ihad hoped. Were itnot for Richard andhis Crusades,we most like would have lost our girlat fourteenor shortly thereafter. \"</p><p>\"Aye. \" Lady Straughton moved to lean against her husband's side as he peered approvingly up at his daughter. \"AndI am ever grateful that wewereallowed tokeep hertotwenty. Howbeit I am going to miss her so. \"</p><p>\"As will I,\" Lord Straughton agreed gruffly. Heencircledhis wife withone arm as heturned tohisdaughter. \"You look beautiful, child. Just like your mother on the daywe were wed. Paenis a lucky man. You do usproud. \"</p> <p>For a moment,Avelyn was startled to see herfather'seyes goglassy, as if he too might cry;thenhe clearedhis throat and managed acrookedsmileforhis wife. \"We shall just havetodistractourselves asmuch as possible from our loss. \"</p><p>\"I can think of nothing that willdistract me from losing our daughter,\" Lady Straughton said dismally.</p><p>\"Nay?\" A naughty look crossed Willham Straughton's face, and Avelyn was amused to see his hand drop fromhermother's waist to cupher bottom throughher skirts. \"I may beable to come up with athing ortwo,\" he said, thenurgedher away from the table andin the general directionof the stairs. \"Letusto our room so we might discuss these ideas. \"</p><p>\"Oh. \"Lady Straughton sounded breathy, and her nextwords,while a protest, weresomewhatweak. \"But Gunnoraand I were going to count stores and seewhat - \"</p><p>\"You can do thatlater. Gunnora may go rest herself for a bit in themeantime,\"</p><p>Lord Straughtonannounced.</p><p>Themaid grinned,then slipped out of the room even as her lady protested, \"But whatof Avelyn? I shouldlike to - \"</p><p>\"Avelyn shall behere when we return below,\"he said as heurged her up the stairs. \"She is notleavingyet. \"</p> <p>\"If sheleaves atall. \"</p><p>Avelyn jerked in surprise at that softly spoken insult from behind her. She managed to keep her perch on the trestle table thanks onlytoher maid's quick action in grabbingherarm to steady her.</p><p>Avelyn murmured her thankstothe girl and turned carefully to face the speaker.</p><p>Eunice.</p><p>Her cousinlooked as mean-tempered as ever. Hernarrow face was pinched,and there was mocking amusementinthe eyes thatraked over Avelyn. \"What do you think, Staci?\"</p><p>Avelyn's gaze moved tothe two young men accompanying the woman. Twin brothers to Eunice, Hugo and Staciushadmatchingpuglike faces thatat the moment bore cruelsmiles. The three ofthem must have enteredwhile she had been distracted byherparents' leaving.</p><p>Grand, she thought unhappily. If Avelyn had been blessed in having loving parents, fatehad made up forthat kindness bycursing her with threeofthe most horridcousins in existence. Thetrio seemed tolive tomake her miserable. They enjoyednothing more than achance to point out her flaws. They had done soever since theirarrival at Straughton some ten yearsearlierwhen their castle hadbeen overrun andtheir father killed. With nowhere else toturn, theirmother had brought herchildrentoStraughton, and they had quickly become the bane of Avelyn's young existence.</p><p>\"Ithink\" - Staci's thick nose turnedup as he droppedontothebench andtipped his head back to peerover Avelyn in her gown - \"once Gervillegets alook at what a bovinehis betrothedhas growninto, he will breakthecontract andfleeforhis very life. \"</p><p>\"Ifear Staci iscorrect, Avy,\"Eunice said with mock sympathy as Avelynflinched under his words. \"You look like agreat huge blueberryin that gown. Mindyou, I do not suppose thecoloris at fault, forin red youlook like agreat cherry andin brown a great lumpof - \"</p><p>\"IbelieveI get the point, Eunice,\" Avelyn said quietlyas Eunice and Hugo joined their brotheronthe bench seat. The warmglow that hadbloomedunderher parents' complimentsdied an abruptdeath. Shesuddenly didn't feel lovely anymore. Shefelt frumpy and fat. Which she was. Only when her parents were around with their unconditional love and acceptance did shebriefly forget thatfact. SomehowEunice, Hugo and Stacius were usually there to remind her otherwise.</p><p>\"Ihave ever foundblueberries lovely and luscious myself. \"</p><p>Avelynturned toward the door at thosesharpwords tofind herbrother Warin closing the door. Shewasn't sure how long ago he had entered,butthe way he glared attheir cousins madeherthink it hadbeen a while. She wasn't sorrywhen the trio scrambledback to their feet and made abeelinefor the door to the kitchens.</p><p>Warin glared after themuntil theywere gone, then turnedto hisdeflated sister.</p><p>\"Do not letthemget to you, Avy. You do not look likea blueberry. You look beautiful. Like a princess. \"</p><p>Avelyn forced a smile as he reached up to squeeze her hand. \"Thank you, Warin. \"</p><p>His expression was troubled, and Avelyn knew he didn'tbelievehe had convinced her. For a moment,shethought he wouldinsist she was lovely, asa good brother would, but then he seemed to let itgo on a resignedsigh. \"Do you know where Fatheris?\"</p><p>\"He went above stairs with mother,\" Avelyn told him; then some of the twinkle returnedto her eyesand she added,\"To discussmethods of distractingher from moping over my leave-taking. \"</p><p>Warin raised his eyebrows, thengrinned as he turned toward the doors. \"Well, if they comedownanytime soon, please tell Father I needa word withhim. I shall be down at thepracticefield. \"</p><p>\"Aye. \" Avely nwatched him leave, then glanced downas her maidtugged at the material of her gown. \"What thinkyou, Runilda?\"</p><p>\"I think we might take itin another little bitinthe shoulders, my lady. 'Tis atad loose there. \"</p><p>Avelyn tucked herneck inand triedto peer at herself. Her view of her shoulders was too close andfuzzyto tell how they looked. She had a better view of her overgenerous breasts,gently roundedbelly andthe hips that she considered to be toowide in the blue gown. A blueberry, Eunicehad said, and suddenlythe cloth Avelyn had chosen with such care lostits beauty in her eyes. Sheimaginedherself a great round blueberry, her head stickingout like astem.</p><p>Avelyn fingered the clothunhappily. it was lovely material. But even the loveliest material could not make a silly old round chicken into a swan.</p><p>\"Milady? Shall I takein the shoulders?\" Runildaasked.</p><p>\"Aye. \" Avelyn let the material drop from her fingers and straightened her shoulders determinedly. \"And the waist as well. And cut away theexcess. \"</p><p>The maid'seyes widened. \"Thewaist? But the waistline fits perfectly. \"</p><p>\"It does now,\" Avelynagreed. \"But it shall not by thewedding, forI vowhere andnow that Ishall lose at least a stone - hopefully two - ere theweddingday. \"</p><p>\"Oh, my lady,\" Runilda began with concern,\"I donot think 'tisa good ideato - \"</p><p>\"I do,\" Avelyn said firmly. Smiling with determination, she stepped down from the table to the bench, then ontothe floor. \"Iwill lose two stone ere the weddingand that is that. For oncein mylifeIwill be prettyand slenderand...graceful. Paen de Gerville shallbe proud to claim me. \"</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>\" 'Tis damned strange. \"</p><p>\"Hmm?\"LadyChristinaGerville glanced up from her meal with surpriseat those muttered words. Her gaze softened as it ran over the man seated betweenherandher husband. Paen Gerville, herson. His long dark hair was caught ina pony-tail low at the back of his neck, his face was cleanshaven, and he was wearing the new forest-green tunic she'd madeforthisauspicious occasion. He looked much as his own father had ontheir wedding day:handsome,strong andjust about as grumpy, she noted withmild amusement. Thenshe recalled what he'd muttered to catchher attentionandasked, \"What is strange, son?\"</p><p>\"This. \" Paen gesturedaround the trestletables filled withpeople. Lordand Lady Straughtonand all theirpeople surrounded them, all but one. The mostimportant one, in his mind. \"Whereis my bride? 'Tis damned strange that she is not here. She was not about when wearrivedlast night either. Something is amiss. \"</p><p>Lady Gerville exchanged an amused glance with her husband, Wimarc, as he turned from his conversation with Lord Straughton to hear the end of Paen's comment.</p><p>\"There is nothing amiss, boy,\" Lord Wimarc Gerville assured hisson. \"No doubt thegirl is delayed by... er... beautifying-typethings. Typical female stuff. Women are always the last to arrive,\" heassured him. Then, catching the way his wife's eyes narrowedwith displeasure, the older man cleared his throat and sent an apologetic smile her way for slandering thewholeofher gender. \"Well, anyway, justrefrain from _worrying. 'Tisjust thoseweddingjitters Iwarned you about. They are playing havoc with you. \"</p><p>He concluded this bit of encouragement by givinghis sonwhat heconsideredto bea gentle supportivenudge. Thatnudge nearly sent his largeson flying backward off thebench, but Paen - used to his father's affectionate thumps and bumps - grabbed at the table andwas able tosave himself fromending in an ignoble heap in the rushes.</p><p>Grunting ashe settled backin place, Paenpicked up apieceof cheese and took a bite, buthe was distracted. His gazewas locked onthestairs heexpected his bride to descend anymoment. He knew his fatherwas right and thathe was unusually nervous, butPaen had noideawhy. The uneasiness hadcomeupon him suddenly.</p><p>He hadn't been the leastuncertain on the way here. In his mind there had been nothingtobe uncertain about. He was merely collecting his betrothed,making her his wife.</p><p>True, it was a new venture forhim, but 'twas not muchdifferentfrom collecting a new squire, which was something else he had to do on this trip. He planned tomarry the girl,spend a few days at Straughton afterward, then head back to Gerville, stoppingto collect his new squire along the way. Simple. 'Twasnothing to get all worked up about.</p><p>Or so he'dthought on thejourney her eyesterday. This morning,however, Paen wasofadifferent mind. It had suddenly occurredto him that a wifemight be a somewhat different proposition from a squire. After all, a man needn't bed his squire. He also didn't haveto live out his life withthe squire for however long he shouldbefortunateenough - or unfortunate enough as the case might be - to live.</p><p>And,too, he could always dismiss the squireif he displeased him. Unfortunately, onecould notdismiss a wife, no matter how badshe was.</p><p>On top ofall that, hehadyet toset eyes on his would-be bride. Italmost seemed thatshe wasavoidinghim. He foundit hardtoimagine that was agoodsign.</p><p>\"Suckin your breatha bit more, my lady. \"</p><p>\"I cannot, Runilda. This is as muchas I can suck in. \" Avelyn pushed thewords out on thelast of the air in her lungs,thenhadtoinhale to ask, \"How close are we?\"</p><p>The maid'shesitation was answer enough. Ave-lyn let her breath out on adefeated sigh. \" Tis no use, Runilda. I shall not get thisgown on, and we bothknow it. 'Sides, even did I manage the chore, no doubt the seams would split the moment you finished fastening the hooks. \"</p><p>\"I am sorry, mylady. Ishould nothave taken it in so much. \" Runildastepped around in frontof Avelyn, her face aportrait ofguilt.</p><p>\" 'Tis notyour fault. Iordered it done. \"Avelyn sank onto the end of the bed,her mind searching foroptions. There were very few that she couldsee. She had notlost two stone inthe last two weeks. In fact, despite all her determination and best efforts,Avelyn very much feared that she might have gained apound or two. The lovely blue gown she and Runilda had workedso hard over would not fit.</p><p>On the bright side,shesupposedshe'd nolonger need fear lookinglikeagiant blueberry on this, her wedding day. Unfortunately, that left her withthe choice of resembling a large cherry or apile of - \"Perhapswecould let theseams back out,\" Runildasuggested doubtfully, but Avelyn knew that was impossible. She'dinsisted the clothbecut away to ensureher successat losing weight. She wasan idiot.</p><p>If she had at least triedthegown onsooner, there would havebeen a chanceto do something about it. But she hadn't. Therehadbeensomuch todo to prepare for thewedding and the influx of guestsattending it, shehadn't thought of hergown or the factthatshe'daskedRunilda to take it in. She was a fool. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Forcingaway her misery and self-pity, Avelynstood and beganto struggle out of the dress.</p><p>\"Well, it shall havetobe the red gownthen. Tistheone with the least wear. \" She tried not to thinkof thereason for that. Thelast thing she neededwas tofret over its unfortunate effectof turning her face florid. Fortunately, Runilda was kind enough not to bringupthatpoint and merely murmured a heartbroken, \"Oh, my lady. \"</p><p>Hearing the tremblein the young maid's voice,Avelyn stiffenedher spine. \"Here, now. No crying, Runilda, else you shall start me cryingas well. \"</p> <p>Avelyn turned away from the maid's tragic face, determined that she would withstand this disasterwith all the dignity andaplomb she could muster. She would not cry. Evenif Lord PaenGervilleshould rejecther onsight, she wouldholdher headhighandkeepa calm and unaffectedfacade.</p><p>Avelyn moved to her chest and sorted throughits contents until she found the red gown inquestion. Her mouth twisted asshe touched the softcloth. She'dthought it theloveliest material she'd ever seen when the traveling merchant had brought it out of his wagon. Avelyn hadimagined the cool cloth cutinsimple lines,flowing over herbodyin caressingwaves. Of course, she'd imaginedherself leanandlovely in the gown - an imagethat had stayed in her head even once the gown was finished.</p><p>Avelyn had felt more than beautiful on first donningit... thenshe'd gone below for the sup.</p><p>Hugo, Stacius and Eunice had been quick to help clear her vision. Their caustic commentsand cruel words had sliced at her pride andpleasurein the new gown, leaving herfeeling large and ungainly. It was Eunice who had pointed out that the color had an unfortunate effect on her complexion. Hugo had laughed and commented that he'd hardly noticed, what with herlooking likea large cherry in the gown.</p><p>Avelyn had never worn itagain. Hencethe reason it was like new.</p> <p>It was to be hoped thatPaen Gerville was partial tocherries, she thought with a touch ofself-mockeryas she lifted thegownout of the chest and gave it a sharp snap.</p><p>Most ofher gowns - including this one - had beenpacked away for thejourney to Gerville. Avelyngrimacedover its wrinkled state,then shrugged inwardly. She was sure a few wrinkles wouldhardly be noticed amidsthervast girth.</p><p>Shetriednot to thinkon how much she'd come to hate the gown. Runildahad just finished fastening it for her when the bedchamber door opened.</p><p>\"Avelyn!\" her mother cried. \"What areyou doing?You arenot evenin your dress yet! Paen is impatient to meet with youbefore thewedding. \"</p><p>\"What is he like?\" Avelyn asked asher mother hurried to herside. The Gervilles were supposed to have reached Straughtonearly the day before, giving Avelynand Paen at leasta little time tobecome acquainted. However,the day had passedwith no sign of herbetrothed andhis party. Most of the other guests had arrivedand been settled in beforea messenger hadarrived withthe news thatthere had been a mishap with one of the Gervilles'wagons and they were delayed. Avelyn had already beenabed when they finally arrived atStraughton.</p><p>If she were tobe honest, Avelyn had been relievedat the delay in havingto present herself before her betrothed. Her cousins'taunts that he wouldsurely reject her the moment he laid eyes on her had haunted Avelyn these last two weeks. And each time she consideredthe possibility, she felt queasywithanxiety.</p> <p>\"He seems very nice,\" her motherassuredher. \"In fact, he reminds me a great deal of your father when younger. Now, come. We must get you into the blue gown. \"</p><p>Avelyn forceda smilefor her mother. \"Ihave decided to wear this gowninstead. \"</p><p>\"What?\" Lady Straughton stopped, her dismayed gaze traveling over Avelyn.</p><p>\"Nay! But why? The blue gown looks so lovely on you, and this oneis wrinkled. \"</p><p>Her mouth firmed and she shook her head. \"Nay. Youmust wear theblue. \"</p><p>\"It doesnot fit,\" Avelynadmitted as hermother grabbed up the bluegownand approached.</p><p>\"Of course it does. I saw you init but a fortnightpast. It fit beautifully. You lookedlovely. \"</p><p>Avelyn could notkeep the doubt from her expression atthis claim, but merely confessed unhappily, \"I had Runilda take itin andcut away the excess. I hopedto lose weightere the wedding, but - \"</p> <p>\"Oh, Avelyn!\" Lady Straughton's hands dropped with disappointment, the precious gown nowdangling fromherfingers and poolingonthe rush-covered floor.</p><p>Shame washing over her,Avelyn started to turn away, but her mothercaughther arm, drawing her into awarm embrace. \"On, Avelyn,how I wish youwouldnot fret soover your shape. You are beautiful just as youare. Why doyou suffer so over it?\"</p><p>\"BecauseI am a greatcow, Mother, and would haveit otherwise. \"</p><p>Much to Avelyn'samazement, hermotherhissed a curse word as she released her. Whenshe steppedback therewas anger in the woman's eyes and her lipshad thinned with displeasure. \"I ought tohide Hugo, Stacius and Eunice. Honestly! I knowthey are behindthis. Thosethree - \" She suddenly fellsilent and a struggle took place on herface; then she calmed and shook her head. \"Never mind. You are nocow, Avelyn. You arepleasingly plump. Men prefer their women that way. \"</p><p>Avelyn snorted,but her mother ignored her.</p><p>\"You cannot wear thered. Tis too wrinkled. \"LadyStraughton's gaze droppedto the blue gown danglingfrom her fingers. \"Ihavean idea. Butwe shall have to hurry.</p><p>They are readytostart forthe churchand are waiting only for you. Take off the red gown,\"she instructed, thenturned to Runilda. \"Go fetch Gunnora. Tell herto find that length of white linen we purchasedfrom the travelingmerchant and hurry back here. \"</p><p>\"What are you thinking, Mother?\" Avelyn asked anxiously asshe shrugged out of the redgown.</p><p>\"Weare going to bind you,\" her mother announcedwithdetermination.</p><p>Avelyn's eyeswidened uncertainly. \"Bind me?'' \"Aye. Ifwe cannot change the gown to fityour shape, we shallchange your shapetofitthe gown. \"</p><p>\"Oh, dear,\"Avelyn breathed, notat all sure that this sounded agoodidea.</p><p>Several moments latershe was quitesure it was not. She foundherselfclutching desperatelyat Runilda to helpkeep herself inplace as her mother and Gunnora worked behindher, busily tugging and squeezing.</p><p>\"How much more, Mother? Tis awfullytight already,\" Avelyngasped, her hands clutching Runilda'sshoulders. The maidgaveher a half-worried, half-bracingsmile, thenleaned to the side to try to seewhat Lady Straughtonand Gunnorawere doing behind Avelyn's back. Avelyn did not need to see. She could feel it. They had wrapped the linentight around her waist and were drawing it tighter with each pass... andtighter... and tighter.</p><p>\"I know 'tis uncomfortable, but 'tis onlyfor alittle while,\" her mother soothed, thenordered,\"Tighter, Gunnora. We arealmost there. \"</p><p>Avelyn groaned asthe restriction aroundher waist becameunbearable. She could swear her vitalswere being pushed upward in search of room as the cloth was bound abouther. Unfortunately,those vitalsappeared to betaking up room generally usedbyherlungs. Her breath was suddenly terribly restricted. Avelyn nearly fainted withrelief when her mother announced, \"There! That is it! Nowlet usjust tie it off. \"</p><p>\"Wecannot tie it,m'lady,\" Gunnora protested. \" 'Twillleave a bulge. \"</p><p>\"Oh,aye. We shall have to sew it, I suppose. \" She sighed. \"Well,here. I shall hold it while yousew,but be quick about itplease, Gunnora. Myhands are already threatening to cramp. I do not know how long I can continue to hold it. \"</p><p>\"Aye, m'lady. \"</p><p>Avelyn listened to allthis through a growing fog. She trulycouldnot take in more thana slight puff of air at atime. Groaning as her head began to spin,she leanedher faceinto Runilda'sshoulder and tried to hold on tothethreadof consciousness for just alittle longer.</p><p>\"There!\" Gunnora's announcement drew Avelynfrom her dazed state.</p><p>\"Thank goodness!Oh, my hands,\" Lady Straughtoncomplained. \"Here, letus do upthe gown. Perfect. \"</p><p>Avelyn presumed the \"perfect\"meant that theyhad managed to fastenthegowri.</p><p>She wasn't sure,however, until she felt herself being turnedaway from where she leaned againstRunilda. Liftingher head, she tried for a smile as she found herself facing her mother and Gunnora.</p><p>\"Oh,\" Lady Straughton breathed.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Gunnora agreed. Thetwo women exchanged congratulatory glances.</p><p>\"You look lovely, my dear. Justlovely. \"Taking Avelyn's arm, Lady Straughton urged her towardthe door. \"Now letus go belowbefore they come looking for us. \"</p><p>Avelyn managed to cross almost half the room, each step slower and more arduousthan the onepreceding it, before shewas forced to stop and catch her breath.</p><p>\"What is it, dear?\" Lady Straughtonasked.</p><p>\"I... nothing,I just... need... to catch...my breath. \" Avelynforced a smile even as she strained to drawair intohercompressedlungs. \"Just__give me... amoment. \"</p><p>Lady Straughtonexchanged ananxious glancewithher maid, then murmured, \"Aye. Takea momentto catch yourbreath. Then we may go below and introduce you to yourbetrothedere we walktothe church. \"</p><p>Thesmallpuff of air Avelyn had managed to draw intoher chest wheezedout at the verythought of walking - not just out of the room anddownthestairs but all the way to the chapel. The church had never seemed very far away toher before,but at that moment itmight as well have been miles away. She could not seem to get enough air into her lungs to breathe, let alone walk. Avelynwas faint and swayingon her feetaftercrossing only her room; shewould never make it all theway to the church.</p><p>\"Ido not think I can manage to walk that far,\" she admitted, feeling as though she wereletting everyone down.</p><p>\"Oh, dear. \"Lady Straughton steadied her as Avelyn swayed against her. \"You are flushing, then paling, dear. Mayhap we should loosen thebindingjust atouch. \"</p><p>\"We can not,\"Gunnora said. \"We sewed it in place. \"</p><p>Lady Straughtonlooked so distressed at this reminderthat Avelyn forced herself upright and suggested, \"Perhaps if we move slowly. \"</p><p>\"Aye. \" Her mother agreedwithrelief. \" 'Tis more ladylike towalkslowly anyway.</p><p>Come, let us tryagain,but slowly this time. \"</p><p>Avelyn took one struggling step, then another. She could feel her face flushing withthe effort, then feel theheat seepingaway fromher skin, leaving hercheeks pale andcold as the room begantospinaround her.</p><p>\"Oh, dear. This is not goingto work,\" Lady Straughton saidunhappily,drawing Avelynto a halt. She hesitated for a moment, obviously thinking,then suddenly turned to her maid with determination. \"Fetch Warinand my husbandhere at once, Gunnora. \"</p><p>\"Aye, my lady. \"</p><p>Margeria Straughton turned her attention back to Avelyn as the maid hurried from the room. Notingthe way Avelynwas swaying on her feet, shefrownedand pushed herseveralstepstothe side until shestoodin front ofa chest. \"Here, dear; sit here. \"</p><p>\"I cannot,\" Avelyn wheezed, strugglingto retain her feet despite her mother's pushing. \"I cannot sit! That will make it worse. Please! I need air. Ineed - \"</p><p>Lady Straughton's eyes widened in horror. \"You are turning blue! Runilda! Quickly, the window!\" she cried,and pulling Avelyn's arm over her shoulder, she draggedher acrossthe room in a panic as the maid ran ahead and opened the shutters.</p><p>It was a gusty day. The windwhirled intothe room, sending the drapes around herbed rippling as Avelynleanedagainstthe ledge. She couldfeel the breeze clawing ather hair, pulling several strandsloose from the tight chignonshe'd had Runilda arrange, but she didn't care. All she cared about was the revivingsensation of the coolbreeze slappingher face. Avelynopened hermouth tothe wind and gasped, tryingto suck air intolungs that simply had no room to accept more than a bit at a time.</p><p>\"What the devil is goingonhere?\"</p><p>All threewomen stiffened at that roarasthe door burstopen. Avelyn glanced over her shoulder asherfather stomped in with aconcerned Warin on his heels.</p><p>\"Margeria? What is the delay? First Avelyn does not come down; then you disappear and Gunnora - \"He paused abruptly as he glimpsed Avelyn's pallid face.</p><p>Thefire fled his expression, replacedby concern ashe rushed forward. \"Avelyn? DearGod,you arepale asdeath. What isthe matter?\"</p><p>\"'Tis all right, 'tis - \" Lady Straughtonbegan, but pausedwhen Avelyn's fingers tightenedconvulsively on her arm.</p><p>\" Tis just nerves,Father,\" Avelyn finished for her on a gasp, thenpaused tosuck inanother bit of breath. Tears immediately welled in her eyes,asmuch from the tortureof her lungs as from her words asshefinished, \"I am gettingmarriedand leavingmyhome. I willmiss youandI - \"</p><p>Herwords endedon a painedgroan as Willham Straughton hugged her tight.</p><p>\"And we shall missyou too. You area spark of light in ourlives,child. But we shall visit often and - Have youlostsome meat, girl? You seem smaller to hug. \"</p><p>Avelyn's answer was a gurgling gasp as she clutched her father's tunic and struggled to get herface out ofhisshoulder to breathe insomemuch-neededair.</p><p>She wasn'table to gether noseor mouth free, butshedid gether eyes above his shoulder. They were wide and alarmedas they fellonhermother.</p><p>\"Let her go, Willham!\" Lady Straughtoncried. \"Youare suffocating her. \"</p><p>Avelyn found herself released atonce. She turned away to fall againstthewindow ledge, gasping at theair smacking her inthe face.</p><p>\"Are yousure 'tis just nerves?\" Warm asked. \"She doesnot appearto be at all well. \"</p><p>\"Aye. 'Tis nerves,\" Lady Straughton insisted. Then Avelyn heard the definite sound of her mother sucking in a determined breath. It sounded a lovely deep, bracing breath, and Avelyn moaned as she imagined being able to suck in one herself. Thenshe heard her mother say, \"Howbeit, inthis state, the walk to the church would be toomuch for her. Willham, you shall have to take everyone down tothe church.

She hadonly taken afew stepsere the room began to sway around her. Avelyn suspected it waswasting breath on speech that had brought the faintness on so quickly this time. It seemed she would haveto choose between speaking and walking. At the moment, walking was the more important task, so she merelypaused for a moment to allow the sensation topass, thencontinued on. Avelyn was not the only one to breathe a sigh of relief when she reached the door.</p><p>She pausedtolean against the door frame for amoment, thenmanageda smile at the anxious women andpulled the door open. She steppedoutintothe halland paused.</p><p>All Avelynneed do was manage the long, long hallway and then the stairs.</p><p>Tighteningher lips against the whimperthat wanted toslip outatthe thoughtof all those stairs,she straightened her shoulders andstarted forth, terriblyrelievedwhen her mother took onearm and Gunnora the other. Runildathen dropped behindto press her hands to Avelyn'sback. Thethree of them were nearly carrying her,and still Avelyn had to pause often to attempt to drawbreath and allow her head to clear.</p><p>She'd just paused again to suck greedily at the air around her when Warin appeared on thelanding.</p><p>\"Whatever is taking so long? I have been waitingfor - \"Her brother paused in front of them,his gaze turning concerned. \"This is no merenerves. DearLord,Avy is aboutto swoon. \"Hisgazeturned from womanto woman, demanding answers Avelyn couldhave lived the rest of her life not giving.</p><p>Deciding it was bestto makethe humiliating explanations herself, Avelyn did so as quicklyandplainly asshe could,tryingnot to cringe and flush or stammer. Then she awaited his response. Much to her relief,Warin merelygrunted, then said,\"Well, 'tisobvious you need helpgetting tothe horse,elsewe will never make it to the church. \"</p><p>He stepped forward and tried to sweep Avelyn into his arms. Tried and failed.</p> <p>With thetight binding, she was as stiff asa broomstick from thehips up. Avelyn simply did notbend. There was no way anyone could sweep her anywhere. For a moment, she fearedshe'd have totravelthe stairs after all; then her brother half squatted in front of her. He wrapped his arms around her upper legs, then straightened with a grunt.</p><p>Avelyn let out whatshould have beena squeal, but was more of asqueak,and clutchedat hisheadandshoulders. \"What - ?\"</p><p>\"Be still, Avelyn,\" Warin saidgruffly. \"This shall be tricky and no doubtingit. \"</p><p>Avelyn remainedstill. Had she not been so starved for air, she was sure she wouldhaveheld her breath. Asit was, she prayed all the waydown the stairsand could have wept withrelief when theyreachedthegreat-hall floor. Warin carriedher out of the castle,with their motherand the two maids following, thenhesitatedon reaching his mount. Heturnedwithherstill in his arms andasked, \"HowamIto get heronthe horse? One must bendtosit a horse. \"</p><p>There was a moment of stunned silence;then Lady Straughton stepped forward.</p><p>\"Set her down, Warin,and give meyour knife. Then you shall need toturn your back fora moment. \"</p><p>\"What - ?\" Avelyn began anxiously as Warin set her down.</p><p>\"Turnaround,dear,\"her mother ordered, then set to workon the lacingat the back of the gown. \"We are goingtoslit the lower part of the binding justenoughthat you may sit the horse. \"</p><p>\"But - \" Avelyn's protest died inher throat as she felt the lower part of the bindinggive way somewhat. It wasjustthesmallest bit and was at the lowerpart of thebinding, around the bottom of herhips, sothe changebrought no relief toher abused lungs, but still it was ablissfulsensation. God, how wonderfulitwould be whenthe binding was finally removed, she thoughtdreamily.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Dear God, thebindingwas bursting! Avelyn wasn'treally aware of that fact at first. She noticed that some of her discomfortseemed to ease when they wereonly halfway to the chapel. They would havebeen all the way tothechapel and halfway through the ceremonyat thatpoint, but her motherhad come upwith the brilliantidea thatshe, Gunnora and Runilda should walkin front of the horse, each carrying a basket of flowers which they would strew before Warin's mount as they led the way to the chapel. She had thought it a most romantic idea and had wasted several momentsraidingher garden of thefinest buds.</p><p>Avelyn hadthought it rather sweet atthetime. But now, as herdiscomfort eased anotherlittle bit,andshe realizedthat the split her mother had sliced into the bottom of her binding was splitting furtherof its own accord, she decided it had been quite the worst idea ever.</p><p>\"Whatever is the matter? You have gone quite stiff,\" Warin said as Avelyn straightened before him. Not that she hadn't already been sittingstraightin the saddle as they crossed thebaileytothe chapel, but Avelyn was now stretchingher back out as much asshe could. And her breathing, which had been shallow panting really,had now stopped altogetheras she tried desperatelyto make herself as small as possible andpreventthe rend from tearingfurther.</p><p>\"Avy?\"</p><p>\"Hurry,\" shegasped.</p><p>\"Hurry? But - \" He glanced toward their mother and the two maids,whowere walking before them,thenback again, and she saw his concerndeepen. \"Whatever is the matter with your face, Avy? Tis allred and puffy. \"</p><p>Avelyn released the breath she'd been holdingand hissed, \"Never mind my face.</p><p>The binding is giving, Warin. I need to dismount. Now. \"</p><p>Much to herrelief, he didnot hesitate further, but calledhismother to themand explainedtheproblemand that they must speed upthisprocession. Nodding, Lady Straughtonhurried back tothe maids and heldawhisperedconference. Then the women set out again, this time at an accelerated pace. In fact, they wentfrom aslow meander to an almostjog, rushing along, strewing flowers at a slightly frantic speed as Warin urged hismounttofollowontheir heels.</p><p>Theyhad gone perhapsanother ten feet when Avelyn becameaware of a definite easingof the binding. This timeshecould hear theclothtearingbeneathher dress.</p><p>Warin heardit too.</p><p>\"Faster,\" he called softly to thewomen. Then as the rending sound cameagain, he simplyhissed, \"Move!\"</p><p>Lady Straughtonglanced around with dismay, then hurried out of the way asher son urged his horse into a trot. The three women scampered after them, tossing flowersat their backsas they raced forward. Avelyn couldnot sayforsure which of them was the most relieved when Warin finally drew his mount to a halt. Shewasn't surprised to find that every last weddingguest gatheredinfront of the chapel was agapeat this display.</p><p>Warin slid off his mount and turnedto findAvelyn following ina flurryof skirts, alightingwith indecent hastein an effort to prevent the rendin herbindings from going further.</p><p>She stood very still then, hardly breathing as she waited to seeifall would be well or whethershe would burstout of the gown like a grapeescaping itsskin.</p><p>\"Isit all right?\" Warin asked anxiously.</p><p>\"Aye. I thinkso,\" Avelyn murmured. Certainly, the bindingwas firmly enough in placethatshe stilldidn't seem able to breathemuch.</p><p>\"Is all well?\" her mother askedbreathlessly as she caught up to diem. Gunnora andRunilda, also out ofbreath fromtheir run, were on her heels.</p><p>\"Aye. Ido not think it went very far. How do I look?\"</p><p>Her mother looked her over critically, then reached upto pinchher cheeks. \"You are abitpale,but otherwise lovely. \"</p><p>Avelyn stood stillas her mother triedto bring some colorback intoher skin. The attention to her cheeks, however, reminded her of one of the insults Hugo had tormentedherwithsome years back. He'd said shehadchubby cheeks like asquirrel with nutsinitsmouth andhad followedher around for a whole week screaming, \"Chubby cheeks! Chubby squirrelcheeks!\"Now,Avelyn imaginedherselflooking utterly ridiculous with her forced trim body and bloated chubby cheeks.</p><p>\"There. \" Her mother stepped backandoffered abracingsmile. \"You look lovely.</p><p>Can youwalk the rest of the way?\"</p><p>Avelyn cast a quick nervous glance over her shoulder at the distance to the churchsteps. Warin had stopped sooner than shewouldhaveliked, butshe thought she could manage the distance if shewentvery slowly.</p><p>\"Aye. \" Avelyn sucked inher cheeks, trying for a less squirrel-like look as she turnedtofacethe church.</p><p>The guests parted like the Red Seafor Moses, leavingapathfor her towalk.</p><p>Avelyn started slowlyforward. Veryslowly. So slowlyshe was hardly moving,and still shewas panting and fighting a woozy feeling afteronly a handful of steps.</p><p>\"Dear God, she looks like afish!\" Wimarc Gervillegasped in shock, then grunted when hiswife's elbow found its way into his gullet. \"Sorry...but she does,\" he muttered withchagrin, then shook his head. \"Wife, I donot recall her cheeks being all puckered and her lips all pursed like that when we saw her asa childand agreed tothe contract. Do you?\"</p><p>\"Nay. \"Lady ChristinaGerville focused onthe girl walking toward them. Dear God in heaven, the chit was movingsoslowly and laboriously,one mighthavebeen forgiven for thinkingshe waswalking to her deathratherthan to her betrothed. Lady Gerville's gazenarrowed on Avelyn'spuckered face, and then she relaxed somewhat.</p><p>\"I believe she may besucking inhercheeks. \"</p><p>\"Whatever for?\"Paen finally joinedthe conversation ashe watched his bride draw near. Ifhis mother answered his question, Paen was too distracted by his concern over hisbride to hear herresponse. It was nother looksthat worriedhim. True,her lower face wasrather squinchedupat the moment, making her look abitfishlike, but evensohe could see that her lips weresoftand full. Shealso had a straight nose, and large, clear blue eyes. And her hair was alovely chestnutbrown,scoopedup withlittle tendrils left to soften her face. Hesuspectedthatif she released her cheeks, she would bemore than passably pretty.</p><p>Nay, it was not herlooks thatconcernedPaen at the moment,it was the way she walked. She was as stiff asa soldierwith broken ribsand movingatanextremely slow pacethat he would expect only from someoneweak or ailing. The very last thingPaenwishedfor was a weak or ailing bride. He'd beenrather hoping for a robust, healthy wifewhowould offer comfort and strengththrough the trials life would no doubthave in store for them.</p><p>There was little Paen could do about the matternow, however. Ifshe wasweak or ailing,he would find out soon enough and have tomake do. This betrothal contract had been drawn up in his name when he was just a child, and his honorallowedno choice but to standbyit.</p><p>It took a nudge from his father to make Paen realize that his betrothed had reachedhis side andthat - rather thanturnto facethe priest - he was still standing withhis back to the man as he surveyed her with displeasure.</p><p>Rocking under his father's not so subtle reminder, he grunted a greetingand offered asmile to the girl.</p><p>Avelyn closed her eyes, then blinked them openagainand sent up asilentprayer of thanks to God when Paen de Gerville smiled at her. For one heart-stopping momentshe hadfeared that the horrible binding and the cheek-sucking she was doinghad all beenfornaught. She'dbeen sure that he would do as Eunice andher brothers had suggested and reject her outright.</p><p>Legsweak and trembling,fear seeming almost toeataway her strength, Avelyn didn't turn to thepriest atonce, but insteadstared up atherbetrothed.</p><p>Her motherhad not beenlying when she said hewas handsome and strong. The man was both. Hislookswere not the first thing she noticed,however. It was the sheersize of him. He was extremely tall, with shoulders almost aswide as the chapel door behind him. And yes,hewashandsome. But, more important to her, he was obviously kind, for though his initial expressionhad given him awayand shown his disappointment with her as his bride, thesmile that he was now gracing herwith assured her that hewould notrefuse this marriage. Aye. He wasincredibly kind, she decided, and fella littlebitin love with him on the spot for not turning her away.</p><p>Athroat-clearingby the priestbroughtAvelyn backto the situation at hand. She turnedtofacethe holyman. His expressionmade her realize thatwhileshe hadbeen busy ogling her betrothed, he had commenced with the wedding and was now awaiting some response from her.</p><p>\"I thoo?\" sheoffered, flushing atthewayher words were mangled byher effort tokeephercheekssucked in. She had to holdthem in place by gentlybiting on them withherteeth. No one commented, however, and Avelynforced herself to relaxand breathein some much-needed air. Only thereseemed very little airabout for herto breathe. The crowd ofpeople pressing inonthem appeared to be hogging it greedily for themselves. Trying a little harder to drag air into her lungs, Avelyn grabbed unconsciously ather betrothed'sarm and told herself notto panic, but the priest's facewas wavering before her, his voicegrowing louder,then fading inher ears. Oh, no, she thoughtunhappily, this isn't good at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paen's concern over the state of his bride's health grew as the ceremony proceeded. She had grasped hisarm moments ago. This was notso unusualin itself, butthe desperate, clawlike nature of thegrasp was. Now, as the long ceremony continued, he became certain that she was starting to sway on her feet ever so slightly. Then whenit cametime for her to repeat her vows, her voicewasbreathy andfaint.</p><p>Paen watched herwith concern,sodistracted thathe wasn'tat first surewhy his father had nudged him when he rocked under his elbow.</p><p>\"Youmay kiss the bride. \" The way the priest saidthe words suggested that it wasn'tthe first time he had done so.</p> <p>Paenturned tofully face his bride, frowningatthe way she was breathing. She was taking quick shallow breaths, almostpanting. She was also lookingterribly faint.</p><p>Suspectingthat this mightbea short marriage thanks to her obvious illhealth, Paen bent to presshislips to hers. She tasted of honey mead. Her lipswere softand warm and... gone?</p><p>Paen opened his eyes with amazement as the crowd around him let out a collective gasp. He wasjust in time to catch hisbride's fallingform. She had fainted.</p><p>Paengapedathisunconscious bride, part of his mind inshock, theother part noting that she was indeed passably pretty. More than passably pretty now that unconsciousnesshadstopped her from sucking in her cheeks. Infact, other thanher unusual pallor, she was lovely.</p><p>\"What's the matterwiththe girl?\"</p> <p>It was Paen's father who askedthat question. His words acted as something of a spell-breaker for everyoneelse. The mobbroke out inimmediate chatter even as Avelyn's family rushed forward to surround Paen wherehe stood holding heragainst his chest.</p><p>\"What is going on? Is she all right?\" Lord Straughton bellowed, sounding alarmed. Paen had to takethat as a good sign. Itseemedto suggest that thegirl wasn't taken to fainting and that this mightbe an unusual occurrence. That was encouraging.</p><p>\"She is fine,\" Lady Straughton assured everyone even as she and two maids crowded forward to fan Avelyn'sface.</p><p>\"Here, perhapsIshould - \" Warin Straughton, the brother, tried towrest thegirl from Paen's grasp, and that was when Paen'sown shock passed.</p><p>Scowling at the manfor trying to do what it was now his duty to do, Paen elbowed him aside and swept Avelyn up into his arms... Sort of. His new bride wasn'tvery sweepable. Infact, from hips to neck she was alarmingly unbending. She ended lyingflat across his arms like aboard,with herhead andknees hanging off like trailingivy. it was mostdisconcerting.</p><p>Grunting, Paen moved forward, quickly losing the fanningwomen as he forced his way through the chattering crowd.</p> <p>His gaze dropped several timesto hisbride'sface as he crossed the baileyto the keep. The factthatshe wasprettyshould have cheered him. After all, no man wished tobed a fish-faced wench, buteven her fairness was notenough in hismind tomake up for herobviously weak constitution. In truth, he would rather have a healthy homely wife than aprettybut ill one.</p><p>Paen'syears oncampaign had filled himwith certainhopes whenit cameto a wife. He had spentmany - too many - yearsfightingbattle after battle, living inmean tentsthatleakedwhenit rainedanddid nothing to keep out the night chill.</p><p>Atfirst, it had been a grand adventure. He'd enjoyed the camaraderie of his compatriots. Butas battle hadfollowedbattle,and manafterman hadfallen at his side, leaving himknee deepinblood and death, the grand adventure hadbegunto pall. Paen hadfound himself yearning for the comfort ofa dry bed, a warm hearth and the softbreast of agood wifeto lay his weary head on. Only his fealtyto his king, and his desireto protectand watch over his younger brotherAdam, whohad followed himto battle andwasslowerto lose his enthusiasmfor it, hadkept Paen fromleavingthe war trail and returning home. But when Adam died, a Saracen sword through the chest, Paen lost his heart for battle. Seeming to recognizethis, KingRichardhadgivenhimleave to take newsof his brother's death home, andhad suggested that Paen might wish to tendto his weddingnow. Paen had returned at once withthe sad tidings. Afterallowinga shorttime for thegriefto pass,hehad thensent news that hewished to claim his betrothed.</p><p>All the while he had been hoping, expecting even, that his bride would be comfortingly plump and strong. Awomanhe would not crushwhen he beddedher andwhose full, softbreasts could bea cushionfor his head on cold winter nights.</p><p>\"Ohh. \"</p><p>Paen left off his thoughts at that moan. His bride was coming around. He suspected it was the fresh breeze slapping her cheeks thatrevived her. When she liftedher headand peered at him weakly,hetriedto adjust her to a more upright position in his arms, butshe stilldid not bend.</p><p>He didn't get to ponder that fact andwhat itmight meanfor long because she began to strugglein his arms. \"Well, that was akind description. Stiff asher middle was, what she wasdoingwas more like flopping her headand lowerlegs across his upraisedarms.</p><p>\"Pray! Let me stand!\" She was both out of breath and seemingly terribly embarrassed by the whole ordeal.</p> <p>Trying to soothe her, Paenoffered areassuringsmile and said, \"Rest. \"</p><p>Avelyn stopped her struggles and lay stillwhen her newhusband grunted that word. She couldn't tell ifhe was angry or not. He didn't sound angry, but his expression was a grimace. She supposed hewas somewhatput outby herfainting.</p><p>She hadn't made a very good showof it at thewedding, what with her lispingand fainting and all.</p><p>Recalling her lisp when she had said her \"I do's\" made Avelynrealize that she was no longer suckingin hercheeks. Shequicklydid so now, hopinghehadn'tnoticed her chubby face. She then peered pasthisshoulder to seethat theentirewedding partywas following themsome distance back. He was walkingvery quickly despite the burdenof carrying her, andleft the others furtherbehind with each step. She sighed unhappily. Thiswas all terribly embarrassing. It also could not be good for herhusbandtocarry her so far. Warin had carried her down thestairs, butreally this was a good distance further than that.</p><p>\"Pray, my lord,\" she tried again, releasingher cheeksbriefly tospeak. \"Put me down ereyoudoyourselfan injury. I am too heavy for you to - \" She paused uncertainly. Her new husband had stopped walking andwas now staring at her in amazement. Even as she notedhis surprise, he suddenly burstout laughing.</p><p>Aftera moment, he shookhis head and said, \"I shall hardly injuremyself carrying a littlething like you. Women!\" He saidthe last in atone ofexasperated bemusement andcontinued to walk again, seeminglyoblivious to the fact that Avelynhad flushed an even deepershadeof pink. Shewas hardly a \"little thing\" but gave up her protests andsuffered the rest of the journey in silence.</p><p>It was a great relief toher when they finally reached the keep and entered. It was evenmoreof arelief to be set on the trestle-table bench. Avelynbusily straightened her skirts andavoided meetingthe gaze ofthe man now positioning himself on the bench beside her. She was sonervous that it wasalmost a relief when the keep doors opened and peoplebegan bustlinginto thegreat hall.</p><p>Lady Straughtonwas at the head of the crowd rushing to fill the room. She moved quickly to Ave-lyn's side,her expression concerned. \"Are you well, dear? Have yourecovered?\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Avelyn answered.</p><p>\"You look much better,\" a womanshe could only assume was Paen's mother commented, coming to a halt beside Lady Margeria.</p><p>\"Aye. Youdo. \" Lord Straughton paused at her side and patted her shoulder awkwardly. Then he shook his head and told aman who looked very much like an olderversionof Paen, \"Thisis most distressing. Avelyn has neverfainted aday in herlife. Itmust beall theexcitement. \"</p><p>Avelyn closed her eyes, wishing everyone would just sit down andletthe matter go. It was allterribly embarrassing.</p><p>\"Iam sure it is just theexcitement,\" someone said, and Avelyn opened her eyesto peer at the speaker. The woman wasabout her mother'sage, withgrayingpaleblond hairanda pretty face.</p><p>\"Aunt Helen is right,\" a petiteblond girl agreed. \"My cousinwas like that as well.</p><p>She was ever the most stalwartof women. She never fainted a day in her life__until she got with child. Thenshe would faint atthe dropof a feather. \"</p><p>\"Diamanda!\" the olderblonde, Aunt Helen, gaspedwithshock.</p><p>\"Idid not mean that Lady Avelyn is - Of course she could not be with child,\" the girl said quickly. Shewas flushed and looked horrifiedthat her words had been taken so. \"I just meant'twasthestrain of child-bearingthat - And 'tis most like the strain of the wedding and everything...\" Her voice faded away as she peered helplessly aroundat the horrifiedgazes of those around her. Diamanda's expression suggested she might like nothing betterthantosimply disappear on the spot.</p><p>Knowing that feeling well, Avelynfelt pity stir in her for the girl. She knew how uncomfortable it was to bethe cynosureof all eyes. She detested it herself,and it was even worse whenyou were at the center of attentionbecause ofsomething silly you saidor did. Forcinga smile, she braved that verything to aid the unfortunate girl.</p><p>\"Of course you did not,\" she said gently. \"This is allvery silly, really. Ihavebeen working hard tohelp arrange everything. Then, too, I wasnervous and haven'tbeen sleepingwell. And it was quite stuffytherein front of the church witheveryone crowded around, was it not?\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" her mother agreedquickly,tryingto help her diffusethesituation. \"Come, we should sit.</p><p>Cookhas been working for days on this feast and planningit for even longer. She is most likely eager to start serving it. \"</p><p>Much to Avelyn's relief,everyone began to settleatthe table. She let out a little breathof reliefat thatand glancedshyly to the side, onlyto drop her eyes at once whenshe sawhernew husband peering ather.</p><p>\"Thank you. \"</p><p>She glanced backto him with surpriseat those softly spoken words. \"For what, mylord?\"</p><p>\"For not getting offendedby Diamanda's unfortunate choice of words, and for helping to defusethe matter. \"</p><p>Flushing, Avelyn gave a small shrugandbegan to absently smooth the white cloth hermother had insisted be laidover the head table. \"I amsureshe meant no insult. \"</p><p>\"She's a childstill and awkward attimes,\" hesaid, then added with a wry twistto hislips, \"and, I fear, a bit spoiled. Mother always regretted not having a daughter andshowered Diamanda with affection when she arrived totrain at Gerville. Mother will be sorry to see her go. \"</p><p>\"Ishertraining done, then?\" Avelyn asked.</p><p>Paen shrugged. \"She trainedat Gerville because she wasto marry my brother Adam. Nowthathe is dead, her fatheris looking foran alternatehusbandfor the girl.</p><p>He haddecided she should return home while theymake the search, and her Aunt Helen came to collect her, but motheris tryingtoconvincehimtoallowDiamandato stayuntil shehas tomarry. A note has been sent toher father, and Helenis staying on until we get a response. \" Hisgaze slid along the table to the girl. \"I fear Mother will be disappointed. \"</p><p>\"You do notthink her fatherwill letherstay?\" Avelyn asked with surprise, and he shook his head.</p><p>\"She is aprettychild. I suspect her father may already have made a matchforher andwill want her hometoprepare formarriage. \"</p><p>\"She lookstobe at least sixteen,mylord. Hardly achild. \"</p><p>\"She is fourteen,\" hecorrected.</p><p>Surprised, Avelynglancedalong thetable tothe girlin question. Diamanda did havea young face,clear skin, pixie features. Avelyn supposed shehad been misled by the child's figure. While she was small in thewaist and in height, shewas also extremely welldeveloped in the bustarea. Still, at fourteen she was oldenough for marriage andnot considereda child. Avelyn thought no moreof thematter as the door to the kitchens opened andservants began to file in carrying platters of food.</p><p>The firstof the servers moved to the headtable, while the others spread themselves among the lower tables. The foodsmelled delicious, and Avelyn smiled at thegirl who stopped before herand Paen toserve them. Paen began topile foodonto the trencher they shared,leavingAvelyn to concentrateonhermisery.</p><p>She wasstill finding itdifficult to breathe. It wasbad enough when she stood, but whilst sitting she felt as if there werea great band around her ribs, crushing them.</p><p>Which,of course, there was. Avelyn could not even imagine beingable to swallow anyof the foodPaen was piling onto the trencher. If there wasn't room tosuck in something as ephemeral as air, therecertainly wasn't roomforfood... which seemed likesome form of torture to Avelyn, forshewasquitehungry. Shehad been too nervous to eat the day beforeas they'd awaitedthe arrival ofher betrothedand his family. In fact, Avelyn recalled now,she'd been rather nervous the night ere that too and hadmerelypicked at her food, soit wasnearly two days now since shehad actually eaten. And here wasshe, alltrussed up like a turkey and unable to eat.</p><p>To make matters worse, she was also hot and sweaty, and becoming uncomfortablyitchy where the binding stopped below her breasts. Thetop of the cloth seemed to bechafing the undersides ofher breasts, irritating the tenderflesh there mightily. Avelyntriedstretchingouther backbonein an effort to find some relief and perhaps a bit of air, butthe effort appeared to do little good.</p><p>\"Eat. \"</p><p>\"Hmmm?\" Avelynglanced distractedly at the man beside her. Hehad apparently finishedpiling theirtrencher and hadalready dug in. Paen gesturedto the mealand repeated, \"Eat. \"</p><p>WhenAvelyn peeredatthe foodwith secret longing, but did not move to take any,he sighed and said, \"I had hoped for a healthy wife,witha healthy appetite. \"</p><p>The disappointment inhis voice was enoughto make Avelynpick up a drumstick fromthe selection on thetrencherand lift it to her mouth. She didn't bite of it, however, but merely held it under her nose andbefore her lips andbreathed in. The succulent scent of the roasted meat nearlyhad her swooning with pleasure and longing, but she knewpositively thatthere was no way the food would fit intoher presently constricted stomach. It would mostlikelylodge itselfsomewhere between herbreasts and add to her discomfort. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\" Tis good, is it not?\" her new husband commented, apparently searching for conversation.</p><p>Avelyn nodded at once, andtook abite since he was watchingher expectantly.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didnot turn hisattention back tothetrencher asshe'd hoped, but continued towatch her,and Avelyn was forced to chew... and chew. DearGod, it tasted like mannafrom thegods. Still, she feared she'd choke on it if sheswallowed, soshe chewed the meat into mash in her mouthas he watched, then chewed some more.</p> <p>\"Ithink you have chewed enough,\" he commented at last with amusement.</p><p>With little else to do, Avelyn swallowed the bite ofmeat. Much to her relief, the food did not lodgein herthroat as she had feared,but foundroom in her squeezed stomach. Avelynwas just breathing a sigh of relief when she heard and felt the binding give way a bit. Alarmfilledher atonceand shestiffenedwhereshe sat, straightening even further to trytopreventmore tearing of the cloth, but it was tono avail. The rending soundcameagain.</p><p>\"Did you hear something?\" Paenasked.</p><p>\"No,\" Avelyn squeaked, the bite of chicken churning inhertight belly.</p><p>\"No? Hmm. \" He glancedaround. \"I am sureIheard something, though I am not surewhatit wasor where itcamefrom. \"</p> <p>Afraid to move oreven breathe, Avelyn dropped her arms topress her elbows againsthersides in a vain effort to hold herself in.</p><p>\"There it isagain!\" Paen glancedaround sharply, first looking at her, then pasther in an effort to find the source of the sound. Avelyn didnot look around. Sheknew the source. She could feel herlungs expand a bit with each rending sound, and where secondsago she had beenafraid to move and possiblymake the situation worse, she was nowalmostdesperate toleavethe tableere she learnedwhat true humiliation was. For onemoment she desperatelysearched her mind foranexcuse to leave, but as the rendingcame again,shegave up botheringwith an excuseand lunged to her feet.</p><p>Her timing wasbad. A servant hadjust stopped behind herand Paen, bearing a tray holding ahuge hamhock. Avelynmanaged to jostle the unsuspectingman as she stood, sending thehamhock sliding off the tray as ittipped inhis hands. Acting oninstinct, Avelynbent to catch the large hunkof meat. It wasa badinstinct. There was no mistaking theloud rending sound as shedid so. She stilled atonce, handson the ham hock that lay in therushes.</p><p>\"Avelyn?\" hermotherasked uncertainly. Avelynclosed her eyes andbeganto pray. So far it was just herbinding that was gone. The gown she worewasholding her in, but she knew its seamswould not last long. Please, God, let me make it above stairs, she prayed,thenstraightened.</p><p>God appeared to be engaged elsewhere. Avelyn had barely straightened completely when the seamsof her gown begantosplit. She instinctivelyclutched the hamhock against her chest, trying to hide behind it ashergown burst like the skin of an overripe grape. The ham hock wasn't big enough to hide her. That was obvious from Paen's expression ashe gapedat her.</p><p>\"Avelyn!\"hermother gasped with dismay in the sudden silence as all eyesturned toher.</p> <p>Tearsof humiliation wellingin her eyes,Avelyn bit herlipand shook her head as hermother rose to movetoherside.</p><p>\"I am sorry, mylord,\" Avelyn managed tosay withouther voice cracking. \"I wishedto looknice and... my gown would not fitand... Mother and Gunnora bound meup, but the binding has splitand - \"Her voice died abruptlyas Eunice let loose ashriek of laughter. She was quickly joined by both Hugo andStacius. The three were nearly falling off the bench with theiramusement. No one else joined in the laughter, thoughagiggledid escape Diamanda before her aunt shushed her.</p><p>Otherwise,the guests and the people of Straughton were all eyeing Avelynwith sympathy and pity, butthatmerely completed her humiliation.</p><p>Mortified, shedropped the ham hock and turnedto flee thegreat hall,racingup the stairs to her room as quickly as her legs wouldcarry her. Now that she could breathe again, that was ratherfast.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Paen stared after his bride inamazement as she fled up thestairs. Shemoved rather quickly for one who had fainted during the wedding ceremony. He was marveling overthiswhen her motherrecovered fromher shockedstate and chased after her daughter. A pair of women servants followed. Lord Straughton then muttered a word to his son and alsorose. Paen noted withsome satisfactionthat the manpaused to give a dressing-down to therude triothat had laughed. Oncetheman continued onupstairs, Paen relaxedbackon the bench and peered about, rather perplexed bywhat had just happened. His bride had popped hergownbecause of some binding? Thatmade littlesense to him.</p><p>\"I do not understand, do you?\"he asked hismother at last.</p><p>\"Aye. I do. Thepoor dear. \" Lady Gervillestood and wavedher maid Sely over.</p> <p>Then the pair followed the growing parademaking their way abovestairs,leaving Paen justas bewildered. Aglance at his father's expression showedthat the older man hadno more understanding of the situation than himself. If anything,Wimarc Gerville lookedevenmoreperplexed thanPaen felt. Still, Paen asked him, \"Do you understand what just happened? Whatdid she mean about binding?\"</p><p>Lord Gerville shook his head, apparently as bewildered as his son. Paen was beginningto feel a bitfrustrated when the trio furtherdownthetable began tolaugh again. As Paenrecalled from the introductions when he had first arrived, these three were cousins tohisbride, andthe woman trying unsuccessfully to hush them was their mother andher aunt. He was about tosnap at them to shut up whenone of them, the onenamed Hugo, laughingly explained,\"The silly sow had thembindher up. Butno bindingcould hold in her belly andthe binding burst. Her poor dress followed suit. \"</p><p>\"Why ever would she dothat?\"Paen asked with true bewilderment.</p><p>\" 'Cause she isa cow and shewanted to looktrim and attractive for you,\"theone named Stacius saidas thetrio burst into freshgales of laughter.</p><p>Paen wasn't amused. Expression turning thunderous, hegot slowlyto hisfeet, his hand moving to his sword. Thatbrought thetrio toimmediate silence. Still, Paen scowledat them, debating whatto do. He supposed it wouldn't be a good ideato kill his in-lawson hiswedding day. Ontheotherhand, theyreally appeared toneed tobe taught a lesson. Their behaviorshowed a complete lack of respect for anyone, including their beleaguered-looking mother, theircousin his wife, and even for the unclewho had taken them inwhentheyhad no home. Aye, in his mind, they needed to be taughta lesson, but perhaps another day. Not killing themtoday would be a bridal gifttohis wife.</p><p>The silence inthe room seemed deafening as Paen had considered the now nervous-lookingtrio. Letting his hand drop away from his sword, Paen glanced toward thestairs, then hesitated. Aftera moment, helooked athis father,then to his newbrother-in-law. The man hadremained silent throughout, watchinghim closely.</p><p>Now Paen asked, \"Whatdo Ido? Should I go abovetoo? She ismybride. \"</p><p>Warin Straughton considered the matter, then quietly suggested, \"Best leavego for abit. Avy is terribly embarrassed. \"</p><p>\"Aye. And who would not be, with family like that?\" He looked with disgust at the cousins. \"Ishall have to let her know that Idonothold herresponsible for her cousins' oafishness. \"</p><p>Much to Paen's amazement, Warin suddenly smiled and said, \"I believeyou shall be good for her, my lord. \"</p><p>Paenstaredathim in bewilderment, thenshook his head and steppedover the bench tohead for the stairs. Despite what the brother thought, he would go to her.</p><p>She was hisbride. It was hisplace to sootheher whenshewasupset,and he was going to soothe her, dammit.</p><p>* * \"Poor darling,\" LadyStraughton cooed, rubbing Avelyn's back as she sobbed into thefresh linens on her bed.</p><p>\"Iam an idiot,\"Avelyn cried intothe linens.</p><p>\"Nay. You are brilliantandlovely, and you fared beautifully at thewedding. \"</p><p>\"Ifainted!\" Avelyn raised her head to cry, and Gunnora and Runilda arrived then, sliding silently into the room. Avelyn took one look at theirpitying expressionsand dropped her head to thebed again.</p><p>\"Aye, you did faint. \" Her mother sighed,thenstood, and there wasa rustleas she movedacross the room. \"Come, wemust getyou changedandreturntothe feast. \"</p><p>\"Changed!\"Avelyn sat upright onthe bed, horrorcoveringher face. \"I cannot return tothe feast,Mother! I humiliatedmyself!\" She groaned as sherecalled the horrible ordeal. \"Dear God, I think I shall die of embarrassment. \"</p><p>\"Nay,\" her mother assuredheras she picked up the red gownthey had discarded earlier. She began toshakeit out. \"It just feels like you shall die of embarrassment.</p><p>This is one ofthose inopportunemoments in life. There shall be many more. All you can dois hold up your head and walk with pride. \" She started backacross the room withdetermination, the two maids fallinginto step behind her, obviouslypreparedto helpforceAvelyn into the gown if necessary. Thethree ofthem stopped atthefoot of thebed and eyed her grimly. \"Now, this is your bridal feast, your celebration.</p><p>You shall have only one... God willing and yourhusbanddoesn't die. Andyou shall attend it. \"</p><p>Avelynstared at theredgown hermotherheld,considered rebelling, andthen supposed shemayas well return below. She would have toface everyone sooner or later. She supposed it was bestto do so now and getitoverwith. Heaving out a quiveringbreath, shestraightened hershouldersand slid off the bed to strip the remnantsof her ruinedgown.</p><p>It was at that moment that LordStraughton arrived and stormedinto thechamber.</p><p>\"Father!\"Avelyn squealed and crossed herarms over the thin chemise she wore as she lunged forcover behind her mother and the maids.</p><p>\"Isshe all right?\" Lord Straughton demanded.</p><p>\"Father!\" Avelyn cried again, raising her head enough to glare at him over Runilda's shoulder.</p><p>\"Do not 'Father' me! I am your father!\" Willham Straughton bellowed, then paused to frown at his ownwords. Sighing, heshook his head, then espied traces of tearsonthe portion of face he couldsee. Expression softening,he strode around the trio of women to clasp Avelyn's upperarms. Ignoring her obvious embarrassment, he said, \"You looked lovely, Avelyn. Butyou look lovelierstill now that youareno longer trussed up likea turkey. \"</p><p>\"Oh, Papa. \" Avelyn bit her lip, then fell against his chest with asniffle.</p><p>\"There, there. Tis not the end of the world,\" he soothed, patting her back awkwardly.</p><p>Avelyn nestled into his chest,feeling ascoddled andsafeas she had when just a child asshe bemoaned, \"Why could I not be more... graceful?Only Icould burst mybindingin front ofeveryonelike that. \"</p><p>\"Well,that would be my fault,\" he sighed, thumping her a littleharder in his distraction. \"Aye,you got itfrom me. \"</p><p>\"You?\" Avelyn pulled back to peer at him with surprise.</p><p>\"Mm-hmm. \"He nodded. \"See thisscar?\"</p><p>Avelyn followed his gestureto the scar besidehis right eye. Ithad beenthere as long as shecould remember. \"'Tisthe one yougot in the battle ofBelville. \"</p><p>He looked a bitchagrined. \"Aye. The battle of Belville. But I never told you exactly how I got itin the battle of Belville, did I?\"</p><p>\"Nay. \"</p><p>\"That is because'tisa tad embarrassing. Ifear it was a matter not dissimilarto your own. I'd hada pairof new braesmade. I wanted to impress your mother. The damn things were too small. They did not fit at all, but I was too proud to say so andhave the tailormakenew. I would make myselffitinto them. \" He grimaced at the memory. \"Well,I donned them and headed forQuarmby to woo yourmother. I cameacross the battle atBelville along the way. Belvillewas afriend, and I thought I would helphim out andenjoy abit of sporton my way, so I stopped and joined in thebattle. it was neartheend of the battle when the seams on my braesburst. \" He shudderedat the memory. \"Iinstinctively reached to cover mybollocks,and Lord Ivers got in a lucky blow. \"</p><p>He rubbed at the scar on his face withremembered disgust. \"Twas damned embarrassing, I'll tell you. And that bloody Iverstalkedabout itfor the next six months. He laughed his arseoff in the tellingevery time too. The manrubbedmy facein itat every turn until Ifinally killed him in the battle ofIpswitch. \"</p><p>Avelyn winced. \"My cousins shall be laughingabout it forever. \"</p><p>\"Aye. \" Willham looked displeased atthe mention of hisnieceand nephews. \" Tis a shame we cannot killthem. \"</p><p>\"Wimarc!\" Lady Straughtonreprimanded, butwithlittle heat.</p><p>Her fathermerelyshrugged,looking unrepentant,and Avelyn bit her lip tokeep from laughing. The man wasnomore fond ofthe trio than she. He made it morethan obvious that he felt himself plaguedbytheir presencein his homeand tolerated them for his wife's sake only.</p><p>Ashuffling sound drew Avelyn's attention to thefact that Lady Gerville andher maidhad entered at some point. Avelyn's new mother-in-law now stood looking both sympathetic and uncertain of her welcome.</p><p>Managing a smile for thewoman,Avelyn stepped outof her father's embraceand reached for the gown her mother held. Paen chose thatmomentto burst into the room, and all the humiliation that her father had soothed returned in full force.</p><p>Scrambling around herfather tohide,she leanedher head against his back as he turnedtoconfront his new son-in-law.</p><p>\"Here now!What is this, my lord? You do not - \"</p><p>\"Isshe all right?\" Paen interrupted impatiently.</p><p>Avelynfelt herfather's backease at the obvious concern in theyoungerman's voice. \"Aye. She isfine.</p><p>\"Avelyn?\" Paen queried, obviously not going to bereassured until he saw for himself. Sighing,Avelyn quicklypulledher gown onover herhead,tugged it into placeandsteppedout from behind her father. Muchto her relief, Runildarushedup behindher atonce todo up the laces of her gown. Hoping herface wasn'tall red and blotchy from crying, she liftedher chin and forced herself to face him. She would have to eventuallyanyway - might as wellget it over with.</p><p>\"I am fine, mylord,\" Avelyn said withquietdignity. \"Atad embarrassed, but fine. \" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Aye.

Shewasdoing herbest not to flinch whenhe announced, \"You lookmuch better now.

She hadn't realized how ridiculous she'd appeared. And she had imaginedherself lookingbetter! Then she noticed with some uneasethat he hadbegunto frown. He was displeased with his bride after all, she thought with distress. Avelyn was allprepared for himto verbalize hisdispleasure when he stepped forward and reachedfor her hair. Within seconds he had tugged out thethong Runilda had justbegun to put in.</p><p>\"You have lovely hair. I like it better down. Youshallwear it down forme,\" he announced withanod, then snatched tip her hand and strode toward the door.</p><p>Avelyn tripped after him, beaming over her shoulderather parents,Lady Gerville, Gunnora and Runilda.</p><p>\"He likes my hair. I must wearitdown for him. Rememberthat,Runilda,\" she cried, then was out in the hall and runningto keep up with her husband's much longer steps. Muchtoherrelief, Paen stopped at the topof thestairs. He turned as if to speak, then suddenly frowned as he caught sight of herflushed and breathless state.</p> <p>Avelynforcedher gaping, gasping mouth closed and suckedair in throughher nose. She would not normally have beenso out of breath from this little jog, but suspectedshe had stillnot fully recovered from the binding.</p><p>\"Iam sorry,wife. Iforget you are such a little thing. Imust get used tomeasuring mystepstoyours. \"</p><p>\"Little?\" Avelynnearly wept atthe word. Noonehadevercalledherlittle.</p><p>\"Aye. Well, not as scrawny as most women, thank God. I should fear your getting ill,or my crushing you, werethat the case. Fortunately,you are well rounded andhave somemeatonyourbones,soIwill not lose you in the linens. But you are still muchsmaller than I, and Ishall have to learn to walkslower with you. \"</p><p>Paen was busy drawing her handthroughhisarm as he spoke, sosheknew he wasnot aware ofthe manyexpressions that flew across her face. Avelyn was not surehow she should feel afterthisproclamation. Wellroundedand with somemeat on her bones did not soundallthat complimentary, but at leasthe did not seem repulsed. Before she could decideifhe was genuinely pleased withher or was just making the best of things,he had finished anchoring her to his sideand started down the stairs.</p><p>Avelyn wasfinefor the firstfewsteps, but thenthegreat hall came intoviewwith the trestletablesandcelebrating throng, and she began to slow. Paennoticedat once andwas quicktoguess the reasonfor it.</p><p>\"You are not to fear your cousins,\" he ordered. \"They shall not trouble you again. \"</p><p>Her gaze slid over hisfirmexpression curiously, but she didnot question himon how he couldassure that. Instead she took a deep breath andstayed close toher new husband as theyentered the hall. The silencethat fell over thetables as their return was noted was discomfiting. Avelyn feltherselfflush and verymuch feared she wasmost definitely resembling that cherry in her red gown. As she took her seat at the trestle table, she casta nervous glance in the directionof her three cousins, but they were silent, eyes fastened firmly ontheir trenchers. It appearedthey would not bother her again,she realized with somethingclose to awe, and hadto wonder how Paen had managed it. Noamount of threats orbeatingsby Warin or her fatherhad achievedit, yet somehow in just a few moments before chasingupstairs after her, Paen had managedtosilence the terrible trio.</p> <p>That realization made Avelyn peer at her new husband with eyes shiningwith gratitude. Not that he seemed to notice. Hewasbusy filling the trencher theywere sharing withfresh food. Avelynwatchedwith renewed amazement as he pilediton untilit wasa heaping mountainof food.</p><p>Avelyn was just frettingover the possibility that he had concluded from her size thatshe must eat like apig, when she was distracted bythereturn of herparentsand Lady Gerville. She smiledat them alla littlenervously, thenturned her attention back tothe trencher. The man was running through the food like therewas notomorrow.</p><p>Almost half thepile was already gone. It wouldseem it wasn'tacomment onher size. She tookinhismuscular physique with new respect andwas caught staring whenhe suddenly stoppedeatingtoglanceat her.</p><p>\"You are not eating. Are younot hungry?\"</p><p>Avelyn tore her eyes away fromhislegsand raised her head to nod swiftly. \"In truth,I am famished, my lord. I have not eaten sincethe day beforeyesterday. \"</p><p>He shook hishead. \" Tis no wonderyou fainted, then. \" Glancing about,he raised a hand toget the attentionof several servants, who immediately scurried forward.</p><p>Within moments the trencher containedanothermountain of food.</p><p>\"Eat,\" he orderedthe momentthe servants moved away, and even helda piece of cheeseto her lips. Flushing with an oddmixture of embarrassmentand pleasure at this romantic gesture, Avelyn opened her mouthto take a biteofthe cheeseand nearly choked whenhe popped the whole thing intoher mouth. The momentshe'd managedto swallow the cheese,he had more at herlips. Avelyn soon realizedthat this was no romantic gesture. Her husband wasfeeding her asif he feared she would not feed herself. The man was either blindor daft,for anyone else wholooked ather would assume that she ate too much, though they would be wrong. Avelyn often skipped meals and went without - itsimply didn't seem tomake muchdifferenceto hersize.</p><p>Paen continued to feed her until she finallyprotestedwith a laugh that she could not possibly eat another bite. He grinnedather tinkling laughterand setdown his latest offering with a nod.</p><p>\"You did well,\" heoffered as ifpraising a child. Avelyn shook herhead with bemusement,then glancedto the side ata touch onher arm. Hermother and Lady Gerville stood atherback now.</p><p>Runilda,Gunnora and Lady Gerville's maid, Sely, were with them.</p><p>\" 'Tis time for the bedding. \"</p><p>Avelyn's amusement vanished and she swallowed thickly at her mother's announcement. She had been so busy with one worry or another since the ceremony thatshe had completelyforgotten about this partof the wedding. Feeling the heat of a blush enter her face, she avoidedlooking at Paen androsereluctantlyto be led above stairs.</p><p>Avelyn glided through the preparations in a fog. She felt rather likesomeone heading for their own hanging - knowing it was coming, knowing it would be unpleasant, but helplessto prevent it. They would allsee her naked. To Avelyn this was the most horrible event that couldevertakeplace, and herbrain was completely flummoxed at the very idea that itwould happen and she could donaught toprevent or avoid it.</p><p>\"Are youall right, dear?\"Her mother's concerned voice made it through the fog shrouding Avelyn's mind. Knowing she wouldn't be able to speak, she merely nodded inanswer and slid naked under the bed linens Lady Gervillewas holdingup for her. She had barely settled there whenthe soundofmale voices and laughter sounded muffled through thedoor. Avelyn unconsciously clutched the linen close as the sound drew nearer. Thenthe door crashedopen andatangle of male bodies burstinto the room. Paen was deepin their midst, already half nakedand besetby nearlyhalf a dozenpairsofhandsstripping away article after article of clothing.</p><p>Within seconds of their entering the room, the bedlinenwas brieflytorn away. She wasexposed only longenough for Paen to bethrust into the bed beside her, but Avelyn dieda thousanddeaths in that time,those seconds lasting an eternity as she feltherbodyscoured by all those eyes.</p><p>\"Oh, aye, ye luckysod!\"someone cried. \"She'll makea fine pillow for yerhead of a knight. \"</p><p>\"Aye, and keep ye warmduring long cold winters too,\" someone elsesaid. Then Paen was in thebed and Avelyn quickly tuggedthe linens back to her neck.</p><p>Theroom emptied outas quicklyas it had filled, the women following themen out, until Avelyn and Paenwereleftalone, though Avelyn hardly noticed. She was in somethingofadazedstate as she marveled over the fact that not a single rude comment about her size had been made. In fact, the men had sounded truly congratulatorytoward her husband, as if hehad gained himself aprize. She enjoyed thatfor afullmoment before some part of hermind suggested thatperhaps not only hercousins had been intimidatedbyhernew husband.</p><p>\"Wife?\"</p><p>Avelynglancedtoward Paen andrealized that she had been so consumedwith worry at the being-naked-in-front-of-everyone part that she had not allowed her mind tocontinueonpastthat. Now itstruck her that it was timeforthe bedding. She tried to swallow,but there was nothing to swallow. Her mouth was asdryas dust. She was also having troublebreathing again, although she was most definitely unbound now.</p><p>Avelyn's mother had explained all that would happen this night, asa good mother should. Ithadn't soundedterribly attractive or dignified,but her mother had assured herit would befine. Avelyn found that hard to believe at the moment as herhusband shifted to lean over her cringing figure. Her thoughts died abruptly asPaenkissed her. She stiffened under the caress, herlips pressing tighter together as hismouth drifted over hers. She was uncertain whether she liked the caress. Before she could makeuphermind, she felt his handon her breast throughthelinensand gave a start of surprise. She opened her mouthon a protest and foundit suddenlyfilled. Avelyn was pretty sure it was histongue,thoughshe had no idea whyhe would put itinside hermouth. Unlesshe waschecking to seethatshe had all her teeth.</p><p>He tasted of the whiskey he'd drunk at dinner, which wasrathernice. She waited for the examination to be over, sure he mustbepleased to learnthat shedid indeed have all her teeth, but it was a lengthyinvestigation and stirred some rather odd sensationsinher. Avelyn had the overpowering urge tosuck on that tongue,and perhaps to examine his teeth as well. Deciding the sucking part might be an aberration while the examiningof his teeth would probably be acceptable, sheleft off the sucking and slidher own tongue forwardto moveit tentatively around inside his mouth.</p><p>She didn't gettofeel much in the way of teeth.</p><p>The momenther tongue moved in,his began towrestlewith hers. Thisstirred anotherwhole passelof feelings inside hersothat Avelyn did not notice that he was tuggingthelinenawayfrom her breasts until it was almost gone. Shemade a quick grabfor it, but it was too late. Avelyn supposed she shouldn'tbe embarrassedto find herself naked in bed with her husband. After all, he had surely seen herwhen they had whipped the linen awayto placehim in bed. Onthe other hand, thathad been a quick glimpse and surely he hadn'tseen much? She had nointerest in his seeing more.</p><p>Avelyn had barelycome to that realization when Paen began to pull away from the kiss. She knewatonce that he would wish to peeratthe breasts he had exposed.</p><p>Embarrassed and ashamedat their verylargesize, shepromptly slidher arms around his neck and pulledhimback, kissinghim with an earnestnessthat had been missing earlier. She even gave into the urge tosuck on his tongue as she had wished to do earlier. Anything to distract him from looking at what his cleverhands had revealed.</p><p>Avelyn sensedhis surpriseat heraggressivebehavior,and was surprised in turn when hisown kiss becamemoreintense. Shefelt hishand at herbreastagain. This timeshe did notstart at his touch, but arched into the caress as herbody demanded.</p><p>His actions were having amostodd affect onher. Avelyn's nipples weresuddenly quite sensitive and tingling as he fondled andpinched at them, something shehad never experiencedbefore. She had neverthought ofher breastsas beingcapable of suchpleasant sensations. She had only ever thought ofthem as something God gave womento feed babes, butit was most definitely pleasure swelling andzinging from hernipples outward.</p><p>After several moments in which her entire body became a mass of wanton pleasure, Paenagain attempted to break their kiss. Swamped bythepleasure he was creatingin her, Avelyn almost let him, but then fearrearedinside her. Afraidthat he would be repulsed if he saw her nakedand that he would surely turn away fromher then, she tightened her arms aroundhisneck. He stilled, thenreturnedto caressing and kissing her,apparently ready to woo her abit more,but Avelyn knewthat she could notkeephimso for muchlonger. For a moment, she wasat a loss as towhat to do;then a brilliant idea popped into her mind. Shewouldput out the candle. He wouldnot be disgusted if he could notsee her. Removing one ofthe armsholding him to her, she reached blindly up and tothe side, trying to find the candle her mother had left burning on the chest at the head of the bed.</p><p>Avelyn couldn't findthecandle at firstand wassodistracted with her blind hunt thatshe didn't notice her husband'shand creeping lower until it reached and cupped the apex ofherthighs. She jerked beneathhim, amoan slipping from her mouth into his as all the pleasure he had been stirringsuddenly coalesced there. Her search for the candlebecamea bit frantic then, herhand sweepingacross the surface of the chest a tadwildly. She definitely felt it when herhand hitthe candleholder... hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The softthud that followedhadan ominous tonetoit.</p><p>Avelynthen broke thekiss herself, glancingdesperatelytowardthe chest. The candle was nowhere in sight. She had knocked it clearoff the chest. Yet the room was stilllight. Avelyn was about to twist in bedto lookand be sure that it had gone out when Paen's mouth suddenly latched onto one nipple. She stiffened in bedand peered down atthe top of hisheadwithcombinedpleasure andhorror. Had he seen her naked? Dear God, that felt good. And she had thoughthishand caressingher breast pleasurable!Should hebe doing that, though?Babeswere the ones whowere supposed tosuckle atawoman's breast. What had he seen before lowering his mouthtoherbreast? Had he... Her scattered thoughts died abruptly as his hand slid beneath the linen still covering her hips and found the core ofheragain.</p><p>Her mother hadn'tmentioned this part,Avelyn thought vaguely as her body began tohum. She was quite sure shewould have recalledhermother mentioning this. Nay.</p> <p>She hadn't mentioned it. Avelyn was sooverwhelmed with thesensations he was raising in her that it tookhera moment to realize that his head hadrisen and he could now see her naked. At least from the waistup - - -and he was frowning.</p><p>Disappointmentimmediately doused the pleasure Avelyn had been experiencing.</p><p>He was disgusted withher. He abhorredthe verysight of her. That realization was just sinkingin when hesuddenlyleaptfrom thebed, bundled herup inthelinensand chargedfor the door.</p><p>What washe doing? she wondered in horror. Surelyhe would not take her below andhumiliate her before all?Muchtoherrelief, he did not cart herbelow topublicly humiliateher,butmerely dumped her in thehall like a bedpan needing emptying, moved toleanoverthe railingand bellow something tothosebelow, then lefther standing thereandchargedback into the room.</p><p>Avelynstood in the hallway, clutchingthe linen abouther and staring afterhim forlornly as herheart began tobreak. Then her eyessettled with disinterest on the flames licking their way up the bed drapes.</p> <p>\"Fire,\" shebreathed. Her eyes widened as her rather slow and stunned brain realized that was exactlywhathe had yelled to those below. Fire. He wasn't dumping her likesomuch trash. He mightnot even have been horrifiedby whathehad seen of her. He was setting her out in the hallto keep her out of harm's waywhile he fought thefire her candle had obviouslystarted.</p><p>Oh! He was so braveandgallant! And hewas at risk ofbeing burnt,she realized as she watched him snatch up his braes and bat thefire with them. Drawing the sheetmore securely around herself, she tucked the end betweenherskin and the linen, then racedin to hisaid.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Snatching up his tunic, Avelyn joined herhusband in batting atthe flames. She had barelybegun todo so when Paen snatched her up in his arms andhustledher out of the room.</p><p>\"Oh, but I wish to help,\" Avelyn protested as he set her down inthe hall.</p><p>Paen merelygrunted and shook his head ashe rushed tothehead of the stairsto bellow \"Fire!\" once more. Then heraced back intothe room.</p> <p>Avelyn watched himbattle the flames, but her mind was somewhat distracted as the firecast its goldenglow overhis naked muscular body. She'dknownhe was tall and large. That much had beenobvious even dressed,but naked she saw just how largehe was. There was no paddingin this man's clothing to impresspeople. He was solidly built, his legs as strong and muscular as a horse, his chest wide and barrel-like, and his arms as big aroundas her thighs, butmuch firmer.</p><p>Avelyn'seyeswere just dropping tohisbehind when Paen grabbed the burning bed drapes and turned away, ripping them freeto fall to the floor. it wasthen she recalled herwater basin. Runilda hadanticipated her hotand sweatystate after the embarrassing binding incident and had possessed theforethought to bring up abasin of waterforher to have arefreshing andquick wash before slidingnaked into bed.</p><p>The used water had notbeenremoved and stillsat on the chest by thefireplace.</p><p>Ignoringhis order to remain where shewas, Avelynraced into the room, snatched up the basin and rushed toward Paen withit. She hadnearly reachedhim whenher sheet begantounravel from around her. Before she could grab atthefalling cloth, it tangled itself around her feet,tripping her up. Paenturned ather strangled cryas she tumbled toward the floor. Hegrabbed herarmin an effort to save her. While he managedto prevent her falling on her face, Avelyn ended up crashingto herknees, the waterinthe basin splashing everywhere as her dampface wassuddenly mere inches from an alienpart of his body. Her mother haddescribed this appendage whilepreparingher for her wedding night, butAvelyn had never seenone. She was certainly seeing hisnow, and inrather close proximity.</p><p>She found herselffrozen inplace, her wideeyes fixated onhisstaff. Her mother had said very little onthematterof the appearance of this appendage other thanto describe itas similar to a finger. \"But larger, onehopes,\" she'd addedina mutter.</p><p>Avelyn suspected she hadn't been meant to hearthe addedcomment. Paen's was certainly larger than a finger,but it looked nothing like one to her. A rather lumpy sausage perhaps,she thought faintly, then blinked as a drop of water dripped off the end of it, drawingher eye. Shewas gaping at the odd end of it,an openingthat seemed almost to be growing, when Paenmade a sort of choking soundthat drew herattentionupward.</p><p>Avelyn peered at his face to find it dripping as well. The waterappeared to have splashed all down the front of him. Butthat didn't explain the odd expression on his faceas his gaze slidfrom where shekneltto hisgroin. Avelyn followed his gazeand wassurprisedto see that his staff had grown larger still,and wasemerging from itself likea molepoking itshead out of itshole. Shehad just noticed thiswhen she found herself bundledupin hisarms againandtransported quickly to thehallway.</p><p>\"Stay,\"he ordered gruffly,thenwas gone again.</p> <p>Biting her lip, Avelyn moved to lean against the doorjamb, watching anxiously as he battled theblaze. The curtains he'dripped away fromthebed had fallenacross a chest, whichhad caughtfire andwasnow burning merrily. Paenwasattemptingto beat out those flames withthebraes in one hand and thetunic she'd used earlier in the other. As she watchedhim,Avelynrecalled herfather's comments about this man as they'd prepared for the wedding. Lord Staughtonhad spoken of himoften.</p><p>She supposed he'd been trying to allay any worries she may have as the day approached. Her father had thoughtheknew much about Paen. Avelyn supposed thathe'd known all thata man might thinkimportant, butit hadseemed verylittleto her.</p><p>According to her father, Paen had the unusual skillof beingableto wield asword in both hands. It madehima formidableopponent. To addto that, he was also said to be relentless. He,like his fatherbefore him, was considered a fearsome warrior.</p><p>That had been the selling pointinher father's contracting the betrothal when Lord Gervillehad approached him on the subject. Theydid not live far apart, and even thenas a young lad, Paen had been large and strong for his age and had shown every sign offollowing inhis father's fearsome footsteps. Lord Straughton had wanted his daughter's husband to beable to care for her and keep her safe.</p><p>Watching her husband battlingthe firein their bedchamber, Avelyn began to understand why. The flames were lickingout at him like tongues of poisonous snakes, yet he did not shrink. His strong arms whirled in a constant, unflagging motion. Still, she feared that his determination would not be enough. It seemedthat theflames were dancing around him,moving oneway and then another,as ifthey hada mind oftheir own and playedpeekaboo games with him.</p><p>Wincingas a sliver gouged into the tender skinof one finger, she glanced downto see that she had clenched herfingerson the door frame in worry. Lettinggo of the wood, she started to step forward into the room, then paused and glanced toward the stairs instead. She wasamazed that no one had notedthefire yet orheard Paen's call for help. Surely the smokehad reached the great hall by now, she thought,then realized that insteadit was traveling up the tower. Of course, the celebrations below hadgrownboisterous and loud. It seemed they had noteven heard Paen's shouts, or someonewould be here with pails of water. Pushingaway fromthe door, Avelynran for the stairs.</p><p>She triedshoutingfrom thetop of themas Paen had done, but went unheard once again. Avelyn grabbed up the hem of her sheet and hurried down the stairs, shrieking at the top ofher lungs. She wasnearly at the bottom before anyone heard her,and they all seemed to hear heratonce,for the noisesdied out as allheads turnedher way.</p><p>Avelynwaited forsomereaction - a suddenrushoffeet,alarmed shouting for water, a surge of rescuers rushing her - but instead there wassudden and complete stillnessas all gaped at her. Unawareof thepicture she made with her lush curves andfullround breastsattempting topush theirwayup out of the damp and clinging sheetshe wore. Unaware her hairtumbled abouther prettyflushed face in glorious chestnut waves thatbillowed over hershoulders and down toher knees. Unaware those who had thoughther merelypleasing ortoo plumpin herdark,dowdy gowns and with her hair pulled starkly back from her face, were now reassessing their opinions and seeingheras a luscious, sensualfeast. Avelyn's bewilderment gave way to impatience. At thatmoment, her husband was upstairsbattling alone to save the castle,yet here they allsat likebumpsona log.</p><p>\"Are youall deaf?\"she cried in amazed fury. \"Willyou let the castleburn down around you? Thebedchamber is afire!\"</p><p>Warin was thefirst to move. Bounding to hisfeet, he belatedly bellowed for water as he rushed toward her. But hedid notfly past her andrace up the stairs asshe'd expected, instead pausingbefore her, blocking her fromthe view of thosebelow.</p><p>\"Youhad bestretireabovestairs, sister. You are awakening appetites herethat werenot fed by the feast. \"</p><p>Avelyn stared at him in bewilderment, thennotedhis eyes skating uncomfortably downward, then away. She peered down at herself, realizing only then thatnot only wassheclad only in asheet, but that it wasdamp and clinging indecently toher curves. She sighedinwardly at making sucha pickle of herself yet again,but then, whatwas one more humiliation? Solong as Paen had aid, she thought, relievedwhen thedoor to the kitchens swungopen andseveral servantsrushedout, pails in hand, splashing water as theyran. The clangor and rustle of at least a hundred men rising and rushing forward to claimthose pails reassured her. They would not all get one, nor could theyall fit upstairs, butatleastthey intendedto do somethingabout the fire.</p><p>\"Forma line to the well!\" She heard herfather roar in an attemptto bring some orderto the chaos. Shaking her head, Avelyn turned and hurried back upstairs, awarethatherbrother was hard on her heels.</p><p>Thesmoke hadthickened while she was gone, andAvelyn's heart lodgedinher throat when she reached the room and couldn't spot Paen. it wasas ifa thick fog had driftedinthe window and obscured the room. Whatever was in the chesthad caused a black smoke thickerandmore blinding than any she'd before seen.</p><p>\"Wait here. \"Warin pushed herto the side, then took the pail off the first manto arrive and charged into the room. Avelyn stood to theside ofthe door, tryingto stay out of the wayyet unableto keepfrom tryingto glimpse into the room everyfew seconds, eager to see that Paenwas onhis feetstill andhad not beenovercomeby the smoke. But her attempts toseeintothe room put her in theway of themen rushing up with water. She found herself urgedtothe side by man after man, each of them smilingat herin onemanneror another. These smilesseemed oddto Avelyn.</p><p>Shehad never been the recipient of them before. Her father's men were always pleasant to her, but these smiles seemed different somehow.</p><p>She hadlittle time topuzzle overthe matter. Her mother was suddenly there, grasping her arm and leading heraway through the flow of men to her brother's room. Avelyn found herself subjected toan examination as her motherchecked for injuries, then explained how the fire had started, thoughshe only admitted thatshe'd knockedthe candle to the floor,notthat she'd been trying to cloak her body in darkness when she'd done it. She also left out how Paen's kisses had been distracting her, but suspected that her blushand hermother's commonsensewere enough to give her a generalidea ofthe situation.</p><p>Lady Straughton patted her hand reassuringly and was murmuring something along thelinesof \"accidentshappen\" whenthe door opened andher father led a smoke-streaked Warininto theroom. Avelyn rushed to hisside.</p><p>\"IsPaen well? He was notinjured,was he?\"she asked anxiously.</p><p>\"Were you injured?\" her mother asked almost in the same moment, reaching Warin and beginning to examine him much as she'd doneAvelyn.</p><p>\"I am fine, Mother,\" Warin assured her quickly, then turned his attention to Avelyn,who wasstrugglingwith guilt forsuch a poor showing of concern for a brother she loved dearly. \"AsforPaen, I think heburnt hishands. And hetookin a lotof smoke. I thinkhe - \"</p><p>\"Where do you think you are going, young lady?\" her father growled as she started for the door.</p><p>\"I... Warin saidPaen burnt his handsandI thoughtto - \"</p><p>\"Lady Christina willsee to him,\" her motherassured her, taking her shouldersto turn her away from the door.</p><p>\"But - \"</p><p>\"Nay. No buts, my girl,\"Lord Straughtonsaidfirmly. \"Youarehardlydressedto be flitting about thecastle. His mother istending to himin the room they were given.</p><p>Wewill see hecomes hereonce she is finished. \"Heendedhisstern words with a patontheshoulder, thenturned to his wife with a new concern. \"The room did not fare well. Avelyn and Paen cannot staythere tonight. We shallhaveto make alternate arrangements. At least fortonight. Hopefully,tomorrow we might repair itenoughto be habitable. I - \"</p><p>\"They can takemy room,\" Warin interrupted. \"I cansleep in thegreathall this night. \"</p><p>Lord Straughton turned a concerned gaze on his smoke-streaked son,but nodded with relief at this easy solution to his problem. \"I shall have a bathput in our room for yousoyou might clean up,\" he announced, steering him towardthedoor with a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\"Mayhap you should have one senttoLord and Lady Gerville's room for Paen as well, husband,\"Lady Straughton suggested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Avelyn's father paused and glanced back, his gaze landing on his wife and daughter. Hislips quirkedup fondly. \"Aye. And one for our girltoo,\" he assured her.</p><p>Avelyn glanceddown at herself asthe doorclosed behind the twomen, surprised tosee that thewhitelinen she'd been running about inwas now agray-black mess, as were her armsand shoulders and probably her face as well. She was sureshehad not been in that condition whenshe'd run below - herlinenhad been damp but still white when she'd peered at herself below. She couldonly think thatstanding in the door of the room as the thick black smoke had billowedout had covered her in the stuff. She definitely needed abath.</p><p>\"You did afinejob on yourhands. \"</p> <p>Paen grunted athis mother's wry statement as shetendedto his injuries. He was tryingnot to think on the matter too much. Hishands werepaininghim terribly. He feltas ifhe were holding them in a vat of boiling oil.</p><p>Hisgaze slid tothedoor oftheroom andhewondered wherehisbride had got to. She had triedtohelphim, he knew,but had beenmoreof ahindrance at first. At least until she'd fetched the others. Thathadprobably saved his life. The smokehad not been sobad with justthe bedcurtains burning, butonce the firehad reached the chest, somethinginside had madethesmoke thick andacrid. It had filledhislungs likea black mass,choking himto the point thathe'd become woozyand lost his footing. He'd tumbledtohis hands and knees amid the fire,his hands landingon the burning bed curtains.</p><p>The biteof the firehad roused him quickly andhe hadstruggled backto hisfeet justas Warin had rushed intotheroom witha pailof water. The first pailof water haddone little good, but the arrivalof several morepails and even more men had put out the fireand aided in removing a gooddealof the smoke from the room. Still, it had been a relief forPaento finally leavethat room. He'd spent the pastseveral moments half bent over choking upblack bile. He hardly recalled being led into this room and still had no idea where his wife had got to.</p><p>\"Where is - \"</p><p>\"Ibelieveshe is up the hall,\" ChristinaGerville murmured.</p> <p>Paen cast a discomfited gaze his mother's way. The womanhad always seemed to be able to readhis mind. Itsometimes lefthim feeling waryaround her, as if he must guardhis thoughts.</p><p>\"Aye. She is,\"Wimarcannounced, catching the questionand answer between his son and wife as he enteredthe room. \"Straughtonsays hermotheris seeing her cleaned up. They aresending a bathupfor youas well. Her brother hasgiven up his room tothe twoof you. \" He paused at his son's side andgrimaced on seeing his damagedhands. \"Not that it wouldappear that privacy will beneeded this night. You can hardly do aughtwiththose. \" Heraised an eyebrowhopefully. \"Ido notsuppose you were abletomanage thebedding ere - \"</p><p>\"Nay,\" Paen said miserably, for truly he had been all ready for the bedding.</p><p>Avelyn had been as warm and soft as he'd anticipated. She'dsmelledsweetly of summerflowersandbeenas passionate and responsiveas aman could wish. Truly, he was resenting the fire'sinterruption. Wereitnot forthat, he wouldno doubt be buried deep in her moist warmth by now. Paen heaved a little sigh of disappointment. His sigh was echoed by hisfather.</p><p>\"How did the fire start?\" Lord Gerville asked after allowing a moment to grieve for alostopportunity.</p><p>Paen shook his head in bewilderment. \"I am not sure. I think a candle got knocked to thefloor, though I amnot sure how. \"</p> <p>\"Hmmm. Oh, here isyourbath,\" Wimarc said as aknock soundedon the door before several servants entered bearing thenecessities.</p><p>\"I shallstay and helpyou,\" Lady Gervilleannounced, drawing Paen's alarmed gaze. He'd not beenbathed by his mother since... well, he couldnotrecallever being bathedbyher. There had alwaysbeennurses and servants to seetothe task as a child. Asan adult, he certainly had never considered accepting her help, andhad nointentionof startingnow.</p><p>\"Ineednoaid. I can manage on my own,\" he said firmly. She did not appear the least impressed with his sterntone. Infact, she merely smiled withamusement. This wasthe troublewith parents,of course. Such was his reputation on the battlefield that men had beenknownto quiver atthevery mention of hisname, yet his mother hadnot theslightest fear of him.</p><p>\"Manageonyour own, willyou?\" she asked dryly, drawinghis attentionfrom his silent griping. Noting the meaningful look she cast down at his hands,Paen followed her gazeand nearly gasped. The painhad stopped shortlyafterhisfather's arrival, whenshe'dsmeared acool, soothingbalm on it. He'dpaid littleattentionto what she was doing after that,his mindtakenupwiththe factthathe'dnot managedtobed his bride. Now he saw that while he'd beenbemoaning thatlost opportunity, she'dbeen bandaging his hands, and bandaging them. Dear Lord, his hands were now linen-covered stumps. Therewasn't a finger or even a thumb to beseen. It seemed he would need help to bathe.</p><p>His mind had barely begun to rebelat thatthought when he realizedthat not only would he need help bathing, but the stateof his handshadput an end toanyhope of bedding his wife this night, or the next night for that matter. He stared at his bandaged stumpswithdismay. There was no wayhe could caress her to thepoint of excitement, or even hold her with them. To manage consummating the wedding right now, he'dhaveto have Avelyn either seat herself on - or bend over - something at his hip levelso that he need only drive his staff home. Such an act would be humiliating andpainful for his newbride without any caresses to prepare herand exciteher, and he had no desiretocause Avelyneither humiliation orpain. It seemed the beddinghadtobe delayed...indefinitely.</p><p>Avelyn opened her eyes and stared blanklyat the dark bedclothes overhead, confused for a moment as to howher light blue bed draping hadbeen switched for these dark redones withouther waking. Then she realized shewasn't inher own bed. Full recollection quickly followed, and her head shot to the side, her eyes findingthe man asleep beside her.</p><p>Her husband, Paen Gerville.</p><p>The man was soundasleep,but evenin sleep his expressionwas pained. Her gaze dropped to his bandagedhands and she sighed. Avelyn had hardly believed her eyes when he'd first entered the room last night. His bandaged hands, along with the painedexpression on his face,had beenenough toconvince her that the bedding wasn't likely to take place. She'd been right. Paen had looked at her longand hard where she lay naked under the bed linens, his eyesseeming to devour her; thenhe'd heaved a sigh andmoved to the bedside, only to pause andstare from his handsto the bedlinens with frustration.</p> <p>Realizing that he wasn'table to lift the linens himself,Avelyn had quickly pulled them asidefor him to get into bed, then tucked themaround him,biting herlipwhen she noted the embarrassed flush on his face. Onceshe'd finished and lain backon herside ofthe bed, he'd sighed heavily, closed his eyes and gone to sleep.</p><p>Thathadbeenit for their wedding night. Sighingherself, Avelynhadturnedonher sideawayfrom him andforced herself to sleep. It had taken a while. Hermindhad been awhirl withguilt atcausing the firethat had injured him,as well regretthat she wouldn't experience whatwouldhavefollowed theexcitingkissesand caressesher husbandhadlavished uponher.</p><p>Now it was morning, but judging bythepained expression on her husband'sface even in sleep, Avelyn was sureitwould be bestto let himrest as long as he was wont to. Her motherhad always said that sleep was the best cure for any illness or injury.</p><p>Easing fromthe bed, Avelyn released asmall relieved sighas shemanagedto gain her feetwithout waking the man. Leaving him there, shescurriedto the chesther fatherhad brought from herold room. Her red dresshad gone up in flames, along with the others she'd left out to wearinthe next few days. She wouldhave to raid her chest for another gown. Very consciousof her nudity, Avelyn donned the first gown that came to hand,a light brown one she often wore while working around the castle. She frowned over its wrinkled state asshesmoothed it down, but all ofher gowns would bewrinkledfrom being packed away.</p><p>Giving up onthewrinkles,Avelyn glanced toward herhusband to be sure he still slept, then eased out ofthe room and made herway downto the great hall. She paused on the stairs, a small sigh slippingfrom her lipswhenshe saw that the rest of the castle wasalready apparentlyup. There wasn't a single guest or servantasleepon the hall floor. Theonlypeople in the room wereher three cousins, seatedat the trestle table. Avelyn nearlyturned aroundand started back upthe stairs,but where wouldshe go?She wouldn'trisk waking herhusband, and all the other roomswere occupied.</p><p>Realizing there was nothingfor it, she straightened hershoulders and continued down the last fewsteps. Avelyncrossed the hall to the table with herhead high, hopingherproud attitude wouldhideherreluctancetobe there.</p><p>\"Well. \"</p><p>Avelyn stiffened at thelong-drawn-out word fromhercousin Eunice.</p><p>\"You do not lookanydifferent,\" shefinishedand Avelyn couldn't resist glancing herway with surprise.</p><p>\"Different?\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Eunicesaid dryly. \"Igatheryour husband couldn't bring himselfto bed you...as we feared. Else surelyyou wouldlook different. \"</p><p>\"Nay,Of course he didn't, Eunice,\" Hugo saidwhile Avelyn silently wondered how she would lookifshe'd been bedded. \"Else the proof of her innocence would even nowbe hanging from the stair banister. \"</p><p>Avelyn did not needexplanation ofthis\"proofof herinnocence. \" She knewher cousinreferred to thebloodied sheet thatwould have resulted from herhusband's breaching her maiden's veil. Avelyn had attended the wedding of her neighbor and. witnessed the rituals and ceremonythere.</p><p>\"My husband's hands wereinjured in the fire,\" she said with all thedignity she could muster. \"He was unabletocomplete thedeed fornow. \"</p><p>\"Is thatwhat he toldyou?\"Eunice asked withpityeven as Hugo laughedand said,\" 'Tisn'this hands he needed to completethe deed. \"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Staci grinned. \"Was his piffleburntin the fire as well?\"</p><p>Avelyn ground her teeth as her dignity deserted her and she found herself swamped with uncertainty. Her cousins must have spotted the flicker of her expression, for - likewolves spotting a weak deer on the edge of a herd - they surrounded her and began to tear away atevery bit of esteem shehad.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Paen was dreaminghe was fighting a fire. Inhissleep, he hadnothing touseto combat theflames. Out ofdesperation liebegan to beat at themwith hisbare hands, forcing himselftoignore the agonyas theroaring fire licked at thefleshof his fingers andpalms. Thepainwas excruciatingandfinally forced him awake.</p><p>Paen sat up witha gasp andraised his hands before his faceto stareatthem as the fiery pain followed himinto wakefulness. He stared blankly at his bandaged hands for amoment, thenlet them drop into hislapand fell back on thebed as he recalled that hehadindeed burned his hands. He stared hard at the cloth overhanging thebed, trying toblockout the throbbingpain as his mind wentoverthe events of the nightbefore. Hisweddingnight hadn't been what he'd hoped for.</p><p>The thoughtmade Paen glance to the side, only to findthe bed beside himempty.</p><p>His wifehad alreadyrisen and left, it seemed. Scowling, he kicked thelinens aside withhis feet, then sat up again. It seemed hewould have to discuss a few thingswith his wifewhen hefound her. He wouldn't be toohard onher, Paen assured himself.</p><p>She was newto being abride, after all, but Avelynneededto learnthe thingsthat wouldmake her agood wife. Thingssuch as thata wife did notleavethe beduntil herhusbandwas up and about as well. What if he'd wished to finishwhat they'dleft incomplete the night before? Not that he could do a proper job of it with his hands as they were, but still... Histhoughts ended as he stood up besidethe bedand stared around the room, slowly becoming awarethat he didn't haveanything to wear. All his clothes, every last stitch,had been destroyed in the fire the night before,boththose that he'dbeen strippedof by the menon the wayinthe door, and those in his chest, whichhad gone up in flames. Paen had worn only the linenhis mother had used to dry him after his bath.</p><p>The memory of that humiliating bath madehimnow scowl atthelinenin question.</p><p>Being bathed like a baby and by his own mother had beensomewhat distressing.</p><p>Not that she'dseemed upset by theordeal. She'd simply rolledup hersleevesand set to the taskas ifbathing one ofthose dogs ofhersat Gerville. Thenshe'd ordered him out of the bath,quicklydriedhim, then wrapped the linen aroundhis waistand sent him down to this room.</p><p>Paen shook his head at thememory, then turned his attention to contemplating the linen on the floor. it was apparent that therewas nowayhe'd be able to pickup the bit of cloth and wrap it about his waistagain. Hetoed it briefly, wonderingif he couldn't get his foot beneath itand lift it enough to catchit onone of his bandaged hands. Then,of course, he would have tomaneuver it around until he had it about his waist - Who was he kidding? Paenwonderedwith irritation. There was no way he could get the linen fastened around his waist by himself. As unpleasant as it was to acknowledge he needed help, he did. Heneededto borrowclothesfrom someone, andhe neededhelpin donning them.</p><p>If hiswife were here,he could have garnered her aid in dealing withtheproblem.</p><p>Butshe wasn'there - another reason he would have to talk to herabout notleaving the bedchamberbefore he was up and about.</p><p>Irritated alloveragain at her absence, he crossed the room to thedoor,hoping that hisparentswere stillin their own room and could assist him in thematter. The latch gave him abit of trouble, butin the endhemanaged it and made his way out into thehall. He was halfway to the room hisparentshad been given at the opposite endof thehall when the dooracross from itopened and Lord and Lady Straughton steppedout.</p><p>Paen stoppedabruptly,as didtheoldercouple. For amoment, the three of them were frozeninplace; his newin-lawsgaping, he dropping hisbandagedhandsto hide himselfas best he could. Then the door to his parents' room opened and Wimarc Gervillestepped out. Paengruntedat the sight of him, the small sound drawinghis father's gaze his way.</p><p>\"Son!\" LordGerville roared, hisgaze shifting from Lordand Lady Straughtonto his nude son. \"What thedevilare ye doingstanding about the hall bare-arsed?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sighing, Paen merely shook his head, pausing whenheglimpsed the open door beside him. It was the doorto Avelyn's room. The damagehadn't beenas badas it had seemed lastnight, he realized with surprise. The fireappeared to have been confinedmostly to thebed. The smoke had still been denselast night whenhe'd beenled fromthe room, and he'd been sure thewhole room had gone up. He'dbeen wrong.</p><p>Hope rising in him thathis chestmay also have escapedworse damage, Paen turned abruptlyand entered the room,forgetting all about the trio in the halluntil he heard hisfather's gruffapologiesonhis behalf.</p><p>Ignoring the sound, Paenwalked around the ruined bed in search of his chest.</p> <p>Any hope died the moment his eyes landed on thecharredmess. Thetop of the chest wasmissingaltogether, leavingthe blackened bottom and sides, andafew black ashes inits bottom. There would be nothing he could salvage from there, he acknowledgedwitha sigh. Thenhis gazeshifted to the smoky remains of his clothes from thenight before. In his desperation, he'd used his tunic and braesto beat at the flames last night. Now the bits of clothing layin two crumpled piles on thefloor.</p><p>Grimacing, Paen toed each lump of material. They had been doused with water when the men had rushedinwith the buckets, butwere now dry. Very dry. They seemed to havealmost hardened in theshapethey'd been left to Hein.</p><p>\"Dear God! What atimeyou havehadof it here!\"</p><p>Paen glanced toward his father ashe entered the room. The older man shook his head and closed the door, then leanedheavily against it with a sigh. When Paen made no comment,WimarcGerville frowned and moved forward.</p><p>\"You need clothes, of course. I should have thoughtof that. It wasnot until you turnedinto thisroom that Irealized why you were wandering aroundnaked. \"</p> <p>\"I have clothes here,\" Paensaid, thenadmitted with no littlereluctance, \"Ineed helpdonning them, though. \"</p><p>\"Well, of course Ishallhelp you,son. Whatclothes have you... ?\" His voice trailed off when he followed Paen's gazeto the stifflittlebundleson the floor. \"Dear God! Surely you do notintend to wear those? They are a ruin!\"</p><p>Bending, hemanagedto lift the pilethat appeared to bewhat was leftof Paen's tunic. Ashepeeled it offthe floor, it madeatearing sort of soundand stretched straightas aboard ashe heldit up. \"You cannot wearthis. I shallfetch you one of mytunics and - \"</p><p>\"Yourtunics will notfitme. \"</p><p>Wimarc paused halfway to thedoor and turnedback with a frown. His shoulders sagged as he took in hisson's size. \"Aye. You have outstripped me. When did you growto be such a large lad?\"Hescowled briefly,then shook his head and waved the hardenedcloth. \"But you cannot wear this. Perhaps Warin - \"</p><p>\"I'llnot go beggingfor clothes. Myown clothes will do me untilwe reach home,\"</p> <p>Paen insisted grimly. \"Justgive the shirt ashake;it willsoften up with wear. \"</p><p>Wimarc opened his mouth as if to argue, then shookhishead again and started back. \"Warin's clothes probably wouldnotfit either. Tisthe truth, you have six inchesin height on everymanhere. \"</p><p>It tookmore than a bitof a shake to make Paen's clothingwearable. His father had topull the cloth out of its set position and beat it energetically before it was suitable for donning - if suitable could be said about clothing that was smoke-stained and full of holes. But while Paen's tunic andbraes smelledof smoke andweremarred with holes and stains, they covered all the importantbits, and Paen decided they would have to do. His handswere aching, his headnow hurt,and he hadnopatience for searching out clothes that might be freeof stains and smells but would tear at thefirst movement he made. He would just have to see that they returned home at once. While Paen wasn't much concerned withthe latest looks in clothing, and usuallykept onlytwo outfits so thathealways had one to wear while the other was beingcleaned, his brother Adam had been of a size with him andhad been more of a follower of fashion. There were one ortwo outfits in his brother's room back atGerville. Paencould make doas he was until they got home.</p><p>Paen doubted that his motherwould be pleased attheneed to travelat once. The intention had been torest herefor afew daysso that Avelyn could become better acquainted with them all beforetheyreturned home. Thathadbeenhis mother'sidea.</p><p>Paen didn'tunderstand whatmade her think the girl would need timeto get to know them better. She had the rest of their lives forthat. However, hismother had insisted, and he and his father had agreed to please her. Now, however, necessity had changed theirplans. Or atleast, his plans, Paen thoughtas he followed his father into thehallway. His mother andfathercouldstaybehindifthey wished. Butheand his wifewould be leaving as soon as he'd broken hisfast. They would go fetch his new squire, then - \"Oh, there isyour mother. \"</p><p>Paen glanced along the hall to see his mother speaking to Lord and Lady Straughton.</p><p>\"Go on belowandwe shallcatch up,\" hisfather suggested.</p><p>Nodding,Paen continued to the stairs as his fathermovedtojointhe trio.</p> <p>Avelynwasthe first person he spotted onreaching the great hall. His wife was seated atthe table. She wasn't alone. Thosecousins of herswere with her, and, judging by her unhappy expression,he guessed the triowere being rude again. Paen reached instinctively for his sword, grimacing when his bandaged hand bumped againstits hilt. Hecouldn't use it.</p><p>Leftweaponless, Paen was reduced to glaring at the trio as he approached.</p><p>Fortunately for his mood,thethree ofthem were cowardly enoughto flee thetable even without his sword to back up his irritation. Releasing a satisfiedgrunt, Paen dropped to sit on the benchbeside his wife,bringing her surprised face his way.</p><p>\"Husband, you are up. \"</p><p>Paen didn't comment on hersurprise. He also showed what he considered to be great restraint in notrebuking her for comingbelow on her own andleaving himto fend for himself. Instead,he asked, \"Whatwereyour cousins saying to make you so unhappy?\"</p><p>Much to his interest, his bride flushedwith embarrassment and refused tomeet his gaze, but instead stared at her goblet ofmead assheanswered, \"Nothingworth repeating, my lord. In fact, I have already forgotten. \" Clearing her throat,she said brightly,\"Are you hungry,my lord husband?Would you care to break yourfast withme?\"</p><p>Paen was sure she was lying and considered explaining toher that wivesdid not lie to husbands about anything, not even insignificant little things like whatever bodiersome words theircousinsmightsay, butthe bright smilesheturned onhim wasrather dazzlingand hersoftvoice addressing him as \"my lord husband\" was musicto hisears. When sheheld out a bit of bread for himhe found I himself forgetting his irritation and reaching for the offering, only to pause when his bandagedhandrosebetween them, a fat, round stumpthat was as useless as it looked.</p><p>Sighing heavily,he let the handdrop and turnedto the table, findingthat he was now theoneembarrassed.</p><p>\"Icould feedyou, my lord,\" Avelyn offered gently,understanding theproblem.</p><p>\"Iam not hungry,\" Paen lied grimly, refusing tosubject himself to the humiliation of his new wife having to feedhim likethe veriestbabe. Heglancedto the sideto see Avelyn peering at him with something dangerously closeto pity and growled, \"Eat. \"</p><p>She hesitated, and Paen was about to again order her to eat, when a servant hurried up with a goblet of mead for him.</p><p>Relievedthat herewassomething he felt he could manage, Paen carefully lifted both bandagedhands to hold the goblet between them and lifted it to his mouth.</p><p>Reliefcoursed through him asAvelyn finally turned her attention away from him,and Paen lowered thegoblet alittle and swallowed ashe glanced at her. She waslifting a bitof cheeseto her mouth,and hewatched, suddenly dry-mouthed, as she bit off a piece and chewed itslowly. The action raised yet anotherhunger inhimhe was incapableof satisfying, andPaen felt his insides turn over with despair. He couldn't eat,couldn't dresshimself, and couldn't even bed his wife. Married life was falling somewhatshort ofbliss for Paeri. In fact, it seemed tomoreresemblehell. Once he had his new squire with him things wouldbe better, he assured himself, watching Avelyn take another biteof food. At least then he would have theboyto helphim dress and eat. Itwould still leave him unabletobed his wife,but - Paen's thoughts died andhe swallowed hard as his wifepoked her pink little tongue outand ranitoverher lips,-both upper andlower, catchingand cleaning away anylittle crumb she'd leftbehind. In his mind, Paen could almost feelher lickinghis lips - and things further southon hisbody,parts thathad not been burned and didn'treallycarethathis hands were.</p><p>The sudden clang as his goblethit the table and the cool splash ofliquid down his chestandinto his lap drewPaen's attention back to reality. Getting to his feet with a surprised roar,he stared down at the mess he'd madeand feltembarrassment paint his cheeks a bright redas his wife gaped up at him.</p><p>She openedher mouth to speak, but it was a voice behind them thatspokewith concern. \"Son, are you all right?\"</p><p>Turningslowly, hefelthis\" shoulders sagas he watched hismother and father as well as Lord and Lady Straughtonhurrying across thegreathall toward them. It seemed there had been witnesses to hisembarrassing showof ineptitude.</p><p>Paen closed his eyes briefly, then shook his head as he opened them and announced,\"Avelyn and I are leavingin an hour for Hargrove to collect my squire, then continue on to Gerville. You may accompany us or remain behind as you wish. \"</p><p>Ignoring the startled gasps this announcement invoked, heturned on his heeland strode out of the keep in search of the stablesto see his horse readied. It was the only possession that remained intact after one night of marriage. Paen hoped this wasn'tan omenof things to come.</p><p>\"I am sorry, my dear. The original plan was to visithere for a bit after the wedding so that you could get used to us. However, I fear that Paen - \" Lady Gerville sighed, then explained, \"He has only the clothes on his back to wear; everything else went up inthe fire. Andwith hishands injured asthey are, he cannot eat without aid... ordress... or anything else really. Having hisnewsquire withhim will be a great aid I amsure, and - \"</p><p>\" Tis allright, my lady,\"Avelyn interrupted gently. \"I understand. I am not upset. \"</p><p>Her gaze slid to her mother's face, andAvelyn knew the samecould notbe said forthat lady. Margeria Straughton was obviously upsetatthe idea of her daughter leaving so soon. She was alsoobviouslybitingher tongueon the subject. Avelyn was sure that Paen's motherwas aware of the other woman'sdistress, and that it was propelling her need to excuse her son's sudden decision.</p><p>\"I supposeI should gosee that everythingis packedand ready togo,\" Avelyn said calmly. \"Mother?Wouldyou like to accompany me?\"</p><p>\"Yes,dear. \" MargeriaStraughton caught the hand Avelyn held outand grasped it almostdesperately as theywalked toward thestairs. Sheheld on as ifshe would never let go. Avelyn knew the nexthourwas going to be the hardest of her life. She was about to leave her mother, her father,her brother - everyone andeverything she had ever knownand loved. She was about to follow her new husband, aman she hardlyknew, across England toher new home - a placeshe had neverseen, full of people she'd nevermetanddidn't know. Avelyn had neverexpected that growingup could be so hard and painful. It seemedtoherthatmenhadit easier. Warin, when he married,would bring his wife here, andwould never beexpected to make a new placefor himself somewhere else. Itdidn't seem fair.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\"Please, Paen,ride in the cart. You will cause furtherdamage to your hands if you - \"</p><p>\"Iwill not ride in the cartlike an oldwomanor an ailing babe. 'Sides,there isno room in the cart,whatwiththe maidsandeverything else init. My wife appearsto be taking half of Straughtoncastle with her. \"</p><p>Avelyn andher mother pausedat the foot of the castle steps and exchanged unhappy glances. Theyhad seenhim pull himself up intothe saddleas they started down the stairs, using his bandaged hands despite theirinjury, but now theywere close enough to seethe resultsofthis effort. Paenwas a sicklypallidcolor,and sweat had brokenout on his foreheadand upper lip. This spoke more clearly of the painthe action had caused him than if he had screamed aloud in agony.</p><p>Still he satstiff andstraightin the saddle, pride holding himerect ashe struggled toget the reins wrappedaround his bandagedhands.</p><p>Giving up on him,his mother turnedand moved to joinAvelyn and hermother at the steps,concern tracingdeep lines on her face. \"He will do himselfmore injury withhis foolish pride than thefire did. \"</p><p>Avelyn bit her lip and nodded. Her eyes shifted to her husband's stubborn expression,and she considered what to do. Margeria Straughtonhad not raised a fool. Avelyn tookafter hermother - a frightfully intelligent woman - and as such, had listened wellto all her mother's training. Lady Straughtonhad not thought it necessaryto only trainher in how to run' a household, or how todeal with staff.</p><p>Margeria hadthought it important to trainher daughter in howto deal with men as well. The first lesson she'd taught her was that men were the most stubborn, pigheaded, proudcreaturesGod had created andthat a woman hadto be smartand quick-thinking to keep them fromkillingthemselves with that pride.</p><p>This, in Avelyn's judgment, was one of those times her motherhad warnedher about. She hadn't adoubt in the world that herhusband would insiston continuing their journey despite his injured hands, riskinginfectionand death simplyto deny weakness. Life with her fatherand brother had taught her that men did tend to be foolishthatway.</p><p>\"Father - mayhap you could help me - \"Paen said, fumbling with the reins.</p><p>When sheheard Paen ask his father towrap the reinsaround his bandaged hands and tie them so thathecould control his horse, she decided that this wasone of those times when a smartwifehadtoact to save a husband from his own pride.</p><p>\"Oh, dear,\" she gasped loudly as she rushed forward to stand at her father-in-law's side, distracting him fromdoing ashis son had requested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\" 'Oh, dear'?\" WimarcGerville eyedher with what she suspected was hope. Her husbandmerely looked leery as he stared at her.</p><p>\"'Oh, dear,'what?\"Paen asked, expression grim.</p><p>Avelyn batted her eyelashesat her new husbandand forcedan uncertainsmile. \"I fear Ido not knowhow to ride. \"</p> <p>\"What?\" Both men peered atherblankly.</p><p>Avelyn shrugged mildly. \"I have never neededto know. I have never traveled fromStraughton. Ihad expected to ride in the cart, but I underestimated all the things that Motherintendedtosendwithme. \"</p><p>Paen staredat hisyoung wife. She was fresh-faced androsy-cheeked and smiling brilliantlyupat him. She wasas lovelyas aspringday, butshe was also turning out to be the mosthelpless of creatures. She'd faintedattheir wedding, proved herself clumsy enough to start a fireontheir wedding night, and nowadmitted she could not ride. It did seem that Avelyn was not the strong, skilled bride he'd hoped for.</p><p>His gaze slid to his father's face,but the man was looking back atthewomenby the step. His mother waslooking concerned, but his bride's mother was looking merely bewildered. Before Paen could puzzlethat out,Avelyn captured hisattention again. \"Mayhap you could teach metoride?\"</p><p>Paen noted the way the confusion on Lady Straughton's face cleared at this suggestion,buthad no time to ponder the matter, for his mother was suddenly rushing forward,a beamingsmile on her face.</p> <p>\"Well! What a marvelousidea! You shall ride with Paen andheshallshow you how to ride. It should only take a couple of days. Why, by the time we arrive back at Gerville, he shall have you an expertrider. Lovely. \"</p><p>Paen shifted in the saddle, feeling as though he'd rather missed something.</p><p>Everyoneseemed so damned pleased, he was sure there was something amiss, but couldnot figure outwhat. He wasfrowningoverthe matter whenhiswife grabbed herbrother's handanddragged him forward. \"Help me mount, please, Warin. \"</p><p>\"I can help you to...\" Paen's voicefaded away. It was too late to make such a protest - Warin had already set her on themountbefore him.</p><p>She turnedher head to smile overher shoulder atPaenwith a sweetness that somehowmadehim suspicious. Shrugging the uncomfortable feeling away, Paen grumbledunderhis breath about wives andwomeningeneral,then reached around to try totakethe reins,but she grabbed them upinstead and asked innocently, \"If you aretoteachme to ride, shouldI nothold the reins?\"</p><p>Paenhesitated, reluctant to give up control of hismount,then satbackwith a sigh. \"Very well. \"</p> <p>Hedidn'tfeelanybetterwhen shebeamed at him. Hewrappedhisarms around herwaist almost reluctantly, felt her snuggle into him, and suspected it was goingto be along journey home to Gerville.</p><p>Avelyn wasterribly pleased with herself. She finally felt that she'ddone something rightas a wife. She may have made a muddle out of thewedding ceremony, the celebratory meal and the wedding night, but here todayshe'd taken her first right step. She'doutsmarted herhusband andtricked him into saving his hands further injury.</p><p>Avelynfrowned at her own thoughts. DearLord, she was proud abouttricking herhusband, aboutusingsly lies tolet himthink she couldn't ride horsebacksothat she would have an excuse toride with himand take the reins. This was truly asad day, she decided and sighed heavily, thenglanced downather mother asthe older woman puta hand on her knee through her gown.</p><p>\"You willdo well,daughter,\" she said in reassuring tones as if having read Avelyn's thoughts. Shesqueezed her knee. \"We love you and willvisit soon. \"</p><p>Avelyn felt tears wellupin her eyesandblinked in an effort to stop them, butthey would not be stopped. She was leaving Straughton, the only home she'd ever known, and riding off into the unknown with a man she barely knew. It was a terrifying step to take, terrifying and painful.</p><p>\"I love you, Mama,\" she whispered, then was relieved when Paen grunted something ofa good-byeand put his heels to his mount'ssides, urging it to move.</p><p>Blinking awayher tears, she tightened her hold on the reins and paid attentionto directing theanimalout of Straughton'sbailey.</p><p>Avelyn hadnot told a complete lie whenconvincing herhusband that she should ride before him. She'dlied aboutnotbeingable to ride - she'd ridden horseback since she was veryyoung and was quite goodatit. However,shehadn't beenon long journeys. There had never been any need to leaveStraughton. Avelyn supposed she'dimagined that they'd ride for anhour, stopto rest and refreshthemselves,then ride abit more and stop for a nooning meal andanother rest, then head outagain.</p> <p>She thought wrong. Theyate their noon meal inthesaddle - fruit,cheeseand bread thatPaen had her retrieve from a bagdanglingfrom the saddle. Or,that wasto say, she ate. His handsbandaged asthey were, Paen had heen unableto eat. He'd made the attempt,trying to hold a hunk ofcheese in one bandaged paw, buthad barely manageda bite or two before the cheese had tumbledto the ground. She'd offered tofeed him, but Paenhadshakenhis head and growled that he wasn't hungry.</p><p>Avelyn's heart had achedfor him. The man wastoo proud to accept her helpand so wouldgo hungry. She would have thought him a complete idiot, except that surelythis was no worse than her nonsense with the dress. She supposed pride made foolsof everyone.</p><p>For the most part,they rode in silencethroughoutthe day. It was a reliefwhen they rode into a clearingin earlyevening and Paen announced that they would stop there forthe night. Avelyn dismounted quickly and eagerly - too quickly and eagerly.</p><p>Her feet hit the ground and' nearlycollapsed beneathher. Shewasforcedto clutch at her husband's legandthe saddletostay upright.</p><p>\"Are youall right, Avelyn?\"Wimarc Gerville was at herside at once, takingher arm to help her remain upright.</p><p>Avelyn managed a smile and nodded, tooembarrassedto peer upat herhusband as she released his leg. Sheallowed hernewfather-in-law to lead herto a fallentree at the edge of the clearing and settledthere to begin stretching her legs as he returned tohelphis wife dismount. Much to Avelyn's relief,Lady Gerville wasnot completely unaffected by the length oftimein the saddle either and leanedon her husband's arm as he led her to join Avelyn.</p><p>\"You ladies rest a bit while we seetocamp,\" Lord Gerville instructed.</p><p>Avelyn and Lady Gerville watched him walk back to join the men now dismounting and seeing to the horses. Both women sighed as one, then shared wry smiles.</p><p>\"Are youas soreand weary as I am?\" Lady Gerville asked with self-deprecating amusement.</p><p>Avelyn nodded, adding,\"Thank goodness it isnot just me. Not that Iam happy you aresore too,\"she added quickly.</p><p>\"Iunderstand,mydear,\" Lady Gerville assured her gently.</p><p>Avelyn relaxed.</p><p>\"I am justsorry thatall of this has conspiredto force you to leave Straughton earlier than planned. Ihad hoped youwould have the chance toget to know us all better ere having to leave yourfamily. \"</p><p>Avelyn glanced away and swallowed the lump in her throat,then forced a shrug.</p><p>\"We can get to know each other on thejourneyandonce at Gerville. \"</p><p>\"Aye, and Ihope that we willbecome close. My one great sorrowwas thatIhad nogirlswithmyboys. While I love my sons, I envy your mother having one ofeach, andam pleasedtowelcome youas my daughter. \"</p><p>Avelyn smiled andreached out to squeezethe woman'shand, thenturned her attention forwardas theother women joined them. Lady Helenand Diamandahad alsoridden on horseback, and Avelyn wasn't surprised to seethat they were just as stiff as sheand Lady Gerville. She was,however, surprised to notethat the maids followingthem were also moving stiffly. Itseemedthat riding in thecarthad not beenmuch better than ridinghorseback.</p><p>\"Lord Gerville is having the men setupthe tents first so that we mightready them whilethemen finish withtheotherchoresto make camp,\" Diamanda announced as she dropped onto the log on theother side of Lady Gerville.</p><p>Paen's mother murmuredsomething ofan acknowledgment ofthisinformation as Helen settlednexttothe girl;thentheyall fellsilent astheywatchedthemen produce tents and beginto unroll the heavy cloth to set them up. Therewere two tents,one largerthan the other. Avelynknew thata travelingtent was an unusual luxury,and supposed thatthefact that theywere traveling with twoof themwas a sign thather husbandandhis familywerevery wealthy. That was nice to know, butAvelyn had a more immediate concern. She had a serious and somewhaturgent need torelieve herself, butwas rather embarrassedtobring the matter up. Bodilyfunctions were not somethinggirls were encouragedto discuss,and she'd been trying to ignore the necessity, but it was getting to thepoint whereshe could no longerignore it.</p><p>Avelyn felt sure shewas about to burstwhena pair of legs were suddenlyin front of her face. Raising her head, shepeered up at her husband with acombination of relief and question.</p><p>\"The tent isup,\" he announced and held out a handtohelphertoherfeet.</p><p>Avelyn hesitated, then ignored hisbandaged hand and got stiffly to her feet onher own, sighing whenher unwillingness tocause him further injury to his bandaged handsbrought a scowl to his face. He wasdoing his best to pretend he wasn't injured,andapparently didn't appreciate her not playing along.</p><p>Shaking her head, shetookhis arm and listenedas he led her across the clearing tothe larger tent.</p><p>\"This will beour tent,\" he announced,surprising her. \"I have assigned two mento unload whatever you want to outfit it. They arealready starting on thebedding, but if there is aught elseyou want, you musttell them. \"</p><p>\"Aye,husband,\"Avelynmurmured, glancing behindthemand relievedto note that Runilda was following. She had no idea how to outfit a tent and doubted Runilda did either, but hopefully, between the two ofthem, they could workit out.</p><p>\"Do you have anypreference astowhere wearrangethebedding?\" Avelynasked as he lifted thetentflap forhertoenter.</p><p>Paen shrugged as she releasedhisarm and stepped past him into the tent. \"The back right cornershould dowell enough,\" hesuggested. \"Is there anything else ere I helpthe others?\"</p><p>\"Aye. \" Avelyn felt a blush rise up her cheeksand staredat the corner hehad gesturedtoas she admitted, \"Ihave need touse the garderobe, my lord. And a bath after the dusty journey today would not go amiss. \" With the embarrassing part of the request outof theway,she turned toward the tent flap saying,\"Irealizethat both are out of the question out here, but...\" Her voicedied as shesaw that he wasno longer standing in thetent-flap entrance.</p><p>Frowning, shewalked to theopening and looked out. Her husbandwas quite tall, a good head above mostof the men. Avelyn had noproblemspotting him,but was bewildered tosee that he was on the other side ofthecamp,talking earnestly to his mother and father.</p><p>\"Agarderobe? She truly asked about a garderobeand a bath?\"Wimarc Gerville shared hisson'sobvious horror.</p><p>\"Aye. What do I do? Should Ihave the men dig one and - \"</p><p>\"And what?Prop your tentover it? Dear Lord. \" His father shook his head at the very idea.</p><p>\"I hardly think she expects you todig a garderobe for her, Paen,\" Lady Gerville interrupted with some exasperation. \"If the girlhas togo now,she wouldhardly be willing, or even able, to waitabout for hours whilethe men dig one for her. No doubt she wasaskingwhatsort of arrangements were used out here while traveling. \"</p><p>\"Oh. Aye, she may have been,\"Paen agreed with relief. \"She was asking about a bath too, to get rid of thedust from travel, andmust realizethat I cannotpossibly present her with one ofthose. \"</p><p>\"Aye. Just so. So...find her a nice secluded spot by the riverwhere she may tend toboth matters,\" his mother suggested gently.</p><p>\"Aye. \" He nodded, obviouslyrelieved to have thecrisisresolved.</p><p>LadyGerville shook her head as shewatched him return to his tent. \"Hehas spent much toomuch time on Crusade. \"</p><p>\"Hmm. \"Wimarcnodded hisagreement, but wasgrinningas he did. \"Helikes her.</p><p>The boyis eager to pleaseher. \"</p><p>\"Aye, he does. \"LadyGerville joined him in grinning. \"Aye. He does. We chose well. \"</p><p>\"You chosewell, my love. \" Wimarcgave credit where it was due. \"Though 'tis still beyond me how you knewwhen she was a wee babethat she would growup perfect forthe boy. \"</p><p>\"Thatis easy. I imagined you with her mother. \"</p><p>\"What?\" Wimarc Gervilleturnedonhis wife inshock. \"Youwhat?\"</p><p>\"Well, 'twas obviouseventhen that Paenwouldgrowup tobe just like you. He was very like you even as a small lad. AndAvelyn resembledher mother very much.</p><p>Isimply tried to imagine how you and Lady Straughton should have got onwere it notfor Lord Straughtonand myself, andit did seem to methat the two of you would have got alongrather well. \"</p><p>\"Well, we... I...she... She is afinewoman,but...But I love you,mypet. \"</p><p>Lady Gervillegrinned ather husband'sdiscomfort. \"Aye. But it would not have beenhard for you to love heras well. Andthat waswhat decided me on Avelyn for our son. \"</p><p>Wimarc opened his mouth,then clampeditshut again,smartenough tolet this topic die without further comment. A man eventually learned which topics were dangerous, and which were safe to discuss with his wife. This was definitely one of those dangerous ones.</p><p>\"Wife?\" Paen stuckhishead into his tent,relaxingwhen he spied his wife busy withher maid arranging the furs that were to be their bed for the night. It had occurred to him thatifshe hadto \"visit the garderobe\" urgently,she might not wait about while heran off to discussthematterwith hisparents. Hewas relieved to see that she had not been so impulsive or foolish as to head out on her own.

The habit, one he indulged whenever alone, was so ingrained that he was not even aware he was doingit. He led herdownto the river's edge, thenalongit for a ways before he was satisfied that the spot he'd chosen wasout of the way. Thenhe turned to face her and hesitated.</p><p>Paen wasn't sure what to do now. They were married. She was his wife.</p><p>However, they hadn't consummatedthe marriage. Did thatmean he could stayand watch her bathe, ordid chivalry insist he allow her privacy?Thebaser sideof him, the lower half really, wasurging himto stay and watch. The-upper half - only a very tinyportion ofhis head - was urging him to do the chivalrous thing. She had proven herself shy on their wedding night. He'dhadquite a struggle relieving her of the linen she'd claspedsotightly toherself. Thenthefire had rather ruined his view. Intruth, he didn't getmuch of alook at all,but that was besidethepoint. She was obviously still shy around him, and he really shouldallowherprivacywhile she bathed.</p> <p>Paen wasn'tterriblypleasedwith this dictate of his conscience, but salved his lower halfby assuring himself that he wouldsee her soon enough. As soon as his hands had healed and he was able, in fact.</p><p>\"My lord husband?\"</p><p>Husband. Paen smiledat the word. Hewas a husband now. Her husband. Hehad realized that, of course, in some abstract sort of way, but having her call him husband somehow made itmore realto him. It made him feel rather proud and puffedup. He was a husband. He belongedto someone as his fatherand mother belonged to each other. He hada wife of hisown. Itmade him feel... well... warm inside... and a little olderactually,herealized with surprise. Hefelt kind ofgrown up.</p><p>\"Husband?\"</p><p>Pushing his thoughtsaway,Paen turned his attention to his littlewife. \"Aye?\"</p> <p>\"What are we doing here?\"</p><p>\"You said you wished to bathe and tend other matters. This seems a suitable spot. \"</p><p>Avelyn glancedaround with neweyes, then sighed, \"Oh, dear. \"</p><p>Paen frowned. \"Irealize'tis a bit rough,but 'tis the best I can do. whilst we are traveling. Surelyyou realizeI cannot present you with a proper bath and - \"</p><p>\"Oh, aye. Of course, husband. I am quite pleased. This is lovely,\"she interrupted toassurehim.</p><p>\"Thenwhythe sigh and 'Oh, dear'?\"</p> <p>\"I... It is just that Iwish you had explained where we were going when you collectedme. I might then havethought to bringsomething to dry myselfwith and - \" Shestopped andbit her lip when he cursed. Then he used onebandaged handto urge her around and kept it at her backas he hustled her back the waythey'd come.</p><p>Avelyn wasflushed and outof breathbythe time they broke backout ofthetrees andinto camp. He hurried her to theirtent.</p><p>\"Fetch what you need. Ishall wait here,\" heinstructed, then took up position outside the tent flap,standing straight and stern,arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>Avelyn peered at him for a moment,tryingto decideifhewasannoyed withher for beingsucha bother,then decided that dallying would no doubt annoyhim more and ducked quicklyintothe tent. She returned moments later with a bagholding what she would need, andfound herself relieved of the bundle. Paen caught itup between his bandagedhands and hurried back the way they'd come,leaving herto run after him. Avelyn was beginning to feel a bit like ahorse onthebit, butremained silent as she ran to keepup with her husband. It seemed he'd forgotten that he needed to measurehis steps. Shewas not going to remind him.</p><p>He led herback to the spot he'd first chosen, butstopped dead on stepping into thesmallclearing. Directlyon hisheels andunprepared for thesudden halt, Avelyn stepped onhis heels and nearly raced up the back of hislegs before she caught herself, then muttered an apology and steadied herself with a hand on his back.</p><p>When there wasnoresponsetoherapology, shesteppedaround her husband to see whatheldhis attention. Her eyebrowsrose somewhat at the sight of Lordand Lady Gerville kissingin the clearing. Avelyn had thought the affection her parents shared was rare. Itappeared it wasn't asunusual as she'd thought.</p><p>Muttering something under his breath about stealing their spot, Paenturned on his heel andstartedback outof the clearing, Avelynfollowing once again. Much toher relief, theymoved a little slower thistime,and it was only a couple of moments before he foundanotherspot hewas satisfiedwith.</p><p>\"I shallbejuston the other side of thatbush doyou needme,\" werehisparting words; then he set her bag downandleftheralonein the clearing.</p> <p>Avelyn stared at the spot where he haddisappeared backinto thetrees andfelt her heart swell with gratitude at his consideration in allowing her privacy. It hadn't occurred toher thathemightexpectto stand watchand... well... watch, but she realized now that hewould have been wellwithin his rights to do so. Shewas terribly gratefulhe hadn't... until she pondered why he might not want to.</p><p>Of course he wouldn't want to. Who would wish to see her naked? Having thoroughly depressed herselfwithherown contrary thoughts, Avelyn sighed and set about undressingherself, notin the least uncomfortablethathe wason the other side of a bush fromher. She had no fear he wouldlook. Shewas as safe as if she were in her own room with thedoorbarred. Paen would never bother trying to catch a glimpse of her.</p><p>He was going to look. No, he wasn't. Aye, hewould. Nay,he would not.</p><p>Paen argued with himself repeatedlyas he listened tothesoft rustlings of hiswife undressing a few feet away. He really wanted to look. Hewas going to. She was his wife. His property. He had a right to look.</p><p>But it was terribly unchivalrous,and reallyrather childish behavior. Itwould be reminiscent ofa stunthe andhis brother hadpulledwhen young striplings, peeking through the bushes ata bathingvillage lass. Aye, it was beneath him topeek through the bushesat hisnaked wife like somelustylad,he toldhimself.</p><p>A soft plopsounded. Something hittingthe ground? Her dress mayhap? Or was it already hershift? Was she standing there all creamy skin under the waning sun? He couldalmost pictureher with her soft brownhair falling over her fullplump breasts andbrushing over the topsof her roundedhips. Paen licked his lipsat the imagethat formedin his mind. He had to look. He justhad to. It was killinghim. He wasno better than alustylad. He - Was supposedto be guarding her. Hewas tomake sure that no one absconded withher, and that she came to no harm like being attacked, or taken away, or drowning. Hisearspickedup asoftsplashingsound, andhestiffened. Was that a \"bathingaway the day'sdust\" sort of splash, orwasita drowning-type splash?It could be either,he reasoned, turning to facethebushes that stoodbetween himand his naked,wet wife.</p><p>Nakedand wet. Thewords ranthroughhishead, and he decidedthat hereally should just check. Just a quick peek to besureshe wasall right.</p><p>Of course,his conscienceargued, hecouldcall out to be sureshewaswelland never look.</p><p>\"Shut up,\" Paen mutteredto hisconscience and used his bandaged hands to shove thebranchesof thebush asidetopeekthrough.</p><p>\"Tsk,tsk,tsk. Peeking at her like an uncouth youth. \"</p><p>Paen released the bushes so quickly at those amused words that he slapped himself inthe face with the branch. Cursing, he straightened and turned to glare at his father. Hemanagedto infusesome self-righteous indignation into his voice. \"I was just checking to be sure she was all right. \"</p><p>Wimarc Gerville arched one eyebrow at that claimand grinned ashe settled to sit beside Paen. \"Then I raised you wrong. I would look if it was yourmother. Hell, I would be inthe waterwithher. \"</p><p>Paen smiled athisfather's disgruntled tone, thenasked the obvious. \"Thenwhy are younot in the riverwithMother?\"</p><p>\"I would be if you had not come along. I was getting ready to when you interrupted us. Your motherdecided wehad best behaveifyou twowere so near. \"</p><p>His resentment was obvious.</p><p>\"Sorry. \" Paenwas having trouble sounding sincere. It wasgood to know that he wasn'tthe onlyonesuffering. \"I had not thoughtyou evennoticedus. \"</p><p>\"Oh, aye. Your mother noticed. You knowshe has eyes intheback of herhead when it comes toyou boys. \"Thelastword hadbarelyleft Lord Gerville'smouth whena pained look followed it.</p><p>Paen feltguilt swamphim as it always did whenhisthoughts turned to his dead brother. He felt guilty for not havingbeenable to save him,guilty at being the oneto survive. He was silent for a long moment until his father cleared his throat and distracted them both from the subjectof Adam's death. \"So? Was she?\"</p><p>\"Waswho what?\" Paen asked inbewilderment.</p><p>\"Wasyoung Avelynall right?\"</p><p>\"Oh, aye. \" Paen sighed heavily. \"She was frolicking neck deep in water. \"</p><p>Wimarc laughed at Paen's rueful voice, knowing that his wife being up to herneck inwater had notbeen whathe'd hopedto spot while peeking throughthe bushes.</p><p>\"Mayhapyoushould check again. Tis a tad quiet now on the other side of the branches. \"</p><p>Paen hesitated, then shifted onto his knees on the boulder and pushed the shrubbery aside again to peerthrough. The sight ofhiswife floatingon the water's surface,still and pale, drewan abrupt cursefrom him.</p><p>\"Whatis it?\" Wimarc asked, catchinghis son'salarm, but Paen was too busy scrambling to rescue his wife to answer.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Thewater had beencool at first, butAvelyn hadadjusted to it quickly. Shehad always enjoyed swimming. Whenshewasa child, her parents hadoften takenher andWarin on picnicsbythe river. Avelyn hadalwayslooked forward to those trips, but then Aunt Isidore hadarrived with the cousins. They, of course, then hadto be included in the picnics and had ruinedthem forAvelyn with theirtaunts abouther being a great whale floatinginthe river. These things were alwayssaid far enough away fromthe adultstobesure they were not overheard. Avelynhad taken lessand less joy in swimming untilshe'd refusedto do it at all. At least she'dnot forgotten how. She'd swum for a bit, and was now floatinghappily in the water, completely relaxed inthe knowledgethatherhusbandwould be sure no one disturbed her.</p><p>Avelyn had barelyhadthatthought when she was suddenly caught under the arms and liftedout of the water. Avelyn almost screamed, buta glance down showed a pair of bandaged stumps poking out fromunder her armsand sherealized it washer husband. As quickly as that, thoselinen-covered stumpsshifted her aboutand she found herself clutched to his massive chest. Stunnedand confused, she heardher husbandshoutingrather incoherently about drowning and devils as heran out of the water with her.</p><p>Avelyn tried to figure outwhat hewas trying totell her. Had his mother or father drowned just upriver asshe'dbathed? Orhadtheybeenattackedand killed by some devilsas she lay floating obliviously?</p><p>Horror consumed her at the thought of either possibility befalling her lovely in-laws. Avelyn lay still against herhusband's chest ashe raced outof the waterand began to crash throughthewoods. There was nomistaking the tension in the arms holding hertight to his chest. Her husbandwasina panic. Paen did notseem the sort topaniceasily, so Avelyn knew for a certainty that something was gravely wrong.</p><p>The factthathe had not even paused to let her collect her gown wasanother sign of thegravity ofthe situation. It madeherthink that theymust be under attack, for if the matter had to do with one of hisparentsdrowning, shewas quite sure he would not beracing throughthe woods carryinghis rather large and heavy, naked wife.</p><p>Avelyncould have askedhim whathad occurred, but hehad gone silent since dragging her out of the water, and she feared he might be trying to keep their whereabouts asecret iftheywereunderattack. Itdid seem that she should notslow him down bymaking himattempt to talkwhile running, soshe forced herself to remain stillandsilent in his arms.</p><p>When they reached the campsite, Avelyn was suddenly mortified by her unclothed state. She noted the startledreactionsof themen as Paen charged through with hisnaked bundle. it wasobvious they had no idea whatwasgoingon. When Paen finally began to slow,Avelyn decided she might now ask what had occurredto causethisuproar,but before she could,Paen had lifted her and she was slammed downon her belly across the back of ahorse, knockingthe air out ofher. A bare secondpassed beforeher husbandwason the horse with her. One bare knee was inches from her face, the otherbrushing her legs and buttocks as he set thebeast into a run.</p><p>Any possibility for Avelyn to regain her breath died as shefound herself slammed repeatedly intothehorse's back. Shewas grunting with each jolt,when she became aware of somethingpressing down firmlyon herbackside. Ittook onlya moment forher to realize that it mustbeher husband's bandaged hand placed thereto hold herin place as he rodethem to safety.</p><p>Avelyn groaned between gruntsas she realizedherhusbandwas riding her around incircles,with herbare bottomup andinfull view of the men. At thatpoint she determined that iftheir men did not kill whoever hadattacked and caused all this uproar, she wouldsurely do so herself.</p><p>Avelyn soon became aware that herhusband wasspeaking again. He was talking inlow tones. Herhead was closer to thedrum of the horse's hoovesthan to his mouth, but stillshe could make out some words. They soundedlike a cross between a curse and a prayer,or perhaps a plea and a rant. He wastalking of someone named Adam andtelling whomeverhe was addressing that he couldn't take Avelyn like he had Adam. He was threatening whomever he was speaking to with dire consequences,and Avelyn was just beginningto think her husband madwhen she caught the word God and realizedit wastheir Maker he was addressing.</p><p>it was thenthat things began to jell in her head. It occurredto her that riding someone around strapped to the back of ahorsewasa commonmethod to tryto revive a drowning victim. Avelyn began tothink that she may havemisunderstood things. Perhaps Paen hadnot been shouting abouthismother or father whenhe'd pulled her from the water. Perhaps he'd thought shehad... Dear God! Her husband had mistakenherfloating for drowning. He wastryingto save herlife - wasn'tthat just the sweetestthing in theworld? That thought ended on an \"oomph\" as Paensent the horse leaping over somethingand she suffered a particularly nasty joltto her stomach. He apparently heard the whoosh ofairleaving her lungs for the handon her derrieretightened, squeezing her cheek asheurgently calledhername. Thenhe began to slow his mount. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Avelyn considered matters-forthe few brief moments it tookfor the horsetoslow toa stop. If, as she beganto think,her husband was attemptingto saveher life, she didn't thinkhewould appreciatelooking the fool if sheexplained she hadn'tbeen drowning. Therewas also thefact that she was presently starknaked, butt-up onher husband'shorse. A most humiliating situation to findoneself in. Truly, Avelyn began to wish shehadbeen drowning. Shewas still trying to decide what todo when the horse cameto a complete halt and Paenmanagedto lift and shift her onto her back in hislap,nodoubt further damaging his poor hands ashe did so.</p><p>Avelyn kept her eyes closed. She did, however, manage to drape one arm strategically across her naked breasts whilethe otherdroppeddown to allowher fingers to flop overthe patch of curlyhairat the apex of her thighs.</p><p>\"Avelyn?\"</p> <p>For a moment,she wastorn astowhattodo, and then shedecidedtogowith the nearly-drowned pretense, or at least notto deny it. She blinked her eyesopenand then let them drop closed, trying for a weak-nearly-drowned-and-oblivious-to-the-fact-that-I-am-naked attitude. She was rather hoping that if shepretended she wasn't naked, he might notnotice.</p><p>\"Avelyn?\"</p><p>\"Paen?\" Avelyn opened one eye, rather proud ofthetremble sheput in her voice.</p><p>Itmade her soundweak and nearlydrowned.</p><p>\"Thank God,\" she heard him breathe. Sheopened both eyes to seethat despite her hopes, now thatthe crisis was over he was apparently becoming aware ofher naked state. Avelyn cringed inwardly as his gaze drifted over herexposed body. She could feel the heated blush following in the wake of his eyes and shifted uncomfortably, trying to manage afetalposition on his lap.</p> <p>Her action seemedtomakehimawareof her distress,andPaen suddenly dragged hiseyesback to her face. He cleared his throat and sat up a little straighter,then suddenly dismounted, taking her with him. Avelyn found herself set gently in the grass and tookamomentto hopetherewere no bugs or worms under her bare bottom as shedrew herkneesup and clasped them toher chest in aneffort tohide as much ofherself as possible. She glancedup to find Paen removing his tunic,and felta thrill of alarmring through her. Surely he didn't plan to consummate the marriage here? Had the very sight ofher nakednessimpassioned himsothat hehad tohave her now?</p><p>That thrilling possibility died in her as he finished removing his tunic andslid it over her head. He was merely trying to cover her up, Avelyn realized, oddly disappointed. She should have expected as much, of course. She just wasn't the sort to impassionanyone, Avelynthought as he dropped to his haunchesto drawher hands into the arms of his tunic, dressing her likethe veriestchild.</p><p>\"How do youfeel?\" he asked anxiouslyonce she was covered.</p><p>\"Er...fine... thank you,\" she murmured,then becameaware that his gazehad dropped and an odd expression coveredhis face.</p><p>Avelyn glanceddown to seethathis tunic was inworse shapethan she'd realized.</p><p>Paen had hadlittlechoice in wearing the tunic andbraes they'd used to put out the fire. The smoky, holey tunic was allhe'd hadto wear, butAvelyn had notnoticed until now just how damaged his clotheshad been. The tunic smelled ofsmokeand had several holes where the fire hadburned through. One of themjust happenedto be placed such that it allowed her breast to poke through.</p> <p>Oh, dear God, Avelyn thought, blushingwhenPaen reachedout and attemptedto push her breast backinside the hole with one bandagedhand. Handicapped as he was, it was an impossible effort.</p><p>Brushinghis hands away, she took over the task herself. Avelynslipped her breastback inside the tunic, thenshifted the cloth so that thehole wasn't in quite such a dismayingspot. She then kept her head lowered, tooembarrassedto raise it andmeethis gaze.</p><p>Her downward glanceleft her staring athis bandaged hands, and Avelyn sucked in a startled breath as she actually looked at them. As thick as the bandages were, there was bloodshowing through thecloth on both hands. It looked fresh.</p><p>This little rescue attempt had apparently not been good for him.</p><p>\"My lord!\" She snatchedat his hands, only to releasethemabruptly when he drew in ahissing breath. Avelynraised her eyes to his and shook herhead slowly, amazed that he hadbeen able to carry her through his pain. \"We must get you back andtend to them. \"</p><p>Paen'sanswer was a dismissivegrunt, but hedidstand. When he offeredone bandaged stubto assisther, Avelyngrasped hisarm above the wristand got up as well,no longer caringhow she must look standing therein naught buthistunic,her damphair falling in snaky tendrils downher back. Now she was wholly concerned with her husband's well-being. Taking his elbow,sheurged him back tothe horse, thenhesitated and facedhim.</p><p>\"Shall I help you mount?\" sheaskedwithconcern.</p><p>Paen snorted at thepossibilityand merelycaught herunder the arms with his bandaged hands, neatly tossing her up ontohis horse. The action was quick, but not so quick that she did not catch the pained grimace that briefly tightened his expression. Biting hertongue to keep fromberating him forhis prideful behavior, Avelyn sat quietly as he mounted behind her and grabbed up the reins toturn the mountback toward camp.</p> <p>Lordand Lady Gervillecame rushing forwardas soon as theyre-entered camp, but Paen did notstophismount bythe other horses. Instead, herode straightto their tent. Relieved that she wouldn't need to crossthe campsite inherskimpy attire, Avelyn quickly slidoffthehorse. Out ofthecorner ofher eye, shespotted Lord and Lady Gerville rushing forwardand heardtheirconcerned questions as toher well-being. Noteager to standaround any longer than necessary in her holey tunic, she left Paen to answerandduckedinto thetent.</p><p>\"Oh, my lady!\" Runilda rushed forwardthe momentAvelyn entered, anxietyon herfaceas she grabbed her arms and looked her over. \"Are you all right?\"</p><p>\"I am fine, Runilda. Truly,\"she assured her whenthe maid's concern did not ease.</p><p>\"Oh, thank the good Lord!\" she said at last, relaxing. \"I near todied when Lady Gervillesaid youhad drowned. Thank God Lord Paen was able to bring ye back around. \" She wasbustlingAvelyn across the small tent tothe makeshift bed they'd built offurs andlinens. Themaid had beenbusy, Avelyn saw; the tentwasnow as comfortable as it could be. There waseven a flickering candle set on the chest, adding light asevening darkened the sky.</p><p>\"Now you get out ofthatwet tunic. Wemust getye warmand bundled upelse ye maycome down with thelungcomplaint,\" Runilda ordered.</p><p>\"I will not get the lung complaint,\" Avelyn assured her, but quickly stripped Paen's tunicoffas the maid movedthe candleto the floor so that she could open anddigthrough the chest. When the maid then held outa strip oflinenforher to dry off with,Avelyn waved it away. Her ride on the horse had seen to drying her. Other than her hair she was no longer damp. She was, however, eager to get dressed before Paen returned.</p><p>\"Find the bagofherbs andfresh linenswe packed away to tend the injured, Runilda,\" Avelyn instructed as shepulled onafresh shift and then accepted the black gown the girl handed her.</p><p>\"Wereyou injured?\"Runildaasked withconcern as she started hunting for the required items.</p><p>\"Nay, but my lord husband did hishands little good with all this carting me about andsuch. \"</p><p>\"Oh. Aye. Sely,Lady Gerville's maid, said that hishands were mightilyburnt,\" the girl murmured, herhead deep in one of the chests. \"She thinks 'twill be a couple weeks erehe heals, and that is only does he not do them more harm with this journey. \"</p><p>Avelyn frowned. Shehadn't beenfullyaware of how injured he was, but had suspected it wasn't good when his mother hadbeen so concernedabout his riding onthe journey backtoGerville. Shewould be glad to get thechance to see the depth of theinjury to hishands when he returned to thetent.</p><p>Avelynhad a longwait. She was just beginning tothinkshe would have togo after him when the tent flap waspulled aside.</p><p>Relieved thathehad finally arrived,Avelyn stood, a bright,welcoming smileon herfacethatfaded when she saw that it was Paen'smother and not Paen himself.</p><p>\"Oh. \" Aware that her smile was fading, she tried to rescueit, and then explained apologetically,\"I was expecting Paen. His bandagesneedrepair. \"</p><p>\"Ialready took care of that,\" Lady Gervilleassured heras she straightenedinside the tent. \"He sufferedlittle damage,thankgoodness, and does he givethem the chance to recover, shall beback to himself in a couple of weeks. \"</p><p>\"Oh. \" Avelyn sagged somewhat, disappointment surging through her. She was feeling ratherredundant asa wife. She didn't appear to be needed for anything that a wife normally did. She'd beenwedded, but hadyet to bebedded. She'd not even seen her home yet, so hadn't taken on any wifely tasks there,and seriously doubted she would beallowed to since his motherwas stillalive and welland no doubtfirmly in charge at Gerville. And now shewasn't even allowed to tend tohisinjuries as a goodwifeshould. Itbegan to look asif she wasn't really needed at all.</p><p>\"Iam sorry,Avelyn,\" Lady Gerville said. \"'Tis yourplacetotend him now. I fear it shalltake sometimefor me to get used tothefact that myson now has awife for suchthings. \"</p><p>\" 'Tis all right, mylady,\" Avelynsighed, dropping to sit on the furs: \"I fearI am something of a failure as a wife. \"</p><p>\"Oh, nay,child. \" Lady Gerville moved forward, dismayon herface. \"You are a lovely wife, and perfect for Paen. \"</p><p>\"Ibelieveyou may mean perfect for pain,'\" Avelynsaiddryly. \"Sofar I have set my parents' castle on fire, gettingPaen burnt as hetried toput it out,and increased the injury by making him thinkI was drowningso that he had to - \"</p><p>\"Making him think?\" Lady Gerville interruptedona gasp. \"You were pretending?\"</p><p>\"Nay, of course not, buthe misunderstood. Iwas just floatingon my back. Then Paen was suddenly draggingme outof thewater and lugging me around nakedas the dayI was born. \"</p><p>LadyGerville gapedin horror. \"Whydid you not say something?\"</p><p>\"I... well, at first I was too startled, and then I thought perhaps wewere being attacked. He wasshoutingsomething aboutdrowning anddevils, and I was notsure what washappening. I thought perhaps someone hadattackedand drowned you or Lord Gervilleor...\"She shrugged helplessly. \"By the time I realizedwhat wasreally amiss; I wasbare-bottomup on thebackofthe horse. \"Sheshook her head. \"I couldhardlyembarrass him byletting him know he had erred, soI let him think he had saved me. \" She fell silent, positive that Lady Gerville would be horrified byher stupidity. The woman did gape at her in a rather horrified manner for several moments.</p><p>Ducking herhead in embarrassment, Avelyn was grateful that Runilda had gone outto join Sely by the fire and so wasn't there to witness this most humiliating confession. As far as she was concerned, it was just another failure on her part. She stiffened, then raised her head at a muffledsound fromtheolderwoman, then stared at hermother-in-lawwith disbelief as it came again. A soundvery like a gigglehad slipped muffled frombehindthehand Lady Gerville had raisedto her mouth. In the next moment, the womangave up theobvious struggleshe was waging and burst into gales oflaughter.</p><p>Avelyn smiled uncertainlyandwaited forheramusementtofade.</p><p>\"Oh, Avelyn,\" Lady Gerville sighed at last. Easing down to sit beside her on the furs,she put anarm aroundAvelyn's shouldersand briefly hugged herclose. \"You poor dear, 'tisnot youIamlaughing at,'tisall of us. The last few days havebeen onecalamity afteranother. Firstthere wasyourfaintingat the wedding, then the fire, now thisdrowning that was not a drowning. \"</p><p>\"Aye. Iappear to be something ofa clumsy oaf. \"</p><p>\"You? Nay. Not you, child. Yourmother told me 'twas her ideato bind you for thegown for the wedding. Asforthefire,you may have knocked the candle over, but Paen was the one whotriedto put it outwith his hands. Wereit not for you running belowto fetchhelp, his pride probablywould have seen himexpireinthat fire. Then today, the man misconstrued the situation, mistook your floating for drowningand carted youabout like amadman. None of that was really your fault.</p><p>'Twas... well... fate, I suppose. But fate does seem to be working againstyou at the moment. \"</p><p>\"Against me?\" Avelyn glancedat herwith surprise. \"I am not the one getting injured by these incidents. Paen is. \"</p><p>\"Aye. But...\" Lady Gervillehesitated, and thenadmittedruefully, \"I spent the entire time Iwas bandaging Paen'shands listening to him fretover the possibilitythat his bride may not be what he'd hoped. That you appear fragile, unskilled and accident prone. \"</p><p>Avelyn frowned over this news. She was anything but fragile. She was also well trainedand terribly efficient... usually. Asforbeing accident prone,she didn'tused tobe. \"What do I do?\"</p><p>\"Well...\" Lady Gervillebrieflyponderedthematter. \"I suppose we could tellhim thathe wasmistaken inthinking youhaddrowned,\"she offered, sounding doubtful.</p><p>Avelyn shook her head. \"Then he would feel a fool fortrying to rescueme. Nay, I could notdo that. Awifeshould protect her husband's pride. \"</p><p>\"Aye. Well...\" Lady Gervillethought for another moment. \"I suppose you could admit that you really doknow how to ridehorses. \"</p><p>\"You knew I could?\"Avelyn asked with surprise.</p><p>\"The night of the feast, your mother was telling me of your accomplishments.</p><p>Ridingwasamong them. I knewatonce that youwere claiming an inabilityat the skill to prevent Paen's takingthe reins and damaging his hands further. \"</p><p>Avelyn nodded. \"Aye, and if I admit to that skill nowhe shall insist on taking the reins for therest of the journey,\" she mutteredunhappily. \"And he shall do them more damage. \"</p><p>\"Aye. He may do. Menaresofoolish intheir pride. \" Lady Gerville sighedagain.</p><p>\"Well, then, perhaps the only thing todoisto letthingsgo and show with your future behavior thatyou are capable. AndIshall helpby not stepping in and taking over yourduties in future,\" she assured Avelyn apologetically. \" Tis just thatI am usedtotending such things.

It was enough for her toknow thather mother-in-law wasn't deliberatelysetting outto undermine her place inher husband's life. She had no wish tonagtheolder woman should she forget and act like amother to her own son. \"I know you areembarrassed at having been seen unclothedby everyone, but when you are sufficiently recovered, come join us by the fire. Dinner should be ready soon. \" LadyGerville patted her shoulder affectionately, and then slipped from the tent.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Avelynhad just built upher courageto the pointwhereshe was willing tojoin everyone around the fire for the evening meal when there was a sudden throat-clearing outside the tent and a tentative, \"Avelyn?\"</p> <p>\"Aye?\"She glanced curiously toward the flap as it lifted and Diamanda peered in uncertainly.</p><p>\"May I comein?\" the younger girl asked.</p><p>\"Of course. \" Avelyn smiledather in welcome,her curious gaze moving to the meatthe girl held on abed of leaves.</p><p>\"Themen roasted somerabbits they snared, and whenyou did not come outto join us, I realized you must be too embarrassed after the spectacle earlier, so I thought you mightlike me to bringyou some. \"</p><p>Avelyn blinked at the meat shethrust forward,andthenlifted hergaze tothegirl's face. Diamandawaspink-cheeked withembarrassment,and Avelyn knewher own facewas sportinga blush after the girl's blurted speech. She'dbeen so embarrassed at the men seeing her, she hadn't even thought of Diamanda's and the maids' reaction. Burning humiliation now coursed through her at the thought of the undignified picture she must have made.</p> <p>Realizing that she was being rude, Avelyn forceda smile and accepted the food.</p><p>\"Thankyou, Diamanda. It wasthoughtfulof you to think ofme. \"</p><p>Diamanda smiled widely. \"I just know that I would havedied ifithad been me carriedthrough campas bare as the day I was born for everyoneto see,and I'm not evenas big asyou. \"She smiled reassuringly. \"I know yourcousinswere meanto you about it, butyou will be happier at Gerville. Paen and Lord and Lady Gerville will never make funof howyou look, like your cousinsdid. The Gervilles aresuch wonderfulpeople and accept everyone, no matter how big or ugly they are. \"</p><p>Diamanda blinked as she heard her ownwords, then saidquickly, \"Not that you are ugly. I just meant that if you were, theywould... or would not...\" Obviously confused andembarrassed at the mess she'd made of what she'dmeantto be a reassurance, Diamandacluckedand turned quickly away to open the flap. \"I should get backtothe fireere Lady Gervillewonders where I got to. \"</p><p>She wasgone before Avelyn could sayanything,thoughshe wasn'tsure what she wouldhavesaid. Part of herfelt as if she should haveagain said thank youfor the girl's thoughtfulness,but her attemptsto reassureher had managed to make Avelyn feel even worseabout herself.</p><p>Sighing dispiritedly, she settledontothemakeshift bed of furs and contemplated the meat the girlhad left. it was a full leg and smelleddelicious, but in truth, Avelyn wasn'tvery hungry. Not that she had been before Diamanda's visit. After the beating her stomach had takenon the back of the horse, the lastthing she'd beeninterested in waseating. But Avelynknew sheshouldeat. It had been a long dayin the saddle and would no doubtbe again tomorrow,and after learning that Paen was worried thatshe wasn't the strong and competentwifehe had hoped for, she was determined tokeepherstrengthup.</p> <p>Grimacing,Avelyn pickedupa bit of meat and took a small bite, managing tobite hertongue asshe did. Mutteringunderher breath, she spat the meat out and rubbed her tongue overthetop of her mouth, trying tosoothe it. She hadn't thoughtshe'd bitten down that hard,but her tongue was tingling. Shaking her headat hersuddenly clumsytendencies, she sighed and forced herself to take anotherbite of the meat, but foundno pleasurein it. Hertonguewas tingling,and herstomach began to roil themoment the first mouthful hit it. It was not pleased with the beating it hadtaken thatdayandwas infullrevolt at her daringtotry to put anything in it.</p><p>Avelyn gave upon the food after just acoupleof bitesand set it aside,then lay back on the furs. Sheclosed her eyes andtried torelax, hoping herstomach would settle given the chance,but onceshe lay quietand still, there was nothing todistract herfrom her body's complaints and Avelynwas simplymore aware ofthetingling of her tongue and her upset stomach. Shealso started tofeel abit crawly, as if ants wereracing acrossherexposedskin.</p><p>Frowning, she rubbed her hands up her arms and over her face, then sat up abruptlyas her stomach went intofull revolt. Covering her mouthwith one hand, Avelyn pushedherself toher feet and hurried out of the tent, rushing around behind itand dropping to her knees just in time for whatshe'd eaten to come catapulting out. There wasnoheaving, little warning, justa suddenviolent expulsion of the food.</p><p>Gasping for aironce she was done,Avelyn sat back onher knees and pressed onehand to her stomach, reluctant togetup until she wassure her ordeal was over.</p><p>Fortunately, shehadn't eaten much, andthemoment it wasout, herstomach mostly settled down, pleasedto be emptyagain. Itseemed she wasn't going to beeating tonight.</p><p>Avelyn ran her fingers slowly overherstomach, pressingsoftly and wincing at the tenderness there fromthe bruising ride. Atingling tongue and tendertummy - she was a mess. The fates did seem to haveit out for her atthe moment.</p><p>Shaking her head at her own fanciful thoughts, Avelyn stood cautiously and waited another momentto be sure she wouldn'tbe sick again,then made her way back around tothe front of thetent,her gazeslidingover the people around the camp-fireas she did. No one appeared to have noticed her suddenrun from the tent.</p><p>Nor did theynotice herslipping back inside, thank goodness. Thelast thing she neededwasfor her husband to know she'd thrownup. It would justreinforce his concerns regarding her hardiness.</p> <p>Thesight of the food restingbeside the bed made her grimaceand herstomach rumble threateningly, as if warning herof what it would do if she again tried to eat.</p><p>Avelyn had no intention of doing so, but neitherdid she want her husband comingto bed and seeing thatshehadn'teaten. Pickingup the meat, she movedback to the tentflap, made sure no one was looking, then slipped out around behind the tentand tossed the food into the woods.</p><p>Back inside the tent,Avelyn picked upPaen's discarded tunic. Runilda normally wouldhave picked upany clothes lying about, butAvelyn supposed she wouldn't know what to do with the scrap of cloth. it was Paen's, and goodforlittlebut arag anymore, thoughshe doubted herhusband would agree with thatsinceit was all he had to wear. He was outthere nowwithout even it tocover him. Not that it would havebeen much use in keeping himwarm, she thought, examining the holes in the item.</p><p>Turningthe cloth over in her hands, she glanced towardherchestagainst one wall of thetent. There was cloth in therethat her motherhad sent with her,cloth tomake new dressestoreplace the twothat had been destroyed onher wedding day. Surely she could make her new husband newclothes? He certainlyneeded them, and it would be something she coulddo to pleasehim.</p><p>Avelyn dropped the tunic on theend of the fur bed and movedto the chest.</p><p>Setting the candle carefullyon the floor beside it, she openedthe chest and peered in,then frowned. There werethree different colors of cloth - ared that was deeper and lovelierthan the red gown she'd lostin the fire, an ivory cloth, and ababyblue very similarto the cloththey'd usedin her wedding gown. Avelyn dropped the red andbaby blue, butset the ivoryaside and picked up ablack gown similar totheone she waswearing.</p><p>Avelyn peered from the dress to the ivorycloth, an image rising inhermind ofher husband in black braesand a white tunic. Once the image took hold, she couldn't seem to let it go. Itwouldmean tearingout the seams oftheblack gown, Of course, but there was plenty of cloth there forher to make Paen a pair of braes from it.</p><p>Besides,she alreadyhadoneblack dress. Who needed two?</p><p>Decisionmade, she moved tothebed to begin work on rippingopenthe seams of theblack gown.</p><p>Once shehadthe stitchesout, Avelyn spread the cloth of the skirt out on the furs and began to cut it. She had sewnalot of clothesfor bothher brother andher father. Byher guess, her husbandwas more herbrother'ssize than her father's, but still bigger. She cut accordingly, then beganto sew, happy to finallyfind something she could do to please her husband.</p><p>Avelyn worked until the candle beganto gutter inits wooden holder on the chest.</p><p>Frowning, she rubbed her sore eyes and glanced toward thecandlejust before it wentout. She should have been left in completedarkness,but wasn't. Gray light was filteringin throughthe open flap of the tent.</p><p>Setting the unfinishedbraes aside, she gotto her feet, groaninglow in herthroat as her body complained at the movement after sitting so long in one position.</p><p>Rubbing her aching back,Avelyn moved tothetent flap and peeredout,dismayed tofind herselfpeering outat the palegray predawn. She'd worked through thenight.</p><p>Avelyn hadbarely acknowledgedthat when she realizedthat her husband had never come to bed.</p><p>Peering outtoward the center of camp, she glanced over thedarkshapes of the sleeping men andknew that her husbandwas oneof them. Hehad sleptout on the hard earth rather than join her intheir tent.</p><p>Swallowing the lump that had suddenlylodged itself in her throat,she turnedand eyedthefurs in the cornerof the tent. She knew thatifshe lay down now, not only would she cry herself to sleep, she would just feel worse when she woke up.</p><p>Everyone else would be stirring soon, and the bit of sleep she would manage wouldn't beenough. Infact, shesuspectedit would justmakeherfeel worse.</p><p>Sighing, shemovedtothe chest instead. Avelyn shifted thedead candleasideand fetched a strip oflinenand her browndress fromthechest, then slipped out of the tent. She moved silently out ofcamp, finding and following the pathto the riverwith ease. Paen's madrampagethrough itthe nightbefore had left a trail.</p><p>Atthe water'sedge, Avelyn pausedandinhaled deeply asshe peered around. The air was fresh with early morning smells, and the woods werejustbeginning to stir. It was a quietandpeaceful time. Smilingfaintly, she slidout of her gown and madeher way intothe water.</p><p>The river water wascold, and Avelyn was quick about her bathing. She was quickerstill about drying and dressingherself in the brown dress. Shepickedup the black dress she'd slept inandstarted to make her way back tocamp whenshe spied a quail at the edge of the clearing. Avelyn paused.</p><p>Imaginingher husband's surprised pleasurewhen shepresentedhim with fresh eggs cooked in the embers of the night's fire, she dropped her black dress and moved afterthebird, following it asitwaddled along the trail. Shehadn'tgone far when she spied the nest justoff the trail. Herlips curved at thesight of the eggs nestled there. Avelynshooedthe bird away, then dropped to herkneesto get closer, uncaring thatshewastanglingher hairhorribly in thebranches and muddyingher gown. Shecould repair that later. Shewanted those eggs for her husband.</p><p>Paen rolled onto his back, grimacing atthe stiffnessin his bones. He'd never enjoyed sleepingout in the openonthe hard ground,but last night it had seemed the lesserof twoevils. His gaze slid to the tentwhere he'd beenexpected to sleep,and he scowled. After spending the evening unable to stop recalling her naked body cuddled against his,the idea of joining hispretty young wife in their nest of furshad beenappealing. Too appealing. Paen had easilybeen able to imagineher warm, soft, naked body cuddling into his in the darkness, herbottompressinginto his shaft,her breastsrestingagainst the arm he would wrap around her. Just the idea of ithad stirredhim, and the knowledge thathe wouldn't be able to doa damned thing about thatstirringhadkept him away.</p><p>Paen pushed away the fur he'd wrapped aroundhimself andshivered at the cool morning air. It reminded-him thathe was still bare-chested. Even with its holesand thestench ofsmoke thatclung to it, his ruinedtunic had affordedsome protection from theelements. But he hadn't wishedto risk slippingintothe tent tofetch the tunic, not with the memoryof Avelyn's naked breast still dancing inhis head.</p><p>Good Lord! Paen had neverconsidered himself a terriblylusty fellow. Hehad the usual urgesandhad, in the past, dealt with themas they'd arisen,but he'd neverbeen one to wallowin carnal pursuits. But withhis wife'simage burned onhis brain as it was,he was temptedto wallow. He'd liketo run his handsand lips over every part of her soft,rounded body and - Killing his thoughts there, Paen gave upany idea of fetching his tunic untilhe'd hada nicecold dip in theriver. A nicelong cold dip. Really long.</p><p>Sighing, Paen stumbled sleepily across camp to thetrail leading to theriver. An energizing dipwas just thething, he assuredhimself,and rubbedsleepily athis face, trying to wake himselfupas he moved alongthe trail.</p><p>Paen wasn'tgood inthe morning. He usually needed a good head-soaking to thoroughly wakeup.</p><p>Stifling a yawn with one hand, Paen tried to planhis morning. He needed to drain thedragon and take a dipinthe river, thenstart waking the othersup toget under way. Hehoped to reach Hargrove today to greet his new squire. The boy was Hargrove's son. The manhad approached him abouttaking theboyon whenhe'd heard thatPaen's last lad had been lost, but not untilheknew thatPaen was giving upthe battletrail.</p><p>Paen'seyesaliton a berry bush, and his feet slowed as heapproachedit. The berries werefull and ripeand juicy-looking,and heimmediately felt his mouth water in anticipationof eating them. Paen was more ofa meat,cheeseand bread man, but his refusal to allowanyone tohelp him eat meant it had beentoolong sincehehad eaten properly. Fasting wasn't sobad. Hehad done itbefore, andit wasn'treally affecting him after onlyone day. Fortunately, he wasableto hold a goblet between his two bandagedhands sowas still able to drink,but he washungry enough that in that moment,theberrieslooked as goodto him as wholelegsof lamb roastedand hung from the branches.</p><p>Pausing beside the bush ofberries, Paen glanced backthe way he'd come. No onewas followinghimdown the trail. Licking his lips, he turned his attention backto the fruit, then slid to hiskneesbefore the bushand leaned forward tocatch one ripe berry between his lips. Paen tuggeditfromthe bush, almostmoaning as the fruit burst in his mouth,sprayingits sweetnessover his tongue and the top ofhis mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasataste of heaven, thefinestnectar, and he was leaning forward to catch another beforehehad even swallowedthat one. Paenknelt there for quite awhile, gobbling upthe berriesone afterthe other like a bee sucking the nectar from a flower... until he heard acracklingin the bushes to hisright.</p><p>Pausing, he peered along the trail in that direction, his eyesnarrowing. There was nothing tosee,but Paen could still hear somethingmoving about inthe brambles, something large. Some sortof animal? He briefly forgot about theberries ashe spied a bird through the branches. Itsstockybody andbrown and buff coloring made it recognizable as aquailbefore it slid back intothe bramblesandout of sight.</p><p>Still on hisknees,Paen startedtofollowwithsome ideaof catchingtheanimal for a meallaterin the day, or perhaps following it to its nesttosee ifthere were any eggs there. It mightbe nice to wake his wife with ahot mealtobreak her fast with.</p> <p>He moved slowly and quietly on his knees, following the sound of breaking branches now. Whenhe spied a flashofbrownthrough the branches ahead, he judgedhimself closeenoughto catch the bird andlunged forward, bandaged hands outstretchedin the hopesthat hecould capture it between the cloth stubs. As it turned out,however,his target was muchbigger than he expected. This became clear as he fell through the branches that had been barring his view. Bythen it was too late - he was already landing on someone's back and derrierecovered in a long brown wool skirt.</p><p>Paen grunted attheimpactas thebody collapsedbeneathhisweight,the sound almostdrowning outthe surprised squeal of the womanhe'd landed on. He rolled offof her at once, and she thrashed away from himbefore rollingonto her sideto gapeat him.</p><p>\"Husband?\" She staredat him with amazement.</p><p>\"Wife. \" Paen stared atAvelynin bemusement, trying to reason what she was doing there. Then he noted her damp hair and his eyes narrowed. \"You were swimming. \"</p><p>Avelyn blinked, then noddedslowly. \"Aye. I bathedin the river. \"</p> <p>\"After nearly drowning yesterday, you thought you should go swimming this morning by yourself?\" Paen glared, furious that shehad riskedherself thatwaywhen he hadnearly lost hertheday before. Where was her sense? Howhad heendedup married to awoman so beautiful, but so dense?It wasbadenough that she was weak and frail and untutored, but how disheartening it was to find she was completely senselessas well.</p><p>\"I___\"</p><p>\"Avelyn,\" he interrupted sharply. \"You could have drowned again, andthistime I would nothave been there to save you. \"He struggled to his feet in the bushes,then reached down, waiteduntilshe caughthis wrist,thentugged her to her feet.</p><p>\"Idid not drown - \"</p><p>\"Nay, and Iam grateful for that,\" he interrupted again. \"But sinceGod did not see fittobless youwithcommon sense to match your beauty, in future youwill nevergo anywhere or do anythingwithout asking my permission first,\"he ordered grimly, thenfrowned even harder when henoted the state of the front ofher dress. The skirt was mud-covered, but the upper torso of the gown was covered with a slimy mixture that was yellowishin spots and clear in others. Her face and neck also carriedthe shiny goop. \"What thedevil is thatall over your face and down the front of yourdress?</p><p>\"Quail eggs,\" she admittedon a sigh. \"Ispotted aquail asI was about toreturn from theriver and thought youmight like a treat. I was collecting the eggs when you leaptonme. \"</p> <p>Some of Paen's angerfaded at her explanation. Whether it was because she'dhad the same thought asheand hadhoped topresent him with the same tasty gift, or because he was responsible for the messnow coating her front, he couldn't say, but most of his anger slid out of him on along sighandhe swallowed the rest of itas he noted the disheartenedexpression on her face.</p><p>\"Eggswouldhavebeen nice. I thoughtof themmyself when I saw the quail, 'tis how I ended launching myself upon you. Now come,\" he saidgruffly, offering his hand before herecalled the stubs they presently were.</p><p>Avelyn simplyplaced her hand on his arm and ignored his hand.</p><p>Grateful that shedid not make abig deal of his temporaryhandicap, Paenledher out ontothe trail and down to the river's edge. He waited patiently as shewaded into thewater, thenscooped uphandfuls of silt and small pebbles and used it to scour the egg off her face, neck and the front ofher gown. Paen hadratherhoped that she might strip and bathe again, butsupposed the dress would be harder to cleanif the eggs were left to dry before washing.</p><p>Hisdisappointmentsoon gave way tointerest,though, when Paen noted the way thedampgown clung to her curves. He found himself moving closer to the river's edge as he watched herbendand scoopthe water up, and thennoted theway it cascadeddownthebrown cloth that envelopedher like a second skin. Paen found himselfwishing she was in thered dress she'd worn to their wedding celebration.</p><p>Thatgown hadbeen a silky cloth, the colorbrighter andmore flatteringto herthan the dull brown. He wasn't complaining, however. Brown or red, the cloth was clinging lovingly and giving him thoughts ofjoining herin the water and stripping the cloth away, or running his hands everywhere it now clung.</p><p>Despite the thickness ofthewool,Paen was sure he could seethe outline ofher nippleswhere thewater had made them erect. Hewanted topeel thedamp cloth away and replace it with his mouth. Hewantedto catch the nubs between his lips andflick his tongue over - \"God'stoes!\"</p><p>\"My lord husband?\"</p> <p>Avelyn turnedto him in surprise at the curse, and Paen immediately stumbled forwardtojoinherin the water.</p><p>\"Husband! What - ?\"</p><p>\"I got some egg on myself as well,\" Paen lied abruptly. The truth was, his wayward thoughts had encourageda certain part of his anatomy to awaken and stretch with interest. Paenhad glanceddownin mid-thought tofind himself sporting an erection... and unable to do anything about it.</p><p>Hecouldhardlyadmit thatto her, soPaen had plunged into the water upto his waist to hide his sorry stateandlied about the reason for it. Thegood news was, the cold water had takencare of the erectionalmost at once; the bad news was, he was urgently reminded thathe'd originally headed down hereto relieve himself and he was nomore capable ofmanaging the task of undoing his pantsthan he hadbeen before, and he'd be damned ifhe'dask hiswife'shelpin the matter.</p><p>\"Come,we'reclean enough,\" he said shortly, thenturned and stomped out of the water. He turned his back and waited impatiently as she changed from the now soaked gowninto theblack one he'd notedlyingonthe ground when they'd entered.</p><p>The momentAvelyn was finisheddressing, Paen hurriedher back tocamp. He left herattheirtent and moved off to find hisfather to helphim see to his own ablutions. It was always anembarrassing chore, and he was glad when it was quickly finished. Paen could not wait untilhecould remove his damned bandages, but his mother had suggestedit would beat leasttwo weeksbefore he was healed enoughto go without them. Paen already knew those two weeks would bethe most miserable of his life.</p><p>Sighing over that sad fact, he led his fatherback into camp, frowning when he saw the half-collapsed tent and the two men moving into the woods behind it. Paen calledout to them and walked over to see what wasgoing on.</p><p>\"One of the tent pegs was stuck prettytight intotheground. It flew outof Hob's handand overhis shoulder whenhe did manage to pull itout,\" Paen was told.</p><p>\"Neither of us saw whereit went, so weare havingtolook for it. \"</p><p>Paen shifted with irritation at theholdup. \"Get back to takingdown the tent. I shall look for thepeg-\"</p><p>Whenthe man's gaze dropped dubiously toPaen's bandaged hands, he felt his mouth tighten. \"I willcall whenIsee it and one of you can come get it. Just get the tentdown. You canhelpme look when you are finished. \"</p><p>Shrugging, the two menreturnedto breakingdown the tent, and Paen turnedto stepinto the woods. He had noideahow farthepeg could have flown, orin which direction, and he wouldn't be abletopick up thedamnedthing, but hedid have eyes andthey, at least, were working.</p><p>Paen had been scouring the forest floor for several minutes when he nearly stumbled over a dead fox. He peered down at the poor animalwith pity,then noted the gnawed rabbit leg inches fromitsmouth andknelt to examine the scene more closely. The rabbit leg wasonly lightlygnawed,leaving itobvious that the meathad been roasted. Since he doubted that foxes had taken to roasting theirrabbits, Paen could only assume that the poor sick creature had stumbled across someone's leavingsand managed a couple of bites before expiring, or that someone was deliberately setting out poisoned meat to kill the creatures.</p><p>A shout fromsomewhere to his left made himraise his head. One of themen announced they'dfound the tent peg. Apparently, the men had finished taking down thetent and had joined him in the woods. Now that the tentwasdown and thepeg found, they could leave. Another day's journey meant another day closer to Hargrove and hisnew squire.</p><p>Forgetting about the fox, Paen straightenedand had takenseveral stepswhen he set his foot down in somethingsquishy andnearly lost his footing. Glancingdown, hesawthat someonehad been sickin the woods. Grimacing, he wiped hisboot through the grass forseveralstepstoremovethe muck as hehurried back to camp.</p><p>Paen prayedevery step ofthe way thathismorningso farwasnot an omen of things to come. He wasreallyhopingthattodaywouldgo better than the day before - actually,better than the last two days had gone, Paen thought. Things hadn't proceededwell since he'd arrived at Straughton. Hesupposed the wedding had gone well enoughuntil his bride had fainted, but everything since thenhad beennothing but one calamity after theother. Paen was starting to think he was cursed.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Avelyn talked nonstopthroughout the last hour oftheday's ride. As she had the day before, she'dtaken herplace before her husband on hismount and taken the reins so hecouldcontinue \"teachingher how to ridea horse. \"Paen hadn't thought sheneededany moreinstruction, but Avelyn had insisted she wasanxious about handling her own horse and he'drelented and agreed to continuethe lessons for anotherday.</p><p>Unfortunately, about half an hour into the journey, her all-nightsewing session, combined with therhythmicsway ofthe horse, hadconspired to lull her tosleep.</p><p>Paenhad apparentlytaken the reinsfromher slack hands, somehow managedto shift her to nestleagainsthis chest without waking her,andlet her sleep.</p><p>She'd wokenwell into the afternoon, dismayedto realize she'd sleptfor so long.</p><p>Determinedto remain awake forthe rest of the day, Avelyn hadbegun tochatter, saying anything that popped into her head. She had managedto stay awake... but thenit wasonly an hour later that Paen had decided to stop thehorses for thenight.</p><p>While Avelyn wasupset that her husband would nodoubt seeher nap asanother sign ofherweakness, she herself saw itas afailure of monumental proportions. Her job aswife wasto protectand nurture herhusband. She'd failedby letting him take the reins while she slept. Avelyn could only hope it hadn't further damaged his hands. She vowed to set the sewingaside early andsleep that night so that she would be bright-eyed and ready to handle hishorse tomorrow.</p><p>Avelynfeared it would be a difficulttask. After sleeping all day, she was now wide awake and impatient to do something. Unfortunately,her husband had other ideas.</p><p>Avelynwatched unhappilyas the others bustled about,settingup camp. She'd wanted to help, but Paen had ordered her tosit andwouldbrook noargument. She hadn't mindedat first while Lady Gerville sat with her,but once the tents were up, hernew mother-in-law had disappeared inside her own tent to help arrange the interior. When Avelynhadtried todo the same, Paen had repeated his orderforher tosit and had sent Runilda in to takecareof thematter.</p><p>Asifdrawnby her thoughts, her husband suddenlyappeared beforeher. Avelyn managed to smile ingreeting.</p><p>\"Your maid is done setting up thetent,\" he an-nounced. \"I want youto gorest untilthe meal is cooked. \"</p><p>\"But - \"</p><p>\"Now,\" Paeninsisted.</p><p>Avelyn hesitated a moment, then gavein with a sigh and stood. Havingslept through whatever mealtherest of them had managed in the saddle at noon, she was starved. She also needed to relieveherself, but her husband didn't appear in the moodto hear either comment. Deciding she could waiton both counts, Avelyn made her waytothe tent.</p><p>\"I have made thebed ifyou wouldliketo rest, milady,\" Runilda greeted as she entered the tent.</p><p>\"Isleptall day, Ru. I amnot tired,\"Avelyn saiddryly.</p><p>\"Aye. Iknowyou slept through the day. Lord Paenwasvery concerned about you. Are you notfeeling well,milady ?\"</p><p>\"I am fine, I just stayed up allnight sewing. Idid notmean to,\" she addedwhen Runilda lookedsurprised. \"Iintended to put it aside whenmy husbandretired, but he never came to bed, and thenextthing Iknewit wasdawn. \"</p><p>\"Well...\"Thegirl seemed at aloss, thenoffered, \"I amsure he will be pleased whenhe sees the new clothes. \"</p><p>\"Aye. \" Avelyncheeredslightly at the thought. Surely hewouldappreciate having properclothing? And presenting them tohim would allow her the chance to explain awayher exhaustion and perhapspersuade him she wasn'tas fragile as he thought.</p><p>Theidea madeher decide toget to workon the clothes againright away and she movedtothe chest to dig the project out.</p><p>\"You sleptthrough the day and missed the cheeseand bread LadyGervillehad passed out at noontime as we rode. I'm surethereissomeleft. ShallI fetch you something to eat?\"</p><p>\"Aye, please, Runilda. I would appreciate that,\" Avelyn murmured,closing the chest and moving to the bed with the braes she'd started the night before. She should have them done in an houror so, shethought, thencouldat least starton the tunic eresleeping. Byher estimate, she could haveboth done in smother night or two.</p><p>Avelyn was working diligently away when Runilda returned. The maid had managed to find cheese, bread and apple. Sheset them all beside Avelyn andasked something aboutthe goods in thecart,then asked if shecould go helpSelywith something orother. Only half hearing her,Avelyn nodded and wavedher off,then continued towork, pausingevery fewminutesto take a bitefrom thefood thegirl had brought her. She was still working when Diamanda came some hours later, bearing agoblet ofstew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Stew?\" Avelynaskedwithsurpriseas she accepted the goblet.</p><p>\"Aunt Helen used thebig black pot your mothersentwith you from Straughton. \"</p><p>She looked uncertain. \"She didask Runildatoask you if itwould be all right. \"</p> <p>\"Oh, aye,\" Avelyn murmured,recalling the maid chattering away atherwhenshe'd brought the food earlier.</p><p>\"Aunt Helen thought itwould make it easierfor Paentoeat if hecoulddrinkit out of thegoblet. \"</p><p>Avelyn nodded slowly, wishing she'd come up with the idea herself. It hadn't occurred to her to wonder how Paen was managing to eat. She was a most thoughtless wife.</p><p>\"Runilda was supposed to ask if she might borrow the goblets as well,\"</p><p>Diamanda said when Avelyn was silentso long. She immediately nodded.</p> <p>\"Of course,that is fine. \" Her motherhad sent sixgoblets with her. All hadbeen speciallymadeand bore her and Paen's initials. There were a lot more than six people in their party, though. \"Whatis everyone else eating out of?\"</p><p>\"The men are eating roastrabbitagain. Aunt Helenonly made enough stew for the family because there would not be enough goblets for everyone,\" Diamanda explained. \"Anyway, Paen suggested I bring you some so that youwould notneed trouble yourself to comeout of the tent and couldcontinuetorest. You were terribly tired today. \"</p><p>\"Idid not sleep much last night,\" Avelyn said vaguely in response tothequestion onthe youngergirl'sface.</p><p>\"Will you be all right fortraveling tomorrow?\"Diamanda queried. \"I only ask because Paen is frettingthatyou aresickening and - \"</p><p>\"I shallbefine. I amfine. I just did not sleep much, sowasweary today. I will sleep tonight. \"</p><p>Diamanda didn't look as if she believed her, but nodded politely, thenturned a curiousgaze on the black clothin her lap. \"What are you sewing?\"</p> <p>Avelyn glanceddownand smiled. \"Ithought to makesome braesand a tunic for Paen. Hisare in suchadisreputable statefromthe fire. Tis why Iwas so weary today. My stomach wasa tad upset and I couldnot sleep, soIstartedon these. The next thing I knew, it was morning,\" she explained and held thebraes up for herto see. \"Do you thinkhe willlike them?\"</p><p>\"Oh. \" Diamanda's eyeswidenedand shereachedout to touch the cloth. \"He will lovethem. \"</p><p>Avelyn smiled with reliefandlet themsettleback in her lap. \"I hope to have them ready inanothernight or two. \"</p><p>\"Well, do not make yourself blindworkingon them. Youshould haveanother candle in here. \"</p><p>Avelyn glanced towardthecandle onthe chest. She had avague recollection of Runilda entering at somepointand settingthe lit candlethere,but wasn't sure how long ago it had been.</p><p>\"The one will befine,\" Avelyn said, smiling at thegirl'sconcern.</p><p>\"Well, at leastset it abit closerso that you do notstrain youreyes. \" Diamanda moved to collect the candle as shespoke andset it on thegroundnext tothe furs.</p><p>\"There - that is better. Well...\" She straightened andbeamed asmile at Avelyn. \"I should go eat my stew. I shall comebackwhen I have finished andcollect your gobletto clean withmine,\" she announced,then added firmly, \"And I shall expect you to haveeaten everylast drop. \"</p> <p>Avelyn watched the girlslipout ofthe tent,a smallsmile playing about herlips.</p><p>Despite her occasionalverbalblunders,Diamanda seemedto be a charming young woman, and she appreciated her efforts to befriend her. Avelyn's gaze droppedto thestewand shegaveit a sniff. It did smell delicious, butshewasn't reallyhungry after the fare Runildahad brought her. She didn't wish to offend hermother-in-law, or hurt Diamanda's feelings by not at least appearing to haveeaten it when thegirl returned for thegoblet.</p><p>Avelyn's gazeslidto the tent flap. It hadn't closedall the way, andshe could see thepeoplegathered around the fire inthecenter of the campsite. Setting hersewing aside, she picked up the goblet and stood. Paen had never approached her about tending to personalmatters, and whileshe knewhe hadinsistedthat sheask his permissionbefore going anywhereon herown,surely he didn't include tendingto matters such as finding a handy bush. It would certainly be embarrassing to approach him by the fire to request anescort intothe woods.</p><p>Avelynrecalledthe day before and how uncomfortable it had beenhavinghim stand only feet away - within hearing distance - as she'd wateredthe bushes. No, she decided, he couldn't have meant to include this task in hisorders. Besides,what he didn't know wouldn'thurthim, and she could surely managewithout comingto any harm.</p><p>Mind madeup, Avelyntookthegobletof stew with her and slidout of the tent, then quickly around behind it. it was dark here away from the campfire, and she hadn't a clue where the path to the river would be since her husbandhadn'tseenfit to take her there, but she moved into the woods, pushing her way through the clawing branches untilshe feltshe was agood enough distancefrom the tent. Then she turnedthegobletover andgave it agood shake to make sure allthe stew was out, then setthe goblet down whileshe tended to her needs.</p><p>Avelyn caughtthe hemof her skirt on both sides and lifted it up over her hips as shedropped to squat in thebushes, thengave a startledlittle squeal of painand straightened abruptly, one hand goingtorub her bottom. Stingingnettles - leave itto hertosquat in apatch of them.</p><p>Grimacing,she movedseveral feet fromwhere she'd been, felt cautiously around with herhand to be sure there wereno nettles here, then repeatedthe procedure.</p><p>This time shemanaged the task without incident.</p><p>Relieved tohave thematter tendedto, she started back toward the tent, then paused. She'dforgottenthe goblet. Staring into the darkness around her, Avelyn considered returning for it inthe morning, but feared she wouldn't know where exactly to look. Ontop of that, Diamanda was going toreturn for it to clean. How couldshe explain losing the goblet? The girl would know she hadn'teatenthestew, andherfeelings wouldbe hurt.</p><p>Heaving a resigned breath, Avelyn moved to where she thought she'd first stopped, and knelt to feel around for it. Of course, she found the stew first.</p><p>Muttering under her breath, she wiped her hand on the grass, then continued searching,andthis time foundthe stinging nettles.</p><p>It justwas not her night, Avelyn thought with exasperation, rubbing the tips of the injured fingers with her other hand, then tried one more time. Fortunately,she found the goblet without furtherincident and stood up with relief.</p><p>There,thatwasn't so bad, she toldherself silendy as she madeher way backto the tent,but evenshedidn't believe it. Avelyn pausedbehind thetent and peeked around first to be sure noone waslooking, then hurriedquickly aroundto the flap andslipped inside with asigh ofrelief.</p><p>She setthe goblet on the ground by the furs, picked upher sewing and winced at the irritated sting in her fingers. Sheswitched thesewing to her other hand. The moment she putweight on her bottom, she was remindedthat her fingers weren't the only thing that had comein contact with the nettles.</p><p>Gasping,Avelynshifted to herknees, then dropped thesewing altogether and lifted the back of her skirtin aneffort to see howmuch damagethe nettleshad done.</p><p>Of course, no matter how she strained and twisted, she couldn't see much.</p><p>However, when she ran her uninjuredhand over the area, shecould feel welts.</p><p>Avelyn letherskirt drop back into place with a disheartenedsigh. It didseemher husbandmight be rightabouther wandering off onher own. Her behind stung from squattingin the nettles, the fingersof her right handtoo, and she'd apparently knelt in the stew. Shepluckedoff the bit of meat stucktothe knee of her gown.</p><p>Avelyndropped themeat inthe goblet, set thesewing out of the way and lay downon her side. Itwouldtakean hour or so at least beforethe welts wentaway.</p><p>Sewing was out of the question for now.</p><p>She supposedit wasforthebest. She'd determined to sleep tonightanyway. She would just get more than she'd hoped for, Avelyn told herself. Still, she was depressed by her own ineptitude.</p><p>\"Well?\"Paen asked themoment Diamandareturned from the tent.</p><p>\"She is asleep,\" the girl said apologetically. \"Iwas not sure,shall I wake her,or - ?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Paen said on a sigh. He'd asked Diamanda to invite Avelyn out to join them if she was feelingbetter, but it seemedthat wasn'tgoingto happen. Heshook his headandpushed alogfurther into the fire with the toe of his boot.</p><p>\"Did she eat anything?\"he heardhis mother ask and glanced up asDiamandaheld upthe goblet she'd fetched while there.</p><p>\"Aye, all but one little piece of meat. \"</p><p>\"Well, Iam sure she is just a little weary from the journey,\" his mother said.</p><p>Paen grunted. \"She slept through thejourney today, and she is sleeping again now,\" hepointed out grimly. \"I think sheis ailing. \"</p><p>\"Iam sure she isfine, Paen,\" hismother insisted, but he wasn't fooled. He could see theconcern on her face. Still, he let the matter drop; at leastoutwardly. Paen couldn't help but think that he had themostfragileof wivesand he would haveto take special care withher to be sure he gother homesafely. Oncethere, away from the rigors oftravel, perhaps shewould dobetter.</p><p>Theyshould reachHargrove's lateonthe morrow,where he could collect his new squire. It was only atwo-dayjourney back after that. It was reallyonly a two-day journeyfrom Straughtonto hisfamily's home, but the need to collect his squirehad taken them out of their way. He'd suggested thathismother and father continueon home with most ofthemen, leaving only a small escort for himand Avelyn,but his mother wouldn'thear of it. She wantedto be closeby tochange his bandagesand assureherself that hedidn't further hurt himself.</p><p>His gaze slidtothetent, and he decided he would keep Avelyn on his horsewith him for the remainder of the journey. That way, she could rest and conserve whatever strength she did have.</p><p>Birdsong made Avelynstraightenfrom her sewing and glancetoward the tent flap tosee that dawn wasbreaking. She'dworked through the night again.</p><p>Her nap after the encounter with the stinging nettleshad beena shortone, but it had been long enough that her backside had recovered. She'd found that after sleeping allday, she wasn't tired. Avelynhad settledinto sewing, tellingherselfthat she would only work for a little while, then would sleep. Of course, she hadn't. The sewinghadgone sowell, she'd workedthrough the night again.</p><p>She knewshe would regret it later today,but at the moment,Avelyn was terribly pleasedwith herself. She'd finished the braes and had made a goodstart on the tunic. Another nightandshe mighteven have itdone.</p><p>Imagining her husband's pleasure when she presented them to him, Avelyn straightenedher back from the hunchedpositionshe'd been working in,then got slowly and painfully to her feet. She should have moved around some toprevent the stiffness fromsetting in,but she hadn't thought about it at thetime. Now she was paying the price for sitting in one position for hours.</p><p>She folded the unfinished tunicneatlyandput it in her chestwith the braes,telling herself she didn't mind that her husbandhad again neglectedto joinher in the tent.</p><p>Avelyn wasn't a very convincing liar, eventoherself.</p><p>Marriedlife seemed to be a lot lonelier than she'd imagined it would be. Or perhapsit wasjust her marriage.</p><p>Sighing, she moved tothe tent flap topeer hopefully out. Now thatshewasup and about, Avelyn was aware of a rather urgent need to relieve herself again.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the lumps of male flesh around the fire were moving or showing any sign of waking up yet.</p><p>Glancing toward the surrounding woods, Avelynthought she spotted a pathon the opposite side of camp. Itprobably led to the river, she realized, then glanced again at thebodies asleep around the fire's ashes.</p><p>She'dencountereda bit ofdifficultyon her errand last night, but thathad been in darkness and Avelynwas sure shecouldmanage fine now that therewas more light.</p><p>But her husband had ordered her not to wander offagain without his permission.</p><p>Avelyn started to consider the repercussions of disobeyingher new husband, but herbodywas making itsneeds painfully clear. If she didn't go outand attendto the matter,she would beattendingtoit inthe tent,like itor not.</p><p>Muttering under her breath, she stepped out of the tent and moved stealthily around camp till she founda path.</p><p>She walked the path for several moments until it opened into another small clearing. She gazed around then, a bitbefuddled. There was no river in sight. Still, shecould seethe beginnings of anotherpath directly across from her. Shrugging, she crossedthe clearing and starteddown thenew path, but itseemed to grow smaller as shewentalong until it dwindledout altogether.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Avelyn gavein toneed and relieved herself, then turnedback theway she'd come.</p><p>At the small clearing she'd just crossed, Avelyn paused. There were the beginnings of two paths across fromher and Avelynwasn't sure which she'd used.</p><p>The oneon the right?The paths were rather closetogether,and it could havebeen theone on the left. Decidingto go with herfirst instinct, she started upthe pathon theright,assuring herself that if it was the wrong one,she'd simplyturn back afew minutes later, andtake theother one. However, when Avelyn did turn back, she seemed to walk an awfully long time before findinga clearing,and then it seemed smaller than theclearing she'd started out from.</p><p>Decidingshe was imagining things, Avelyn took a new path and headed out again... and ten minutes later admitted to herself that she was lost. Worse yet, considering that the sun was nowfully up in the sky, there was no wayshe could slip back into the tent without her husband noticing.</p><p>Avelyn feltready tosit right down and have a good cry. It was almost asif the fatesweretellingherthatthis marriage was doomed. However, it washer considered opinion that the fateswere a stupid bunch ifthey didn'tknow enough to giveher these warnings before she'd married rather than after.</p><p>Forcing away unwanted tears, Avelyntook a deep breath, peered around the clearing and then chose apath at random and startedout once more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She'd walked perhaps a hundred feet when she nearly knocked someone over.</p><p>Herrelief at finding somebody lastedaboutas longas it took for her to realize who she'dnearly knockedover andwhat he'd been doing at the time. The manpresently cursingat the interruption was LordGerville. Her father-in-lawhad obviously come out to tend to the samematter asshe, and hadmorethan just the situation inhand at the moment.</p><p>\"Oh!\" Avelyn whirled away from him. She even started back along the path, desperate togive him privacy. However, she hadn't gonefar when she realized he was her only hope of returningtocamp before the day wasout. Avelyn paused.</p> <p>Shedid wonder ifshe shouldn't explain whyshe wasn'tcontinuing forwardto give him more privacy, but before shecould decide what to say, hefinished his business and stomped up next to her.</p><p>\"Sorry if I gave you a start, girl,\" he said gruffly. \"Ithought Iwasthe onlyone awake orI would have gone furtherfrom camp to tendtomatters. \"</p><p>Since she'd beenwalkingfor a good halfhour, Avelyn couldn't imagine how much farther fromcamp he could have gone. However, she didn't say as much, but merely offered him a smile and hoped theshadows cast bythetrees were hiding just how red and embarrassed she was.</p><p>\"Ismyhusbandnot yetup?\"she asked hopefullyas she fell into step with him.</p><p>\"He was still asleep whenI left camp,but...\" Hepaused as theyboth became aware of the sound of someonecrashing quicklythrough the woods. Shaking his head, Lord Gerville finished, \"ButI would guess that is him coming now. \"</p> <p>\"Avelyn!\" Paen stumbled out onthepath directly aheadof themand cameto an abrupt halt.</p><p>\"There you are! I feared you had got yourselflostin the woods. Did I nottell you not to wanderoff by yourself?\"</p><p>\"I - \" Avelynbegan, but snapped her mouth closed as heused one stump to urge her backinthe direction he'd come. They'd barely taken adozensteps whenthey brokeout of the trees and into the clearing.</p><p>\"Why,Iwasn't far from campat all,\" she said with amazement as the sounds of talk and activity washed overher.</p><p>\"You were lost,\"Paen accused, and Avelyn grimaced. She really needed to think before she spoke.</p><p>\"Perhaps a little, yes,\" sheadmitted. \"But then Ifound your father, and everything was fine. Besides, I did not go to the riverside, I merelywished to attend to... er... other things,\" she finished vaguely, thenadded, \"Rather urgent other things which you did not take me to attend to yestereve when we stopped forthe night. \"</p> <p>\"You did not ask me totake youto attend tothese personal needs,\" Paen said shortly, soundingannoyed ather tone of voice. \"And I know you did not goto the riverside. Weare notcampedneara river today. \"</p><p>\"Wearen't?\" Avelyn asked with surprise. \"Then how shall we clean up today?\"</p><p>\"We won't,\" heansweredbluntly. \"But hopefully, weshallarriveatHargroveby evening and may cleanupthere. \"</p><p>\"Oh. \" She frowned over that. Shetrulydidn't care forthe gritty, dusty feelthat travelingcaused and hadlooked foward to bathinginthe river. Onthe other hand, she supposedafter yesterday's debacleit mightbe safertobathe at Hargrove.</p><p>Sighing,Avelyn turned away andstarted toward her tent, only tobe drawnup short by her husband's stump on her shoulder.</p><p>\"Wife?\"</p><p>\"Aye?\"she asked warily,turningback to face him.</p><p>\"If you need to drain the... er... use the garderobe,\" Paen corrected himself quickly,\"in future you need onlyask me. I cannotread yourmind on such matters. \"</p> <p>\"Oh. \" She blinked as his words sankin. He couldn't read hermind. Of course he couldn't, yet she'd expected him to somehow know that she needed to relieve herself. While she'd been thinking he mustrealizeshe would haveneed toattendto thematter, hehad probably been thinking she wouldmention it if she did. Sighing, she nodded, \"Aye, husband. \"</p><p>Paen nodded, apparently satisfied, then turned and hesitated in front of hisfather.</p><p>\"I am goingfor awalk in thewoods. \"</p><p>Avelyn was justfrowning over the slightly strained voice heused to make the announcement, when his father used the sametone to say,\"I shall join you, son. \"</p><p>She watched them walk away, then shook herhead with bewilderment andturned to makeher way to the tentto start packing. Her husband wouldwish to leave as soonas everyone had broken their fast. Besides, it would help her to stayawake.</p><p>Avelyn was already startingtofeel tired. The day aheadwas going to be a long one, but she thought if she keptup a line ofchatterwith her husband,the ridewould be less boring and shecould perhaps stay awake.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\"My lady. \"</p><p>Avelyn glanced up and smiled at the slender, dark-haired boy rushing across camp toward her. David Hargrove,Paen's new squire, wastenyears old,but tall for his age. He was alsovery slimand hadthe face of an angel. Thelad would break hearts when he was older.</p><p>As he rushedtoward her, David stumbledover a rock andcrashedto the ground.</p><p>Avelyn had toforce herselfnot to leap toher feet and run to seeifhe was all right.</p><p>Paenwas watching from the other side of camp, shaking his head at the child's clumsiness, and she knew he wouldn't approve of her hurrying to the boy. She'd learnedthat the day beforewhen they'd arrivedatHargroveto collectthe ladand he'd tumbled down the stairs to land in a heap at their feet. Avelyn had started forward to help the boy then, butPaen had raisedone arm beforeher toholdher back, then shook his head when she peeredat him.</p><p>Ashe hadthen, Davidquicklyscrambled back to his feet and continued on as if nothinghadhappened. Hisgrin was backin place by the time he stopped before her.</p><p>\"His Lordshipsaysyou cango toprepare thetent forthe night, my lady. The menhave it up, and the chests and furs are inside. \"</p><p>\"Thank you, David,\" Avelyn murmured,unable to resist returning his grin.</p><p>Nodding, he turned to hurry back to Paen's side, then paused suddenly and whirled backas Avelyn got to her feet. \"Oh, and he said he would take youdownto theriver towashup once he isfinishedoverseeing...overseeing...er... whenhe is done whatever he is doing,\" the boy finished, obviously having forgotten what exactly his lord had said.</p><p>\"Thank you, David,\" Avelyn repeated.</p><p>The boy nodded and turned away, managing to make itall thewayback to Paen's side without fallingagain.</p><p>Shaking her head, Avelyn continued on tothetent. The lad was enthusiasticand cheerful, and clumsy ascouldbe, but Avelyn suspected the clumsiness was simply due to nervousness. Once hesettledin, she wassure muchof his awkwardness would vanish.</p><p>There wasn't reallymuch todo inside the tent. Themen had piledthe furs in the corner as usual, and Runilda was putting linens and another fur on as Avelyn entered. That was pretty much allthere was to arrangingthe tent,other than to set the candle on the chest in preparation of lighting it when the last of the sunlight disappeared.</p><p>Thanking Runilda for herefforts, Avelyn nodded when her maid asked if she might gohelp Sely. The maids werebecomingfriends. Once alone, Avelynmoved to the chest to retrieve the tunic and braesshe was making for Paen. Avelynwasn't sure how long Paen would be, but she was so close to finishing the tunic, she couldn't resist getting in even a few moments' work on it. First she wanted to recheck the seams on thebraes and besuretheywereperfect.</p><p>Avelyn would have finished the tunic the night before except that Paen had surprised herby joining her in bed at Hargrove. Actually,if she were to be honest with herself, she probably wouldn't have gotten it finished last night. She'd been struggling to stay awake andsew whenher husbandhad entered theroom. Staying up all night, then forcing herself to remain awake all day in thesaddle had lefther feeling limp and exhausted by thetimethey'd arrived atHargrove to collectDavid.</p><p>They'd arrived atHargrove just after the eveningmeal, were welcomedwarmlyby Lord and Lady Hargroveand were served a quick meal while theirrooms and baths wereprepared for them. Avelyn had been soexhausted by then,she had nearlyfallen asleepin herfood. Once finished eating, she'dbeen gratefulto escapeabovestairs tobathe.</p><p>Avelyn didn't think she'd ever before enjoyed a bath thatmuch. She'd soaked in thescented water for muchlongerthan shenormally would have, blissfully washing away the grimeof two days' travel. Afterward, she'd dried her hairby the fire before settling in the comfortable bed with her sewing. She'd found herself nodding over the work,her eyes continually blinking closed and trying tostaythat way. It was almost a relief when Paen had entered the room ten minutes later with his squire on his heels.</p><p>Theboy hadsmiled at her, but Paen hadmerely grunted something of a greeting in her general direction, then walked to the tub wherethe boy helped him undress.</p><p>Avelyn hadgaped at his muscular, naked back until he'd settled into the tub.</p><p>Finally able to think again once mostof that nude flesh had beenhiddenby the sides of the tub, she'd balledup her sewing andtuckedit under the bed. She'd lain down andpulled the linens up, planning onpretendingto sleep until Paenfinishedhis bath and leftthe room. Then she would go backto work on his tunic. However,she'd barely closedher eyes when the pretendingbecame reality.</p><p>Avelyn had slept deep and hard and woken up to find Paen inbed next toher. He hadn'tleft the room tosleep below with his men. He'd spent thenightnotinches away fromher... and she'd slept through thismost auspicious occasion.</p><p>Avelyn sighedover hersewing. Ifhe hadn't come to theirroom to bathe and she hadn't fallenasleep, shewouldhavefinished his tuniclastnight and presenteditto himthis morning. Instead, she got the first full night's sleep she'd had since the start of thisjourney, but the tunic wasunfinished.</p><p>She supposedit didn't mattermuch. Shewould finishit in an hour or so andthen be able to present it to him. At least he would be able to arrive home looking splendid, as the son ofthelordof the manner should look, insteadof asifhe'd just escaped a fire.</p><p>\"Avelyn!\"Diamanda rushed into the tent, thenpaused abruptly at the sight ofher sewing.</p><p>\"Aye?\" Avelyn asked, but Diamanda was staring at the tunic in her lap with amazement.</p><p>\"Why,you are nearlydone,\"she said withsurprise and came forwardto look at it. \" Tislovely. You are very goodat stitches. I can never seem to keep my seams straight,\"she admitted wryly, then frowned. \"But, again, itis too dark in here for you tobe doing such delicate work. \"</p><p>Avelyn glanced aroundto note with surprise that while she hadworked,the sun hadcontinued itsdownwardjourney.</p><p>\"Goodness,you will ruinyoureyes like this,\" Diamanda remonstrated, movingto collectthe candleoff the chestand carry it over to set onthe ground next to the stack of furs. Avelyn was surprised to see thatit waslit. Runilda must have once again slipped in andattended toitwithout hernoticing. She wasveryfortunate in having the girl for hermaid. Runilda didnot just dowhat wasexpected, butsawto those littleextras that made her indispensable.</p><p>\"There, that is better,\" Diamanda announced with a pleased smile as she straightened. \"At least we need not fear you shall go blind on us. \" She patted Avelyn's shoulder affectionately before leaving.</p><p>Avelyn stared after her,realizing that the girlhad beenso distracted by concern forher eyesthat she'd forgottento askor tell her whatever she'd come intothetent for. Shaking her head, she turned her attention back to her sewing, her mind ponderingwhatit mighthave been.</p><p>Momentslater, anexasperated Paenducked throughtheflap, muttering under his breath about silly, feather-brained girls. Avelyn quickly hid the tunic behind her back.</p><p>She offeredan enquiring smile as her husband straightened.</p><p>\"Diamanda wasto tellyou I can take youdownto the rivernow, if you like,\" he announced, then frownedas he spotted the candle on theground so close to the furs. \"Ye'll start a firesetting thecandle there, wife. \"</p><p>\"I - \" Avelyn closed her mouth onthe explanation that it hadn't been her, but Diamanda whohad put itthere. She wasn'tthe sort to tattle. Besides, she hadn't protested the girl's actions.</p><p>\"Blow it out,grab whatever you need and come along,\" Paen said, apparently decidingtolet the mattergo, then turned and ducked out of the tent.</p><p>Letting out a little breath of relief,Avelyn blew the candle out as shegot up,then collecteda wide swath of linen from the chest and hurried afterhim. \"Icannot hear you. \" Paen started to turn towardheras she bathed inthe river.</p><p>Avelyn immediately responded,\"I donot know what to say. \"</p><p>Paen stoppedturningand relaxeda little. This was the firsttime he'd taken herto bathe in a river since her near-drowning. Oncehere, he'd at first said he would not turn his back onher, explaining he did not wish another incident like that. However, when her shouldershad slumped andshe'd said she wouldbe fine without bathing that night,Paen had relented. It. seemed his wife was still shy. But he would not let her shyness deny her theopportunity tobathe after a long day in thesaddle. He'd agreed to keep hisback turned so longas she continuedto talk so that he knew she was well. At first, she'dsimply told him whatshe was doing: \"I am notin the water yet;I am stillundressing,\" she'dannounced the moment hisback was turned. \"Shall I just tellyou when Iam going to go in,or - ?\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Paenhad said abruptly, not wishing a blow-by-blow ofher stripping. His imagination was filling his mind with imagesenough on its own, and it wassheer torture. His wifewas clumsy, accident prone, weak and apparently not very hearty, but she was alsoa sexy little bundle. It was torture enough to have her riding before himduringthe day - hoursin the saddle with her bottom pressedup against him,her outer thighspressed against his inner, the bottoms of her breastsbrushing against the top of the arm he kept around her waist while they rode.</p><p>Paen hadspent agood deal of the last threedays trying tokeep from shifting in thesaddle to grind againsther, orraising his armto rub over herbreasts. Withher handling the reins, he'd had little else to dobut fantasize. Inthose fantasieshis hands werehealedandbusy - undoingandtugging the clothof her gown off her shoulders so that hernakedbreasts spilled out into his waitinghands, then squeezing and kneading thesoft round flesh, gently pinching each nipple. In his mind, he was kissing and nibblingher neckas he fondled her breasts, hersoft, excited murmurs and panting breath music tohis ears as heletone hand dropdown over her gently rounded stomach to slide betweenher legs, teasing her tosuch a level ofexcitement thatshe worked herself around to face him on the horse,thenworked him freeof his braes and managed - with hishelp - -to raise, then lower herself on his staff, which she rode evenas they rodehis horse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, inreality his mount probably wouldn'ttake well to suchgoings-onand would no doubtrear up and dump them both in the dirt. Butthen, in realityhis hands werebandaged stumpsandhe couldn't doanyof it anyway... whichwas something he resented mightily.</p><p>The firehadnot justinjured his hands and taken his clothes, it had robbed him of a wedding night... and every night since. Paenwas sure hewould have given hiswife a good \"seeingto\"every chance he'd gotten were he not injured. Certainly, his lower bodyshowed interest every time hewas near her. It no longer seemed tohelp that he avoided being nearher atnight,sleeping by the fire with themen rather than in the tentwithhernaked and sotemptingly near, yet as untouchable as a nun thanksto the state ofhis hands.</p><p>If hecould,Paen wouldmakeherride her own horse, butit was his place to train herin the areasshe waslacking. Although it did seem to him that she was a natural at horse riding, sheclaimed to not be confident enough inher skillsto ride alone. That being thecase, he saw it as hisduty to keep her on hismountuntilshe feltmoresure of herself. Having learned thehardway thatshe was accidentprone,Paenwasn't taking anyunnecessarychances.</p> <p>\"What should Italk about?\" Avelyn asked,distracting Paen fromhis thoughts.</p><p>\"It matters little, just speak,\" Paen said. \"Tell me what it was like growingup at Straughton. \"Paen wanted to know what she had been trained in. Riding was a skill most ladies wouldhave, and he thought it best toknow whathe was up againstand whathe would need to see her trained in.</p><p>\"Oh, well,\" Avelyn said, then launched into a ramblingspeech. Paensoon realized thathe should havebeenmore specific and simplyaskedwhatshe'dbeen taught, for his wife did tendtolike the soundof her own voice. Despite her obvious exhaustion, she hadtalked nonstop yesterday on the last day oftheir journey to Hargrove,and now to-day, the first of theirtwo-dayjourney home, she continued chattering. Not thathe really minded. In that time he had learneda lot about his wife. He was getting a ratherthoroughpictureof who shewas, ofherfamily and childhood.</p><p>Probablymore thorough than she realized, Paen thought. Avelyn did not say a cross wordabouther cousins. She did nottellhim theytaunted her and madeher feel inferior, or that their arrival at Straughton hadbeen a blight on what untilthen had been a perfect childhood, with loving parents, an affectionate brother and a secure home. Shedid notsay a word against them, and yet he saw it. He hadbeen quickto recognizethe trio asresentful andcruel,and hadfound littlepatience for them. Heunderstoodtheirresentmentat having their father,home andinheritance stolen from them,but thought little of their takingit out on Avelyn.</p><p>Paensupposedit wasenvy andaninstinctto gofor theweakest member of a group that made them behave so badly. They could not attack theiraunt anduncle the same way,and Warin wouldn't have hesitated tobeat them had theytried this business on him. No doubt he wouldbeat them when he caughtthemtormenting Avelyn,but Paen was equally sure that they never attacked her whenothers might witnessit, and that Avelynwould never tattle on them. Her refusal to carry tales was an honorable choice, but had left herundefended against theirverbal attacks onher self-esteem.</p> <p>By thetime Avelyn finished bathing and was safely out of the water dressing herself, Paenhad cometo the conclusionthat what he neededto teach his wife was her own value. He was also quitesure that he had notgottensuch aninept bride as he'd thought. Parentsas loving and caring ashers appeared to bewould notsend their daughter out into the world without the skills she'd need to carry on successfullyin life.</p><p>Paen suspected that Avelyn's clumsiness and apparent ineptitude were really just a result of herlow-esteem and awkwardnesswith him... justas David's tendencyto trip overhis own feet was a result ofnervousness and an eagernesstoplease.</p><p>Given timeand proper tending, Paenwas surehe would have himself the perfect wife.</p><p>\"Iam ready, husband. \"</p><p>Paen glanceddown at her andfound himself smiling. She was dressed inanother unattractive, overlarge and dark gown,and her hair was dampand scraped back harshly from her face. Still, herbeauty showed through to him. Her eyes werehuge and alight with goodhumor and kind-heartedness, andher mouth curved in agentle smile.</p><p>His parents haddonewell, Paendecided. He was pleased withthe bride they'd chosen for him. He thought he might even come to develop affection for her someday. For now, it was enough thatheliked her. It was good to likeawife. It made it easier to spenda lifetime with her.</p> <p>Realizing he was standingthere grinning like an idiot,Paen did hisbesttowipe the smilefrom his face and gesturedforher to move ahead of him to the path backto camp. As theywalked, he considered ways he mightbolster her selfesteem. If she werehis horse, he'd feed her anapple every once in a while and pat her on the rump.</p><p>If she were his squire,he'dgive her ahearty pat on the back and a\"well done. \" Paen hadnoidea,though, how to bolster a wife.</p><p>\"Oh, no!What - ?\"</p><p>Avelyn's startled cry drewhim from hismusings. He started to ask what had upset her so,but she wasalready rushing toward their tent. Paen followed,noticing thata crowd had gathered around the smoking tent.</p><p>Cursing, he broke intoa run, chasingafter Avelynas she pushed her way through the crowd.</p><p>\"Wife!\"He caught her armto try tostop heras she started to duck into the tent, recalling hisbandaged hands only when his linenstump slid uselessly offherarm.</p><p>Cursing, he ducked intothe tent after her.</p><p>\"'Tis all right,\" his mother said as she turnedfrom surveying the damage. \"No onewas hurt, and that is the most important thing. \"</p> <p>\"Aye,\" his father agreed, moving quicklytohis side.</p><p>Judgingby the mournful cryas Avelynstared at the charred remains ofthe furs, Paen guessed shedidn't agree.</p><p>\"What happened?\" he asked grimly.</p><p>\"It looks asif acandle set the fursalight,\" his father admitted reluctantly.</p><p>Paen immediately glared at his wife and growled, \"I told you it was too close to the furs. I also told you to blow it out before comingwithme. \"</p><p>\"Idid!\" she cried. \"I didblow itout. \"</p><p>\"Obviously not,\" he snapped. \"No doubt youwere in a rushand justgave it a goodblow, then came after mewithoutwaiting to see that it was out. \"</p><p>Avelyn's shoulders saggedin defeat. \"Youareright,husband. That mustbewhat happened. Thisis all my fault. \"</p><p>Paen frowned at her reaction; she sounded heartbroken, and huge tears were rolling down hercheeks. It was damned hard to give hera dressing-downfor this latest catastrophe when sheappeared sobeaten.</p><p>Sighing, he shifted on his feet andmuttered, \"Well, 'tis justa bunchof furs. No onewas hurtandnothingimportantwas damaged. \"</p><p>\"Nothing important,\" Avelyn echoed, then,much to hisbewilderment, droppedto herknees and burst into greatnoisy sobs.</p><p>Paen was more thanrelievedwhen his mother shooed him and his fatherout of thetent, assuring themshewould tendto Avelyn. He hadn't a clue whatto do for her. It was obviousshe'd grownanattachmentto the fur bed - thatwas the only thing he could think of. Her chest was at the oppositeend of the tentand untouched by the fire. It was only the furs thathad suffered. Apparently, someone had noted the firebefore it spread far. Even the tent itself was undamaged.</p><p>Aye, it mustbe the furs she was upset about, Paen decided, and determinedto get awhole passelof them for her when they reachedGerville castle. He'd have them arranged in frontof thefireplacefor her so shecould lieonthem whenevershe liked.</p><p>In fact,he would join her there. The ideawasappealing - relaxing beforea roaring fire on a chill winter evening, drinking mulledcider.</p><p>No, no cider, hedecided. Avelynwouldprobably spill itdownher dress. Taking thecider away might affect her self-esteem, though, andmake her think he believed her clumsybeyond redemption. Perhaps if he gother naked first and then gaveher mulled cider beforetheroaring fireon the furs?Aye, thatwould work, he decided, smiling at the image. Avelynnaked, a goblet of mulled cider in her hand. He wouldn't even mind ifshe did spill itthen. He would simplylean forward and lick it off of her.</p><p>Now, that was an idea. Licking cider off ofher full roundbreasts,letting his tongue curl around her nipples, coaxingthem erect, then - \"What the hell are yesmiling about?Yerwife just setyourbed on fire,\" his father snapped.</p><p>\"Aye, she did. \"Paen'ssmile widened, thenhe caught himself and managedto dampenhis expression.</p><p>\" 'Tis sorry I am, son. Avelyn is a nice enough girl, but she does seem proneto calamity. IfI had realized - \"</p><p>\"She is fine. Thereis no need to apologize. I amwell pleased with her to wife. \"</p><p>\"What?\" Wimarc Gervillestared athimwithamazement. \"Didshe knock you over so ye hityour head while the two of youweredown by the river?\"</p><p>\"No, of course not. \"Paen scowledat the suggestion.</p><p>\"Well, somethinghas happened,\" his father said. \"You've donelittle butfretand worry that she is sickly andineptsince first seeing her. And now, when she has burned yourbed to a pile of ash, you are 'well pleasedwith herto wife'?\"</p><p>Paen frowned attheolderman inirritation,but didn't arguethepoint. Instead, he calledhis new squire tohim and headed for the riverto bathe andconsider ways he might start work on hiswife'sself-esteem.</p><p>\"Avelyn,my dear. Please do not take on so. \" Lady Gerville knelt beside herand wrapped her arms aroundher.</p><p>Avelyntriedto stop weeping,butcouldn'tseem to helpit. She simply sagged againstthe woman and sobbed her heartout. She wasexhaustedfrom lack ofsleep, and really, this was just too much. Everything hadgone wrong since the wedding, absolutelyeverything. Thisburning of the furs was justthe final straw.</p><p>Avelyn had counted on the tunic and braes repairing much of her husband's mistaken opinion of her. She couldn't tell him thatshe could ride, orthat shewasn't presently proneto misfortune - for clearly she was - but giving him thetunicand braes wouldhave shown at least one ofher skillsin a good light. It also would have given herthe opportunity to let him know that she wasn't normally sowearyand sickly. She could haveexplained thatshe was exhausted during the daybecause she had been working nights on his clothes. On top of allthat, she'd workedso hard, andall that workhadbeenruined in a moment of inattention. Avelyn had thought the candle was outandeven had avaguememory of the small curl of smokecoming off it, butapparently she'd been wrong.</p><p>\"Avelyn, dear,\" Lady Gerville almost moaned as she rocked her in her arms.</p><p>\"Surelythis isnot aboutthe furs. They arereplaceable. \"</p><p>Avelyn shook her head against the woman's chest. Her tears were finally slowing, but she was in no state to talk.</p><p>\"What is it, then, child? Is it that you fear Paen willjust see this as another example of your clumsinessandineptitude?\"</p><p>Avelyn paused, then burstinto loud sobsagain.</p><p>LadyGerville gave up tryingtosoothe her for a while and simplyrocked her like a child. When her crying finally slowed to sniffles and hiccoughsand Avelyn finally pulled free to hold herselfupright, Lady Gerville took her hand and patted it as she waited forhertospeak.</p><p>\"Do you think youcan tell menow?\" she asked after another moment had passed.</p><p>Avelynnoddedwearily, but merely sat staringwith dejection at the smoldering remains of the bed.</p><p>\"Would you likea drinkfirst?\" Lady Gerville prompted. \"I could call Runildaand have her fetch some mead. \"</p><p>Avelyn shook her head.</p><p>Another moment of silence passed; then Lady Gerville opened her mouth to speak again, butAvelyn blurtedout, \"I have beensewing new braes anda tunic for Paen. \"</p><p>Lady Gerville relaxed andpatted her hand. \"Aye, dear. I know,\"she said,then explained, \"I was fretting over your being so exhausted all the time and Sely mentioned it to your maid. Runilda told her totell me not to fret,that you were staying up well intothe night, sewing newclothesfor Paen. \" She pattedher hand again. \"Runilda said tonight that they were nearly done. \"</p><p>\"They were,\" Avelyn admitted,and muchto her consternation, fresh tears began toroll downhercheeks.</p><p>\"Were?\" Lady Gerville asked with the beginnings of dread inhervoice.</p><p>Avelyn nodded. \"I was working on them whenPaen came to fetch meto goto the river. I set themaside on the furs, blew at the candle,thenhurried after him. \" She shook her head miserably. \"I thoughtthe candlewas out. Idid notreally wait to see, but Ijust assumed - \"</p><p>\"You mean they went up with the furs?\" Lady Gervilleaskedwithhorror.</p><p>Avelyn nodded.</p><p>\"Oh,you poor child!\" Paen's mother drew her into herarmsagain, but Avelyn seemed to bemostlyout oftears. Shedid manageone gaspingsob, but that was it.</p><p>The wellwas dry. She'dcried herselfout.</p><p>They satin silence for severalminutes,but Lady Gerville seemed to be at a loss as to what to sayto make the situation better. She just kept murmuring \"poor child\"</p><p>over andover,and Avelyn supposed therereally wasn't anything that couldbe said tomakeherfeel better atthatpoint. She was exhausted. Depressed anddefeated. All she really wantedtodo was sleep.</p><p>Just then Selyduckedinsidecarrying a couple of furs.</p><p>\"LordGerville hadmebringtheseover,\"she explained, then glanced behindher and stepped outof the way toallow Runilda toenter. Avelyn's maid was followed byfourmen.</p><p>\"Lord Gerville sentthe men toremove the burned furs,\" Runildasaid. Avelyn knew that whileSely was referringto Paen's father whenshesaid \"Lord Gerville,\"</p><p>Runildawasreferring to Paen himself as Lord Gerville. Forsome reason, the fact thatboth were Lord Gerville madean almosthysterical giggle slip from her throat.</p><p>Lady Gerville lookedher over withconcern. \"Come, let us get out of theway, dear, so they canwork. \"</p><p>Avelyn allowedLadyGerville tohelp her to herfeet, and movedto the corner of the tent withthe olderwoman as the men began to drag the damaged furs out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Runilda had brought aleaf-filled branch withher and used it to sweeptheremaining ashesoutofthe tent. The moment that was done, she fetched some linens from Avelyn's chest's.

I shall have Runilda fetchyou whenthe sup is ready. \"</p><p>\"Iam not hungry,\" Avelyn said dully as sheallowed herself to be tucked into the bed. She didsee theconcerned glances the women exchanged,but couldn'tseemto work up the energytocareabout it.</p> <p>\"Just rest for now, dear,\"LadyGerville said finally. \"You'llfeelbetterafter some sleep. \"</p><p>Avelyn dutifully closed her eyes and was asleepat once.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Paen hadjustcome in fromoverseeing the men's training and hadsettled himself at the trestle table to enjoy somemead when thesound of a woman's soft step made him tense and glance toward the stairs. He relaxed the instanthe realized it was his mother. Fora moment, Paen hadfearedit was his wife. He wasn't in the mood for hersad face just then.</p><p>\"Oh, Paen. \"His mother moved alittle more quickly when she saw him. \"Good - I wanted to talk to you. Where is your father?\"</p> <p>\"He's just coming up from the stables now. He shallbe here shortly,\" Paen answered,thenarched an eyebrow. \"Where is my wife?\"</p><p>\"She is in thesolar, sewing. \"</p><p>\"Of course she is,\" hesaiddryly. Hiswife seemed everto be sewing, but hehad yet to seeany resultsfrom it. Paen assumed it was anew gown shewas working on.</p><p>The few shepossessed seemed all to be dark,drab and too large for her. He'dbeen hoping shewas producing a new onethat would be more colorful and fit properly, but surely itdidn't take this long to make one.</p><p>She had been sewing intheir tent the few times he'dpeeredin tocheck on heron their journey, and it was all she'd done in the three days since arriving atGerville,that or sleeping. Orweeping. Sometimes sheeven weptin her sleep.</p><p>While Avelyn hadseemed a happychatterbug during the journey to collect his squire,all had changed onthelast dayof the journey toGerville. Since thenight of thefire, she'dbeen walking misery. Paen missed hercheerful chatter, butmorethan that, he couldn't stand to see her soweary and unhappy, especiallysince he didn't have aclue what to doabout it. He'd hopedshe was justmissingher familyand wouldgetover it, but rather thanrecover her good cheer, she seemed toget more melancholy eachday.</p> <p>\"You neednot sound so putout. She is making new braes and a tunic for you.</p><p>Again,\" his mother added testily as the hall doors opened and Wimarc Gerville entered.</p><p>\"Anewbraes and tunic? For me?\" Paen asked with amazement. \"Whatever for? She is the one who needs new clothes,not I. \"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Lord Gerville agreed ashe approached the table. \"The girl does not have a single gown that fits her,and every one she hasseems to be darkand drab. \" He pausedto kisshis wifeon the cheek, thensettledon the bench next toPaen. \"I supposethe blue one that burst atthe wedding dinner and the red one that went up in flames were theonly colorfulgowns shepossessed. \"</p><p>Lady Gerville frowned at herhusband, then turned to glare at Paen. \"Yourwife stayed up nightsduring ourjourney sewing younewclothes toreplace those ruined in the fire. Tiswhy shewas always inthe tent of a night, and always exhausted duringthe day. She was making clothes for you. \"</p><p>Paen blinked at the news, but it was his fatherwho commented first. \"Well,she is damnedslowat sewing if she isnot yetfinished. \"</p><p>\"Wimarc. \" Lady Gervillefrowned at her husband. \"She had nearly completed them when they burned upin the tent. She was quitedistraught,but started on them again when she got here. I believe shehas another setnearly done. \"</p><p>\"Hmm. \" Paen's father scowled at thereminderof thefire. \"Is that why she has beenso unhappy?Because ofa set ofclothes?\"</p> <p>\"Ibelieveit is partof it, butIthink she is also missing her family. \" Lady Gerville turneda displeasedlook on Paen. \"And you are not helpingwiththat. \"</p><p>\"Me?\" Hiseyes widened. \"What can I do to help with this? I have done naughtto cause her unhappiness. \"</p><p>\"Youhave done naught to prevent it either,\" she argued. \"You payAvelyn less attentionthanthe dogs. You at least throw thema bone oncein a while. \"</p><p>Paen scowled. \"Well, I cannotpay her attention,or have youforgotten my hands are injured?\"</p><p>\"I did not mean bedding her,\" she said with exasperation. \"Have you spoken more than awordtoherat all?\"</p><p>\"Spoken to her?\" he asked with disbelief, and his mother'seyes narrowed.</p><p>\"Have you been soblindallthese years? Or is it that you have been awayon Crusade so long that youhave forgottenthatyour father speaks to me all the time?\"</p><p>\"That is notwhat I meant,\" Paen said with irritation. \"I meant she is the one... well, she used to bethe one who... she was quite - \"</p><p>\"Hemeans hecouldnot get aword in edgewise on thejourney here,\" his father said with amusement. \"At least when she was on horseback. \"</p><p>\"Aye, well,I suspect that was an effort to keep awake,\" Lady Gervillesaid.</p><p>\"Aye, Inoticed the girl likes to sleep a lot,\" Wimarcsaid dryly. \"She slepton horseback one day when shewas supposedtobe learning to ride. \"</p><p>\"Only oneday,\" Lady Gerville defended her. \"Andthat was only becauseshe'd beenupall night sewing. \" Shepaused, thensighed. \"I promised not to tell you but I know she is also upset that you think she is so inept, so I am going to share something with you. \"</p><p>Paen and his father exchanged a glance. it was Wimarcwho said, \"She is not so inept?\"</p><p>\"Nay,\" LadyGerville said firmly.</p><p>\"Wife, I knowyou like her,but thegirlcannot even ride ahorse,\" Wimarc pointed out.</p><p>\"Aye, she can. \"</p><p>\"She - \"</p><p>\"Mother is right,\" Paen interrupted whenhis fatherwould have argued thepoint.</p><p>\"Avelyn may not have been able to ridewhen we first leftStraughton, butsheis a natural.

She - like me - feared you woulddo your handsfurther injury, so she let you thinkshecould notride sothat you wouldlet her take thereinswhile you'trained' her. \"</p><p>His father snorted at thesuggestion. \"The chit slept through thesecond day. \"</p><p>\"Because shewas upallnightsewing,\"Lady Gerville remindedhim. \"But she sewedeach nightafter that, yet stayed awake despiteherexhaustion. \"</p><p>Lord Gerville considered this news. \"So, you are saying the girl is trained in proper wifery?\"</p><p>\"Aye. Her mothergave me a list ofher skills at the weddingmeal. She is fully trained,probablybetter than most girls her age. \"</p><p>\"Running a household? Tending injuries and illness? Instructing staff?\" he queried.</p><p>\"Aye, all that and more. \"</p><p>\"Thenwhyhas shenot tendedto Paen's injured hands?

You have everything well inhand and she has nothing to do. Shehas nowayto make aplace for herself. She islike a guest here. \"</p><p>Lady Gervillemoved to the bench and droppedto siton itbetween herhusband andson. \"Ihadnot thought of that. \"</p><p>\"I know,\" Lord Gerville said softly. He was silentfor a moment, then said, \"I received news on ourarrival here that old Legere is dead. \"</p><p>\"Aye,I know,\"Lady Gerville said withsomeconfusion. \"You toldme at the time. \"</p><p>\"He was my chatelain at Rumsfeld,\" Paen's fatherpointedout, speaking of his wife'schildhoodhome.

They were seated at thehigh table,eating dinner. Avelyn sat betweenLady Gerville and Lady Helen. Paen, as usual, was not there. He had been seated atthe table speaking to his fatherwhen she'dcome belowstairs, but had left shortly afterward.</p><p>Avelynsupposedhehad leftto get awayfromher.

She didn't know where hewas sleeping either, but it wasn'twithher.</p><p>\"You sighed,dear,\" Lady Helenpointed out gently. \"Areyou unhappy?\"</p><p>Avelyn forced asmileto her lips. Lady Helen was akind woman,as was Paen's mother. All of them had been wonderful to her sincetheir arrival at Gerville - kind andconsiderate and keepinghercompany all the time so thatshe hardly noticedthat her own husband couldn't be botheredwith any of that. Avelyn sighed againthen realized she'd done it and shookher head, impatient with herself. \"I amsorry,my lady. \"</p><p>\"You neednotapologize,Avelyn. \" Lady Gerville joined the conversation and patted her hand. \"It is hardly yourfault. \"</p><p>Avelyngrimaced atthe word fault. \"But I should apologize to you for Paen's never joining us at table. That apparently is my fault. \"</p><p>\"What?\" Lady Gerville appearedsurprised atthe claim.</p><p>Avelyn swallowed and admitted, \"Your son does notseem pleasedwithmeas his wife.

I suspectthe answerwill surprise you. \"</p><p>Avelyn stared at her with bewilderment. She hadn't understood much of what Lady Gerville had said. So manysecrets? Who had secrets?She supposed shehad made the woman keep one or two herself. Now itseemed that hersweren't the only secrets here.</p><p>\"Go,\" Lady Gervilleinsisted, drawing her from her thoughts.</p><p>Avelyn glanced at Lady Helen, butDiamanda'saunt appeared tobeas perplexed asshe was. She got reluctantlyto her feet, stepped over the bench and moved slowly toward the stairs. Part of her wascurious atwhat shemight find upstairs, but most of her simply didn't want toknow. It wasbad enough suspecting herhusband could notbear to benearher. Toactually havehimtell her so wouldbe much worse.</p><p>Avelyngrimaced at her owncowardice. Her parentshad not raisedher to be a coward, but so muchhad happened in the last week - shefelt rather like thecamel whose back mightbreak with the next straw setonit.</p><p>Not thatit was allbad. Thingswere a little better hereat Gerville. In someways, living here was likebeing home again. Lady Gervillewas much like her mother, running the castle with seemingeffortless ease. It leftAvelyn with nothingto do but sew, but she didn't mind that so much. With her track record to date, she was relieved not to have tasks and chores to attend to that might further reveal the ineptitude she hadn't realized shesuffered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Avelyn felt safer sewing new clothesfor Paen instead. Fortunately, Paen's brother Adam hadbeen the same size andPaen was now wearing a pair ofthe deadman's braes as wellas one of histunics. Avelyn still felt he should have clothes of his own, soshe was pleasedto make themforhim. At least sheknew she was competent at that. And it was very pleasantspendingthe day chatting with Dia-manda, Lady Helen and Lady Gerville whileshesewed. Lady Gerville and Helenwere very kind,and Diamanda was bright and seemed tohave appointedherself the task of tryingto cheer Avelyn.</p><p>Avelyn's only discontent came from her husband's apparent rejection of her.</p><p>What elsecouldit be? The man avoidedher atall times,and had yetto bed her. It was dishearteningafter the high hopesshe'd had on herwedding night,when hehad touched and caressed her with seemingenthusiasm.</p> <p>Avelyn'smusingscame toanabrupt end asshefoundshe'd reached the room nexttothe one she was supposed to share with her husband.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she put her earto the door, tryingto anticipate whatto expect, butthere was nothing to hear,not evena murmurof voices. Straighteningher shoulders, Avelyn raised herhandto knock, then recalled that Lady Gervillehad instructed her not to knock.</p><p>Loweringherhand, shehesitated a momentmore,thenopenedthe door.</p><p>Davidhad just slippeda spoonfulof stewinto his mouth whenPaenheard the door open. He turned toward it, expecting to see his father, then nearly chokedas he spied his wifestandingthere. He stared. The surprise on Avelyn's face told him she hadn't expectedhim to behere,orperhaps she'd knownhe was here but hadn't expectedhimtobe eating.</p><p>Paen'sgazeslid backto his squire. He'd been most relievedto finally have the boy at hisside. Thefirst fewdays afterthefire had beenthemost frustratingof his life. The injurytohis hands had madeit difficult to manage the simplestof chores - feeding himself, dressing,bathing. Even relievinghimself became something of an exercise in humiliation. He couldusethe stumps topush his braes down over his hips, buthad difficulty gettingthem back up. His father hadhelpedas much as he could,but it had been humiliating for Paen.</p> <p>Aye, the day they'd reached Hargrove had been a bright one for Paen. He'dthen hadthe boy to help him with such things, butPaen wastoo proud to alloweveryone else to realizehow helpless he was, no matter how temporary thathelplessness might be. So, every mealtime since they had collected the lad, he'd hadDavidbring his meal to him away fromeveryone else. The boy fedhim ina clearing by the river the first night oftheir journey. Thesecond night, they'd arrived at Gerville, and Paenhad askedDavid to bringhis meal up here to Adam'sold room. Then the lad had helped himstrip for his bath, though that was wherehe drewthe line. The lad had offered - rather reluctantly - to help with scrubbing up, but Paensimply couldn'tsubject either himself or the boytothatembarrassment, so he madedo with soaking in thewater.</p><p>They'd followed the same pattern each night since. Every morning, David helped him dress,then followedhim around,doing his squire's duties untilthe nooning meal, when they returned to the keep and Paen came up to waitwhile the boy collected hismealfrom the kitchen and brought it up to feed him. He didthe same for the evening meal. Then atnight, the boy helped him prepare for bed before taking tohis own pallet in thecorner.</p><p>\" Tis fine,David. I amdone. Youcan take that back to the kitchens. \"</p><p>The squire hesitated briefly, clearly doubtful that Paen was done with his half-eaten food,but he noddedand moved past Avelyn andout of the room. Paen thenturnedhis attention to hiswife, who washesitating in the door. Finally she drew her shoulders up, stepped into the room and closed the door behind her. Paen waited warily for her to speak, but when she finally did,herwordswereunexpected.</p><p>\"So youdo not stay awayfrom thetableat mealtimestoavoid me ?\"</p><p>Paen felt hismouthdrop open in shock,thenhe quickly closed it and said, \"Why would youthink that?\"</p> <p>Avelynlether breath out onaslow sigh. \"Becauseyouseem to constantly be avoidingme. You leave aroom shortly after I enter it, as you did today whenIcame below. You have notsat at table withme since arrivinghere. And while you joined me in our roomatHargrove, youwould notshare our tent, nor have you slept in your ownbed sincearriving hereatGerville. \" Shesaid the last part in a rush,her faceflaming.</p><p>Paen blinked inconfusion. \"I leftthe hall when you enteredtonight because I knewit wastimefor the sup and - as you now know - I have been eating up here. \"</p><p>\"Aye, I understand that now,\" she said quietly, but ducked her head and mumbled, \"However, thatdoesnotexplainyour reluctance toshare ourmarriage bed...I understand if you do notwantme. I know Iam notthe most attractive - \"</p><p>Paen snorted,andshe glanceduptofrown at him.</p><p>\"There is noneed tobe rude about it, my lord husband. I am awarethat I am overlarge and - \"</p><p>Anothersnort slid from Paen'slips and he shookhis head. \"You are beautiful, wife. \"</p><p>He saw theanger in her eyes and wondered if she really didnot know how lovely shewasto him. But then, he realizedsuddenly, of course shedidn't. Her cousins had spent years doingwhat they couldto convince her that she wasn't. He just wished he had realizedthis while hewas still at Straughton. He wouldhave done more than threaten them.</p><p>\"Oh, aye,\" Avelyn said wryly. \"I am so beautiful you have yet to consummate our marriage, and 'tis more than a week afterit wasdone. \"</p> <p>Paen gaspedin disbelief, thenheld up his bandaged hands. \"Tis abit difficultto bed you just at the moment,wife. \"</p><p>\"Hugo said 'twas not your hands that were im-portant, and that ifyou could ride a horse, you could ride me,\" Avelyn snapped, then realized what she'd said and blushed at repeating thecrude words.</p><p>\"Hugo,\"Paen saidwithdisgust. \"Whywould youbelievehim?\"</p><p>\"Because heis aman and more versed atsuch things,\"Avelyn said quiedy,then tilted her head and asked, \"Is it nottrue, then? Was Hugo wrong?\"</p><p>\"Aye, he was wro - \" Paen came to a sudden halt as he realized he would be lying. He could consummate the marriagewith her, Of course. Itwould be difficult but not impossible. While his hands wereuseless,his manhood was notand had let himknow itseveraltimessince the fire. He couldn't sit on a horsebehind herwithout ending upas stiff as a sword, andwhen he'd had totakeher to bathein the river... Dear God, he hadn'teven had to see her, just the sounds of her disrobing and splashing inthe waterwereenough to have him erect asa post.</p><p>Paenhad avoidedsleeping next to her at nightbecausethe ideaofbeingclose enough to smell her and reach out and touch her, but still unable to, had been unpalatable. He'd had no choice the night they'd stayedat Hargrove - Paen would never have humiliatedher by asking for hisownroom - but other thanthat,he'd slept as far away from herashe could and had intendedto do so untilhe was recovered enough to finally doall thethings he'd been fantasizingabout.</p><p>Apparently, that decision hadled his wife to believe he couldn't bear to benear her. He'd merely added to the poor image her cousins had worked so hardto instill in her.</p><p>Sighing, he tried to explain. \"Without my hands to help, it would be uncomfortable for you, but aye,itwould be possible to consummate the marriage.</p><p>We could not doit inthenormal way, Of course. You would have toperhaps siton the window ledge,or bend over something...\"</p><p>Paen's words slowed as his mind was immediately filled with images of the possibilities. Avelynsitting on the windowledge, him urging herlegsapartwith his body, then movingbetween them, his body brushing againsthers as he kissed her, then drovehimselfinto her. This picturewasquickly followed by an image ofher bendingover the ledge as hedroveinto her from behind.</p><p>\"Are you saying you have neglected to consummate our marriage out of consideration formydiscomfort?\"</p><p>Avelyn's voice drewhim from his imaginings and Paen scowled at her. Muchto his annoyance, shedidn'tsound asif she believed him. \"Well, aye, of course,and 'tis whyIhavenot been joining youin our bed. Did youreally thinkI preferredthe hard-packed earth to the softwarm fursin ourtent?\"</p><p>\"Nay, of course not,\" she said, and her voice too was becoming impatient.</p><p>\"Which is why I assumedyou prefer the hard-packed earthtomycompany. \"</p><p>Paen opened his mouth, then closed it again. He could understand that her cousins had affected her confidence, but he thought his desire for her on their weddingnight had been pretty obvious. He'd been asstiff asa sword andeager as a lad his first time out. How could she have missed that?</p><p>Paen pursed hislips ashe considered one reason she might have missed it. \"Were you sottedonour wedding night?\"</p><p>\"No!\" Avelynsaid,appearing shocked at the question.</p><p>\"Well, then surely you noticed my\" - Paen paused, seeking an alternate term for the crude one that came to mindtodescribehis erection - \"eagerness. \"</p><p>WhenAvelyn juststaredathim, Paen heaved his breath out on an exasperated sigh. \"Trust me, wife,if my hands werenot injuredI would be consummating our marriageevery chance I could. ButI will not cause you unneeded pain. \"</p><p>Avelyn bither lowerlip and paused a moment before responding. \"Well, my mother did warn me of what to expect, and shesaid that the first time could be quite uncomfortable and evenpainful. I appreciateyour concern, but if you wish to - \"</p><p>\"Avelyn,\" Paeninterrupted. \"You donot know what youare asking. The firsttime is notalwayspleasant for the woman,but without my hands it could bedownright unpleasant. \"</p><p>\"I see,\" Avelyn murmured,then jumped at a knock onthe door. Turning, she openedit to findDavid standingthere, looking uncertain.</p><p>The boy glanced fromher toPaen. \"Did you still want yourbath,my lord? Or shall I - ?\".</p><p>\"Iwill leaveyou to yourbath,\" Avelyn murmuredandslipped outof theroom.</p><p>With a sinkingheart,Paen watchedher go. He was sure he'd seen the sheen of tearsin her eyesbefore she'd turned away, and knew hehadn't managed toconvince herof thetruth. Nor did he know what to doabout it.</p><p>Realizing David was still standing in thedoor,hewaved him in. Paen hadbeen overseeingthe practice fieldtoday and hadtaken a tumble whenone of the menhad bumped into him. The fieldhad been muddyafter last night's rain,and while David had used arag to wipe the worst of the mudawayat the time, he needed a bathto removeall of it. However, Paen hadn't been willing to trouble the kitchen staff to heat upwater forhim, sohaddecidedtowait until after thesup.</p><p>Paen pondered the problem of what to do about his wife as his bath was prepared. He found himselfonlyhalf listening to thelad's chatterasthe tub was carried inand filled for his bath. Hehad alreadynoticed the boyhad a great deal in common with his wife. Aside from showing a propensity to clumsiness, the lad could carry on whole conversations without anyone else contributingtoit.</p><p>Oddly enough,Paen found this tendency soothing. WithDavid,the chatter was generally about battles, weapons and horses. Of course, the firstnight he had served as Paen's squire, David had asked if his handshadbeenburned during a battle with a dragon. He'dseemed mightily disappointedto learn that it wasn'ta dragon thathad wounded his master,then had gone on tolecture Paen about the dangerous and dastardly nature ofdragons.</p><p>He'd explained quite authoritatively that they had the very worst case of bad breath ever,andtended to eat ladiesandmakethem cry.</p><p>Thetub was full, the room empty. David helped Paen to disrobe before he said anything that actuallyrequired a response. \"What do you dowhenyou bed a lady?\"</p><p>Paen gaped at the lad, his mouth open for a moment before he gasped with amazement,\"Why wouldyou ask about bedding?\"</p><p>\"Well, I heard Lady Helen telling one of the maids thatLady Avelynthinks you aredispleased with her becauseyou havenot yetbedded her,\" he explained,\"Are you not tucking her in ofa night?\"</p><p>\"DearGod, the whole castle knows,\" Paen muttered as he stepped out of his braes and into the tub, then realized thatheshould have expectedas much. It was impossible to keepsecrets in a castle. He suggestedthe boy go below and ask the cook for a sweet treat to enjoywhile he waited for Paen to finish soaking.</p><p>Once the boywas gone, Paen sankintothe water and closed his eyes as he pondered what to do about hiswife. It seemed obvious he couldn'tleavethings as theywere, but hedidn't know what to do. He was rather sure he wouldn'tbeableto convince her with simple verbalarguments. Paen had neverconsideredhimself very good at such things. He was more comfortable with taking action than merely discussingmatters. Hehadn't a clue whathecould say to convince Avelynthat he reallydid find her attractiveand wished tobed her. Paen suspected he could say so untilhe wasbluein the face and she would not believe him. Probably theonly wayto convince her was to actuallybed her. He was mightily temptedto do so. However, she wouldn't thankhimfor it afterward, despite what she said.</p><p>Avelynhad no cluewhat shewas askingfor, and Paen couldnotprepareher properly without his hands tocaress and hold her. Without his hands, he had only his mouth to work with - Paensatup abruptly in the tub, sendingwatersplashing every which way as a wave of images andthoughtsassaultedhis mind. Avelyn naked before him. Him kissingandcaressing her with hismouthuntil shecried out with pleasure. Him rising upanddrivinghimself into her... \"Damn, why did I not think ofthat before?\" hemuttered, then shoutedfor his squire.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Avelyn returnedtoherroom to find a tub half full of water andRunilda stoking a fireto life in thefireplace. She was surprised the servants had managed to heat enoughwater for twobaths, andalmostwished they hadn't goneto all the trouble.</p><p>All shereallywanted wastogotobed.</p><p>Avelyn was discouraged after her talk with Paen, though not as depressed as she'd been before it. She didn't believe his claim that he was refraining from consummating themarriageout of consideration for her. Even he had admitted that it was possible todo so despite the injuryto his hands, which, she supposed, meant he wasn't consummating it because hecouldn't bebothered. However, it was a relief toknow that hewasn'tso repulsed by her that he was avoiding the table atsup. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Avelyn rushed through herbath, thenwrapped herself in a linen andmoved to sit by the fireto dry her hair before the flames. She was still seated there several moments later when thechamber door suddenly opened and Paen entered.</p><p>\"Husband?\" Avelyn turnedon herchair and stared at him with surprise, noting that hetoo wore only aswath of linen, though his was much smallerand wrapped around his waist.</p><p>\"Ihave figured itout,\" Paen announcedby way of greeting,and Avelyn stared at the wide smileon his face, unsure what to make of it. Her husband hadn't smiled much since she'd knownhim; forsome reason his wide grin just made her nervous.</p> <p>\"You have figured what out,husband?\"she asked with bewilderment.</p><p>Paen crossed the room to the window. \"Comehere, wife. \"</p><p>Avelyn felt her eyes squinching up with suspicion as she recalled his saying something abouthersitting on thewindowledge. Surely he didn't intendto - Nay, Avelyn told herselfas she got reluctantly to her feet. Theman had followed thatpictureupwithridiculous explanations about how it wouldhurt. He had goneon aboutdiscomfortshe'd already known she'd experience with orwithout his hands.</p><p>Her mother hadnot left herignorant ofthemarriage bed. Expecting the marriageto beconsummated on the weddingnight, she'dexplainedtheordealquite thoroughly, andhadsaid that,while painful the first time,it could be quite enjoyable afterward if Avelyn was fortunate enough to havea considerate husband.</p><p>Having listened withbated breath to her mother's descriptionsofwhat exactly wouldtakeplace, Avelynhad found it difficult to imagineanyof it beingenjoyable.</p> <p>Still,her mother was notprone tolie to her,so she'd given her the benefit of the doubt before the wedding night. Andeven though they'd never completed theact, Avelyn had experienced more thanalittle pleasure inher marriage bed underher husband'skisses and caresses... at least until theroom had gone up inflames.</p><p>Avelyn pausedbeside her husband at the window and waited curiously.</p><p>Paen smiled at her brilliantly and then suddenly nudged at his linen with his bandaged hand. The covering dropped to the rushes with aplop.</p><p>Avelyn gaped. Hismanhood was hardas a rock and standing up like a pole sticking out ofthe ground. Shemanagedto tear her eyes fromhis hugestaff andlift them to his face for half a second, then let them drop down to hismanhood again.</p><p>She hadseen it before, of course, on their weddingnight. Only Avelyn didn't recallit being quiteso big then... or... well... solid.</p><p>Avelyn was suddenly gratefulthat he'd decided to waituntil recovering from his burns beforeconsummating their marriage. Shedidn't even mindso much ifhe had a disgust of her... And whatwasso wrong with aman having amistress?Why did men not just stabwomen with their swords?It surely couldn't be any worsethan having those great huge thingsimpaling them.</p> <p>Realizing she was becoming alittle hysterical over somethingshe needn't yet fear, Avelyn again forced her gaze upward andmanagedwhat she hopedwasa pleasant smile ofenquiry.</p><p>\"Why are you grimacing?\" Paenasked, and Avelyn supposedshe hadn't managed a very good smile after all.</p><p>\"I...\"She sought a viableexcuse, but nothingwascoming tomind, and after a moment Avelyn gave it up andinstead asked,\"You said youhad figured something out?\"</p><p>\"Oh, aye. \" Turning,he drew the fur away from the window and forced it to the side,allowing moonlight into the room.</p><p>Avelyn turnedto peer curiouslydown intothe bailey below,but couldsee very little. The ledge wasa good three feet deep,andshe would havehadto practically lie on itto get her head nearthe window itself, so she peeredatthe glass insteadand tried for asuitably interestedexpression. Glass was veryexpensive,such a rarity. It really wasimpressive that thewindows actually had glass in them. If she hadn't known she'd marriedinto a wealthy family, this wouldhave told her.</p><p>\"Well, this isa veryfine window, mylordhusband. Thank you for showing itto - Awk!\"Avelyn squealed insurprise and grabbed athis shoulders ashesuddenly turnedhertofacehim, then caughther under the armpits and set her onto the ledge.</p><p>\"What areyou - \"</p><p>Avelyn's questiondied aquickdeath,silenced by Paen'slips ashegrabbedher by both knees, pushed themapart andstepped betweenthem to press a kiss toher mouth. Atfirst, she wastoo startled totry to pullawayand sayanything, but within moments ofhis mouthcovering hers,his tonguehad slid out tourge her lips apart andshe quite forgot what shewould have said as histongue danced with hers.</p> <p>By the time Paen ended the kiss, Avelyn had melted against him, her mind incapable ofholdinga thought.</p><p>\"Ihave sorted it all out,\"he whispered,his mouth moving to herearas he triedto nudge her hands fromwhere they were clutching thelinen to her chest.</p><p>\"That is nice,\"Avelyn breathedon a sigh,turning her headfor him and pressing the side of her face intohis lips like acat under a caress.</p><p>\"Since I cannot use my hands to prepare you, I shall use my mouth,\" he explained. \"But first you shallhave to let go of the linen. \"</p><p>\"Mmm hmm. \" Avelyn smiled. \"Doyou think you could kissme again?\"</p><p>A slow,purely male smile curved his lips as he noted herexpression. \"Do you like itwhenI kiss you?\"</p><p>Despitehaving asked the question, he looked as if he already knew the answer.</p><p>Avelyn didn'tcare. Taking one hand away from the linens, she reached out to slide it into his hair and urgedhishead down foranother kiss. Paen obligedher, thistime starting slow and tender, then deepening it until it became almosta battleto see who could devour theother first. They were both panting when he finally moved his mouthaway and again kissed a trail across her cheek to her ear.</p><p>Ashudder ran through Avelynas his tongue sweptoverand around her earand she turned her head to make iteasier for him, thensuddenly twistedher face backto catch his mouth with her own. Paen obliged her and kissed her again. The sensations hestirred inher made her arch mindlesslyagainst him, responding to herbody's demands. She wantedtobe closer to him, all of her seemedto ache to pressagainst him, and she shifted her bottom forward on the ledgeuntil shewas plasteredagainst him. The momentshe did, Paen brokethekiss andfollowed the length of herthroat withhis lips, forcinghertolean back so that hecould find and nibble atthesensitive hollow ofhercollar bone.</p><p>Avelyn moanedand clutched his shoulders tohelp keep her balance, onlyaware that it left her linen free to drop to herhips when Paen continued hisdownward journeyunimpeded.</p><p>When Paen's lips moved over the slope of her breast to catch one aching nipple inhismouth, Avelyn gasped. Her feet pressed flatagainst the wall as her bottom lifted rightoff the ledge,pressingher more intimately against him. She could feel his hardness rub against her through the linen still covering her lower body. It felt so good, she foundherself again grinding her lowerbodyagainsthis.</p><p>Avelyn thought she heard Paengrowl;thenhe groundback against her and she let her head fall backwith a groan. Thenthecool air touched her still damp nippleand she liftedher head witha shiver, glancing down as he kissed a trail down her stomach that almost seemed tomake those musclesbuckunder her skin. Gasping for breath and feeling off balance as hisshoulders lowered out of herreach, Avelyn clutched at the fur that had covered the window. She didn't seemto have enough breathto protest as he kneltand usedone bandaged handto brush asidethe linen gatheredaround her hips.</p><p>With her very center now revealedtohim, Avelyn opened her mouth ona gasp of protest, then nearly choked ashe urged her legs further apartand pressed hismouth toher.</p><p>\"Dear God!\"Avelyn's hips lifted oftheir own accord, herbottom risingoff the ledge again. She was now a bundle of confusion and sensation. Her mother had nevermentioned this when instructing her aboutthe wedding night. Nor had she mentioned the burning tensionbuildingdeep inside her.</p><p>Avelyn was positive that she would go crazy if Paen didn't stop whatever magic hewasworking. She wasequallypositive that if hedidstop she woulddie. She wanted to close herlegs andstop him, and at the same time to push hisface tighter against her and grind herselfagainst him. Hedidn't stop, and - realizingshe was tugging thoughtlessly at his hair - she pulled that handfree and grabbed atthe fur hanging to the sideof thewindow, pullingon the materialand using it to lift herhips up again untilher body suddenly exploded with the pleasurehe hadbuilt in her.</p><p>Screaming, Avelyn pulled on the furs and threw her headback... just intime to see the fur come tumblingdown over thethem both.</p><p>\"Wife?\"</p><p>Avelyn wasvaguely aware of Paen struggling topush the fur off of them with his bandaged hands; then he was standing between herlegsagain. She threw her arms around him,clutching him close andevenwrapping herlegs around his hips as she pressed her face into hisneck, her bodywracked with shiversand sobs. She felt as if she'd come apart,as ifhe were the only solid thingin the world to hold on to.</p><p>Avelyn felthis arms wrapcarefully around her back as he moved in closer,and she groaned as hishardnesspressedagainst the stillsensitive area betweenher legs.</p><p>Paen groaned too, then suddenly urgedherfaceupandclaimed her lips in akiss.</p><p>Avelyn kissedhim back passionatelyand arched against him. Theybothmoaned as their bodies pushed even closer together. Theaction made herrealize that the pleasure mightnot yetbe over. Then Paen shifted and she felt him nudge against her.</p><p>\"Hold on,\" he whispered, then plunged into her. Avelyn cried out, her body instinctivelyrecoilingandrising upward away from the pain she knew to expect.</p><p>Paen inhaled deeply, forcing himself to remain completely still. He wanted to move. His body was buried deepinher warm heat,and he desperately wantedto move, butheknew he shouldn't For Avelyn's sake it was better if he gaveher a moment to adjust.</p><p>\"Why, that hardlyhurtatall,\"Avelyn saidwith surprise, and Paen pulled back enough to peerdown at her face. Her expression was one of amazement.</p><p>\"Iwas expectingrealpain, butthat wasbarely more thana pinch,\" she explained and smiled widely, then wriggled experimentally against him. \"It does feel odd, though. \"</p><p>Paen ground histeeth together as shewriggled again; then he leaned his forehead againstthe top of her head and breathedslowly in and outto stopfrom pounding in andout of her likehis body wasurging him to do.</p><p>\"Husband?\" she asked suddenly.</p><p>\"Aye?\"he got outbetween clenched teeth.</p><p>\"Isthatall, then? Are wedone?\"</p><p>A short laugh slipped from hislips and he straightened,drawinghimself out ofher as he said, \"Nay. \"</p><p>\"Oh,\" Avelyn gasped. \"That is... er... nice. \"</p><p>She looked perplexed, and then surprised when he plunged back into her.</p><p>\"Oh, thatis... er...\"Shepaused as he withdrew againand murmured another \"Oh. \"</p><p>Recalling hiswife'spenchantfor chatteringonthe ridehere, and fearing she might feela need todo the same while riding him, Paencaughther mouthina kiss as he withdrew again.</p><p>Paen's baser instincts werestillurging him forward, andPaen was still tryingto restrainhimself for hersake. Avelyn didn't appear toappreciate that. Herlegswere wrapped around hiships and her hands clutched at him. Hecould onlycontrolher with hisarms, andthen only cautiously, because he was hesitant tobang his injured hands and allow pain to dampen anyof thisfor him.</p><p>Paen's good intentions died abruptly when his wife suddenly dugher nailsinto his behind, very obviouslyurging him tomove faster. Hegave in to his desire then, drivinghimself into her with quick, hardthrusts, encouraged by Avelyn'smoans into his mouth and the way she wasarchinginto him. Thensuddenly shetore hermouth from his and threw her head back with a scream as shebuckedagainsthim. Paenfelt her squeeze around him, drawing himdeeper into her, then roared with his own release.</p><p>It wasn't until he had collected himself enoughso he could stopleaning on his wifethatPaen glanced over her shoulder atthewindow. The parchment wasopen a crack. Someone must have opened ittoair the room on theirreturn and forgottento closeit. He wondered if anyonehad heardthem. Paen's gazedropped to the bailey, and hestiffened at thesight of the audience below. It looked as if half his father's men were standing staring up at the window,and he found himself grateful that the fire across theroom had burnedlow enough that allthey could possibly seewere shadowy figures. Then one of the men moved forward, separating himself from the restandPaen squinted at the familiar form. it wasn't until the man heldup histhumb in a gesture of approvalthatPaen recognized his father.</p><p>Groaning, he briefly dropped his forehead to his wife's shoulder, then was suddenly gripped by concern that she might glance over her shoulder and realize they had been seen. Knowingthat Avelyn would be terribly embarrassed to realize their first time had notexactly been aprivateaffair, hetightened hisarms aroundher waist and lifted her offthe ledge.</p><p>\"Husband!You will hurt your hands!\" she cried,tightening herarms around his shoulders and knotting her ankles around hisback to keep from being dropped.</p><p>Paen said nothing, but backed away from the window until thebacks of his legs bumped the bed; then he fellback, tumbling themboth on top ofit. Avelyn squealed as they fell,then laughedbreathlessly as he turnedthem on theirsides to face each other. He staredat her, noting that her facewas flushed withcolor, her eyes relaxed and smiling. He was just thinkinghow beautiful she looked when Avelynsuddenly frowned.</p><p>\"What is it?\" Paen asked.</p><p>\"We did not... the linen... it...\" Shepaused, flushing withembarrassment,then managed to get out. \"The linens are usually hung up as proof of the bride's innocence, and so thatall may know the marriagewas consummated, but we did not...\"She let her words trail away and glancedtoward thewindowledge.</p><p>\"Ah. \" He bit his lip. \"Well, Iwould not worry. Ido notthink anyone willdemand proofthat the marriage was consummated. Iam sure they will accept my word for it. \"</p><p>\"But - \" Avelyntriedto protest, but Paensilenced her with a kiss, then slid his arms out from under her and shifted to lie properly on the bed.

After several moments, he sensed her relax againsthim. Whenasoft snore emitted from her, he smiled to himself, finding it utterlycharming. His wife snoredlike a sailor, he thought with something like affection, and pressed a kissto the topof her head. Relaxing into the bed, Paen peered up at the drapes overhead and smiled. He'd managed the consummation and - even withoutthe use of hishands - succeeded in givingher pleasure. Damn, Iwas good, he thought.</p><p>Avelynwoke to a tingling sensation inher rightbreast. Smiling, she murmured sleepily and stretched on herback, her body arching upward into the sensation.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, she found herself staring down at the top of her husband'shead.</p><p>Morning sunlight glinted offhis darkhairas he laved and suckled at her breast.</p><p>Moaning, Avelyn slid herhands intohis hair, scraping her nails lightly across his scalp before letting them drop down torun across his back. He raised his headto peer at her. Realizing she wasawake, Paen shifted upher body, halflying on her as he kissed her good morning.</p> <p>Avelyntook half a moment to worry that herbreath might be unpleasant,then decided that if he didn't mind, shedidn'tmind. It was a delicious wayto wake up, made moreso when he slidone knee between her legs and presseditagainst her.</p><p>Avelyn moaned and archedinto thecaress, her body tingling with eagerness.</p><p>\"Should we move to thewindow ledge?\"shegaspedwhen he shifted over her, resting hiselbows on either side of her head to prevent putting weightonhis hands.</p><p>Paen stilled, then for some reason gavea littlelaughas he shook his head. \"Nay. I think we shall bypass the window this morning. \"</p><p>\"But - \" Avelyn paused and glanced toward thedoorwhen a knock disturbed them.</p><p>\"Who isit?\" Paen growled, still on top of her.</p> <p>\" Tis David,my lord,\" the boy called through the door. \"Yourfathersentmeup tosee ifyou areyet up. He said you were to ride out withhim to Rumsfeldtodayto have alook around. \"</p><p>Paen rolled offof Avelyn with a sigh. \"Aye. I am up. \"</p><p>\"Do you want me to help you dress,mylord?\" Davidaskedthrough the door.</p><p>Paen sat up and reached for the bed linens, then paused at the sight of his bandaged hands.</p><p>Sitting up quickly,Avelyn snatched at the linens and furs and pulled them upto cover themboth,but Paen slid out from under them and stood.</p><p>\"Did you bring myclothes, boy?\" he called as he started across theroom,and Avelyn bit her lipat the sight of hiserect staff.</p><p>\"Aye, my lord,\" came thepromptanswer.</p><p>\"Come in, then. \"</p> <p>Avelyn managed totear her gaze from her husband and tuggedthe linens a little tighter to her chin as the door opened. Shewatched David enter, Paen's clothing, boots andmail piledinhisarms. Themail told her that Rumsfeldwas far enough away that theyhad to guardagainst bandits or attacks. It took a moment before Avelyn recalled where she had heard the name before; then she glanced to her husband, making sure to keepher gazeabove his waist asshe asked, \"Is Rumsfeld not yourmother's birthplace?\"</p><p>\"Aye. Howdidyouknow?\" Paen glanced back at her with surprise as David kicked the door closedwithonefoot, then carried his burdentothe chairbythe fire.</p><p>\"Your mother mentioned it the dayafterwearrived here,\" she murmured. \"She said the chatelain had diedwhile youwereaway. \"</p><p>\"Aye. Legere. He was old. \"</p><p>\"Is that why you are goingthere?Because theoldchatelain is dead?\" Avelyn askedcuriously. \"I suppose yourfather has to arrangefor anew chatelain. \"</p><p>Paen paused besidethechair whereDavid had set his clothesand turned to peer at her, his expression chagrined.</p><p>\"Iforgot to tell you,\" he realized.</p><p>\"Tell me what?\"Avelyn asked asDavid held Paen'sbraes open forhim tostep into.</p><p>Paen waited until his pants were on anddone upbefore answering. \"Fatherasked if I would bechatelain there. \"</p><p>\"What?\"Avelyn asked with surprise asDavid climbed onto the stooland Paen bent at the waist sothe boy couldwork his tunic overhis head. Onceit wasin place, Paen turned to face her with a smile, obviouslyexpectinghertobe pleased.</p><p>\"Aye. He needs someone there he can trust,and he thinks it will give me more experience. \"</p><p>When Avelynstared at him blankly, he explained, \"I have beenawayon Crusade formuch of the lastyears. I am an expert at battle, butcould use somepractice at being lord ofthemanor. \" He knelt to helpDavid get his heavy mailon, then gotto hisfeet andadded, \"He also thought you might be happier if you had a home of your owntotake care of. \"</p><p>Avelyn staredat him as he asked his squire where his belt andsword were. David had left it intheroom Paenusually slept in. Apologizing, the boy hurriedout of the chamber to collect it as Paen moved to the bed. Leaning over, he gave her a quick, passionate kiss, then straightenedandleftthe room, leaving Avelyn staringafter him.</p><p>Paen wastaking over aschatelain atRumsfeld. They would be movingthere. She would have her own household to run.</p><p>Avelyn felt the horror creep over her. Aweekago, she would have thought it was a fine thing and would havelookedforward to beingmistress of her ownhome. Her mother had taken great care toteach her allshe should know for the task. However, that had beenbefore Avelyn hadsomehow fallen under a cloud of calamity. Now, theideahorrified her. She would reduce Rumsfeld torubble within a week withher clumsiness, she supposed miserably.</p><p>\"Rumsfeld is where Lady Christina grew up - 'tis her familyhome. When her parents diedsome years ago, itpassed to her and Lord Gerville. \"</p><p>\"Lady Christina was an only child,\" Lady Helenput in and her niece Diamanda nodded.</p><p>For her part, Avelyn remained silent, simply listening asthe trio walkedupstairs, headed for thesolar.</p><p>Theyhadjust left the hallafter breaking their fast. Paen and his father had already left for Rumsfeld bythe time Avelyn hadtaken careof her morning ablutionsand gonebelow. It hadjust been the four women and several hundred servants and soldiers at thetablesthis morning.</p><p>Of course,thefirst thing out of Lady Gerville'smouth had beenabout the move to Rumsfeld. Itseemed everyone had already knownabout it, including Diamanda andLady Helen. Avelynhadbeenthe last to know.</p><p>She'd learnedat tablethat ithad been decided they shouldwait another weekto go. It was hoped the extra time would give Paen'shands achance tofinish healing.</p><p>Avelyn thus had another week torepack her chests in preparationof moving. Not thatthere was muchto repack. Other than herclothes,nothing had come out of the chestssince the journey. Noneof it had been needed here.</p><p>Lady Gerville hadspoken with forced cheer aboutthe move,and itseemedto Avelyn that Paen's mother was nomore happy about it than she herself was. Even Diamanda and Lady Helen had seemed subdued. Avelyn had been grateful toescape the solarto finish off hernew efforts at atunic and braesfor her husband. She'd started theprojectthe day after their arrival here at Gerville. After wandering the castle aimlessly formostof themorning, she'd decided she might aswellstarton another outfit forPaen. Whilehe still wore a pair of braes and a tunic that had belonged to his brother, they didn't fit as well as they might.</p><p>\"Rumsfeld is quite lovely,\" Diamanda continued as theyreachedthesolar. \"I am sureyou shall like it. \"</p><p>\"You have beenthere?\" Avelynasked curiously as Lady Helenpushed open the door.</p><p>\"Aye. My family traveledby it onourway here when I first came totrainwith LadyChris - !\" Diamanda stopped abruptly and glanced aroundwhen she bumped into her aunt. Lady Helenhad suddenlystoppedinthe doorto the solar, blocking either womanfrom enteringthe room.</p><p>\"Aunt Helen? What is it?\" Diamandashifted past the older womanandpeered into theroom, thengave asoft\"oh\" as Lady Helen suddenly turned and tried to usher Avelyn awayfrom theroom. \"Why dowe not go for a nice walk in the bailey?\"</p><p>\"What?But 'tis raining out,\" Avelyn remindedher,then frowned at her pitying expression and moved past her, determined to see whatever was in theroom.</p><p>\"Mydear, I do not think - \"LadyHelentouched Avelyn's shoulder to stop her, thenfell silent and letherhand fallaway with asigh asAvelyn slippedpast Diamanda andinto theroom.</p><p>Atfirst, Avelyndidn't seeanything unusualor amiss. The roomwas empty except for Boudica andJuno. LadyChristina's pet greyhounds were curled up asleepon top of an old stripof cloth theirmistress had laid out for their comfort.</p><p>Avelyn started to turn backtoward theother twowomen,then pausedand peered back at thebit of cloth sticking outfrom underthe hounds. It was the very same forestgreen as the fabric LadyChristina had given her to sew Paen's new outfit - the remains of the cloththe lady had madehis wedding outfit from.</p><p>\"Avy?\" LadyHelen asked with concern.</p><p>Avelyn crossedtheroom ascarefully as ifshewere walking anarrow tree trunk laid over a river, placing one foot in front of the other, her gazelocked on the cloth.</p><p>When she reached the dogs, she knelt just as carefullyand pluckedatthe cloth, waking the dogs assheslowly pulled it out from beneath them. Boudica andJuno scrambled to their feet and stood watching, tails wagging asAvelyn held up the tunic she'dnearly finishedfor Paen. It was clawedandchewed up. Ruined.</p><p>\"Ohhh. \" It was apainedmoanfrom LadyHelen. \"And after allyour work. Oh, Avelyn. \"</p><p>\"Ishall go fetchLady Gerville,\" Diamanda saidandhurried from the room.</p><p>Avelyn heard the girl hurryoff, but simply sat therestaringatthe ruined remains of Paen's top. She could hardly believe it. She couldn'tbelieve it. Her stunned mind was floating uselessin her head, unabletograsp this latestcatastrophe.</p><p>A whine sounded, then Boudica's wet tongue brushed up her cheek. Avelyn blinked her eyes back into focus and peered at the animal even as Juno moved closer togive her awet swipe on her cheek aswell. An apology? Comfort?</p><p>Boudicagave another whine,followed by another lick as if begginghernot to hurt them. Avelyn smiledfaintly at the thought. As if she could hurt the sillycreatures. A long sighslid fromher, taking all the tensionfrom her bodywith it. She dropped the cloth to pet them both reassuringly.</p><p>\"'Tisall right,\"shetoldthe animals,finding herself soothed by the feel of their soft furas she petted them.</p><p>\"Butall yourhard work,\" Lady Helensaid.</p><p>\" 'Twasjust atunic,\" Avelyn murmured.</p><p>Lady Gerville had suggested the fatesmight be acting against her. Avelyn was beginning to believe it. If that werethe case, she hadtwo choices - to give upand stop trying to do anything, or to make the best of the situation and keep onplugging untilthe fates tired of toying with her.</p><p>Avelyn wasnot thesort to give up.</p><p>\"Avelyn?\"</p><p>She lifted her headas Lady Gerville moved slowlyinto the roomto stand beside Lady Helen. She was a little out ofbreath, sohad obviouslyhurriedup here, but nowshe was moving slowly, almost cautiously, uncertainty on her face. Avelyn supposed Diamanda had told her what hadhappenedand the woman feared her reactiontowhatthe dogs had done.</p><p>\"I - \" Paen'smother began, \" 'Tis all right,\" Avelyn interrupted her. She ruffled the fur of both Juno and Boudica one last time, thenpicked up thescrapof cloththat used to be a lovely tunic and got to herfeet. \"I fearwe shall need more cloth, though. I hopethefabric merchant is expected to comearound soon. \"</p><p>\"I shallsend a man out to hunt him up,\" Lady Gervillesaid, eyeingher with concern.</p><p>Avelyn supposed that because of the way she'dfallenapart after the firehad destroyed her first efforts,Lady Gerville was unsure what to expect this time. But that had been an unusual reaction from Avelyn, a result of exhaustion, she suspected. She hadn't sleptmuchinthe days before that disaster. Besides, ithad been one of many catastrophes over a short span of time. This was the first untoward event in thethree days sincearrivinghere. She wasn't goingtofall apart.</p><p>Patting thelady'sarm as shewalked past her, Avelyn said, \"I think I shallgosee if there is enough ivorycloth left to make a tunic. \"</p><p>Avelyn slipped from the roomand walked to her own, the cloth clutchedinher hand. She could usethedestroyedgarment to measure the ivory cloth, andslung it over hershoulderasshe kneltat herchest,onlyto pause and sniff the air. She smelled... Avelyn sniffedagain, turning her head towardthe tunichangingoverher shoulder. Pork. Shelifted thegarment topress it to her face to besure. The tunic smelled of pork.</p><p>Avelyn sat backand staredat the garment. They'dhad porkfor dinner the night before, but she had no ideahow thescentcould have got on the tunic. Avelyn hadn't sewnafter the meal last night. She'd gone totalk to Paen instead, andthen... well, she certainly hadn't even thought ofsewingafter Paen had come to theroom.</p><p>She fingered the material. With the tunic smelling as itdid,it wasno wonder the dogshad gone after it. But how haditendedup smelling ofpork? Ithad to have been doneby someone else, but who?Justtouching it with grimy fingers wouldn't have done it. The clothwas saturated with the scent, as if the meathad been rubbed across it.</p><p>It was the second outfit Avelynhad been making for Paen thathad beenruined.</p><p>Thefirstinthe fireand now this. She shook herhead atthe suddenthoughtthat struck her. Surelysomeonewasn'tsabotaging her efforts?Avelyn couldn'tbelieve it.</p><p>But she truly had thought she'd blown that candle out in the tent. And nowthepork smell. Onthe other hand,she had beenincredibly accident proneof late, and it was possible she hadn't blown the candle out after all.</p><p>She wasbeing silly,Avelyn decided. Perhapsthesmellof pork hadgottenon the tunicaccidentally... though she couldn't see how that could happen. Still, it just couldn't have been done deliberately. Everyonewas so nicetoher. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Avelyn folded the tunic andput it inthechest on top of the ivorycloth, thinking that perhapsit wasa good thingthat sheand Paen were going to Rumsfeld.

Just to be safe.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\"Diamanda, I may havea faulty memory,but Iam sure you said Rumsfeld was quite lovely,\" Avelyn said weakly asthey rode close enoughto see the crumbling walls.</p> <p>\"Aye. \" The younger woman shook herhead helplessly, herown gaze lockedon the castle ahead. \"It was when I saw it. \"</p><p>\"How old were you?\"</p><p>\"Six,\" she admitted.</p><p>\"Isee. \" Avelyn let her breathout on a sigh, then triedfor an expression shehoped was serene as her husband slowed his horse to fallback next to them.</p><p>it was a week since the morningAvelynhad discovered Lady Gerville's dogs sleeping on the ruined tunic. A perfectly peaceful, calamity-free week. Avelynhad come to the conclusion that her brief concern that someone might be trying to sabotage her efforts had just been too much imagination. Nothing had happened since then.</p> <p>Actually,nothingat all hadhappened during the last week. Ithad been astring of boring days and boringevenings. Paen had ridden out withhisfather to Rumsfeld first thing every morning. Thecastlewas a half-day travel away, and bythetime the two men had returned eachnight,it wasquite late. Avelyn wasoften asleepwhen Paen returned. If not, she was assoon as he collapsed into bed exhausted and began tosnore.</p><p>Paen hadnotbeddedAvelynagain sincethe night they hadconsummated the wedding - muchtoherdisappointment - and she was once again fighting offthe fear thatit waspurely outof a lack of desire to doso. She tried totell herself that he was justtired,but it wasas if her three cousins had made a place forthemselvesinher head, for Avelyn could heartheir voices claiming thathehad only approachedher the first time out of duty and now could not bear to bebothered with herplump body again. When those voices arose, she pushed them away and told herselfto wait until they were at Rumsfeld to see what would happen. SoAvelyn had waited.</p><p>In themeantime, she hadlearnedfrom Lady Gerville that there hadbeen some trouble with reavers at Rumsfeld over theyears. Scottish raiders had crossed the nearbyborderto stealanimals and harass the people of the area. It seemed thaton one or two occasions, they had attacked the castle itself. This last point, Lady Gerville claimed, was the thing thatupset Lord Gerville themost, for his chatelain, Legere,hadnever informed him of these problems. Instead, he'd chosen todealwith them on his own, much to thedetriment of the castle andits people. Apparently, there was a great deal to do, and Paenand his father had been rushingto get all in readiness for Avelyn and Paen to move there.</p><p>Avelyn peered at the holes in the outer wall of Rumsfeld with concern. Theholes were clearly the result of attacks. Most of them weresmall, and there was evidence that several much largerholes had been repaired. In some areas,whole sections of the wall had obviously been recentlyrebuilt. She had no doubt thatrepairing the walls was one of the chores her husband andhis father hadbeen seeing to this last week. Neither man would havebeenwillingtobring theirwives to an unsafe castle.</p><p>\"Rumsfeld is notthe home it oncewas,\" Paensaidonce his mount was alongside her.</p><p>Avelyn noddedat her husband's words, butmanaged nottocomment.</p> <p>\"It was Mother's childhood home. \"</p><p>Avelyn glanced to where Lady Gervillerodenext to her husband. Paen's mother had decidedto accompanythemto Rumsfeld,so of courseDiamanda and Lady Helenhad joinedthepartyas well. Realizing thather husband was waiting for some sort of response,Avelyn nodded.</p><p>\"She willbe upsetwhenshe sees what time and troublehave done to it. \"</p><p>When Avelyn nodded again,Paen grunted withsatisfaction and urged his horse back up beside his father's. She stared after him, rather bewildered as towhat she was supposedtounderstand fromtheir briefconversation. She'dthought at firstthat he meantto warn or soothe her. Perhaps hewished her tohelp hismother over any upset thewoman might experience when they arrived.</p><p>Avelyn would be more thanpleased to cheer and comforther new mother-in-law if the situation arose. The womanhad been kindness itself to her. However, if it was whatPaen wanted,she wished he'd simply saidso. Honestly,mencould be the most unforthcoming of creatures.</p><p>Shaking her head, she remained silent for the remainderofthe journey, paying more attention to Lady Gerville thanthe bailey itself asthey rode through it to the steps of the keep. Paen'smother boreup wellat first, though her back did grow straighter with each stepthehorses took,her neck stretchingand head rising higher and higheruntil Avelyn thought itmight snap. Still, those were the only outward signs ofherupset.</p><p>Theydismountedat the steps of the keep. Paen and his father took the horsesby the reins and begantolead themtoward what shesupposed must be the stables, but the building was sofullof holes, it was a wonderthatit wasstill standing.</p><p>No one commented on the fact that noone wasthereto take the animals, but Avelyn saw Lady Gerville's fingerstightenwhere she had themclaspedinfront of her. Aftera pause, the lady straightened her shoulders andled thewomen up the stairstothe keep.</p> <p>It waswhen they stepped through the open large double doors and saw the state of theinterior that LadyGerville finally lost someof her composure.</p><p>Her eyes widened, her shoulders drooped, anda soft \"oh\" ofdismay andpain slipped fromhermouth, which remained openafter the sounddied.</p><p>Avelyn immediately took her arm lest shegrow faint. Her touchspurred Lady Gerville to speak. \"This is... thisis - \"</p><p>\"Easilyfixedwith a little effort,\" Avelyn finished firmly, garnering adisbelieving look from Diamanda.</p><p>Fortunately, Lady Helen was more helpful, murmuring an agreement as they movedtoward thetrestle table in the centerof thehall.</p><p>\"Oh, Avelyn,\" Lady Gerville sighed, then turned large eyes on her. \"Truly Ihad not realized... You cannot stayhere. This is - \"</p><p>\"It will be fine,\" Avelyn assuredher, doing her bestto ignore her own dismay at thestateof the place. The floor wascovered with a scanty carpetof rushes so old there were plants and - worse - molds growing in them. The walls wereblackened and soot-stainedas ifthey had never beenwhitewashed,though Avelyn wassure theymust havebeenwhile Lady Gervillehadlivedhere. Thestairs to the upper floor were in a terrible stateof disrepair,with steps missing in places. There were also great large holes - some the size of beds - in the wooden floors of the rooms overhead.</p><p>\"My poor home,\"Lady Gerville murmured as she sank onto the table bench under Avelyn'surging,andtumbled to thefloor when it collapsed beneath her.</p><p>\"Are youall right?\" Avelyn askedwith alarm assheand Lady Helenhelpedher back to her feet.</p><p>\"Yes, thank you,\" Lady Gerville murmured as the women all proceededto brush at the dust and dirtherfall had collected.</p><p>\"My skirtis fine, itwill wash,\"Lady Gerville said withasign when it became obvious their effortswereuseless. Shethenturnedtostareforlornly around the great hall, onlytopauseandblink. \"Is that a pig?\"</p><p>Avelyn followed her gaze, herown eyes widening as she stared at the largesow rooting in thefilthy rushes in a corner. Asthey watched, thebeast pawedat the rushesseveral times, then dropped ontoits side with a huff, apparently ready to sleep outof themiddayheat.</p><p>\"I believe it is,\"Avelyn said faintly, at a loss as to howto react. She knew many peoplekept theiranimals inside the keep at nightto keepthem safeand warm, but hermother hadn't been one ofthose people, and - aside from her dogs - neither was Lady Gerville. However, Avelynhadn't a clue what to do about the beast.</p><p>\"Your mother is bearing up betterthan I hadhoped. I tried to talkher out of coming today, you know,\"Wimarc Gervillecommented as heand Paen finished withthe horses and startedback toward the keep.</p><p>\"Did you?\" Paen asked.</p><p>\"Aye. Idid not wish her to see her childhood home likethis, but she's astubborn woman, your mother. Nothing would talk her out of coming to seethe twoof you settled in. \" He grimaced. \"Now I worryshe will tryto insist on stayinguntil itis set torights, orthatthe twoof you should not stay until it isbetter prepared. \"</p><p>Paennearly groaned at the idea. The last week of traveling back andforthhad been exhausting, butwhilethewalls of Rumsfeld hadto be repaired tomake it safe to bring Avelyn over, he hadn't been willing tostayhere by himself. The lure of his marriage bed had called himhome each night, and he had returned only to find himself tooexhausted to enjoyit.</p><p>Hepeereddownat his handsand squeezedthem shut. His motherhad removed the last of the bandagesthatmorning, and while the skinfelt tight whenhe closed his hands into fists, he was wellpleased with their shape. They werea tad sensitiveand were not fullyhealed, but would do. He couldn't wait to touch Avelyn with them, andplanned to doso that verynight. Having only journeyedone way this time, Paen wassure the exhaustion that had been plaguinghim this last weekwould not be a problem and he wouldfinally beable to enjoyhis sweet, gentle wife again.</p><p>\"What the devil!\"</p><p>His father's startled exclamation made Paen glance toward thekeep. Bothmen stopped walking astheytook in thestruggle takingplaceat the top ofthe keep stairs.</p><p>Paen's sweet, gentle wife, her maid and his usually dignifiedmother were yellingand shrieking and pushinga ratherlarge sowout of the castle. The three womenwere positionedat the back of the large, obviouslypregnant animal, bentover, handson the generous hindquartersas they shoved and pushed andtried toforce her through the frontdoor of the keep.</p><p>Diamanda and her auntwere also there. With no room leftat the back of the beast, theauntstooda safedistance away with a dubious expression. Diamanda was jumping about, clapping herhands and yelling\"shoo!\" at the top of herlungs as if she thought the louder she yelled, the more likely the animal would hear and understand her.</p><p>Heaving his breath out, Paen started forward again. \"Iguess we had best seeto this ere they get themselves bit. Dotheynot know that pigs have teeth?\"</p><p>\"Thequestion is,does the pig know your motherdoes?\" WimarcGervilleasked withamusementas he followed.</p><p>The two men reached the womenbefore thepig got too annoyed. Paen calmly used anapple to lead the beastdownthestairs, while his father ushered the excited women inside. The five of them were standing by the trestle table when Paen returned, his father shaking his head unhappily as Lady Gerville insisted, \"They simply cannot stayhere, Wimarc. \"</p><p>\" 'Twillbe fine,mylady,\" Avelyn said, but Lady Helen shookherheadand added hersupport to Lady Gerville.</p><p>\"Your wifeis right,my lord. Avelyn is a gentlybred lady,a noblewoman. You cannot expect thepoor child to stay in this rubble. \"</p><p>\"Weare staying,\" Paen said firmly as hewalked up to them.</p><p>Hismother turned a displeased scowl his way, but - despite his helplessness the last two weeks - Paen wasnot a child. He refused to back down. \"We will have this placecleaned up and in proper order in no time now that Avelyn is hereto direct the servants. She can tendto the inside, while I see to the outside ofourhome. By the timeyou return fora visit, it will bein good shape. \"</p><p>\"I agreewith the boy,Christina,\" Lord Gerville said. \"This is tobe their home now, andtherepairswill gomuch more quickly if theyarehere full-time ratherthan wasting somany hoursriding backandforth to Gerville everyday. \"</p><p>\"Fine,\" Lady Gervillesaid abruptly. \"Then Ishall stay as well, to help. \"</p><p>\"Christina,\" Lord Gerville chided. \"Do you stay,youwill simply takeover the task asyou wouldat home. 'Tis the girl's home. Let her tend itas she seesfit. \"</p><p>\"But...\"LadyGerville peered around attheruin. \"Thereis so much to get done beforethey willbe near comfortable. Help would make it allgo so much more quickly. \"</p><p>\"Icould stay to help,\" Diamanda offered.</p><p>\"That is a fine idea,\" Paen said, then shruggedwhen everyoneturned tostare at him. \"She can help out, and be companyfor Avelynas well. If Lady Helen willallow it,\" he added. Diamanda'sauntpursedherlips,thennodded.</p><p>\"Certainlywe can stay. It will be useful for Diamanda. After helping here, she will bemorethan capableof handlingany emergencya noblewoman might encounter,\"</p><p>Lady Helen said dryly.</p><p>\"But - \" LadyGerville began, even as Avelynprotested, \"Oh, that really isn't necessary. \" They were both overridden by Paen's father.</p><p>\"Thatsounds aperfect solution. We shall send your things fromGerville when we return,and return ourselvesin a week to collect you ladies and bring you back.</p><p>However, if you change your mindat any timeand wish to return toGerville before that, you are welcomeandPaen will supply anescort. \"He waited for both womento nod, then clapped his hands. \"Good, good. Well, we mayas well head out home thenand leaveyou to gather your servants for the task ahead. We'vea longjourney back. \"</p><p>\"But, Wimarc, wejust gothere,\" LadyGerville protested.</p><p>\"I told you I did notplan to stay long and you shouldnottroubleyourselfto come,\" he pointed out. \"I onlywished to besurethe last section ofwall was finished this morning as ordered. It had to be done ere Avelyn and Paencould stay here. \"</p><p>\"Aye, but - \"</p><p>\"I had Selypack apicnic for us to enjoy onthe return trip,\"LordGervillewent on. \"Let usgosothechildren can start setting things torights here. They shallwant much doneere nightfall so that they cansleep comfortably. \"</p><p>Paen held hisbreath,surehis mother would protest further, butshe gave in with a sigh.</p><p>\"Good!\" He patted her arm. \"I shall leave you to find out what the ladies wish sent fromGerville, and to say yourgood-byes, while Ihave awordwithPaen. \"</p><p>Paen walked outside with his father,noddingas theolder man gavesuggestions and advice onwhat to seeto next. Apparently,whileLord Gerville thoughthislady wife should not give advice to Avelynon running the household, he was not of the same opinionwhenit came to hisson. Paen didn't mind,though. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Theywerejust winding up their talk when the womenfinally made their way out of the castle. Paen hadno idea what the women had been discussing inside. He was sure that Lady Helen andDiamanda had given his mothera long list of thingsthey wishedsent on, and he doubtedverymuch if hismotherhad managed to avoid giving some instruction to Avelyn. It was second nature to her after training Diamanda for so long. However, he didn't know what was responsible for the red-eyed, sniffling state of the women.</p><p>\"Women,\" his fathersighedhis exasperation as thewomen approached. \"You would think we were going to bethreedays' travel apartrather than halfaday's journey. \"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Paen agreed.</p> <p>\"Come along, wife. They will not be far away,\" Lord Gerville said when the women paused at the bottom of the stairs to embrace eachother in a tearful tableau.</p><p>Reluctantly stepping away,LadyGerville movedto give Paen a hug, holdinghim so tightly he feared shewould crack a rib ere she lethim go. \"Take care of her, son.</p><p>She's a very sweet girl. \"</p><p>Paen nodded, though he wasn't surewhomshe was referring to. His first instinct was thatshe meant Avelyn, buthedid not tothink of his wifeas a girl. Diamanda was a girl. Paen's wife was allwoman.</p><p>\"Christina,\" Wimarc saidin long-suffering tones.</p> <p>\"Men,\" his mother muttered, but finallyreleased Paen andmoved to mounther horse.</p><p>\"We shallvisit in a week's timeand see how things are going,\" Lord Gerville announced as he too mounted. \"Send a messenger ifyou haveany trouble. \"</p><p>Paen nodded, thenwatchedhis parents ride out of the bailey, withtheir menand Lady Gerville's maid following. The momenttheywereout ofthebailey and heading forthehill,Paen turned toglance atthewomenat the base of the steps. Theywere staring afterthe small traveling partyas ifwatching theirvery last friend rideaway.</p><p>Shaking hishead, Paincleared his throat todraw their attention. \"I shall leave the servants andkeep to youwhile I see about matters out here. Come find me if you needme. \"</p><p>\"Aye, husband,\" Avelyn murmuredandeven managed a smile.</p><p>Paen gruntedhis satisfaction and turned tocross the baileyto where severalmen wererepairing thesmaller holes in the wall. Rumsfeld had been interribleshapewhen Paen and his father had cometoinspect things aweek earlier.</p> <p>Legere had run the castle since Paen's grandfather's death, shortly after his parentshad married. While hisparentshad made visits tothecastle when he was a boy, Paencouldn't recall them returningthere in the lastten years at least. Ithadbeen a mistake hisfather bitterly regretted when he'd seen the dilapidatedstate oftheplace last week. Legere had been no young man when he'd first taken up the role of chatelain,but he had been very old by thetime of his death, obviously too oldto take care ofthe castle properly, and too stubborn to admit it.</p><p>Paen'sfather was apparently the only person in thearea who hadn't known the manwas no longer up to thetask ofrunningRumsfeld. Certainly, the Scots whohad stolen allthecattle and repeatedly attacked thecastle had been aware of it. They'd carriedawayeverything ofvaluethat wasn't nailed down,including partsof the wall itself.</p><p>Allthat had been leftwhen Paen and his fatherfirstarrived toinspectthe castle was a broken wall,a shell of a keep with rotten wood everywhere, abandof tatty servants, fifty poorlydressed soldiers and a couple of pigs and chickens.</p><p>The first problem Paen hadencountered wasthe soldiers. The men had been surly and resentful that their lord had neglected them so by leavingthem to an incompetentchatelain and never troubling himself to checkonthem.</p><p>It had taken Paen the better part oftwo days toassure the men that things would now change for thebetter. it was onlythen that he'd managed togetmuch work out of them, but they'd worked hard since, and thingswere coming along nicely. The extra men his father had brought from Gervillehelped too, and if thingscontinued as they were, he expected to have Rumsfeld backto its original state by autumn. At leastthe outside. He needed to finish repairing thewalls andbuild new stables, a blacksmith's hut, a cobbler's and othercritical structures. Healso needed to find goodpeople to fill the positions. The skilled men had fled long ago,taking their skills where they wouldbe better appreciated.</p><p>Paenwashoping that Avelyn would have the inside of thekeep inshape long before that. Her job should be easy compared to his, he thought ashereached the menworking on the wall and joined them in the endeavor. It was mostly a matter of cleaning, and hedoubted the servantswould be asresentful and hard to deal with as the soldiers had been.</p><p>He was ratherproud of her reactionto the keep's sorry state. His father hadbeen positive she would be upset,butPaenhad guessed otherwise. In his experience, nothingmade a woman happier than setting things torights,and there was plenty for hertoset to rightshere.</p><p>Aye, he thought, Avelyn would havethe keep shipshapeinno time. No doubt, right that moment she had an army of servantscleaning like mad.</p> <p>\"Husband?\"</p><p>Paen turnedfrom the wall to watchhiswife approach. Hefound himself licking his lips as her hips swayed and her breasts jiggled as she walked. Hehad high hopes forbeing able to bed her tonight. Without the return journey to wear him out, Paen expectednot to drop into exhausted sleep themoment he lay down.</p><p>\"Husband? Did youhear me?\" Avelyn asked, andPaenfrowned as he realized that she'dbeen speaking andhe'd beentoobusy anticipating the evening aheadto hearher.</p><p>\"No,\" headmitted. \"What didyou say?\"</p><p>\"Isaid I have lost theservants. \"</p><p>Paenstared. And stared. Then, sure he'dheard herwrong,he asked, \"Excuse me?\"</p><p>\"Well, Ihave notreallylostthem. I simplycannotfind them,\" Avelynsaid. \"They are neither in the hallnor the kitchen,andI have no idea where else to look. \"</p><p>\"Haveyou tried above stairs?\" Paen asked.</p><p>Avelyn stared at her husband blankly. \"They could not possibly be upstairs, husband. The steps are broken. \"</p><p>\"Only three orfour of them,\" he pointed out. \"Otherwise theyaresoundenough.</p><p>Father and I used them the first day we came here. The servants are probably upstairs preparing the rooms for thenight. \"</p><p>\"Oh. \" Avelyn shifted from one foot to the other, then sighed and murmured dubiously, \"I shallcheck above stairs. \"</p><p>Leaving himto his work,Avelyn returned to thekeep. Shequickly came upon Runilda, whowas digging through the items on the back of the cart. The maid was in search of cleaning equipment, something they hadnotseen much of in the castle whenthey'd gone to find theservants. Avelynlefthertoherchore and walkedup the stairsandinto thehall.</p><p>\"Where is Lady Helen?\" she asked Diamanda. The girl stood staring at the remains of the benchthathadcollapsedbeneath Lady Gerville.</p><p>\"She wentto see if there is an herb garden behind the kitchens. She said she expects that if there is it will have grown wild, buthopes itmaybe salvageable. \"</p><p>Avelyn nodded. She hadn'tevenconsideredthat issue yet,but a garden and the herbs andmedicinal plants it provided couldbe as indispensable as a well. The thought made her say, \"Iwonder where the wellis. Thereshouldbeone. Even if the original were contaminated,Paen and his father would havehada newonedug. \"</p><p>\"Aye, and we shall need water to clean with. \" Diamanda glancedtoward the door.</p><p>\"Shall Igoask him?\"</p><p>\"Would you mind?I needs mustcheck upstairsfor the servants. \"</p><p>Diamanda's eyes widened incredulously. \"Why? Itisnotsafe, and they cannot possiblybe up there. \"</p><p>\"Aye, well,I donot think so either, but Paen suggestedthey may beup there preparing the rooms. \"</p><p>Diamandasnorted at the idea.</p><p>Avelyn smiled slightly. \"Please go check with Paen on wherethe well is and I shall look for theservants. \"</p><p>Diamandahesitated. \"Well, be careful. Those stairs do notlook atall safe. \"</p><p>\"Nor doesthe floorupthere,\" sheacknowledged. \"Ishall be careful. \"</p><p>She waited until Diamanda had headedfor the door,thenstarted cautiouslyup the stairs, gripping the rail when therewas one. She retained a clear image of the bench collapsing beneathLadyGerville,and with her ownrecentrecordof accidentsand calamities,wasnot all thatconfident she was going to master thestairs without at least scraping a knee.</p><p>Avelyn grimaced atthethought and wonderedwhy she was even botheringwith this task. In truth,she thought ita fool's errand. However, Paenseemed to think the servantswould be found upthere, busily preparing the upperrooms, andso she wouldcheck. it was hard to believethey would be busily working away in the bed chambers when they obviously had notlifted a finger to make any preparations in the great hall... or the kitchens, forthatmatter.</p><p>If the great hallwas bad, the kitchens were worse. There the floors and counters and tableswere just as neglected as the hall,but alsocoated with layers ofgrease and smoke. Avelyn's slippers hadstuck to the floor and she'dbeen afraid to touch anything.</p><p>Avelyn hadnearlymadeit tothe top of the stairs when the step she was on creaked ominously. She leapt back, nearlyfalling through the missing stairshe'd just steppedover. She landedon one knee on the edgeof the brokenstep, the other leg dangling intospacethrough the hole and bothhands on therailing.</p><p>\"Soundenough,\" shemuttered herhusband's words to herself assheheld onto the rail with a deathgrip and pulledherleg back up through the hole. She didn't have to lookat herleg toknow she'dscraped itnicely. The burning painin her shin told heras much. Gritting her teeth against thepain, she gotshakilyback to her feet.</p><p>Avelyn leaned against the wall briefly andconsideredturning back,but therewere only acoupleof stairs leftafter themissing step. Slowlyletting her breath out, she forced herselftostraightenandcontinued up, this time being sure to keep her foot as close tothe wall aspossible asshebypassed the missing step. She was sure the woodclosest to thewall would bethe least likelytogive outonher.</p><p>Much to herrelief, there wasno creakthis time and she continued safely up the last fewsteps. On the landing, she releaseda relieved breath, then paused to lifther skirt and look at her legs.</p><p>Aye, she'd done afinejob on her shin, she thoughtwithdisgust as she let the skirt drop back into place. She could only hope the trip back down would be less eventful.</p><p>Nowthat she was above stairs, Avelynrealized that she should have brought a torch withher. While the open doors allowed light into the great hall, thehallways were much darker. Avelyneased forward, feeling herway carefully withher foot.</p><p>From belowshe had been able to see the great holes inthe woodenfloor and hadno desire to step into one.</p><p>Avelyn checked eachof thethree rooms on the second floor. The firstroom was the biggest, and shesupposed it was the one Legerehadused. Ifso, either he hadn't owned much,orhis possessions had been stolen after he died. The room held nothing but a rickety old bed. The next two rooms, however, had nothing at all.</p><p>They weren't even furnished andboth had at least two holesinthe floor. The last room had the biggest hole, though it wasn't quiteasbig as she'd thought. Avelyn doubted abed wouldfitthrough it.</p><p>She stopped afew feet fromthehole and leaned forwardto peer through it. The great hall below looked no betterfrom thehighervantagepoint. Therushesreally werein a shameful state. Theentire castlewas.</p><p>Shaking her head,shestarted to back away from the hole, thenpausedwhen a creak soundedbehindher. Shehad half turned whenwhat felt like a plank ofwood slammed intothe side of her face. Avelyn stumbled under theblow, fallingsideways.</p><p>That wasprobably what saved her. She reached instinctivelyforthefloor as she fell, but while herrighthand slappeditwith a stinging impact, her left hand found onlyopen air. Then her headslammed into a broken bit of wood and darkness rushed to claim her as shefelt herselffallingthrough the hole she'd beenlooking through.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The first thingAvelyn noticed on waking was thather headwaspounding. She didn'tthink she'd everexperiencedsuch painand squeezed her eyestightlyshut in reaction, but that only seemedtomakeit worse.</p><p>\"Avy?\"</p><p>Recognizing Diamanda's voice, Aveylnforced her eyesopen and peered up at the girl with confusion. She staredat the prettyblonde's anxiousface, thenlether gaze driftpasthertothe cloth overhead and all aroundthem.</p><p>\"Thetravelingtent. \" Her voice wasa huskywhisperand shelicked her lips,then swallowed beforetrying again. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"Paen hadthe men set it up so that we would have someplace to put you,\"</p><p>Diamanda explained. \"Youhit your head pretty badlywhenyou fell. \"</p><p>\"Fell,\" Avelyn echoed with confusion; then her heart jumped as she recalled standing in the upperroom,being hit, fallingforward andher left hand findingno purchaseas it went through theholein the floor. Shealso now remembered herhead slamming intowhat hadfelt like broken wood. Theedge of the hole, she thought.</p><p>Then she'd realizedshe wasfalling through the hole.</p><p>\"Someonehit me,\" Avelynsaid. \"I fell throughthe hole. \"</p><p>\"Hityou?\" Diamandashook her head. \"Paen saidyou must have hit your headon the side of thehole. Your face was scraped, and there was blood on the planks upstairs. \"</p><p>\"No, someonehitme,\" Avelyn insisted weakly, thenglanced toher other side as Lady Helen patted her hand and leaned forward.</p><p>\"It musthavebeen a dream,dear. You were alone above stairs. \" Shegave her a reproving look. \"You never should have gone up there in thefirst place. You are fortunateyou didnot fall down the stairs andbreak your neck. Asit is, if it weren't for your skirt catching on the edge of a brokenplank, you would have certainlyfallen toyour deathwhenyou stumbled throughthe hole. \"</p><p>\"My skirt?\"Avelyn asked.</p><p>\"Aye,my lady. \" Runildastepped closerto the bed, peering at her over Lady Helen'sshoulder. \"I was cominginto thehallwith buckets and abroom when you fellthrough the hole. \" Themaid pressed ahand to herchest as if the very memory made her heart flutter. \"Youfell severalfeet, butyourskirt caught on somethingand you jerked to astop and just dangledthere, hangingbyyourskirt like a doll made of rags. \" Runilda bit her lip and shook her head. \"I juststoodthere screaming. \" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Iheard her screaming and came running,\" Diamanda said.</p><p>\"Asdid I. \" Lady Helen shuddered delicately. \"I never want to heara scream like thatagain.

He lifted you with one hand. He just knelt at the side of the hole, reached down, caught your skirt and lifted youright up. Then hecarriedyou below and started bellowing orders tothe men. \"</p><p>\"The men?\" Avelynpeered at her with confusion.</p><p>\"Aye. Well, when Runilda went running down to fetchPaen, the men hurried back with him,\" Diamanda informedher. \"They alljustfrozeinthe hall staring up at you fora minute, even Paen. They were allhorror-struck, of course; then Paensent the men to fetch the tent cloth and they heldit out tight beneath youinthe hall, in case you fellbefore he could pull you up. \"</p><p>\"Of course, by the time they had thematerial stretched outbeneath you, Paenhad alreadyreached youand was pulling you up\"Helen said. \"Once he'dcarried you downstairs, he orderedthemen to set up the tent out infront ofthekeep so that he would have someplace to layyou whileyou recovered. \"</p><p>\"Aye,my lady. Your husbandwas so concerned, he held you thewholetime while the men setup the tent,\" Runilda told her with a smile. Avelynwas just feeling herheart thrill atherhusband'spublic showof affection when Diamanda spokeup.</p> <p>\"Well, of course he did. There was nowhere to set her down untilthetent wasup andwe'darranged thefurs inside,\" the girl said practically.</p><p>\"We should let Avelyn rest,\" Lady Helen saidwith a frownatDiamanda as the small smile that had started on Avelyn's facedied aquick death. \"We should go see how themenare getting on. \"</p><p>\"The men?\" Avelynaskedas Diamanda'sauntstood.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Diamanda answered. \"Paen set someof them tofixingthe stairs and the floor on the upper level. The rest are removing the oldrushes fromthegreat hall so thatit may be scrubbed. \"</p><p>\"Isee,\" Avelyn whispered.</p><p>\"Do not fear,\"theyounger girl said as shegot to herfeet. \"Youneed not see the mentoday. Rest and recover - wewill overseethem. \"</p><p>\"Why would Inot wishtosee themen?\"Avelyn asked with bewilderment.</p><p>\"Well...\" The petiteblonde looked nonplused foramoment, thensaid, \"I just thought you may be too embarrassed aftereverything. \"</p> <p>\"Everything?\" Avelyn asked, feelingdread well in her. \"What everything?\"</p><p>\"I thought you mightbeembarrassedthat they had allseen...\" She paused as if just realizingthatAvelyn didn'tknow.</p><p>\"Come, lether rest; there is noneed for her to know. \" When Lady Helen tugged at Diamanda's arm, the girl followedherquickly outof thetent.</p><p>Avelyn turned her gazetoRunilda. \"There isnoneedfor me to know what? What did all the men see?\"</p><p>Themaid sighedunhappily, but knew her mistress well. Avelynwouldrequire an answer.</p><p>\"You weremostlyupright, hanging by the back ofyour skirt, my lady,\" Runilda explained with discomfort and gestured behind herself.</p><p>Avelyn staredat her with dawning horror. \"Was all revealed?\"</p><p>\"Nay,\" themaid hurried to reassure her. \"The skirt caughtunderyourarms at the sidesand draped over... er... well it was above your kneesinfront. Well above,\"</p><p>\"And the back?\" Avelyn asked. Runilda's expression was answer enough. It seemed - like theday Paen had thought she'ddrowned - the men had once again gotten agoodlook atherbackside. \"My husband must thinkme such apickle. \"</p><p>\"Oh, nay,my lady. \" Runilda knelt at her side andsqueezedher hand. \"Truly, he wentwhitewhenhe saw you werein peril, and he would notput youdownonce he hadyou in his arms. He held you for ever solong, just staringat you with concern. I think he isgrowing to care foryou. \"</p><p>Avelyn found that hard to believe. She was not exactly the perfect wife. In fact, she would guess thatto Paen she was something of a nightmare. Too tired to once again make a mental listing of all theinjuriesand accidents she'dcausedorbeen involvedwithsince her wedding day,Avelyn simply asked,\"Where is my husband?\"</p><p>\"After heassured himself youwouldrecover, he set the men to work, then rode out forthe village. I believe heis going to seeabout servants. \"</p><p>Avelyn grimaced atthisnews. Paen was supposed to tend tothe outside of the keepwhile she tendedtothe inside. Once again her clumsiness had simply laid more of aburden onPaen. Her husbandmay not have beeninjured this time, ashehad when his hands had gottenburned in thefire she'd started, but the chores he was tending to were supposed to beherresponsibility.</p><p>Well, she would not allowthat. It wastoo late to stop him from going to the village in searchof servants,but she couldatleast oversee themen while he was gone. Avelyn started to rise, pausing half upright on the furs when pain rushed through her and nausea followed.</p><p>\"Please,my lady. \" Runilda was immediatelypushing at her shoulders, tryingto urge her back down. \"Rest. You were sorely injured. \"</p><p>Avelyn gritted her teeth andbrushed the maid'shands aside asshe forced herself upright. \"I wish to get up, Runilda. My head will ache whether I am lying or standing. \"</p><p>Givingan exasperated sigh, Runilda stopped trying toforce herback downand instead put a handunder her armtohelphertoherfeet.</p><p>With Runilda'said,Avelyn managedtostand. She leanedheavily on the maidand made it outof thetentbefore thefirst wave of nausea hit her. Standingvery still, she took deep breathsand assuredherself thatthe longershe was up, thebetter she would feel. Avelynwasn'tsureshe believedit, butit mattered little. Her husbandhad continued todo everythinghe had to do withinjured hands. Shewould manageto order some men about with a sore head.</p><p>As Runilda helped her intothe greathall, the firstplaceAvelyn looked was toward the floorsoverhead. She spottedthe hole she thought she'd fallen through and stared at it silently,recalling the last momentsbefore the fall. Despite what Dia-mandaand Lady Helen had said, Avelyn was sure she'd been hit. Hermind was atad confused, but... She could still feel the stunning blow; thepain hadbeen sharp andhardand had knocked her off balance. She remembered falling, and realizing there was nothingbeneath her lefthand; thenshe'd sufferedanother sharppain as herhead hit the farbroken edge of the hole.</p><p>Aye, Avelyn was sure someone had hit her. But who? One of the missing servants? Therooms had seemed empty, but... Nay, she had notyet even metthe people here. They would haveno reasonto harm her.</p><p>The ruined tunic came to mind. Avelyn recalled thescentof pork on the clothand herbrief fearsthatsomeonewas sabotaging her efforts, butshe quickly brushed the thought away. The two eventscould notbe connected. Ruining hersewing efforts was anentirely different prospectthanattacking her.</p><p>\"Avy! Whatever areyou doingup?\" Diamanda rushedtoward her with concern andAvelyn let her thoughtsgo. There was work to do.</p><p>The moon was high and full by the time Paen rode back into the bailey. He'dhad a long night. His triptothe village had provedfruitless. If anyone there wasa servant from the castle, theywere not admittingit, and not oneperson hadbeen willingto work at Rumsfeld. Had they been serfs, Paen could have ordered them tothecastle, buthe'd been informed thatthe serfs had fled Rumsfeld long before Legere had died. The inhabitants ofthevillageclaimed toall be freemen,peasants freeto do as theylikedso longas they helped tendthe castle fields. Without any idea what elseto do, Paenhad left the village and headed for Gerville. Servantswere neededto clean upandrun thecastle,andhe had to get them somewhere.</p><p>He'd made the long journeyto his parents' home, explained the situation to his father over ameal, thengot back onhishorseand headedhome, his ears ringing with his father's promise totake care of thematter. They should have servants at Rumsfeld by early afternoon ofthe next day. Now he was returning to Rumsfeld, arrivinglaterthaneverhe had returnedtoGerville during this past week.</p><p>Paen rode straighttothe broken-downstables. He beddeddown his mount, being sure to give him extra feed after the long journey,then walked wearilyto the keep.</p><p>The baileywas completely silent ashe crossedit. If it weren't for the men standing guard on thewallto watch for attack, he would have thought the castle hadbeen abandoned. Inall his years, Paen had never seen a bailey thissilent and empty of activity. It was ratherdisturbing.</p><p>Even more bothersome was thefact that thetentwas no longer set up out front as ithad beenwhen he'dleft. The realizationgave Paena moment's worry before he calmed himself with the thought that Avelyn must have woken upand hadittaken away. She was probably resting and recoveringfrom her injuries inside.</p><p>She'dbetter be, he thought, and felt his heartsqueeze as he recalled the vision of herdangling high above thehall. Paenwas sure the sight had scared agoodtenyears off his life. It made him feel sickjust to thinkof it. Even more upsetting hadbeen the stateof her facewhen he'd pulled her up. Avelyn hadobviouslyhit her head in the fall,andblood had drippedfrom a cut on her forehead, spreading down her cheek in rivulets thatresembled the long, thin talonsof avery large bird. Atfirst,he'd feared she wasdead, and had been more than relieved when he'dgottenher up through the holeandsaw her. chest rise and fall as heheld her in hisarms. Paen had then found himself reluctant to setherdown even when the tent was ready and a bed of furshad beenthrown quicklytogether.</p><p>Avelyn was eitherthemost fortunate or unfortunate of women. In the shorttime he'd known her, she'dsurvived fire, drowning and nowadeadly fall. Though she hadn't really been indanger during the fire,he supposed, still... Paen shook his head. His mother had claimed that the fates seemed atoddswith Avelyn since theirmarriage. It hadbeen her first commentwhen she'd heard about the latest calamitytobefall her new daughter-in-law. Thenshe'dexplainedabout the dogs attacking Avelyn's latest efforts at clothes for him. Paen was beginningto suspect it was something more than that, though he had nothing to base those suspicionsonother than asense that there were just toomany unusual incidents.</p><p>Some things weren't adding up. His mother loved her dogs, but she also demanded obedience and good behaviorfrom them and trained them accordingly. In all the time she'dhad them, Boudica and Juno had neverbefore attackedanything.</p><p>Yet, from his mother'sdescription, the animals hadripped the tunicto shreds. And thenthere was the firein the tent. He could stillrecall Avelyn's earnest face asshe'd assuredhim thatshe'd blownoutthe candle. Her certainty hadwanedonlywhen he'd suggested she'd been in a hurryand hadnot paid enough attention to besure the candlewas out.</p><p>This latest incident was what really madehimwonder. Hisfather had askedhow it hadhappened, and Paen simply hadn't been able to explain it. He and his father both had been in the room whenthey'd first inspected the castle. Even if she hadn't seen theholes from the floor below, Avelyn would havenoted thematonce on entering the room. She couldn't have missed seeing the hole. It wassimply impossible.</p><p>Nay, Paenfelt sure no onecouldbe this unlucky. Something was amiss,and he intendedtoquestionhis wife carefully about thislatestaccident. Hewouldalsokeep a closer eye on her. And wouldfinally start on his campaign toshowAvelynher own value. It was somethinghe'dtoo long neglected.</p><p>Thekeep's doubledoors were wide open in welcomeand Paen stepped inside.</p><p>He pausedtolook around his greathall. Every lastone of the menwas sprawledon the great-hall floor, snoring up a storm. They were sleeping the deep sleep of the exhausted,andit took littlemore than aglancearound to seewhy. They had worked hardinhisabsence. Thehallfloorwas now covered withathickcarpet of fresh rushes. He couldn'tsee the stairsinthe dimlight from the fireplace, butsuspected theywereprobablymendedandsafe again.</p><p>Paen wassurethere were otherchanges as well, butit was late and he waswilling towait until morning to inspect them. For now, he simply wantedto knowwhere his wife was. Hewouldn't be able to relaxuntil he'd seen that she really hadrecovered.</p><p>His gaze was drawn tothe tent in the center of the hall. Tired as he was, he'd scarcely noticedit at first. This, then,was where the tent had gotten to. It hadbeen movedfrom outsidetothe middle of the great hall. Hehadnodoubt it was hiswife's idea - and he fullyexpectedtofind her inside.</p><p>Had he the energy, Paen wouldhave laughed at the sightof thetent surrounded bysleeping men. Shaking his head at her ingenuity in providing herself and himwith a privatehavenin the midst oftheir people, Paen began to weave hisway through the bodies ofhis sleeping men.</p><p>it was a testament to their exhaustion that not one of the men stirred as he crossed the floor. Paen supposed thatspending the morninghaulingrock for the outerwall,then the afternoon and probably early eveningcleaning and repairing the castle,had knocked out the majority ofthem. Hemanagedto reach thetent withouttrippingoveranyone, then slippedsilently inside. In here it was pitch-black. He realized therewould be noway to check his wife'sinjuries. Heslowly moved acrossthetent toward the back rightcorner, where he imagined the furs would be laid outas they hadbeen onthe journey to Gerville. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paen immediately stumbled over something on the floor.</p><p>Put off balance, he muttered a curseand halfhoppedand half stumbled to the corner. The moment his foot hitthe furs, Paen lost the last of his balance and tumbled to the floor, grunting ashelanded. The women had beenawfully sparing with the furs, itseemed, but he supposed heshould just be grateful he had not landed on and crushed hiswife. It hadbeen a closecall,he realized when she rolled over inhersleep and curled against him as he lay there.</p><p>\"My lord?\"</p> <p>Paen froze when those words came to him from outof thedarkness.</p><p>\"Runilda?\"he asked, sure it washis wife'smaid's voiceaddressing him from the floor near where he'd tripped. \"Aye, my lord. Why are you not above stairs J with LadyAvelyn?\"</p><p>Paen froze,his eyes shootingdownward as he tried to make out the figurelying nexttohimin the dark.</p><p>\"Paen?\"Diamanda's sleepy voice drifted up to himand hefelt her hand move againsthis legsas ifshe couldn't believe he was there.</p><p>And then,astonishingly, Lady Helen was heard to mutter,\"Good heavens - what is going on?\" fromanothercorner.</p> <p>Cursing, Paen launched himself to his feet andstumbled backacross the tent, so flustered by his mistake that he didn't even think to mutter an apology before escaping out intothe safetyof thegreat hall.</p><p>Hehurried across thehall, leapingoverbodies and moving too quickly through the darkness. He nearly knocked his wife over beforehe sawher.</p><p>\"Husband?\" Avelyncaught at his arms to keep her feet ashereached to steady her.</p><p>\"Aye. What are you doing up?\"</p><p>\"Iheard you ride in. When you did not comeabove stairs, I realized you did not know where our bed is. So I came to find you. \"</p><p>\"Oh. \" He sighed as she felt forhis hand in thedark, then followed when she turned tolead himup the stairs. Paen remainedsilent as they movedthrough the pitch-black hall, depending on her to know theway. Muchto his relief, whenthey reached the room he was able to see again by the soft glowof a fire in thefireplace.</p> <p>The light revealed thebandage around her head,and Paen frowned at the sight of it. \"Howis yourhead?\"</p><p>\"It's fine,thank you,\" Avelyn murmured, then changed the subject. \"Runilda told me youhadgone to thevillage. \"</p><p>\"Aye. \"He glanced around theroom, noting that she'd not only hadthe room cleanedand new rushes put down,but had had their chests moved infrom the wagon. She'dalsohad the old bedremoved. Paenknew Legere's bed hadbeen in bad shape,but had expectedto make dountil a new onecouldbemade. However, Avelyn had made a nest of furs forthem to sleepon.</p><p>\"Ithought you were inthe tent,\"he blurted out.</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. \"Nay. We ran out of timebefore we could prepare a second room forDiamanda and LadyHelen, so Ihad the tent set up to allow them some privacyfrom themen. Runilda isin with them. \"She smiled faintly. \"I guess 'tisgood I came to find you ere you stumbled in there and woke everyone up. \"</p><p>Paengrimaced. \"I didstumble in thereand woke everyoneup. It wasnotuntil Runilda asked why I was notupherewithyou that Irealized my mistake. \"</p><p>Avelyn gave a softlaugh, then shrugged. \"They are probably alreadyasleepagain, my lord. Everyonewas exhausted afterthe day's work. \"She paused and asked, \"Were you able to convince anyvillagersto work in thecastle? Thatiswhy you wenttothe village, isit not?\"</p><p>\"Aye, that is why, butI had no luck. Noonethere was willing to work for us. The village is poor and in no better shape than the castle. Between Legere and the reavers, they have been beaten down time andagain. They are angry, and resentthat Father neglected to look out for their welfareas he should have done,\" he admitted on a sigh. \" Tiswhy I took so long. Irodeto Gerville. Father promised tovisit the village at Gerville first thing inthe morning and arrange for new servantsforhere. He will send them at once, and they should start arriving by noon. \"</p> <p>\"Oh. \" She nodded. \"Well, good. The mengot alot donetoday, butthere is still much to do. The servantswill be welcome. \" Avelyn shifted on her feet, then glanced around theroom. \"Are you hungry orthirsty?\"</p><p>\"Nay. Iate atGerville. \"</p><p>She nodded, thenturned to walk towardthebed offurs. \"It is late and you look exhausted. I should stopaskingyou questions and let youget somesleep. \"</p><p>Paenfollowedher tothe bed, asmall sigh slipping from his lips. Hewas tired, and she'd had a terrible fall today. Neither ofthem was inanyshape for him to bed her, but that didn't stop him fromwishing he could.</p><p>Tomorrow,he promised himself as hedisrobedand climbed intothenestof furs nexttoher. He would definitely make love to hiswifetomorrow.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Paen wasgone and bright sunlight was pouringinto the roomwhen Avelyn woke up. Blinking sleepily, she peeredtowardthe window. While she'dslept,someone had removed the furs Runildahad hung overthe opening the night before. Either Paen had done it beforeleaving theroom, or Runilda had already been upin the room at least once that morning.</p><p>As if drawn byher thoughts,the door opened andRunilda entered carrying a basinof water.</p><p>\"You are awake. \" The maidsmiled as shecrossedthe room. \"How do youfeel?\"</p><p>\"Better,\"Avelyn admittedafter a pause to take inventory. Much to her relief, the pain that had beenhammering at her headthrough the afternoonand evening before was now gone. The factwas enough to makeher smile as she sat up in bed. \"Much better,thank you, Runilda. Whereis my husband?\"</p><p>\"He has been working on the wall with the men since first light,\" the maid announced as she carried thewashbasin to the chest.</p><p>AsAvelyn went towashshe pondered what she woulddo that day. Thechests they hadbrought with them were the only furniture theyhad inthe keep andhad doubled as seats and tables the daybefore. Avelyn decided that was asituationthat should be rectified.</p><p>The inside of the keep was her responsibility, and she had every intention of taking care of it. She thought she might make atrip to the village thatmorning before the servants startedtoarrive fromGerville. Paen had said the village hadsuffered as badly from the reaversas Rumsfeld had,and Avelyn hoped to relieve some of the poverty andrepairsome of the hard feelings by having all theirgoods made in the village.</p><p>Furniture wasn't the only thingshewould need to purchase,shethoughtasher stomach grumbled. At the moment, theyhad nocook at Rumsfeld, and whilethey did havethe foodsthey'd brought with them, thosewouldn't last long. However, she suspectedtheywouldn't be easily replaced either. Theonly animal she'dseen so far was the pigthat haddecided tobed downinthe greathallwhen theyarrived. She feared it might be the only livestock they had.</p><p>\"Ishall go let the men know they can start work on the floorsin the other rooms now,\" Runildasaid asshe laid acleangown onthechest. \"Lord Paen ordered them not to start hammeringuntilyou were, awake,\" Runilda explained when Avelyn glanced atherwithsurprise.</p><p>\"How long have they been waiting?\" Avelynaskedwitha frown.</p><p>\"Halfthe morning,\"Runilda said with amusement, then added,\"But they kept busy whiletheywaited. Lady Helenhadthem cleaning and carting in the kitchens. \"</p><p>\"Half themorning?\" Avelyn echoed with horror. Shehadn't realized she'dslept so late. \"Whydid you not wake me?\"</p><p>\"Lord Paensaid to let you sleep as late as youneeded, that it wouldhelp you heal. \"</p><p>Avelyn let alittlesighslipfrom her lips. It had beenthoughtful of him,but there was muchshe wished to get donetoday and the morningwas half over.</p><p>\"I shalljust let the menknow theycan start work, thenI'll return tohelp you dress,\" Runildaassured her, then slipped from the room.</p><p>Avelynturned herattention toher ablutions, using therose-scented water and a smallstrip of linen to wash herself. Sheheard Runilda open the door again minutes later, but continuedtowash,lifting one footto rest on the chestas she ran the cloth overher leg. When hands closed over her shoulders, she jumped in surprise,then whirled to find herself facing Paen.</p><p>\"Oh, husband, you startled me,\" she said breathlessly, then realized she was standing therenaked before him. Sheraised her little linen between them, tryingto coverherself withthe bit of cloth. It was afutile effort,worsethan useless, really, andPaen gaveit the attention it deserved. None. Ignoring the damp cloth, he caught herbythe upper armsanddrew her forward. Hethen lowered his head and covered hermouthwithhis.</p><p>At first,Avelynstood still, too flustered to respond, but Paen soonmadeher forget her embarrassment. When his tongue slipped out to tease her lips, she automatically let them drift open and breathed a small sigh into his mouth as his tongue slid in. A familiarheat immediately began to pool inside her. Avelyn soon forgot her linenand let it drop so she could slipher hands aroundhisneck. Paen was fully clothed, andthecloth of his tunicand braes felt rough against her tender flesh, as he cupped her behind andurged her againsthim. The cloth of his tunic rubbed acrossthe sensitive tips ofherbreasts, sending a shiver alongherback.</p><p>When Paen broke the kissandhis lips trailed to herneck, Avelynlet herhead fall back,her fingers knotting in his hair. She had thought his mouth wouldcontinue downto herbreastsas it had when they'd finally consummated theirmarriage, but instead, he pulled hislipsaway. She gave a little startas he cupped onebreastand squeezed gently. Thenhe caught the nipple betweenthumb and forefinger, teasing it untilit washard and aching. Only then did hefinally drop hismouthtolave it.</p><p>\"Oh,\" Avelyn breathed as he caught her nipple between his teeth and nipped lightly. She gasped and roseup ontiptoes as thehandthat had been holdingher breast suddenly swept down betweenherlegs.</p><p>He cuppedherthere briefly, pressing firmly upward; then his fingers slid between the foldsand Avelynfound herself clutching desperately at his shoulders as his fingers danced overhermost tender flesh.</p><p>\"Husband?\" Avelyngasped uncertainly as she felt herbody begin totightenwith familiar excitement.</p><p>Raisinghis head, Paen claimed her mouthagain, hiskiss more aggressive this time, his tongue thrusting into heralmost forcefully. Asit did, she felt his finger slip inside her, and Avelyn cried out intohismouth, her hips bucking instinctively into thecaress, and doing so again as hisfinger slid out and then backinmore deeply.</p><p>She couldfeel her nails digginginto his skin, butcouldn't seemtohelp herselfas she rode the pleasurehe wasgiving her.</p><p>Had Hugo reallysaid aman's hands were not needed for thebedding? Perhaps they weren't - certainly her husband had proven that the first time they'd consummated thewedding - but,dear God, they could addsomuch pleasure. Paen droveheroff the edge with just his touch until shecried out and saggedagainsthim.</p><p>She wasnothingbut asenseless,trembling mass whenPaen scooped her up into his arms and carried herto the furs. Avelyn did not evenmindthat she was naked, fullyexposed as helaid her out onthe bed. Her eyes were drowsy and she felt almost druggedas shewatchedhim stripoffhis tunic and shed his braes. Thistime Avelyn felt no fear atthesize ofhim, butcouldenjoy the beauty of his physique as he straightened, then knelt on thefurs by her feet.</p><p>Watchingher face, Paen caught her by one ankle and liftedit to rest on his shoulder, then caughtthe other andraised it as well. Avelyn blinked, unsure what he was doing,then heslidhis hands under her hips and pulled her forward across the furs untilhis manhood pressedagainst her. Shestaredathim withconfusion. This was something elsehermother hadn't mentioned. Then he slid intoher, and Avelyn's back bowed, a surprised moan slipping from her lips as he filled her.</p><p>With Paen outof her reach, she found herselfclutching atthebed linens on either sideof her headas he withdrew andthen drove intoher again. He reached between them to caress thesensitive center of her as he thrust again. Avelyncriedout,her headtwisting on the linen-covered fursas her sensitive body immediately responded.</p><p>Her heelsdug intohis shoulders, her legs flexing asone footslid off his shoulder.</p><p>Rather thancatch it and pull it backup, Paenmoved her other ankle off andleaned over her, holding his weight off of her with hisarms as hecontinued to drive intoher untiltheyboth cried out with pleasure.</p><p>Avelyn was aslimp asa wetlinen asPaen shiftedoff ofher. He settled himself beside her,then drewher into his arms, moving her head to wherehewantediton his chest. She smiled faintly at the action, finding it adorable, for some reason.</p><p>Avelyn was suddenly too tired to botherto try tosort it out. She simply let her eyes driftclosed and allowedherhusband'sheartbeattolull her into sleep.</p><p>It was nearly noon the next time Avelyn woke up, andher husband had again alreadyleft the bed. She didn't mind, though; itallowed herprivacy to washand dress. Avelyn couldn't even seemto mind thatonce againshe'd sleptthe morning away. She smiledas she descended the stairs... untilshe spotted the activityby the fireplacein the great hall.</p><p>Avelynpausedon the stairs, gripped the newrail the menhad put on the night before and stared in disbelief. The sow had returned. Runildaand Diamandawere trying to get the beast on her feet and out of the keep, but the sow appearedto have a stubborn streak. Shewas ignoring alltheir efforts to rouse her.</p><p>Shakingher head, Avelyn hurried down the stairs and crossedthe hallto join Lady Helen, whowas standing to theside,wringingherhands as Diamanda poked at the pig,trying to get ittoits feet: \"Oh, do be careful, Diamanda,\"her auntsaid with concern. \"Canyou not fetch oneof thementoscareit out ofhere?\"</p><p>\"Paen usedan apple to lure it out yesterday,\"Avelyn saidas she paused beside Lady Helen.</p><p>\"Oh, Avelyn, dear. How are you feeling? Has the rest helped your head? I know you were in terrible painyesterday. \" Lady Helen forgother worry for a momentto offer Avelyn a smile.</p><p>\"Iam much better, thank you,\"Avelyn murmured.</p><p>\"I did try an apple, but she doesn't appear to be interested,\" Diamanda announced. Pullingan apple from her skirt, she held it before the pig, but the trick wasn'tworking thistime. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Oh, well, perhaps...\"Avelyn paused. She had startedto walk around the animal, but had onlytaken a couple of steps before she sawwhat the trouble was. \"Oh, dear. \"</p><p>\"What is it?\" Diamandaasked, moving curiously toward her.</p><p>\"Iam afraid weare notmovingherfor awhile. \"</p> <p>\"What? Why?\" the petite blondeasked, then reached Avelyn's side, peered at the animalandbreathed, \"Oh. \"</p><p>\"What? What isit?\" Lady Helen did not come closer, and Avelyn wasstartingto realize the woman was afraid of the sow.</p><p>\"She is birthing!\" Runilda said with delighted surprise as she moved to join Diamanda and Avelyn.</p><p>\"Oh, no!\" Lady Helen cried with horror. \"She must notdo that inside,not here.</p><p>DearGod. \"</p> <p>\"My lady!\"</p><p>Avelyn turned toward the door as Paen's squire rushed into the hall, nearly stumbling over his feet in his hurry. Managing to reachherside withoutfalling, David gasped, \"Lord Paensent me totellyou that Lord Gervilleand hiswife are riding through the gates. \"</p><p>Avelyn's eyebrows rose at this news. Paen had said last night that his father was sending servants, but had madeno mention ofhisparents returning with them. She supposed sheshould have expected as much.</p><p>Avelyn went outside to greet them,andmoments later, Paen's mother was making a fuss over her headwound and telling hernot to worry; she intended to stay for a couple of days andwould tend to everything untilAvelynfelt better. The words brought aresigned sigh from Lord Gerville beforehe left to findhis son.</p><p>\"Now, youshould go lie down and rest. \"Lady Gerville ushered Avelyn up the steps intothe keep. \"I will set the servants tounloading things andsetting - Oh!\"</p><p>She stopped abrupdy and staredaround thegreat hall. \"You have madea good start of it despite yourinjury. \" Her gaze slidacross the freshrushes spread over the clean floor, then to the newly repaired stairs. \"Why, it looks ever somuch better already. \"</p> <p>\"Paenordered his men to fix thestairs andthe flooraboveafterAvelyn'sfall,\"</p><p>Diamanda informed her.</p><p>\"Aye,\" LadyHelen agreed. \"And he orderedthe men to clean while heheaded out in search of servants. We directed them untilAvelyn felt well enough to move about. \"</p><p>\"I see. \"LadyGerville's gaze slid again to Avelyn's forehead witha frown. \"You should go rest,dear. Head wounds are such trickythings, and - \" She stopped again as her gaze slid around the hallandlanded on the sow in the back corner. \"Oh, dear, I seeshe is back. \"</p><p>\"I am afraid so. She seemsto see the open doors as an invitation to enter. \"</p><p>Avelyn followed asPaen's mother moved toward the animal. \"The doors are inneed of repairand will not close. I had meant toorder a couple of men to repair them today, but I was notquick enough. Unfortunately,she is inlabor, so I fear we shall not gethermovedfor abit,\" she added as Lady Gervillestarted towardthe backend of thesow.</p><p>\"Oh,my, sosheis,\"Lady Gerville agreed, thenheaved a sigh. \"Well, we shall have to let her befor now, Isuppose. \" She turned her attention backtoward Avelyn.</p><p>\"Now,why do younot go rest? We have several servants with us,and more are ridingwith the carts andshouldbearriving soon. I am afraid I wastoo impatientto ride as slow as the wagonstravel. \"</p> <p>Avelyn resisted the lady's urgings toward the stairs. Really,she hadalreadyslept most of the day away and hadthings she wantedto get done. \"I have just awoken,\"</p><p>sheadmitted as Lady Gerville began tofrown at her resistance. \"And itissuch a lovely, rare sunnyday, Ithought Imight just takea smallstroll... to clear my head. \"</p><p>\"Oh. \" Lady Gerville smiled. \"That may be just thething foryou,dear. Why do you not take Diamandawith you in case you have any problems? AsI say,head woundscan be tricky. \"</p><p>Avelyn hesitated, reluctant to agree to thegirl'spresence. She liked Diamanda well enough,but had been hoping to sneakdown to the village and - \"That would benice. I'd be happy to come with you,\" Diamandasaid brightly, obviouslyeager toavoidall thecleaning that was about tohappen. Thegreat-hall walls stillneeded whitewashing, therewerestill the two smaller roomsabove stairsto be tendedto,and the kitchens as well, not to mention the herb garden. Avelyn couldn't blame the girl forherrelief in avoiding thosechores.</p><p>Supposing there wasno help for it, Avelynnoddedand agreed, \"Thatwould be nice. \"</p><p>\"Off you go, then,and take Runilda with youto keepyou out of trouble. Lady Helen and Ishallsee to thingshere; you have a nice walk,\" Lady Gervilleshooed them out of the keep.</p><p>Runilda and Diamanda fell into step on either side of her as Avelyn headed across the bailey.</p><p>\"Wherearewe walking to?\" the petite blonde asked when she ledthem past the menstanding guard atthe gates.</p><p>Avelyn bit her lip and tried to decide what to tell her.</p><p>\"Avy?\" Diamanda asked, her steps slowing asAvelyn ledthem toward the path through the woods.</p><p>Sighing, she paused and glanced back the way they'd come, relieved to notethat theywereout of earshot of the guards. \"Ithought to go to thevillage. \"</p><p>\"What?\" Diamanda looked horrified. \"But, wecannot - \"</p><p>\"It is not that far,\" Avelyn soothed. \"We passedit on the ride here yesterday,and it is notfar at all. \"</p><p>\"But Paen said this morningwhile we were breaking fast that the villagers are angry about Lord Gerville's neglecting them and resent our presence here. We should not - \"</p><p>\"Ihope to make a startat repairing the rift,\" Avelyn admitted.</p><p>Diamandahesitated. \"How?\"</p><p>\"Well, we have not gota lickof furniturein the keep, Diamanda. \"</p><p>\"Aye, Idid notice,\"the girl said dryly. \"There is no place to sit or eator - \"</p><p>\"Just so. \" Avelyn nodded. \"Ithought perhaps we could tend tothat and mend some ill feelings at thesame time if wehired villagers to build them. \"</p><p>When the blonde looked uncertain, Avelyn added, \"I thought we might also purchasesome foodstuffs, baked goods if there isa baker, and ale from the alewife.</p><p>We cannot produce anyof thesethings yetourselves. \"</p><p>\"Ale and bread?\" Diamanda said, moving her hand to her stomach. \"Tis noon. \"</p><p>\"Aye, and you have not yet broken your fast, my lady,\" Runilda pointed out.</p><p>\"Justso. \" Avelyn smiled atthem. \"Ibrought coinswith me. We can sample the foods and buy some for the keep, as well aspossibly see about furniture and other things. If the village is as pooras Paen claims, they may be happy forthe trade. \"</p><p>\"Or they may not haveanything to trade,\" Diamanda argued.</p><p>\"We can but find outone way or the other,\"Avelyn said with a sigh, then raised hereyebrows. \"Are you willing to come with me?\"</p><p>Diamandaglanced back toward the keep, then nodded slowly. \"Aye. I fear it will be afailure, butwe may as well go see. \"</p><p>Nodding,Avelyn struckout on thepath again. It was a warm, sunny day, and she would have enjoyed thewalk if shewerenot soworried about thecomingvisitto the village. Paen had saidthe villagers resented them,soshe could not hopefora warm welcome,but she was hoping her coins would help.</p><p>\"Mayhap weshould have ridden on horseback. \"</p><p>Diamanda'svoice drew Avelynfrom her thoughts, and she glanced around. While the village hadseemed only moments away onhorseback, it wasabit furtheron foot. Still, not a great distance, but Avelyn got the idea that Diamanda had led something ofa pampered existenceat Gerville, withservants constantly at her beck andcall.</p><p>\"It cannotbe much further,Diamanda. I am sure 'tisjust aroundthis bend. \"</p><p>Diamanda grunted with disbelief, then breathed a small \"oh\"of surprise asthey cameout of the bend and foundthemselves walking intothe village.</p><p>It was smalland not very prosperous, but Avelyn had expected as much. She simplyhadn'texpected such miserableconditions. Thevillage and its peoplehad truly suffered under Legere's leadership. She suspected herproject was goingto be more difficult than she'd expected.</p><p>\"Theydo not lookvery welcoming. \" Diamanda moved astep closerto Avelyn as they neareda groupof women gossiping outside a rowof tiny, dilapidated hutson theedge of the village. The women turnedto gawkatthem,their expressions cold andsuspicious. \"Weare notgoing to talk to them, are we?\"</p><p>Hearing the fearin the younger girl's-voice, Avelyn gave in to herown cowardice and shook her head. \"Nay. We shall go to thevillage center. Perhaps we can find someonethere who appears morehelpful. \"</p><p>Diamandamade a sound that couldhave been agreementor not, then asked,\"Are you sure thisis a good idea?\"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Avelyn answered firmly,but she wasbeginning to wonder. It had seemed a fine ideawhen she'd come up with it, but as theypassed one villager afteranother and were met with silent resentment each time, she beganto doubt her plan would work. Bythetime they reached the village center, she was even beginning to doubt their chances of escaping thevillage without beingattacked,at leastverbally.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\"We have a following,\" Diamanda murmured, glancing nervously over her shoulder.</p><p>Avelyn did notlook back. She'd been aware ofthe growingcrowd following them as they walked. It was part of the reason her confidence in the endeavor was becoming shaken.</p><p>Afraid to stop walking lest it spur their followers on to actuallydoing orsaying something, Avelyn glanced around a bit anxiously. Whereas they had passednothing but smallcruck housesonthe outskirts of the village,here inthecenter wereseveral larger wattle-and-daub buildings that servedas bothhome andbusiness. The biggest bore asign so faded theonly word legible was Inn.</p><p>Relief pouring through her, Avelyn turned her steps towardit and tried to maintain an unhurried pace.</p><p>The women released arelieved breath as they steppedinside the dim buildingand thedoor closed behindthem. That relieflasted as longas it tookfor theireyesto adjustto the lowlight. They stood in a mid-sized room lit only by a couple of torches. There were twolarge trestle tables,one oneither sideof theroom. There was also a door directly across from them, presumably leading to the kitchens.</p><p>Thereweresix men inthe room, five customers spread out over thetwo tables and a man Avelyn assumed was the innkeeper. He stood in frontof the dooracross from them,arms crossed andstance belligerent. Every last one of themen waseyeing them with suspicion and intense dislike.</p><p>Avelyn sighed. it was obvious thateveryone knew they werefrom the castle. She supposed the fact that they were on foot would be telling, not to mention their clothing... orat least, Diamanda'sexpensive gown. Her own dressfit inrathernicely withthe villagers'garb, she noted witha grimace. Though the cloth was a fine expensive weave,it was dark and drab and ill-fitting, as weremostof thegarments the villagerswore.</p><p>Straighteningher shoulders, Avelyn ignored the silent glancesaroundthemand led Diamanda andRunildato anempty space at thetable on theright. While the other twosat, Avelyndid not. Shesuspectedtheywereunlikely to get serviceifthey waited, so she didn't bother. Instead, she asked Diamanda and Runilda if they wished food and drink. Despite complaining of hunger on their walk there, Diamanda shook her head. Apparently,she had lost her appetite. EvenRunilda said nay.</p><p>Avelyn noddedandwalked to theinnkeeper, pasting apleasant smileonherface.</p><p>She saw aflickerof surprise in his eyesas she approached, butthat was all. He did notevenask whatshe wanted. Aye,thesepeoplereally resented theirpresence, she thought on an inward sigh, then simply widened her smile. \"Iwill havethree...\"</p><p>she paused to glance around attheothercustomers andnoticed mostof themwere eating some sort ofmeat pasty. Knowing itmust be the bestfood they served, she pointed to thenearest man and finished, \"three of whathe is having,as well as three meads and an ale, please. \"</p><p>Avelyn beamed another smileat him as if completely obliviousto the animosity in the air, then turned and walkedback to joinDiamandaand Runilda, afraid that if she gave him the chance,the man would refusetoservethem. She held herbreathas she waited for the man's reaction. Hewas still hesitating where she'dleft himas Avelyn squeezed herself in the smallspace between Diamanda and Runilda, but after a moment, hehuffed with irritation and turned to walk into the kitchen.</p><p>Avelyn letherbreath outslowly, grateful atleast that hehadn't thrown themout.</p><p>The threewomen were silentas they waitedfor theirrepast. It didn'ttake long.</p><p>Within moments,the innkeeper was back, slamming the drinksdown beforethem.</p><p>\"Why did you order four drinks?\" Diamanda asked as the man movedback into the kitchen.</p><p>\"I wish to tryboth the mead and the ale,\" Avelyn answered, but didn't explain further. Instead, she tried the mead, sippingitcautiously, then relaxing when it did notturn out tobe soured or otherwiseunpalatable. She'd almost feared the man might do somethingtotheir food or drinks to discouragetheir enjoyingit. Of course, thefood hadn't comeyet, shereminded herself asshe set the meaddownand tried the ale.</p><p>Avelyn pausedas theliquid filledher mouth. Although the mead was average, the ale was fine. Quite fine.</p><p>\"Who makes your ale?\" Avelyn asked when the innkeeper returned with their pasties.</p><p>\"Ida What ofit?\"</p><p>Avelyn peered around the innkeeper to see awomanstandingin the kitchen door, staring at themcoldly. Hiswife, she suspected. The womanhad probablycometo peekthrough the door atthem, then stepped out on hearing Avelyn's question.</p><p>\"Mycompliments,\" Avelynsaidsolemnly. \"It isvery fine ale, someof the best I have ever tasted. \"</p><p>The woman's expression became stiffer as if suspecting Avelyn was up to something until she added, \"The mead is good enough, butnot as fine as the ale. \"</p><p>Suchhonesty seemedtoconvincethewomanthat Avelyn wasn'tbuttering herup forsomething, andsherelaxedenough that she was at least no longer scowling as she noddedandsaid,\"The mead today is notmybesteffort. It isusuallybetter. \" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Avelyn nodded, believing her. \"May I ask your name?\"</p><p>She hesitated, then saidin a short, clipped tone, \"Avis. \"</p><p>\"Thank you, Avis. I am Avelyn. \" She smiled faintly, then asked,\"Can youmake both the mead and the ale in quantity?'' The woman blinked, then said warily, \"I could. \"</p> <p>\"Then I wouldaskthat you doso and sendasmuch as you can make to the castle. \"</p><p>Avishesitated, probably debating whether shecould afford to tell her to goto the devil. But her eyes widened asAvelyn statedhow much she was willing to pay per keg for each beverage.</p><p>There was silence as Avelyn waited for some response, butsheseemed to have shockedthe woman to the pointof being unable to speak. Avelyn supposed that, as poor asthevillagewas,no one was able to pay much for goods. What she offered must havesounded exorbitant, butit wasa fair price, and she told her solest the innkeeper's wifethink she was tryingto buy her way out of their resentment. The price Avelyn offered was no more than hermother paidon the rare occasionswhen she purchased such things. Straughton had its own alewife, so rarely needed to purchaseextra unlessan event such as aweddingcroppedup.</p><p>\"Willyou do that?\" Avelyn asked finallywhenthe silence had drawn out so long it was becominguncomfortable.</p><p>\"O'course shewill,\" the innkeepersaid, even as his wife finally nodded. Theman was almostsmiling now, she noted.</p> <p>\"Thank you,\"Avelynmurmured, but noticedthe womanwas hesitating by the door, shifting on her feet as if she wanted to get right to work buthad a questionto ask.</p><p>\"Willyou want it regular?\" Avis finally asked. \"Or are youhaving acelebration or - \"</p><p>\"Wewill need itregularly,\" Avelyn assuredher. \"Wehave no alewife asyet. \"</p><p>Eyes wide and slightly dazed, Avis nodded several times,then turned and hurried back into the kitchen. Theinnkeeper hurried afterher,and Avelyn picked upher pastieandtook atentative bite.</p><p>\"Thisis quitegood too,\" shemurmured encouragingly toDiamandaand Runilda after chewingandswallowing the firstbite.</p><p>Both women reluctantly began to eat, obviouslyuncomfortable underthe stares of the men around them. While the attitude of the innkeeper and his wife may have thawed toward them, theothermen were still eyeing themwith opendislike. It made the meal uncomfortable,but Avelyn would not allow them to scare her. Still, she was grateful when they hadfinishedand could leavewithout looking asifthey hadbeen frightened off.</p> <p>They steppedout of the innto findthat the crowd outside had grown in size.</p><p>Avelynsensed Diamanda andRunilda movingcloser toher,butmerely led them toward what lookedto be a baker's premises. She didn't experience anyrelief at all on entering the shop, since the crowd followed theminside. As many ofthem who could packedthemselves into the small front room of the baker's, while the rest crowded aroundthe open door.</p><p>On first entering, therewas nosignof the baker, and Avelyn wasjust wondering whatto do when there was a disturbance by the door and she heard someone snarling, \"Get outof thebloody way, you fools,'tismyshop. \"</p><p>She watched theround little man enter, noted the anger onhis faceand knew she was infor atimeof it. Shewasn't surprisedwhen hefinally struggledinto the room, tuggedhis clothinginto place,glared at her andsnarled,\"I'm not Avis, sodon't be thinking youcan buyyerway intome good graceslike I hear ye did her. Now be off withye!\"</p><p>Avelynstood very still asa murmurofapproval wentthrough the crowd,then nodded calmly. \"Very well,sir. \"</p><p>DiamandaandRunilda started to move towardthedoor, only to pause whenthey realized Avelyn wasn't moving. Theyturned reluctantly back as sheadded to the baker, \"However,I feel I shouldtell you I couldn't care lessabout your good graces.</p><p>All I bought from Avis is aleand mead, enough for two hundred soldiers and servants, and allI wanted from you isenough baked goods to feed as manypeople. \"</p><p>She-wasmost satisfiedbythe realization that dawned on theman'sface.</p> <p>\"Two hundred people?\" heaskedfaintly.</p><p>\"Aye. Irealize 'tis a large quantity, butI thoughtmayhap youcould get the women inthe village who are the best cooks tomake some in theirhomes. It would have helped you and allowed them toearn some coin too,\" Avelyn pointed out,knowing the baker couldnot possibly handle such a large orderonhis own.</p><p>\"I must confess, I do not understand your attitude, sir,\" Avelyn continued.</p><p>\"Especially since Iam neither Legere,nor Lord Wimarc, but thenew lady of the castle whois inneed of goodsand would rather purchase themfrom the people. of her village - whoarein needof the trade - than sendthecoins out toanother town or village. However, as you are fool enough to turn down good coin for your pride...\"</p><p>Shrugging, she moved tojoin Runildaand Diamanda by the door asif preparing toleave. Shehadn't taken two steps when the man spoke. \"Wait. \"</p><p>Avelyn nearly saggedwithrelief, but, aware ofall the eyes watching her, she tried to hide her feelings and simply turned backto the man tonegotiate terms with him.</p><p>Inmoments, the baker was smiling, his pockets jingling when next sheturnedaway.</p><p>Avelynled Runilda and Diamandato the door,noting theway thecrowdwent silent and parted asshe approached. She paused in thedoorway and peered over the sea of faces. Shecould notsee theother tradesmen's shopswith all the people there and so had no idea where to gonext. Aftera hesitation, she asked,\"Are there any carpenters here?\"</p><p>Severalhands went up. One man didn't bother to raise his hand, but made his way tothe frontof thecrowd. \"I ama master carpenter. \"</p><p>\"Did you make the trestle tables inthe inn?\" Avelynasked aftera reflective pause.</p><p>They had been good,sturdytables, yetlookedeasily collapsible andhad shownfine attentiontodetailin the carvingof thelegs.</p><p>\"Aye. \" He appearedsurprised.</p><p>Avelyn nodded. \"You willneedhelpfor what I want. \"</p><p>\"Ihave it ifI need it,\" hesaid calmly, not looking as if hebelieved her.</p><p>Avelyn shrugged inwardly,thenannounced, \"I need new trestle tables. Enough for two hundred men and servants to sit at. Benches of course, and four chairsfor the high table. Four more chairs for thefireside and - nay, make that six chairsfor the fireside,\" shecorrected herself. As Lord and LadyGerville would probably visit often and she had noidea how long Diamanda and Lady Helen would stay, six seemed smarter. \"I shall also need three large beds. \" Avelyn hesitated again, wondering about how much she should spend justnow. Could sheafford to get chairs foreach bedchamber as well? It would be nice tohavea chairto siton while she dried her hair by the fire. Two chairsin their room would allowher and Paento sit by the fire of acold winternight.</p><p>Avelyn decided to get thechairs. Shehad her owncoins. Herparentshad always spoiled her and hadincluded coins among the chestsof goods they'd sent with her.</p><p>\"Six morechairs forthe bedchambersandseveralsmall tables. \"</p><p>When she finished, there were several moments of complete silence; then the carpenter cleared his throat and admitted painfully, \"Even with the help of every capable man here I cannotprovide this much furniture as fast asa larger - \"</p><p>\"I realize that, sir,\"Avelyn assured him,impressed with his honesty. Another carpenter would have beencalculatingthe coinsthis would bring him and unwisely assuring her he'd have it for her ina trice. Speakingclearly sothata good deal of the crowd could hear,Avelyn said, \"WhileI would like the furnitureas quicklyas you can manage, I am willing to wait. Iwouldprefer to keeptheprofit from this venture herein ourvillage. \"</p><p>He nodded slowly. \"Whatwould youlike first, my lady?\"</p><p>\"The tables, then the beds, then the chairs, then the smaller tables,\" Avelyn answered, then glanced around at the crowd, becomingaware that the feeling in the air had changed. Shehadnot won them allover, butthe crowdwas swaying.</p><p>Raising her head,she calledout, \"Is there a grocer here whocansupplymewith herbs?\"</p><p>\"Oh, Avy!You were wonderful!\" Diamanda enthused as they left the villagein late afternoon.</p><p>\"I was, wasInot?\" Avelyn grinned, buoyedup byher success. It had certainly not startedout well,andfor awhile she had fearedshe'dmade ahuge mistake,but it hadworked out wellin the end. She was very satisfied.</p><p>\"Iwas ever so impressed,\" Diamanda admitted. \"Ido notknow where you found the courage to standuptothe baker when he was someantous, butyou yelled right back and even calledhim a fool. \" Her eyes were huge and round. \"I never would have had the courage to talk to him so. \"</p><p>Avelyn blinked. \"Yelling?\"</p><p>\"Aye. \" Diamandathrew anarm around her shoulders and hugged her exuberantly.</p><p>\"Nay,\" Avelyn shook her head. She hadn't thought she'dyelled, and glanced at hermaid to ask. \"SurelyI didnot yell?\"</p><p>\"Like a fishwife,\" Runilda assured her proudly.</p><p>Avelyn staredat her inhorror, and bothwomen burst out laughing.</p><p>\"You were brilliant!\" Diamanda assuredher. \"Iwanttobe just like youwhen I am married. \"</p><p>Avelyn felther lips twist wryly. After alifetime of feeling inadequate and wishing she weresomeone else,it was rather strange to hear that anyone would wish to be like her. Still,she hadimpressed even herself today. Perhapsshe wouldn't proveto be acalamitousfailure as awifeafter all,she thought hopefully.</p><p>Buoyed upby hersuccess andencouraged by Diamanda'sobviousadmiration, Avelyn felt good as theywalked back tothe casde. It wasn'tuntil she entered the great hall that she began to deflate.</p><p>\"There youare, girls!\" Lady Gerville walked upto greet them, abright smile of pleasureon herface as she wavedtoward thechanges in thegreat hall. \"What do you think? It is much nicer now,is it not?\"</p><p>\"You...\" Avelynstared at the trestletables and benches now filling the center of the hall. Her gazethenslid to the small collection of chairsbythe fire, and she shook herheadhelplessly as her happiness began to flowout of her likewater outof apail.</p><p>\"You broughtfurniture. \"</p><p>\"Aye. It wason the wagons with the servants. I did not mention itbecause I hopedtosurpriseyou. \" Her smile fadedsomewhatat Avelyn's expression. \"Are you not pleased? I thought youwouldbemorecomfortablewith...well,there was not a stickof furniturehere. \"</p><p>\"Oh, yes,\" Avelyn said quickly as she realizedhow rude shewas being. \"This is lovely. Much more comfortable. \"</p><p>\"But wejustcame backfrom thevillage wherewearranged forfurniture and all sorts of things,\" Diamandablurted out.</p><p>\"The village, yousay?\"</p><p>Avelyn turnedto peer overher shoulder atWimarc Gervilleand Paen as they entered. Both men were frowning.</p><p>\"You went to the village?\"Paen growled. \"Youcould have run into trouble. I told you they were not pleased with us there. \"</p><p>\"My lady handled itbeautifully. Hermotherwould havebeen proud,\" Runilda said firmly.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Diamandaadded. \"When the bakerwas rude to us, shewas rude right back and evenyelledat him likea fishwife. \"</p><p>Avelyn closed her eyes with an inner groanas Diamanda and Runilda regaled them with their adventures in thevillage. The silence thatfollowed was long, and she finally sighed and opened her eyestofind everyonestaring at her. \"Of course I shall cancelthe furnishings and - \"</p><p>\"You will not,\" Wimarc Gerville said sharply. \"Youhave done more today to repair our relationswiththe villagersthanany amount ofmytalking could have done.</p><p>We will keep the furnishingshere until thenew carpenter hasreplacements done, thentake themback to Gerville. The castle is mighty bare without them anyway. \"</p><p>\"And the breadsand so on that you ordered from the baker, as wellas the herbs from the grocer, shallbewelcome,\" Lady Gervillesaidfirmly. \"The. baker'sgoods shall lessen theburdenon the cook while she settlesin andarranges things, and certainly theherb garden is not up to scratch. \"Shesmiledbrilliantly. \"You have done well, my dear. \"</p><p>Avelyn could feel herspirits lift. She haddone well, after all. Her gaze slidshyly toherhusband, and she thoughtshe sawadmiration and pride onhis face. Surely he would compliment her too? After all the calamities and accidents she'd caused, surely he would be impressed and offerher a kind word for this? Instead he offered her anapple. He had beencarrying it when he entered the keepwith his father,and now he peered down at it, hesitated, then held it out.</p><p>Avelyn acceptedtheapple with confusion,then gave a startled gaspas he patted herrump.</p><p>\"Good,\" he said firmly, patted her rump again and walked off with his father toward thetrestle tables.</p><p>Avelyn stared after him withamazement; as didthe other women. They were all staringafterhim as if he'd sprouted horns. Afteramoment, Lady Gervilleturned back to Avelyn and said, \"Er... dear, why do you not go introduce yourselfto your new cook and see if shedoes not have refreshments yougirls mightenjoy after your walk. I needs mustspeaktomyson. \"</p><p>Avelynwatched her walkto thetrestletables,then headedtowardthe kitchens with Diamanda and Runilda on her heels. They had crossed half the hall before the rustling ofrushes drewher gazeto the corner andshe recalled the sow. The mother pig was still there, andPaen's squire,David,wasstanding nearby looking onwith wideeyes.</p><p>Curious as to what had caught his fascination,Avelyn changed direction, heading for the boy. Runilda and Diamanda followed.</p><p>\"Oh, look,\" Diamandacooedas they reachedthe boy to find that it wasthesow's litter that had his attention. The pig wasa newmother several times over.</p><p>\"She hashadherbabies,\" David announced unnecessarily.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Diamandagrinned. \"Are they not adorable?\"</p><p>Avelyn smiled faintlyat thegirl's words. The baby pigletswere climbingshakily all over each other ina battle toget to thesow's teats. They were indeed adorable with their huge eyes and floppy ears. She watchedtheirantics for a bit, troubled whenshe noted one tiny pig struggling to get a turnat suckling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"He mustbe the runtof thelitter,'' Diamanda commented.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Avelyn murmured. The poor little creature was a fighter, but he was weaker than the others and, no matter howmany times he tried,hecould notforce his way in to get to hismother's milk. Avelyn frowned. \"He is a fighter. \"</p><p>\"Aye,\" Diamanda said sadly,as ifknowing thatthe poorpiglet's courage would makelittle difference if he could not get to the milk.</p> <p>Avelyn wasworried too. \"Doyou thinkLadyGerville brought anything we might feed him?\"</p><p>Diamandaperkedupat the suggestion. \"We couldgosee. \"</p><p>Nodding,Avelyn knelt to scoop up thepiglet. Cuddling him against herchest, she smiled as the warm littlebody squirmed against her. She caressed him soothingly and cooed, \"It's all right, littleone. I know you are hungry. We shallfind you something to eat. \" She scratched his ear gently, then said, \"I think weshall call you Samson because weintend for you to grow up big and strong. \"</p><p>\"Just donot cut offhis hair,\" Diamanda teased, reaching up topet the piglet,then suddenly grimacing assheglancedoverAvelyn's shoulder. \"Oh-oh. Aunt Helen is coming. Shewill makea fuss if she knows wearehandlingand plan to feed one of the piglets. \"</p><p>\"Thenwe had best take him to thekitchens. \"</p> <p>Avelyn said andstarted that way, beingcareful to keep the piglet hidden byher body as she moved. Runilda, Daimanda andnow David werefollowing her. They werealmost to the door when Avelyn asked, \"Why does Lady Helen dislikepigs so much?\"</p><p>\"She does notdislike them, she is terrified ofthem,\"Diamanda explained. \"She was bittenbyonewhenshe wasa littlegirlandhas beenterrified of them eversince.</p><p>She will lecture you if she catchesyou taking him to the kitchen. \"</p><p>Avelyn felt a moment'sworry over this, thensuddenly realized thatRumsfeld was her home. She wasmistress here, and no onehad a right to lecture her for doing as she pleased... exceptperhapsfor Paen... and Lord and Lady Gerville, sheamended with a grimace. Still, while she would neverberude,if Lady Helen made too much ofafuss about what she chose to do, Avelyn decided she would just have to politely make her ownposition clear.</p><p>\"What wasthat?\"</p><p>Paen glanced upfrom theale he was enjoyingwith his father and blinked at his mother as shefaced him acrossthe trestletable. She had her hands on her hips and a very annoyed expression on her face. \"Whatwas what?\"</p> <p>\"The apple, thepatonthe rump,andthe 'good,'\"Lady Gerville saidimpatiently.</p><p>Paen blinked. \"I was praising my wife. \"</p><p>\"Thatwas praise?\" sheaskedwithdisbelief.</p><p>He shrugged. \"It is how I praise Midnight. \"</p><p>\"Midnightis a horse!\" she snapped irritably as his father burst out laughing, spitting outale.</p><p>Paen shifted uncomfortably. He'd thought he might need otherways to increase his wife'sself-esteem, buttruly it was a tricky business and he hadn'tcome upwith anything asyet. He'dneverhad a wife before, and when he needed to praise his horse or hissquire,it was with a \"good\" or \"well done\" for theboy, and an apple anda pat on therumpfor the horse. He explained this now and watched his mother's irritation abate.</p><p>\"So you haverealizedthose cousins of hers have damaged Avelyn's view of herself,\" his mother said with relief.</p><p>\"Aye, butIdo notknow how to repair it other than to praise her when she does well,\" Paensaid.</p> <p>\"Well. \" LadyGerville relaxedherstance. \"You could start by talking to the girl. \"</p><p>Paen rolled his eyes with exasperation. \"Talk. Women always seem to think talking will fix things. A sharp sword oftensolves the problemmuchmore quickly andefficiently. \"</p><p>\"Well, youcanhardly cut thepoor image outof Avelyn. And as your wifeis a woman like myself, mayhap you should try my suggestion,\" Lady Gerville said dryly. \"It is sharp, unkind wordsspokento her over the years that have caused this poor self-image in Avelyn, soI suggestthatkind and complimentarywordsmay also - withtime - undo them. Youmightliketo spend some time with her as well. Go for walks with her and play chess of a night, things like that,\" she suggested. \"Now I shalljust go have a wordwith cook about the goodsbeingbrought up from the village. It will make thingsmuch easier while everything is still in such an uproar. It was very cleverof Avelyn to go to the villageas she did. \"</p><p>Paen watched his motherwalkaway, thengave adisgruntled sigh. \"With time. I do not wantitto take years and years to undothe damage those cousinsofhers caused. I want her to know nowthatshe is smart and pretty and capable. \"</p><p>\"Hmm. \"His father nodded his understanding, then brightened. \"Well,Ishall help.</p><p>If thetwo of uscomplimenther, it may speedit up. \"</p><p>LordGerville suddenlystood. \"In fact, I will gocompliment herrightnow,and again tell her how wellshe did with her efforts thisafternoonin the village. \"</p><p>Paen watched thoughtfully as his father headed for the kitchens in search of Avelyn. The man's words had put a thought in his head. If the two of them complimentingher helped hersee that her cousins were wrong and she hadvalue, thenmany peoplecomplimenting her mightspeed it up even more...andif the whole garrison of soldiers and servants here did... Paen stood abruptly. He had to speak to his men.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\"CanI hold Samson? I promise I will notdrop him. \"</p><p>Avelyn glanced downat David andsmiledat his earnest expression. She was becoming quite attached to the boy after several days of having him trail after her.</p><p>It was a week since Avelyn's first foray into the village, and now they were returning from a secondtrip. She'd acquired Davidas her constant companion the day afterthat firstjourney. The lad had nearly gotten himself crushed by a boulder withhis clumsinesswhiletrailing Paen around the wall wherethemen were working.</p><p>Herhusbandhadaskedherthatevening ifshe would keep theboy with her untilhe'd finished the wallandmovedontoa less dangeroustask. Avelyn hadagreed at once, happy to be of servicetoherhusband inanysmallway. Theladhad been following hereversince.</p><p>Pondering the last week, Avelyndecidedthat - allin all - it had beena good one.</p><p>Paen's mother and father had ended uponly stayinga couple ofdays. Lady Gerville hadacknowledgedthatAvelyn wasn't injuredso badly that she couldn'trun her own castle... andrun it well. The last part hadnearly broughttears toAvelyn's eyes as sherecognizedit for the complimentit was. Lady Gerville had confidence inher abilities, even if Avelynherself didn't. Butthat waschanging with eachsuccess she had. Avelyn could feelherself becomingmore confident with every passingday.</p><p>The last weekhadseen the repairstothe castle speedalong. The entirecastlehad been cleaned,thekeep doors repaired and the sow andher litter moved. All except for the piglet Samson. Determined to save thefeistyrunt of the litter,Avelynhad kept him inside when the other pigs were shown thedoor,and she'd done all she could to improve his chancesof survival. Ineffect, Samson hadtaken up permanent residence in the castle,or moreprecisely, he'dtaken up permanent residencewith Avelyn,for if she was not carryinghim around, he was trailing after herunder his own steam,his little pink behind wiggling happily as he followed her from placeto place. The piglet seemedto think Avelynwashismother,muchto Paen's mingled amusementandexasperation.</p><p>This week hadalso been theweek whenher husband had seemed tosuddenly notice herpresence. Notthat he'dbeen completely oblivious before, butthis week Paen had takenthe trouble to spend time withher - playing chess of an evening, going out with her for walks. Hestill did notsay much. Avelyn wascomingto realize thatherhusbandwas a man of few words. He tended togruntmorethan speak, but on a fewoccasions he'd had whole conversations with her. She always found these discussions interestingwindows into his thoughts. Avelynwashappy to learnthat herhusbandwas a good,fair and honest man.</p><p>\"Please?\" David begged,remindingAvelyn of his request to hold Samson. She hesitated, then gave inandhanded Samsontothe boy.</p><p>\"Becareful, David. He is getting heavy,\" she warned. Samson had doubled in weight thislastweek thanksto some advice from Avis, the innkeeper's wife. The woman had riddento the castle with thefirst delivery of ale and mead and had arrived as Avelyn wastryingto findsome way to feed the piglet. Avishad taken an interest and told her what her own father had done when they'd had a similar problemwith a foal. Her father hadmade asort of bladder out ofoiled cloth. He'd sewntheend intheshape of a teat, filledit withgoat's milkand useditto feed the foal,which had apparently done rather well onthe substitute fora mother's breast milk.</p><p>Avis offered to help with theproject, andAvelynhad accepted gratefully. She liked the innkeeper's wife, and theywere becomingfriends. So whenAvelynhad headed into the village today to order moregoods and check on the carpenters' progress withthefurnishings,she'd decided to take Samson with herto show Avis howwell her suggestion was working. Samson had become plump, healthyand happy.</p><p>Now they werereturning,and Avelyn was eager totell Diamanda about their trip.</p><p>Theyounger girl had been pleasantenough before, butever since their trip to the village, the twoof them werebecomingfast friends, spending a gooddeal oftime together and laughing and chatting as they went about their chores. In fact, Diamanda had wantedto comewith her to the village today,but thegirl's aunthad refusedto allow it. Lady Helen insisted Diamanda remain home to practice her seams, as she was stillunable to getthem straight.</p><p>Avelynsuspected the girl would be as bored asmudby now, andwondered if she was watching froma window andcouldsee them approaching the gates to the bailey.</p><p>\"He issquirmy. \"</p><p>Avelyn smiled faintly and glanced down at David's claim, just in time to see Samson wiggle his way outof the boy's hold. Dropping to the ground with aplop, the pigletraced off along the wall,andDavid promptlygavechasewith a squealthat justseemed to urge Samson tofaster speeds. Avelynsetoff after the pair, worried thatthe lad would trip over his ownfeet.</p><p>Sure enough, Davidtooka tumbleaftera coupleof minutes,and Avelyn shook her head asshe slowed to a walk to approachhim. She knewher husbanddid not like anyone making a bigdealof the child'stumbles, so shepaused beside himand raised her eyebrows as Samsonturnedback and waddled over to snuffle athim.</p><p>David giggledas he crawled to hishands and knees, then snuffled back.</p><p>Avelyn shook herhead atthepair ofthem, andthen bentto scoopSamson into herarms as David climbed to his feet.</p><p>\"You have some dirtonyour braes,\" she announced, and was waiting patiently as he brushed itaway when a grinding sound overhead madeher glanceup. Avelyn's eyes widened in horror at the sight of a stone block plummeting down toward them from the wall. For asplit second, she wassure her heartstopped;then sheshouted and lunged forward, pushing David beforeher as she tried to get them out of the way.</p><p>A grunt of pain slid from her lips as her shoulderwas struck a glancingblow;then the three of them were falling. Avelyn let go of Samson, hoping to keep from crushing the piglet while tryingto avoid falling on David. Then she hitthe ground witha crash that sent a jolt throughherwhole body.</p><p>\"Are you all right, my lady?\"</p><p>Younger andmoreused totumbles, David was the first torecover and crawled over to peer at her.</p><p>Avelyn took a minute to catch her breath. Then she sat up, rubbed the pain from her shoulder and manageda smile as Samson wiggled between them. \"Aye. I am fine, thank you,David. Were youhurt?\"</p><p>\"Nay. \" He offered a handtohelpherup, and Avelyn accepted it even though she actually got to her feet under her own steam. The boy wasn't big enough to trulyhelp her, but shewouldn't rebuff his attempt at chivalry.</p><p>\"Lord Paen will blame me,\" David saidmiserably, drawing Avelyn's surprised attention.</p><p>\"Why would he dothat?\" sheasked as hergaze drifted up thewallto where the cut stone hadcome from. Avelynfrozeas she spotted Diamanda withdrawing from thewall directlyabovethem. Theblonde hadobviouslybeen leaningover, peering downat them from the spot wherethe cut stone hadbeen, but hadpulledback as Avelyn glanced up. Onesecond slower and Avelyn would havemissed seeingher.</p><p>\"Well, afterthe boulder nearly hit me while I waswith him, hemademe stop going with him to the wall everyday. He said I wouldget myself killed, and one dead squire wasenough,\"David said, reminding her ofhis presence.</p><p>Avelyn glanceddown to seehis eyeswiden with alarm.</p><p>\"Youdo not think hewill makeme stop spending time withyouand Samson now, do you?\"</p><p>Avelyn staredat David blankly, finding itdifficult to draghermind fromtheimage of Diamandapeering down at them. What had she been doing up there? Had the stone blockreallyjust fallen accidentally?</p><p>\"Hewill!\". theboy cried unhappilywhen sheremained silent. \"Oh, pleasedo not tell himaboutthis, mylady. He will make me stop spendingthe day with youand Samson. Please do nottell - \"</p><p>\"Iwill not tell,\" sheassured himquietly,but had reasons ofher own tokeep this toherself. Avelynneeded to do somethinking. She considered Diamanda her friend, but there were so many questions whirling through her head at themoment... She thought suddenly ofthe ruined tunic saturated with the scentof pork,and the plank slamminginto her head and sending her through theholein the floor. And now a stone block had nearly crushed herand David... and Diamanda hadbeen standing upthere, directly where the cut stone had been.</p><p>But Diamanda washer friend, she argued with herself. Avelyn trulyliked the girl.</p><p>Of course, that didn'tmean the girl truly liked her back, she acknowledgedwith a sigh. However, her friendshipwithDiamanda madeher feel sheowed it to the girlto talk to her beforetellingPaen aboutthe incident.</p><p>Of course,Avelyn wasn't a fool. IfDiamandadid mean her harm,shewould be an idiottoconfront her inprivate. She decidedshe would confront Diamanda infull view ofothers,just farenough away to be out of hearing.</p><p>\"Thank you, my lady. \" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Avelynpatted David'sshoulder,then bent to scoop upSamsonand urged the boy to hurry towardthegateinto the bailey. Theyhad taken several stepsinside the gate when she thought of the guards on the wall. SurelyifDiamandahad pushed the stone blockoff, the man stationed along that section of wall would have shouted or at least seen her. She turned to look towardwhere the guardusually stood, onlyto find it empty. it wasn't until she slid her gaze along thewallthat she spotted aman mounting the stairs to thewall. As she watched, he walked back to his postand took uphis position.</p><p>\"Good afternoon, my lady. You look lovelytoday. \"</p><p>Avelyn glanced around, a blush coming to her cheeks as she nodded at the two soldiers approaching.</p><p>\"Aye, lovely,\" the second soldiersaid astheypassed.</p> <p>Avelyn wasshaking her head with bewildermentat the sudden penchanteveryone seemed to havefor complimenting her,when sheheard the first soldier say, \"Lovely was my compliment. Could you notcome up with your own?\"</p><p>\"LordPaen said compliment her, hedid notsay we had tobecreativeabout it,\"</p><p>the second man pointed outwitha shrug. \"Besides, what should I have said? 'Pretty pig, my lady?'Once you've tolda woman she islovely,there is little else tosayto her. \"</p><p>Avelyn turnedslowly towatch themen walk awayas thefirstsoldier shook his head and said, \"If that iswhat you think,'tis nowonder you have such troublewith women. \"</p><p>The men obviously had no idea they'd been speaking loud enough to be overheard. Avelyn turned a thoughtful glance to her husband's squire. \"David?\"</p> <p>\"Aye, my lady?\"</p><p>\"Did Paen tellthe soldiers to compliment me?\"</p><p>\"Aye, my lady. \" David nodded. \"Hesaidyou needed steam building dueto your nastyprick cousins and their years of damned evil insults and we wereall to aid in... er... preparing thedamage. \"</p><p>Avelyn bit her lip to hold backa chuckle. She suspected he meantesteembuilding andrepairing thedamage, buthe had certainly remembered Paen's curses.</p><p>Shaking her head, sheurged Davidtocontinueacross the bailey,but her thoughts were on what she'd just learned. Avelyn had been the recipient of countless compliments of late, andfound herself bothuncomfortable and embarrassed by it all, tothe point thatshe'd started to avoid the men. Nowsheunderstoodwhy she wasgettingso manycompliments: because Paenhad told them to. She wantedto cry. Herhusband had cared enough to tryto repair thedamagedoneby her'nasty prick cousins. ' The more she learned about her husband, the more she loved him. Avelyn stopped walking as she realizedwhat had just gone through her head. Love? Paen? Certainly she had the dutiful lovethat a wifewas supposed to have for herhusband - that was as itshould be - but she didn't low love him... did she? \"There you are. \"</p><p>Avelyn pulled backfrom her thoughts and smiledat the manin questionas Paen appeared before them.</p> <p>\"David, go inside and polish my mail at the trestle table,\" heordered. \"Do notgo anywhere without checking with Lady Helenfirst. \"</p><p>\"Aye, my lord. \"</p><p>Avelyn raised her eyebrowsas theboy hurried off.</p><p>\"LadyHelenagreed tokeep aneye onhim while wearegone,\" Paen announced, taking her arm and turning her around toleadher back the way she'dcome. She still heldSamson in her other arm.</p><p>\"Whilewe are gone where,husband?\" Avelyn asked, glancingcuriouslyat the sack and the folded fur he carried.</p><p>\"Tohave our lunch,\" he said, and her eyes widened.</p><p>\"Our lunch?Do you mean a picnic? We are having a picnic?\"she askedwith excited pleasure.</p><p>\"Aye,\" Paengrunted, but shecouldn't help noticingheappeared embarrassedto admit it. Avelyn supposedthatmeant this wasanother of the suggestionshis mother hadmade while shewas here. Lady Gervillehad toldher all about Paen's explaining thatthe rump patting and the handingover of an apple had beenhis ways of praising her. His motherhadfeared thatAvelyn might have taken offense at this \"praise\"and had hoped toprevent or repair it byexplaining his actions. Lady Gerville had also told her that she'd given Paen alternate waysto praise herand had suggested he also spend more time with her at pursuits such aschess and walks and so on. Avelynhad appreciated the suggestions this last week as she'd enjoyed her husband's company.</p> <p>For somereason,she hadn't minded thatthechessgames atnight andthe walks duringthe day were at LadyGerville's suggestion. Paenwanted to praise her and did followthe advicetospend time with her. That waswhatmattered.</p><p>Paen led her out of the bailey and into the woods, following a path he appearedto know. It wasn'tlongbeforethey came to a clearing with a small brook running through it.</p><p>\"Oh, this is lovely,\"Avelyn exclaimed, peeringaround as heset down thebagand began to lay outthe fur. \"How didyou know this washere?\"</p><p>\"Icameout yesterday on horseback and looked for a suitablespot. \"</p><p>\"And this spot isso nearby,\" Avelyn murmured, but her heart was squeezing at the factthathe'dlookedfor anice spot for them. Lady Gervillemay have suggested thepicnic,but Paenhad put careand trouble into finding a nice placeto have it. It gave her hope that he was perhaps coming to care forher, at least a little.</p><p>\"Sit,\" Paenordered oncethe fur was spread out.</p><p>Avelyn sat, a small smile playingabouther lips, then set Samsonon the fur. The piglet immediatelyset out on an exploration of the clearing. She watchedhim for a bit, but wasn'treally concerned that he would gofar. He never wandered too far from her unlesshe waswanting to be chased. Had Davidnot set outafter himtoday, Samson wouldhave stopped and come backonhis own.</p><p>Paenshook his head withamusement. \"I shouldhave had David take the little pest, but I did not notice you had him. \"</p><p>Avelyn's eyebrows rose. \"It is hard to believe youdid not notice I was carrying him, my lord. \"</p><p>Paen grimaced. \"I was distracted. \"</p><p>\"By what,mylord husband?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Iwas considering whetherI had forgottenanything,\"he said.</p><p>Avelyn smiled at theadmission. Not that Paen noticed, he was busy digging food out of the sackandsetting it on the blanket. His face was a pictureof concentration as he worked, and she felt her heartswell as she watchedhim. How she didlove this man. Yes,she did. He mightsay little, but his actions spoke loud and clear. Paen put care into things that matteredto him - his castle, his horse...and her. The factthat he hadtaken great carein findingtheperfect spot for their picnic was only onein a list of examples. Hehad takenon the choreof chatelain at Rumsfeld becausehe'd thought she wasunhappy in not having a home ofher own to run. He had ordered his men to praise her tohelp raise her esteem. He hadstartedplaying chess withher and taking her forwalks, purely because hismothersuggested it would makeher happier. .</p><p>Beneath his gruffexterior, Paen was agood man. A caring man whom she loved, andwho she was beginning to hope might care forhera bit.</p><p>Paen raised his head andopened hismouth to speak,then froze as he caught the expression on herface. He satlike that for a minute, thenclosedhismouth, licked his lips and said, \"You lookall soft and glowing rightnow. \"</p><p>\"Do I, my lord?\"Avelyn asked softly.</p><p>\"Aye. You looklovely. \"</p><p>She smiled and admittedsoftly, \"You makemefeel lovelywhen you look at me like that. \"</p><p>\"Like what?\" Paen asked,beginningtoscowl.</p><p>Avelyngrinned at the defensiveactionand said,\"LikeI amadelicious dessert you wouldlike to gobble up. \"</p><p>\"Iwould. \"He began to lean toward her.</p><p>\"You would what, my lord?\" Avelyn asked breathily.</p><p>\"I would liketo gobble youup,\" he admitted. Thenhis mouthcovered hers. His lips were allthat touched her, brushing softly back and forth and feather-light.</p><p>Avelyn's eyes driftedclosed andshe sat still for a moment, but thenfound her lips drifting apartandherbodyleaningforwardof its ownaccord. She wanted morethan his teasingkisses. She wanted a proper kiss,shewantedto touch him, she wanted himtotouch her.</p><p>But the further Avelynleaned forward, the further Paen pulled back, forcing the kiss to remaina light brushing of mouths.</p><p>Just when Avelyn thought he would drive hermad with his teasing, she felt his tongue slip out to drift across her open lips. The intimate caress madehermoan,and her own tongue slidout until the tipof hers touchedhis. Paenimmediately slanted his head and pressed forward sothathis tongue couldthrust fullyinto her mouth.</p><p>Avelyn gaspedandkissedhimback. She raisedherhands to slip themaround his shoulders, but Paencaught them in his own and held on. It seemedhe was intenton drivinghermad, she thought witha touch offrustration; thenhe suddenlybroke the kiss and satback.</p><p>\"Take off your dress,\" he orderedhuskily.</p><p>Startled at the request, Avelyn blinked. Her mind struggled briefly, shyness battling with excitement;thenshe shifted to her knees, only to hesitate.</p><p>\"Please,\" Paen added. His gaze was hungry, hisexpression solemn.</p><p>Avelyn took a deep breath andslowly stood. A moment passed asshegathered hercourageandthenshe bent to catchthe hem of her gown and draw itup overher head. Avelyn immediately had a terrible urgeto hide behind the gown, butshe made herself release it to droptothe furs. It wasa decisionshe began to regret when Paen simply sat staring ather, his eyessliding over every inchof her exposedbody. Just as Avelyn reached thepoint whereshe decided shecouldstand it no more and must grab upher gown, Paen shifted tohis knees andleaned forward to brushthe tip of his thumb acrossoneerect nipple.</p><p>Avelyn bither lip and swallowed at the tingle the action caused. He thenleaned closerstilluntil he could takethe tightbud delicately between histeeth. Her heart immediately jumped in herchest. It jumpedagainwhen shefelt histongueflick over the tip in his mouth. Then he suddenly cupped one hand beneath her breast to hold it andbegan to suckle eagerly, his tonguerepeatedly flickingthe end ashe did.</p><p>Avelyn moanedand slid one handinto his hair, herringersholding onto the silky strands. He continued tolaveat first one breast, then theother, until Avelyn was trembling in his arms;then hebeganto ease down onhis knees so that he was trailing kissesdown across thedancing flesh ofherbelly.</p><p>\"Husband?\" Avelyngasped as hecontinued lower, his kisses shifting tothe side anddrifting overthe sensitive flesh that coveredherhip. His teethgrazed andnipped as he went, andAvelyn found herself unable tostandstill under the torment. She twisted her hips inhis hands,almost writhing against hisquesting mouth.</p><p>When Paen caughther ankles andforcedher toshift her stance sothat herfeet werefurther apart, Avelyn realized shewas breathing inshort, shallow pants. It only gotworse as his lipsburned a trail to the inside of her thigh. Avelyn was now holding herbreath, terrified herlegswould give out at any moment, leaving herto collapse atophim. As if awareof her weakness, Paen slid his handsto her hips,his fingers cupping herbehind and holding her up ashe pressed kisses higher and higher up her thigh.</p><p>Avelyn did her best to remain on her feet, but even with his support her legs gave out when he pressed akissto the very center of her. She collapsed with a gasped cry, andPaen caught her, easing herto her back onthe fur. He thenknelt between herlegs, nudged her legs further apart and ducked his head to presshis mouth toher again.</p><p>Avelyn caught at the furs and twisted her head, her mind awhirl with a combination ofexcitement, desireand the need to touch him. She wanted to please himtoo, and had wanted to eachtimehe'd bedded her, but Avelyn had no idea how todo so. This time,the need was almost unbearable,but his hands werepinningher thighs downas he used his lips, teethand tongue to pleasure her. Paen continuedto do sountilshe screamed out and bucked beneath him.</p><p>For a moment afterward, Avelynwas too dazedto move; then she becameaware thatPaen had sat backonhis haunchestolifthis tunic off overhis head.</p><p>When hethenstoodand reached for the waist of his braes, Avelyn shifted toher knees,taking thesame positionhe'dtakenbefore her earlier. Her voicewas husky. \"I wanttoplease youtoo. \"</p><p>Paen hesitated, bent to strip out of hisbraes, thenstraightened so thatshe found herselfstaringathismanhood. Avelyn hesitated. He was hardand erect and right before her face, but she wasn't sure what to do.</p><p>WhenPaen did not instruct her, she decidedshemightas well try whathehad done toher and leaned forwardto press akissto his hip. Shetrailedkissesto his thigh and then finally braved pressing a kiss to his staff. Avelyn found herself surprised at how soft and velvety theskin felt over the hard shaft. She pressed another kissto the shaft,then ran her lips lightly along it to the tip, whereshelaved himwithhertongue. After that,she wasn't sure what else to do.</p><p>\"Takeit in your mouth,\" Paen growled, soundingpained. Sheglancedup at his face with aconcern that only grew whenshe saw howhis facewas now scrunched upin what looked to be agony.</p><p>\"Am Idoing this wrong?\" sheaskeduncertainly.</p><p>Paen shook his head,thengasped when shetook him in her mouth. Hisheadwent back and he stood rockstill as she moved hermouth uncertainly overhim,then raised her hand and wrappedit around his manhood. Holding him in asimilar fashion to how he'dheld her breast, she suckledon him until he suddenly pulled awayand kneltbefore her.</p><p>Avelyn peered at him uncertainly. \"WasI doing it - \"</p><p>Her question died abruptly when his mouth covered hers. The kiss was so passionate, she thought perhaps she hadn't done it wrong after all; then Paen was bearing her down onto her back on the furs.</p><p>Avelyn wrappedherarms around hisshoulders and parted for him, expectinghim to enter her at once,buthe didn't,he just pressed himself against herashis lips claimed hers. Paenkissedherdeeply, his tonguethrusting, then turned hislips toone ear,lavingthatas well and sending shivers throughher.</p><p>Moaning, Avelyn turned her head and caught his lips with hers, kissing him passionatelyas she shifted against him, silently pleading with himto fill her. Muchto herrelief, Paenresponded to the request, thrusting into herwith a hard, deep stroke thatdrew a low groan from her throat. He then began to rideher, drawing moan after moan, gasp after gasp, as she writhed and shiftedbeneath him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her nails duginto his backtourge him on as her tongue wrestledwithhis.</p><p>When he tore hismouth from hers, Avelyn pressed herface against his shoulder andalternatelysucked andnipped attheflesh there as the tensionescalated through her whole body. It felt as if something hadbeen drawn as tight as a bow insideher andshe waspositive that if itwerepulled any tighter itwouldsurely break. Andthen suddenly it did, and she bucked beneath him, screaming as her body squeezed around him with each pulseof pleasure. Avelyn was hardlyaware of it when Paen thrust intoheronelast time and criedout his ownpleasure.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p> <p>Avelyn openedher eyesand staredwith confusion at theman's chest she lay on... untilshe recalled how their picnic had turned out. Theyhadn't touched the food, she remembered, and asmile curved her lips. Thensherealized she hadn't a clue astohow she'd ended up on Paen'schest. The lastthing she recalledwas Paen resting half on topof her asthey both waited torecover theirbreath. She must have fallenasleep. And Paen had obviously shifted off of her, then draped her over himself, allwithoutwaking her.</p><p>\"Wife?\"</p><p>Avelyn raised her head and peered shyly at her husband. As amazing as it seemed,shealways felt a little self-conscious after what theydid. She hadstood there completely nakedbefore him not long ago,but now wassuddenlyshy.</p><p>He smiledsleepilyat her expression. \"Areyou hungry?\"</p><p>Avelyn blinked,surprised both by the question and by the fact that she was indeedhungry. Nodding,sheslid off tosit onthe fur and reachedfor her gown, eagertocover up nowthatshe wasnolonger distracted by passion ordesire.</p> <p>Paen sat up beside her and began to dressas well, thenmoved tothe foodhe'd removed from the sack. Miraculously, they had managed not to crush any of it, which Avelyn wasgratefulfor. She really was terriblyhungry.</p><p>Theyate insilence at first;thenAvelyn asked how the wall was coming. Sheknew Paen had workedthe men hard on the wall untilhefelt it was safe to bring herto Rumsfeld, but he'd taken many of themen off theproject once they'd arrivedhere sothey could work on other tasks. Only himselfand a handful of menwere leftto continueworking on theremainingsmall holes and unstable bits of the wall.</p><p>Paen told her it was coming along well,which really said nothing at all, she thought. What she really wanted to know was if it was possible thatthe boulder couldhavefallen on its own. She really didn't wishto believeDiamanda was trying toharm her.</p><p>After another silence, duringwhich Avelynwonderedhow toget the information she wantedwithoutgiving anythingaway,she finally simply asked.</p><p>\"The section of walltothe right of the front gates?\"</p><p>\"Aye?\"</p> <p>\"Isit safe?\" she asked,then said, \"I mean,arethere any parts there you stillneed towork on?\"</p><p>\"The innerparapet needs to be replaced in places, but the outer parapet is sound. \"</p><p>\"There arenoloose stones that mightfall outor anything?\"Avelyn asked.</p><p>Something abouther tone madehim pause and peer at her. \"There should not be,\"he said slowly. \"Whyare youasking, wife?\"</p><p>She dropped her gaze and shrugged, turningher attention to Samson as the piglet returnedto the blanket and dropped to sit beside her now thatthey had stopped movingabout and had brought out the food. Avelyn set several slices ofapple and a plum ontheground bySamson, but hewasn't interested and merely nosed the fruit before taking himselfoff to explore somemore.</p><p>\"Why are you asking, wife?\"</p><p>She lifted her gaze, but hesitated. Avelyn wasn't concernedthat he would blame David and refuse to allow him to spend time with her and Samson. Shejust didn't want to bringup Diamanda until she herself knew ifthe girl had been involved.</p><p>Avelyn supposed she couldtell him about the stone block falling without mentioning Diamanda.</p> <p>\"Wife, what happened?\"he asked. \"Ihad noticed that the sleeve ofyourgown is torn and your shoulder bruised beneath. \"</p><p>She glanced towardher arm andsighed. Avelyn hadn't noticed eitherthe tear or the bruise after the incident,she'd beentoostunned anddistracted at thesight of Diamanda. Though shehad been aware of a vaguetwinge ofpain if she movedher arm a certainway.</p><p>\"One ofthestones fellout of the wall and nearlyhit Davidand me on our way back from the village,\" she finallyadmitted.</p><p>\"Another accident,\"Paenmuttered andsat back, his face pale and his mouth tight.</p><p>Avelyn shifted, feeling suddenly guilty. She wassurePaen must thinkher a plague of accidents.</p><p>\"When wereturn, Iwantyou to show me where you were when the stone fell. \"</p><p>Avelynnodded. The pleasantfeel to the outing had suddenly disappeared,and she was sorryto see it go. Paen must have felt it too, for after a fewmoments of silence,he sighed and begantopack things away.</p><p>\"Get yourpigandwe shallheadback. \"</p><p>Avelyn rose silently and went tocollect Samson from where hewas nosing in the bushes. When sheturned back,Paen was standing staringat her. He started across the fur, thensomething went wrong. Avelyn squeezed Samson in surpriseas Paen suddenlyseemed to stumble; then his foot slid out from beneathhim and he crashed forward, hitting his head on a log.</p><p>\"Husband?\" Avelyn rushed forward, anxiety clawingather stomach. Hewasn't moving.</p><p>\"Paen?\" Dropping Samsonas she reachedher husband'sside, Avelyn managed withsome effort to turn Paen onto his back. She peered athis pale face. Hewas out cold,and there was acut on his foreheadwhere he'd hit it on the log. Alarge lump was alreadyforming beneath it.</p><p>A little frantic now, Avelyn bent her head and pressed her ear to his chest, relaxing only alittle when she heard the steady beat ofhis heart.</p><p>Sighing, she sat back andglanced around the clearing,unsurewhat todo. Head woundswerea trickything, and there was no telling how long herhusband would be out. Hisheadwould be terribly sore when he woke up... but whenhe woke up was the issue. Paen could be out for moments or hours or... Avelyn peered around the clearing and the trees that enclosed it. She had no desireto stay the night there alone with herhusband unconscious and unable to defendhimself. While he'd had his men riding patrolto make theirpresenceknown, and seemed tothink thatwould scare offthe reavers, she wasn'twilling torisk his life on it.</p><p>Unfortunately, Avelyn also wasn't willingto leavehim while she went for help.</p><p>They hadn't walked that far,but a lot could happenin the shorttimeit took her to get tothe castle and backwith help. That was one lessonAvelyn had learned well since her marriage. Ithad only takena momentforher to be knockedinto the hole in the floor, and ithadtakenless than that for the stone toplunge from the wallabove her.</p><p>Anythingcould happen to Paen while shesoughthelp. No,she would not leavehim alone while she went to fetch help... which meant, she supposed, thatshe would have to take him to help.</p><p>Avelyn's brother had alwaysaccused herofbeingoveroptimistic, but optimist though shewas,evenshe hadto admitthat it was unlikely that she'd be able to get herhusbandto the castle - orevenfar enough outof the woods for the menon the wall to noticethem. She could not possibly carry him, anddragging him byhis arms or legs through thedirt and grass wasn'tlikelyto do himmuch good. Then her gaze dropped to thefur helay on, and Avelynhadan idea.</p><p>Calling Samson over, she gottoherfeetandconsidered the furandherhusband's position on it and decided it might work. Sherolledhim into the fur. Pickingup the bagof leftovers he'd collected, sheset them on the fur beside herhusband, pausing when shesaw the squashed bitsofappleand plumon the fur. Avelyndistinctly recalled setting itout for Samson. She also recalled the piglet'slackof interest. She should have thrown the bits of foodinto thewoods or returned themto the bag, but she'd thoughtlesslyleft them lyingthere. Apparently, theywere whathad sent Paen crashing to the ground.</p><p>This was all her fault,Avelyn realized guiltrly, then pushed the guilt aside and bent to pick up the endsof thefur. Taking one cornerineach hand, she stepped back andtugged experimentally, releasinga sign ofrelief when the fur slid alongthegrass carpet with abitof effort.</p><p>Aye, she could do this,Avelyn told herself. She turnedher backto the fur,then switched her hold and began topull. The spot Paen had found for them hadn't seemed far into thewoods on theway out. It seemed much furtheraway on the return journey. Avelyn didn't give up, however, and eventually managed to get them out of the woods.</p><p>Avelyn pausedonce past the trees andwaved towardthegate, but hadno idea if themen could see her. She couldn't make out any figures on the wall. Sighing, she turned toglance at Paen, a faintsmile curving her lips whenshesawthat Samson haddecidedtohitch a ride on Paen'schest.</p><p>Shaking her headat the picture, Avelyn took upthecorners of the fur againand continued forward. Shehadn'tgone much further when several horses rodeout of the castle gates, hurryingtoward them.</p><p>Exhaustedby her efforts, Avelynkept her explanations to aminimum assheand Paen were both takenup on horseback to rideback to the keep. David metthem in thebailey. The boyhad run halfway to the gates,but turned andbegan torun back tothe keep steps when he saw the party ride in. The squirewas smart enough notto ask questions, but simply hurriedalong at Avelyn's side as she directed the mento take her husband up to theirroom.</p><p>DiamandaandLady Helen rosefrom wherethey satby the coldhearth in the hall and hurried forward as theyentered. Waving their questionsaway, Avelyn led the menupstairs,openingthe chamberdoor forthem to carryhiminside.</p><p>\"My lady!\" Runilda rushed acrossthe roomas they entered, concern on her face.</p><p>\"What happened?\"</p><p>\"Hefelland hit hishead, Runilda. Fetch my medicinals,\"sheordered brusquely, then added,\"And my needle and thread. His head has yet tostopbleeding, and I fear he may need stitches. \"</p><p>\"How did he fall?\" Diamanda asked with a frown, having heard Avelyn's explanation to Runilda asshe'dfollowed the men into the room.</p><p>\"He set his foot downon a plum, itslipped out from underhim and senthim crashing to the groundwhere he hit hishead on alog,\" she said as the menset Paen on the bed of furs she and Paen wereusing until the new bed was made. Avelyn could not even look at the girl as she explained. In her mind, she kept seeing Diamanda's blonde head disappearing back over thewall.</p><p>\"Here you are, my lady. \" Runilda handed her the small bag that held her medicaments, needle and thread.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Avelynmurmured and moved to kneel on the furs beside her husband.</p><p>Paen was still pale, still unconscious and still bleeding from the cut to his forehead. The only change was that thebumponhis foreheadhadalmost doubled in size. Themanhadhit the log hard.</p><p>Avelyn managed to find her needle and thread, but only after dumping the contents ofher bagonto the furs. When she wentto thread theneedle, she found thatherhands were shaking so hard she couldn't seem to do it.</p><p>\"My maidis a healer,\" Lady Helen saidgently when Avelyn triedforthethirdtime andfailed. \"Perhaps I should send forher, child. \"</p><p>Avelyn sagged with defeat and nodded,thenremainedsilent astheywaited for the woman to be brought to the room. Avelyn's mind was whirling. She had been beratingherself for beinga failure as a wife... but not now. She wasn't useless. She was proving herself a good wife. Her hands wereshakingbecause she cared so much and feared forPaen's well-being. That wasn't failure. Nor was it failureforone toaccept aid when it was needed.</p><p>When the door opened and Lady Helen's maid, Joan, entered,Avelyn at firstfelt relief. Joan was atall, thin,quiet woman, andone could forget herpresencemost of the time,but when she walkedinto theroom to tend to Paen,she movedwith a quiet confidence that suggested sheknewwhatshe wasabout.</p><p>Avelynwasrelievedto hand the burden ofher husband'scare tothe woman... untilJoan straightened from examining him and said, \"Ishall need my leeches. \"</p><p>\"What?\"Avelyn gaped at her, appalled. Her mother had trainedher in careand medicinalsand held no respect forthe practice of usingleeches to bleed a patient.</p><p>She saidit wasa nonsensicalthing to do, bleeding a body that was already bleeding.</p><p>\"Nay. \" Avelyn rose up on her knees. \"There will benoleeches. \"</p><p>\"He must be bled,\" the woman said reassuringly. \"We must remove the bad humors. Iwill return directly. \"</p><p>\"No,you will not return, youare notlooking afterhim,\"Avelynsnapped,then glanced at the men hovering around thefurs. \"That woman is not to come back in here. Keep her out. \"</p><p>\"Avelyn, dear,\" Lady Helen saidsoothingly. \"Do calm down. Joanknowswhat she is doing. Her mother was the finest healer I know, and she taught her everything. \"</p><p>Avelynturned flashing eyes onDiamanda's aunt. \"Well, my mother is the finest healerI know, and shealways despised the use ofleeches asa fool'stool. Iwill tend himmyself. \"</p><p>\"As youwish,\"Lady Helen said stiffly, and moved to usher Joan out of the room.</p><p>Avelyn felt a moment'sregret for snapping at Diamanda's aunt when she had only been trying tohelp,butit was only a moment's regret. She had more important things to worryabout. Takinga deep breath,shepicked up theneedle and thread again and concentrated onthreadingthe needle. Much toher relief, this timeher hands were steady enough that she managed the task. It was asiftherelease ofher fear and angerinher outburst over Joan'sleeches had removed whatevernervous energy had setherhands shaking inthe first place.</p><p>Avelyn quickly cleaned the wound, then bent tostitch it. It was a small cutand neededonlythreestitches, but she tooktime and care withthe chore, hopingto reduce the scar her husband would carry. Of course, sheloved the man and no scar, small orhuge,was going to change that. She took care forhis sake, though she doubted he wouldcaremuch either.</p><p>Paen remainedunconscious throughout,and Avelyn satback with a little sigh whenshe finished. She was half relieved that he'd not woken while she'd been pokingthe needle through his skin, and half wishinghe had so that she would at least knowhewasgoingto be all right. Avelyn hadseenmen live through much worse head wounds than Paen had, but shehad also seen men dieafterlesser wounds. It was whythose wounds were tricky. One never knewwhich waythe patient would go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Willhe be all right?\" Diamanda asked as Avelyn began to wrap a bandage around his forehead.</p><p>\"I do not know,\" she admitted, then glanced at Runilda. \"Please fetch me something to mix themedicinalsin,Runilda. His headwill ache whenhe wakes,and I would have a tonic hereto helphim sleep sothat he may drinkit as quickly as possible. \"</p><p>Nodding, the maid hurried fromthe room. After a pause,the soldierswhohad been hovering began to fileout of the room as well, leavingDiamanda and Avelyn alone.</p> <p>They sat in silence forseveral minutes, but the silenceseemedto make thegirl uncomfortable and she cleared herthroat. \"It was most impressive when youdealt withJoan. She has always made me nervous,and I could never faceup to eitherher or Aunt Helen like youdid. \"</p><p>\"I wasrude toyour aunt andshall have to apologize,\" Avelyn muttered. \"But leeches are the signof an unskilled healer. \"</p><p>\"Idislikeleeches too,\" Diamanda murmured.</p><p>When Avelyn didn't respond, the girl frowned slightlyand asked, \"Areyou angry at me forsome reason?\"</p><p>Avelyn peered at the girl she'd thought ofas her friendand could holdher silence nomore. \"I saw you, Diamanda. I knowwhatyou did. \"</p> <p>Diamanda'smouth dropped open, andthey staredat oneanother insilence, both stiff and un-moving; then the girl drooped like a flower toolong without water.</p><p>\"I - \"She shook her head, thenblurted,\"I am sorry, Avelyn. I truly am. It was stupid and mean,andmyonly excuse is that I hardly knew you then and we had not yet become friends. You cannotknow how much Iregret it now. \"</p><p>Avelyn blinked in confusion. Whileit was true theyhad not been as closewhen she hadbeen knocked through the hole in the floor, they had certainly beenfriends today, when the girl hadsentthestone block crashing down. Or was thatwhat she was confessing?</p><p>Avelynshifted, trying to thinkof a way to get the girl to talk withouthavingto admit that she wasn't sure what they were presently talking about. \"Help me understand. Tell mewhatyou were thinking. Tell me everything from the beginning. \"</p><p>She held her breathafterthat suggestion, hoping it wouldwork. When the silence drew out a painful lengthof time, Avelyn began to think the girl wouldn't say anything at all. Butit seemed she was just collectingher thoughts,for she finally sighed and began to speak.</p><p>\"I wassix whenI came to Gerville. I knew I was tomarry Adam, but from the very first day I have alwaysloved Paen,\"she admitted.</p> <p>Avelyn satback on her heels,hermind blank.</p><p>\"When news came to Gerville that Adam had died,\" she continued, \"I was positive it was fate making sure that Paen andI could be married. Idid not know aboutyou. Noone ever spoke to me about your betrothal,and Paen was so much older than Adam and still unmarried, so I thought hewas not betrothed to anyone, or that his betrothedhad died. But then Paen returned and they announced we must pack and get readyto travel to Straughton so thatPaencould fulfill hismarriage contract. \"</p><p>Diamanda grimaced. \"I amafraid I hated youat once, without everhavingmet you. You were stealing my Paenfrom me,\" she said sadly, then smiled wrylyand added,\"I hatedyou evenworse once I met you. \"</p><p>\"Why?\" Avelyn gasped with surprise.</p><p>\"Because you weresobeautiful and niceand - \" Shepausedabruptly, frowning whenAvelyn gavea shortburst oflaughter.</p><p>\"Diamanda, Iam hardly beautiful. \"</p><p>\"Aye, you are,\" shesaid solemnly. \"Youare notthin, but you are beautiful. \"</p><p>Avelyn blinked at this announcement.</p> <p>\"Anyway,thenwhenwe were traveling to Hargroveand you showed me the tunic andbraes you were makingfor Paen, I becamequite upset. They were lovely, and it was so thoughtful of you to thinkof it,andIimmediately wishedIhad thought of it, but evenif I had, I cannot sew as wellas youand itwouldnot work outas well. So when I realized youwere nearly done and wouldpresent themto Paen, I was in a panic. \" She took a deep breath, thenadmitted,\"When Paen took you down to the river, I snuck intothe tent and set thefurs and clothesonfire. \"</p><p>\"Idid blowout thecandle,\" Avelyn said on a sigh, and Diamanda nodded.</p><p>Recalling the scentof pork on the second set of clothes she'dstarted for Paen, Avelyn asked,\"And yourubbed porkon the second tunic andletthe dogs have at it. \"</p><p>Diamanda grimaced. \"Thatwas the plan, but theyaretoo well trained and would nothave at it. I had to tearand cut thetunicmyself, then leftit for them to be blamed. \" She sighed unhappily. \"Iamsorry now,Avy. I started to like you despite myself once wewere here, andIbegan to see that youtrulycaredfor Paenand he was coming to care for you. The two ofyou are perfecttogether. I know what I did was wrong, andIamsorry about hurting and upsettingyou. I hope youwill forgive me. \"</p><p>Avelyn stared at her, confusion claimingher again. \"But what about the wall, Diamanda?\"</p><p>\"The wall?\" Now it was the blonde's turn to stare at her blankly.</p><p>\"Isaw you on the wall,\" Avelyn announced.</p><p>\"When? Do you mean today?\" She truly seemedconfused. \"Aye, I went up there to think. Icame acrossPaen while he wasarranging the foodforthepicnic,and he was taking so muchcare and making such an effort... It was just anotherbit of evidence that helovesyou. Did you know he ordered the mento compliment youto try to helprepairthe damage your cousins' insultshad caused? He doeslove you, Avelyn, andafter only a couple of weeks. Whereas hehas known me for yearsand years and cares for me as nothing more than a little sister. \"She shookher head. \"I guess despite everything, it really sankin then and I went up on the battlementsto be alone. Iwas walking along andheard talking and paused to peerover the wall. I did see you and David,but did not realize you had seen me. \"</p><p>Avelyndropped back onher haunches. She was positive Diamanda wastelling thetruth. Thegirl could notfake suchinnocence andbewilderment. Diamandahad no clue as totheimportance of her being upon the walkway, because she hadno idea that aboulder had nearly crushed AvelynandDavid moments beforeher arrival.</p><p>Avelyn was sure ofit.</p><p>Perhaps the falling stone had beenan accident,she thought faintly. But then, who hadhit her and knockedherinto theholein the floor?</p><p>\"You must hate me now,\" Diamanda said miserably, and Avelyn frowned.</p><p>\"Nay, of course not. \" She reached out totakethegirl's hand,giving it a squeeze, relieved toknow thatthegirl sheconsidereda friend hadnot set out tokillher. Of course,she had ruined Avelyn's attempts at sewing clothes for Paen,but she could forgive that. She might have been more angry had she known who was behind it at the time,but it allseemed solong ago, and shetruly believedDiamanda was sorry.</p><p>\"If you want me to leave, I shall return toGerville,'' Diamanda offered,though it obviously painedhertodo so.</p><p>Avelyn shookher head. \"That is notnecessary, Diamanda. Weare friends,and friends forgive friends forfoolish behavior. \" She shrugged. \"Youmade a mistake, you haveadmitted it and apologized. That is good enough forme. \"</p><p>\"Truly?\" Diamanda peereduphopefully from beneath her lashes.</p><p>\"Aye. \"</p><p>\"You willstill be my friend?\"</p><p>\"Most definitely,\" Avelyn said firmly. \"I enjoy our friendship, Diamanda. \"</p><p>\"Oh, Avy!\" She suddenlylaunchedherself at Avelyn, hugging her tightly. \"Truly, you arewonderful! Thank you. I promise, you willnot regretit. From now on, I shall be the best friend ever. \" Sheshook her head and sat back totakeAvelyn's hands. \"I cannot believe I thought youlucky to havePaen. In truth, I think weareall luckythat he got to marry you. \"</p><p>Avelyn smiled at the girl'sexuberance and foundherselftouched by her words.</p><p>Then Diamanda glancedat Paen and frowned. \"I shallhave to tell Paen, Of course. \"</p><p>\"Ido not think that isnecessary,\" Avelynassured her.</p><p>\"Would you keepitsecret from him, then?\" Diamandaraised one eyebrowand shookher head. \"Itwouldnever work. Oneday you wouldslip and say something that made the whole pitiful talecome out, and thenhe would be angry it waskept a secret from him. Besides, he has aright to knowyou arenot as accident proneas he thought. \"</p><p>\"Iam notaccident prone at all,\" Avelynassured her.</p><p>Diamanda shook her head in disbelief. After a hesitation, Avelynasked, \"Do you think you could watch over Paen for me for a bit? I need to go check on something. \"</p><p>\"Aye, Of course. Go ahead. I wouldbe more comfortable telling him everything aloneif he wakesup, and Ishall fetchyou directly afterwardif he does awake. \"</p><p>Avelyn hesitated, considering telling her again that she needn't confess her mischiefto Paen,but then decidedto let hergo aheadand tell him. Diamanda was right that itmight slip out someday and cause unnecessary upset. And Avelyn trustedPaen to handle Diamanda with care.</p><p>\"Fine. Ishall not be too long, I just wish to check on something up on the battlements. Send someoneto fetchmeif Paenwakes up and youfinish yourchat before Iget back. \"</p><p>Up on the parapet, Avelynran herfingers lightlyoverthe spot where the stone blockthat had nearly hit her had rested. She then leaned over to peerdown at the boulder below. Avelyn's talk with Diamanda had made herbegin to believe that the falling stonetruly hadjustbeen anaccident, butshe'd known she wouldn't be fully convinced untilshe hada look atwhere thecut stone had come from. She ranher hand across the spotagain.</p><p>There was nothing here to suggestthat anyonehad pushed itover the side. There werenochisel marks, or any marksat all thatwouldsuggest it had been levered out.</p><p>On the other hand,it was hard to believe thatit had chosen to fall at the exact moment she was walking by. Avelynfrowned asherfinger ran over theslightridge in the center of the outside edge of where the boulderhadbeen. Bendingcloser,she ranher hand over thearea and saw that therewasa slightly upraised portion onthe outer edge. The boulder would hadhad toroll up over it.</p><p>Thisboulder, if it hadfinally justgiven way,should have rolled theoppositeway, onto the walkway whereshe now stood.</p><p>Avelyn straightenedslowly. Someone had pushedf the boulderdownon her. Not an accident. Like her fall through the room. Shehad beenhit and knocked through the hole. Only her skirt catching on theragged edge ofthe wood had saved her.</p><p>So she was lessaccident prone than someone would have her believe, and the fatescertainly hadn't turned on her. Someone else had.</p><p>Avelyn stareddown intothebailey, considering the matter. Diamanda hadlooked so confused when she mentioned thefalling rock, she wassure she'd had nothingto do with it. But if not her,who?</p><p>Lord and LadyGervillecertainly had no reason towish her dead. Actually,no one did thatshe could think of. Diamandawas the only one whomightcomeclose tohaving an excuse to wish her dead. Still, shecouldn't believe it was thegirl.</p><p>A scuffle to her rightmade her glanceto the side, and Avelyn straightenedas she peered at Diamanda'saunt.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Paen opened hiseyes and shifted inbed, thensucked in ahissing breath of air as painshot through his head. It wasonly then that he recalled slippingon the plumand hitting his head on the log. He was grimacingover his own clumsiness when a sniffling sound drew his gazeto the side to see Diamandaseated on thewindow ledge, weeping intoa bit of cloth.</p><p>His first thoughton seeing thegirl was irritation thatshe must have wokenhim withherweeping. Paenwas inenough pain that he'd rather sleep than stayawakeand suffer it. His nextthought was to wonderwhy the girl was crying. It could not be over him. He was injured but would heal. It wasn't as if he were dying.</p><p>Butwhatof Avelyn? Paen thoughthis heart might stop ashe realized the girl might be crying because Avelynhad beenhurtagain...or evenkilled this time. Hiswife had sufferedan unfortunate number ofaccidents fromwhich she had man-agedto survive relativelyunscathed, but her luck wasbound to giveout eventually.</p><p>\"Whereis Avelyn?\"Colored withhis worry, the question came out sharperthan he'dintended.</p><p>Diamanda stopped weeping and turned astartled face his way, then slidoff the windowledgeandmovedtothe bed. \"You are awake. \"</p><p>\"Where isAvelyn?\" Paen repeated. \"Was shehurt? Is that why you were crying?\"</p><p>\"Oh!\"The blonde'seyes widened as sherealized what hercryinghad led himto believe. She quickly shookherhead. \"Nay. She is fine,Paen. Truly. \"</p><p>Paen relaxed backinto the bedof furs, realizingonly then thathe'd half sat up in his worry. Grimacing overthe pain allthe movement was causing him, he sighedand askedwearily, \"Then why were you weeping?\"</p><p>Diamanda satdownon the edge ofthebed with a sigh. \"Because ofwhat I have totell you. \"</p><p>Paen waited,andwhenshe merelysat there sniffling,askedimpatiently, \"What?\"</p><p>DiamandabitherUp, then stared at her hands and said, \"You will hateme. \"</p><p>She wantedto be coaxed into tellinghim, he realized witha sigh. Paen really was not in the mood for such games. \"Just tell me, Diamanda. \"</p><p>\"I am the one whodestroyed the tunic and braes Avelyn was making for you,\"</p><p>she admitted unhappily.</p><p>Paen frowned. \"Whichones?\"</p><p>\"Bothsets,\" she admitted in a bare whisper. When Paen openedhis mouthto speak, Diamanda rushed on. \"Avelyn had blown out the candle in the tent. I deliberately relit it and usedit to set the furs andclothing onfire. Then at Gerville, when she was nearly donewith the second pair,I snuck some meat from dinner awayfrom the table andrubbed it allover the tunic, then ripped itup and putholes initbefore Iused it toteasethe dogs. I left it with them, knowing they would be blamed. \"</p><p>She wasnow shredding the linen inher hands. \"Itold Avelyn all this a little while agoandapologized. I toldherI intended to tell you. Shesaid I need not tell you,that the mischief had been made against her and so long asshe forgave me - \"</p><p>\"She forgave you?\"Paen asked.</p><p>\"Aye. \" Diamandanodded. \"Shewas very understanding. \"</p><p>Paenstaredather withbewilderment. He was glad his wife was understanding, but hedidn't understand atall. \"Why did you do it?

Ihave always lovedyou. I came to Gervilleknowing I wasto marryAdam, but it was you I loved. You werealwaysstronger andsmarter and...\"</p> <p>She shookherheadhelplessly. \"I loveyou. And I wasjealous that she got tomarry you and wouldbe your wife and...\" She sighed. \"I wantedto make her as miserable as Iwas, I guess. Or maybe make you see howuseless and clumsyshe was. \"</p><p>\"Avelyn is neither useless nor clumsy,\"Paen saidgrimly.</p><p>\"I know. \" Diamanda nodded. \"Her cousins toldme she was, andthat just made me angrier because I thought she didnot deserve you. But Ihave come to know Avelyn sincethen andI know she isneitherclumsynoruseless. Sheis smartand funny and kindandI hope that I am half as good awife someday asshe is to you. \"</p><p>She shrugged unhappily. \"I came tolike her.

Ido like her,Paen. And I am sorry. \"</p> <p>Paenlethisbreath outon a slow sigh. The girl sounded sincere, atleast about beingsorry. He didn't believe foraminute that she really loved him. She had a child's infatuation for him, was all, andwouldgetover it soon enough. Her behavior toward Avelynhad been appalling, however, and he wasn't surewhat he should do about it.</p><p>\"So Avelynknows all this and forgave you?\"he asked.</p><p>\"Aye. She is verykind. \"</p><p>\"Iam surprised that you confessed allthis to her,\"Paen acknowledged.</p><p>Diamandagrimaced. \"She mademe. \"</p><p>\"What?\"</p> <p>Diamandanodded, then frowned. \"It was theoddest thing. Avelyn was angryand said she knew what Ihadbeendoingand had seen me. I thoughtshe meant shehad seen me either start the fire orruin thesecond tunicand I confessed all, but it just seemedto confuse her. And then she asked me about being up on the parapet earlier, as if itweremore important. \"</p><p>\"Earlier today?\"Paen asked sharply. \"You were up on the parapet today?\"</p><p>\"Aye. Iwantedto be alone to think about everything. Iwasfeeling bad for the unkindnesses I had dealt Avelyn, and I could see you hadcometo loveher, which only made me feeldoubly bad. \" Sheshrugged unhappily.</p><p>Paenstaredatthe girl,hisheart pounding. Shecould seehe hadcome tolove Avelyn? Nay, he didnot love his wife. Hemighthave someaffection for her, but love?Paen swallowed and glanced toward the window, a myriad of memories running through his mind - Avelyn chattering before himon hishorse; covered in quail eggs he'd knockedher into;telling him angrily that Of course she'd thought he preferred thehard-packed earth to beddingher, else hewould have been in their tent; herdejectionover hisnot bedding her; her gleefullaughas she beat himat chess;her earnest expression as she told him Samson was very smart; herbraveface as she denied she was inpain aftertheboulderhit her;her passion-filledgazeas he made lovetoher; her clutching a bit of linen infront of her as if itwould hide her nudity... Aye, he acknowledged. He lovedher. He loved every last contrary bit ofher. The woman was too kindhearted, too shy, too giving. Shewasjust plain perfect... for him. He loved her. Damn,whenhadthathappened?</p><p>\"I thought I could be alone up on the battlements. \" Diamanda went on,drawing Paen'sthoughtsaway from his love forhis wifein timeto see her grimace. \"Of course, I almost did not go up when I sawAuntHelen hurrying down, but Ihid underthestairs andwaited forher topass and then went up. \" She sighed. \"I was walking along the parapet and heard voices. Ilooked over and saw David helping Avelyn to her feet.

It scared me somuch, and still she will not admitshe is accident prone. \"</p><p>Diamanda sighed and peeredathim. \"Anyway,she must have seenme when I lookedover the parapet. Avelyn was very upset that I had been up there atfirst,then just looked mystifiedwhenI explained I had been up there to think. \"</p><p>Diamandastoodnow, then hesitated. \"If you wish me to leave, I will.

She then straightenedandmovedtothe door.</p><p>\"Diamanda?\"Paen asked as sheopenedthe door.</p><p>Pausing, thegirlglanced back.</p><p>\"Where isAvelyn?\"</p><p>\"She went up on the parapet for something. Though she may be backnow. Aunt Helen stopped in here looking for her for some reason, and Itold her where she was, so she may havefound Avelyn and brought her back down forwhatever she wanted.</p><p>I shall tell her youare awake if she isback in the keep when I gobelow. Avelyn will be glad. She was veryworried. Shelovesyou as muchas you love her, youknow. \"</p><p>Diamandaclosed the door softly behindherself as she left.</p><p>Paen stared after her, his heartin his throat for severalreasons. First, hehad just come torealize that he loved his wife. Secondly,Diamanda thoughthiswife loved him too, and third, he verymuch fearedhiswife was in terribledanger at that very moment.</p><p>Paen'smindwasworking fast, putting all the pieces together. He'd thought his wifeclumsy because ofall her little accidents, butit seemed that someof themwere not accidents at all. The fire inthetent hadnot been, the drowninghad not been a drowning... what else might not be whatit seemed? Hehad wondered about the fall through the hole inthefloor, findingit hard to believeshe could have missed seeing the hole. He stilldid, but he had never got to question her on it.</p><p>The chamber door opened, distracting him, and Paen glanced toward it as Runilda pausedin the entrance. Abright smile lither face asshe saw he wasawake.</p><p>\"Lady Avelynwill be happyyou areawake. She has been worried. \"</p><p>\"Wait,\" Paen said as she started toback out of the room, apparently togo find Avelyn.</p><p>Runilda paused, her eyebrows risingin question.</p><p>\"Come here,\"he ordered, not wanting anyone passingin the hall to hear him.</p><p>Runilda stepped back into the room, closed the door andapproachedthe bed.</p><p>\"Aye,mylord?\"</p><p>\"Did Avelyn ever talk to youaboutthefallshe took the first day here?When she fell through thehole?\"</p><p>Runilda hesitated. \"Not really,mylord. \"</p><p>Paen was frowning overthiswhen sheadded, \"Though, when she first woke up, she did say something about being hit and falling through. \"</p><p>\"Beinghit?\" Paenstiffened. \"What exactlydid she say?\"</p><p>Themaid thoughtfora minute, then said,\"I thinkit was'Someone hit me,I fell through the hole. '\"</p><p>\"Someone hit her?\" Paenasked with disbelief. \"Why did no one mention thisto me?\"</p><p>\"Well, she was alone upstairs; who could have hit her?Lady Helenseemedto think it had just been something Lady Avelyn had dreamed while she was unconscious,\"Runilda added apologetically.</p><p>\"Lady Helen did,did she?\" Paen asked,recallingDiamanda saying she'd hidden beneath the stairsas Lady Helenhad hurried off the battlements before she'd gone up onto thewall - which would put Lady Helen onthe wall rightabout when the boulder had fallen from the battlement and nearlycrushedhis wife. Was Helen trying tokill hiswife?Butwhy? And whynow? These more serious, deadlyattacks hadn't started until they'd arrived here at Rumsfeld. Or had they?</p><p>Paenran quickly through thelistof events at Straughton andon the journeyto Gerville.</p><p>Paen's thoughts pausedabruptly as herecalledone odd event on thejourney he hadn't put any significance to: the dead fox, the rabbit meat and the signs that someonehadbeensick in thewoodsbehind his wife's tent. He hadn't connected the two thingsat the time, but whatifthey were connected? Whatifthemeat hadbeen poisoned and the fox had diedafter eating some ofit?</p><p>\"Did Avelyn throwa roasted rabbit leg behindthe tent on the first night of our journey?\"Paen asked, making Runildastartle at the sharpquestion aftersuch a long silence.</p><p>\"Ido not know,\" she said, then frowned inthought and admitted, \"She mayhave.</p><p>Iknow Lady Helen gave a roastrabbit legto Diamanda to give to Lady Avelyn for sup. \" She shrugged. \"I have no idea whether she ateit or not,but her stomachmay have been bothering her after beingridden around camp across your horselike that, so she may havethrown it away rather than risk eating it and tossing it backup. \"</p><p>Or the ride around camp might have made her throw up the meatand savedher from being poisoned, Paen realized and sat up suddenly.</p><p>\"My lord, what are you doing? You should not be gettingup!\" Runildacried \"I have to getto the wall. Avelyn needs me,\" Paen growled, ignoring thepain ripping through his head as hegained his feet.</p><p>\"Good afternoon, Lady Helen,\" Avelynmurmured. The woman had frozenwhen Avelyn turned, and for a moment her expression had been of such hatred that Avelyn was startled. Then - as if it had never been there - the expression was replacedwitha smile, and she movedslowly forward. ButAvelyn had seen the look and could not pretend she hadn't. \"Hello, dear. I thought it was you uphere so I came tocaution you. It is not safe tobe hanging over the side of the wall as you werea moment ago. Accidents happen. \"</p><p>\"Aye,\"Avelynagreed, taking a step back along the wall. \"And they seem to happen to me a lot. \"</p><p>\"You do seem accident prone,\" Lady Helenmurmured, continuingforward.</p><p>\"Why?\"Avelyn asked, refusingto play ignorance. Themomentshe'd seenher expression, she'd known Lady Helen was behind the attacks. She just didn't understand why. Surelynot because Diamanda had an infatuation with Paen.</p><p>Lady Helen paused, her head tilting, and Avelyn knew she was debating whether to acknowledge what she'dbeen doing. Finally shesighedand took anotherstep forward. \"Ibear you no malice, Avelyn. \"</p><p>\"Judging by your expression amoment ago, I find that hard to believe. \"</p><p>Lady Helen grimaced. \"It gave me away, Of course. I amsorry. Ifearit is just frustration that causesmyirritation with you. Why will younot die?\"</p><p>Avelyn had no idea how shewas supposed to answerthat politequestion, so she simply took another step back.</p><p>Lady Helenmirroredher action. \"Four timesyoushould havebeen dead,and fourtimesyou haveescaped harm. I - \"</p><p>\"Four times?\" Avelyn interruptedwithamazement. She only knew of two.</p><p>\"You survived the poisoning twice, then the fall through the floor, and the boulder. \"</p><p>\"Poisoning?\"Avelyn gaped at her. \"When?\"</p><p>Lady Helen shifted with irritation. \"On the journeyfrom Straughton toGerville. I powdered poison on the bitof rabbit meatIhad Diamanda bringto you. Itis very potent poison and should have killedyouquickly, but instead of awaking to the shout thatyou were dead, I awokethenext morning tosee you wandering backto camp afterbathing. \"</p><p>Avelyn blinked as sherecalled the meat thefirst night. Hertongue had tingled after her first bite, but she'd bitten her tongue at the same timeand thought that the source. As sherecalled, she'd also felt as if ants were crawlingover her skin, buthad beendistracted by her stomach's revolt when she'd vomited the meat up. Avelynhad thought theroughtreatment of her stomach when Paen had riddenher around onher belly had causedher stomach's refusal to keepanything in it. And it probably had, she realized. Ithadalso saved her fromdying that night.</p><p>\"When thatdid notwork,\" Lady Helencontinued, takinganother stepcloser. \"I made stewthe next nightusingPaen's inability toeat withhis bandaged hands as the excuse. In truth, Iwanted to double the dosage ofthe poison,but feared it would be too obvious on roasted meat. I hoped the stew would hide it. \" She shook herhead with bewilderment. \"But even with double the dose,yousurvived. All it did was makeyou tired. \"</p><p>It hadn'tmadeher tired. Avelyn hadmadeherself tired by sewingthrough the night. The poison hadn't worked because Avelyn hadn't eaten the stew either. She'd beenfullfrom thecheese,bread and appleRunilda had brought her. Once again,fate had saved her. She didn't botherto tellLadyHelenthat, however. Insteadshesaid, \"And you did hit me with a plank,knocking methrough the hole?\"</p><p>\"Aye. I had gone out to check the gardens, but came back when you told Diamanda youwere tolookfor the servants above stairs. I stepped back into the kitchen andwaited for Diamanda to golookinto thematter ofthe well. Then once you were upstairs, Ifollowed. Those stairs were tricky,\" she said dryly. \"However, I managed themquickly and without scraping my leg as you did. \"</p><p>Avelyn didn't respond to the taunt,but simply waitedfor her to continue.</p><p>\"Ifound theplank in one ofthe roomsand carried it with me. When I discovered you,you were leaning over,peering down the hole. Before I could hurryforward and push you, youstarted to back away from the hole, so Iused the plank. \"Her mouth tightened. \"Butagain you escaped death. Your skirt caught on one of the broken floorboards. I would have moved forward tofree youto fall to your death, but Runilda wasscreaming to high heaven. I knew help would come quickly and I wasafraid she might seeme through the hole, so I hid in one of theroomsuntil Diamanda sent Runildatofetch Paen and hurriedupstairsto the room. ThenIcame in behind her as if Ihadjust come from outside. \" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Itake it, then, that youdid not prevent her from trying to pull me up because you feared she might dropme,\"Avelyn asked dryly, taking yet another step back.</p><p>\"Nay. She is strong and would have insistedIhelp, and the two of us might have savedyou. I was hopingyourskirt would yet ripand you would die ere Paen could get theretosave you. But,of course, that did not happen. \"</p><p>\"So youtried pushing theboulder on me next. \"</p> <p>Fury flashed acrossher face; thenshe took a deepbreath. \"You are the luckiest of creatures. \"</p><p>\"And thatangers you,\" Avelynguessed,recallingthe expressionof hatredshe'd caught on the woman'sfacewhenshe firstspied her.</p><p>\"I have taken great risks each time,\" Lady Helen pointed out shortly, then snappedwithfrustration, \"Why will you not die?\"</p><p>Avelyn took anotherwary step away. The woman lookedready tolaunch herself ather atany moment. Thiswas not the kind,motherly woman shehad cometo knowsince her wedding day. She couldhardly believe that the womanbeforeher was Lady Helen, and she still didn'tunderstand why the woman wanted her dead.</p><p>\"Why?\" sherepeatedherquestionof earlier.</p> <p>\"Why?\" Lady Helen peered at her as if shewere stupid not torealize the reason behind the attacks. \"ForDiamanda. \"</p><p>\"For Diamanda?\"Avelyn stared at her, thinking she mustbe mad.</p><p>\"Do not look at me like that,\" Lady Helen snapped, taking two quick steps forward.</p><p>\"Like what?\" Avelyn moved warilyback again.</p><p>\"Like I amcrazy. I amnot crazy. \"</p><p>Avelyn wasn't willing to debate that. Instead she asked, \"You would kill me because Diamandahas a child'sinfatuation with Paen?\"</p> <p>\"Do notberidiculous. \"LadyHelen looked impatient. \"I wouldkillyou because Adam died. \"</p><p>Avelyn blinked in confusion. \"I do notunderstand. \"</p><p>\"Adamwas betrothedto Diamanda. This wasto be their marital home according tothe marriage contract. \"</p><p>Avelyn glanced around with surprise. This was news to her. No one had mentioned it, and it madeherfeel abit bad thatthey were living there when it should have belongedto Diamanda and Adam. Avelyn then realized thatLady Helenhad backed her to asectionof thebattlementwherethe inner parapet - the section of wall that kept soldiers fromtumbling to their deaths in the bailey below during battle - was missing. If the woman attacked now,Avelyn would be sweptoffthewalkto fall to herdeath. She continued to move backward,hoping to back herself to a section where the wallwas stillintact on bothsides.</p><p>\"But the foolwent andgot himself killed on Crusade. Paenwould havebeen a finesubstitutefor Adam, but he was contractedand betrothed to you. But were you dead, wecould force the Gervillestohonor themarital contract with Diamanda,with Paen taking Adam'splace. \"</p><p>\"Butwhydo you even want to?\" Avelyn asked quickly, hoping to keep her talking until she reached a safer area. \"Surely with Diamanda'sbeauty you could findher anotherhusbandeasily enough. She - \"</p><p>\"Beauty is next to useless without wealth behind it,\" Lady Helen snapped, following her. \"Unfortunately, my brother is notnearly as successful a lord as our father before him. Though he had managed to keep it quiet, he had lost nearly everything butthecastle itself by the timehecontracted Diamanda's marriage. The betrothalshare he usedto secure Diamanda's marriageto Adam was supposedto havebeen mine. It was togo tomy betrothedon mymarriage, but he died young and mybrother neverbothered tonegotiate another marriage. He did not wishto spendthe money. Instead, I became a motherto Diamanda when her own mother died in birthingher. Ihadnohusband, but shebecame my child. \"</p><p>Helen took a deep breath. \"Iraised her asmy own. Tended herhurtsand fixed anyproblemset in her path. I will fix this too. She istoogood tobe the wifeof a minorbaron, or to have to lie with a wealthyold one who has one foot already in the ground. Iwill not see it. She deservesa husbandas strong, handsome and wealthy as Paen, and she will have him!\"</p> <p>On that note, Lady Helen lunged ather. Avelyn scooted backward, desperateto get to asafer section of wall, but Diamanda's aunt came after her like avalkyrie,her cape flyingout aroundher as she charged. She hit Avelynhard, sending her reeling backward,and for onemoment,Avelyn fearedshehadn'tbeen quick enough,that she would fallthrough where the parapet wasmissing. But then she felt her shoulders strike the walland shesentup a silent prayerof thanks. But, Of course, Lady Helen could notstop now. Avelyn knew too much.</p><p>An enraged screech pouring from herlips, the womangrabbedher andtriedto drag herawayfrom the wall, apparently intending to throwher off the walk. Caught upin the struggle, Avelyn almostdidn't notice thebrush ofsomething against her leg; then she glanced down. Much toher astonishment, Samson was wiggling between their moving feet, rubbingagainstfirst her, then Lady Helen.</p><p>Evenas Avelynfearedthat the baby pig wouldbe crushed,Lady Helen glanced down and saw thecreature. Avelynfoundherself suddenlyreleased. She sagged back againstthe wall in surprise as Lady Helendanced away withhorror. Samson immediately followed, snorting andsnuffling at her feet andsending the woman into apanic. Screaming infear now rather than anger, Diamanda's aunt continued to scuttle backward,desperatetoget away from the sweet creature.</p><p>Avelyn straightened and cried out as she sawLady Helen backing toward the missing section of wall, but the woman wastoo panickedto listen. Avelyn watched with shock andhorror as the woman set her foot back onelasttime, only to find emptyair. Avelyn saw the realization and horrorcross Lady Helen's faceas she fell backward, arms open as if reaching, mouth wide on a scream of horror as she dropped out of sight.</p><p>Her legs suddenly weak andtrembling, Avelynlether breath out ona slow sigh and sank to sit on thewalk. She would have been happy tostay therefor agood long while. Avelyn had no desire tb seetheresults ofLadyHelen'sfall. Nordid she have any eagerness to face Diamanda just then. In fact, she felt absolutely no urgencyabout leaving the walk at all.</p><p>Samson's snuffling ather knee throughher skirt madeAvelyn glance down. She picked up thesmall creaturewhohad saved her life and cuddled him againsther chest. \"You saved me, Samson. \"</p><p>\"Aye, he did. \"</p><p>Avelyn glanced up withastartto see Paen moving slowly along the walkway toward her. Pausing when hereachedher, he bent andtookher hand,helping herto herfeet. He engulfed her in a huge hug, then stepped back. Paen glanced from herto Samson, a soft smilecurvinghis lips as hereached outtopatthe small pig's back.</p><p>\"Good boy,\" he praised,and theyshareda smilebefore his expression became serious. \"I thought I had lost you. I could seeher backing you along the walkway as I ran across thebaileytothe stairs. By the time I washalfway up, shewas lunging at you and Ithought Iwould be toolate, that she wouldthrowyou offthewall before I could get here. I thought I had lost you. \"</p><p>\"She gave it agood try,\"Avelyn admitted. \"She was hoping thatifshedid,they could force youtofulfill the marriage contract with Diamanda inAdam's place. \"</p><p>\"What?\" Paen stared at her in amazement.</p><p>\"Aye. \" Avelyn nodded. \"It seemsDiamanda'sfamily has fallen onhard timesand Helen feared theywouldnot find her asuitable husband if theycouldnot force you toit. But to dothat, I had toberemoved. \"She patted his chest soothingly as anger built on his face. \"But she failed. Samsonsavedme. \"</p><p>\"Aye. \" Paen lethis breath out on a sigh. \"Andfor that he will live to a ripeold age and need neverfear ending up on the table. \" His voice was husky, and it was only now as the color began to return tohis facethat Avelyn realized how pale he'dbeen onfirst coming to her.</p><p>\"Areyouallright, my lord?\" sheasked with concern. \"You took a bad head wound. Mayhap you should not be up and running about. \"</p><p>Paen ignored the question and took Samson from her arms. He set the piglet gently on theground and ordered, \"Go inside. \"</p><p>Much to Avelyn's amazement, the piglet immediately scampered alongthewalkto the stairs. Avelyn turned tolean over thewall andwatchthe stairs as he hopped down them.</p><p>\"Idid not realize he could manage stairs yet,\" she saidwithsurprise.</p><p>\"How do youthink he gotuphere?\"Paen asked.</p><p>\"Oh. \" Her mouth wasan \"o\" of surprise, and her husband grinned.</p><p>\"You should not lookso surprised. You are the one who has been telling me how clever he is. \"</p><p>\"Aye. \" Avelynsmiled wryly and turned back to smileather husband. \"I am not accident prone and the fates have not been against me. \"</p><p>\"Nay,\" Paen agreed. \"I talked to Diamandaand Runilda, andfromwhat I can piecetogether, you have survived atleast three attempts on your life. \"</p><p>\"Four,\" Avelyncorrected. \"Two poisonings, thefall through the floor, and the boulder. \"</p><p>\"Two poisonings?\" he asked with dismay.</p><p>Avelyn nodded.</p><p>Heshookhis head. \"And thenthere isthis, her last attempt,\" he pointed outand saidsolemnly, \"Ratherthan be against you, the fates would most definitely seemto have been looking outfor you. You are very, verylucky. \"</p><p>\"Aye. \" She grinned.</p><p>\"And so amI. \"</p><p>\"You?\" Avelyn asked with surprise.</p><p>\"Aye. Iam luckybecause Ihave the perfect wife. \"</p><p>Avelyn shook her head. \"I amnot perfect. \"</p><p>\"You are perfect for me, Avelyn. Youare intelligent, beautifuland capable. You are the perfect wife for me. \"</p><p>He kissed her,then pulledback and said,\"IjustwishIcouldmake you see your value. \"</p><p>\"I believe, my lord, that I am beginning to do so. But perhaps it is something I hadtosee formyself,\" she saidgently, then explained, \"With each accomplishment I have felt better and better aboutmyself. \"</p><p>\"I am glad. \" Leaning forward, hepressed a kiss to her lips,then slid his arm around her shouldersand turnedher towalk to thestairs. \"Avelyn, inthe future I think we should talk more. \"</p><p>Avelyn blinked. \" Weshould?\"</p><p>\"Aye, Runilda told methatyou claimed someone had hit you with somethingand knocked you into the hole inthe floor. If you had told me that, I could have put this all together muchmore quickly. AndInotice you did not mention that you had seen Diamandaon the wall after the boulder felltoday. Infuture I wouldlikeyou to be more forthcoming. \"</p><p>\"Hmm. \" Avelyn didn't know what tosay,sincehe was correct. She had thought he wasn't as forthcoming with her ashe could be, but on the otherhand, nor had she been. And she wasn'tspeakingup rightnow. He had told her thathe considered himself lucky to have her as awife, but shehadn't reciprocated. Nor had she yet told himthatshe lovedhim.</p><p>Clearing her throat,she said, \"Husband?\"</p><p>\"Aye. \"</p><p>\"If weare to be more forthcoming, I think there issomething Ishould tell you. \"</p><p>\"Aye?\"</p><p>\"Iloveyou. \"</p><p>Paen stopped walking and turned to face her. \"What?\"</p><p>\"I love you,\" sheadmitted, liftingherchinbravely.</p><p>\"Not just with thedutiful love of a wife for her husband, but I love you... so much that itmakesmyheart acheat times just to think of you. \"</p><p>Paen stared at her. Forseveral minute she simply stood there, staring ather as if he thought he might never see her again; then hebent his head and kissed her in a way she had never experienced before. His kisses were usually hungry and passionate,but thisonewas gentle, achingly so.</p><p>When helifted hishead, Avelyn blinked her eyes open.</p><p>\"I love youtoo, wife,\"he announced solemnly, then tucked her against his side and continued walking. </p> </body></html>"]
