Leah Lundberg walked past the nativity scene Providence Hospital put out every year, stopped, and stared. The north wind cut through her like a boning knife as Leah studied the ramshackle stable, her heart heavy, her life more so.</p><p>The blue of Mary\u2019s gown had long since faded, she noted. Joseph, leaning heavily against his staff, was slightly off-balance, and looked as if he\u2019d topple in a stiff wind. There seemed to be one less lamb this year and one of the donkey\u2019s ears was missing. It was a small wonder the structure remained upright with the weight of the angel, yellow now instead of golden, nailed to the top. Triumphantly, she blew her chipped horn proclaiming the glorious news of the Savior\u2019s birth.</p><p>The hospital had reconstructed the Christmas scene every Advent for the last fifty years, long before Leah was born, long before she realized an entire lifetime of tears could be stored within a single tattered soul.</p> <p>It was ironic that a woman who toiled as a nurse day after day on a maternity ward would be childless herself. Her work with laboring mothers was her gift, they said, her special talent. Women specifically requested that she be with them for the birthing of their children.</p><p>For whatever reason, Leah had been granted the touch, a gentle hand, and a sympathetic heart. Birthing mothers claimed she was inspiring, encouraging, and supportive. Labor didn\u2019t seem nearly as difficult when Leah was with a patient. She\u2019d heard it all before, countless times, the praise, the gratitude. What most of Leah\u2019s patients didn\u2019t know was that she, who was an expert at labor and delivery, had never given birth herself.</p><p>Her patients left the hospital with their arms and their lives full. Each afternoon, Leah walked out of Providence alone. And empty.</p><p>Tears crowded her eyes and spilled unheeded down her cheeks. She bowed her head and closed her eyes in prayer. \u201cDear God,\u201d she whispered, choking down the emotion, \u201cplease give me a child.\u201d It was a plea she\u2019d whispered innumerable times over the last ten years. So often that she was convinced God had long since given up hearing. Or caring.</p><p>Wiping the moisture from her face, she gathered her coat more closely around her thin shoulders and headed for the staff parking lot. She forced herself to smile. It upset Andrew that she continued to dwell on their inability to have children, and she didn\u2019t want him to know she\u2019d been crying.</p> <p>Her husband had accepted the news with little more than a shrug. He felt bad, knowing how desperately she longed for a baby, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as earth-shattering to him. If God saw fit to send children into their lives, then fine, if not, that was fine too.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t all right with Leah and she doubted that it ever would be.</p><p>Leah\u2019s prayer whistled in the breeze, up through the bare spindly arms of a lanky birch tree, winging its way higher and higher until it had ascended the clouds and drifted into the warm winds of heaven. It arrived fresh with the salt of her tears at the desk of the Archangel Gabriel. The very angel who\u2019d announced the news of the virgin birth to Mary nearly two thousand years earlier. His responsibilities had been wide and varied through time, but he felt a certain tenderness for humans and their multiple problems. He found earth\u2019s population to be a curious lot. They were stubborn, rebellious, and arrogant. Their antics were a constant source of amusement to those behind the pearly gates. Who could help laughing at a group of people who heatedly declared that God was dead and clung to the belief that Elvis was alive?</p><p>\u201cLeah Lundberg,\u201d Gabriel repeated softly, frowning. The name was vaguely familiar. He flipped the pages of a cumbersome book until he\u2019d found what he was seeking. Sighing, he relaxed against the back of his chair and slowly shook his head. Leah was one of his most persistent cases. He\u2019d heard her prayer often, had ushered it himself to the very feet of God.</p><p>Gabriel had sent countless couriers to intercede on Leah\u2019s behalf, but their efforts had been met with repeated failure. Time after time, their reports came back virtually the same. It was a familiar problem that blocked the answer to Leah\u2019s prayer. Herself.</p><p>It would have been much easier if Gabriel could sit down with Leah and talk out this matter face to face. Circumstances arose now and again when doing exactly what was required, but generally not when it came to answering prayer. Humans tended to believe all that was required of them was a few mumbled words, then they were utterly content to leave the matter in the hands of God.</p> <p>Through the ages humans had yet to discover what should have been obvious. The answers to prayer required participation. The people of earth expected God to do it all. Only a shocking few realized they had their own role to perform.</p><p>A good example was a request that had come in earlier from Monica Fischer, a preacher\u2019s daughter. Monica had asked for a husband. Normally this wouldn\u2019t be a problem; she was twenty-five and strikingly attractive, or would be if she didn\u2019t choose to disguise her natural beauty. The whole process of attracting a young man was complicated by her self-righteous attitude. Few men, even devout servants of God, were willing to marry sanctimonious prudes.</p><p>Gabriel hadn\u2019t decided how he would handle Monica\u2019s request or the prayer that had come in the unusual form of a letter from Timmy Potter. Gabriel had a soft spot when it came to children\u2019s prayers. Timmy was nine, and had requested a father.</p><p>Gabriel shook his head, needing to clear his thoughts. He\u2019d deal with one prayer at a time. For the moment Leah\u2019s request was the most pressing, and the most challenging. He\u2019d figure out something for Monica and Timmy later.</p><p>He stood and walked around his desk. Gabriel thought best while on his feet. It didn\u2019t help matters that Leah chose Christmastime to issue her fervent prayer. The busiest time of year, no less. His best prayer ambassadors were already out on assignment and those who were left were young angels lacking in experience.</p><p>Of course there was always Mercy. She possessed a heart of pure gold and was especially patient with humans. But there was a small problem with this particular angel.</p><p>Mercy was enthralled with earthly things. Mechanical things. She seemed particularly fond of escalators and motor scooters and not even heaven knew what else. Reports of her escapades circulated in both spheres.</p><p>An angel, especially one under Gabriel\u2019s command, simply did not hijack meter maids\u2019 carts. That business with the forklift on the San Francisco waterfront . . . well, that didn\u2019t bear thinking about.</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s musings were interrupted by the whisper of rustling wings. Mercy appeared bright-eyed and hopeful before him, her hands clasped in prayerlike fashion. She was a dainty thing, petite in stature when compared to several of the other prayer ambassadors.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grinned. He hadn\u2019t sent for Mercy, but apparently God had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to volunteer my services in any way I can,\u201d Mercy offered brightly, her wings fluttering slightly with anticipation. \u201cI want to prove myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stay away from motor scooters?\u201d</p><p>Mercy nodded eagerly. \u201cAnd jet skis.\u201d</p><p>Jet skis. He hadn\u2019t heard about that one and it was best that he didn\u2019t, not now, at least. \u201cI can\u2019t have you intercepting any more Boeing 747s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned my lesson, Gabriel,\u201d she murmured, and smiled innocently, as if to suggest that these incidents were a series of minor misunderstandings. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t get into any of the trouble I have before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t,\u201d Gabriel muttered.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll give me the assignment?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood. His seven-foot stature was intimidating, he knew. Each time the heavenly Father had sent him on a mission to earth he\u2019d been required to calm a multitude of fears before relaying his message.</p><p>\u201cThe prayer is from Leah Lundberg,\u201d Gabriel explained with a thoughtful frown. \u201cFor the past ten years she\u2019s been in constant communication with heaven. She longs for a child.\u201d</p><p>Compassion filled Mercy\u2019s deep blue eyes. \u201cHer arms must feel empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Leah first married Andrew Lundberg the prayer request came now and again, but when she didn\u2019t become pregnant after repeated failure, well, let me put it like this. Leah had us in a tizzy for a good long while. At one point we had five angels assigned full-time to her prayers. A year later we reduced it to one, and now her prayers are infrequent, and her faith is weak.\u201d</p><p>Mercy blinked several times. \u201cThis is a problem case, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. Mercy had achieved some success in answering prayer, but her experience was limited. To assign her to Leah was an extreme measure. Gabriel regretted that, but he didn\u2019t have much choice.</p><p>\u201cHow often does she pray now?\u201d Mercy asked, and her wings stilled.</p><p>\u201cOnce or twice a year. She\u2019s given up believing God listens to the concerns of His children. Unfortunately she\u2019s given up on her faith too,\u201d Gabriel explained with regret. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t tragic enough, she\u2019s walking straight towards the pit of despair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not true about her prayers going unheard,\u201d Mercy cried. \u201cSomeone should tell her, give her a message, offer her hope. Why, all that poor, dear woman needs is a bit of reassurance.\u201d Agitated, the petite angel paced the area in front of Gabriel\u2019s desk. \u201cSend me, please, Gabriel, I promise to stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>The archangel hesitated. He had the sinking feeling that Mercy\u2019s promise would quickly become famous last words.</p><p>He noticed that the tips of her wings feathered out and fluttered gently when he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you and explain the circumstances. I can\u2019t afford to spare you much past Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust until Christmas,\u201d Mercy protested. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give me much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo whatever you feel is necessary to help her,\u201d he said, granting her unprecedented powers.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t want to say it, but when it came to Leah Lundberg, he felt her prayer had little likelihood of being answered. Over the last ten years the human had been given countless chances. Mercy was one of the least experienced angels in his task force. He didn\u2019t hold out much hope that she\u2019d succeed when so many other far more accomplished ambassadors had failed.</p><p>\u201cWe should start right away, then, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Mercy pressed, eager to begin.</p><p>Gabriel glanced at the stack of unanswered prayers piling up on his desk and nodded. \u201cI can only spare a few moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate whatever help you can give me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grumbled under his breath. This could be a waste of precious time, then again, it might well be the answer to a long-standing request. He\u2019d witnessed far greater miracles.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d the archangel instructed, and Mercy followed obediently behind him. He was fond of this prayer ambassador although he wasn\u2019t keen on admitting as much.</p><p>\u201cI hope I can help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so too,\u201d Gabriel murmured. \u201cLook with me and I\u2019ll introduce you to Leah and Andrew Lundberg.</p><p>Slowly he raised his massive arms and with one swift motion the thick white clouds parted into a gentle mist that slowly dissipated. The scene unfolded like the opening pages of a pop-up book as the majesty that surrounded Mercy evaporated into the midst of the mundane world. The archangel and Mercy stood on the sidelines as Leah Lundberg opened the front door of her house and walked inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d Leah called out to her husband, removing her thick winter coat and hanging it in the hall closet. As always her house was spotless. Her furniture was polished, the latest in contemporary styling. The black-lacquer-on-silver dining table shone back at her like a mirror. Her gaze rested on a white lambskin sofa that had cost nearly four thousand dollars. Her home was expensive and ultramodern. A child would wreak havoc in her pristine domain.</p><p>Leah\u2019s friends envied her home. Their own were often a minefield of toys and other traps children left scattered about. Her friends\u2019 lives centered around feeding schedules, soccer practices, and flute lessons. Leah would gladly relinquish her grand piano for a crib and the Persian rug for a playpen. She would gladly trade her tidy existence for the chaos and joy a child would bring into her life and marriage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got dinner cooking,\u201d her husband announced from inside the kitchen. \u201cHow does marinated flank steak, new red potatoes, and fresh asparagus sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d She moved into the kitchen and wrapped her arms around Andrew\u2019s waist.</p> <p>Their massive kitchen included every modern convenience imaginable. A large room for two people who dined out more often than they ate at home. Andrew, an architect, had designed her kitchen when they believed their future included children. She\u2019d clung to the thread of that hope, but it had grown impossibly thin as the fiber of her dreams had worn away.</p><p>Leah\u2019s eyes rested on her shiny, clean cupboards and her waxed, spotless floor. Her heart moved into her throat with a sharp stab of unexpected pain. She longed for a refrigerator door smudged with jelly-coated fingerprints, and linoleum scuffed with marks made from walking shoes and toy trucks.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a long day?\u201d Andrew asked.</p><p>Leah nodded. She deeply loved her husband. Without him, she didn\u2019t know how she would have endured the last several years. \u201cWe delivered three babies before noon. Two boys and a girl.\u201d Leah had long since lost count of the number of births she\u2019d assisted. Hundreds, she guessed. But it didn\u2019t matter how often or how commonplace it seemed, the miracle of birth hadn\u2019t lost its impact.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cSame old grind as always,\u201d Andrew mumbled, preoccupied with their dinner preparations.</p><p>\u201cWe should have ordered out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d he told her, and she could hear the warmth in his voice. \u201cI talked to the decorator about a tree,\u201d he said, and turned to face Leah. He buried his face in her hair and breathed in deeply. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have the tree done in angels this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngels,\u201d Leah repeated softly. \u201cThat sounds nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom phoned earlier,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe invited us over for Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>Leah nodded. Christmas was meant for children. Instead of stringing popcorn and cranberries on the tree with her toddlers, she was working with a decorator who would shape their Christmas tree into a work of art. She would have much preferred a work of love.</p> <p>When, Leah asked herself, when, oh, when, would the raw edges of her pain go away? She\u2019d be a good mother. Andrew would be a doting, loving father. That God in his almighty wisdom had not seen fit to give her a child was the cruelest of fates. Tears filled her eyes and she looked away, not wanting Andrew to see. He knew her so well it was difficult to hide anything from him.</p><p>\u201cLeah?\u201d</p><p>She snuggled closer in his arms, needing the warm security of his love.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse at Christmastime, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>They\u2019d had this same conversation a hundred times over the years. With nothing new to add, with nothing new to share, it was best shelved.</p><p>\u201cWhen will dinner be ready?\u201d she asked, easing herself from the comfort of Andrew\u2019s embrace. She managed a watery smile. \u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen enough?\u201d Gabriel asked, standing directly behind Mercy.</p><p>She\u2019d seen more than she wanted. Slowly, thoughtfully, Mercy dragged her gaze away from the scene below. Compassion swelled and throbbed within her. \u201cLeah\u2019s hurting so terribly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t stopped and won\u2019t until . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil when?\u201d Mercy prompted.</p><p>\u201cUntil she\u2019s found her peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace,\u201d Mercy cried, folding back her wings. \u201cThe poor dear\u2019s at war with herself.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked surprised by her insight. \u201cLeah must fully accept her inability to bear a child before the invisible threads that bind her fall away,\u201d Gabriel explained. \u201cThen and only then will she be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my mission, to show Leah the way to peace?\u201d The tentacles of dread gripped Mercy\u2019s tender heart. Gabriel was seeking the impossible. She longed to help this woman of the earth, longed to ease the pain of her loneliness and the desolation of her soul. Slowly Mercy shook her head, wondering how she, an inexperienced prayer ambassador, would break through the barrier of Leah\u2019s misery and lead her to the warm, sandy shores of serenity.</p><p>\u201cYou may choose to refuse,\u201d Gabriel announced formally.</p><p>\u201cI would never do that,\u201d Mercy said, surprising herself with the strength of her fervor. She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d manage but somehow, some way, she\u2019d find a means of accomplishing her mission. One thing she\u2019d learned since her appointment as a prayer ambassador. With God\u2019s help she could forge a path where there hadn\u2019t been one before. With God\u2019s help she would make a way where there was none.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t spare you any longer than three weeks, earth time,\u201d Gabriel reminded her. \u201cNot with the New Year coming on. You know what it\u2019s like around here when people start making resolutions. By the middle of January, earthlings decide to take one last-ditch effort and try prayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly three weeks,\u201d Mercy repeated slowly. Even now she was having a difficult time pulling her gaze away from the scene between Leah and her husband.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll contact me with any problems?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>Mercy bristled. The archangel\u2019s offer insinuated that she\u2019d encounter more than her share, which was an unfair assumption. It was true she\u2019d had trouble with the last assignment, had gotten sidetracked a time or two, but she successfully managed to complete her mission.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no physical reason why Leah can\u2019t become pregnant?\u201d Mercy asked, wanting to be certain she had her facts straight. The last thing she wanted was to walk into the middle of a prayer request without adequate information.</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever,\u201d Gabriel stated matter of factly. \u201cLeah and Andrew have been to see every fertility specialist on the West Coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about adoption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey applied five years ago, but the waiting list is several years long. They were chosen by a birth mother and then bitterly disappointed when she changed her mind at the last minute. They withdrew their name shortly afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very sad,\u201d Mercy said softly.</p><p>\u201cThe Lundbergs are deeply in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat helps.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s chuckle caught Mercy off guard. She swiveled her attention to the archangel, who was clearly amused.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Mercy demanded, irritated and not taking time to censure the thought. Gabriel, after all, was an archangel and she was in no position to be questioning him.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, smiling broadly.</p><p>Gabriel wasn\u2019t one to smile. He did so only rarely. Mercy wasn\u2019t convinced it was even in his personality profile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give this prayer request my best effort,\u201d Mercy said, thinking it was important that Gabriel know that.</p><p>\u201cI trust you will. Just promise me one thing.\u201d</p><p>Here it came, the long list of offenses she\u2019d managed to rack up in the short while she\u2019d been serving as a prayer ambassador. \u201cYes?\u201d she said, straightening for the coming lecture.</p><p>\u201cStay away from scooters and escalators this time.\u201d</p><p>Mercy grinned. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>It was a disgrace, a downright disgrace the way Providence Hospital continued to use the same weatherworn figures in their nativity scene, Monica Fischer mused. The colors had faded and the animals, why, it was a travesty how dilapidated they\u2019d become. If the hospital insisted upon decorating the grounds for Christmas, then they should do so properly.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the nativity scene at Providence Hospital?\u201d she asked her father as she joined him and the other choir members outside Nordstrom department store, downtown Seattle.</p><p>\u201cI adore the cr\u00e8che,\u201d Lloyd Fischer said with a beaming smile. \u201cMary\u2019s seen better years, I know, but I can\u2019t help thinking that battered stable must be much closer to the way it actually was that night in Bethlehem than we realize.\u201d</p><p>Her father was right, Monica knew. He generally was. She tried to be as charitable in thought and deed as he was, but it seemed beyond her. That was the crux of her problem, Monica realized. Every man she met was measured against her father\u2019s goodness and none had withstood the evaluation. Not even Patrick, whom she\u2019d dated off and on for the last two years. Apparently their relationship was more off than she realized. He\u2019d phoned two weeks earlier to tell her he was engaged to someone else.</p><p>That hurt and it hurt deeply. Monica had been dating Patrick all this time and assumed they\u2019d enjoyed one another\u2019s company. She hadn\u2019t a clue he was seeing anyone else. True, they hadn\u2019t spoken of love or commitment, but they\u2019d shared something special, at least Monica had thought it was special.</p><p>To make matters worse Patrick had finished by saying he would always think of Monica as a special friend. Monica had wanted much more than his friendship. It was time for her to marry and start her own family, and she\u2019d foolishly set her sights on the wrong man. Now she\u2019d need to make up for lost time, but by heaven, she vowed she\u2019d marry and soon. There was a man for her, she was convinced of that, and she fully intended to find him.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d her father asked, cupping her elbow.</p><p>Monica nodded. She enjoyed these Christmas performances the church choir gave each December in the busy downtown streets. The harried shoppers would pause and listen to the joyous music, enjoying the short respite from the hectic holiday rush. For a few short moments peace would descend like a warm blanket upon the milling crowd.</p><p>Monica climbed to the soprano section on the back row of the risers. She was tall, nearly five-nine, and stood a full head above the majority of the sopranos. Unlike the others, she opted for sensible flats with her dark blue suit. Her hair, although shoulder length, was tucked into a tight bun at the base of her neck. She wore no cosmetics and frowned upon women who did.</p><p>This was the first year their music was provided by their own church band. To Monica\u2019s way of thinking they should have made a point of practicing more often. The band\u2019s mistakes stuck out in an otherwise flawless program.</p><p>She played the piano, and as a favor to the choir director, Michael Simpson, sat in for a couple of weeks in their practice sessions. She hoped her dedication and example would inspire the small group. Her plan hadn\u2019t worked and no one seemed to appreciate the rigorous practice schedule she set for herself and the others. Eventually she\u2019d gone back to the choir, and was pleased she had. Michael, as a means of making amends, asked that she sing a short solo in one of her all-time favorite Christmas carols, \u201cSilent Night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When everyone was positioned on the risers, Michael raised his baton. The choir snapped to attention. Monica was proud of the professionalism of their small ensemble. Their voices rose in melodic harmony, blending smoothly. Monica\u2019s clear, high soprano voice escalated gloriously with the others. When she sang, she felt closer to heaven than at any other time, even when she prayed, which was something she\u2019d been doing a good deal of lately. She needed a husband.</p><p>\u201cMonica\u2019s the tall one on the top riser,\u201d Gabriel said, pointing out the earthling to Goodness. Like Mercy, Gabriel held a special fondness for this prayer ambassador, who, again like Mercy, possessed certain character traits that left him with misgivings. If it weren\u2019t for the business of the Christmas season, he wouldn\u2019t have assigned Goodness such a difficult case.</p><p>Unfortunately he had little choice and of those ambassadors left, Goodness was his best chance of seeing this prayer to fruition. If only he could guarantee that Goodness would stay away from television and movie screens. The incident of her showing up on an in-flight movie and using John Wayne\u2019s voice to warn everyone of approaching turbulence continued to rankle. He\u2019d counseled her on a number of occasions, but to no avail.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Goodness said, looking up at him with eyes filled with innocent promise. \u201cI won\u2019t pull any more stunts with humans. I\u2019ve learned my lesson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure this time?\u201d</p><p>Goodness glanced toward Monica and nodded eagerly.</p><p>Gabriel wished he shared her confidence. His own gaze drifted toward Monica Fischer. Her name was a familiar one as her father, a man after God\u2019s own heart, often included her in his prayers. Monica came from a strong religious background. With her father serving as the pastor, Monica had been raised in the church. It was ironic that what the young woman lacked was faith when she was surrounded on all sides by it. Instead Monica was deeply religious and had yet to distinguish the differences between faith and religion.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lovely,\u201d Goodness claimed, locking her wings together. \u201cFinding Monica a husband won\u2019t be the least bit difficult, not when she\u2019s so outwardly beautiful. God must have a special man in mind for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Gabriel agreed with some reluctance, wondering just how much he should explain to this inexperienced ambassador. Goodness would learn everything she needed to know soon enough, he decided. The information he had would overwhelm her now. Soon enough Goodness would recognize exactly what God had planned for Monica Fischer.</p> <p>The angel focused her attention on him, her eyes wide and questioning, awaiting an explanation. \u201cWhat is it I must teach her?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel drew in a deep breath and explained. \u201cI fear Monica\u2019s steeped in the juices of her own self-righteousness. She struggles to be good under her own power and ignores all the help made available to her through faith.\u201d</p><p>Goodness sighed with heartfelt sympathy. \u201cShe must be miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gabriel returned without hesitation, \u201cshe just makes everyone else feel that way. Monica\u2019s complicated her life with a long list of rights and wrongs and dos and don\u2019ts. Her head\u2019s so clouded with matters unrelated to faith that she\u2019s lost sight of what it means to be a child of God. Her struggles are useless when everything has already been done for her. All she need do is ask.\u201d But Gabriel wasn\u2019t telling Goodness anything new. The earth was populated with those who looked for redemption through religion.</p><p>\u201cThe poor dear.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t view Monica in those terms. It was her type that caused him the greatest concern. While Monica struggled to lead people to God, her sanctimonious ways often steered them in the opposite direction.</p> <p>\u201cShe sings very well,\u201d Goodness commented.</p><p>Gabriel nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s gifted in several areas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have any trouble teaching what she needs to know before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>How confident Goodness sounded, Gabriel noticed. He sighed inwardly, wondering once more how much he should explain, then decided it would be best not to discourage Goodness\u2019s enthusiasm. She\u2019d discover everything she needed to know soon enough.</p><p>\u201cThe man God has for her is ready for a wife?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel was beginning to feel a twinge of guilt. \u201cYes, and eager. Very eager. Only he doesn\u2019t know it yet, but you won\u2019t have to worry about him. Monica\u2019s the one who needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do everything within my power to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready?\u201d Gabriel asked, thinking he\u2019d best send her soon before he said too much. This request would be a learning experience for this young prayer ambassador as well as for her charge. All he could do was hope for the best.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Goodness said, impatient to leave the splendor of heaven and walk incognito into a dull, sin-cloaked world.</p><p>Gabriel watched as Goodness floated down from heaven, thinking humans were right about one thing. God often did work in mysterious ways and never more so than in this instance. Gabriel was confident of one thing. Neither Goodness nor Monica Fischer would ever be the same again.</p><p>Monica looked out over the gathering crowd and was pleased at the attention their small choir had garnered. Shoppers stopped, their arms folded around packages and some of the tiredness left their eyes. A few joined in and sang themselves. Children were lifted in their fathers\u2019 arms for a better look. The transformation the singing group produced brought a small, satisfied smile in Monica\u2019s heart.</p><p>Then she noticed a man who stood head and shoulders above the others. He seemed to be trapped by the people around him, and was impatiently edging his way around the gathering.</p><p>Being on the top riser gave her an excellent view and she frowned at this intruder. He needed both a shave and a haircut. Even from this distance she noted his eyes, which were a cutting shade of cobalt blue. He seemed to need to get somewhere and was impatiently making his way through the crowd, scooting around one and then another with nary a word of pardon. He wore a beige trench coat and looked as if he\u2019d slept in the bedraggled thing.</p><p>Monica\u2019s gaze followed him as long as she could, but he soon moved out of her peripheral vision. What an unpleasant man, she decided, annoyed at his intrusion into their performance. No doubt he was a modern-day Scrooge who resented every moment wasted on the celebration of the Savior\u2019s birth.</p><p>The small church band struck up the first chords of the next carol, \u201cSilent Night.\u201d The highest notes were well within Monica\u2019s vocal range and her voice was strong enough to ring out loud and clear. When the moment arrived for her short solo performance she allowed her soul to soak up the music and fly free. Then unexpectedly, from out of nowhere, another voice joined and blended with hers.</p><p>Quickly Monica looked in both directions to see who had been so bold as to disrupt her one moment of glory. She knew she shouldn\u2019t be so concerned, but it bothered her, and yet as far as she could tell none of the other sopranos were singing.</p><p>She raised her voice a full octave, straining her vocal cords. The second voice followed her lead, angelic in its purity and so strong it all but drowned out her own. What perplexed Monica most was that no one else around her seemed to notice anything was amiss. Faces from the audience gazed on approvingly and even the choir director smiled, delighted by her performance.</p><p>As she drew to a close, the last of the notes fading into nothingness, the small crowd cheered and she was enthusiastically applauded. Annoyed that her one and only solo had been interrupted by an intruder, Monica twisted around to see if she could find the second voice.</p><p>She must have been more energetic in her efforts than she realized because she lost her balance. Her arms flew out in an effort to catch herself, but before she could alert anyone to her plight, she tumbled backward off the top step of the riser.</p><p>Crying out, her arms flapping in empty space, she was surprised to land in the unexpected cushion of a man\u2019s waiting arms.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, what do we have here?\u201d</p><p>It was him. The very man she\u2019d noticed earlier, the one who\u2019d cut his way through the crowd with such impatience.</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d For the life of her Monica couldn\u2019t make herself speak. All she could do was stare into his handsome features. On closer inspection his eyes were a deeper shade, a metallic blue, amused now, but dispassionate. The thick lines that fanned out from his eyes weren\u2019t from smiling. They spoke of experience, most of it harsh, and disenchantment, most of it warranted, she guessed. Lines bracketed his mouth as well, they deepened as he studied her with the same curiosity with which she regarded him.</p><p>\u201cNo need to take such a chance,\u201d he chided. \u201cIf you wanted an introduction all you needed to do was ask.\u201d</p><p>Gasping and breathless, Monica struggled until he slowly, reluctantly lowered her feet to the ground. He waited until she\u2019d found her balance before he released her completely.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to thank me,\u201d he suggested lazily.</p><p>Flustered, Monica blinked several times, seldom at a loss for words as she was now. \u201cThank you,\u201d she managed, the words as stiff as starch, stuck in her dry throat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what happened, but apparently I lost my balance.\u201d</p><p>His brazen grin broadened. \u201cWas that you singing just now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and the curiosity got the better of her. \u201cDid you hear two voices or one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there were two. That\u2019s what flustered me so. Another voice blended with mine. A strong soprano. Surely you heard the other voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, lady, all I heard was you and I\u2019m not much for religious music, but from where I was standing you sounded real good.\u201d</p><p>She blushed with pleasure. Her voice was adequate and she did love to sing, but she didn\u2019t possess any great talent. To assume she did would have been vain on her part, and vanity was a greased track straight to the arms of the devil as far as Monica was concerned. \u201cThank you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need some help joining the others?\u201d</p><p>Monica glanced toward the riser and shook her head. The ensemble was almost finished with their program and it would only disrupt the group to have her climb back into position now.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be on my way,\u201d he said. \u201cI can hardly wait to tell Lou. It isn\u2019t often a beautiful woman throws herself into my arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t throw myself into your arms,\u201d she informed him primly, straightening the sleeves of her dark suit jacket.</p><p>\u201cNot technically perhaps, but there you were, pretty as a picture gazing up at me, asking for a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Monica bristled. \u201cI most certainly was not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt felt good to be in my arms too, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Monica stared at him in numb disbelief. Was the man so arrogant he actually assumed she\u2019d hurl herself into open space on the off chance a man would catch her? He was being ridiculous and she took delight in telling him as much.</p><p>He was smiling when she finished, a cocky off-center smile that lifted the edges at one side of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019d say, from the look of you, having a man hold and kiss you is exactly what you need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This sounded like a threat to Monica, and she pinched her lips together and retreated a step. \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting!\u201d</p><p>He raised his hands, palms up. \u201cI\u2019m just an innocent bystander. I was minding my own business, looking for nothing better than to drown my sorrows in a cold beer when you catapulted into my arms. The way I look at it, you should be thanking your lucky stars I was here to catch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were headed toward the Blue Goose?\u201d she asked, realizing now why he\u2019d been so determined to cut through the crowd. He wanted a drink.</p><p>\u201cLady, after the day I\u2019ve had, you\u2019d need a beer too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she pleaded, urgently taking a step toward him.</p><p>He glared at her, and his beige trench coat fanned out at his sides. The cold cut through Monica, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother him. \u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d he demanded impatiently.</p><p>\u201cDrink. There are better ways of dealing with problems other than alcohol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Monica. Monica Fischer,\u201d she said, holding out her hand to him. He looked at it for a moment as if he were going to ignore it before reluctantly exchanging handshakes.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I ever met you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cPlease, let my friends and me help you,\u201d she said, gesturing toward the ensemble standing on the risers, singing the last of the songs.</p><p>\u201cListen, all I want is a cold beer and some peace and quiet. I\u2019ve been on a stakeout for the past twenty hours and I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with the police?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, and it was evident by the way he glanced longingly toward the Blue Goose that he had other matters on his mind. \u201cI\u2019m a private detective,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThere, does that satisfy you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must be tired,\u201d she tried again, thinking fast, hoping to convince him of the error of his ways.</p><p>\u201cAnd getting more so every minute. Good-bye, Marcia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica,\u201d she corrected. She hurried after him, convinced she owed him this much for having saved her from certain injury.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he said, without looking her way. \u201cHave a good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever talked to you about the direction your life is headed?\u201d she asked, scurrying to keep pace with him. She was tall, but he was taller and it took two of her strides to equal one of his.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to preach at me next? Trust me, the last thing I need now is a sermon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you promise me you won\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said, stopping abruptly, \u201cI\u2019m trying to be as polite as I can, but my patience for this malarkey is long gone. I\u2019m a responsible adult and I don\u2019t have a problem with alcohol, so if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d prefer to be left alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re drinking beer, aren\u2019t you, and it\u2019s barely afternoon,\u201d Monica insisted. \u201cAnyone who needs alcohol this early in the day must be addicted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then, to satisfy you, I\u2019ll order coffee. There, are you happy?\u201d</p><p>Monica knew a lie when she heard one. \u201cDon\u2019t try to appease me with lies,\u201d she said, glaring at him.</p><p>They\u2019d crossed the street by this time and he continued to ignore her as much as possible, but Monica was making that difficult. She didn\u2019t know what was driving her to behave so uncharacteristically. Normally she wasn\u2019t nearly as aggressive; she was weak on evangelism, but this man desperately needed help and she was returning a favor. He\u2019d saved her and now it was her turn to do him a good deed and rescue him, although it was clear he didn\u2019t appreciate or welcome her efforts.</p><p>They\u2019d reached the Blue Goose and Monica hurled herself against the thick wood door, flinging out her arms until she stood spread-eagled across the entrance.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he demanded, glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving you from yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo save someone else, would you?\u201d His eyes were formidable, cold and cutting, but Monica refused to back away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing this for your own good.\u201d</p><p>He clamped his mouth closed and appeared to be counting to ten. His head nodded with each number and by the time he reached eight, his patience had evaporated. \u201cEither you move or I\u2019ll be forced to move you myself and I guarantee you won\u2019t approve of my methods.\u201d</p><p>Monica was saved from having to make a decision when the door opened and she was momentarily pushed to one side. By the time she\u2019d turned around and recovered, her reluctant hero had disappeared. It didn\u2019t take her two seconds to know where he\u2019d gone. For half a heartbeat she toyed with the notion of going inside the Blue Goose after him.</p><p>Defeated and mildly discouraged, Monica trudged her way across the street. The other choir members were mingling with the crowd, passing out invitations for the Christmas Eve service. The idea had been her father\u2019s and although Monica feared they might attract riffraff from the streets, she hadn\u2019t said as much. It wouldn\u2019t do any good to argue with her father, not when he had such a soft spot in his heart for street people.</p><p>\u201cMonica.\u201d Michael Simpson, the director, edged his way around two altos and moved toward her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost my balance and fell off the riser,\u201d she explained.</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cA . . . someone caught me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t hurt.\u201d His smile was shy as he gently patted her hand. \u201cI wanted to congratulate you on your solo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour voice was never more pure.\u201d</p><p>Monica gestured weakly. To accept the credit would have been wrong. \u201cBut another voice joined mine. Didn\u2019t you hear it? I swear it came out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother voice?\u201d Michael asked, frowning. \u201cI only heard you, and you were magnificent. You really outdid yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica, Monica.\u201d The Reverend Fischer hurried to his daughter\u2019s side and clasped her hand between his. His eyes shone bright with tears. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard you sing more beautifully. You sounded so much like your mother. I\u2019d almost forgotten what a stunning voice she had. This is God\u2019s gift to you, this voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Dad . . .\u201d She stopped, not knowing how to explain. There had been another voice that merged with hers. One that didn\u2019t happen to belong to anyone in the choir. It didn\u2019t belong to anyone she knew.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, Goodness, Goodness,\u201d Mercy said in that small chiding tone Gabriel had used with her so often in the past. \u201cYou were the one singing, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Goodness did not attempt to deny it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. \u2018Silent Night\u2019 is one of my personal favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she heard you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d That part had been unintentional. Simply put, Goodness had gotten carried away with herself. But she had used considerable restraint. No one, however, seemed to appreciate that part. She could have used Barbra Streisand\u2019s voice. Barbra could really belt out \u201cSilent Night,\u201d or Judy Garland. Now, that would have caused a whole lot of comment. To her credit, Goodness had resisted, although on second thought, she did an excellent Carol Burnett.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Gabriel hears about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d The archangel would eventually find out, Goodness knew. There would be no keeping it from him, but even that hadn\u2019t been enough for her to resist singing with Monica.</p><p>\u201cHe might take you off the assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. Gabriel\u2019s shorthanded as it is. If he was going to pull me off this prayer request it would be for something a whole lot more troublesome than singing.\u201d The prayer ambassador was far more concerned by the consequences of her folly. Monica had fallen into the arms of that hard-nosed, disgruntled private investigator. If anything unsavory had happened, Goodness would have held herself personally responsible.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cTimmy,\u201d Jody Potter called from the compact kitchen. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d The nine-year-old kept his gaze level with the television as he worked the controls of the video game. \u201cI\u2019m just about to save the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimmy, please, we go through this every night.\u201d Jody\u2019s nerves were on edge and had been ever since she\u2019d found the letter. The folded sheet of paper had slipped from Timmy\u2019s school binder when she\u2019d set it on the kitchen counter the night before.</p><p>A letter to God, but this wasn\u2019t any ordinary letter. Timmy had asked for a father. Jody\u2019s first instinct had been to sit him down and explain that he already had a father. Only Timmy had no recollection of Jeff, who\u2019d died when Timmy was barely ten months old.</p><p>Timmy had no way of knowing how proud Jeff had been of his son. How he\u2019d insisted on holding him each night when he returned from the office and feeding him his last bottle. Timmy didn\u2019t remember that it was his father who\u2019d sung him to sleep and then stood by his crib, gently patting his back. Her son couldn\u2019t possibly remember that Jeff had burst into tears of joy the night Timmy had been born.</p><p>What Timmy wanted now was a father who was alive. Someone who could throw a ball and catch better than she could, according to his letter. Someone who understood and enjoyed football. Someone who would be a friend.</p><p>What Timmy accepted far better than she did herself, Jody realized, was that Jeff was forever lost to them. Her son was looking for a replacement.</p><p>\u201cI won,\u201d Timmy cried, leaping to his feet, holding his hands high above his head while he danced around the living room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved to know the world is safe at last,\u201d Jody muttered, carrying the meat loaf over to the round oak table. \u201cCan we eat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d From habit, Timmy hurried into the bathroom and washed his hands, drying them against his thighs as he joined his mother moments later.</p><p>They sat down at the table together and Jody passed the vegetables.</p><p>Timmy stared down at the bowl and frowned. \u201cI hate green beans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake three.\u201d Jody didn\u2019t know why she chose three, but it seemed a reasonable number and she was hoping to have a heart-to-heart talk with her son. A confrontation over green beans would be detrimental to her plan.</p><p>Timmy judiciously sorted through the vegetables until he\u2019d located three stubby green beans. Then he carefully placed them on the edge of his plate where they were in danger of slipping unnoticed onto the tablecloth. He paused and glanced up at Jody, who pretended not to notice.</p><p>She waited until he\u2019d drowned his slice of meat loaf in catsup and loaded his plate with fruit salad and mashed potatoes before she broached the subject of his letter.</p><p>\u201cWe were supposed to write someone for Christmas,\u201d Timmy explained after she mentioned having found it. \u201cI\u2019m too old for this Santa Claus stuff so I went straight to the source. It was silly anyway, the post office won\u2019t mail a letter to God. The teacher made a fuss about it and now you are too.

It had been a crushing emotional blow she hadn\u2019t expected. Her father\u2019s heart attack had taken the family by surprise. Just a week earlier, he\u2019d been in for his yearly physical and was given a clean bill of health. Both Jody and her mother had been rocked by shock and grief. She\u2019d assumed because her father had lived a long, full life that death would be easier to accept. That hadn\u2019t been the case any more than it had been with Jeff, whose death had come without warning.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, Mom,\u201d Timmy continued, burying a green bean deep in his pile of mashed potatoes, \u201cbut you can\u2019t throw a ball worth a darn and I need to practice. Mr. Dillard said I had a chance of being a really good player someday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not ugly either. I bet there\u2019s some man out there who\u2019d be willing to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Jody had to stop and think about that one. Her son wasn\u2019t intentionally insulting her. In his eyes, he\u2019d paid her a high compliment. \u201cI\u2019m sure there is someone who\u2019d be willing to take a chance and marry me,\u201d she said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d How eager he sounded. He scooted to the edge of his seat, propped his elbows against the table, and looked solidly at her. \u201cCould you find and marry him before Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimmy, be serious, Christmas is less than a month away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean it\u2019ll take longer than that to get me a dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure it will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d</p><p>Jody shrugged, not knowing how to answer. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to be married again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Timmy asked, his eyes wide and innocent. \u201cRick Trenton told me his mom\u2019s been married three times. You\u2019ve only been married once. I was thinking about that and it doesn\u2019t seem right. You\u2019re a lot prettier than Rick\u2019s mom and she\u2019s already had two more husbands than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to do with how pretty a woman is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what does it have to do with?\u201d He cocked his head to one side, awaiting her answer.</p><p>Jody wished she knew. \u201cMarriage is a complicated business.\u201d Much more complex than she could adequately explain to a nine-year-old boy who seemed to think she could find a husband on a grocery store shelf. She was about to suggest signing him up for Big Brothers when Timmy buried his fork in his meat and added, \u201cBesides, I was thinking about you having a baby. I\u2019ve decided I wouldn\u2019t mind if I had to share my bedroom. Rick\u2019s mom just had another baby and she let me hold him, and you know what, I kinda liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does Rick feel about having a little brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks it\u2019s cool, especially since he\u2019s got two little sisters. Rick said you don\u2019t get a choice if it\u2019s a boy or a girl when babies are born. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll feel about a sister instead of a brother, but I decided I\u2019d do what Rick does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake what he gets.\u201d</p><p>Jody set her fork aside, her appetite gone. \u201cThat\u2019s a mature attitude,\u201d she murmured, wondering what she was going to do next. Timmy was serious. He wanted a father. Now he was talking about a brother or sister too.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll start looking for a new dad for me?\u201d His big brown eyes studied her carefully as if her decision was a momentous one.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Jody said thoughtfully. \u201cNow eat your green beans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re buried in your mashed potatoes,\u201d she said, waving her fork at him. \u201cNow eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Mom.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until after nine that night, when Timmy was sound asleep in his bed, that Jody walked over to the bookcase and took out the bulky photo album. She sat in the overstuffed chair that had been Jeff\u2019s favorite and held the book against her breast in the dim light.</p><p>For several moments she closed her eyes. It had been almost a year since she\u2019d last looked at the pictures. Twelve long months since she\u2019d tortured herself with the memories. Timmy was right. It was way past the time for her to pick up the pieces of her life instead of dwelling in the past. A sob swelled in her throat as she tried to figure out how she was ever going to give up loving Jeff.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Timmy\u2019s mother,\u201d Gabriel said in quiet, somber tones.</p><p>Shirley looked down upon the young mother and her heart ached. \u201cShe seems to be crying. What\u2019s happened to make her so sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s thinking about Jeff, her husband who died,\u201d the archangel explained.</p><p>\u201cWhy does she torture herself this way?\u201d It made no sense to Shirley that this young woman would continue to torment herself with memories.</p><p>\u201cJody is the problem,\u201d Gabriel continued. \u201cShe continues to hold onto her husband. Before you can answer Timmy\u2019s prayer you\u2019ve got to deal with Jody. She must learn to trust enough to willingly let go of the past and reach toward the future. If she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019ll never be ready for the man God has for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s been over eight years, doesn\u2019t she realize what she\u2019s doing to herself and to her son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, all she knows is the pain. Your assignment is to gently guide her toward the joy that awaits her and Timmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you expect me to accomplish this before Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t look any more pleased about this time restraint than Shirley. \u201cI can\u2019t spare you any longer.\u201d</p><p>Shirley\u2019s wings stretched to their full reach, then folded over themselves once more. She\u2019d assumed this would be a cushy assignment. After all, she\u2019d only been serving as a prayer ambassador for a short while. The other cases she\u2019d been given had been far less complicated.</p><p>\u201cI . . . might not be able to help her,\u201d Shirley murmured.</p><p>\u201cApparently God the Father feels otherwise, or He wouldn\u2019t have personally requested you for Timmy\u2019s prayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can I reach Jody when others have failed? How can I show her she doesn\u2019t have to stop loving Jeff, only open up her heart and her life to the love God has ready and waiting for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll think of something, only . . .\u201d Gabriel hesitated and leveled his strict gaze on her. \u201cYou\u2019re not to pull the tricks you have in the past, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Shirley agreed. \u201cI won\u2019t misplace a single thing,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Goodness and Mercy told me earlier. I don\u2019t know what it is about you three, but you worry me more than all the other prayer ambassadors combined.\u201d He wiped his hand across his face, and briefly closed his eyes. \u201cJust do your level best to stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Chet Costello sat down at the bar in the Blue Goose and ordered a cold draft beer. He glanced over his shoulder to be sure that pesky little missionary hadn\u2019t decided to follow him inside. Seldom had he met a more aggravating woman.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s plaguing you?\u201d Lou asked from the other side of the bar. He polished the mahogany surface with a clean rag, his hand making wide circular movements as he studied Chet. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve lost your best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would too if you\u2019d sat up all night in the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were on a case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chet returned sarcastically, \u201cI enjoy spending my nights in a freezing car peeking at a couple through binoculars. These infidelity cases have always thrilled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to bite my head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t ask stupid questions.\u201d His little run-in with the do-gooder hadn\u2019t done anything to improve his mood. He\u2019d encountered a hundred pious souls just like her over the years, each one convinced he needed to be saved from himself. He\u2019d had it with that religious garbage years ago, and hadn\u2019t darkened the door of a church since his mother had died ten years earlier. He had no intention of changing his ways now.</p><p>He laughed out loud, the sound echoing like a sonic boom around the almost empty bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Lou asked, eager to share in the humor.</p><p>Chet paused, the beer bottle poised in front of his mouth. \u201cShe said there were better ways of settling problems than booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Lou asked, bracing both hands against the edge of the bar and grinning, waiting for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Chet wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk. She\u2019d gotten under his skin, he realized, somewhat surprised. What was her name again? Marcia, no Monica. With her clear, dark eyes and her prim and proper ways, she was desperate to save him from the clutches of demon alcohol.</p><p>Part of the problem was how good she\u2019d felt in his arms, all soft and feminine. The last time he\u2019d held a woman had been . . . longer than he cared to think about, Chet realized. It was this job, he decided, that soured him on relationships. No one was faithful anymore, not according to the statistics he\u2019d collected. The child custody cases were the worst and he\u2019d sworn off those. After he\u2019d left the police department years earlier, he\u2019d floundered for a bit before deciding to work as a private investigator. What a crock of bull this had turned out to be. The time was fast approaching when he\u2019d need to find something else. He wouldn\u2019t go back to the force, not after Tom\u2019s death. He didn\u2019t trust himself, not anymore. His partner had gotten killed, and Chet had accepted responsibility for the loss of his friend. The incident continued to haunt him. There were certain things in life a man didn\u2019t put behind him, and this was one.</p><p>For reasons he couldn\u2019t explain, the erstwhile missionary drifted back into his mind, with her warm, pleading gaze and her soft, sweet mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou know, what she really needs is to be kissed,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cNone of this pansy stuff of holding hands and gazing longingly into each other\u2019s eyes either.\u201d</p><p>Lou glanced his way and without comment continued to polish the sleek wooden surface of the bar. After a moment, he paused and scratched his head. \u201cYou looking to talk?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d The bartender resumed his task.</p><p>Remembering the way she\u2019d flung herself against the tavern door produced another burst of laughter. The buttons of her jacket had strained with the effort until she resembled a martyr tied to the stake. She had nice, full breasts, although heaven knew she did everything she could to disguise the fact that she was a woman. If he ever did have the opportunity to kiss her, which was highly unlikely, the first thing he\u2019d do was pull the pins from her hair. It was a travesty to keep it twisted away from her face that way. She\u2019d have thick, luxuriant hair and he\u2019d run his fingers through it. He imagined she\u2019d put up a fuss at that. Anything remotely related to sensual pleasure was sure to be sin, pure, unadulterated sin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chet knew her type. The mission house down the street from his office was filled with do-gooders thinking their efforts with the derelicts and vagrants was going to make a difference. Chet felt sorry for them more than he did the street people they struggled to reach with their message.</p><p>Then why couldn\u2019t he stop thinking about her? The hell if he knew. The hell if he cared. One consolation, he wasn\u2019t likely to run into her again.</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember you, Mr. Lundberg,\u201d Mrs. Burchell, the caseworker from New Life Adoption Agency, assured him over the telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear from you again.\u201d</p><p>Andrew rolled the mechanical pencil between his palms, praying he was doing the right thing. \u201cI\u2019d like to know how difficult it would be for my wife and me to resubmit our application.\u201d He leaned against the back of his chair. Leah had been on his mind all day and he was worried about her.</p> <p>It was so unfair that they couldn\u2019t have children. What troubled him most was that there didn\u2019t seem to be any physical reason. They\u2019d spent years, and thousands of dollars, working with fertility specialists. Leah\u2019s life was governed by that ridiculous book she kept. He swore she\u2019d documented her temperature every morning for the last seven years.</p><p>Perhaps if they\u2019d been able to pinpoint the problem as his, Leah might have been able to accept their situation.</p><p>\u201cI have your file right here,\u201d the caseworker went on to say. \u201cI know you and your wife were terribly disappointed when Melinda Phillips decided to rescind the adoption of her infant son. It doesn\u2019t happen often, but unfortunately these girls do change their minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Andrew said, not wanting to rehash the details. Having the birth mother change her mind had been much harder on Leah than on him. They\u2019d gone to the hospital, their hearts filled with joy, only to return empty-handed an hour later. Afterward Leah had sat for hours alone in the nursery they\u2019d so lovingly prepared. Nothing Andrew could say reached her. He\u2019d been disappointed too and for a while there\u2019d been a strain between them. Then one day he returned home from the office and discovered that Leah had dismantled the nursery. She calmly announced that she\u2019d withdrawn their application from New Life and that they\u2019d simply wait for her to become pregnant and bear a child of their own. She refused to subject them to that kind of torment again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to resubmit your names,\u201d Mrs. Burchell said, \u201cbut I must warn you there are fewer babies available for adoption now than before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long would you predict?\u201d</p><p>The caseworker hesitated. \u201cI can\u2019t really say. It\u2019s different with every couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Watcombs?\u201d Andrew asked. \u201cWe went through the orientation classes with them three years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the Watcombs. Jessie and Ken, am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Has their adoption gone through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll have an infant for them soon.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew\u2019s hopes plummeted. The Watcombs were special people and he couldn\u2019t imagine any young mother not choosing them to rear her child.</p><p>\u201cYou were in the same orientation class as the Sterlings, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Andrew allowed the name to filter through his mind. \u201cHe was a fireman as I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the couple. They adopted a baby girl last October.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be pleased.\u201d</p><p>He was, of course, but a small part of him couldn\u2019t help being envious. Leah desperately wanted a child, and in an effort to reassure her he\u2019d downplayed his own desire for a family. He loved his wife and would give anything for them to have a child.</p><p>\u201cDo you still want me to resubmit your name?\u201d Mrs. Burchell asked after a moment\u2019s silence.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, his hand tightening around the receiver. If it took another five years or more, then that was just how long they\u2019d need to wait. That he was doing this behind Leah\u2019s back didn\u2019t sit well with him, but some action needed to be taken, and this seemed the most logical choice. If they were chosen by a birth mother again, then they\u2019d make the necessary adjustments. A child was welcome into their lives at any time. Love guaranteed.</p><p>For the life of her, Monica hadn\u2019t been able to forget the private investigator. Heaven knew she\u2019d tried. He was little better than an alcoholic, drinking beer in the middle of the day. Not only that, he\u2019d been arrogant, rude, and curt with her. He\u2019d treated her as if she were a senseless child when she\u2019d tried to help him.</p><p>Monica didn\u2019t understand what it was about this one man that intrigued her so. She\u2019d gone to bed that night and dreamed of him. She\u2019d woken breathless, her heart pounding double time. A woman had no control over her dreams, Monica assured herself. If she had, Monica certainly wouldn\u2019t have allowed that . . . man to touch her. The very idea was appalling. No, Monica corrected, closing her eyes and shaking her head, that wasn\u2019t the truth. It was the problem. She had thought about him touching her, kissing her. Her untamed imagination had taken over and she\u2019d allowed it to happen in her dreams.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d her father said, strolling into the living room. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d He settled down in the leather chair by the fireplace and reached for the evening paper. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to need you tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d He seemed to forget she had a job and even if she did work as the church secretary it was a demanding position. Her father would cover for her if necessary, but she would rather he asked first instead of volunteering her services, which was something he often did.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Ferdnand just phoned and she can\u2019t be a bell ringer for the shift she signed up to take last Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Dad.\u201d Standing on a cold street corner and collecting charitable donations was the last way Monica wished to spend an afternoon. An hour never lasted so long and by the end of her shift she\u2019d be frozen solid.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask if it wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d It was useless to argue with him. The man had the patience of Job and an answer for every argument.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s downtown so you\u2019ll be sure to get plenty of traffic,\u201d her father added, reaching for the sports section of the newspaper and folding it open.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She stabbed the needle into the fabric and set aside her needlepoint. After working on this Ten Commandment project for weeks she was only on the fourth commandment, which meant she hadn\u2019t a prayer of finishing before Christmas. She studied the tiny stitches. Ironically the one she was currently stitching stated Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother. God must have worked it out that way, sealing any argument she might have given.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d her father asked her unexpectedly, momentarily setting the paper aside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, then amended, \u201ca little tired perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought as much. You don\u2019t seem to be yourself lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this thing with Patrick hurt you and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatrick is a friend, Dad. He was never anything more. I don\u2019t know why you insist upon dragging his name into every conversation.\u201d It was a white lie to suggest she hadn\u2019t cared about Patrick, but sometimes she found those necessary, although she was never comfortable stretching the truth.</p><p>\u201cI noticed Michael talking to you the other day. He\u2019s a very nice young man.\u201d He eyed her speculatively as if waiting for her to comment.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d she agreed. But Michael didn\u2019t stir her blood, he didn\u2019t make her heart throb and the thought of him kissing her produced not so must as a whit of excitement.</p><p>Her father was right, there was definitely something wrong with her.</p><p>The following afternoon, Monica was dressed in her dark blue suit, standing on the corner of Fifth and University, ringing her little heart out. Surely there was a reward awaiting her in heaven for this.</p><p>A man dressed in leather and wearing enough gold to strangle himself stopped and inserted a ten-dollar bill in the bright red pot. When Monica thanked him, he insisted upon \u201cgiving her five.\u201d It took her a good three minutes to realize what he intended. He was simply looking to slap her hand. He ambled away, suggesting she get with it, whatever or whomever \u201cit\u201d was.</p><p>Okay, so she wasn\u2019t cool, if that was the current vernacular. Nor was she hip or groovy or several other words that came to mind. She was God\u2019s willing servant. All right, she wasn\u2019t so willing just then, but she was doing her part and that was all that mattered.</p><p>Her ears were cold and her fingers had lost their feeling and she had another half hour to go when it happened.</p><p>It was him.</p><p>The man who\u2019d caught her in his arms three days earlier, the one she\u2019d attempted to restrain from entering the Blue Goose. He was standing on the other side of the street waiting for the traffic to pass so he could cross. Everyone else would wait for the green light and the walk sign, but not him. Oh, no, he was too impatient for that.</p><p>She stopped ringing the bell, then started again with a vengeance, closing her eyes, hoping with everything in her that he\u2019d simply walk past and not notice it was her.</p><p>Monica should have realized that would have been asking too much.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he said, strolling all the way around her. \u201cAnd who do we have here? Monica, am I right?\u201d</p><p>She ignored him and stared straight ahead, jerking the small bell back and forth for all she was worth, her shoulders so stiff they ached.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mighty cold to be standing outside for any length of time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Monica didn\u2019t deign to answer him. A lady in a fur coat walked past and dropped a few coins into the red kettle. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Monica said from pure habit.</p><p>\u201cThe same to you,\u201d the private investigator answered.</p><p>\u201cPlease leave me alone,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me I asked the same thing of you recently and did it help? Oh, no, you were convinced I needed to be saved.\u201d He flung his hands into the air. \u201cHallelujah, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She tried again.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life, sister,\u201d he responded.</p><p>\u201cIf you continue to pester me you\u2019ll leave me no choice but to contact the police and have you forcibly removed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThreats?\u201d He folded his arms over his broad chest and arched both brows in mock terror. \u201cSo you want to involve the authorities. Fine. Good luck finding a cop walking his beat. In case you weren\u2019t aware, the city\u2019s seriously understaffed, and this time of year is busier than most.\u201d</p><p>Monica knew God was looking out for her when a city cop turned the corner just then, casually sauntering down the sidewalk. \u201cOfficer, Officer,\u201d she called, wasting no time. \u201cThis man is bothering me.\u201d</p><p>The policeman, who was tall and burly beneath his thick coat and cap, was casually swinging his billy club. \u201cYou troubling this young lady, Chet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was just her luck that they knew each other.</p><p>\u201cBothering this woman?

Let me assure you, you\u2019re in no danger from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dennis,\u201d Chet said and dipped his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true,\u201d Monica tried again, more adamantly this time. \u201cI politely asked him to leave and he refused.\u201d</p><p>Dennis bounced the billy club against his open palm a couple of times. \u201cChet, stop pestering this pretty young lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p> <p>Dennis touched the tip of his hat. \u201cHe\u2019ll leave you alone now, miss.\u201d With that he strolled away.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to leave, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, sweetheart, he\u2019s got better things to do than listen to you making a fuss over nothing. This is a public sidewalk, there\u2019s nothing Dennis can do but ask me to move on, which he\u2019s already done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you insist upon doing this?\u201d Monica demanded, straightening her shoulders. She forced herself to look directly ahead and away from him, because looking at Chet caused her stomach to flutter as if she were coming down with the flu.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, raising both hands, \u201cI\u2019m paying you back for what you did the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were a major pest. Now you know how it feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for me to apologize, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d He walked all the way around her once more, then stood directly in front of her, hands on his hips. \u201cYou know, you might really be something in the looks department if you ever decided to wear makeup.\u201d</p><p>Monica ignored the comment.</p><p>\u201cA little blush and eye liner aren\u2019t tools of the devil, you know.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips to restrain herself from chastising him the way he deserved.</p><p>\u201cMy, oh, my, look at that sour puss. I was right the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d she demanded before she could stop herself.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you really need is to be kissed, and sweetheart, I\u2019m the man to do it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Chet never intended to kiss Monica. He\u2019d taken delight in teasing her and she was easy game. Her face flushed with color, brightening her cheeks, and her eyes snapped with outrage, challenging him. Chet was ready to laugh and walk away when a Metro bus came rushing down the street, the thick tires spraying the sidewalk with a shower of icy, muddy water.</p><p>Monica, standing as close to the curb as she was, would receive the brunt of the spray. Thinking quickly, Chet caught her by the shoulders and whirled her around. The bus passed and the muddy water sprayed him against the back of his legs. He grimaced as the icy liquid soaked through his trousers at his calves.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Monica demanded.</p><p>Her back was against the brick building and she was breathing hard. Her breasts rose up and down and her hands clenched at the lapels of his trench coat as though to push him away. When she moistened her lips as if she fully expected him to follow through with his threat, it was his undoing. He felt as if a fist had been plowed into his gut. He didn\u2019t want to kiss her any longer, he needed to.</p><p>\u201cNo, please,\u201d she blurted out, sounding as if she were near panic.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he whispered coaxingly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to hurt in the least.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her head to one side but he caught her by the chin. By all that was right he should have released her then, but the temptation was too strong, too sweet and piercing to ignore.</p><p>Slowly he lowered his mouth to hers with the confidence of years of experience. His lips cut off her gasp of protest, and the strong pressure of his mouth opened hers to him. She tasted good, damn good, a hell of a lot better than he expected. When his tongue entered her mouth, her nails dug into his coat, and then she amazed him and quite possibly herself with a soft, womanly sigh of pleasure. Chet slanted his head and kissed her with months of pent-up passion.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to be so demanding, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself.</p><p>With effort, Chet forced himself to break off the intensity of the kiss and wean himself away from her with a series of short, nibbling ones. With a reluctance he didn\u2019t dare question, he lifted his mouth from hers. He would have enjoyed continuing this experiment and given the opportunity, a hell of a lot more.</p><p>Monica\u2019s chest was heaving and her eyes were closed. Her head was slightly lowered but not enough to disguise the soft, feminine look about her. He noticed that half the pins were missing from her hair so that it fell haphazardly over one shoulder. Hell, he didn\u2019t even remember doing anything more than plowing his hands into the thick fullness and positioning her head so he could kiss her properly.</p><p>Her eyes slowly opened and she looked slightly dazed and definitely pale. She gazed at him steadily for just a moment and then quickly lowered her eyes. Her slender throat moved up and down as she swallowed and it seemed that she was getting ready to speak.</p><p>\u201cI . . . wish you hadn\u2019t done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he returned, sounding far more cocky than he intended. Insolence was part and parcel of his job. He didn\u2019t like it in himself, but he didn\u2019t know how to stop.</p><p>\u201cPlease, will you leave me alone now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you really want?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but refused to meet his eyes.</p><p>He stepped away from her and she immediately went about tucking her hair back into place, her hands trembling so badly that Chet had to resist offering to help.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a kiss,\u201d he said in a weak effort to comfort her, although he was beginning to feel he was the one who needed reassurance. This woman was completely unaware of what a powerful punch she packed. She\u2019d felt good in his arms, as if that was where she was supposed to be. The thought didn\u2019t sit well with Chet. Nor was he keen on admitting how difficult it was to walk away from her.</p><p>\u201cI . . . think it would be best if you left,\u201d she said, struggling valiantly to compose herself. She refused to look up at him.</p><p>Chet\u2019s mind was sluggish and his pulse still hadn\u2019t returned to normal. He nodded, unable to think of anything more to say. As he moved away from her, he found the small, silver bell she\u2019d dropped on the sidewalk. Stooping, he retrieved it for her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and Chet stepped away from her, walking backward. He bumped into a lamp post, his shoulder hitting it hard enough against the steel column to jar him. Sucking in a deep breath, he rubbed his hand over the tender spot, turned, and walked away.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about what had just happened. He\u2019d kissed a woman who, for all intents and purposes, was living the life of a nun. It shouldn\u2019t have been this good. One kiss should have been enough to cure him of ever thinking about her again. He could tell right now that it wasn\u2019t going to happen that way.</p><p>By the time Chet returned to his office, he discovered he was shaking like a leaf. He\u2019d faced danger a dozen times, hell, more than that, but no encounter with life or death had left him so jittery that he needed to sit down. It took a morally uptight missionary intent on saving the world to reduce him to this.</p><p>\u201cOh, Leah, look,\u201d Pam Hewitt said, holding up a thick cable-knit sweater the color of winter wheat. \u201cDoug would love this.\u201d She checked the price tag and then slowly shook her head. \u201cUnfortunately I can\u2019t afford two hundred bucks for a sweater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were shopping for a party dress for you,\u201d Leah reminded her friend. They\u2019d known each other since university days and kept in close contact although they weren\u2019t able to get together often. Pam had temporarily traded in her nurse\u2019s uniform to be a full-time housewife and mother to her three youngsters. Leah loved each one, but Scotty, the just-turned three-year-old, held a special place in her heart. The baby Andrew and she were to have adopted had been born around the same time. Somehow Leah had transferred to Scotty all the love she had for the child that was to have been hers. She gave Pam\u2019s three children gifts every Christmas and invented excuses for outings with them, but it was Scotty who ruled her heart.</p><p>\u201cI hate Christmas parties,\u201d Pam muttered, folding the sweater and setting it back on the table. She ran her hand over the top and sighed expressively. \u201cI was thinking I\u2019d cut down the fancy maternity dress I wore a couple of years ago and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Leah insisted. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find you a dress that will make you feel like a queen for Doug\u2019s Christmas party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will take some doing,\u201d Pam muttered. \u201cTwo years at home with the kids and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve lost it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it,\u201d Pam admitted slowly. \u201cI think a part of the brain starts to deteriorate after so many years of dealing with diapers, bottles, and potty training. It\u2019s like you\u2019re on the children\u2019s level for so much of the day that you lose the ability to communicate with other adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this tells me is that you need to get away more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true,\u201d Pam agreed, \u201cbut you wouldn\u2019t believe the trouble it is to find a baby-sitter, especially on weekdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about taking some time for yourself while the kids go down for their naps?\u201d</p><p>Pam laughed softly as they headed toward the escalator. \u201cNap time is like an oasis in the middle of the day. I treasure every moment of that hour, but lately even that time\u2019s been robbed from me. I\u2019m sewing Scotty and Jason Batman pajamas and that\u2019s the only free time I have to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBatman pajamas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re crazy about him and Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sew in the evenings?\u201d Leah suggested. It made perfect sense to her since the three were generally in bed by eight.</p><p>Pam laughed and shook her head. \u201cBecause, my dear friend, I\u2019m too pooped. Honestly, I head for bed no more than an hour after the kids. I never dreamed I\u2019d be in bed before nine. Remember me, the original night owl? Trust me, kids will do that to you.\u201d</p><p>A pang of envy struck Leah at the thought of her life being dominated by the demands of a houseful of children. Then again, the grass always appeared greener on the other side of the fence. More than once, Pam had said how much she envied Leah her freedom.</p><p>Freedom. True, she often had time on her hands, but for what?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a budget, you know,\u201d Pam complained when they reached Nordstrom\u2019s second floor.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop?\u201d Leah demanded, laughing. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to the women\u2019s section yet and already you\u2019re convinced you aren\u2019t going to find anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy old maternity dress isn\u2019t all that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam!\u201d Leah braced her hands against her hips and glared at her friend. \u201cNow I understand why Doug insisted I go shopping with you. He knew darn good and well that you\u2019d end up buying something for everyone else and nothing for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see that darling pinafore,\u201d Pam said, pointing toward the children\u2019s section. \u201cDiane would look like an angel dressed in that.\u201d</p><p>Leah looped her arm through Pam\u2019s and steered her in the opposite direction. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Hog-tie me and force me to try on several dresses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose. I\u2019m taking you directly to the dressing room and bringing the party dresses in to you.\u201d</p><p>Pam\u2019s shoulders sagged with defeat as they entered the dressing room area. \u201cAll right, just try to find something reasonably priced, will you?\u201d Leah opened the white louvered door and gently pushed her friend inside.</p><p>Pam stuck out her hand and waved her index finger. \u201cCheck on the sale rack first. I\u2019ll feel better about spending so much money on myself if the dress is discounted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you mind,\u201d Leah argued. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to let you look at the price tag.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, Leah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try to argue with me. I\u2019d have thought you\u2019d know better by now.\u201d Smiling to herself, Leah left the dressing room.</p><p>\u201cMy hips aren\u2019t nearly as slender as they used to be either,\u201d Pam called after her. \u201cYou\u2019d better start with a size twelve instead of a ten . . . better make that a fourteen.\u201d</p><p>Leah stopped long enough to roll her eyes, then headed for a rack of newly arrived fashions. It took less than five minutes to find a wide selection that would suit her friend.</p><p>\u201cMercy, where are you?\u201d Goodness called, frantically circling Nordstrom\u2019s like the second hand of a clock gone berserk.</p><p>Mercy turned around to find Goodness, her wings all aflutter, breezing six feet off the ground, close to a state of panic.</p> <p>\u201cI need to talk to you right away,\u201d Goodness said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d Mercy called, wondering what could possibly have gone wrong so quickly. \u201cI\u2019m on the light fixture.\u201d</p><p>Goodness soared to her side, rustling the dress display and toppling a mannequin. Apparently feeling guilty, she scooped up the lifeless form and set it back into place to the horror of a sales clerk who gasped and placed her hand over her heart to watch a lifeless form right itself.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Mercy shouted. \u201cWould you stop before you get us both into trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need help,\u201d Goodness blurted out for the second time, joining Mercy who was dangling from the light fixture.</p><p>\u201cSo soon? You just received the assignment. What could have possibly gone wrong?\u201d</p><p>Goodness, who was easily flustered, looked helpless and confused. She cast a pleading look at Mercy. \u201cI knew I was in way over my head when Gabriel first gave me this assignment, but I wanted to help Monica Fischer. You know I\u2019m a sucker for romance, and finding her a husband didn\u2019t sound as if it would be the least bit difficult.\u201d She stopped long enough to draw in another deep breath. \u201cNow the poor girl\u2019s more confused than ever and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing . . . well, obviously it\u2019s something, but . . . oh, dear, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve made a terrible mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it this has something to do with finding Monica a husband?\u201d</p><p>Goodness nodded energetically. \u201cI found the most suitable young man who has a wonderful heart for God. He directs the choir and he\u2019s half in love with her already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica isn\u2019t the least bit excited about him. She has this dangerous attraction for that . . . that private eye. They\u2019re completely incompatible. Why, a union between the two of them will never do, and I fear I\u2019m the one responsible for them meeting.\u201d</p><p>Mercy frowned. \u201cGoodness, when will you ever learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d Flustered, she wrung her hands and eyed her fellow angel. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I know that was you riding up and down the escalator just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known that was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I made an educated guess,\u201d Goodness said confidently. \u201cA woman\u2019s being treated with smelling salts and two kids are telling everyone what they saw, and it sounds to me as if they were describing you. Who else do you know with long, blond hair, deep blue eyes, and magnificent wings? You know better than most that children\u2019s spiritual eyes have yet to close. You were taking a terrible chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as I thought. Mercy, what are you going to do if Gabriel hears about this? You know he will eventually. Why, he could pull you off of this assignment in nothing flat and with good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he won\u2019t,\u201d Mercy said with utter confidence.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019d never have assigned me to this prayer request if he had anyone else to send. We both know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he might never give you another assignment if you continue to do crazy stunts like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he will. Gabriel has a soft spot in his heart for the three of us. I venture to say we\u2019re his favorites, although he\u2019d never let us know that.\u201d</p><p>Goodness stared at her with round, disbelieving eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll forgive me just about anything,\u201d Mercy continued, undaunted, \u201cbecause I\u2019m going to find a way to teach Leah what she must learn and as soon as she does, she\u2019ll become pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy, have you been sniffing the eggnog again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got the most difficult assignment by far. How can you be so confident Leah\u2019s ever going to learn what she must when so many others have failed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple,\u201d Mercy said with a cocky tilt to her head, \u201cI\u2019m going to teach her. Now stop worrying about me. Let\u2019s concentrate on what\u2019s happening with you and Monica Fischer.\u201d</p><p>Goodness adjusted her wings around the troublesome light fixture. \u201cI hate to admit it, but I\u2019m worried. She really likes this Chet fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChet who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChet Costello. He\u2019s a private investigator and from what I\u2019ve managed to learn of him . . . let me just say this, Gabriel would need to assign a legion of angels to work with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure Monica\u2019s infatuated with him?\u201d</p><p>Goodness nodded. \u201cI read her journal this morning and it was full of all the things she felt while he kissed her. She said she never knew that kissing could be this good or that a woman felt those kinds of things when a man touched her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d Mercy waved her hand in front of her heated face.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s not the half of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wrote that she felt herself responding to him even when she promised herself she wouldn\u2019t and how disappointed she was when he stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Michael knows about Chet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows, not even her father. She raced home afterwards and went directly to her room where she wrote everything down. When her father came to ask if she wanted dinner, Monica claimed she wasn\u2019t hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing is better than food?\u201d This was a whole new thought to Mercy.</p><p>\u201cApparently so.\u201d</p><p>Goodness wrung her hands once more, then blurted out, \u201cSay something. Anything. I need help.\u201d</p><p>Mercy slowly shook her head back and forth. \u201cYou\u2019ve got trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be here. What do you suggest?\u201d</p><p>Mercy thought long and hard. \u201cWe both need to talk to Shirley. She\u2019s much better at deciphering these matters than we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s meet at Reverend Fischer\u2019s church at midnight in the choir loft,\u201d Goodness suggested as she elegantly slid off the dangling fixture. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>Mercy nodded.</p><p>Goodness fully intended to leave the shopping mall right then and return to Monica, who was sitting in the church office typing up the bulletin for the Sunday morning worship service. But when she shot past a video store, she skidded to a stop. Mercy seemed confident that Gabriel would leave them on their assignments because he was so shorthanded. Maybe she should test her friend\u2019s theory, and have a little fun herself.</p><p>Row upon row of television screens faced her. There must have been over fifty in various sizes and shapes, all tuned to the same channel. The temptation was too much to resist.</p><p>She hesitated and laughed silently at the thought of her face showing up on all fifty screens at once. The mere suggestion was her downfall. If Mercy could ride up and down the escalator then she should be able to enjoy a few short moments of notoriety.</p><p>\u201cThis is our best model,\u201d the salesman was saying, stepping over to the wide twenty-five-inch screen. The salesman was busily showing an older couple the capabilities of the remote control when Goodness popped onto the screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d The grandmotherly woman pointed to the television.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to be a . . . woman with wings,\u201d the man with her added.</p><p>\u201cWings?\u201d The salesman quickly adjusted the buttons. \u201cWe had it tuned to a game show earlier. It\u2019s nothing to worry about, folks, this happens sometimes. I\u2019ll just change the channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same woman appears to be on that channel as well,\u201d the woman said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d say it was an . . . angel. Do you think she\u2019s trying to tell us something, Delbert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sure is,\u201d the man grumbled. \u201cShe\u2019s saying we shouldn\u2019t be buying this fancy new television when the one we\u2019ve got is perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. This is the punishment you get for skipping mass last Sunday. God\u2019s sent this angel to show you the error of your ways. Then again\u201d\u2014she hesitated while Goodness adjusted her wings for show\u2014\u201cshe might be telling us we should pick up some lottery tickets on our way home.\u201d</p><p>The salesman was becoming more and more agitated as he punched a variety of buttons on the remote control. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s been some mistake.\u201d He looked around and shouted, \u201cHarry! I think it might be a good idea if I have the manager take a look at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen enough,\u201d the older man said, reaching for his wife\u2019s arm. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to do with you missing church, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d her husband said with annoyance.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to stop for lottery tickets, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t do this nearly enough.\u201d Jody\u2019s mother set the pot of tea on the oak kitchen table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Jody said, slipping into the chair across from her mother. She didn\u2019t drop by to visit her mother as often as she had before her father\u2019s death earlier in the year. Her childhood home stirred far too many memories. Privately Jody wondered how her mother managed. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t so difficult to understand. Jody continued to live in the tiny two-bedroom house she and Jeff had purchased when she\u2019d first learned she was pregnant with Timmy. Giving up even this small part of her life with her late husband was more than she could have borne.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Timmy this evening?\u201d Helen Chandler wanted to know.</p><p>Jody smiled although she knew her mother didn\u2019t understand her amusement. \u201cHe\u2019s spending the night with Rick Trenton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was Ricky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the fourth grade this year and suddenly Ricky is Rick. Timmy is Tim to all his friends now too. He\u2019s growing up more and more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that sort of thing happened until junior high.\u201d</p><p>Jody had been amazed herself. \u201cKids mature much faster these days. Generally Rick spends the night with us, but his mother just had a baby and Timmy\u2019s enthralled with the little tyke. He . . . he went so far as to suggest that I remarry so he could have a brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you, Mom, it threw me for a loop. I found a letter in Timmy\u2019s binder. His class was assigned to write a letter and he opted to address his to God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat grandson of mine is one smart cookie. What did he have to say?\u201d</p><p>Jody stirred a spoonful of sugar into her tea with enough energy for some to slosh over the rim of the delicate china cup. \u201cHe wrote about needing a dad.\u201d</p><p>Helen Chandler grew quiet at that. Jody expected her mother to laugh or perhaps lecture, but she hadn\u2019t expected her to say nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any comment to make?\u201d she asked, eyeing her mother speculatively.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, but I\u2019m not so sure you want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>At this point Jody was more than willing to listen to words of wisdom. She\u2019d thought of little else but the letter from the moment it had slipped from Timmy\u2019s binder. The conversation with her son had served to disconcert her even more. This hadn\u2019t been an impulse; he\u2019d been serious.</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead, Mom, say what you want and I\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>Her mother smiled and reached for Jody\u2019s hand, squeezing it gently. \u201cI don\u2019t think I fully appreciated your grief when Jeff died. I ached for you and would have given anything to bring Jeff back, but the depth of your pain escaped me until . . . until this past year.\u201d She paused as if she needed to steel herself. \u201cAfter Ralph died I knew what you\u2019d endured. The death of a loved one is the sharpest pain a human can experience. I felt like a piece of myself had died with your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom.\u201d Jody\u2019s grip on her mother\u2019s hand tightened, to let the gesture say what she couldn\u2019t because of the huge constriction blocking her throat. They were close, had always been close. Jody had been an only child and the bond had been firm and strong between her and her parents.</p><p>\u201cI can appreciate far more the agony you endured when you lost Jeff. I understand why your grief has lingered all these years, but I also know Timmy is right. The time is long past due for you to get on with your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, please, and when I\u2019ve finished you can say what you wish.</p><p>\u201cTake the love you and Jeff shared and place it in the most tender part of your heart. Treasure the few short years you had together as a precious gift God gave you and then offer it back to Him in gratitude that you found such a special man to love.\u201d</p><p>Tears rolled unchecked down Jody\u2019s cheeks. She\u2019d assumed the well was dry after spending the night looking through the photo album, but they returned fresh and hot, streaming down her face.</p> <p>\u201cIn my heart I know Jeff wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to grieve this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that too,\u201d Jody whispered, struggling to check the emotion. She\u2019d wanted to be strong when she spoke to her mother, but it took only a few words for her to realize how weak she actually was.</p><p>\u201cMeeting other men, even marrying again, doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop loving Jeff,\u201d her mother continued.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever stop loving him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that. It would be impossible for me to stop loving your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is time for me to start dating again, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Even as Jody made the suggestion, she couldn\u2019t help wondering if she was doing the right thing. It didn\u2019t feel right, but then nothing had from the moment she\u2019d received word Jeff was gone. It seemed as if her world had been knocked off its orbit and would never right itself. Now her mother and her son were saying different. There was a new life waiting for her and the possibility of finding love again, if she were willing to put the past behind her and march forward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s past time,\u201d her mother told her gently. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been asked out over the years. You\u2019re a beautiful young woman.\u201d</p><p>Jody nodded, twisting a tissue with her hands. \u201cGlen Richardson surprised me last week with an invitation to dinner. I was so shocked I didn\u2019t know what to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve heard you mention his name before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of the attorneys at the firm. I don\u2019t work directly with him, but it seems we continually bump into each other at the copy machine. It\u2019s become something of a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, Mother, I don\u2019t remember. I made up some ridiculous excuse, but he said he\u2019d ask again and he probably will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when he does?\u201d her mother prompted.</p><p>\u201cWhen he does,\u201d Jody said, clenching the tissue in both hands, \u201cI\u2019ll . . . I\u2019ll promise to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJody Marie Potter!\u201d</p><p>Jody laughed and relaxed against the back of her chair. \u201cOh, all right. One date, just to test the waters.\u201d</p><p>Her mother smiled broadly, looking downright pleased with herself.</p><p>The phone was ringing when Jody let herself into her house later that same night. Setting down her purse, she hurried into the kitchen and caught it on the fourth ring, just before the answering machine took over.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, her voice shaking with breathlessness.</p><p>\u201cJody?\u201d</p><p>The voice was strangely familiar. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Glen . . . Glen Richardson. I hope I didn\u2019t catch you at an inconvenient time.\u201d</p><p>Jody\u2019s shoulders sagged against the wall. \u201cNo. I just unlocked the door and had to run to catch the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe funniest thing just happened. I was thinking of calling you and for the life of me, I couldn\u2019t find your number. Then I walked into the kitchen and found it attached to the phone. Heaven only knows how it got there. It seemed fate was telling me to give you a jingle,\u201d Glen said, sounding confused even now. \u201cAnd to think I caught you just as you walked in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got back from visiting my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ve already had dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glen, but we ordered Chinese take-out.\u201d He sounded so bewildered that she almost felt sorry for him. \u201cWhat are you doing, sitting home alone on a Friday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best gal turned me down for a date.\u201d</p><p>It took Jody a moment to realize he was talking about her, leading her to wonder what excuse she\u2019d given him earlier.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I should suggest a deli sandwich and a couple of sodas for the next time we meet at the copy machine. Larry Williams warned me that you don\u2019t date often.\u201d</p><p>Often. The last time she\u2019d gone out with a man, she\u2019d ended up marrying him. Jeff had been persistent too, she remembered, unwilling to take no for an answer. He\u2019d wooed her carefully and when they\u2019d fallen in love, it was the kind of love that was meant to last a lifetime. She might marry again, even give birth to another child, but she\u2019d never stop loving Jeff. This was her vow, to his memory and to the extraordinary love they shared.</p><p>\u201cJody?\u201d Glen said, interrupting her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s short notice and all, but how about a movie? I understand there\u2019re several good ones playing. How would you feel about that? I could meet you at the theater if that\u2019d make you more comfortable,\u201d he added, rushing the words together in his eagerness.</p><p>So soon. It was happening so fast, much faster than she\u2019d expected. Much too soon, long before she was ready. Then she remembered her mother\u2019s words about placing the love she shared with Jeff in the most tender part of her heart. She didn\u2019t know what to make of him finding her number pasted on his telephone.</p><p>\u201cA movie,\u201d she repeated. There was a six-plex less than a mile from her house. \u201cAh, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Glen said, sounding a little like Timmy when she\u2019d given in on something he\u2019d really wanted. \u201cThis is just great. I promise you, you won\u2019t be sorry. Just you wait and see.\u201d</p><p>Jody wondered if that were possible.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Shirley loved old white churches with tall steeples and huge bells. In the Reverend Lloyd Fischer\u2019s church she felt a certain kinship with this righteous man of God. She was waiting for her two compatriots in the choir loft, which was situated up the winding stairway in the back of the old church. The freshly polished pews gleamed in the moonlight and the scent of lemon oil wafted toward her.</p><p>She frowned as she viewed the magnificent old organ. It would take a minor miracle to keep Mercy away from this. The public address system didn\u2019t bear thinking about.</p><p>\u201cShirley?\u201d Goodness arrived first, agitated and impatient, racing up and down the center aisle.</p><p>\u201cUp here.\u201d</p><p>Goodness joined her, hurling herself over the wooden railing of the choir loft. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mercy? She should have been here by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she will be soon.\u201d</p><p>No sooner had Shirley spoken than Mercy appeared. \u201cI\u2019m up here. No one bothered to tell me Leah Lundberg\u2019s a night owl.\u201d She sagged into one of the choir chairs and tilted back her head. \u201cI\u2019m bushed. Leah had me running from one end of the shopping mall to the next. After she found her friend an absolutely delightful party dress, she took off on her own and shopped for hours. I didn\u2019t know a single human being possessed so much energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all learning lessons about earthlings,\u201d Shirley maintained. Her own experiences had been exhausting as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Goodness joined in. \u201cAll Monica\u2019s done since Chet kissed her is stew in the juices of her self-righteousness. She\u2019s convinced God never intended a good Christian woman to experience desire. I think it must be the first time she was ever kissed, I mean really kissed. I don\u2019t mind telling you, this whole situation has got me plenty worried.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou?\u201d Mercy cried, and a look of frustration and bewilderment marked her face. \u201cHow am I supposed to help Leah when she crams every spare minute of the day with mindless activity? It isn\u2019t any wonder the woman has no peace. She doesn\u2019t take time to listen to herself, let alone anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis must be a common trait with humans,\u201d Shirley added thoughtfully. \u201cHave you seen Jody\u2019s yard? Why, it\u2019s meticulous. The woman must spend every available minute maintaining those flower beds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped to make a real difference in Leah\u2019s life,\u201d Mercy continued, \u201cand now I wonder if that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>Shirley surveyed the small group of prayer ambassadors. She was new at this and uncertain herself, but then they were all relatively inexperienced and it made sense that they help each other.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you, Shirley?\u201d Mercy asked, her gaze skittering past the organ and then drifting lazily toward the huge pipes. Shirley could all but see Mercy\u2019s mind feverishly devising ways of getting at that organ.</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, things are developing nicely with Jody and her son, Timmy,\u201d Shirley said, walking directly in front of the organ, cutting off Mercy\u2019s view. \u201cJody went out on her first date in years this evening and afterwards Glen asked her out for dinner and she agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlen? Who\u2019s Glen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn attorney. They work for the same law firm. Glen\u2019s hardworking and sincere. From what I was able to learn about him, he\u2019s interested in settling down and starting a family. I\u2019m sure once Timmy meets him everything will fall neatly into place.\u201d</p><p>Goodness slapped one disgruntled wing against her side. \u201cI\u2019m going to do my very best to remain angelic here, but it seems to me you received a cushy assignment while Mercy and I are at our wits end.\u201d</p> <p>Mercy chimed in in agreement. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t guessed, Goodness and I are experiencing some minor difficulties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might help,\u201d Shirley said in gentle, forgiving tones, \u201cif you stayed away from escalators and television screens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard?\u201d Goodness ventured.</p><p>Shirley nodded. \u201cAnd so has Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Mercy closed her eyes. \u201cIs he furious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t pulled you off the assignment, has he?\u201d Shirley asked. \u201cI heard what you said this afternoon, and you\u2019re right. Gabriel doesn\u2019t have the angel-power to replace you just now and I\u2019m sure all will be forgiven if, and it\u2019s a big if, Mercy is able to help Leah find her peace. Goodness, you\u2019ve got to help Monica find a decent husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought it\u2019d be easier than it is,\u201d Goodness confessed in a small voice.</p><p>Mercy joined her friend, sagging defeatedly into a chair. \u201cWe could both do with some suggestions. This prayer business is difficult work.\u201d</p><p>Goodness agreed with a sharp nod. \u201cBeing around humans for any length of time is enough to make any angel go stir-crazy.\u201d</p><p>Shirley did a poor job of containing a smile. How well she understood her friends\u2019 frustrations. Most of her career had been spent working with humans. \u201cJust don\u2019t ever volunteer to work as a guardian then,\u201d she suggested. The stories she could tell!</p><p>\u201cCan you help us, Shirley?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>Her friends\u2019 faces were both tired and gloomy, and Shirley didn\u2019t know if she had any words of wisdom to offer them. \u201cI can try. Tell me what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Mercy and Goodness exchanged glances. \u201cYou go first,\u201d Goodness suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you about Leah\u2019s day. I\u2019ve spent most of my time observing her, and frankly, I haven\u2019t gained a lot of insight into her personality. She holds her pain deep inside herself, unwilling to give up even the smallest portion of it, as if it were something of value.\u201d</p> <p>Shirley thoughtfully mulled over this information. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it seems to me she must find joy before she finds peace.\u201d</p><p>Stubbornly Mercy folded her arms and frowned and her chest lifted with a gigantic sigh. \u201cGabriel didn\u2019t say anything about joy. All he mentioned was peace. Who exactly does he think I am, St. Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that was the problem with the other prayer ambassadors. They were looking for shortcuts as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right,\u201d Mercy said ungraciously. \u201cBut how am I supposed to teach her about joy? Joy, peace, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are Leah\u2019s favorite things?\u201d</p><p>Mercy frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell. She enjoys her home, but she\u2019d gladly relinquish it for the chance to be a mother. While she was with her friend this afternoon, they talked quite a bit about Pam\u2019s kids. A spark shone from Leah as they discussed the children, especially her friend\u2019s three-year-old. I think she said his name was Scotty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren,\u201d Shirley repeated, her thoughts deep and grave.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the crux of the problem, don\u2019t you see,\u201d Mercy said, and the expression in her eyes changed, becoming more intent. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a child so she holds fast to her disappointment. The child will bring her the true joy, and I doubt that anything else will.\u201d</p><p>Goodness had grown especially quiet. \u201cWhat if you brought a child into her life for a short time, like a weekend or something? You could manage that, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d But Mercy didn\u2019t sound overly enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cIf she had a taste of deep inner happiness, she might be willing to release a portion of her pain,\u201d Goodness added. \u201cIt seems to me what Shirley\u2019s saying is that what Leah really needs isn\u2019t an absence of sorrow, or a feeling of gladness. Earthly joy wouldn\u2019t accomplish your purpose. Leah needs a connection with heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Shirley shouted with her excitement. She couldn\u2019t have said it better herself. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d Mercy said slowly, thoughtfully, \u201cif Leah would be willing to take hold of a . . . higher level of joy, then she might be willing to release her disappointments and frustrations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Shirley said and Goodness echoed, \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Shirley realized they made it sound simple, but she didn\u2019t envy Mercy her task. It was little wonder so many other prayer ambassadors had been defeated by Leah\u2019s problem.</p><p>Mercy stood and was pacing in front of the huge church organ, sending longing looks toward the antique instrument. \u201cAnyone have any other suggestions how I\u2019m supposed to accomplish this?\u201d</p><p>Shirley was silent and so was Goodness.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll think of something,\u201d she offered brightly. \u201cI always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you what\u2019s going on with Monica,\u201d Goodness said next, looping her legs over the arm of the chair and tilting her head back with a dramatic flair. She sighed and placed the back of her hand against her brow. \u201cShe\u2019s enthralled with this . . . this private investigator. The choir director might as well not exist, and Michael\u2019s perfect for her, just perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Chet?\u201d Mercy asked. \u201cHe might not be as bad as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not for Monica,\u201d Goodness said firmly, brooking no argument. \u201cI was able to check into his past and believe me, it isn\u2019t a pretty picture. He\u2019s lied, he\u2019s stolen and been in trouble with the law, although he once worked for them. He\u2019s not exactly what I\u2019d call an upstanding prospective husband for a minister\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Mercy mumbled.</p><p>Shirley mulled over the situation, tapping her fingers against the top of the railing, her thoughts moving in several different directions at once.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d Goodness added seriously, \u201che\u2019s egotistical, chauvinistic, and he hasn\u2019t darkened the door of a church in more than ten years. The last time he prayed he was in his early teens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t sound like the man for Monica,\u201d Mercy agreed.</p><p>Shirley hesitated, then decided she might as well speak her mind. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be so hasty here. Isn\u2019t your mission to teach Monica to be more flexible and accepting of others? From what I understand she\u2019s caught in a trap of following a list of rules and regulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but any lessons I have to teach her don\u2019t include Chet.\u201d</p><p>Shirley wasn\u2019t convinced of that. \u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told me, she views everything as black and white, with little room for compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Goodness was willing to admit, \u201cbut don\u2019t you see? The two are completely incompatible. Gabriel wanted me to get her feet wet, not throw her off the Freemont Bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I can suggest is that you be patient with Monica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing\u2019s in my favor,\u201d Goodness said, sounding encouraged. \u201cThey aren\u2019t likely to meet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing to worry about,\u201d Mercy said, slipping onto the bench in front of the massive organ.</p><p>\u201cMercy,\u201d Shirley warned, knowing her friend well enough to recognize the movement was anything but casual. The organ was too big a challenge to ignore.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Mercy reassured her, \u201cI\u2019m going to be good.\u201d</p><p>Shirley wasn\u2019t the least bit convinced, and she was right. As she winged her way out of the church and back to her charge, a blast of organ music crescendoed into the night. Groaning aloud, Shirley recognized the opening bars from Phantom of the Opera and knew exactly where they\u2019d come from.</p><p>\u201cDinner was lovely,\u201d Jody said, slipping out of the rich velvet booth in the luxurious downtown restaurant. Glen had been a wonderful dinner companion. Although Jody had been nervous when he\u2019d come to pick her up at the house, he\u2019d quickly put her at ease.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d Glen was saying as he helped her with her full-length wool coat. \u201cI can take you back to the house, if you want, but I was hoping you\u2019d consider taking a ferry ride with me.\u201d</p><p>It had been a year or more since Jody had last been on any of the Washington State ferries. After she\u2019d received the word of Jeff\u2019s death, she\u2019d come down to the waterfront often. She found a peace, a solace here that escaped her otherwise. On more than one occasion she\u2019d whiled away an hour or more riding the ferry, standing on the deck facing the wind, letting it batter her. She\u2019d close her eyes and pretend Jeff was with her. She\u2019d breathe in the scent of sea and salt while the birds screeched overhead. Each time she came away rejuvenated.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d she asked, reluctant for reasons she didn\u2019t care to explain. The ferry ride had been her own private haven, and she wasn\u2019t entirely sure she wanted to share this.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere you like. The Bainbridge run is a half hour each way. We could get a caff\u00e9 latte and look at the city lights. The Bremerton run is an hour each way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jody surprised herself by saying. It was easy to be with Glen. He was friendly and undemanding, allowing her to set the course of their evening, deciding even if there was to be a relationship. Jody found the lack of pressure necessary and reassuring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kept his hand at her elbow as they walked along the waterfront. The scent of Puget Sound mingled with that of fried fish from the takeout booths in the crisp night air. The cold nipped at Jody\u2019s cheeks and she buried her hands deep within the silk lining of her coat pockets.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Glen said, wrapping the muffler her mother had knit for her around her face, covering her mouth and ears. \u201cI can\u2019t have you catching a chill.\u201d</p><p>How thoughtful he was, she noted. This was exactly the type of thing Jeff would have done. Jody forced all thoughts of her dead husband from her mind. It was time to let go, time to put the past behind her and look forward, not back.</p><p>Remember Lot\u2019s wife.</p> <p>Jody didn\u2019t know where the thought came from, it was as if someone had whispered it into her ear. Lot\u2019s wife? Why she would even think of the Biblical character was beyond her. All Jody could remember was that Lot\u2019s wife had turned into a pillar of salt when she fled Sodom and Gomorrah. Against the angel\u2019s command, she\u2019d stopped and looked back.</p><p>That was it, Jody realized with a sudden burst of insight. Instead of setting her course for the future, Lot\u2019s wife had looked back over the life that she\u2019d once had. In many ways Jody had been doing the same thing, and in the process she\u2019d become frozen, unable to move forward to whatever awaited her.</p><p>They arrived at the ferry terminal minutes before the ferry pulled away from the huge dock, headed toward Bainbridge Island. Holding hands and laughing, Jody and Glen raced through the terminal and onto the ferry, their steps echoing like ricocheting bullets in the stillness of the night.</p><p>While Jody found them a table in the small cafeteria section, Glen ordered their caff\u00e9 lattes. She was lucky enough to find a booth by the window. Surprisingly, there didn\u2019t seem to be many passengers. The majority of the commuters remained in their cars for the short crossing.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Glen said, slipping into the seat across from her and handing her the thick paper cup.</p> <p>Jody trained her gaze out of the window, watching the city lights grow smaller as the huge boat effortlessly glided its way across Puget Sound. She lowered her gaze to the hot drink cradled in her hands. The time had come for her to be forthright with Glen.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned the other night that you\u2019d learned I don\u2019t date much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the scuttlebutt,\u201d Glen agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a widow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that too, with a nine-year-old son. I was sorry to have missed meeting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimmy and my mother went to McDonald\u2019s for dinner. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll still be awake when we get back.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that he\u2019d probably give Glen the third degree, asking him about baseball and other sports. To be fair she should warn Glen about her son\u2019s inquisitiveness, but before she could he spoke again.</p> <p>\u201cNo one seems to know much more about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . generally don\u2019t combine my home life with business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Glen was quick to assure her. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather not talk about yourself, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m pressuring you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t,\u201d she said, touched by his gentleness and how hard he worked to please her. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair that I tell you about Jeff . . . he was my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want,\u201d he said and sipped from his coffee. As he did, Jody noticed what nice hands he had. Large, but gentle. They were the kind of hands that comforted a child, that shook on fair deals, and were rarely clenched in anger.</p><p>\u201cI met Jeff shortly after he graduated from college,\u201d Jody continued. \u201cI was going into my junior year and we fell deeply in love. We dated for several months and talked about marriage. The next thing I knew Jeff had sold his car so he could buy me an engagement ring.\u201d She paused as she remembered how she\u2019d wept with joy the night he\u2019d given it to her. For weeks afterward he took a bus to job interviews. \u201cTo make a long story short,\u201d she continued when she could, \u201che got a job with Boeing and shortly after that we were married. Timmy wasn\u2019t a planned pregnancy, but I\u2019ve thanked God for my son every night since I lost Jeff. I . . . I don\u2019t know what I would have done if it hadn\u2019t been for Timmy. He . . . he gave me a reason to live.\u201d</p><p>She paused, needing a moment to collect herself.</p><p>\u201cJeff\u2019s job entailed a lot of traveling. He was always very good about keeping in touch with me. Timmy was only ten months old when Jeff was sent on assignment to Berlin. We set a convenient time for him to phone me each day. When he didn\u2019t call one evening I knew immediately that something was dreadfully wrong. I tried his hotel room several times, but there wasn\u2019t any answer.\u201d</p> <p>Her voice wobbled and Glen reached for her hand.</p><p>\u201cA week passed with no word. Nothing. I was frantic and so was Jeff\u2019s mother. Together we traveled to Germany. We stayed there nearly a month, in an effort to learn what we could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he just disappeared into thin air?\u201d Glen asked as they pulled into Winslow, the dock on Bainbridge Island. The sound of the cars driving off the ferry was followed by those boarding. The activity in the cafeteria increased.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed that way. We did everything we could, pulled every string, made a nuisance of ourselves at the police station and the American embassy. The best we could figure then was that Jeff had gone for a walk along the Spree River, which was close to the hotel. There\u2019d been a string of muggings and beatings that year. The only scenario the authorities could give was that Jeff had been the victim of such a crime and either been thrown or had fallen into the river. I toured every hospital in the city. Gloria, Jeff\u2019s mother, did as well. She insisted Jeff was alive, and refused to give up hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI held on to the belief as well because the alternative didn\u2019t bear thinking about. Soon there was nowhere else for us to look, no one for us to see. We didn\u2019t have anywhere else to turn, and had no choice but to return to the States. Gloria lives on the East Coast and after I returned to Seattle, she continued to pressure the powers that be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she learn anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing . . . but I did.\u201d Those early months had been a living nightmare to Jody. \u201cAs much as I believed in Jeff\u2019s love for me and Timmy, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if this disappearance was planned. I know it sounds ridiculous now, but you have to understand my mental state at the time. I . . . had him investigated. If there was another woman in his life, I needed to know about her. I had to find out if this was some kind of cruel hoax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you learn?\u201d</p><p>Jody focused her gaze on the caff\u00e9 latte. \u201cVery little. The only remote possibility came from a background check and I discovered Jeff had been approached by a government agency, the CIA, I believe\u2014one of those\u2014while he was in college. He turned down the offer. My father had a good friend in government who did some discreet checking and they reported back that what I\u2019d found out was true. Jeff had been recruited, but declined, and that was the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy because I wasn\u2019t working at the time. Within a few months my finances were a nightmare. My parents helped me out as much as they could, but I didn\u2019t want to live off their generosity. I couldn\u2019t. Jeff had disappeared, but because there wasn\u2019t a body I couldn\u2019t collect his insurance or any of the other benefits that would normally be available to a widow. Somehow I managed to hold on for nine months, with the help of my family and a few good friends. Eventually I was forced into filing for a divorce in order to sell some property. That gave me income to return to school and live on until I could get a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never found a body?\u201d</p><p>Jody looked out the window, the night was inky and thick, and her heart felt more so. \u201cYes, eventually they did, but it took nearly three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, what happened?\u201d</p><p>A tingling sensation roved up and down her spine even now, after all this time. \u201cI . . . received word from the German police that they\u2019d found a body caught in the cable beneath a bridge. They believed it was Jeff. They needed me to provide dental X rays and claim the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have come as a terrible shock.\u201d</p><p>Jody managed a nod. \u201cIt was. As best the authorities could figure, Jeff was mugged, beaten, and knocked into the river and left for dead. The body was so badly decomposed that there wasn\u2019t any real way of telling us much more than that. The news came at a bad time. Timmy had the chicken pox and I don\u2019t think I could have borne returning to Germany. Those weeks in Berlin three years earlier had been the most painful of my life. I thought to ask Jeff\u2019s mother to go, but she was always a bit eccentric and after Jeff\u2019s death she became more so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe continually insisted Jeff was alive and was furious with me when I divorced him. Our relationship was strained afterwards. She claimed she\u2019d talked to spirits in a s\u00e9ance, and Jeff had sent a message to her. He wanted Gloria to tell me how terribly disappointed he was in me because I\u2019d divorced him. I didn\u2019t talk to her much after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe insisted he was alive and that she\u2019d been able to talk to him in a s\u00e9ance? It sounds like she had a rough time of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has. I don\u2019t know that she\u2019ll ever fully recover.\u201d Then again, Jody didn\u2019t know if she would either. \u201cMy father, bless his heart, volunteered to make the trip. The dental X rays matched and that\u2019s the end of it. That was nearly five years ago now. Jeff\u2019s been gone a total of eight years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jody, I really am. Jeff must have loved you and Timmy very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he did. I get angry with myself that I doubted him even for that little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone would have.\u201d Glen took their empty cups and deposited them in the garbage. He slipped into the seat and seemed unnaturally quiet. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to understand the grief you experienced, but I was in a relationship that lasted for three years. Breaking it off was one of the most emotionally difficult times of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you think I was prying if I asked you what went wrong?\u201d</p><p>His mouth moved into a half smile. \u201cNot at all. You were frank with me and deserve the same consideration. I loved Maryann and wanted to marry her, but she\u2019s a successful attorney and, well, I\u2019ll simplify it by explaining that her career is more important to her than marriage. Somehow or another we got involved in a game of ultimatums. I wanted a wife and children. Maryann claimed she wasn\u2019t ready for either. In the end she suggested a compromise. She thought it was a good idea for us to move in together. I wasn\u2019t willing to fall into that trap, and that was more or less the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still love her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Glen lowered his gaze. \u201cI think it\u2019s very much like you and Jeff, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop loving her. It\u2019s been several months now and nothing\u2019s going to change. I\u2019ve accepted that and apparently so has she. We still bump into each other in court occasionally, and it\u2019s awkward, but there\u2019s nothing left for either of us to say.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t bother you that I have a child?\u201d</p><p>Glen straightened in his seat. \u201cBother me? I consider your son a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that until you meet him. He\u2019s quite a character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to doing exactly that.\u201d</p> <p>They were nearing the Seattle dock and Glen stood, eager for them to be on their way. He glanced at the gold watch on his wrist. \u201cYou think Timmy might still be awake?\u201d</p><p>Jody laughed and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it. He\u2019s anxious to meet you too and please don\u2019t hold it against me if he asks you a lot of personal questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Timmy like sports?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves them. According to his coach, he\u2019s going to be a dynamite pitcher someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Glen actually beamed. \u201cI was the pitcher for our high school team.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were?\u201d This was like a match made in heaven. Almost too good to be true. \u201cIf you mention that to my son, he\u2019ll be your friend for life.\u201d</p><p>Their pace was fast as they headed toward the car. Glen\u2019s hand was at Jody\u2019s elbow and although they were walking up a steep hill, it didn\u2019t seem to thwart their enthusiasm.</p><p>As Jody suspected, Timmy was dressed in his pajamas waiting for her return. The instant he heard the front door open, he raced from the family room like pistons firing awake an engine. He stopped abruptly in front of Glen and threw back his head to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cHow tall are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix-two. Is that tall enough?\u201d Glen asked, crouching down so that they met eye to eye.</p><p>\u201cThat depends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTimmy, where are your manners?\u201d Jody reminded her son.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to check him out, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me introduce you before you bombard him with questions,\u201d she said.</p><p>Timmy held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Timothy Jeffery Potter.\u201d</p><p>Glen stuck out his much larger hand. \u201cGlen Francis Richardson, but don\u2019t tell anyone my middle name\u2019s Francis, all right?\u201d The two exchanged enthusiastic handshakes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d Timmy spit on his two fingers and crossed his heart. \u201cI promise and you can zap me with a laser gun if you find out that I have.\u201d</p><p>Just then Helen Chandler came out of the family room, which was situated off the kitchen, and Jody made the introductions. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m heading home. My favorite television program\u2019s about to start and I don\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you to the door,\u201d Jody said. She needn\u2019t have worried about Glen. Timmy led him back into the family room, insisting that he show Glen his baseball card collection. At this rate her dinner date would be there for hours.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d her mother whispered loud enough to be heard into the next county and certainly the family room.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Jody said, opening the door. She didn\u2019t want to stand in the doorway and carry on a conversation when it was likely Glen could hear every word they were saying.</p><p>\u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you?\u201d Helen pressed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her mother threw back her head and shocked Jody out of five years of her life by shouting, \u201cHallelujah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Timmy called from the other room. \u201cAre you coming? Did you know Glen has a signed Ken Griffey, Jr. baseball card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Jody said, grateful to her son for the convenient excuse. This was neither the time nor the place for this intimate conversation with her mother. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll call you after church tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Timmy shouted again, \u201ccan Glen go to church with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d Jody glanced from her mother to the other room, not knowing which way to turn.</p><p>\u201cGo and talk to Glen and Timmy. We can chat later.\u201d Before Jody could turn away, her mother impulsively reached for her and hugged her. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be just fine. I can feel it. I\u2019ve waited a good long time for this,\u201d she said and kissed Jody on the cheek with a loud smack.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Timmy raced into the room and grabbed her by the hand, dragging her into the other room. \u201cIf Glen comes to church with us, you\u2019ll cook breakfast for him, won\u2019t you? Make something really good, though, okay, because I told him you\u2019re a really fabulous cook.\u201d He lowered his voice substantially, to a soft whisper. \u201cJust don\u2019t serve that liver sausage stuff you did at Christmas, it was yucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Jody said, walking into the room. It amazed her how easily Timmy had accepted Glen. Her eyes met Glen\u2019s and he smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself quite a son, Jody. He\u2019s everything you said and more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Glen, too,\u201d Timmy announced. \u201cI bet he\u2019d make me a great dad.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up bright and early,\u201d Lloyd Fischer said when Monica came down the stairs early Sunday morning. It was still pitch dark and although Monica had tried countless times, she hadn\u2019t been able to get back to sleep. Every time she closed her eyes, Chet Costello drifted, unbidden and unwelcome, into her thoughts, planting himself in her mind and refusing to go away.</p><p>If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Monica was scheduled to sing with the choir that afternoon in downtown Seattle. She\u2019d be near the Westlake Mall where she\u2019d first met Chet. The tantalizing threat of bumping into him a third time had plagued her like an overdue mortgage payment.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Monica mumbled, helping herself to a cup of coffee. She kept her back to her father, letting him know she wasn\u2019t interested in conversation. She didn\u2019t mean to be rude, but she didn\u2019t feel up to her usual cheerful chatter.</p><p>Her father generally woke around four on Sunday mornings, enthusiastic and eager to review his sermon and make any last-minute changes. He was the first one at the church, turning on the furnace so the building would be warm when the congregation arrived. He was a gentle spirit, her father, a man who brought joy to God\u2019s heart. His tendency to look at the bright side of an issue was often a source of contention between them, but it was a minor fault.</p><p>One of them had to maintain a realistic outlook on life and it was the role she\u2019d chosen. Because of this, others tended to view her in a less than favorable light. Her father, on the other hand, was loved by all. He was a good shepherd to his flock, sensitive and gentle, steering them toward a deeper understanding of God\u2019s word.</p><p>Monica sluggishly stirred a teaspoon of sugar into the coffee. She wasn\u2019t looking forward to the outing with the choir, and had toyed with the idea of digging up a plausible excuse not to go. Knowing it would have caused a hardship for the others was her only hesitation.</p><p>No, she corrected, striving for honesty, that wasn\u2019t entirely true.</p><p>Some small, dark part of herself hungered to see Chet again. It pained and troubled her to admit that. The man had taken advantage of her, threatened her, and then, against her will, had blatantly kissed her. The mere thought of their last encounter brought a flash of heated color to her cheeks.</p><p>It mortified her to recall the way she\u2019d responded to him, the way she encouraged his advance, the way her body had reacted to his. No decent woman would feel the things she had, Monica was convinced of that. Patrick had kissed her several times early on in their relationship, and what she\u2019d experienced with him had been a small spark of tenderness. When Chet had kissed her, she\u2019d felt as if she were standing in the middle of a forest fire.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d her father asked, studying her closely as she sat down at the kitchen table across from him.</p><p>Now was the perfect time to say she wasn\u2019t up to par. That was all she need do. Her father would be the one to suggest she not participate in the choir\u2019s performance that afternoon. Naturally she\u2019d put up a token fuss, but he\u2019d be adamant, insisting her health was more important, and the choir could make do without her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Dad,\u201d she murmured. She braced her elbows against the edge of the table and sipped from the thick ceramic cup, wondering what it was about Chet that caused her to be so weak willed. It was unlikely that she would run into him, although, as luck would have it\u2014not that she believed in such matters\u2014she\u2019d encountered Chet twice now within the same week.</p><p>Her father left and returned to the kitchen a moment later, dressed in his thick winter coat. He wrapped a wool scarf around his neck, slipped his hands into leather gloves, and announced, \u201cI\u2019m going over to the church.\u201d</p><p>She acknowledged him with a nod, grateful she\u2019d be alone for the next several minutes. Instead of worrying about the possibility of seeing Chet, she should be praying for him. The man was clearly in need of divine intervention. One look at him told her everything she needed to know about his shabby life and immoral habits. Their all-too-brief conversations had reinforced her suspicions. He was cynical, irrational, stubborn, and only heaven knew what else.</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t he leave me alone?\u201d she asked out loud, surprising herself with the shrill sound of her own voice.</p><p>She leaped from her chair and paced the compact kitchen. Absorbed in her thoughts, Monica continued walking about the room, circling the wooden table a number of times. She\u2019d prayed long and hard for God to send a man into her life, but she hadn\u2019t asked how she was supposed to recognize him.</p><p>How she wished her mother were alive. Esther Fischer had always seemed to know what to do even in the most awkward of situations.</p><p>Her father looked surprised to see her when he returned fifteen minutes later. His nose was red and his cheeks bright with color from the short walk from the church to the parsonage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful morning,\u201d he announced cheerfully, removing his gloves, one finger at a time.</p><p>It could be blizzard conditions and her father would say the same thing. Sundays were beautiful to him no matter what the weather, because he was leading his flock in worship.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Monica said, walking over to the refrigerator and taking out a carton of eggs and a package of bacon. She set them on the counter and then purposely turned around to face him. \u201cWhen you met Mom, how did you feel? I mean did you have an inkling that this was the woman you\u2019d eventually love and marry?\u201d</p><p>If her father thought her question was out of the ordinary, he gave no indication. \u201cI saw your mother for the first time in church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She loved the story of how her parents had met while in the college-age Sunday school class. Her mother\u2019s family had recently moved into the area and Esther had felt shy and awkward that first Sunday.</p><p>Her father had been captivated by the beautiful young woman and had wanted to claim the empty seat beside her. Unfortunately several of the other young men had shared the same idea. While they were arguing about it, Esther had quietly stood and moved over to the chair and sat next to Lloyd. It wasn\u2019t a wildly romantic story, but Monica had enjoyed hearing it again and again as a young girl. It had deeply impressed her that her mother, although she was only nineteen at the time, had the presence of mind to choose such a wonderful man as Monica\u2019s father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Monica doubted that she had such finely tuned discrimination herself, and after meeting Chet she was convinced of it.</p><p>\u201cDid I know that first Sunday I was going to love your mother?\u201d her father repeated her question slowly, his look thoughtful. \u201cIt\u2019s funny you should ask about her. I was just thinking about her myself and how she loved cold, crisp mornings such as this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon after you met did you realize you were going to love her?\u201d Monica pressed, anxious now.</p><p>Her father poured himself a fresh cup of coffee. \u201cIt would sound romantic if I said I did that first Sunday, wouldn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was attracted to Esther from the moment I laid eyes on her. Any young man with a lick of sense would have been. She was lovely then and more so as the years progressed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou dated for several years, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, those were difficult times. We weren\u2019t married until four years later, after I\u2019d completed seminary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. What I want to know is when you realized you were in love with her.\u201d</p><p>He sat down at the table and rubbed his hand over his face.</p><p>Monica laughed. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be this hard, Daddy.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, his dark eyes intense. \u201cI was trying to think back and it\u2019s been more years than I care to count. As best as I can remember, falling in love was a gradual process for me. Your mother and I saw a good deal of one another and I always enjoyed her company. It just seemed to me that she\u2019d make a good pastor\u2019s wife and so I asked her to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Monica didn\u2019t bother to hide her disappointment. She\u2019d been looking for something that hadn\u2019t been there. Her parents, while deeply in love, hadn\u2019t shared any great passion for each other. To the best of her memory she couldn\u2019t remember them doing more than holding hands in public.</p><p>Her disappointment must have shown because her father looked at her and asked, \u201cThis troubles you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I . . . I was just wondering, is all. It isn\u2019t important.\u201d Only it was.</p><p>Even when they were young and in love her parents had been sensible and prudent when it came to choosing their life\u2019s partners. There hadn\u2019t been any explosion of\u2014she hated to even say the word\u2014passion between them. They\u2019d drifted into marriage as a natural conclusion to a long-standing relationship.</p><p>It was the way her romance had started with Patrick, but their relationship had fizzled out and died without Monica even realizing what had happened. What she\u2019d hoped to hear had been a confirmation of the feelings she\u2019d experienced since meeting Chet. Not that she\u2019d ever consider marrying anyone like him.</p> <p>\u201cI deeply loved your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re impatient to be a wife yourself, and all I can say is that God will bring a man into your life in His own time.\u201d</p><p>Monica nodded and, returning to the stove, placed an iron skillet on the stove. \u201cI\u2019m in no rush,\u201d she said, and even as she spoke, Monica knew that wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cRemember what happened when Sarah decided to take matters into her own hands by giving Abraham her servant girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make this a do-it-yourself project.\u201d</p><p>Monica laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Her father was silent for a moment, then asked, \u201cMichael\u2019s certainly a nice-looking young man, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Monica resisted the urge to laugh outright. Her father couldn\u2019t have been less subtle. The choir director was a couple of years younger than Monica, not that it mattered. He was reserved and quiet, and frankly, she couldn\u2019t imagine spending the rest of her life with him. She liked Michael, and appreciated his efforts with the choir, but when she looked at him there wasn\u2019t any spark, any sizzling attraction. She felt nothing.</p><p>How she wished she could say the same for Chet. What she felt for him had to be immoral. It was immoral. Only that morning, when she was trying desperately to sleep, her thoughts had been full of Chet and the kiss they\u2019d shared. The mere memory had turned her body into a traitor. Monica was convinced those feelings were ones godly women were never meant to experience.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d her father continued, blithely unaware of the route her unruly thoughts had taken. \u201cMichael would make you a good husband. I\u2019m an old man, and I don\u2019t know much about romance, but my guess is that he\u2019d very much like to get to know you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d Monica agreed, unwilling to say anything more.</p><p>\u201cYou could do far worse.\u201d</p><p>Her father hadn\u2019t a clue how true those words were. He approved of Michael, but she had no doubts of what the good reverend would think should she introduce him to Chet. Monica could well imagine the look of alarm that would come into his eyes. Naturally, he\u2019d be gentle with his concern, but his response would be impossible to conceal.</p><p>After she\u2019d finished frying the bacon and eggs, Monica set the plate on the table and said, \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to change.\u201d</p><p>Her father tossed a surprised look her way. \u201cYou\u2019re not eating?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>At the moment Monica wasn\u2019t sure of anything.</p><p>\u201cCome sit with me,\u201d Andrew invited. Leah\u2019s husband was relaxing on the white leather sofa, his feet stretched out and propped against the end of the glass coffee table. He set aside the morning paper and held out his arms coaxingly to her.</p><p>\u201cI was going to wash the breakfast dishes,\u201d Leah said, and hesitated.</p><p>\u201cDo them later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew!\u201d Her husband had the look about him that was unmistakable. He wanted her the way a man wants his wife and he wasn\u2019t willing to wait much longer.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked, poising her hand against her hip and shifting her weight to one foot. \u201cIt\u2019s barely ten o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d She didn\u2019t know why she was making excuses, she was as eager for him as he was for her. This was a good time of the month as well, her temperature would confirm that, but she hadn\u2019t taken it yet that morning.</p><p>\u201cSo? Who cares about the time?\u201d he asked, holding his arm out to her. \u201cDoes the clock have to chime a certain number of times before I\u2019m allowed to make love to my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She walked toward him, her steps slow and provocative. When she was close, Andrew gripped hold of her waist, and gently lowered her onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you how beautiful you are lately?\u201d</p><p>Leah smiled and shook her head. \u201cNot since yesterday morning.\u201d</p><p>His hands stroked the length of her arms, his touch light and gentle. \u201cThen I need to make up for lost time, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all that\u2019s right, you should do penance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>She looped her arms around his neck and pressed her forehead to his. Andrew\u2019s hands were busily working open the fastenings of her robe. After ten years of married life, Leah\u2019s body was well acquainted with that of her husband\u2019s.</p><p>Their kiss was slow, sultry, and thorough. She was breathless and panting by the time Andrew dragged his mouth from hers.</p><p>\u201cYou taste good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d she whispered, her eyes closed.</p><p>His hands left her breasts and eased aside the elastic of the silk bottoms of her pajamas to stroke her flat stomach sensuously.</p><p>Andrew groaned as she moved against him, and kissed her again and then again, each one growing more intense in length and need.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want?\u201d he whispered hoarsely close to her ear, panting.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He kissed her neck and his hands sought her breasts. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife, I can make love to you any place I please, can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should take my temperature first. This might not be the best time of the month for us to be doing this. If we\u2019re going to make love let\u2019s do it when there\u2019s a chance I could get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed her words was filled with tension. Leah didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d said that was so terrible. Their lovemaking had always been arranged according to her menstrual cycle and her temperature, which signaled ovulation.</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d she asked, not understanding.</p><p>He moved away from her and straightened his clothes. She noticed that his hands were shaking. The anger came off him in waves like heat shimmering off concrete in the hottest days of summer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll only take a moment,\u201d she promised.</p><p>He kept his back to her. Still not understanding what she\u2019d said, Monica sat up herself and straightened her own pajamas.</p><p>\u201cIt . . . it only makes sense if we\u2019re going to make love to do it at a time when I could get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>At her words, Andrew vaulted off the sofa and stormed into their bedroom. It was rare for him to act this way and she instinctively followed, wanting to right the wrong.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201d she asked softly, placing her hand on his arm.</p><p>He whirled on her then, eyes flashing with anger, his teeth clenched. \u201cNo, Leah, I don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>The force of his anger took her by surprise and she gasped and automatically stepped away from him. She couldn\u2019t remember him ever looking at her this way.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I assumed you want a baby too,\u201d she offered weakly.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d The words were hurled at her like sharp knives. \u201cBut not at the expense of everything else. It might come as a shock to you, but I\u2019d appreciate being treated more like a husband and less like a robot. Every time we make love, all you can think about is making a baby. Did you ever stop to consider why we make love less and less often? Have you?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Leah had backed all the way across the room. Her backside was flattened against the wall. \u201cI . . . I didn\u2019t notice we made love less often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last seven years it\u2019s been sex on demand. Our entire love life is centered on what time of the month it is. If Mars is lined up with Jupiter or some such stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said, wanting to defend herself.</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly. We make love when you want, when you think there\u2019s a remote possibility you might become pregnant. It isn\u2019t love any longer, it\u2019s sex, and if that was all I wanted, I could get it on the street.\u201d</p><p>Leah felt the color drain from her face. \u201cYou . . . you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d It was a fear she\u2019d lived with from the moment she realized she might never bear a child, that Andrew would eventually leave her. That he\u2019d find another woman who could give him the family he wanted.</p><p>He tore out of his pajamas, dressing quickly. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time we made love,\u201d he said, jerking a shirt from the closet. The hanger swung with the force of his action. \u201cReally made love,\u201d he amended. \u201cIt isn\u2019t me you want, it\u2019s what I can give you, and if I can\u2019t, then I\u2019m no use to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andrew didn\u2019t answer. He yanked on a pair of pants, then sat on the end of the mattress to pull on his socks and shoes. His shirt wasn\u2019t buttoned as he stalked past her, toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Leah asked, running after him. Tears blurred her eyes and it was difficult to speak normally.</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew,\u201d she cried, \u201cplease wait.\u201d</p> <p>His hand was on the door, his back to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry, so sorry. Please.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders rose and then relaxed. For the longest time he didn\u2019t move. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure he was breathing\u2014she knew she wasn\u2019t. The only sound in the room was her soft whimper as she struggled not to weep.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be gone long,\u201d he said, opening the door and walking out.</p><p>Leah flinched when the door closed, the sound exploding in the otherwise quiet room. She pressed a hand to her flat stomach and for a moment she thought she was going to be physically sick.</p> <p>How long she stood there, paralyzed with pain, she didn\u2019t know. She couldn\u2019t guess. After a while she turned and headed for their bedroom. Slumping onto the edge of her mattress, she opened the drawer of her night stand and reached for the temperature chart she faithfully kept. Staring at them, her eyes filled with tears. After a moment, she walked into the kitchen. Her feet felt heavy and made small scuffing sounds against the floor as she listlessly made her way across the other room.</p><p>She opened the garbage compactor and tossed it inside. Along with the spiral pad, Leah felt as if she were throwing away her dreams.</p><p>It took her a moment to compose herself before she drew in a deep, stabilizing breath and reached for a dirty plate from their breakfast. She rinsed it off and blindly stacked it into the dishwasher.</p><p>Chet wasn\u2019t anywhere in the audience, at least not where Monica could see him. Relief swept through her as she looked out over the crowd of Christmas shoppers from her stance on the top riser. She hadn\u2019t approved of this Sunday afternoon outing. To her way of thinking a performance on Sunday wasn\u2019t proper for Christians. The way she interpreted the Bible, the Sabbath was a day of rest. Those who opted to spend their time shopping were breaking the observance of the Lord\u2019s day. She\u2019d tried to reason with her father and Michael when they\u2019d first planned this performance weeks earlier, but her objection had been overridden. Her father had claimed their singing was a way of spreading the message of love and joy. As usual, Monica had no argument.</p><p>Now she was pleased it had been overridden because it gave her an opportunity to see Chet again\u2014if she did. It didn\u2019t feel good to admit that, but Monica was tired of fooling herself. She needed to see him again, just once more, to banish him from her mind, to prove there could never be anything between them.</p><p>The performance went well, although Monica was preoccupied searching the sea of faces for Chet\u2019s. No doubt he was entertaining himself in the Blue Goose, the bar he chose to frequent. It would serve him right if she walked right in there and demanded to talk to him. She could embarrass him the way he had her.</p> <p>Sneaking away from the others, however, proved to be more difficult than she anticipated.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d Michael asked her. He was tall and so thin the first thing she thought of whenever they met was that someone should feed him.</p><p>Monica looked up at him, her mind a blank. She hadn\u2019t been listening to the conversation and hadn\u2019t a clue what he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cTo Sherry\u2019s,\u201d he elaborated when she didn\u2019t respond right away. \u201cShe\u2019s invited the ensemble over for hot cider and cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Her gaze darted to the Blue Goose. \u201cI have an errand to run first, but I\u2019ll be there shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn errand,\u201d Michael repeated. \u201cDowntown?\u201d</p><p>She said in a no-nonsense tone, grateful he didn\u2019t quiz her about what she was doing, especially in light of her earlier protests about abusing the Lord\u2019s day. \u201cI won\u2019t be long . . . you go on ahead with the others. I\u2019ll be at Sherry\u2019s within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you aren\u2019t going back with everyone else?\u201d</p> <p>The man seemed to have a comprehension problem. \u201cYes,\u201d she said forcefully. \u201cI already explained I have an errand I need to run.\u201d Then feeling mildly guilty for the outburst, she added, \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should wait for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly. She could well imagine what the others would think if they saw her walking into a tavern. \u201cI appreciate the offer, but that isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>Michael looked as if he weren\u2019t sure what he should do, which only served to irritate her further. \u201cPerhaps I should stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael, please, that isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d The man seemed intent on thwarting her, which aggravated her so much she was barely civil. \u201cI\u2019ll see you within the hour.\u201d Not waiting for any further arguments, she turned and abruptly walked across the street to the Westlake Mall.</p><p>The crowds were thick and the moment she was free to leave, she escaped the shopping mall and hurried across the street. Making certain none of the other choir members had lingered, she walked purposefully toward the Blue Goose.</p><p>Her hand was on the door when she realized what she was doing. She was willing to walk into an establishment that practiced iniquity in the lowest form, in order to locate Chet. A man who plagued her thoughts from the moment they\u2019d met. Something was dreadfully wrong with her.</p><p>She turned, practically running in her eagerness to escape, stopping only when she came to the street. She felt someone move behind her.</p><p>\u201cI thought as much. You were looking for me, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>There could be no mistaking the voice. It belonged to Chet Costello.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>It must have taken Jody forty-five minutes to persuade Timmy to go to bed, and then only after Glen agreed to help her tuck him in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired,\u201d Timmy insisted as Jody pulled back the sheets of his twin bed. \u201cI want to talk to Glen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Jody knew the instant the words escaped her lips that she\u2019d walked right into that with both feet.</p><p>\u201cAll kinds of stuff. I need to know what kind of dad he\u2019s going to be. After all, God sent him, didn\u2019t He?\u201d</p><p>A gigantic hole for her to fall in would have been welcome just then. Her son had a knack of knowing exactly what to say that would embarrass her the most. \u201cTimmy, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really need to be tucked in,\u201d Timmy told Glen, sounding mature for his years. \u201cI just wanted to show you my stuff.\u201d Something that he\u2019d spent every available moment doing since Glen had arrived. Timmy had dragged out his baseball mitt and bat and his beloved baseball card collection for Glen to inspect. The poor man hadn\u2019t had a moment\u2019s peace in over an hour.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Tim,\u201d Jody said sternly, standing in the doorway, her hand on the light switch.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Night, Mom. \u2019Night, Glen.\u201d</p><p>Jody felt as though her cheeks were red enough to guide ships lost in the fog. She barely knew Glen and already her son was announcing what a great father he\u2019d make. There was no help for it, she was forced to explain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you that coffee now,\u201d she said, leading the way into the compact kitchen and reaching for a mug. Her back ached from holding it so straight and stiff. She didn\u2019t know how she could possibly explain. \u201cI apologize for what Timmy said earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, about you making him a great father. He\u2019s at the age now where he misses a man in his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine his friends talk about their dads.\u201d</p><p>Jody nodded. \u201cRecently Timmy wrote a letter in school to God asking for a father. Apparently he looks at you as the answer to his prayer because . . . well, because you\u2019re the first man I\u2019ve dated in a long while and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains the comment about God sending me,\u201d Glen said as he carried the two steaming coffee mugs to the table.</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Jody reluctantly admitted that much. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to feel pressure because of what he\u2019d said and I certainly didn\u2019t want you to think that . . . that I\u2019d put him up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Glen sat down and crossed his legs, relaxing against the chair. He appeared more amused than concerned. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful boy. You\u2019ve done a good job raising him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His words made her proud, but at the same time she realized that she\u2019d failed her son in some way, otherwise she would have recognized his need for a man in his life. Her father had served that purpose for Timmy until his death and the void had been deeply felt by her young son.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored that Timmy thinks I\u2019m good father material,\u201d Glen added between sips of coffee.</p><p>\u201cIt helped that you had a signed Ken Griffey, Jr. baseball card,\u201d Jody teased, then grew serious. \u201cI thought I should explain why Timmy\u2019s so eager for us to get to know each other better.\u201d</p><p>The lines that fanned out from Glen\u2019s eyes relaxed as he set aside his mug and reached for her hand. \u201cI\u2019m just as eager to know you and Timmy better, but I\u2019m an adult and it wouldn\u2019t be considered cool to let it show. I realize we\u2019ve only been acquainted a short while, and it\u2019s much too soon to be thinking along the lines Timmy is, but . . .\u201d He hesitated and his eyes studied hers, his look intense. He seemed to be weighing his words carefully, then shrugged and added, \u201cOh, what the hell, you can think what you want, but I like you, Jody, I like you a lot, and I think Timmy\u2019s a great kid. I haven\u2019t made it a secret that I\u2019m strongly attracted to you.</p><p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned the fact that you have a son who\u2019s looking for a father is an added bonus. I want a family, and have for some time. I\u2019d be pleased if we both started thinking along those lines.</p><p>\u201cThere, I\u2019ve said it and I\u2019ve probably shocked you, but we\u2019re both mature adults, capable of handling the truth, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Jody didn\u2019t know what to say. She felt overwhelmed and apprehensive. She stood abruptly, nearly toppling her chair in her haste. \u201cI\u2019m flattered, really flattered, but . . . it\u2019s too soon, much too soon for us to be thinking along those lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Glen agreed patiently. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jody, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you. You\u2019re right, of course, I got caught up in Timmy\u2019s enthusiasm. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive.\u201d</p><p>Glen hadn\u2019t done anything more than sample his coffee, but he stood and carried the mug to the sink. \u201cI should be going.\u201d</p><p>Jody nodded, but immediately felt guilty. Glen looked a little like Timmy after she\u2019d had to tell him no when it was something he really wanted.</p><p>\u201cWould you be willing to see me again, or have I completely terrified you?\u201d he asked when he reached the front door.</p><p>Jody couldn\u2019t see how she could refuse. \u201cI\u2019d enjoy going out with you again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The defeated puppy-dog look was replaced with a wide smile. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call some time tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be fine.\u201d</p><p>Glen opened the door and paused. \u201cWould you be willing to see me if it weren\u2019t for Timmy?\u201d</p><p>Jody laughed softly. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p> <p>She was rewarded with another warm grin that lit up his eyes. He took a small step toward her and then stopped abruptly and exhaled a long, deep breath. \u201cI\u2019d very much like to kiss you, but I\u2019m afraid that might be pushing matters. We\u2019ll do this your way, Jody. I\u2019m a patient man, especially when the prize is one of such value. Good night and thank you for one of the most enjoyable evenings of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Night.\u201d She stood at the door and waited until he\u2019d reached his car. Once he pulled away, his headlights illuminating the dark street, Jody closed the door and leaned against the heavy wood.</p><p>Glen had nice eyes, she decided. The eyes of a man she could trust, who wouldn\u2019t rush her into something she wasn\u2019t ready for. The eyes of a man who was well acquainted with pain and disappointment himself.</p><p>After a few moments she walked over to the mantel in the family room where Jeff\u2019s picture rested. She stared at his familiar features, the features she loved so dearly. Even after all these years, he had the power to stir her.</p><p>Reaching out, she traced her fingers over the outline of his jaw, waiting for the swell of emotion that generally accompanied such moments. To her surprise none came. Not guilt. Nor doubt. Jeff smiled benignly out at her and perhaps it was her imagination, she was sure it must be, but he seemed to approve of Glen, approve of the job she\u2019d done raising Timmy. It seemed he was telling her that even in death he would always love her.</p> <p>Leah heard the door shut. Andrew had returned after being away most of the day. She closed her eyes, and took a moment to compose herself before she faced her husband. He was right and she knew it. Having a child had become an obsession with her, so much so that she was systematically destroying the most important relationship in her life.</p><p>Stepping out of the kitchen, she watched as Andrew sat down in front of the television and reached for the remote control.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I thought that must be you,\u201d she said, which sounded silly since it couldn\u2019t have been anyone else.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s me.\u201d His words were as stark and cold as they had been earlier. It wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d she asked, tentatively stepping into the room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything more to say.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that they were having this conversation with his back to her said far more than any words they might have spoken.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Andrew,\u201d she whispered, struggling not to break into tears. She hated any kind of discord between them. They\u2019d always been so close, she didn\u2019t think anything could destroy their love. She feared now that she might be wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already apologized, you don\u2019t need to do it again.\u201d The newsclips from the game between the Seattle Seahawks and the San Diego Chargers were playing and the noise of the game filled the room.</p><p>Leah, who was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, wiped her hands against her thighs. \u201cI was hoping we could talk,\u201d she said, lowering herself onto the far side of the sofa across from him.</p><p>\u201cLeah, listen,\u201d Andrew said sharply, \u201cI\u2019m not good company at the moment. If we\u2019re going to talk it should be when we\u2019re both in the right frame of mind.\u201d</p><p>She could never remember Andrew being like this. They rarely disagreed and when they did, both were eager to resolve their differences.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think you\u2019ll be in the right frame of mind?\u201d she asked, swallowing her pride.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just need some time to put my thoughts together. I probably shouldn\u2019t have come back to the house, but it\u2019s cold and I wasn\u2019t keen about spending the rest of the day and evening sitting in my car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you should have come back here. I\u2019m glad you did. Do you want me to get you a cup of coffee? Some dinner?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhat I\u2019d appreciate more than anything is some time to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, scooting off the leather sofa, \u201cwhatever you want. Take all the time you need. I was thinking of going out anyway.\u201d</p><p>He acknowledged her with an abrupt nod and continued to stare at the television screen. \u201cThat sounds like a good idea.\u201d</p><p>So he wanted her to leave, was willing for her to go. Leah hadn\u2019t realized how deeply she\u2019d injured Andrew\u2019s pride or how she\u2019d weakened the foundation of their marriage. It came as a painful shock.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything more to her when she left. Leah went about gathering her coat and purse as if she were going on an outing she\u2019d looked forward to for weeks. Humming softly she called out cheerfully, \u201cI won\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>Not knowing where to go, Leah drove around for an hour before heading toward Pam\u2019s house. Her college friend knew there was something wrong the minute she opened the door. Not that Leah would have been able to hide it.</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d Pam said, alarm filling her eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Unable to speak, Leah shook her head from side to side.</p><p>\u201cCome inside. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing a long talk and a strong cup of tea can\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>This was what Leah loved about Pam\u2014the ability to solve any problem with a cup of tea and a stiff upper lip. Now that she was here, she wasn\u2019t keen on talking. What she really needed was a friend, not a counselor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all that bad,\u201d Leah said, making light of her troubles as she followed Pam into the kitchen. The sink was stacked with dirty dishes and the cupboards were smeared with miniature fingerprints, a stark contrast to her own spotless kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Leah?\u201d Scotty raced into the kitchen, clutching his stuffed dinosaur, the one she\u2019d given him for his birthday a month earlier.</p><p>\u201cScotty, you\u2019re supposed to be asleep!\u201d Pam said, hands on her hips.</p><p>Leah scooped the three-year-old into her arms and hugged him close while he pressed happy kisses over her face. He was a sweet boy with deep blue eyes and a froth of unmanageable curls and Leah loved him as much as if he were her own.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my darling?\u201d she asked, setting him on the countertop and brushing the curls away from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d he said, proudly holding up his thumb.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dry,\u201d Pam explained. \u201cScotty has given up sucking his thumb, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>Scotty nodded eagerly and Leah carried him back into the bedroom he shared with his younger brother. Thirteen-month-old Jason was sound asleep, his knees tucked under his stomach, his small buttocks thrust into the air.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Scotty said in a loud whisper as Leah set him back in his bed, after maneuvering around a stack of plastic building blocks and several wooden puzzles. Pieces were scattered all about the area.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you for not sucking your thumb,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Scotty beamed with the praise. She kissed his forehead and tiptoed out of the room.</p><p>Pam had the tea brewed by the time Leah returned. \u201cWhere\u2019s Diane?\u201d she asked about her friend\u2019s oldest child.</p><p>\u201cDoug had to run an errand and she wanted to go with him. As you can see I haven\u2019t gotten around to the dinner dishes. Sit down and tell me what\u2019s upset you so much.\u201d</p><p>Leah didn\u2019t know where to start, or if she should. It wasn\u2019t easy to admit her failings. \u201cAndrew and I had a spat, is all. We both needed some time to think matters through so I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious, is it?\u201d</p><p>Leah shook her head, discounting her concern. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Pam brought the china teapot to the table. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe rarely squabble and it upsets me when we do.\u201d</p><p>A series of short horn blasts interrupted their conversation. Although the sound was irritating there seemed to be a certain rhythm to it. Leah closed her eyes and listened carefully. If she hadn\u2019t known better she\u2019d swear it sounded like someone was tapping out \u201cHit the Road, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Pam sent a curious look Leah\u2019s way. \u201cDoug must need my help,\u201d she said, \u201che\u2019s certainly being clever about getting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Hit the Road, Jack,\u2019 \u201d Pam finished for her, snapping her fingers as she walked toward the door. She stopped abruptly and turned around, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cIs it Doug?\u201d Leah asked.</p><p>Pam shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from your car.\u201d</p><p>This had to be some kind of joke. She set aside her tea and followed Pam. \u201cAre you telling me my car\u2019s making that weird sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your horn,\u201d Pam insisted. \u201cJust listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy horn!\u201d She joined her friend at the doorway.</p><p>\u201cThis is the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Leah laughed. \u201cI better find out what\u2019s going on here.\u201d She grabbed her car keys and hurried across the yard.</p><p>\u201cMercy, stop that right this minute.\u201d</p><p>Mercy whirled around to find Shirley hovering over the trunk of Leah\u2019s car, her hands braced against her hips. Knowing she\u2019d overstepped her authority, Mercy reluctantly complied. No doubt she\u2019d done it this time and the archangel had dispatched Shirley to send her home.</p><p>\u201cDid Gabriel send you?\u201d Mercy demanded defiantly. If she was going to crash, she was going down in flames.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m here to stop you before you get yourself into even bigger trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to do something fast,\u201d Mercy cried. \u201cAndrew\u2019s worried because he can\u2019t find Leah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Mercy should have known she\u2019d need to explain. \u201cLeah and Andrew argued this morning and now he feels terrible. He wants to talk to Leah but he doesn\u2019t know where she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not to get involved in any human\u2019s life,\u201d Shirley chastised. \u201cBy the way, what\u2019s with that ridiculous song?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was popular several years back, one Leah would recognize. I\u2019m trying to tell her to hightail it home.\u201d</p><p>Shirley folded her arms over her chest and impatiently tapped her foot. \u201cYou\u2019re courting trouble with this one. By heaven, Gabriel\u2019s going to be furious. Secular music, no less. You couldn\u2019t have come up with something more . . . spiritual?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Swing Low Sweet Chariot\u2019 just didn\u2019t hack it. I was desperate. It worked, didn\u2019t it? Look, Leah\u2019s leaving now and two to one she\u2019s headed home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re placing bets now too?\u201d Shirley said behind a smile. It wasn\u2019t unheard-of for a prayer ambassador on earth assignment to return home with a few minor bad habits. Some angels were known to have found gambling appealing.</p><p>\u201cAre you with the God Squad Police Patrol or something?\u201d Mercy blurted out impatiently. Shirley had the luxury of having everything falling neatly into place with her prayer assignment. The last she\u2019d heard, Timmy\u2019s mother had agreed to date a fine, upstanding young man who\u2019d make Timmy a great father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She and Goodness should have it so easy. As for herself, Mercy was batting zero when it came to helping Leah, and from what she heard, Goodness wasn\u2019t in much better shape. If anything, matters had gotten progressively worse. In the last report from Goodness, Mercy had learned that Monica Fischer had stretched the truth in an effort to seek out Chet Costello. For a woman who prided herself on rigid honesty this was not an encouraging sign.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound so bossy,\u201d Shirley explained, looking apologetic, \u201cbut Gabriel could have your wings for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wings! I don\u2019t think so.\u201d It would take a whole lot more than tapping out \u201cHit the Road, Jack\u201d on a car horn for that to happen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only trying to help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but . . .\u201d</p><p>A whoosh of warm wind accompanied Goodness, who arrived breathless and impatient, with her feathers ruffled with indignation. \u201cWhat is going on with you two?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cShirley decided to appoint herself as my guardian and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was watching out for your best interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! Both of you!\u201d Goodness cried, tossing her arms in the air. \u201cI had to leave Monica and Chet at the worst possible moment for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really, we were\u2014\u201d</p><p>Goodness cut her off by stamping her foot. \u201cShall we all get back to our jobs? Humans are trouble enough without the three of us squabbling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only looking to help,\u201d Shirley offered with an injured look.</p><p>When Leah pulled into her driveway, she wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. The business with her horn had ceased the moment she started the engine. Since Andrew took care of the maintenance on their vehicles it was something she should tell him. But how could she explain her horn going all weird on her?</p><p>The front door to the house opened even before she had a chance to climb out of the car. Andrew\u2019s large frame filled the doorway as he rushed out to meet her.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d he asked, his face tight with concern. \u201cI must have made a dozen phone calls and sounded like a complete idiot looking for my wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I drove over to Pam and Doug\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam and Doug,\u201d Andrew repeated and stabbed his fingers into his hair as if to punish himself. \u201cI should have tried them first\u2014it makes perfect sense, the way you love those kids,\u201d he said, steering her toward the house. He closed the door, shutting out the cold.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t ready to talk, remember?\u201d Leah said. \u201cYou were preoccupied with the sports news and needed time to sort through your feelings. Or so you said.\u201d</p><p>Andrew nodded. \u201cI behaved like a fool. I\u2019m sorry, Leah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? I was the one who owed you an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave it,\u201d Andrew reminded her, and something she couldn\u2019t read flared in his eyes, \u201cHell, I don\u2019t know what was wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed your space,\u201d Leah supplied, removing her coat and hanging it in the hall closet. \u201cWe all do at one time or another. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have let you go. You wanted to settle matters then and there. I was the one who made everything so difficult.\u201d He brought her into the circle of his arms and sighed as she relaxed against him. \u201cI love you so damn much,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. His fingers lovingly worked through the tangles in her hair. \u201cI love you too. You\u2019re right, Andrew, I realize that now and I\u2019m so sorry for the way I\u2019ve treated you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he whispered, gently kissing her. \u201cIt\u2019s forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most important person in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found the record book in the garbage. Do you mean it, honey? Can we stop worrying about a pregnancy and concentrate on each other?\u201d</p><p>Leah understood what he was asking. He wanted her to let go of the frantic need she had for a child, to stop looking for a pregnancy to fulfill her as a woman.</p><p>She\u2019d cheated her husband out of far more than she realized. All these years she\u2019d been subtly and not so subtly telling him his love wasn\u2019t enough. Every time she\u2019d dragged him to another doctor, to another fertility clinic, through another series of tests, she in essence said she found him lacking and that she needed something more. She tagged a condition onto her happiness, insisting she needed a child, the child he should give her.</p><p>Wrapping her arms around Andrew\u2019s neck, Leah slowly nodded. The dream was dead. It had been from the moment she realized what she\u2019d done to him.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Timmy greeted Jody at the door the minute she walked into the house after work Monday morning. \u201cA package came for me from Grandma Potter. Can I open it?\u201d He was hopping up and down like a pogo stick, following her from one room to the next. \u201cIt\u2019s addressed to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA package?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably for Christmas. You\u2019re not going to make me wait, are you?\u201d</p><p>Jody moved into the family room and stopped short. Timmy hadn\u2019t exaggerated, the package was huge. She was curious herself. Gloria was very good at remembering Timmy on his birthday and Christmas, but she generally sent a check, claiming he should save for his college education.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d do any harm to open it up,\u201d Jody said, curious herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the scissors all ready,\u201d Timmy said, racing into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t run with scissors in your hand,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a kid!\u201d Timmy chided, walking back with exaggeratedly slow steps.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jody said, smiling to herself.</p><p>The box had been carefully packaged, as if it contained something of exceptional value. Once the tape had been cut away they were able to peel back the cardboard lid. Timmy immediately starting digging when they discovered the box was filled with Styrofoam packing balls. The material flew in every direction. She laughed, watching her son virtually attack the present.</p><p>He bent over the top, his feet six inches off the ground. \u201cThere are a bunch of smaller boxes inside,\u201d he called, lifting out the first of what proved to be several.</p><p>Jody lined them up on the coffee table and Timmy opened the largest one first. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, bringing out a trophy.</p><p>Jody was puzzled herself.</p><p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s a letter in here for you.\u201d</p><p>Jody took the envelope and ripped it open.</p><p>Dearest Jody and Timmy,</p><p>You\u2019re were right, Jody. Jeff is dead and it\u2019s time I accepted as much. Forgive an old woman who can\u2019t bear to believe that her only son is gone. The truth was too painful to accept. Painful for you and Timmy too, I realize.</p><p>It came to me the other day that now Timmy\u2019s growing up, he might be interested in having the things that once belonged to his father. Jeff\u2019s childhood treasures are his now and don\u2019t belong to a grieving mother. Take them, and treasure them, but most of all, remember Jeff.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the trophy for?\u201d Timmy asked, turning it upside down and examining the bottom. \u201cThis is weird, the way they put it together.\u201d</p><p>Jody could barely speak for the tears in her throat. \u201cYour father won that when he was twelve,\u201d she said, holding onto the statue with both hands. \u201cFor soccer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad played soccer?\u201d</p><p>Jody nodded.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Jeff was wonderfully athletic, the same way Timmy was, but he\u2019d concentrated on football and track in high school and college.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Timmy said, \u201clook at this. It\u2019s really old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your dad\u2019s report card from when he was in the first grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was smart, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were too, weren\u2019t you, Mom?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Timmy was hurriedly opening one box and then the next. \u201cThis stuff is really neat. I can keep it, can\u2019t I, forever and ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to forget my dad. Never,\u201d he vowed, sitting back on his legs and releasing a slow, uneven sigh. \u201cYou know, Mom, it might not be such a good idea for you to get me another dad. Not when I already have one. It was just that until now he was a face in a picture you keep by the fireplace. But he was really a neat guy, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart,\u201d she agreed, \u201che was someone very special.\u201d</p><p>Timmy\u2019s eyes grew serious. \u201cThen it\u2019d be wrong to look for another dad.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Monica was in a tizzy. Chet had seen her standing outside of the Blue Goose, and knew she\u2019d sought him out. Her first thought was that she should adamantly deny everything. That, however, would be a lie and she prided herself on her honesty.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t stay away, could you?\u201d he said in that impertinent way of his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d she snapped. The buzz of traffic zoomed past her as she stiffly stood on the curb, waiting for the light to change.</p><p>Chet laughed, the sound mingling with those from the street and the busy holiday shoppers. The signal changed and she remained frozen, unable to move with the others.</p><p>\u201cI imagine that\u2019s as close to the truth as I\u2019m likely to get from you,\u201d he said, and gripping hold of her elbow, escorted her across the street. He didn\u2019t tell her where he was taking her and she didn\u2019t ask. Although she had long legs, she had trouble keeping up with his brisk pace.</p><p>He steered her into Woolworth\u2019s and over to the lunch counter.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d she demanded, disliking the assumptions he was making.</p><p>He ignored her and slipped into a booth. She would have brought attention to herself if she\u2019d continued standing so she uneasily claimed the seat across from him.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d he asked nonchalantly, reaching for the yellowed plastic-coated menu tucked behind the silver napkin dispenser.</p><p>\u201cI . . . as a matter of fact I am, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe steak sandwich is excellent and they don\u2019t do a bad chicken-fried steak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have coffee,\u201d she told him. By all that was right she shouldn\u2019t be sitting with him. She barely knew the man and what she did know was a cause for a twenty-four-hour prayer vigil.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p><p>The waitress came, an older woman with gray hair in a pale pink uniform. She chewed gum and looked more worn than the linoleum in Monica\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a BLT on wheat, with coffee,\u201d Chet ordered.</p><p>The waitress wrote down the order and looked to Monica expectantly.</p><p>\u201cThe same, only put mine on a separate ticket.\u201d</p><p>The woman left, jotting down Monica\u2019s order as she went.</p><p>\u201cI saw you outside the Blue Goose,\u201d Chet announced casually.</p><p>It was all Monica could do not to cover her face with her hands. It mortified her to know he\u2019d seen her standing outside the tavern, debating whether she should go inside or not.</p><p>\u201cI know why you were there too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Her rebellious gaze shot to his. She was certain he could see her pulse beating in the vein in her neck, the sound echoing in her ear like thunder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chet set the menu back in place and waited for the waitress to finish pouring their coffee before he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re curious about the same thing as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>He smiled without humor, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have enough courage or honesty to admit it so I\u2019ll say it. We\u2019re both trying to figure out if what happened between us was real.\u201d</p><p>Monica had entertained a whole spectrum of possibilities of what had happened when Chet had kissed her. She blamed him, then herself, and eventually her upbringing. Having lived a sheltered, protected life hadn\u2019t prepared her for the sensual magnetism she experienced at his touch.</p> <p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t have any intention of allowing you to kiss me again,\u201d she told him, the words ringing with disdain. It was important he understood this right now.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry, I\u2019m not exactly thrilled with the prospect myself. I\u2019m curious, and you have to admit you are too, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here. Frankly, I can\u2019t figure out what it is about you that intrigues me so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I was wondering the same thing myself. You won\u2019t leave me alone either.\u201d</p><p>Their sandwiches arrived and Chet tore into his as if he hadn\u2019t eaten in a week. Monica glared at him and pointedly reached for her napkin and spread it evenly across her lap. Bowing her head, she murmured a simple prayer of thanksgiving. When she\u2019d finished, she lifted half the sandwich from her plate, holding it daintily in both hands. Chet had started on the second half of his before she\u2019d taken the first bite.</p><p>When he finished, Chet reached inside his pocket and brought out a small spiral pad. He flipped through several pages until he found what he was looking for.</p> <p>\u201cYour father\u2019s name is Lloyd Fischer, the Reverend Lloyd Fischer. You\u2019re an only child and your mother died when you were in your teens. Currently the church employs you as a full-time secretary. You play the piano on Sunday mornings and teach a Sunday school class. Your two best friends are married and live in another state. It\u2019s said that you miss them dearly and write often.\u201d</p><p>Monica was so shocked it took an effort for her to disguise her distress. \u201cHow . . . how do you know all that?\u201d</p><p>Chet grinned suspiciously. \u201cI have my ways. I\u2019m a private investigator, remember? Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t find out what you could about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did not.\u201d She snapped her mouth closed before she added to the lie. She had looked up his name in the business directory and noted the address. His office was close to the Westlake Mall on First Avenue in a dingy part of town. The mission was situated on the same street and she\u2019d mentally calculated which building was his. She\u2019d looked his name up in the white pages as well and learned that his apartment was in the same building.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, pushing the empty plate aside and reaching for his coffee. \u201cDo you have any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure where he was leading, but she had no intention of continuing with this farce. Having lunch with him was about as far as she intended to go.</p> <p>\u201cFiguring out what\u2019s going on between us,\u201d he said loudly as if she were hard of hearing.</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Chet continued, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I like you. You annoy the hell out of me and at the same time I can\u2019t help thinking you could be a real woman if you\u2019d let yourself go a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Monica jerked her shoulders back and scowled at him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t exactly endeared yourself to me either, Mr. Costello. You\u2019re everything I don\u2019t want in a man.\u201d</p><p>Instead of insulting him, her words appeared to do just the opposite. He grinned as if she\u2019d stroked his ego with compliments. \u201cAin\u2019t it a bitch?\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped back at the use of vulgarity. \u201cKindly watch your language.\u201d</p><p>His grin was cocky in the extreme. \u201cYou want me so much you\u2019re practically frothing at the mouth.\u201d</p><p>Monica\u2019s hands were shaking so badly she could barely open her purse zipper. She removed her wallet and carefully extracted a ten-dollar bill, which she set next to her plate.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything more for us to say,\u201d she said crisply.</p><p>Chet held up his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be so hasty. We\u2019ve got several matters to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Monica slipped out of the booth and dramatically tossed her purse strap over her shoulder. \u201cI won\u2019t say it\u2019s been a pleasure,\u201d she said, taking her gloves from her coat pockets. \u201cGood-bye, Mr. Costello.\u201d</p><p>She heard him swear and winced at his words as she walked away. His hurried footsteps sounded behind her before she left the store and reached the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I apologize,\u201d Chet murmured impatiently, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>The man was full of surprises. She certainly hadn\u2019t counted on him making amends any more than she\u2019d expected him to chase after her. Monica wasn\u2019t sure how to react, or what she should do. She was more comfortable believing him to be a hopeless Neanderthal. His sincerity went against the assumptions she\u2019d made about him.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go for a walk?\u201d Chet asked before she had time to sort through her feelings. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a test of our control to see how long we can go without finding something to argue about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you suggest we walk?\u201d Monica asked, as if that were her only concern. She looked up at him and found his deep, blue eyes intently studying her.</p><p>\u201cThe waterfront\u2019s as good a place as any. There\u2019re always lots of things going on down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Her words were little more than wisps of sound. She hurriedly looked away because she found his gaze mesmerizing and buried her hands in her pockets. Chet followed suit, his own hands waist deep in the pockets of his beige coat.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know a lot about me,\u201d she said as a means of opening the conversation, \u201cit only seems fair for you to tell me something about yourself.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure, but this sounded like a good place for them to start. Her only concern was in knowing exactly what they were starting. She didn\u2019t know if she could be friends with this man, and anything else was impossible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-three and have never been married,\u201d Chet said, cutting into her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-five and I didn\u2019t ask you that,\u201d he barked, then seemed to regret his tart remark. \u201cI never found a woman who\u2019d be willing to put up with me.\u201d</p><p>Monica smiled to herself. \u201cI guess you could say the same thing about me. I don\u2019t seem to communicate very well with men. I thought I did, but I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like you\u2019re speaking from experience. I take it someone\u2019s hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about you, remember?\u201d</p><p>He frowned as if he found the subject boring and was much more interested in her. \u201cWhat do you want to know about me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, not knowing what to say. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go to school, that sort of thing, and how you got into the detective business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, releasing a beleaguered sigh. He seemed eager to get this part over so he could learn what he wanted to know about her. \u201cI graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in criminology and took a job with the local police force. After a few years I decided I\u2019d rather strike out on my own.\u201d</p><p>Monica speculated that there was a great deal missing in this story, but she didn\u2019t feel she should pressure him for details, not when she was unwilling to supply the missing pieces of her own story.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy police work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no. When I was shot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were shot?\u201d Monica couldn\u2019t hide her alarm. She studied him for any evidence of permanent injury, and her heart raced at a furious pace.</p><p>\u201cIt was little more than a flesh wound, nothing to worry about physically, at any rate.\u201d He hesitated as if he\u2019d said more than he intended, more than he wanted her to know.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she probed, not willing to drop the subject.</p><p>\u201cNothing. We\u2019ll leave it at that, all right?\u201d The way he said it told her she wouldn\u2019t get any more information out of him. Knowing that he\u2019d been physically injured had a curious effect on Monica. A strange sick feeling attacked her. Knowing he\u2019d suffered terrible pain greatly distressed her.</p><p>They reached the waterfront, the day was cold and gray, and the angry sky reflected on the waters of Puget Sound. The sidewalks were crowded with the heavy tourist and Christmas traffic.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you decide to become a private investigator?\u201d she asked as they stood at the end of the pier. The wind buffeted her and she turned her back on its force. Chet, however, leaned against the rough wood railing, his hands clenched.</p><p>Chet glanced her way. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to like the answer to this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked the question, didn\u2019t I?\u201d His attitude irked her.</p><p>\u201cAll right, since you asked, I\u2019ll tell you. A shapely blonde with loose morals and legs that reached all the way to her neck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Monica cut him off, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>They strolled back to the sidewalk and turned into a small shop that specialized in seashells, tacky souvenirs, and gaudy jewelry. Curious, Monica moved to a crowded aisle, no particular destination in mind. She found a paper Japanese fan with a brightly painted dragon and spread it open, fluttering it in front of her face.</p><p>Chet grinned and she lowered the fan. Slowly the amusement drained from his eyes and darkened to a shade as deep and dark as a moonless night. His sudden enmity unnerved her and she quickly snapped the fan closed and returned it to the table, wondering what she\u2019d done that had displeased him so.</p><p>His hand stopped her. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful when you choose to be,\u201d he said.</p><p>His words confused her as much as his look.</p><p>She turned hurriedly up another aisle and paused at a rack of necklaces. Taking one, she slid the chain against the palm of her hand until she reached the pendant. A mustard seed was framed in a glass teardrop. The scripture verse about faith the size of a mustard seed leaped into her mind.</p><p>\u201cFaith is an amazing thing,\u201d Chet surprised her by saying.</p><p>That he\u2019d know the verse shocked her. \u201cYou\u2019ve read the Bible.\u201d</p><p>He made a gallant effort not to laugh and failed. \u201cI\u2019m not a heathen, Monica, even if I\u2019ve been known to frequent seedy bars and sleep with immoral women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Embarrassed now by his honesty and her assumptions, she started to leave the shop. To her surprise, Chet took the necklace from her hand and carried it to the front of the store.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you believe in?\u201d she asked as they waited to make the purchase.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to believe in anything?\u201d</p><p>She could tell that the question made him uncomfortable. \u201cEveryone has a belief system, whether he acknowledges it or not.\u201d She sounded far more versed in the subject than she was. Her own had been so clearly defined for her from the time she was a child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t answer her for a long, silent moment. \u201cI believe life\u2019s a bitch,\u201d he said as he paid for the necklace.</p><p>Monica bristled, but then she\u2019d asked and he\u2019d told her.</p><p>He moved behind her and put the necklace around her neck. The glass teardrop felt cool against her skin. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, touched that he\u2019d bought it for her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make a big deal out of a few bucks,\u201d he said as if he regretted the purchase.</p> <p>When they came out of the store, Monica was surprised to find that it was snowing. She couldn\u2019t remember the weatherman mentioning snow. The fat flakes came down fast and furious and had already covered the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better hurry to the bus stop,\u201d she said, anxious to get home before the weather made it impossible. She was already an hour later than she said she\u2019d be.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d climbed the steep hill to the bus stop, Monica was breathless. It seemed that everyone in town had decided to head for home at the same time. Within minutes it became clear she was in for a long wait.</p><p>\u201cYou go on,\u201d she urged Chet. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d But he refused to leave her and after waiting a half hour, Chet shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll drive you home myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s snowing, and the road conditions might make that impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait out the craziness and once everything settles down I\u2019ll get my car out of the parking garage.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t leave room for her to argue, and she doubted he would have listened if she had. Chet steered her toward the exit and reached for her hand when it looked as if they might be separated in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked while they were making their way down the street. The conditions were blizzardlike. They were bent nearly in half as they walked against the brunt of the storm.</p><p>Chet didn\u2019t bother to answer until they entered a redbrick building. In the foyer, he stamped the snow from his shoes and led the way to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked, obediently following him.</p> <p>\u201cMy building, and before you get that outraged virgin look I promise I won\u2019t so much as touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better call my father or else he\u2019ll worry.\u201d Monica sincerely doubted that he\u2019d ever dated a woman who needed to check in with her family. She was pleased she couldn\u2019t read his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Chet said. At his floor, he took her down a narrow, dark hallway. His office had his name painted on a milky white door. Chet inserted the key and opened it for her, letting her precede him.</p><p>The first thing Monica noticed was the calendar with a naked blond woman sprawled out on a blanket of black velvet. The year 1963 was printed in bold letters down the side. His desk looked as if it had weathered a war on the losing side. It was scarred and battered and so cluttered it was impossible to see any part of the surface. His chair came straight out of the 1920s. A row of antique slot machines lined one wall.</p><p>Chet made his way around her and Monica realized she\u2019d been blocking the doorway. \u201cThis is my office,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cYour calendar\u2019s for the wrong year,\u201d she said, her voice little more than a whisper.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOnly a woman would notice that.\u201d He walked over to the other door and opened it. \u201cHome, sweet home,\u201d he said, gesturing for her to go before him.</p><p>Monica was just getting accustomed to the disarray in his office. She held her breath as she stepped into his living quarters, preparing herself for the worst.</p> <p>She hesitated in the doorway. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d she said, then realized she\u2019d verbalized the thought. There appeared to be some order to his studio apartment, compared to the chaos of his office.</p><p>Dishes were washed and stacked on the drainboard and the only food on the counter was a bowl with three overripe bananas. The sofa was a large overstuffed one with a stack of laundry\u2014she couldn\u2019t tell if it was clean or dirty\u2014piled in one corner.</p><p>\u201cThe phone\u2019s by the television,\u201d Chet said. \u201cI\u2019ll make us some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, taking several tentative steps into the room and reaching for the phone. Her father answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cI got caught in the snow,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t leave with the others.\u201d Her father was rarely angry, but he was close to being so now. \u201cJust how do you propose to get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult, Dad, I can take care of myself. Stop worrying. I\u2019ll call again if I run into any problems.\u201d Rather than get into discourse that required explanations, she quickly ended the conversation. When she\u2019d finished, Chet brought her a steaming mug of coffee.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s instant,\u201d he said, and with one sweeping motion of his hand, he cleared the surface of the sofa.</p><p>Monica sat close to the edge of the cushions, cradling the mug with both hands, her back straight, her knees together. Rarely had she felt more out of place. She\u2019d never been alone with a man in an apartment before and her sensibilities were badly shaken. Chet had promised to be a gentleman, and to her dismay she was sadly disappointed by his assurance.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Chet said, sounding irritated. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re waiting for me to pounce on you. I said I wouldn\u2019t touch you.\u201d</p><p>She decided to ignore the comment. \u201cDo you have any idea of how much snow is forecast?\u201d she asked, looking for a means of light conversation. She wished now that she\u2019d stayed and waited for a bus. No matter how tardy the transportation it would have saved them both this awkwardness.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, the weatherman didn\u2019t know about this. You don\u2019t honestly expect me to figure it out, do you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the way he said sweetheart. He made the term of affection sound like an insult. \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen here, honeybunch,\u201d she murmured sarcastically, \u201cI\u2019m not your sweetheart or anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were. Let\u2019s just forget it, all right?\u201d He stalked over to the sink and dumped what was left of his coffee. \u201cI\u2019ll see about getting you home now.\u201d</p><p>One look out the window told her the snow hadn\u2019t let up in the least; if anything, it was coming down heavier. Chet wanted to be rid of her and she was just as eager to go. She didn\u2019t know what she was doing with a man who hung a picture of a naked woman in his office. She was out of her element and eager to get back where she belonged.</p><p>\u201cI can take the bus.\u201d She felt obliged to volunteer, but it was doubtful how much longer the transit would continue to run in the heavy snow.</p><p>Chet cast her a look that told her what he thought of that idea. \u201cCome on, this might take a while.\u201d</p><p>Monica bundled her coat around her and hurried after him. The wind was bitterly cold as it sliced through the open garage. Chet drove a battered Chevy Impala with a tail pipe that hung so low she wondered if he could make it over a speed bump. She couldn\u2019t imagine that the faded green was a factory color.</p><p>\u201cMy Mercedes is in the shop,\u201d he said, unlocking the passenger door for her.</p><p>Monica let herself inside and searched until she found the seat belt, clicking it into place. Chet started the engine, which came to life with the roar of a lion, and pulled out of the parking space.</p><p>The streets were terrible, and the traffic was a nightmare, but Chet was an excellent driver and managed to avoid the worst of it. Monica breathed a sigh of relief as they left the congested downtown area.</p><p>Both were quiet for several minutes, and as they neared her neighborhood, Monica tensed. \u201cIt might be a good idea if you dropped me off a block or so before the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You aren\u2019t wearing boots\u2014your feet would be drenched within minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s just that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll save you having to make explanations if your father happens to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured, appreciating that he\u2019d said it for her. He drove a few more blocks, before pulling over to the side of the road. The church and parsonage were within sight, but it wasn\u2019t likely that her father would notice her with Chet.</p><p>Now that she was near home, Monica wasn\u2019t eager for her time with Chet to end. She clenched her purse in her lap with both hands. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, fingering the mustard-seed necklace. \u201cFor everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink nothing of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d she said, more adamant this time. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do this and I appreciate everything you went through . . . even when it didn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d Only heaven knew how long it would take him to drive back into the city. The streets were difficult enough as it was.</p><p>Chet\u2019s hands were braced against the steering wheel, his gaze focused straight ahead. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we solved anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the monster I assumed,\u201d she said, making light of her prejudices. Honesty, however, could be a burden. Now that she\u2019d admitted as much, she wasn\u2019t sure where that left them. Monica didn\u2019t know and she doubted that Chet did either.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not quite as prudish as I believed.\u201d</p><p>They looked toward each other and a smile blossomed between them, slow and sweet. Time stood perfectly still, but it seemed impatient as if waiting for them to act. The stillness swelled around them, cutting off sound except the silent wonder of the falling snow.</p><p>Monica didn\u2019t know who moved first. It didn\u2019t seem that either of them had, when she found her mouth inches from his. Chet was motionless. She could barely feel his breath, barely feel her own. She should move, should turn away from him and flee while she could, but she couldn\u2019t make herself do it. Enthralled, she raised her hands and placed them on his shoulders. He felt solid and strong. Her touch was all Chet needed. He bent forward and claimed her mouth in a slow, leisurely exercise.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the way it was before. It was much better . . . much worse. She dragged her mouth from his, frustration close to the surface, but she wasn\u2019t allowed to vent that or anything else. Before she could so much as draw in a stabilizing breath, Chet caught her face and brought her mouth back to his.</p><p>His need was urgent now and he kissed her again and again as waves of confusion assaulted her. A warm, dizzy feeling began to build within her, spreading throughout her body. The sensation flooded every cell. She was aware of everything about Chet, the taste, the feel, the masculine scent of him.</p><p>When they did finally ease away from each other, neither of them seemed to know what to say.</p><p>Slowly, Monica raised her eyes to his. His gaze revealed the extent of his confusion. The same bewilderment, the same questions, the same doubts.</p><p>Monica had no idea how long they stared. The air crackled with static electricity, with sexual tension.</p><p>\u201cYou better get inside,\u201d he said, and his voice sounded as if it were coming from the bottom of a deep well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded and turned away from him. Her hand was on the car door when he spoke again.</p><p>\u201cWill the choir be downtown again any time soon?\u201d he asked brusquely.</p><p>Monica wasn\u2019t so dense not to know what he wanted. He was asking to see her again. She shook her head and not daring to look at him, she said, \u201cI was planning to do some Christmas shopping though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p> <p>The question shouldn\u2019t have been so difficult. Her plans had been nebulous at best. Sometime over the next weekend, but that seemed far too long to wait to see Chet again. A whole week was out of the question.</p><p>\u201cMonday night,\u201d she said, still not looking at him. \u201cAround six.\u201d Not waiting for a sign of confirmation from him, she hurriedly climbed out of the car. Walking as fast as she could, she rushed toward the house, not looking back until she reached her front porch. Only then did she chance a look over her shoulder.</p><p>Chet was parked in the same spot, she noted, waiting for her to make it safely inside the house.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Just when everything was straight in her mind, this had to happen, Jody mused as she drove home from work Tuesday afternoon. The snow that had taken Seattle by surprise on Sunday had melted away Monday morning to a dirty slush that filled the side streets.</p> <p>Jody\u2019s route from the house to the office had been traveled so often she could almost do it blind. She avoided the busy intersections by taking a side street that led her past Providence Hospital.</p><p>For reasons she couldn\u2019t explain even to herself, she pulled into the hospital parking lot and climbed out of her car. Glen had asked to take Timmy and her out for pizza Thursday evening, and she\u2019d put him off, claiming she had to check her schedule. He\u2019d seemed surprised and disappointed, but he hadn\u2019t questioned her further.</p><p>Timmy claimed he didn\u2019t want another father, not now, not after he\u2019d carefully gone through Jeff\u2019s items. For the first time his natural father was real to him. It didn\u2019t seem right to start another relationship now.</p><p>The nativity scene had been up for several days and she\u2019d driven past it for the last seven years without ever stopping. Now seemed the perfect time. Now seemed the worst possible moment.</p><p>She walked over and stood before the manger scene, and breathed in the serenity.</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she whispered, \u201chelp me.\u201d She didn\u2019t honestly expect him to hear her, nor did she believe it was possible for him to respond to her despondent prayer. Yet she reached out to him, because she wasn\u2019t sure which way to turn.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d like Glen,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of man you would have called a friend.\u201d</p><p>The only sounds that returned to her were from the traffic in the streets.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t helping, Jody realized. Nor was it hurting. She took a few more minutes to soak in whatever comfort she could before returning to the car.</p><p>Timmy was waiting for her. Every day she called the babysitter when she left the office and Timmy walked down the block, unlocked the house, and was there when she arrived home a few minutes later. It made him feel less of a kid and more of a young adult. Less of a Timmy and more of a Tim.</p><p>The lights shone from the windows as she pulled into the driveway. Timmy was in the family room, the football video game blaring from the television screen.</p><p>\u201cGlen called,\u201d he told her when she joined him.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring in the mail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the counter. Nothing interesting, just bills.\u201d</p> <p>Jody sorted through the small stack, disappointed not to receive so much as a single Christmas card. Her own had yet to be mailed.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to call Glen back?\u201d Timmy wanted to know as he expertly manipulated the game control.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d She scooted the ottoman over to her son, who was kneeling on the floor, intent on his game. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute, Mom, I\u2019m just to the good part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to save the world again?\u201d</p><p>He broke his concentration long enough to cast her a disgruntled look. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that with football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Apparently having lost, he groaned and set aside the controller. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, looking at her expectantly. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlen wanted to take us out to dinner one day this week. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Timmy\u2019s eyes brightened with enthusiasm before his gaze slid to the row of trophies he\u2019d set out the night before on the fireplace mantel.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need another dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you said that earlier, I just wanted to be sure you meant it.\u201d</p><p>Although he looked disappointed, Timmy said, \u201cI meant it. You\u2019d better call Glen back and tell him no.\u201d</p><p>Timmy was unusually quiet during dinner, but Jody wasn\u2019t up to much conversation herself. After she\u2019d finished the dishes, she phoned Glen, and was grateful when his answering machine came on. It was a cowardly thing to do, but she left a message on his recorder declining his offer to take Timmy and her to dinner.</p><p>Timmy was sound asleep when the doorbell chimed. Jody glanced at her watch, wondering who\u2019d be dropping by unannounced at this late hour. She hesitated, then realized anyone who intended to do her harm wasn\u2019t likely to ring the doorbell first.</p><p>Glen stood on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cGlen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s late, but do you have a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, stepping aside.</p><p>A blast of cold air accompanied him as he stepped into her house. He rubbed his hands together and cast her an apologetic look.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, continuing to look uneasy. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</p><p>Jody felt a twinge of guilt over the way she\u2019d rejected his offer to take Timmy and her out for pizza. It had been a cowardly thing to do.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sit down,\u201d she said, motioning toward the kitchen table while she assembled a pot of coffee and waited for the liquid to drain through.</p><p>Glen stood until she\u2019d finished with the coffee before he took a seat himself. Jody guessed that this didn\u2019t have anything to do with manners. He seemed preoccupied and nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what I want to say,\u201d he began, stretching his arms across her tabletop. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that I\u2019m making a fool of myself. I seem to do that when it comes to dealing with women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true.\u201d Jody\u2019s guilt was mounting until it was a palatable thing. Glen was one of the nicest men she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>\u201cI guess the real reason I\u2019m here is to ask you what I did wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize I was rushing you and if I haven\u2019t already apologized for that, then I am now. I . . . it\u2019s just that I think the world of you and Timmy, and knowing I\u2019d done something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlen,\u201d she said, interrupting him. \u201cBelieve me, please, it isn\u2019t anything you said or did. Timmy received a package from his grandmother, Jeff\u2019s mother, with things that had been Jeff\u2019s as a boy, and now . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d Glen finished for her, \u201cTimmy feels another man in his life would be betraying his father\u2019s memory.\u201d Glen grew silent for a moment, then slowly he leveled his gaze on her. \u201cMore important, so would you. I know how much you loved Jeff,\u201d he continued, his voice gaining conviction, \u201cthat was one of the things that attracted me to you the most. You\u2019re not the kind of woman who\u2019d give her heart lightly, and when you do, it means something.\u201d</p><p>The compliment made her uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cThat appeals to me, Jody, because I\u2019m that kind of person myself. I didn\u2019t fall in love until recently and it\u2019s been hell getting over that relationship. Love means more to me than being sexually compatible. It means being an important part of your life as you\u2019ll be in mine. It means encouraging you to be everything you\u2019ve ever wanted to be, sharing in your triumphs and comforting you in your failures. It means giving you the courage to try again. That\u2019s what love is all about.\u201d</p><p>Jody didn\u2019t know what to say. She wasn\u2019t likely to meet anyone like Glen in a good long time. A man who looked outside himself was a rarity. He\u2019d spoken of his broken relationship and the pain it had brought him, and yet he was willing to trust again, willing to love again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about marriage for a long time,\u201d Glen went on. \u201cAnd because of that I\u2019ve put unnecessary pressure on you and Timmy. I want you to know how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, \u201cdon\u2019t apologize again. It isn\u2019t anything you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>He stood as if sitting had become intolerable. \u201cI want you to know I don\u2019t plan on taking Jeff away from you and Timmy. It would be impossible. All I\u2019m asking is that you give me a chance to prove myself to you. All I\u2019m asking is that you make room in your life for me.\u201d</p><p>Jody recalled the way her son\u2019s eyes had lit up when she mentioned the outing with Glen and how that expression had gradually faded as he looked at the trophies that had once belonged to his father. Like her, Timmy had assumed having dinner with another man would betray Jeff\u2019s memory.</p><p>Glen plowed his hand through his hair. \u201cI realize men aren\u2019t supposed to react to rejection like this. We\u2019re supposed be flippant and to take it on the chin and all that. Forgive me, Jody, if I\u2019ve made you uncomfortable. I hope I haven\u2019t embarrassed you, but I wanted to speak my piece. I figured I\u2019d better do it while I had the courage.\u201d He turned and walked out of her kitchen.</p><p>He was at the front door before she stopped him. \u201cGlen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for stopping by. You\u2019ve given me something to think about. I\u2019ll . . . probably see you at the copy machine soon.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and his soft, dark eyes held hers captive. \u201cI can be patient, Jody, I just haven\u2019t proved it yet, but I promise you I will.\u201d With that, he turned and let himself out the door.</p><p>\u201cHere they come.\u201d Bonnie Stewart stuck her head in the labor room door where Leah was stripping the sheets from the bed. Her patient had recently delivered a healthy eight-pound baby girl, her third child. The labor and delivery had gone smoothly and mother and father were delighted with their latest addition.</p><p>Leah\u2019s shift had been over half an hour earlier and she\u2019d hoped to be long gone before the birthing-class tour group arrived. There was something about ten pregnant woman parading through the labor and delivery rooms that left a sour taste in her mouth.</p><p>She was being unfair, Leah realized, but meeting with these groups had always been a painful experience for her. Dealing with the mothers-to-be, one and often two or three at a time, was challenge enough. A roomful tested the very limits of her patience.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out of here in nothing flat,\u201d Leah tossed over her shoulder. Bonnie didn\u2019t know the extent of Leah\u2019s dislike for these predelivery tours, but she was aware enough to warn her the little darlings were on their way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLeah, hello.\u201d</p><p>Once Leah had been asked to be a guest speaker for one of the birthing classes and she\u2019d talked briefly about labor and delivery and answered an hour or more of questions. As luck would have it, the tour guide was Jo Ann Rossini who\u2019d been the instructor for the class Leah had visited. Jo Ann walked into the room with ten or more women, all in varying stages of pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cLadies, this is the nurse I mentioned earlier. I sincerely hope one of you is lucky enough to go into labor during Leah\u2019s shift. Leah Lundberg is one of the most wonderful labor coaches you\u2019re likely to meet.\u201d</p><p>Leah appreciated Jo Ann\u2019s kind words, but she was eager to escape.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out of your way in just a moment,\u201d Leah said, bundling up the sheets and stuffing them in the laundry basket.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to hurry. You\u2019d probably do a much better job of giving a tour around the labor room than me,\u201d Jo Ann insisted.</p><p>\u201cLeah\u2019s shift was over a half hour ago,\u201d Bonnie said, coming in. Leah was so grateful she could have kissed her fellow nurse, not that staying beyond when they were scheduled was anything out of the ordinary. It was part and parcel of her job, which, despite everything, Leah loved.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if we asked you a couple of questions?\u201d A timid voice rose from the back of the group. The girl didn\u2019t look to be any more than eighteen, with eyes the size of poker chips. Her hand rested on her protruding stomach, which she rubbed as if to reassure her unborn child.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only got a few moments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mother said only a woman who\u2019s been through labor and birth can fully appreciate what it\u2019s like for another woman,\u201d one of the other mothers-to-be added loudly. She was large and brusque and looked as if she wanted to punish her husband for getting her into this predicament. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s true?\u201d she added on a brash note.</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d This definitely wasn\u2019t an area Leah wanted to address. \u201cA doctor doesn\u2019t have to experience a festering cut to know how to treat one,\u201d she said, making sure no emotion bled into the words.</p><p>\u201cHow long can we expect the labor to last?\u201d came another question. This one was less intrusive.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different with every woman, as individual as we each are. I\u2019ve seen women who suffer little more than a few twinges of pain, and others who feel like they\u2019re giving birth to a grand piano. Labor can last anywhere from a few minutes to days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat long?\u201d It was the same timid voice that had spoken earlier.</p><p>\u201cJust remember the vast majority are within the normal range.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Leah,\u201d Jo Ann said, stepping forward. \u201cWe appreciate your taking the time for this. I know you\u2019re on your way home so we won\u2019t keep you any longer. Remember Leah,\u201d Jo Ann said, speaking to her class. \u201cBecause once you\u2019ve had her with you during labor you aren\u2019t likely to ever forget her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne last question.\u201d The same brassy woman who\u2019d spoken earlier did so again. \u201cTell us how many children you\u2019ve had yourself.\u201d</p><p>Leah looked at the other woman, her gaze connecting with hers. \u201cNone,\u201d she said, then turned and walked out of the room. Her steps gained speed as she hurried down the hallway, tears blurring her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBremerton,\u201d Shirley said, joining Mercy on the deserted flight deck of the aircraft carrier Nimitz. Bright stars dappled the crisp December night like beacons from home. \u201cWhy in the name of heaven did you decide we should meet here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like ships, especially navy ones.\u201d</p><p>Goodness shared a meaningful look with Shirley. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything, have you?\u201d</p><p>Mercy\u2019s eyes widened as if she were offended by the suggestion. \u201cGood grief, I know better than to move ships around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel wouldn\u2019t ignore that,\u201d Shirley said, folding her arms and glancing approvingly toward Mercy as if to say she appreciated the maturity Mercy revealed.</p> <p>\u201cGabriel, nothing,\u201d Mercy said, \u201cI don\u2019t plan on tangling with the U.S. Navy. They can be real sticklers about that sort of thing, although it would be fun just once to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy!\u201d both Goodness and Shirley cried simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you guys, don\u2019t you know a joke when you hear one?\u201d The petite angel drifted effortlessly upward, resting on the bridge.</p><p>Goodness wasn\u2019t sure of anything these earth days. Humans had frustrated her in the past, but she\u2019d never had to deal with one as obstinate and foolish as Monica Fischer. There was a soft spot in her heart for preachers\u2019 children. Goodness was convinced Gabriel was aware of her feelings and that was what had prompted him to give her this particular assignment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to change the subject, but are those submarines over there?\u201d Shirley asked. She was dangling from the top of the communication tower and pointed to a series of seven fast-attack black boats docked in the murky, moonless waters at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll ever understand how the human mind works. Imagine designing a boat that\u2019s supposed to sink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get back to the matters at hand?\u201d Mercy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you I\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end when it comes to helping Leah and Andrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Goodness cried.</p><p>Shirley cleared her throat. \u201cTo be honest, I should tell you matters aren\u2019t going all that well for me either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shirley held up her hand, stopping them both. \u201cTimmy\u2019s grandmother ruined everything for me. It\u2019s as bad now as it ever was. Jody turned down Glen\u2019s dinner invitation and Timmy believes if he becomes friends with Glen that he\u2019ll dishonor the memory of his father.\u201d</p><p>Goodness felt sorry for her friend. They should have realized nothing is ever as easy as it seems, but then Shirley had been so smug about her assignment.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Shirley admitted. \u201cGlen\u2019s patient, but I wonder just how long he\u2019ll continue to invite Jody if she shows no signs of wanting to go out with him. Until the package arrived from his grandmother, Timmy was working with me, and we all know what an advantage it is to have a child on our side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is it until Christmas?\u201d Earth time always served to confuse Goodness.</p><p>\u201cThree weeks,\u201d Shirley mumbled, her wings sagging with discouragement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got plenty of time, just be patient and do what you can,\u201d Mercy suggested. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a way, I know you will.\u201d</p><p>Goodness didn\u2019t have any better ideas herself. Her own lack of success with answering Monica\u2019s prayer request was getting downright depressing. The preacher\u2019s daughter claimed she wanted a husband, yet she ignored the attention of the man most suitable. Instead she was flirting with disaster secretly meeting a private eye with an attitude problem.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing worse than ever,\u201d Mercy admitted grudgingly as if this were something new the others hadn\u2019t figured out yet. \u201cShirley had a great idea. She felt, and I\u2019m in complete agreement, that if Leah could sample joy, then she might find the steps leading to serenity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d Mercy admitted, telling them about the scene in the hospital with the birthing class earlier that day. \u201cI haven\u2019t figured out how to help her. Leah\u2019s more miserable now than when I first arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you told me she seemed more accepting.\u201d</p><p>Mercy folded her arms. \u201cPerhaps. It\u2019s difficult for me to tell. She\u2019s been overly burdened lately with work, the holidays, and the guilt of knowing how badly she\u2019s hurt her husband with her demands for a child. If anything, her grip on her pain has tightened\u2014she holds it close to her heart so that it suffocates her happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Leah,\u201d Shirley whispered, then turned her attention toward Goodness. \u201cWhat about you? Are matters any better with Monica Fischer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m growing more and more concerned about Monica,\u201d Goodness said, sharing her own disappointment. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t given Michael the time of day and he\u2019s such a dear young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound as if you\u2019re attracted to him yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Well, who wouldn\u2019t be? He\u2019s dedicated and caring and a prince of a guy, not that Monica\u2019s noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the private eye?\u201d</p><p>Goodness tossed her hands into the air. \u201cShe continues to meet him on the sly. My guess is she\u2019s more attracted to him than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>Goodness cringed. \u201cThe more I know about Chet Costello the less impressed I am. He\u2019s lived hard and loved hard and it shows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want from Monica?\u201d</p><p>Goodness didn\u2019t have the answer to that any more than she did the other questions. \u201cAs far as I can guess, she\u2019s everything he isn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t share her faith, her interests, her values, yet he\u2019s attracted to those qualities. He carries the misery of his past with him, and as far as I can see he hasn\u2019t cared about anything or anyone for the last four or five years, himself included.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, there might be hope for him yet,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cMonica must think so too, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t continue seeing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you suggest such a thing?\u201d Goodness demanded. To her way of thinking, any relationship between the two was doomed from the start. If anyone was capable of teaching Monica the lessons she needed to know, it would be Michael, not Chet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any suggestions for you,\u201d Mercy told her. \u201cI\u2019m having enough trouble dealing with my own problems with Leah. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be of more help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret,\u201d Goodness said as a means of encouragement to her friends.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got three weeks yet,\u201d Shirley reminded them. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to panic. Anything can happen in that time, anything at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Mercy said, eyeing the aircraft carrier Carl Vinjon. Goodness recognized that gleam in her friend\u2019s eye. It spelled trouble. She had to be honest, she found the radar system downright attractive. And feeling as disgruntled as she did with humans and romance, Goodness didn\u2019t think she should be held responsible for what might happen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both right,\u201d Shirley agreed, glancing toward the submarines. \u201cAnything\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>Crews from all three Seattle television stations were at the Bremerton shipyard the following morning. The sky was filled with navy helicopters that circled overhead, and a no-fly zone had been declared.</p><p>The top navy brass converged on the area and the activity on Sinclair Inlet was unprecedented. No less than ten navy vessels circled the area. Three of the fast-attack submarines patrolled the waters.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell us exactly what\u2019s happening here?\u201d Brian Lewis asked Marilyn Brock, a reporter from Seattle\u2019s ABC television affiliate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marilyn Brock pressed the earphone to her head. \u201cAs best we\u2019ve been able to learn, the aircraft carrier Nimitz and the Carl Vinson have traded places. You heard me right, Brian and Carol, traded places. The Nimitz was docked at Pier 12 and is now in Pier 24, where the Carl Vinson was formerly docked.</p><p>\u201cAlso from what we\u2019ve been able to find out, despite very tight security, an unidentified object showed on the radar screens this last evening. Reports are mixed. Some claim it was nothing more than a commercial flight off course, but others have said it was the silhouette of an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn angel?\u201d Brian Lewis repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me right. This is definitely one for the record books.\u201d</p> <p>Chet had called himself every kind of fool. He\u2019d waited around the area at the Westlake Mall for nearly thirty minutes and Monica had yet to show. After the tempestuous kisses they\u2019d shared, she\u2019d probably had her sensibilities so shaken she decided against seeing him again. It was just as well. Their relationship wasn\u2019t headed anywhere.</p><p>Monica Fischer was little more than a passing fancy to him, but even as he said the words, Chet wondered if they were true. What she was to him remained a deep, dark secret, even to himself.</p><p>Well, there wasn\u2019t any need to wait around here any longer. If she was going to meet him, she would have done so earlier. A cold beer would ease his disappointment, he decided, heading toward the Blue Goose.</p><p>\u201cChet, Chet Costello.\u201d</p><p>He caught the tail end of his name and whirled around, searching through a mob of empty faces, seeking Monica. His heart gladdened when he caught sight of her making her way through the crowds, weaving in and around those who were going too slow to suit her.</p> <p>She wore her hair up and tightly pulled away from her face. The severe style sharpened her features, but Chet was too pleased to see her to worry about the way she wore her hair or the drab, lifeless colors that made up her wardrobe.</p><p>She was breathless by the time he reached her. He stopped himself just in time, otherwise he would have wrapped his arms around her and lifted her off the ground. As it was, his arms gripped hold of her elbows.</p><p>\u201cI had trouble getting away,\u201d she explained, smiling up at him, her pretty eyes revealing her relief. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d still be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just about to give up,\u201d he admitted. They were causing something of a distraction and Chet turned, looping his arm over her shoulder and guiding her across the street. He hadn\u2019t a clue of how much time they\u2019d have together, but he fully intended to make the most of it.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Monica asked.</p><p>Chet paused. \u201cDo you have any particular place in mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d agree. \u201cMy apartment. You look half frozen and it\u2019s the only place I can think of where we\u2019ll have some privacy.\u201d</p><p>Her steps slowed. \u201cI . . . don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked. He\u2019d perfected his innocent look until it was practically an art form. \u201cI was thinking we could talk, and get to know each other a little better.\u201d Sure he intended to talk, but there was a whole lot more on his agenda. Monica possessed a delectable body that she carefully disguised behind clothes that were at least one size too large for her. She needed to learn exactly what it meant to be a woman, and he was an able teacher. Ready and able. It had been a good long while since he\u2019d been this strongly attracted to a woman. That worried him, but not enough to prevent him from seeing Monica. He\u2019d sort through his feelings later once he\u2019d coaxed her into his bed.</p><p>Generally Chet preferred to relieve his sexual frustrations with Trixie, a cocktail waitress who worked at the Blue Goose on weekends. They had a long-standing relationship, or better said, a long-standing understanding. They didn\u2019t pretend to be in love, pretense was beyond them both. A divorc\u00e9e with two teenagers to raise on her own, the cocktail waitress wasn\u2019t looking for another long-term relationship, and God knew he wasn\u2019t either. They were comfortable with each other.</p><p>\u201cI have to get back before nine, otherwise my father will ask a lot of questions and I refuse to lie to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of heaven, you\u2019re twenty-five years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>Pressuring her wasn\u2019t going to help his cause any. The way he figured it, after he\u2019d made love to Monica he\u2019d be over whatever it was that attracted him so strongly, and would exorcise her from his thoughts and his life.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could have coffee and talk,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cPeople might see us.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Obviously that thought hadn\u2019t occurred to her, and being seen with him would surely be cause for talk. That might put her father and her in an embarrassing situation. Monica loved her father too much to do anything that would hurt him in any way.</p><p>\u201cWe could find a dark corner somewhere,\u201d she suggested next.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going to be nearly as easy as he\u2019d assumed. \u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed, \u201con one condition. I want you to take the pins out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him as if he were daft. Her fingers tentatively investigated the back of her head. \u201cYou want me to let my hair down?\u201d</p><p>It should have been clear, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I need a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s such an unusual request.\u201d Already her fingers were working at the pins, unfolding the thick knot of hair, which streamed over her shoulders in a warm cascade of dark chestnut. She kept her gaze lowered as though she felt foolish.</p><p>He was right. Her looks were substantially softened by the effect. She was lovely, more so than he would have guessed. Her face was fresh and scrubbed clean. It didn\u2019t take much to imagine what a little makeup would do for her already appealing good looks.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said, when it became apparent she was waiting for him to say something. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019re waiting to be thrown to the lions now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d she said, her eyes snapping.</p><p>Chet laughed boisterously and reached for her hand. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go have that coffee before we start arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I dress this way for a reason. I\u2019m trying to promote a meek and humble spirit. With the world the way it is, with girls looking to Madonna as a role model, I feel I should do my part to promote purity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, listen, you shouldn\u2019t knock those scantily clad outfits until you\u2019ve tried one. Just promise me you\u2019ll let me be there when you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t say things like that.\u201d</p><p>He probably shouldn\u2019t have. She was as skittish as a colt, as well he could understand. This was probably the most daring thing she\u2019d ever done in her life, meeting him this way without her father knowing what she was up to.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to tell you how sorry I am?\u201d he asked, as they made their way down First Avenue. A dingy caf\u00e9 he frequented was about the only place he could think of where they\u2019d have a bit of privacy.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her response surprised him. He was thinking she\u2019d demand an apology of him and then proceed to lecture him on the error of his ways. Perhaps there was hope for her after all.</p><p>The caf\u00e9 was dreary, and he felt a bit embarrassed to be bringing Monica into such an establishment, but since she\u2019d turned down the offer to visit his apartment, that didn\u2019t leave them with much choice.</p><p>He led her to a table in the back and called out his order for two coffees. The chef, Artie Williams, who was an old army cook, appeared from inside the kitchen. He wore a grease-smeared T-shirt and apron.</p><p>Artie glanced curiously toward Monica when he delivered two ceramic mugs. \u201cYou\u2019re out of your element with this girl, aren\u2019t you, Chet?\u201d he said in his gravelly voice.</p><p>\u201cJust pour the coffee and keep the commentary to yourself,\u201d Chet barked. He was having trouble enough breaking down Monica\u2019s barriers without his so-called friend\u2019s help.</p><p>Monica held the cup between both hands as if she were looking to warm her palms. \u201cWhat would you like to talk about?\u201d she asked, her eyes nervously avoiding his.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you come?\u201d he asked. He\u2019d feel he was making progress if he could get her to admit to their attraction.</p><p>\u201cI . . . don\u2019t know. Michael asked me to stop by his house this evening and I had to make up this excuse and the whole time I was on the bus I kept thinking I must be crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re both crazy,\u201d he muttered, and sipped his coffee. It was hot, black, and thick. Just the way he liked it.</p><p>Monica sipped hers too, made a face, then reached for the sugar bowl. She added three heaping teaspoons before she sampled the liquid again.</p><p>\u201cWhere does that leave us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking you could tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She raised her eyes to his, then quickly lowered them. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever kissed me the way you have.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t come as any surprise to Chet. \u201cThat\u2019s only the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing is the tip of the iceberg. There are a dozen different directions we could go from there.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him as if she hadn\u2019t a clue what he was talking about and he realized what should have been obvious from the beginning. Monica Fischer, preacher\u2019s daughter, was a virgin. He didn\u2019t know there were any left in the world and damned if he hadn\u2019t stumbled onto the last living one.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou look as if you just swallowed a basketball whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel that way.\u201d He stood so abruptly that the chair shot two feet away from the table. Slapping a fistful of change on the table he reached for her arm, practically lifting her out of the chair. \u201cCome on, we\u2019re out of here.\u201d</p><p>His grip was so tight, Monica\u2019s toes barely touched the ground.</p><p>\u201cChet,\u201d she cried, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting you out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked. The way her voice struggled to stay even revealed the extent of her surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you back to the bus stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She shook herself free of his hold and whirled around to face him.</p><p>\u201cBecause, sweetheart, I just realized something. You\u2019re a virgin and I\u2019m the last person you should be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. Apparently she still hadn\u2019t caught on.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, having trouble keeping the anger out of his voice, although it was directed at himself, and not her. He was a bigger fool than he\u2019d realized.</p><p>\u201cBecause doesn\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>She was having trouble keeping pace with him, but Chet didn\u2019t care. The sooner he was rid of her the better.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s so terrible about being a virgin. Good grief, you make it sound like I\u2019ve got a communicable disease or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right, since you want to know I\u2019ll tell you, but you aren\u2019t going to like it.\u201d Chet stopped in the middle of the sidewalk. Although it was well past seven the streets were busy. Several people were forced to walk around them. \u201cI wanted you to go to my apartment tonight for one reason and one reason only. I planned to seduce you.\u201d</p><p>Monica went pale. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently you don\u2019t. Good-bye, Monica.\u201d Having said that he turned and walked away, leaving her standing alone in the middle of the sidewalk.</p><p>Chapter 10</p> <p>\u201cMom, I need another dollar.\u201d Timmy raced up to the table at the pizza parlor, his face bright and his eyes sparkling with excitement. \u201cI\u2019m blowing the brains out of the Laser Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the kind of video game I want you playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d he protested, \u201cI was just kidding. I\u2019m winning, or I was until just now, but I need another dollar. Hurry, I gotta get back before someone else gets the machine.\u201d</p><p>Luckily the pizza parlor wasn\u2019t overly crowded, although a handful of kids had gathered around a row of video games against the back wall. Jody didn\u2019t know how they could play at all with the lights so dim.</p><p>\u201cJust a little while longer,\u201d Jody said, rummaging through her purse for yet another dollar. Timmy\u2019s easy acceptance of this outing with Glen had come as a welcome relief.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d Glen held out a fistful of change to her son. \u201cTake what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll these?\u201d Coins spilled over Timmy\u2019s small hands. His eyes were round with disbelief as he hurriedly pocketed the change. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Thanks, Glen,\u201d he said, walking backward. He turned abruptly, eager to get back to his prize machine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s such a good idea,\u201d Jody felt obliged to say. She didn\u2019t want Glen to spoil Timmy, especially if they were to continue seeing each other. Her son might come to look upon Glen as his own personal Santa Claus.</p><p>\u201cI have an ulterior motive,\u201d Glen told her, his eyes brimming with a smile. \u201cIf Timmy\u2019s busy with the video machines, we\u2019ll have a chance to talk.\u201d</p> <p>Jody already guessed as much, but was uncomfortable having him say it out loud. Agreeing to this outing had been an enormous decision for her.</p><p>She\u2019d been afraid to accept, but more afraid not to. Afraid of what she was becoming, afraid of what she already was. She\u2019d stood in one place for so long she feared she\u2019d rooted there like the flower garden she so carefully tended. Bit by bit, Glen was urging her forward. Each step was agony. Each step momentous.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been so bad, now, has it?\u201d Glen asked, coaxing her into admitting the truth. Even that didn\u2019t come easy.</p><p>\u201cIt has been fun,\u201d she agreed. Timmy had certainly enjoyed himself, downing an amazing five pieces of sausage and pepperoni pizza and a huge cola. Jody didn\u2019t know where he managed to put it all. Generally when they ordered a medium-size pizza it was enough for two meals.</p><p>\u201cWould you feel comfortable enough to go out with me again?\u201d Glen asked, and his eyes held hers steadily until she couldn\u2019t bear it any longer and looked away.</p><p>Glen was pressing his advantage and deliberately pushing her, forcing her to stretch her boundaries. This was only the beginning, she realized with a hundred forming regrets. From here on out it would only get more difficult, more threatening.</p><p>It certainly wasn\u2019t going to get any easier. Soon Glen would want to hold her and kiss her, and if she continued to date him, he\u2019d consider it a natural conclusion to their spending time together.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t made any secret of what he was after. He wanted a wife and a family, and he\u2019d said so from the first. Part of her attraction was her son. Glen and Timmy got along like gang busters. Glen was literally the answer to her son\u2019s prayer. That was the crux of the problem. Jody wasn\u2019t dating Glen for herself, but for her son. Now she had to learn to do so for herself.</p> <p>\u201cI was able to get two tickets to The Nutcracker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Nutcracker?\u201d Jody repeated, her voice no more than a breath of sound. The ballet was performed each December by the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and was said to be both charming and brilliant. For years Jody had heard how captivating the costumes and music were. Everyone she\u2019d ever known who\u2019d attended had come away filled with the Christmas spirit. Since Jeff\u2019s death, Christmas had been a season to endure, not one to enjoy. Something told her this year it would be different.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for this Thursday night. I realize it\u2019s a week night, but I was lucky to get those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d The temptation was strong, stronger than she expected. \u201cI\u2019m honored that you\u2019d ask me,\u201d she said, hedging, trying to decide if she should continue this relationship.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll come?\u201d</p><p>A tension-filled minute passed before she agreed with a short nod of her head.</p><p>Jody watched the play of glad emotions on Glen\u2019s face, watched how he struggled to disguise his excitement, and in that moment she realized she\u2019d crossed the line.</p><p>This was the beginning for them.</p><p>Everything else that had led up to this moment had been a prelude of what was to come. The time was right. It had been for a good long while, but she\u2019d been too stubborn to accept it. As odd as it sounded, she was too comfortable in her grief to recognize what was happening.</p><p>There was no turning back now. Any qualms she experienced would need to be met head-on, one at a time.</p><p>Glen must have realized how momentous her decision was because he reached across the table for her hand, squeezing her fingers. \u201cYou won\u2019t regret this,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you want to go out with me,\u201d she said, her voice small and trembling. She bit into her bottom lip in an effort to keep it still.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand?\u201d Glen frowned as if dumbfounded by the question. \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful woman, a woman of character and strength. Every time I\u2019m with you I\u2019m struck by your courage.\u201d</p><p>Jody laughed nervously. \u201cThen why am I frightened out of my wits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is all so new, but I\u2019m not going to push you into anything you don\u2019t want. Oh, I\u2019ll prod and poke and nudge you along from time to time, but you have my word, I won\u2019t rush you into anything you don\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Timmy\u2019s voice echoed across the room sounding as though it came from the bottom of a tin drum. He raced back to the table, skidding to a stop. \u201cWhen are we going to get our Christmas tree? I was talking to George, he\u2019s the kid who showed me how to beat Laser Man, and his family\u2019s already got theirs, and you know what? They went to this farm, but this isn\u2019t the kind with cows and pigs, this is a farm with Christmas trees. And guess what?\u201d he asked, dragging in a deep breath. \u201cThey cut it down themselves. We could do that, couldn\u2019t we, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d Jody wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d manage chopping down a tree, but she was up to the challenge. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can find out about the tree farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where there\u2019s one,\u201d Glen volunteered. \u201cIt\u2019s a ways north, but if you wanted, the three of us could make a day of it. We\u2019ll leave early Saturday morning, get the tree, and then decorate it in the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d Timmy said, so pleased he could barely stand still.</p><p>\u201cHow does that sound to you?\u201d Glen asked, looking expectantly at her. What else could she say? Little by little Glen was easing his way into their lives. Jody was uneasy with that, and at the same time eager.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>Glen\u2019s eyes met hers and a slow, satisfied smile started to form.</p><p>Monica\u2019s fingers bounced against the keyboard like clumps of hail hitting the sidewalk. Her hands kept pace with her thoughts, which sped at a record hundred words or more a minute.</p><p>She\u2019d been stunned by what Chet had said to her. So shocked she hadn\u2019t had time to react. Not then. Reaction had set in later that evening as she rode the bus home. She\u2019d tossed and turned most of the night, her indignation scaling previously unreached thresholds of fury.</p><p>Chet Costello was everything she\u2019d originally assumed. He was much worse than she, in her innocence, had suspected. Egotistical, untrustworthy, why, the man was a blight on decency.</p><p>He\u2019d planned to seduce her, to break down her defenses and use her body for his own selfish satisfaction. As if she\u2019d have allowed such a thing! As soon as he realized she would have nothing more to do with him, he couldn\u2019t be rid of her fast enough. Without a qualm he\u2019d cast her aside like so much dirty laundry.</p><p>The one glitch in his plan was that he hadn\u2019t expected her to be a virgin. As if she were the kind of woman who\u2019d fall into bed with him! And to think she\u2019d actually been\u2014it pained her to admit this\u2014attracted to that scoundrel.</p><p>Thank heaven her father was away for the morning. To think she\u2019d actually toyed with the idea of introducing Chet to her father, of bringing him into their family home. That would have been a disaster. Her father had always been an excellent judge of character and he would have seen through Chet in an instant.</p><p>Monica drew in a deep, wobbly breath as her resentment flared bright and then slowly burned itself out. She covered her face with both hands and attempted to pull herself together, which was difficult when she was shaking so badly.</p><p>After several moments had passed, Monica straightened, grabbed the sheet from the printer, and crumpled it. Having vented her feelings, there was no need to mail the letter. Any further communication between them whatsoever was completely unnecessary. Her hand automatically reached for the mustard-seed necklace dangling from her neck, fingering it. She\u2019d worn the piece every day since Chet had bought it for her, until it had become habit.</p><p>Chet had made his views on life plain. If anything she should be grateful that he\u2019d put an end to this madness when he had. One small part of her, however, refused to conform. One small rebellious corner of her soul yearned for the discoveries he would have shown her.</p><p>The thought terrified Monica into accepting how far she\u2019d slid toward sin.</p><p>Well, she was safe. He was out of her life now. Good riddance was all she could say.</p><p>A knock came softly from the outer door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she snapped, then realized she sounded like an old shrew, and said it again, softer this time. Church secretaries weren\u2019t supposed to be confrontational.</p><p>Michael opened the door and stepped inside. \u201cHello, Monica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, tossing the crumpled-up letter into the wastebasket.</p><p>\u201cYour father said I\u2019d find you here.\u201d He stepped into the office, his stance doubtful. His gaze hesitantly met hers as if he were unsure of himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked, working hard to keep the impatience out of her voice. All she needed now was for him to load her down with extra work. Having wasted a good portion of the morning writing Chet and telling him exactly what she thought of him left her with a backlog of unfinished church business. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI realize it\u2019s short notice but I\u2019d like to take you to lunch, that is, if you\u2019d let me.\u201d</p><p>The invitation was so unexpected that she didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cLunch?\u201d She had to look at her watch to check the time. The morning had sped past on the wings of her aggravation. \u201cI suppose that would be all right,\u201d she said without much enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d His eyes lit up and she realized what nice eyes Michael had. He loved his music and had done wonders for the church choir. It was because of his efforts that the small band had formed. He\u2019d volunteered several hours a week to church work.</p><p>Monica liked Michael. She\u2019d always liked him\u2014there wasn\u2019t anything to dislike about the young man. He was godly, principled, and sincere. Everything she should want in a man.</p> <p>But didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIf you have no objection I thought we\u2019d go to the House of Pancakes. They serve a decent lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The House of Pancakes. That was the problem. Michael was a wonderful man, God\u2019s own servant. Humble, gentle, the perfect choice of a mate for a preacher\u2019s daughter, only . . . only she\u2019d dined on pancakes most of her life and she was ready for some salsa.</p><p>There\u2019d been a trace of hot sauce in Patrick. That was what attracted her to Chet, she realized now. He\u2019d been daring and fun and he\u2019d made her laugh. He\u2019d also badly wounded her pride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get your jacket for you,\u201d Michael offered. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to a catch a chill.\u201d He took her navy blue wool coat from the rack and held it open for her.</p> <p>Michael was a gentleman and Chet was a rogue. If she had a lick of sense, she\u2019d cultivate the relationship with Michael and thank God there were still men like him in this sick and decaying world.</p><p>Since the House of Pancakes was only two blocks away, they decided to walk. Monica buried her hands in her pockets and struggled to keep her attention on what Michael was saying. His voice was a low monotone and she had trouble concentrating.</p><p>A car drove past, the same sick green color of Chet\u2019s Impala, and she whirled around, wondering if it could possibly be him. Her heart leaped into double time at the prospect.</p><p>If it was Chet, it would do him good to see her with another man. If he\u2019d come to apologize, as well he should, then she would accept nothing less than his pleading for forgiveness.</p><p>She held her head high, refusing to allow him to think he\u2019d left her floundering in the wake of his crass behavior. But the sight of the car had been fleeting and she couldn\u2019t be entirely sure it was him. More than likely it wasn\u2019t. Men like Chet Costello didn\u2019t know how to apologize.</p><p>It was Andrew\u2019s night out with his friends, and Leah schlepped into the living room, carrying a book and a cup of coffee. The house was lonely without her husband. Empty. The contrast between her life and that of Pam, who struggled to squeeze in a few moments for herself, struck Leah once more.</p> <p>What she needed was a hobby, Leah decided. Something that would take her mind off the fact that she didn\u2019t have a child. Something that would occupy her time so she didn\u2019t dwell on how hollow her life was. Perhaps she should do volunteer work. There were any number of worthy causes that would welcome her attention.</p><p>Maybe when the holidays were over, she decided.</p><p>She read the first chapter without much enthusiasm. Finally, she put the book down and wandered into the kitchen for a refill on her coffee and stopped abruptly in front of the sink. In the bay window she\u2019d arranged a row of cacti she\u2019d carefully nurtured over the years. Andrew teased her that if she forgot to water them, it wouldn\u2019t matter. Five thick pink-and-turquoise pots each held a different variety of cactus, and each one had sprouted a flower.</p><p>In the last hour.</p><p>A variety of pink, red, and white blossoms had appeared as if by some miracle from the time she\u2019d finished the dishes and wandered into the living room, until now, no more than an hour later. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t notice. One might have gone undetected, but not five. She could have sworn not a single one had been blooming an hour earlier.</p><p>Unexpected tears pooled in her eyes, the moisture hot and unwelcome. She brushed them away from her cheeks with the back of her hand. \u201cIt seems everything in this house is fertile except me,\u201d she murmured aloud, and headed blindly toward the living room to await her husband\u2019s return.</p><p>Sitting on the kitchen counter, her knees crossed, her foot swaying like a too-fast pendulum, Mercy heaved a gigantic sigh. Getting those flowers to appear hadn\u2019t been an easy trick. She would have preferred African violets any day of the week over cacti!</p><p>Everything she\u2019d done for Leah had backfired. The flowers were supposed to be a sign of hope. A way of telling her that all was not lost and that there was someone out there who\u2019d heard her prayer and was working hard to see that it was answered. Well, it was back to the drawing board.</p> <p>Perhaps what Shirley had suggested about Leah experiencing joy before she could find her peace was what it would take. First Mercy had to figure out a way to manage that, but if she could coax cacti into bloom, then anything was possible. Right?</p><p>\u201cShirley.\u201d Goodness shot across the darkened family room of Jody and Timmy Potter\u2019s house in a vapor of speed and excitement. \u201cGive me five,\u201d she cried, holding up her right hand for the other angel to slap. What a difference a few earth hours could make. For the first time since Goodness had accepted this assignment she was making progress. Real progress. Monica and Michael had gone to lunch together. It wasn\u2019t much but it was a start in the right direction.</p><p>\u201cOh, do be quiet,\u201d Shirley whispered heatedly. \u201cYou know better than to be exuberant when there\u2019re children around. Timmy might very well hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve got great news. Monica and Michael had lunch together and I arranged the whole thing without them suspecting. I tell you it was a work of art the way I got Michael to show up at the church office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease keep your voice down,\u201d Shirley pleaded a second time, placing her finger against her lips.</p><p>\u201cAll right. All right, I\u2019ll do my best, but this news is too good to keep to myself.\u201d</p><p>Shirley whirled around so unexpectedly that Goodness was caught by surprise. A sleepy Timmy Potter wandered into the room, rubbing his eyes. He was wearing flannel pajamas with silly-looking armed turtles.</p><p>Shirley moved behind him.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Timmy called.</p><p>A moment later Jody Potter appeared in a long flannel nightgown that had seen better years. Shirley had her work cut out for her if she planned to find this woman a husband any time soon. Her charge looked downright frumpy.</p><p>\u201cTimmy, what are you doing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard something.\u201d</p><p>Jody turned on the light and searched the room. The minute her back was turned, Shirley and Goodness righted the floral arrangement and set the magazines in order. Both headed straight for the ceiling, hovering there.</p><p>Jody searched the room, finding nothing out of the ordinary. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard something,\u201d Timmy said with a yawn. \u201cBut I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not, too,\u201d Jody said, placing her arm around her young son\u2019s shoulders and steering him back to his bedroom. \u201cUnless, of course, it was God\u2019s own angels looking down and smiling on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it might have been?\u201d Timmy asked excitedly, looking up. He paused and blinked, rubbed his eyes again, then looked back.</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d Jody said and turned out the light.</p><p>Monica\u2019s attitude toward Chet altered drastically over the next couple of days. He was still a scoundrel and a no-good rogue, but darned if she didn\u2019t miss him. There was no explaining it, no possible way of reasoning it out in her mind.</p><p>She tried to fill the emptiness that surrounded her with a flurry of activity. The night before she\u2019d dragged out the Christmas decorations and gone about setting them around the house and office. Her father, impressed by her initiative, assumed this burst of energy was somehow connected with her long lunch with Michael. Monica didn\u2019t correct him.</p><p>Monica knew she wouldn\u2019t see Chet again and wondered if he missed her. She wondered how he looked upon their time together or if he\u2019d given her as much as a fleeting thought in the days since they\u2019d last been together.</p><p>She wore her hair down that morning and when she walked into the kitchen her father lowered the morning paper and smiled gently at her.</p><p>\u201cMonica,\u201d he said softly, \u201chow nice you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be seeing Michael again this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d How keen her father was on the young musician. He\u2019d pegged Michael early on as the perfect husband for her. He was right. Her father generally was. How she wished she felt the same way about the earnest choir director. There was no question of what a fine man Michael was. Several of the eligible women at church would have gladly welcomed his notice. For now those attentions were sadly wasted on her.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me I said something to Michael about coming over for dinner one night soon. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Michael is welcome anytime.\u201d So this was to be the way of it. Her father would chart her romance for her, making excuses for the two of them to be together again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll approve of the way you\u2019ve done your hair,\u201d he added, looking pleased.</p><p>She smiled weakly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a few minutes,\u201d she said, anxious to escape their conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving for the office so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . have several things I need to do first thing this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be in until later. I\u2019m visiting Mrs. McWilliams,\u201d he reminded her, downing the last of his milk and setting the glass in the sink.</p><p>The woman was an old and faithful church member who\u2019d recently broken her hip. Lloyd visited her at least twice a week.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, then,\u201d Monica said, eager to make her escape. She walked across the yard to the old church building and let herself in by the side door that opened onto the sanctuary area. She\u2019d been raised in this building, lived the majority of her life in the same house with the same people.</p><p>Instead of heading directly to the office, which was situated in the room at the rear of the church off the foyer, Monica paused and looked toward the altar. An unspoken prayer rose in her throat and she found herself moving toward the altar rail.</p><p>Monica kelt there and slowly bowed her head. \u201cGuide his life, Father,\u201d she whispered. The tears that filled her eyes came as a surprise and the remainder of the words were choked off in her throat. She wasn\u2019t sure how to pray for Chet. But God knew and she\u2019d leave the man and the matter in His capable hands.</p><p>Several moments passed before she stood.</p><p>Her morning slipped past almost unnoticed. Typing was something of a chore with her hair continually falling in her face. It irritated her so much that she found two bobby pins in a desk drawer and clipped both sides behind her ears.</p><p>She was busy working on the bulletin for Sunday morning worship service when the door opened. Monica looked up from the computer and her pulse quickened. Quickened was a mild way of explaining what happened to her. Her heart was banging against her ribs with such force she wasn\u2019t able to do anything more than breathe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see you took my advice about your hairstyle,\u201d Chet said, and sauntered into the office as if he were right at home.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She glanced anxiously toward her father\u2019s office, forgetting he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s off visiting Mrs. McWilliams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow . . . how do you know that?\u201d</p> <p>Chet laughed lightly and rearranged the figurines that made up the nativity scene she\u2019d set in a froth of angel hair, switching the camels and the mules. \u201cI know just about everything there is to know about you.\u201d</p><p>Playing a game of cat and mouse with him was beyond her. Chet was much too clever for her. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see you. Why else? I\u2019m not exactly the type of guy who frequents churches.\u201d</p><p>She was on her feet without knowing how she got there. Clenching her hands together in front of her, she drew in a steadying breath. \u201cWhy do you want to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured I owed you an apology.\u201d</p> <p>His willingness to admit it surprised her. \u201cThen I accept your regrets,\u201d she informed him, sitting back down. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to trouble yourself further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came for another reason,\u201d he said, easing himself onto the corner of her desk as if he had every right to do so.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Monica placed her hands on the keyboard, ready to resume her task although heaven knew she couldn\u2019t have typed had her life depended on it.</p><p>\u201cYou planning on seeing that milquetoast choir director again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s any concern of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but if you do, you\u2019re cheating him and you\u2019re hurting yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Monica had taken about as much of his advice as she could tolerate. \u201cWhat gives you the right to say those kinds of things to me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI know you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She hated it when he called her that and he knew it. He was purposely trying to irritate her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got fire in your blood, not milk. You\u2019ve sampled desire. Now that you know what it is to be weak with wanting a man, you won\u2019t be able to accept second best. Not anymore\u2014it\u2019s too late for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he agreed readily enough, \u201cI do.\u201d He stood and walked around to her side of the desk.</p><p>Monica watched him, not knowing what to expect. Every nerve was at full attention. A siren was blaring in her head, blocking out all sensible thought.</p><p>When he reached for her, she didn\u2019t offer the least bit of resistance. As it never failed to do, his touch rippled through her, snapping her senses to life. He roughly lowered his mouth to hers where he planted desperate, hungry kisses.</p> <p>She resisted him at first, attempting to jerk her mouth from his, but he wouldn\u2019t allow it, trapping her face. Her stand against him was pitifully weak, and soon she was as much a participant in the exchange as he was.</p><p>Slowly he eased himself away from her. \u201cHeaven help me,\u201d he whispered and Monica was convinced he didn\u2019t mean this as a prayer.</p><p>Something attracted his attention and he jerked his head around. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Monica was too startled to do anything.</p><p>\u201cWhoever it is, get rid of them,\u201d he instructed, slipping behind the door that led to her father\u2019s office.</p><p>Get rid of them, Monica thought in panic. She wasn\u2019t accustomed to playing these ridiculous cops-and-robbers games. She hadn\u2019t a clue of what to say or do.</p><p>The door opened just then and Michael strolled inside. He smiled at her warmly. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not catching you at a bad time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad time,\u201d she repeated with a phony laugh. \u201cOf course not. Come on in, Michael.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Pam asked, leading Scotty by the hand into Leah\u2019s house. \u201cAfter all the trouble I\u2019ve gone through for this silly Christmas party of Doug\u2019s, who\u2019d believe my baby-sitter would come down with the flu? At the last minute, no less. It was the oddest thing. One minute she was fine and the next she was sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have brought over Diane and Jason too,\u201d Leah said.</p><p>Pam laughed outright at that. \u201cEven my mother won\u2019t take all three at once.\u201d Flustered and in a rush, she set everything down on the sofa and started unpacking the items she\u2019d brought along for her middle son. Sorting through the brown paper sack, Pam removed Scotty\u2019s pajamas, an extra set of clothes for the morning, his stuffed dinosaur and a tattered yellow blanket. \u201cHe\u2019s mostly given up his blanky, but he might need a bit of security to sleep in an unfamiliar bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure he has it with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought along some extra training pants,\u201d Pam said, setting out a stack of them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wet,\u201d Scotty said, his fists braced against his small hips. \u201cI\u2019m a big boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot his potty seat,\u201d Pam cried. \u201cOh, well, you\u2019ll just have to hold him over the toilet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Scotty and I\u2019ll figure everything out as we go. Isn\u2019t that right, bud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She held out her hand for him to slap, which he did with enthusiasm, his arm making a high arch into the air.</p><p>Pam straightened and held back her hair with both hands. \u201cI hope to heaven that\u2019s everything. Here\u2019s the number where Doug and I\u2019ll be,\u201d she said, pulling a slip of paper from her coat pocket. Getting down on her knees, she wrapped her arms around her three-year-old. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be an extra good boy for Auntie Leah?\u201d</p><p>Scotty clung to her neck and planted a wet kiss on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a great time, aren\u2019t we, Scotty?\u201d Leah urged, knowing how bad Pam felt to be leaving him in an unfamiliar setting.</p><p>Scotty nodded, but looked uncertain when his mother left. Pam was halfway out the front door when she turned back. \u201cHe probably needs to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam,\u201d Leah said, ushering her friend out of the house, \u201cscoot, otherwise you\u2019ll miss your hair appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hurrying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop looking so worried. Everything\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d</p><p>Scotty was standing at the window, his mouth pressed to the cold glass as he watched his mother pull out of the driveway. He looked at Leah and his bottom lip started to tremble.</p><p>\u201cScotty, how about helping me with lunch?\u201d she asked, holding out her hand. \u201cYou can decide what to fix for Uncle Andrew, all right?\u201d</p><p>The boy shook his head, smearing his lip prints from one pane to the next.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Once more Scotty shook his head. \u201cI want my mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going out to dinner with your daddy and his friends from work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis dinner is only for mommies and daddies.\u201d</p><p>Apparently this wasn\u2019t what Scotty wanted to hear because the tears started in earnest. He was breaking her heart, standing with his back to the window, rubbing his eyes and sobbing softly. She couldn\u2019t bear to see her godson weeping so pitifully, so she lifted him into her arms to comfort him. Scotty buried his face in her shoulder, snuffling into her expensive cashmere sweater. Leah smiled to herself and shook her head. This was what it meant to be a mother, to be loved and needed. She\u2019d treasure every moment of the time with this precious little boy.</p><p>It took Leah only a few moments to get Scotty interested in helping her assemble sandwiches. Andrew arrived about the time the boy was licking the jelly off the knife and sticking it back inside the jar.</p><p>\u201cSo we have company,\u201d he said, removing his jacket and hanging it on the peg just inside the door.</p><p>Scotty looked at her husband as an unknown entity, his big dark eyes following Andrew\u2019s movements around the kitchen as Leah explained Pam\u2019s sorry predicament.</p><p>\u201cPeanut butter and jelly?\u201d Andrew grumbled under his breath, eyeing their lunch.</p><p>\u201cThat was what Scotty wanted us to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure he didn\u2019t suggest pastrami on rye?\u201d Andrew mumbled out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cScotty made the peanut butter and jelly all by himself,\u201d Leah said, urging her husband to compliment the boy on his efforts. There was more peanut butter on the countertop than the bread, but Scotty had done it himself and beamed with pride.</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed.\u201d Andrew skeptically lifted one corner of the bread. The peanut butter was spread so thin the white bread showed through. He looked at Leah and they both burst into laughter. It wasn\u2019t especially funny, but they seemed to find it so.</p><p>Scotty studied them as if he didn\u2019t know what to make of the two. Leah kissed his chubby cheek and set the sandwich and a small glass of milk down on the table. Moving out the chair, Scotty climbed onto the seat. He knelt on the cushion and leaned against the glass tabletop, his small hands circling the glass.</p><p>\u201cApparently lunch is served,\u201d Andrew said, bowing and gallantly gesturing for Leah to take her place at the table. He held out the chair for her, then seated himself.</p><p>After sampling the sandwich, Andrew eyed Leah. \u201cIs Scotty choosing the dinner menu as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot dogs and macaroni and cheese,\u201d Scotty said with his mouth full of food.</p><p>Andrew looked at Leah and there was something so crestfallen in his eyes that she couldn\u2019t help it, she burst out laughing. Andrew didn\u2019t know what she found so funny, but soon he was laughing too. Scotty, who hadn\u2019t a clue of what was going on, joined in, milk dribbling out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Mercy looked down upon the scene from where she was lounging on top of the double-wide refrigerator. Her scheme had worked beautifully, although she did feel mildly guilty about inflicting Pam\u2019s baby-sitter with the virus.</p><p>Scotty\u2019s visit with Leah and Andrew was going much better than she\u2019d anticipated. So well that it was all Mercy could do not to stand up and cheer. The sound of Leah and Andrew\u2019s laughter brightened the room like floodlights on an empty stage.</p><p>The kitchen radiated with the warmth of their happiness. The dim, dark pall of melancholy faded as the joy was slowly released, circling the room with tails of light. The gloom, discouragement, and despair that marked this house lifted like dissipating fog over the Golden Gate Bridge revealing the sound structure of this marriage, and the deep, profound love Leah and Andrew shared.</p><p>This was what Mercy had waited for so impatiently.</p><p>Joy.</p><p>Her gaze wandered closely over Leah and the emotion she read in the young woman\u2019s face deeply stirred her soul. At last they were making progress. The light was on, the mist had lifted.</p><p>It was a beginning.</p><p>The lunch was over and Leah lifted Scotty from the chair, washed his hands and face, and carried him into the guest bedroom. Knowing his penchant for amusing himself instead of napping, she sat in the rocking chair and held him in her lap. Scotty chose a book and she read to him until he dozed off.</p><p>For a long time after Scotty was asleep, Leah continued to hold him, enjoying these rare moments of peace and the ecstasy of having a child in her arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kissing the top of his curly head, she was amazed at all Pam managed to do with a houseful of preschoolers. Scotty had only been with her a couple of hours and already she was emotionally and physically exhausted.</p><p>Andrew arrived just then, leaning indolently against the door frame, his face wide with a saucy grin. \u201cIt looks like you could use a nap yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever told me toddlers could be so exhausting,\u201d Leah admitted.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Andrew whispered, gently lifting Scotty from her arms. \u201cLet\u2019s put him to bed.\u201d</p> <p>Moving around her husband, Leah turned back the sheets and Andrew carefully laid the sleeping child onto the mattress. Covering him with the quilt, Leah bent down and kissed her godson\u2019s forehead.</p><p>Neither Andrew nor Leah were in any hurry to leave the room. Standing next to her husband, she nestled in the warm security of Andrew\u2019s arms, her head resting against the solid wall of his chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really something, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Andrew said softly, so as not to disturb Scotty\u2019s sleep.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a ball of energy.\u201d</p><p>Andrew kissed the side of her neck. \u201cCome on, I think we could do with a nap ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>From the way he made the suggestion, Leah knew resting was the last thing on her husband\u2019s mind. She caught his eye, and whispered regretfully, \u201cAndrew, we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotty might wake and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Doug and Pam worry about that? Besides, I can be real quiet, and with some effort so can you,\u201d he whispered, steering her toward their bedroom.</p><p>Sometime later, Leah woke to the sounds of someone hopping up and down at the foot of her bed. She rolled onto her back to find Scotty doing a marvelous impression of a kangaroo.</p><p>\u201cHi, Scotty.\u201d</p> <p>He was holding onto his front with both hands, his eyes wide and appealing.</p><p>\u201cScotty?\u201d she asked, sitting up, clenching the sheets to her breasts. \u201cDo you need to go potty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my guess,\u201d Andrew said, yawning. \u201cCome on, fellow, I\u2019ll show you the way.\u201d Lifting the boy into his arms, Andrew carried him to the bathroom.</p><p>Leah grabbed her sweater and finished dressing. \u201cHow\u2019s everything going in there?\u201d she called out.</p><p>\u201cNot good. He seems to need something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Scotty apparently didn\u2019t trust Andrew to properly relay the message. \u201cI need my blanky . . . I need my blanky . . . I need my blanky.\u201d</p><p>Leah retrieved the yellow monstrosity in record time and rushed back into the bathroom where Andrew was holding Scotty over the toilet seat. The boy grabbed the blanket, and held it against his face. As soon as the blanket was in position, he released a long, grateful sigh and relaxed.</p> <p>When Scotty finished, Andrew sagged onto the side of the bathtub. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam said something about forgetting his toilet seat. He must have been terrified of being perched up there.\u201d</p><p>Andrew looked at Leah and she looked at him and soon the two of them dissolved into giggles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big boy,\u201d Scotty insisted, looking downright proud of himself, his laughter mingling with theirs.</p><p>Monica was convinced Michael would guess that Chet was hiding behind the door in the other room. Why Chet felt he needed to disappear, she could only speculate.</p><p>The man was a fool to show up at the church this way. She\u2019d wanted to shout at him, and throw the entire contents of her filing cabinet in his face. Heaven knew he deserved that and far worse. Why, she should have slapped him silly.</p><p>She would have, too, if she hadn\u2019t been so pleased to see him.</p><p>\u201cYour hair looks especially nice today,\u201d Michael said with glowing approval.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Knowing Chet, it was probably all he could do to keep from leaping out from behind the door and commenting that he\u2019d been the one to suggest the change.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m playing the piano for the Methodists\u2019 church cantata this evening,\u201d Michael was saying. \u201cTheir regular pianist came down with the flu. I thought I\u2019d stop by and see if you\u2019d like to come along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d Monica asked, stalling for time. In truth she was looking for an excuse, anything to get out of this date, but nothing readily presented itself.</p><p>\u201cI mentioned this evening to your father and he said you didn\u2019t have anything planned,\u201d Michael pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe I do.\u201d So her father had put him up to this. She should have realized that sooner.</p><p>Michael hesitated, glancing at her as if he were waiting for her to say something more. Uncertain, Monica steadily met his look.</p><p>\u201cDid Lloyd mention anything about dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d She knew she was beginning to sound like a parrot. \u201cWhy, yes. Dad did say something this morning about having you over for dinner some evening. We\u2019d be more than happy to have you join us, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight . . . why, sure . . . tonight would be perfect, wouldn\u2019t it, since I\u2019ll be there for the Methodists\u2019 cantata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d she said automatically, willing to agree to anything that would convince him to leave faster. Knowing Chet was listening in on the conversation made matters ten times worse.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Michael said, looking well pleased with himself, \u201cI\u2019ll see you around six, then. Would you like me to bring anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Everything\u2019s under control. Good-bye, Michael,\u201d she said, sitting back down at the computer, hoping he\u2019d take the hint and kindly leave while her sanity was intact. She placed her hands on the keyboard until she noticed how badly she was trembling and immediately lowered them to her lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to this evening,\u201d he said, reluctantly moving toward the door. He was looking for an excuse to stay, but she refused to give him one.</p><p>Despite her obvious signs of distress, she tried to concentrate on the computer screen.</p><p>\u201cYour father claims you\u2019re a fabulous cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do a fair job,\u201d she muttered. This was getting worse every minute and she didn\u2019t know how much more she could bear.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Michael,\u201d she said, closing her eyes in relief.</p><p>Michael left then and the door closed with a soft clicking sound. The instant he was gone, Monica leaped out of her chair, raced around her desk and into her father\u2019s study. By the time she arrived she was both breathless and furious.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you hide?\u201d she demanded. \u201cOf all the crazy things you\u2019ve said and done in the last few weeks, this takes the cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have required awkward explanations,\u201d was all he\u2019d say.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d A frown darkened Chet\u2019s face and he glared at her. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to continue seeing him despite what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat choice did I have?\u201d she cried, throwing her arms into the air. \u201cI said what I had to, to get him to leave. Besides, what business is it of yours who I do or do not date?\u201d How could he say such things to her when he was the one who\u2019d put her in this predicament!</p><p>It took him a long time to answer. \u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s none of my damn business.\u201d</p><p>Monica was pleased that Chet did care, but she didn\u2019t want him to know it.</p><p>\u201cMichael\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s plain as day that he\u2019s crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>The man was full of surprises. First he demanded that she stay away from Michael and now he was urging her to see the other man.</p><p>Chet\u2019s eyes were clouded as if he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders. \u201cI should never have come.\u201d</p><p>He strode past her and in her heart Monica knew if he walked out the door she\u2019d never see him again. She had to do something.</p><p>He was all the way across the room, his hand on the doorknob, before she found the courage to speak. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d She advanced a single step toward him and stopped.</p><p>Chet turned around slowly as if he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard her correctly. Gradually a grin danced its way across his lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>Her tongue was trapped against the roof of her mouth and she shook her head, unable to say the words a second time. It had demanded every ounce of courage she possessed the first time.</p><p>His gaze narrowed into thin, disbelieving slits. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart, you can do better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d She backed away from him, as far as she could go, until her buttocks were pressed against the edge of her desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to call you?\u201d</p><p>It was a mistake to have asked him to stay, a mistake to let him know how much of the time he dominated her thoughts. He made her weak where she\u2019d once been strong, and she\u2019d found no compensation for what she\u2019d lost.</p><p>\u201cI think you should go,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He cocked his thick brows at that. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to know what you want, do you? You want me to stay, yet you invite that mild-mannered choirboy for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father invited him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, your father,\u201d Chet said thoughtfully. \u201cMichael\u2019s the type of man he wants you to marry, isn\u2019t he? We both know what your daddy would think of the likes of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. My father isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cHe\u2019d welcome me with open arms. Don\u2019t kid yourself, Monica, we both know better. Listen, sweetheart, forget I was ever here, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I won\u2019t forget,\u201d she whispered heatedly. \u201cI can\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>She read the questions etched in his eyes and realized they were a reflection of her own. She didn\u2019t have any of the answers and apparently neither did he.</p><p>Walking toward him was the boldest thing she\u2019d ever done in her life. Flattening her palms against the hard expanse of his chest, she slowly, reluctantly raised her eyes to his.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a chance to speak. His mouth came down on hers in a kiss that was as hot as it was wild. Instinct dictated her actions as she raised her arms and looped them around his neck, giving herself completely to his kiss.</p><p>His arms folded around her waist, greedily holding her against him as his mouth plundered hers. Her feet dangled several inches off the ground.</p><p>The kiss ended only when they were both desperate to breathe.</p><p>Monica was left stunned, her heart in a panic. It had always been like this between them, this craziness. Her head felt as if it were in its own orbit, spinning madly out of control. Emotionally she was a wreck, close to tears and trembling.</p><p>Chet\u2019s lips returned to hers in a series of long, slow kisses and her world righted itself. Everything slipped neatly back into place. Only when she lifted her head from his did outside influences overtake her.</p><p>For the love of heaven, they were in a church building, and yet she couldn\u2019t have left his arms in that moment for all the gold in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d Chet whispered against her neck. He drew in a deep breath as if that would give him the necessary fortitude to ease her out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>The sound of voices in the yard outside was all the incentive they needed. They broke apart as if they\u2019d been burned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my father,\u201d Monica said, her gaze flying to Chet.</p> <p>Chet jerked his head both ways. \u201cI\u2019ll go out the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>By the time she reached him in her father\u2019s office, he\u2019d hoisted the window open and had one leg draped over the sill. \u201cMeet me tonight,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she pleaded, glancing over her shoulder. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered frantically. \u201cTell me when and where.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and the look in his eyes was enough to cause spirals of heat to coil in her belly. He reached for her, kissed her once hard and fast and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d With that he vanished.</p><p>The door opened and her father casually strolled inside, humming softly to himself. He looked surprised to find her standing there.</p><p>\u201cMonica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad?\u201d she said, still trapped in a sensual daze.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to close the window. It\u2019s downright chilly in here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she said, lowering it as if it were nothing out of the ordinary to have it open in the middle of December.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open the door for you,\u201d Timmy cried, running toward the front porch, leaving Glen to untie the Christmas tree from the top of his car.</p><p>\u201cTimmy has his own key,\u201d Jody explained, catching the rope that Glen tossed down to her as he untied the tree.</p><p>Glen looked toward the front of the house. \u201cHe enjoyed himself this afternoon, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Jody smiled and nodded. \u201cI swear he was like a jackrabbit, leaping from one tree to the next, certain each time he\u2019d found the perfect Christmas tree. It\u2019s a miracle we were able to convince him to choose just one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Jody?\u201d Glen asked thoughtfully. \u201cDid you have a good time too?\u201d</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t be so difficult to admit to the truth, but it was.</p><p>\u201cI had a very nice time,\u201d she said, keeping her eyes averted.</p> <p>His laugh came unexpectedly. \u201cGood girl,\u201d he praised. \u201cI knew you could do it.\u201d</p><p>Jody laughed then too, because it was rather silly of her to hold out against the obvious.</p><p>Timmy returned breathless and excited. \u201cThe door\u2019s open,\u201d he announced, eager to help in any way he could.</p><p>Her son was a marvel, Jody mused. Rarely had she seen him more animated. He\u2019d laughed and chatted incessantly, until she was convinced he was going to drive Glen nuts. For a man who wasn\u2019t accustomed to being around children, the attorney had been marvelous.</p><p>\u201cMom got the tree stand and all the decorations out last night,\u201d Timmy told Glen, for about the fifth time. Actually Jody had lost count of the number of times Timmy had felt it was necessary to clue Glen in to this information.</p><p>Together, the three of them carried the Christmas tree around to the backyard.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to cut off a couple of inches from the bottom,\u201d Glen said, once they\u2019d got the tree to the patio and recovered. The trunk was too wide for the stand. \u201cThink you might be able to help me saw it off?\u201d he asked Timmy.</p><p>It was like asking the boy if he liked popcorn. Timmy beamed with pride as he solemnly nodded his head. \u201cSure, I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can,\u201d Glen said, affectionately patting his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re busy with that, I\u2019ll put on some hot chocolate,\u201d Jody said, pushing open the sliding glass door. The tears that stung her eyes were unexpected. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure what prompted them, nor was she sure she wanted to know.</p><p>The changes in Timmy had been revealing. Yes, it was Christmastime and yes, he was excited, but it made her realize how rare those times were. Generally Timmy involved himself in his video games and didn\u2019t show much enthusiasm for anything else\u2014with the one exception being baseball, which he dearly loved.</p><p>Between sniffles, she brought the milk out of the refrigerator and set a pan on the stove, furious with herself for the weakness of tears.</p><p>Glen appeared unexpectedly and she twisted her head away, praying he wouldn\u2019t notice. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a boy you\u2019ve got there,\u201d Glen said. \u201cI swear he\u2019s another Paul Bunyan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s certainly had the time of his life.\u201d She was grateful that the hot chocolate gave her an excuse to keep her back to him.</p><p>Glen moved behind her and gently placed his hands on her shoulders. Jody froze, unaccustomed to a man\u2019s touch.</p><p>He bent forward and kissed the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Timmy?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling.</p><p>\u201cPutting the saw away.\u201d Glen turned her so that they faced each other. He frowned when he saw her tear-bright eyes and slid his thumb across the high arch of her cheek. \u201cBad thoughts?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cLet me help.\u201d Then, before she could protest, he lowered his mouth to hers. It was hardly enough pressure to call it a real kiss. Gradually he increased the intensity, deepening the contact. Jody felt like a rag doll, limp and unresponsive. The kiss was sweet and undemanding, but Glen was the first man to touch her since Jeff. Doubts blew against her with hurricane-force winds until she pressed her hands against his chest and broke the contact. Later she\u2019d analyze her feelings toward Glen, but for now it was too new.</p><p>Glen sighed softly. \u201cIt would be very easy to fall in love with you.\u201d He continued to hold her until he heard Timmy\u2019s approach.</p><p>Once her son was back, Glen carried the tree into the house, and with a good deal of ceremony, set it in the living room. When it was in place in front of the large picture window, they sat back and sipped hot chocolate.</p><p>Unwilling to rest, Timmy sorted through the boxes of decorations. It seemed with every one, he found something he needed to show Glen. Each discovery involved a lengthy explanation.</p><p>Glen\u2019s patience surprised her, and she told him so.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great kid,\u201d Glen said. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we decorate the tree now?\u201d Timmy asked, standing in the middle of three strings of lights. Wires were wrapped around his feet and another strand was draped over his shoulder as he grinned broadly in their direction. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to make me wait until Christmas morning to see my presents, are you? I\u2019m much too old to pretend I believe in Santa Claus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tradition,\u201d Jody said, as means of an argument.</p><p>\u201cOh, phooey. I still have to pretend I believe in that silly kid stuff for my grandma, but it\u2019s downright embarrassing. I just hope none of my friends find out about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes there are things a man has to do,\u201d Glen said, and Jody marveled that he kept a straight face.</p><p>\u201cCan we decorate the tree now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Glen agreed, setting aside his empty mug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be our best tree yet, won\u2019t it, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Jody was saved from answering by the phone. She left the pair to untangle the strings of lights and took the call in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJody, dear, it\u2019s so good to hear your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Gloria.\u201d It had been a year or longer since she\u2019d last spoken to her former mother-in-law. \u201cDid you get my letter?\u201d Jody asked, glancing guiltily into the living room. There wasn\u2019t any reason for her to feel the least bit contrite for dating Glen or for kissing him, but she did, as if she\u2019d been unfaithful to Jeff\u2019s memory.</p><p>\u201cI have some very important news,\u201d Gloria said, ignoring the question.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Timmy wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, Gloria,\u201d Jody said, and placed her hand over the mouthpiece. \u201cIt\u2019s your Grandma Potter,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019ll let you talk to her when I\u2019m finished. I\u2019ll call you in just a minute.\u201d When Timmy was gone, she replaced the receiver at her ear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt you. You were telling me you had something important to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, it\u2019s the most wonderful news. Brace yourself because what I\u2019m about to tell you will come as a shock. Jeff\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Monica paced her bedroom, wondering what, if anything, she should do now that she was home. Her evening with Michael had been miserable. Michael couldn\u2019t be blamed for that; he\u2019d been sweet and considerate, wanting to please her.</p><p>When he\u2019d arrived for dinner, he\u2019d presented her with a potted pink poinsettia, which riddled her with guilt. Throughout the meal he\u2019d praised her efforts while her father looked on approvingly. Monica was a fair cook, but the pot roast and mashed potatoes and gravy were nothing to brag about.</p><p>The cantata, while inspirational, had seemed to drag. Every note was torture and Monica knew why.</p><p>She was looking for Chet, half expecting him to slip into the pew next to her at the Methodist church. It was just like something he\u2019d do. Monica had sat through the entire program with her stomach in knots wondering when and where Chet would show up.</p><p>After she returned home, she wondered if he\u2019d come for her, as he\u2019d said he would, but as the night ripened, she was further burdened with uncertainty.</p><p>Fortunately, her father had gone to bed early. She hadn\u2019t been fooled. Lloyd Fischer was hoping she\u2019d invite Michael in for a cup of coffee and had afforded them the necessary privacy to talk. Monica, however, had made her excuses, thanked Michael for a lovely evening, and then quickly slipped inside the house.</p><p>Waiting for Chet was intolerable. The not knowing. Twice now she\u2019d ventured through the house, turning lights on and off as she tiptoed from one room to the next, fearing she\u2019d wake her father.</p><p>At ten, she sat on the end of her bed, depressed and miserable. She picked at her fingernails, which she kept square and neatly trimmed. Although she\u2019d often admired women with beautifully manicured nails, she personally thought of them as vain. The Bible has a good deal to say about vanity and a good many other things, including . . .</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a soft knocking sound against her bedroom window. Monica flew off the bed and was breathless by the time she boosted open her window and stuck out her head.</p><p>\u201cChet?\u201d she whispered as loud as she dared, leaning out. \u201cIs that you?\u201d She was eternally grateful that her father\u2019s room was at the front of the house, opposite her own.</p><p>\u201cAre you expecting anyone else?\u201d</p><p>She heard Chet, but couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she demanded, squinting into the inky black night. Shadows flickered here and there in what little light the moon offered. Still she couldn\u2019t locate him, and yet he sounded incredibly close.</p><p>He appeared then, like an apparition, and stood directly in front of her. For a moment they did nothing but stare at each other. Monica\u2019s heart was positioned somewhere between her chest and her throat and felt like a concrete ball. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chet\u2019s look was unreadable. This private investigator was superbly talented at hiding his feelings.</p><p>Her own were as plain as a first-grade primer, she was sure of it. She was so pleased to see him it would have been impossible to disguise even a small part of her feelings.</p><p>His eyes darkened with intensity before he framed her face with his hands and gently pressed his mouth to hers. Monica sighed and wrapped her arms around his neck. The upper part of her body was thrust out the window so that her waist was pressed against the sill.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased you came,\u201d she whispered again and again between frantic kisses. Her fingers were in his hair and her mouth was working against his, her need urgent.</p> <p>The power Chet held over her was frightening. Each time they were together a little more of her restraint was stripped away. A little more of her control.</p><p>By the time they broke apart, Monica was gasping and trembling. She was aware of every part of her body his hands had touched. Her face, her shoulders, her neck. She felt a deep, physical hunger that shook her to the core.</p><p>\u201cHow was your date?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head, not wanting to discuss Michael.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy yourself?\u201d he demanded, refusing to allow her to brush off the question. His hands held her face prisoner, and his eyes burned into hers.</p> <p>\u201cI was miserable.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders relaxed and he rewarded her with a shockingly thorough kiss. Before she had time to recover, he hoisted himself inside her bedroom.</p><p>Monica backed away from the window, and sank onto the edge of her mattress, her knees too weak to support her.</p><p>Chet glanced about the starkly furnished room and frowned. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d Where she gathered the strength to refuse him she never knew. She folded her hands in her lap and concentrated on drawing in deep, even breaths. If ever she needed a clear head it was now.</p><p>Chet was pacing the room, restless and agitated. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica, be reasonable. Your father\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the other side of the house. He\u2019s a sound sleeper, he won\u2019t hear anything, and if he does, well, I\u2019m twenty-five years old and if I care to invite a man into our house, then that\u2019s my business.\u201d</p><p>Chet\u2019s smile lacked amusement. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m in your bedroom, and inviting me to stay is a little like inviting the fox into the henhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your place any safer?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly at that. \u201cNo, but it\u2019ll ease my conscience. In the time it takes us to get there I just might find the strength to keep my hands off you. But I doubt it. You\u2019ve got me so tied up in knots, it\u2019s a wonder I\u2019m able to do my job.\u201d</p> <p>Monica wasn\u2019t in any better condition herself. Brushing the hair from her face, she forced herself to think rationally. That, she soon realized, was a mistake. \u201cAs far as I can see we have absolutely nothing in common,\u201d she mumbled under her breath, discouraged and depressed.</p><p>\u201cExcept we\u2019re so damn hot for each other we\u2019re both about to break out in a heat rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA relationship built on physical attraction is doomed from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Chet nodded. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, straightening her spine, searching for the necessary resolve to do the right thing. \u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe logical choice is to bed. It\u2019d help matters tremendously, don\u2019t you think? It\u2019s what any other couple would do in like circumstances. We just might be able to put this foolishness behind us and get on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>His words felt like a cold slap in the face. \u201cThat\u2019s the most ridiculous thing you\u2019ve ever said to me,\u201d Monica managed despite her outrage. \u201cI\u2019m not some bimbo you can use to satisfy your carnal cravings and then toss aside. Dear heaven.\u201d She moaned, covering her face with both hands. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Chet whispered, kneeling down in front of her. He pried her hands away from her face, clasped them in his own and kissed her knuckles. \u201cYou\u2019re right, it was a stupid thing to suggest. I shouldn\u2019t have spoken to you like that.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward she rewarded his honesty with a lengthy kiss, one that gained in intensity and momentum until they were both sprawled across the top of her mattress, their arms and legs entwined.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d he whispered, his voice husky and low. He was struggling for control and for that matter so was she, but it felt so wonderfully good to be in his arms. Better than anything she\u2019d experienced in all her twenty-five years.</p><p>\u201cI better leave,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She ran her tongue along the underside of his jaw, loving the taste of him; the scent of rum-and-spice aftershave enveloped her. She burrowed more completely into his embrace. For a moment she thought he intended to push her away, but instead he released a long, slow sigh and held her tightly against him.</p><p>\u201cMonica . . . Stop,\u201d he muttered between clenched teeth, \u201cotherwise I won\u2019t be held responsible for what happens.\u201d</p><p>Monica smiled to herself, knowing he\u2019d never do anything to hurt her. Where the assurance came from she couldn\u2019t be sure, but she felt it as strongly as she did his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cI knew it would be a mistake to come,\u201d he mumbled, seemingly to himself.</p><p>Monica continued to move her mouth over his throat. Her tongue made small circular movements against his jaw and over his ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire,\u201d he said, his voice stiff with resolve.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cA man can only take so much of this.\u201d The words were barely audible.</p><p>\u201cI know that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for things to go so far,\u201d he whispered. He rolled away from her and changed their positions so that they were lying on their sides, facing each other.</p><p>Monica\u2019s head was cradled in his upper arm, their mouths separated by scant inches. Their breath merged and mingled. Her thigh met his. She was happier than she could remember being in a good long while. Monica would have been utterly content to stay exactly like this for the next hundred years.</p><p>Being here with Chet like this forced her to acknowledge how incredibly lonely she\u2019d been in the last few years. Her mother had died and her friends, the only two she considered good friends, had both married and moved away. Funny she hadn\u2019t realized how empty and pointless her life had become. Nor had she realized what poor company she was to herself and others.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Their eyes met and she found him openly studying her. She quickly averted her gaze. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how downright good a man could feel.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly and kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cThat\u2019s very honest of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t very well deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could, and have,\u201d he said. His fingertips grazed her temple, softly caressing her face. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest too. You feel damn good in my arms. Tonight,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwhile you were with Michael, I was like a caged animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean anything to me,\u201d she rushed to explain.</p><p>He closed his eyes and nodded. \u201cI know, but it didn\u2019t make any difference. There was this band around my chest that tightened every time I thought about the two of you together. Yet I know in my heart Michael\u2019s a better man than I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d she pleaded, feeling the panic rising in her voice. His next suggestion might be that they not see each other again and she couldn\u2019t bear that.</p><p>\u201cMonica, listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, don\u2019t say it. I have an idea.\u201d The words rushed out on top of each other.</p><p>\u201cAn idea for us?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and bent forward and kissed him, using her tongue in all the ways he\u2019d taught her until they were both panting and clinging to each other.</p><p>\u201cAs you said,\u201d she whispered, her chest heaving, \u201cwe seem to get along fabulously well on the physical level.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThat, my dear, is putting it mildly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me that we could learn to communicate on other levels as well.\u201d</p><p>He went still and raised his gaze to hers. She swallowed and forced herself to smile. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking that, well, if we feel so strongly about one another then we should . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould what?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>Monica gathered her courage and blurted it all out at once. \u201cThat we should get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d Andrew whispered in the darkened theater.</p><p>Leah\u2019s gaze reluctantly left the screen, where a Walt Disney animation film was playing.</p><p>Her husband pointed to Scotty, who was curled up in his lap. The toddler was sound asleep. Husband and wife shared a meaningful smile. Andrew reached over and stole a handful of popcorn from her box.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, surprised he\u2019d ask. \u201cThis is the very best part. Besides, Scotty will want to know what he missed.\u201d</p><p>The older grandmotherly type in the row in front of them turned around and glared pointedly at Andrew.</p><p>\u201cMy husband apologizes for disrupting the show,\u201d Leah whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo does my wife,\u201d Andrew added.</p><p>The woman huffily turned around and Leah smothered her laughter as best she could. Her husband certainly wasn\u2019t helping matters any. He was making faces at the old biddy, which caused Leah to giggle all the more.</p><p>The woman turned around once again and Leah nearly choked in her effort to keep from laughing outright. Once she\u2019d composed herself, she scooted down in her seat and leaned her head against Andrew\u2019s shoulder. She hadn\u2019t laughed this much in one day since . . . she couldn\u2019t remember when. It didn\u2019t matter, she was laughing now and it felt incredible. When had she allowed her life to become so cheerless? Time had slipped between her fingers with barely a notice.</p><p>Scotty was a delight, and she loved him until her heart felt as if it would burst. He would be about the same age as the baby they\u2019d wanted to adopt. In some unexplainable way, Leah had transferred the love she had stored in her heart for the child taken from her. Pam must have understood that because she and Doug had asked Leah and her husband if they\u2019d be Scotty\u2019s godparents.</p><p>In the last couple of years they\u2019d done their duty and bought Scotty birthday and Christmas presents, but that had been the extent of their commitment. He held a special place in her heart, but Leah realized now that she\u2019d cheated Andrew and herself out of the pleasure this child could bring into their lives.</p><p>Loving Scotty frightened her. She feared she might become overly attached to her friend\u2019s son. The pain of the lost adoption had cheated her out of enjoying Scotty the way she should. She\u2019d feared that if she became overly attached, he\u2019d be taken from her too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The movie ended and the lights came up. Scotty yawned and, sitting up, rubbed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing, big boy?\u201d Andrew asked.</p><p>Scotty blinked several times, as if he\u2019d forgotten where he was and who he was with. A look of panic came into his eyes as he glanced around the theater, and then to Leah.</p><p>\u201cRemember, Mommy and Daddy went to dinner,\u201d Leah reminded him.</p> <p>He nodded, but he didn\u2019t seem overly happy about it.</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re hungry,\u201d Andrew said, lifting him onto his shoulders. Andrew waited until the aisle was clear and then led the way out of the theater. It was dark by the time they reached the parking lot and the stars glittered like a splattering of diamond dust tossed across a bed of shiny black satin.</p><p>\u201cWant to make a wish?\u201d Leah asked.</p><p>Scotty looked to the heavens and nodded. He closed his eyes and drew in a deep breath, releasing it all at once. His eyes flew open and he grinned broadly.</p><p>\u201cI bet he misses Diane and Jason,\u201d Andrew said, unlocking the car door.</p> <p>\u201cNope,\u201d Scotty said. \u201cI like you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get a big head,\u201d Leah warned her husband, under her breath. \u201cHe\u2019d say the same thing to anyone who gave him horsy rides and took him to the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Andrew agreed, \u201cbut it\u2019s me he loves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuntie Leah too.\u201d</p><p>Leah planted a kiss on his chubby cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s telling him, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until much later, hours after they\u2019d finished the dinner dishes, long after they\u2019d read Scotty a story and tucked him into the guest bed, that the emptiness surrounded her.</p> <p>The night was dark and moonless as Leah slipped out of her bedroom and wandered into the room where Scotty slept. Standing over his sleeping figure, she gazed down on this perfect child who belonged to her friend, and held the pain of her loss tight within her soul.</p><p>She finally moved and walked over to the closet. Standing on her tiptoes, she brought down the baby book she\u2019d hidden there.</p><p>Sitting in the silence and the dark, she held the book in her lap and turned each empty page until she\u2019d made her way through the entire satin-covered book. From newborn to the space for the high school graduation photo. When she\u2019d finished, she pressed the book against her heart and rocked back and forth as if she were holding the long-awaited child in her arms.</p><p>Instead she clung to a hollow dream.</p><p>Jody gasped.</p><p>Jeff alive! It wasn\u2019t possible. She could hear her mother-in-law continue speaking but the words were unintelligible and seemed to come from a far-off distance. It was then that Jody realized she\u2019d dropped the phone and had backed away.</p><p>\u201cJody.\u201d Glen was there and she turned and buried her face in his chest. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, his words as gentle as the arms that comforted her.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Timmy asked, picking up the receiver. Gloria continued talking, apparently not realizing anything was amiss. \u201cGrandma says she needs to talk to you,\u201d her son said.</p> <p>Jody shook her head. \u201cNo. No, I can\u2019t, not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell your grandmother your mother will call her back later,\u201d Glen instructed. He encircled her shoulders and led her back to the living room. Gently he lowered her onto the sofa cushions. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Speaking was beyond her. Tears filled her eyes and spilled like burning acid against her cheeks, scalding her skin.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Mom?\u201d Timmy asked, racing to her side. \u201cGrandma said she didn\u2019t mean to upset you. She told me to tell you to call her the minute you\u2019re feeling better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say anything to you?\u201d Jody demanded, gripping her son by the shoulders and making a careful study of his features. It was important that Gloria not say anything to Timmy. If her mother-in-law had made the outlandish claim to her son, Jody didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d find it in her heart to forgive her.</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d Timmy wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI think your mother could do with a cold glass of water,\u201d Glen interrupted. \u201cWould you get it for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Eager to help, Timmy hurried into the kitchen.</p><p>Glen\u2019s hands clasped Jody\u2019s. \u201cWhat did Jeff\u2019s mother say to you?\u201d</p><p>Speaking the words aloud was difficult. \u201cShe . . . claims Jeff\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>Glen released a troubled sigh. \u201cIs there any chance it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>Jody shook her head. \u201cNone. His body was positively identified by dental records. The same thing happened the first Christmas after we buried him. Gloria insisted Jeff wasn\u2019t dead. We argued and our relationship has been strained ever since. She\u2019s never understood that I had to divorce Jeff in order to sell the property, especially when she insisted she would continue to support Timmy and me, but I couldn\u2019t do that. I couldn\u2019t financially drain her or my own parents.\u201d</p><p>Glen sat next to her and gently patted her hand. \u201cShe sounds like a lonely old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It shouldn\u2019t upset me when she does these things, but it does. I thought . . . I hoped she was making progress. I know she\u2019s trying, but it\u2019s hard for her. Jeff was her only child and she loved him very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Mom.\u201d Timmy vaulted into the room with a glass of water. The liquid sloshed over the rim as he presented it to her. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d Timmy asked Glen.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma Potter\u2019s real nice,\u201d Timmy explained, \u201cbut she\u2019s a little weird sometimes. She visits old ladies who talk to the dead people and it doesn\u2019t have to be Halloween.\u201d</p><p>Jody, drinking the water, almost choked at Timmy\u2019s comment about Halloween. Leave it to a kid to put everything into the proper perspective.</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother badly misses your father,\u201d Glen explained, kneeling down so his eyes were level with the nine-year-old. \u201cAnd when you love someone so very much it eases the pain to pretend they\u2019re still with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma\u2019s been missing him a long time,\u201d Timmy said solemnly, then looked to Jody. \u201cMy mom has too. Until you came along all she ever thought about was my dad and her garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d Glen asked.</p><p>\u201cIt bothered me a little because I\u2019d like to have a dad who\u2019s alive and who can teach me the things a kid needs to know. I was kind of hoping you\u2019d like me and my mom enough to stick around a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you both a whole lot,\u201d Glen assured him.</p><p>\u201cEnough to last through baseball season?\u201d</p><p>Glen laughed and hugged the boy. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be around at least that long. Of course it\u2019s up to your mother if she wants to continue dating me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d Timmy said enthusiastically, \u201cdon\u2019t you, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Jody knew she shouldn\u2019t allow her conversation with Jeff\u2019s mother to upset her, but it had. There\u2019d been similar discussions over the years.</p><p>Jody remembered vividly every detail of every long-ago conversation. One had ruined her Christmas, but she refused to allow it to happen a second time. She\u2019d met a good, kind man and she wasn\u2019t going to allow her ex-mother-in-law\u2019s grief to interfere in celebration of the holidays.</p><p>If that was the case, Jody reasoned, why couldn\u2019t she sleep? The house was dark and quiet, and she wandered from room to room, unable to quiet that deep inner part of herself.</p><p>The pain, she realized, was as fresh now as it had been when she\u2019d been forced to accept that Jeff was dead.</p><p>Her father had phoned from Germany with the news. He explained that he\u2019d be bringing Jeff\u2019s body home for burial. She had written down the flight details on a slip of paper and calmly thanked him for dealing with these agonizing details. It wasn\u2019t until after she\u2019d hung up the phone that the full impact of what her father had said settled over her.</p><p>Jeff was dead. The years of not knowing had come to an end.</p><p>The intolerable waiting was over. The haunting questions had been answered, but the sharp edges of her grief were only beginning. The agony of the unknown felt almost comfortable compared to the brutal loss of hope she\u2019d suffered in exchange.</p><p>Until Jeff\u2019s remains could be positively identified\u2014until she could place her husband\u2019s body in the ground and stand at his tombstone, there had always been hope, however slim, that he was alive. Now that had been stripped away from her and she was left to bleed.</p><p>Jody remembered how she ripped the flight information from the pad and folded it over and over again until it was a tight square, clenching it in her fist. She needed something to hold on to. All there was for her was a folded slip of paper that listed the information on the flight that was bringing her husband\u2019s body home.</p><p>For a long time she\u2019d done nothing but sit and stare into the silence. Her heart had felt as if it had stopped beating.</p><p>It was then, Jody realized, that a part of herself had died. No one could endure this kind of emotional torture and possibly survive.</p><p>She was dead to all the happy dreams they\u2019d shared. Dead to whatever the future would hold, because she couldn\u2019t share her tomorrows with the man she\u2019d loved so fiercely.</p><p>Helen Chandler had arrived shortly after the call came from Jody\u2019s father. She walked into the house and softly called Jody\u2019s name. Jody had stared up at her mother, her eyes dry, her heart shattered. At first she didn\u2019t acknowledge her presence. No one could comfort her. Not even her own mother.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Helen had whispered.</p><p>Jody nodded. She couldn\u2019t deny it any longer. The hope had been forever destroyed.</p><p>Her mother had attempted to console her, wrapping her arms around Jody\u2019s shoulders. But Jody held herself stiff and unyielding.</p><p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d her mother pleaded. \u201cLet him rest in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace?\u201d Jody whispered. How could she possibly have peace now? She shook her head, refusing to release any part of her life with Jeff.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been found, Jody. Jeff\u2019s coming home.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps Jeff\u2019s body had been located, Jody reasoned, but she was more lost now than ever. And she doubted that she would ever find her way again.</p><p>How much time had passed since that disastrous day, Jody wondered. Four years? Or was it five? Like so much else in her life, she\u2019d lost track. She moved, one day into the next, dragging her pain with her, the weight almost more than she could bear.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Timmy had written the letter to God that she realized what she was doing to herself and to her boy. It had shocked her into taking action.</p><p>For the first time since Jeff\u2019s death, she was making a new life for herself and for her son, and she couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, let that be ruined. It had taken her this long to find her footing and she wasn\u2019t going to allow anyone to topple her again.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Angels rarely wept. It happened so seldom, and only while they were on earth duty. Mercy had heard tales of angel tears, but never experienced the phenomenon herself. It was an unpleasant experience. Now they came as a surprise, misting her gaze. She brushed them aside, feeling Leah\u2019s pain as deeply as if it were her own as the young nurse clenched the empty baby book against her bosom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mercy had done everything possible, but she hadn\u2019t been able to help. It was the most frustrating case she had ever encountered.</p><p>If only Mercy could sit down and talk to Leah, face to face. If only Mercy could explain to this woman of the earth that she must find serenity within herself before her prayer could be answered. But that was impossible.</p><p>And so they both wept.</p><p>Leah cried silent tears standing guard over her friend\u2019s child while Mercy wept openly, unable to contain her sorrow at this feeling of helplessness.</p> <p>\u201cMarried.\u201d The word went through Chet like a bullet, with much the same effect. He bolted off the bed and stood, the sour taste of panic filling his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt seems the logical thing to do,\u201d Monica said, her voice as sweet as chocolate-dipped caramels.</p><p>Chet rubbed his hand down his face, hoping that would set matters straight in his mind. It didn\u2019t. If anything, his thoughts filled with pure terror. \u201cSweetheart, in case you haven\u2019t figured it out, I\u2019m not the marrying kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Monica continued softly, \u201cI\u2019m not either. It seems we\u2019re perfect for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the marrying kind? Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d She remained on the bed, so beautiful he had to force himself to look away. Otherwise he just might find himself considering her ridiculous suggestion. Much more of this sexual teasing they\u2019d been exchanging and he\u2019d find himself agreeing to just about anything.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-five years old and have never been asked,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cMichael\u2019s chomping at the bit, waiting for the opportunity,\u201d Chet muttered. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d said that, not after the fretful evening he\u2019d spent thinking about Monica cheek to cheek with the other man. He quickly glanced about the room, making sure he wasn\u2019t leaving anything behind, such as his heart and a good portion of common sense. He looped his leg over the windowsill, eager to make his escape before he found himself actually discussing the possibility of marriage. The mere thought sent cold chills down his spine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Monica was kneeling on top of the mattress. Her eyes were wide and pleading. \u201cDon\u2019t go. Please.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cplease\u201d had cost her a good deal, but Chet knew that if he didn\u2019t make his escape then and there, it would be too late. Before he knew what he was doing, he\u2019d find himself agreeing to this asinine scheme of hers.</p><p>As it was, their ongoing relationship continued to confound him. He\u2019d never meant to see her again after she\u2019d lectured him on the misery brought on by the evils of alcohol. Little by little he\u2019d knowingly allowed himself to be drawn to this preacher\u2019s daughter. They\u2019d been a hair\u2019s breadth from making love only moments earlier. She didn\u2019t seem to realize how close they\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cI should have realized,\u201d she said in a small, pitiful voice, \u201cthat you wouldn\u2019t want to marry me.\u201d</p> <p>Chet groaned inwardly. He was prepared to slip into the night as unnoticed as when he\u2019d first arrived, but she\u2019d managed to do it again. This woman knew exactly which cords to pull to reach him. It happened like this each and every time they met. Much more of this and she\u2019d have the threads wrapped so securely around his heart there\u2019d be no escape.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that,\u201d he said, his back to her. Looking at her was dangerous, especially now with her lips swollen from his kisses and her hair all mussed up. He\u2019d never known a woman who looked more beautiful when her hair wasn\u2019t combed.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d she asked. From the nearness of her voice he knew she\u2019d moved off the bed and was standing almost directly behind him.</p><p>Nothing but the truth would satisfy her, Chet realized, yet he hesitated, knowing she\u2019d argue with the devil himself.</p><p>\u201cTell me exactly what it is then,\u201d she demanded, and he noticed she was regaining some of her natural pluck.</p><p>\u201cListen, sweetheart,\u201d he said, knowing she disliked the affectionate term, \u201cI\u2019m not good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>Until he\u2019d met Monica his life had been reduced to wild weekends, blown paychecks, and cheap thrills with a cocktail waitress. He\u2019d been shot, beaten, and chased down by a jealous husband. Not exactly pick-of-the-litter husband material for a minister\u2019s daughter, but there was no telling Monica anything. He\u2019d learned that the hard way.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Her arms came up under his and she looped her hands on his shoulders, then flattened the side of her face against his back. She felt so good and warm pressed to him that for an instant he was nearly swayed.</p> <p>\u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d she insisted. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize how much you\u2019ve taught me? I was a prude until we met and now I know what it means to be in love. You\u2019ve made me proud to be a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLessons rarely come cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Her arms slipped away from him and Chet was eternally grateful. He slipped out of the window, landing with a thud on the hard ground below.</p><p>Turning around to face her was a mistake in what was proving to be a long line of tactical errors. Her eyes were bright with tears and her lower lip was trembling. Something sharp and painful twisted in his gut. He could deal far easier with her anger than he could her tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to marry you, Monica,\u201d he told her harshly. \u201cSo get that idea out of your head right now. It\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment, then nodded. \u201cYou can\u2019t get much clearer than that. Good night, Chet.\u201d Her voice was soft and a little broken.</p><p>She had her hooks in him good and deep. The best thing for him to do was to get out while the getting was good. Working as a private investigator, Chet had developed a sixth sense for these things. The time to leave was about five minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around,\u201d he tossed over his shoulder. He waited for her to close the window, but she didn\u2019t and he was left to wonder exactly how long she stood there watching him.</p><p>Fighting himself he made it all the way to his car, which he\u2019d parked two streets over. He didn\u2019t want anyone to see his vehicle and connect Monica with him.</p><p>He unlocked the door and sat in the front seat and battled with himself until he accepted that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to leave matters unfinished between them.</p><p>He slammed his fist against the steering wheel, climbed out of the car, and retraced the same route he had taken only moments earlier. He came by the side of the darkened church and toward the back side of the house where Monica\u2019s bedroom was situated.</p><p>Her room was dark. He hesitated, then carefully made his way to the window, tapping lightly against the glass pane. He heard her climb out of the bed and pull up the sash.</p><p>Neither of them spoke right away. It was as if they were both unsure of what to say. After coming all the way back, Chet hadn\u2019t any more of a clue than when he left the car. Apparently Monica didn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cI volunteered to be a bell ringer,\u201d she whispered. He couldn\u2019t see her face as clearly as he would have liked, but he could tell from the soft catch in her voice that she\u2019d been crying.</p><p>Damn fool woman. She should have known better than to fall in love with the likes of him.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he found himself asking, already anxious to see her again. They were playing a no-win game, but for the life of him Chet couldn\u2019t make himself walk away from her.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow afternoon between two and three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame street as before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The last part was barely discernible. \u201cChet,\u201d she said more clearly, but he heard the hesitation in her voice. He heard the pain too, but ignored it as best he could, which was near impossible.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he prompted when she didn\u2019t immediately continue.</p><p>She was kneeling, he noticed, her face only a short distance from his own. \u201cDo you . . . are you in love with me?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take him long to respond. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It was the honest-to-God truth. What did someone like him know about love? Damn little to be sure.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be any more articulate than that?\u201d The righteous ring was back in her voice and he found himself smiling.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he said, realizing what an inadequate phrase that was.</p><p>\u201cIn other words I turn you on?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he liked her vernacular, but he wasn\u2019t in any position to be arguing since he was the one who\u2019d taught her everything she knew about the sexual part of her nature. He never figured she\u2019d be such a fast learner.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d was about all he was willing to admit.</p><p>\u201cHow much more?\u201d</p><p>He should have known she wouldn\u2019t leave that alone. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, raising his voice more than he\u2019d intended. His words seemed to echo like thunder in the silence of the night. All they needed now was to wake her old man. \u201cI just don\u2019t know,\u201d he repeated, softer this time. \u201cListen, Monica, it doesn\u2019t help to phrase the same question in different ways, the answer\u2019s going to be the same. I don\u2019t know about love. I\u2019ve never been in love before, so how am I supposed to know if what I feel for you is any different than what I\u2019ve felt in the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely you\u2019ve had some experience with love.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was low and husky. \u201cExperience I\u2019ve got, lots of that, but mainly it\u2019s of the physical nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words if . . . if we\u2019d made love, then you might be able to tell me exactly what your feelings are towards me.\u201d The stiff indignation was back as inflexible as always.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d It did his heart good to hear the outrage in her voice, although he\u2019d never known a woman who could irritate him faster. By the same token he\u2019d never known a woman who did the other things to him she did either. The problem was, he still hadn\u2019t figured out whether he liked it or not. Mostly he liked it, he reasoned, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t keep coming back for more.</p><p>\u201cI have my principles, Chet Costello, and I can tell you right now that I refuse to sleep with any man until after we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>Laughing was a gross error and he knew it, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. He could have had her any number of times. The only thing that had stopped him was knowing that neither one of them would be the same afterward.</p><p>Monica was innocent in the ways of men and he refused to take from her what rightly belonged to another. His thoughts were abruptly ended when Monica slammed the window shut, practically in his face.</p><p>Her eyes glared out at him accusingly.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have laughed and knew it even as the amusement escaped his throat. As means of an apology, he pressed his fingertips to his lips and then set his open hand against the cold windowpane.</p><p>Monica\u2019s angry gaze held his in what little light the moon afforded. After a moment, she pantomimed his action and poised her hand on the other side of the glass against his.</p><p>Reluctantly, he dropped his hand and turned away from her while he had the strength. He didn\u2019t know where the relationship was leading and as far as he could see they were striding down a dead-end street, but for the life of him he couldn\u2019t make himself terminate it. Maybe he did love her; he didn\u2019t ever want to think about the consequences of that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYoung man.\u201d</p><p>The voice startled Chet. He was getting sloppy in his old age, otherwise he\u2019d never have been heard cutting through her side yard. Chet whirled around to find a thin man standing on the front lawn, dressed in a robe and slippers, holding a flashlight. It could only be Monica\u2019s father.</p><p>Chet drew in his breath and waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know exactly what you\u2019re doing on my property this time of night?\u201d Lloyd Fisher demanded, aiming the flashlight into his eyes, blinding him.</p> <p>It was happening, Leah thought. She woke to the buzzing of the alarm and even before she opened her eyes she realized how queasy her stomach was. Was it possible? Could she be pregnant?</p><p>Mentally she tried to calculate the dates of her last menstrual cycle, and couldn\u2019t. Sometime the first part of November, she guessed. It would help if she hadn\u2019t tossed her notebook in the garbage.</p><p>It was wishful thinking, she finally decided. Or the flu. Probably a nasty virus, she mused, yawning.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Andrew said, cuddling her. His hand automatically slipped over her abdomen as he scooted closer to her side. Leah savored his warmth. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Leah smiled. Their routine was the same every morning. It was these small things, these everyday habits that had become a part of the structure of their marriage.</p><p>After Andrew had gone to make the coffee, Leah decided to take her temperature for old times\u2019 sake, not that it would tell her anything.</p><p>Two minutes later she was studying the normal reading and calling herself a silly goose, grateful Andrew hadn\u2019t caught her with the thermometer in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just have yogurt this morning,\u201d Leah said when she entered the kitchen.</p><p>Andrew studied her. \u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him, taking a carton of blueberry-flavored non-fat yogurt out of the refrigerator. The bread popped up from the toaster and Andrew spread a thin layer of butter over the warm surface.</p><p>\u201cYou look a little pale,\u201d he commented, removing the lid from the strawberry jam. He smeared a thick coat over the toast and carried his plate and cup of coffee to the table.</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d Her voice rose with a dash of excitement she couldn\u2019t hide. She brought her yogurt with her and joined him.</p><p>The toast was poised in front of Andrew\u2019s mouth and he slowly lowered it to his plate. He didn\u2019t say anything for several moments. \u201cHow late are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I threw away my notebook, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you can figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI guess not. It doesn\u2019t matter though, does it? If you\u2019re pregnant we\u2019ll both be happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I\u2019m not?\u201d she asked, watching him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not,\u201d he concluded, munching on the toast. He made it sound as if it didn\u2019t matter to him one way or another. Leah knew that wasn\u2019t true, not after having had Scotty with them for two days. Andrew was wonderful with children. He deserved to be a father. The familiar ache returned but the intensity wasn\u2019t as strong as it had been. The pain that had been so much a part of her all these years seemed to peel away and disappear.</p><p>She\u2019d experienced this sensation only once before\u2014the night she\u2019d met Andrew.</p><p>She remembered the first time she saw him. They were both college students attending the University of Washington. Some friends had introduced them and the minute they\u2019d exchanged greetings Leah felt a powerful emotional punch. She wished there was a word to describe the feeling that came over her. It was as if fate had given her a swift kick where she\u2019d feel it.</p><p>From that moment on she knew this man was going to be an important part of her life. Afterward she discounted the feeling, chalking it up to the beer she\u2019d had earlier. Andrew was steadily dating someone else at the time and she\u2019d heard rumors that he was close to becoming engaged.</p><p>They ran into each other soon after that at the library. Leah was struggling with a chemistry class, certain she was going to fail. The library was the only place she could study and so she made the nightly trek across campus to hit the books.</p><p>Andrew had been grappling over a term paper and they\u2019d sat at the same table for nearly two hours without speaking a word. Leah had wanted to get to know him better, but hadn\u2019t exchanged more than a preliminary hello, good-to-see-you-again sort of chitchat.</p><p>Andrew left first, whispered something about being glad to see her again, and was gone. But when she\u2019d walked out of the library he was waiting for her. A couple of friends had delayed him, he explained, and besides he didn\u2019t think it was a good idea for her to walk across the campus alone in the dark. So he escorted her back to her dorm.</p><p>They continued to meet nightly at the library long after his term paper had been turned in and graded. Later Andrew told her she was the only girl he\u2019d ever dated who helped improve his GPA. He\u2019d done more studying with her than any other woman he\u2019d ever dated.</p><p>Leah didn\u2019t know when she realized she was in love with him. The night they\u2019d met seemed a good choice. She just knew.</p><p>Just as she knew now, in the deepest most sheltered part of her heart, that she was going to have a child.</p><p>Leah didn\u2019t question where this knowledge came from. It wasn\u2019t intuition, or instinct, or anything psychic, but a deep abiding belief that her time of waiting had come to an end.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to buy one of those home pregnancy test kits,\u201d Andrew said, frowning, as he carried his empty plate to the sink. He rinsed it off and stuck it in the dishwasher.</p><p>They\u2019d been through this procedure no less than a dozen times over the years. The minute she was a day late, Leah typically ran to the drugstore, needing to know the answer as soon as possible. For all the test kits she\u2019d purchased over the years, she should be entitled to a discount.</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you said, if I\u2019m pregnant, great, and if not, well, then I\u2019m not.\u201d She looped her arms around his neck and kissed him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her right away. Instead he carefully studied her upturned face. \u201cSomething\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d she asked, beaming him a smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what, but it\u2019s there in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Leah knew what it was. She was pregnant. Oh, heaven help her, she was diving into the deep end again and she hadn\u2019t meant for that to happen.</p><p>She knew she was pregnant. Felt it to the very marrow of her bones, but she\u2019d believed the same thing a hundred times before.</p><p>Now was different. The feeling she had now was as powerful as the night she met Andrew, but she couldn\u2019t allow her sanity to rest on something as immeasurable as a feeling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d he asked, looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cI feel wonderful,\u201d she said, tightly hugging her husband\u2019s waist. She closed her eyes, praying with all her heart that this wasn\u2019t a sick joke her mind was playing on her.</p><p>From the moment she\u2019d received the call claiming Jeff was alive, Jody had dreaded contacting her mother-in-law. She carefully bided her time and waited until Timmy was down for the night. Even then it had taken Jody another half hour to fortify her courage enough to reach for the phone. She didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d find the grit to face Jeff\u2019s mother when she was in one of these moods.</p><p>\u201cHello, Gloria,\u201d Jody said calmly, knowing she\u2019d probably woken her mother-in-law from a sound sleep.</p><p>\u201cJody,\u201d she said groggily, \u201cis that you?\u201d Not giving her time to answer, she immediately continued. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you called me back. I know this news is as much of a shock to you as it is me, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloria,\u201d Jody cut in calmly, unwilling to listen to any more. Her only chance of reaching Jeff\u2019s mother was when she sounded composed and confident. \u201cJeff is dead.\u201d</p><p>Someone had played the cruelest of hoaxes on them. \u201cWho phoned you?\u201d Jody demanded, and a telltale wobble came into her voice, betraying her slipping poise.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get his name,\u201d Gloria explained. \u201cYou see, I was so excited that I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly, but he sounded very professional. He gave me details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of details?\u201d It was clear this line of questioning was flustering Jeff\u2019s mother all the more, but for the sake of them all Jody had to get to the bottom of this.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really tell you right this minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say where he was calling from?\u201d Jody asked more calmly this time.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, he was in Germany. Such a nice young man. You see, the call woke me in the middle of the night. I didn\u2019t believe him at first and then the more he talked the more I realized he was telling the truth. Jeff is alive. In my heart I always knew he was and now it\u2019s coming to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t the authorities have contacted me?\u201d Jody asked.</p><p>\u201cI . . . don\u2019t know, dear. Maybe it has something to do with the divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely they\u2019d want me to know. After all, Timmy is Jeff\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer your questions, Jody. All I know is what they said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have written everything down, but I was too excited, and I\u2019m on this new heart medication that makes my mind go all fuzzy at times.\u201d</p><p>Jody\u2019s grip on the phone relaxed. \u201cWas this one of those times, Mom?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, this was all very real. I thought to call you right away, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d Jody concluded when the older woman hesitated.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Gloria said, following a heartfelt sigh, \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t believe me, and I was afraid we would end up arguing and I do so hate the thought of us disagreeing. You and Timmy are the only family I have left.\u201d</p><p>Left. The details were quickly tallying in Jody\u2019s mind. Her mother-in-law was taking a new heart medication, one that, at times, confused her and she\u2019d been woken abruptly from a sound sleep. The episode was probably a very lifelike dream. Not entirely sure the phone call had happened herself, Gloria had delayed contacting Jody until the following evening.</p><p>Because she\u2019d been so desperate to believe her son was alive, Jeff\u2019s mother had clung to the dream, building it in her mind, until she\u2019d convinced herself it was authentic.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from anyone since?\u201d Jody asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNo. You think I should have, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I think. What do you believe?\u201d</p><p>Speaking on the phone had always been an inadequate means of communication as far as Jody was concerned. She heard the faint intake of breath that came from her mother-in-law and knew Gloria was weeping softly. How Jody wished she could be there to wrap her arms around her and comfort her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jody had needed consolation herself the night before when Gloria had first phoned and there\u2019d been a strong pair of arms to hold her. It had helped tremendously.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Timmy?\u201d her mother-in-law asked in an apparent effort to change the subject. \u201cI bet he\u2019s getting excited for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimmy\u2019s great.\u201d Jody couldn\u2019t talk about her rambunctious son and not smile. \u201cWe chopped down a Christmas tree this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll by yourselves?\u201d</p> <p>Jody hesitated, unsure if she should mention Glen or not. This didn\u2019t seem to be the appropriate time to drop the news that she was dating again, although heaven knew it was well past the time she should.</p><p>\u201cA friend went along and helped,\u201d she answered, being as diplomatic as she could.</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d Gloria repeated slowly, thoughtfully. \u201cMale or female?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMale.\u201d She couldn\u2019t leave it at that. She\u2019d need to explain now. \u201cGlen\u2019s an attorney who works at the same law firm I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Funny how much was visible in those two brief words. \u201cJust how long have you been dating this . . . other man?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom, it isn\u2019t like that. We\u2019ve only been out a couple of times, but it isn\u2019t anything . . .\u201d She stopped herself in time from saying \u201cserious.\u201d Glen was serious. He\u2019d said as much from the first. He wanted a wife and family. Timmy wanted and needed a father figure. She needed a husband. One who would laugh with her, one who would hold her when she needed to be held. One who would fill the empty spaces of her heart.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s becoming clear to me now,\u201d Gloria said stiffly. \u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t want to hear about Jeff. You\u2019re involved with another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, that\u2019s not true.\u201d This was an impossible conversation, and growing more so every minute. The immediate sense of guilt she experienced was nearly crippling.</p><p>\u201cThe man who called from Germany knew that you\u2019d divorced my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, we\u2019ve been through this a thousand times or more. I didn\u2019t divorce Jeff because I didn\u2019t love him any longer. It was for financial reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never satisfied with that excuse and you know it. Both your parents and I were more than willing to support you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who called asked me about you and Timmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t, please,\u201d Jody whispered, her small voice trembling. \u201cIt was a dream. It never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did call.\u201d Gloria\u2019s high voice rattled from the telephone receiver. \u201cJeff\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize it\u2019s difficult for you to accept that I\u2019m dating again, but it\u2019s time I got on with my life. Don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve grieved long enough? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time?\u201d Despite her resolve not to break down, she was crying. It happened like this nearly every time they spoke.</p><p>\u201cI imagine you plan to marry this other man?\u201d Gloria continued, her voice filled with disdain.</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can remarry, you know, there\u2019s nothing I can do to stop you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Jody said, bewildered and miserable, looking for a means of ending the conversation.</p><p>\u201cThat would make for a fine thing for my son to come home to, his wife married to another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please don\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d Gloria said accusingly, knowing she had the upper hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t want Jeff to be alive. You\u2019ve made such a fine life for yourself that it would be inconvenient for you if he did turn up alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true,\u201d Jody sobbed.</p><p>\u201cDo I, now? You have your new boyfriend, you don\u2019t need Jeff anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlen is a friend,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what you said earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time we ended this,\u201d Jody said, struggling for what little composure remained.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just fine with me. But I think you should know, I\u2019m going to tell Jeff myself just what kind of wife you turned out to be. He\u2019s going to call me soon, and then I\u2019ll tell him. Then he\u2019ll know the truth about you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Leah walked into her house and was greeted with the fresh, pungent scent of evergreen. The decorator had arrived and set up the Christmas tree, and it was breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>The flocked tree looked as if it belonged in the foyer of a classy hotel. Glossy gold bows were strung in one continuous ribbon from top to bottom. Bright red porcelain poinsettia flowers were symmetrically placed. And then there were the angels. Leah counted twelve. In gold gowns with massive white wings, each one playing a musical instrument. A guitar, a harp, a saxophone, a tuba, and flute. A horn and trombone. It became a game to find each one hidden among the heavy white limbs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d Andrew said, ambling into the living room from the kitchen. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, his gaze following hers toward the Christmas tree, \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so too.\u201d</p><p>She hung her coat in the closet.</p><p>\u201cDebbi outdid herself this year,\u201d Andrew said, bending over and turning on the tree lights. Ten strings of miniature red globes glowed, casting warm shadows about the room.</p><p>The decorator was a friend of Andrew\u2019s mother. As part of her Christmas gift to Andrew and Leah, Shirley Lundberg had their Christmas tree decorated.</p><p>\u201cI love the angels,\u201d Leah said, slipping her arm around her husband\u2019s waist and pressing her head to his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d your day go?\u201d</p><p>There was far more to the question than what he was asking. What Andrew wanted to know was if she was feeling the same queasy sensation she had the last few days both in the mornings and late in the afternoons. He was asking if her period had started. In sum he wanted to know if she was pregnant.</p><p>\u201cMy day was great, how about yours?\u201d she asked, smiling up at him.</p><p>His gaze skirted past hers. \u201cLet\u2019s sit down,\u201d he suggested. With a flip of the switch, the gas fireplace roared to life and tongues of fire licked at the imitation logs.</p><p>Together they sank into the soft comfort of the leather sofa. Andrew\u2019s arm was tucked around her shoulders and he rested his chin on the crown of her head. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cThis sounds ominous.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, but she noticed his laughter contained a dash of concern. \u201cI\u2019d feel a whole lot more comfortable if we got one of those pregnancy test kits,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d she asked, laughing off his request. \u201cWe\u2019ll know sooner or later, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been on this emotional high all week and I\u2019m afraid if it continues much longer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am pregnant,\u201d she said with supreme confidence. \u201cI know it\u2019s finally happening for us. There\u2019s never been any physical reason why we can\u2019t have children. Dr. Benoit assured us of that countless times. How many times has he claimed all we need do is relax and that it\u2019ll happen when we least expect it? I don\u2019t know about you, Andrew, but I\u2019m floored by this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah, please, listen to reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur time of waiting has passed,\u201d she insisted, unwilling to listen to his arguments.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so certain, then it won\u2019t matter if you take the test now or later, will it?\u201d Andrew pressed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to buy another one of those awful test kits. I hate them.\u201d She eased herself away from him and stiffly folded her arms. They\u2019d been through this routine countless times and the result had always been devastatingly the same.</p><p>Negative.</p><p>No matter how long she studied the results she couldn\u2019t make them read what she yearned for so desperately. No, she wouldn\u2019t subject herself to that again.</p><p>\u201cLeah, please. I just don\u2019t want you to get yourself worked up over this. You\u2019re a few days late and already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m late. You don\u2019t either. To my way of thinking, you\u2019re making more of this than necessary. As you said before, if I\u2019m pregnant, great, if not, well, then I\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He was uncharacteristically silent, but Leah knew her husband well enough to recognize how deceptive this calm could be.</p><p>\u201cLet me do this my way,\u201d she asked, reaching for his hand and kissing his knuckles.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond immediately. \u201cI can\u2019t stand by and watch you do this to yourself. How many times have you gone through this?\u201d he demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same and each time your hopes go a little higher and you fall a little harder. Each time it takes you longer to recover.\u201d</p><p>Leah knew what he was saying was true, but this was different. This time she\u2019d throw back her head and shout for joy. This time her heart and her soul would be left intact. How she wished there was some way to reassure Andrew.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am worried.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him. \u201cDon\u2019t, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you won\u2019t take the home pregnancy test?\u201d The fire crackled in the distance adding punctuation to his request.</p><p>She hated to refuse him anything, but it was necessary. Those tests dredged up far too many unpleasant memories. That was all in the past, and her future, their future, was spilling over with promise.</p><p>\u201cNo, Andrew, I won\u2019t. Not this time.\u201d She threw her arms into the air and fell backward so that she was sprawled across his lap, smiling up into his face. \u201cNow kiss me, you fool.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes as though to blot her out. \u201cLeah, for the love of\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t allow him to finish, but gripped hold of his neck and levered herself upward until her mouth met his. As familiar as she was with her husband\u2019s body, Leah knew exactly what she needed to do to evoke a strong and positive response.</p><p>\u201cLeah.\u201d Her name became a helpless plea.</p><p>\u201cI have this incredible urge to ravish you,\u201d she whispered, opening the buttons of his neatly pressed dress shirt. He groaned when her hands met his warm skin.</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d he managed, between slow, deep kisses.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d she asked, rotating her hands around to his back. His heart was pounding hard and fast, but then so was her own.</p><p>\u201cCan wait,\u201d he told her brokenly.</p><p>Leah smiled softly to herself. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she was dressing for work the following morning that Leah found the pregnancy test kit. How long it had been sitting on the bathroom counter she could only speculate. Probably from the night before.</p><p>The night before. A small, satisfied smile lit up her eyes. They might be an old married couple, but the lovemaking couldn\u2019t get more incredible or more romantic than beneath a glowing Christmas tree in front of a flickering fire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She carried the test kit into the kitchen with her and set it down on the kitchen table in front of her husband. \u201cIs this a hint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs broad as I can make it,\u201d he said, and finished his glass of orange juice. \u201cFor the love of heaven, let\u2019s get this agony over with.\u201d</p><p>It was then that Leah knew.</p><p>In the beginning she was afraid he was worried about her building her hopes upon a foundation of sand. But it was more than that. Andrew was suffering the torment of the unknown himself.</p> <p>For years, Andrew had disguised his feelings, not allowing her to guess how very much he wanted children.</p><p>He was studying her now, his features sharp and anxious. \u201cHow much longer will you wait?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to make some flippant reply, some casual remark that they could both laugh away, but it wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019ll ease your mind,\u201d she said, disliking even this small compromise, \u201cI\u2019ll make an appointment with Dr. Benoit right away.\u201d The physician, however dear, produced a flood of unhappy memories. She couldn\u2019t think of him and not remember the months of hormone shots, the ultrasound, and everything else they\u2019d attempted over the last seven years.</p><p>\u201cAll right, call your doctor friend,\u201d Andrew said, but he didn\u2019t sound especially pleased. He wanted to know. The sooner the better.</p> <p>Not so with Leah. She\u2019d already received all the confirmation she needed.</p><p>Monica had been standing in the cold, sounding the bell for charitable donations, for nearly forty-five minutes. She was cold, her feet hurt, and she was almost convinced Chet wouldn\u2019t show.</p><p>Not after her father had caught him walking out of their yard in the dead of night. Worse, she\u2019d been left to speculate what had happened. Her father had remained uncharacteristically tight-lipped about the incident. She\u2019d tried once to pry information from him, but to no avail. Any further questions and he\u2019d guess that her interest was more than normal curiosity.</p><p>Monica felt Chet\u2019s presence several seconds before he came into view. Her body was developing a kind of sonar when it came to locating him. Her spirits lifted immediately and she drew in a deep breath and whispered a soft prayer of thankfulness.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she whispered, when he strolled up to the bright red pot and slipped a twenty-dollar bill inside.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he murmured, not looking at her.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me afterwards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She was in love and a woman in love would do whatever was necessary to be with her man. \u201cYour apartment?\u201d she asked, loving to tease him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word was sharp and instant.</p><p>Monica couldn\u2019t help it, she laughed. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPier Fifty-six. I\u2019ll be waiting for you at the restaurant. There\u2019s a table way in the back, closest to the water.\u201d</p><p>She nodded eagerly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you there,\u201d he murmured, and before she could say another word, he was gone. The man was like a magician. He could appear and disappear at the drop of a hat, or so it seemed.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, Monica was hurrying downhill, toward the Seattle waterfront. She raced across the street, promising herself she\u2019d stop on her way to the bus stop and look at the Christmas display in Nordstrom\u2019s window. She\u2019d heard it was angels this year, perched atop a train set that circled a frothy cloud. Stars shone bright from above. Another window was the traditional Santa\u2019s elves at the North Pole and Mrs. Claus baking sugar cookies.</p><p>Chet was sitting at the table, waiting for her. Puget Sound showed through the huge plate-glass window behind him. The sky was blue and clear and the ferry had just pulled away from the dock. The scene was lovely and for a moment she studied the tranquil waters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d she said. She slipped out of her coat and waited a moment, wondering how long it would take Chet to notice her new dress, but he seemed preoccupied and said nothing. Monica was a bit hurt, but let it pass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying for a cup of coffee,\u201d she said.</p><p>Chet waved for the waitress, who carried the glass pot over to the table. \u201cDo you want something to eat?\u201d he asked Monica.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJust coffee for me, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d The waitress refilled his cup and poured hers.</p><p>Chet smiled over at her and the same intense look was back, the one she\u2019d noticed earlier. His frown deepened as if he\u2019d become aware of a change.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s different,\u201d he said, studying her.</p><p>Monica beamed proudly. He had noticed. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a little makeup,\u201d she whispered, leaning toward him. \u201cOut of the blue I got a call from Donna Watkins, a lady from church. She invited me to lunch. Donna\u2019s wonderful with clothes and scarves and pretty pins. . . . I didn\u2019t always think so, but that doesn\u2019t matter now. She claimed she was getting dressed that morning and had the irrepressible urge to call me and invite me out.</p><p>\u201cAfter lunch she took me shopping. I bought the dress and\u201d\u2014she tossed back her head to expose her earlobes\u2014\u201cthese. They\u2019re lovely, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Chet\u2019s eyebrows shot toward his hair line at the sight of the small gold earrings. \u201cI thought you claimed jewelry was a tool of the devil.\u201d</p><p>She might have thought that at one time, but would never have said so, at least not publicly. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I said that if a woman opted to wear jewels, then whatever she chose should enhance a meek and gentle spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarrings do all that?\u201d</p><p>He was teasing her, but she didn\u2019t mind. \u201cI think so. Donna did too, but then she had on these huge Christmas tree decorations. They\u2019re wild. As far as I can see, each woman is left to her own interpretation of this.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of coffee, grateful for the warmth it offered her. \u201cDo you like the dress?\u201d She tried to make light of it, but her heart was dangling precariously on her sleeve. Everything she\u2019d bought that afternoon had been with Chet in mind. Each time she stepped before the mirror, her first thought had been what he would think when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very pretty.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t much as compliments went, but enough. \u201cIt\u2019s the first thing I\u2019ve had in years that isn\u2019t black, gray, or navy blue. Donna says I\u2019m a summer, if you know what that means. I didn\u2019t until she explained, but basically I should be wearing pastels, pinks, pale blues, and the like.\u201d</p><p>Chet nodded, but looked distracted, as if this summer business were beyond him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, setting her cup down hard in the saucer, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get sidetracked. Tell me what happened with my dad.\u201d She was breathless with anticipation. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say a word to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened.\u201d</p><p>Chet certainly seemed to be uncommunicative this afternoon. \u201cNothing?\u201d she demanded. There was more to this than met the eye.</p><p>\u201cI explained I was a private investigator and had cut through his yard. I apologized for the intrusion. As far as I could tell he believed me. After he\u2019d read over my license he went back into the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was it?\u201d Surely there was something more. It wasn\u2019t her imagination, her father had been unnecessarily quiet all morning. He seemed preoccupied and absentminded. When she mentioned meeting Donna for an early lunch, he\u2019d encouraged her, and even sounded pleased. He insisted she needn\u2019t come back to the office when she\u2019d finished. Since she was volunteering downtown, she should go directly there.</p><p>\u201cYou seem so quiet,\u201d Monica said after several moments of silence. She\u2019d never seen the serious side of Chet. She\u2019d seen him angry and frustrated, aroused and flippant, but never serious.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to hear her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever realized how truly beautiful you are.\u201d</p><p>Unaccustomed to compliments, Monica felt herself blush. Her heart was so full, it felt as if it were ready to burst. Love must do this to a woman, she decided, but she wouldn\u2019t change this incredible feeling for the world.</p><p>He leaned forward and reached for her hand, gripping her fingers hard with his own. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing some thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout us?\u201d Her chest tightened as though she already knew what he was going to say. In that same moment she recognized that no amount of arguing would change his mind.</p><p>Chet nodded. \u201cIt has to end, Monica. I never intended matters to go this far. You\u2019re bright and beautiful and someday you\u2019ll meet a\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped him from saying anything more by pressing the tips of her fingers against his lips. She knew her eyes were wide and pleading. They stung with the effort to hold back a wall of tears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d she pleaded softly.</p><p>His hand gripped her wrist and he closed his eyes as if this were causing him as much pain as he was inflicting upon her. He kissed her fingers and slowly moved her hand away.</p><p>She lowered her gaze. \u201cThere\u2019s this song,\u201d she whispered in fractured tones, having trouble speaking. \u201cMichael plays it on the piano. It\u2019s from some musical. I don\u2019t know which one . . . it\u2019s about two people who must end their affair, and the girl who\u2019s singing asks only one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll she wants is to choose the time and place where he tells her good-bye. She wants it to be on a Sunday at the zoo. I don\u2019t know why she chose there, but she did.\u201d She forced herself to smile and realized a toddler would have seen through the effort. \u201cI always thought that was the most ridiculous song. The only reason Michael played it was that he knew it irritated me, and now . . . now I think I understand.\u201d</p><p>Chet didn\u2019t say anything for several minutes. Monica couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThe time is now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAt least let me choose the place. Not here in some fancy restaurant with half the world looking on. Let\u2019s go outside to the end of the pier. Tell me there you don\u2019t love me. Tell me there you never want to see me again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to agree or disagree, but stood, taking her coat. With her head held high, she walked out of the restaurant and down the long pier, stopping when she\u2019d reached the farthest corner.</p><p>The wind blew hard against her as she stood at the railing looking out over the green, murky waters. It amazed her that she could be so outwardly calm and still hurt this badly.</p><p>For a moment she feared Chet would choose to leave her there alone, but she was wrong. Soon he joined her. Standing beside her, he braced his elbows against the railing, and looked out over the water. Dusk was setting, and a soft shade of pink brightened the horizon. The wind whistled softly in the background.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I don\u2019t love you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d The words were almost accusing, tight with pain.</p><p>Monica\u2019s hands were buried deep in her coat pockets. She turned to study him. The wind slapped the loose tendrils of her hair about her face. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn it, Monica, I don\u2019t want to argue. We both know all the reasons. We\u2019ve been through all this. I\u2019m not going to get involved in another debate with you. One of us has got to keep his head on straight. Do you think I\u2019m enjoying this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccept it, then. It\u2019s over before either of us has more cause for regret.\u201d</p><p>So this was what it felt like to die, Monica mused. She closed her eyes as the pain worked through her heart, then slowly nodded.</p> <p>\u201cMichael\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love Michael,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cI ran a background check on him for you and he\u2019s squeaky clean. You couldn\u2019t ask for better husband material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, please,\u201d she whispered fervently. She knew what he was doing, but it wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not attracted to Michael, fine. He\u2019s not the only fish in the sea. For that matter I\u2019m not either. You\u2019ll fall in love again. Within a couple of weeks, maybe less.\u201d</p> <p>Monica\u2019s short laugh was filled with more tears than amusement. \u201cOh, Chet, don\u2019t you know me at all? Do you honestly believe I\u2019m the kind of woman to walk from one relationship to another? Do you really think I\u2019d ever marry a man I don\u2019t love?\u201d</p><p>His lack of response was answer enough. \u201cJust don\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I don\u2019t know, join a convent or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for Catholics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that, but knowing you, you\u2019d convert just to spite me. There\u2019s too much passion in you for that, understand? You\u2019ve kept it buried for too damn long as it is. You\u2019ll do fine,\u201d he said starkly, turned, and started to walk away.</p> <p>\u201cChet.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, and his back and his shoulders stiffened, but he didn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>\u201cWould you hold me, please. One last time.\u201d</p><p>It looked as if he intended to keep on walking. He took one step, and then another. Monica bit down so hard on her lip to keep from calling for him that she tasted blood. Whatever it was that caused him to change his mind, she would never know.</p><p>Before another moment passed she was in his arms. His hold on her was hard and tight. Sobbing, she clung to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool,\u201d she told him, weeping so hard, she doubted he could understand her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been one. Why change now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, that and two bits will buy you a cup of coffee.\u201d He broke away from her so abruptly that she nearly stumbled backward. Gripping her hands with his, he raised her fingers to his mouth. \u201cDear God, I can\u2019t believe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can\u2019t you believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He closed his eyes and folded his fingers over hers. \u201cThere\u2019s so much I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Chet,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cdon\u2019t you understand? I\u2019m so grateful for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my gift to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she sobbed, \u201cbreaking my heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, letting you go before I screw up your life as much as I have my own.\u201d He dropped her hands, and without another word, turned and walked away.</p><p>It was highly uncommon to get a summons from Gabriel while on prayer assignment, and Goodness was convinced she was about to be pulled off the case. She had her arguments all lined up. Good ones too. Matters were going much better than they appeared at first glance. She intended to explain everything, if only he\u2019d give her the opportunity.</p><p>At last Goodness had something positive to report. Monica had come to her senses. It was no small task dealing with this human either. The preacher\u2019s daughter had been a challenge from the first, but Goodness had made progress. With some effort, she\u2019d arranged the phone call from Donna Watkins, although she was disappointed that Monica had chosen to impress Chet instead of Michael with her new outfit.</p><p>\u201cGoodness.\u201d Gabriel greeted her upon her arrival. He was pacing, his massive hands clenched behind his back. \u201cI\u2019d like a progress report on Monica Fischer\u2019s prayer request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d ask,\u201d Goodness said, eager to tell her side of the strange happenings. \u201cThere\u2019s a fine young man in her church by the name of Michael Simpson\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cut her off with a look. \u201cI understand she\u2019s currently involved with Chet Costello. And from what I hear, you\u2019re responsible for the two of them meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas involved,\u201d Goodness said quickly, steering the archangel away from the unfortunate incident of Monica literally falling into Chet\u2019s arms. \u201cThat\u2019s all behind her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about Monica and that shoddy detective any longer,\u201d Goodness concluded, folding her hands and proudly flaunting her wings. \u201cMichael Simpson has a good deal going for him. He\u2019s talented and dedicated. I\u2019m sure that within a matter of days, Monica will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDays?\u201d Gabriel repeated.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it will take a week, but I\u2019m confident Monica will come to her senses soon.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel continued his pacing. \u201cFrom what I can see of matters, Monica Fischer is deeply in love, and it isn\u2019t with Michael Simpson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure this private detective was nothing more than a passing fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so, do you?\u201d Gabriel asked calmly. \u201cLook at this and then tell me what you think.\u201d With a wave of his arm, the walls of heaven slowly parted, followed by a rush of warm, humid winds. Mists swirled and Goodness squinted, having trouble locating Monica through the thick fog.</p><p>Soon the vista cleared. It took her a moment to recognize the stark interior of the old church. It was the very sanctuary where Goodness had met her friends\u2014where Reverend Fischer tended his flock of faithful believers.</p><p>Monica was kneeling at the altar, her face buried in her arms as she openly sobbed. It was her tears and her prayers that had created the humid fog. The sounds of her pain rose pitifully toward heaven as if echoing from a sound chamber.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s changed,\u201d Gabriel said gently. \u201cHer hair is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChet, he\u2019s the private detective\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know him well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. \u201cIs he responsible for the other things as well? I notice she\u2019s wearing an attractive dress and gold earrings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I believe so.\u201d Now didn\u2019t seem the time to mention Monica\u2019s lunch with Donna Watkins.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s nod was thoughtful. \u201cI suspected as much. As I recall, the last time I saw Monica, she was trapped in the web of her own righteousness. Am I wrong, or is she a little more willing to accept the differences in us all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t really say, but I must explain, I did a bit of research on this private detective and I don\u2019t mind telling you, he\u2019s had a sordid past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gabriel commented with a decided lack of appreciation. This wasn\u2019t a good sign. \u201cHow far back did you investigate him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last couple of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you learn about his gunshot wound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I wasn\u2019t aware he\u2019d been wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe nearly died. As I understand it, he stepped in front of a bullet to save his friend. He was willing to sacrifice his own life for that of someone he loved. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t enough, his friend died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d The picture Gabriel painted of Chet was becoming clearer. Goodness\u2019s gaze slowly returned to Monica, kneeling at the altar railing, pouring her heart out in prayer. It rose like a sweet-smelling mist toward heaven. \u201cWhat\u2019s she saying?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood behind Goodness. \u201cShe\u2019s thanking God for teaching her about love, for giving her the short time she had with Chet. Her heart is filled with gratitude.\u201d</p><p>Goodness frowned. \u201cGratitude comes with tears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery often it does,\u201d Gabriel admitted with a beleaguered sigh. \u201cIt seems to me you\u2019ve taught Monica Fischer what she needed to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did nothing.\u201d Goodness was more confused than ever. Her efforts had all been geared toward Michael. \u201cThe changes are due to Chet Costello, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Maybe we should look at him.\u201d</p><p>Goodness pressed her lips tightly together. \u201cHe\u2019s probably in a bar somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d The picture of Monica faded and was replaced by one of Chet slouched atop a bar stool, nursing a shot glass. His shoulders were hunched forward and he ignored any attempts at conversation the bartender made.</p><p>\u201cYou notice he isn\u2019t in any church,\u201d Goodness felt obliged to point out.</p><p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d</p><p>A cocktail waitress ambled to his side and whispered something. \u201cThat\u2019s Trixie.\u201d Goodness felt it was important that Gabriel know how well informed she was. She hadn\u2019t slouched in her duties.</p><p>\u201cI know all about Trixie as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must be aware of their ongoing relationship,\u201d Goodness supplied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over and has been from the moment Chet met Monica,\u201d Gabriel said absently. \u201cHe\u2019s doing it again, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinking?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel slowly shook his head. \u201cNo, he\u2019s sacrificing himself for another. He loves Monica, but he doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s right for her. It seems to me that a man who\u2019s twice put the good of someone else before his own deserves something more than pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe deserves love,\u201d Goodness whispered, watching Trixie.</p><p>Goodness thought she heard Gabriel groan. \u201cNot Trixie,\u201d he said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWho, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica Fischer.\u201d</p><p>Goodness felt knocked off-balance. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly mean that the good Lord intends to answer Monica\u2019s prayer for a husband with Chet Costello?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughed, the rich and full sound echoing like a Chinese gong. \u201cMy dear Goodness, that\u2019s what He intended all along.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Jody swore she didn\u2019t sleep except in ten- or fifteen-minute snatches the entire night. It had been like this when Jeff had first disappeared. Mentally and physically exhausted, she\u2019d fall into bed, immediately slip into a druglike sleep only to jerk awake minutes later. The pattern was back.</p><p>Jeff was alive.</p><p>Jeff was dead and buried. Buried and mourned.</p><p>Resurrected.</p><p>The next morning, when the alarm rang, Jody was tempted to call into work sick. The only thing that kept her from doing so was the idea of facing the day at home alone with her doubts\u2014a day alone with her fears. Alone. It held no appeal.</p><p>Sensing her mood, Timmy was extra quiet. He dressed for school while she cooked his breakfast and drove him to the bus stop.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day,\u201d she told him as he climbed out of the car.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Mom.\u201d With that he was gone, hurrying to meet his friends. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The traffic into the city was heavy, but Jody barely noticed. She drove by rote, her mind wandering from one inane topic to another. When she pulled into her assigned spot in the parking garage, she was surprised to realize where she was and had no memory of the commute.</p><p>At least while she was at the office she could occupy her thoughts with matters other than Jeff\u2019s mother. Despite everything, a small part of her\u2014no, she corrected, a very large part of her\u2014had been wounded by the things Gloria had said.</p><p>Why should it matter that her mother-in-law would tell her dead son what a terrible wife Jody was?</p><p>Somehow it did.</p> <p>It unsettled her that Gloria\u2019s opinion of her was so important. Jody had been a good wife. No woman could have possibly loved Jeff more. No woman could have grieved harder, or longer\u2014except, possibly, his mother.</p><p>Because of Timmy it was impossible for Jody to isolate her life the way Gloria had. Because of Timmy she was forced to deal with the present. She\u2019d done a good job, or at least she assumed she had until her son had written his letter to God. Timmy needed her, not to look back and weep with her pain, but to stand tall and proud and to point the direction of their future.</p><p>Jody had no more than settled down at her desk, her thoughts more confused than ever, when Glen Richardson arrived. She looked up at the attorney\u2019s warm, concerned face, and felt an immediate sense of serenity.</p><p>He had a calming affect on her and had from the first. It hadn\u2019t taken long for him to become a good friend, and she\u2019d never needed one more.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go with your mother-in-law?\u201d he asked, sitting on the edge of her desk.</p> <p>Jody averted her gaze. \u201cNot good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lonely old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jody said, \u201cbut somehow that doesn\u2019t make this any easier.\u201d</p><p>Glen\u2019s eyes were sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t. How\u2019s Timmy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. He\u2019s checking the water in the tree stand every morning just the way you said. I swear, he\u2019s brought every kid in the neighborhood home to show them the Christmas tree he cut down by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t I get any credit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently not. He\u2019s got the neighborhood believing he\u2019s a regular lumberjack. He wanted to wear his plaid shirt and boots to school this morning. It seems he\u2019s got an image to live up to now.\u201d</p><p>Glen chuckled, but then his eyes grew serious. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I bought Timmy a baseball mitt for Christmas. I realize it was presumptuous of me to do something like that without talking to you first.\u201d</p><p>Jody wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about Glen giving them presents. It was thoughtful, yes, but baseball mitts were expensive and it seemed to imply that there was something more than mere friendship.</p><p>\u201cThe mitt he showed me is too small for his hand,\u201d Glen explained. \u201cI\u2019m surprised his coach let him play with it. If Timmy\u2019s going to pitch, and he certainly seems to have his heart set on that, then he\u2019ll need a properly fitting mitt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very kind of you, Glen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d He scooted off her desk, and seemed to be waiting for her to chastise him.</p><p>\u201cTimmy will think he\u2019s in heaven.\u201d Jody couldn\u2019t make herself berate Glen. She wouldn\u2019t have known Timmy\u2019s mitt was too small if Glen hadn\u2019t told her. If anything, he\u2019d proved Timmy\u2019s point. Her son needed a father\u2019s loving guidance.</p><p>Glen looked at his watch. \u201cI better get back to my office. I have to be in court later this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for stopping by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. How about dinner one night this week?\u201d</p><p>Before Jody even thought about what she was doing, she nodded.</p><p>This was a pivotal moment for her.</p><p>She\u2019d welcomed another man into her life, calmly accepted his companionship. She had taken for granted that she would see Glen again and soon. More earth-shattering was how much she was looking forward to spending more time with him.</p><p>Some of what she was feeling must have leaked into her eyes, because Glen didn\u2019t leave. Slowly, he walked around to her side of the desk, claimed a second chair, and sat down next to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d he asked, leaning forward and bracing his elbows on his knees. \u201cSomething clicked in your mind just now. I could see it as plain as day. Tell me what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realized how pleased I was that we\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and Jody was certain he didn\u2019t understand the significance of what she was saying. For the last seven years she\u2019d lived her life in limbo. The still, shadow-filled existence had become a shelter to her. It had protected her from exposing her heart to any additional pain. What she had missed in all those years, wrapped in a cocoon of safety, didn\u2019t bear thinking about.</p><p>Now here, out of the blue, like a miracle, was a man who\u2019d gently pushed and prodded his way past the barriers of her resolve. A man who hadn\u2019t asked her to stop loving Jeff. He hadn\u2019t attempted to push her dead husband out of her life. All he\u2019d asked was that she make room for him.</p><p>\u201cGlen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He reached for her hand, holding it lightly in his own.</p><p>Where she found the courage, she didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t question. All at once it was there, like the warming rays of dawn at the end of a long, cold night. \u201cWould you like to marry me?\u201d</p><p>At first her words were met with a shock-filled silence. Glen looked at her as if he suspected he hadn\u2019t heard her correctly. \u201cDid you just say what I think you did?\u201d</p><p>Jody had never been more embarrassed in her life. She hadn\u2019t a clue what had prompted her to ask such a thing. All at once the thought was there, and the words had tumbled from her lips like awkward chunks of ice over the edge of a pitcher. She wanted to reach out and jerk back the question, but before she had a chance to do or say anything more, Glen spoke.</p><p>\u201cI would consider it the greatest honor of my life to be your husband and Timmy\u2019s stepfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have,\u201d Glen interrupted with feeling. \u201cI just never dreamed this would happen so soon.\u201d He looked at his watch once more and she could see the regret work its way into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cSet the date, Jody. We can shop for an engagement ring this weekend.\u201d How eager he sounded, how pleased.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t such a crazy idea after all. She\u2019d waited so long and here was an opportunity of a lifetime. Here was a chance of finding happiness and she was grabbing hold of it with both hands.</p><p>Yes, it was happening so fast, but that was the way she wanted it. If she had too much time to think about remarrying, she might find an excuse to change her mind.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get married in January, after the holidays,\u201d she blurted out, as Glen headed for the door.</p><p>He turned around and flashed her a smile that rivaled the noonday sun. \u201cJanuary it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Shirley did a leap into the air off the filing cabinet, both hands raised in jubilation. A stack of papers went flying in all directions and Jody whirled around.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked as the papers fluttered to the ground.</p><p>Another woman in the office said, \u201cIt\u2019s that damn heating vent. It sends out a rush of hot air every now and again.\u201d She rolled her chair over to Jody. \u201cHere, let me help you pick those up.\u201d</p><p>Jody looked up and frowned. The heating vent wasn\u2019t anywhere near the filing cabinet.</p><p>Shirley stayed plastered against the ceiling, her hands covering her mouth. \u201cOops,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think we should contact the maintenance man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw,\u201d the other woman said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen that often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jody murmured, \u201clook at this. It\u2019s a feather. How do you suppose a feather got in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got a clue,\u201d her friend said, handing her a stack of papers.</p><p>Shirley left before she caused any further damage and ascended directly toward the golden light of heaven, exhilarated with this unexpected turn of events.</p><p>To her delight Gabriel was waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d he greeted her. He was a magnificent angel, tall and regal looking, an impressive sight after a steady stream of men of the earth. For a fraction of a second Shirley admired the strength and power exuding from him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to report about Timmy Potter?\u201d Gabriel asked in a no-nonsense tone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Shirley said, nodding. \u201cMy mission\u2019s accomplished, Timmy\u2019s mother became engaged to Glen Richardson this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlen Richardson,\u201d Gabriel repeated. He walked over to the desk where the cumbersome volume was stored and flipped open the thick book. He ran his finger down the page until he found Glen\u2019s name, then looked up at Shirley and frowned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful man and will make Timmy an excellent father,\u201d Shirley hurried to say. She strained her eyes to read what Gabriel seemed to question, but wasn\u2019t able to see anything beyond the archangel\u2019s massive hand.</p><p>\u201cYou need to return to earth right away,\u201d Gabriel continued. \u201cThere\u2019s been some misunderstanding. Jody and Timmy are going to need you. The winds of trouble are brewing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me anything more than that?\u201d Shirley asked. She should have known it wouldn\u2019t be this easy, especially since she was so new at this.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more I can tell you,\u201d Gabriel said, and she heard the regret in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Gabriel said, spreading his massive wings. \u201cYou have work to do.\u201d</p><p>For years Leah had avoided the infant sections of department stores. Now she found herself drawn to them as if a magnet were luring her in their direction.</p><p>She was supposed to be Christmas shopping, instead she wandered about looking at beautifully crafted cribs, lovingly running her hand over the polished wood railings. The joy that blossomed in her heart was strong.</p><p>She was going to have a baby.</p><p>After all these years she was about to bear a child. Her waiting, her pain had come to pass.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s words of warning echoed harshly in the back of her mind. How she wished she could find some way to explain the deep certainty she experienced. She yearned to rub away his doubts and lend him the assurance she\u2019d felt from that very first morning.</p><p>Soon she would be able to look him in the eye and tell him her body was nurturing his seed. For years she\u2019d carried this dream with her, of watching her husband\u2019s expression when she told him he would soon be a father.</p><p>Nothing could have pleased her more than to purchase a complete layette right then and there, but she didn\u2019t want to risk another confrontation with Andrew. They had all the baby furniture they\u2019d ever need in storage. Once Dr. Benoit had confirmed her pregnancy, there\u2019d be plenty of time to set up a nursery.</p><p>Her appointment wasn\u2019t until the twenty-third, but she was fortunate to get one as quickly as that, so she wasn\u2019t complaining. Seeing the doctor that close to Christmas had its advantages. That way she wouldn\u2019t need to wait long to make the announcement to both sets of parents. If she saw Dr. Benoit any sooner, she\u2019d never have been able to keep the happy news to herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andrew\u2019s mother would be thrilled. Her own, too, of course, but her parents had plenty of grandchildren, while Shirley Lundberg impatiently waited for her first.</p><p>Leah had had names picked out for years. If they had a girl her name would be either Sarah, Hannah, or Elizabeth. A son would be named Isaac, Samuel, or John. Few understood the significance or what had prompted her decision.</p><p>The names were Biblical. Leah shared a good deal in common with the three women. Sarah, Hannah, and Elizabeth had been barren too, but God had heard their prayers and answered them with the birth of their firstborn child. As it happened, all three were boys, and those were the names she\u2019d chosen for her own child, should she bear a son.</p><p>Deep in her heart, Leah felt this child was a miracle. He was a testament to faith. Over the years her hope had grown weak and faltered, but God had listened. He\u2019d heard her cries. Even when it seemed all that was returned to her was the echo of her own sobs, God had been faithful.</p> <p>Unable to leave the infant department without purchasing one small item, Leah opted for a beautiful sterling silver Christmas tree ornament for Andrew with Baby\u2019s First Christmas beautifully inscribed in the silver. Technically she was a year early, but she was eager for Andrew\u2019s reaction when he opened this gift. By then he\u2019d know for certain she was pregnant.</p><p>As she suspected, her husband was waiting for her when she arrived home from her Christmas shopping spree. He trailed behind her from the garage all the way into the guest bedroom, where she stored the unwrapped gifts.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the shopping go?\u201d he asked, following close on her heels.</p><p>Leah set her purchases on the bed and tossed him a saucy smile over her shoulder. \u201cVery well, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you buy me anything?\u201d One thing she\u2019d always loved about Andrew was his childlike attitude toward Christmas. He was like a little kid about presents. He played silly guessing games with her, checked out the packages under the tree as often as he dared, and shook his gifts until they were in danger of being broken.</p> <p>\u201cI might have found you something,\u201d she answered cryptically, \u201cand then again I might not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d he said, sounding confident. He leaned against the doorway and cupped his hands behind his head, as if he had it all figured out. His pose suggested that she needn\u2019t wrap the gifts since he knew everything she\u2019d bought anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou were gone a long time,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d she said, bringing the Christmas wrap out from the closet.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew, honestly!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you know the golf store was having a sale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does it,\u201d Leah said, throwing her arms in the air. \u201cScoot. I\u2019m going to wrap these and I can\u2019t do it with you standing over my shoulder watching every move I make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you have some great moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew, please, I\u2019m serious. Scoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha. So you did buy me something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, darling.\u201d She walked over to the door and closed it. The latch clicked softly into place.</p><p>Andrew stood stubbornly on the other side, refusing to leave. \u201cYou\u2019ll call me if you need anything, right?\u201d he asked, sounding downright cordial.</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat.\u201d</p> <p>A minute passed, perhaps two, but no longer. \u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. Andrew, why don\u2019t you go in and watch television for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing good\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about football?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe game\u2019s over. How long is it going to take you to finish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t rightly say.\u201d Was it any wonder family and friends made fun of her gift-wrapping efforts? She used more tape than any three people. She couldn\u2019t wrap a single gift without being hounded by her husband, who behaved more like a six-year-old than a mature adult.</p><p>A long, slow release of breath followed her announcement. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a cup of hot chocolate,\u201d he said, sounding as if he\u2019d lost his last friend.</p><p>\u201cMake two,\u201d she called out. She\u2019d finish up later. By some miracle she\u2019d managed to wrap everything she\u2019d purchased for him, including a box of golf balls. The man had a sixth sense when it came to ferreting out his gifts.</p><p>Andrew was carrying steaming mugs of hot chocolate into the living room by the time she\u2019d put everything away. They kicked off their shoes and snuggled up together on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s your doctor\u2019s appointment?\u201d Andrew asked, rubbing his chin along the side of her head. Leah was convinced she\u2019d told him no less than three times. \u201cThe twenty-third.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a couple of moments. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d Leah smiled to herself. He was becoming a believer. Bit by bit, little by little, as each day passed. Like her, he was afraid to believe. Like her, he couldn\u2019t make himself not do so.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I was thinking this afternoon?\u201d she said, tilting back her head so their eyes could meet. \u201cI\u2019d like to start attending church services again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I realized it\u2019s been months since we last went to church. Far too long, and you know what? I miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved singing Christmas carols,\u201d Andrew said wistfully.</p><p>Leah nearly choked on her hot chocolate. \u201cYou can\u2019t sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he admitted readily, his eyes bright with silent laughter, \u201cbut that never stopped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d She loved to tease him. It felt good to be together like this. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind then if we went back to church?\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers. \u201cWhy should I? I think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Leah nestled back into the warm security of his arms.</p><p>\u201cIt seems we have a good deal to be grateful for lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>The moment was peaceful and serene and Leah happily traipsed along the meandering path of her thoughts. They led her on the same well-traveled road she\u2019d traversed so often, trying to picture what Andrew\u2019s and her child would be like. She hoped, boy or girl, that their baby would inherit her husband\u2019s love of life, his excitement and joy for the little things.</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d he said after a moment, \u201cdo you still believe you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I am. It\u2019s there\u2014that confident feeling inside me. We\u2019re going to have a child, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize you\u2019ve got me believing it now too, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and that\u2019s even better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis could be dangerous thinking for us both. We might be setting ourselves up for another major disappointment, and I don\u2019t think either one of us can take many more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t,\u201d she assured him, not doubting, not even for an instant. \u201cHere, feel,\u201d she said, taking the hot chocolate and setting it aside. Then, reaching for his hand, she pressed his palm against her stomach, holding it there, her fingers pressed over his. \u201cNow tell me what you believe.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for what seemed like an eternity before he wrapped his arms around her and brought her tight against him, holding her as if he were suddenly afraid and needed someone to cling to.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered, and when they kissed she realized he was trembling.</p><p>\u201cMonica,\u201d her father said, walking into the living room, his look contemplative. \u201cMichael called again.\u201d</p><p>The needle was poised in her fingers, ready to pierce the linen fabric. \u201cI don\u2019t feel much like talking, Dad. Would you make my excuses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI explained you were a little under the weather.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the thread through the material. \u201cThank you.\u201d The needlepoint was a means of occupying her mind, but she doubted that she\u2019d ever finish this project. The Ten Commandments were filled with Thou Shalt Not and that was the way she\u2019d viewed life. Her views had subtly changed, thanks to knowing Chet.</p><p>Her father claimed his favorite chair across from her and reached for his Bible. He opened it and silently read for several moments before he gently closed the yellowed pages and set the leather-bound book aside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited now for three days for you to tell me why you\u2019re so low. I don\u2019t know that I have the patience to hold out much longer.\u201d</p><p>Monica set aside the needlepoint, not knowing where to begin or how. The pain was too fresh yet, too raw. She lowered her gaze to her lap and clenched her hands together. Her father was a patient man, and she prayed he\u2019d understand her hesitation.</p><p>He gave her a few moments, then leaned toward her and gently patted her knee. \u201cIt\u2019s at times like these that I wish your mother were alive. She\u2019d be much better at understanding what\u2019s wrong than I am. Funny, isn\u2019t it,\u201d he said with a sad sort of laugh, \u201cI counsel people from all walks of life and I can\u2019t help my own daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, love. If it will make it easier, you don\u2019t need to tell me there\u2019s a man involved in all this. I have eyes in my head. In the beginning I believed it was Michael, but it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s not the one.\u201d He reached for his handkerchief and methodically cleaned his glasses. \u201cI apologize for playing the role of the matchmaker with you two. I should have known better. I\u2019m an old man who would like grandchildren someday.\u201d</p><p>Monica closed her eyes to a fresh wave of pain. Now there would be no children, because there was no Chet. It was melodramatic to think she would never fall in love again, never marry. But right then that was exactly how she felt.</p><p>\u201cWhoever this young man is I\u2019d like to thank him,\u201d her father continued after a lengthy silence.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know him, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>She was forever grateful he didn\u2019t play a game of cat and mouse, attempting to guess Chet\u2019s identity.</p><p>\u201cFor the first time since you entered your twenties you\u2019ve taken your eyes off yourself. You\u2019ve worked so hard to do the right thing, to be the perfect example of God\u2019s love to others. Soon you focused all your efforts on yourself and how good you were. It was then that you started to notice the flaws in others. It became a vicious circle and I couldn\u2019t seem to reach you with the truth.\u201d</p><p>Monica raised her gaze to his. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me for sounding like the preacher I am. You\u2019re my only child and I love you more than words can say, but there\u2019ve been times I wanted to take you by the shoulders and shake you good and hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Although she asked the question, Monica was well aware of the answer.</p><p>\u201cFor standing in judgment of others instead of trying to look at them through God\u2019s eyes,\u201d her father continued.</p><p>\u201cThe man, his . . . his name is Chet,\u201d she whispered, feeling she owed her father some explanation. \u201cI met him downtown, the first time the ensemble sang. He was going into a tavern and I tried to stop him by telling him how wrong it was for him to drink.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her father smiled at that and settled back in his chair. \u201cI suspect he didn\u2019t listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, quite the opposite. He laughed.\u201d She did too then, at the memory. Softly, sadly. \u201cWe met again by accident later and several times more by design.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand what it was I found so intriguing about him. He\u2019s not like anyone I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been raised in the church. Your experience with the world has been limited.\u201d</p> <p>She reached for a tissue and twisted it between her fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s a former policeman and has lived a hard life. He\u2019s done things neither of us would ever dream of doing. He\u2019s been shot and sometimes carries a gun, although he doesn\u2019t realize I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first glance he looks rough and mean,\u201d she hurried to explain, \u201cbut on the inside . . . I don\u2019t think I could have found a better man to love. He was honest when he didn\u2019t need to be, and gentle. There were any number of times he could have seduced me and didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>The strain in her father\u2019s voice produced a small smile. She shouldn\u2019t have told him that part. Any father would have reacted the same.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s so damn noble I could cry . . . and have,\u201d she said, clenching her fists.</p><p>\u201cI take it he\u2019s the one who insisted you not see each other again?\u201d</p><p>Monica nodded. \u201cHe never said he loved me, but I know he does. He loves me so much he was willing to send me away rather than take the chance of hurting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica,\u201d her father pleaded, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you bring him to meet me?\u201d</p><p>It was a question that had plagued her as well. One she\u2019d repeatedly asked herself the last few days. Chet had claimed he wanted it to end before there were more regrets, but she\u2019d stewed in them for days. She feared Chet had assumed she was ashamed of him and that simply wasn\u2019t the case.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t introduce you. I guess I was afraid you\u2019d think ill of him, or me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, Monica, you love this man. That would have been enough of a character endorsement for me. Your mother and I raised you and if you can\u2019t judge a man\u2019s worth by now then you wouldn\u2019t be our daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad, I wish I\u2019d done so many things differently and now it\u2019s too late. Forgive me for not trusting you. I\u2019ve been wrong about so much.\u201d</p><p>Her father patted her knee once more. \u201cThere\u2019s a special man for you. Remember how hurt you were when you learned Patrick was engaged.\u201d</p><p>Patrick. She\u2019d nearly forgotten about him. It was laughable to think she\u2019d been anything close to loving her former boyfriend. Her pride had been hurt at Patrick\u2019s surprise announcement. Far more than her ego was involved this time, and Monica sincerely doubted that she\u2019d ever be the same again.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cHey, man, you don\u2019t look so good,\u201d Lou, the Blue Goose bartender said as he poured Chet another shot glass of Kentucky bourbon.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a pretty face,\u201d Chet muttered, \u201ccall Trixie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got the flu?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Chet said, thinking that would get Lou off his back. He wasn\u2019t interested in company or conversation.</p><p>\u201cThen get the hell out of here,\u201d Lou continued. \u201cNo one wants to be sick for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Christmas. It was just another day like all the others as far as Chet was concerned. Christmas was for families and he didn\u2019t have one. No one bought him gifts, and there certainly wasn\u2019t anyone he cared enough to buy one for other than . . . His thoughts came to a grinding halt.</p><p>Funny how a woman could mess up a man\u2019s mind. He\u2019d known Monica what . . . two, three weeks? He\u2019d lost count and within that short amount of time she\u2019d managed to worm her way into his heart until she was like a virus that had spread to every part of his body.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t eat or sleep for want of her. He couldn\u2019t close his eyes without his head filling up with thoughts of her. Nor could he get the image of her out of his mind. The one of her standing at the end of the pier, the wind ruffling her hair, her beautiful eyes bright with tears . . . and love. A love so damn strong it was like a torchlight beaming directly at him.</p><p>That final picture of her would haunt him to the grave. He didn\u2019t know how he was going to get through the rest of his life without her.</p><p>The rest of his life. Chet nearly laughed out loud. What life? That was the real question. He was sick to death of the endless lies, the constant need for charades, flirting with disaster.</p><p>That\u2019s how it\u2019d started with Monica. A game, because she irritated him. One diversion too many and this time he was paying the piper in spades.</p><p>The empty days stretched out before him, followed by cruel nights staked out in some dark alley or a cheap hotel room crawling with loneliness.</p><p>The rest of his life was reserved in hell. He was born there and had spent a good majority of his carelessly lived existence there, except for one brief furlough with a preacher\u2019s daughter. Just long enough for him to taste what could have been his, so he\u2019d know exactly what it was he\u2019d thrown away.</p><p>He emptied his drink, slapped the money down on the bar, and stood. The room spun and he shook his head, hoping that would help. It was too damn early in the afternoon to be drunk.</p><p>When he left the Blue Goose the cold hit him like a sharp claw. He squinted in the sunlight, cursing it as much as he cursed himself. The only person he had to blame for this was himself.</p><p>This was what he got for involving himself with a missionary. He\u2019d known from the first time he kissed Monica that something like this would happen. It hadn\u2019t stopped him from seeing her again. It hadn\u2019t stopped him from caring. Nor had it stopped him from nearly screwing up her life.</p><p>The walk back to his office did him good. He was beginning to think he might be able to pull himself together and accomplish something by the end of the day, when he strolled past the department store window. Santa was there, and a long line of kids were waiting for him to listen to their wish lists. A little boy was squirming in his lap.</p><p>Something about the kid reached out and grabbed Chet by the gut. Perhaps it was the boy\u2019s eyes, maybe it was the color of the kid\u2019s hair, which was close to his own. It came to Chet then as unwelcome pain. If his life had been different, he might have had a son.</p><p>That fantasy along with everything else had been destroyed years ago when he\u2019d been brash and naive enough to believe in justice and truth. Years ago before Tom was murdered, before he hadn\u2019t been able to save his partner.</p><p>He forced himself to keep walking until he reached his building. His office lacked welcome, but Chet had wasted enough time already. He had work to do.</p><p>He sorted through his mail and tossed it unopened into the garbage. Reaching over the top of his desk, he pushed the button for his answering machine. A series of impersonal beeps followed. No one wanted him, not even his clients.</p><p>What he needed, Chet decided, was a change of scene. He should have left this stinking city years ago. Now that he thought about it, he wasn\u2019t sure what it was that had prompted him to stay.</p><p>His mind made up, he pulled the phone from its jack, stuck it in the bottom desk drawer, and then searched through his filing cabinet for his lease, wishing he could remember the terms.</p><p>A knock sounded at his door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s open,\u201d he shouted, shuffling though his papers. He made decent money, but had never gotten around to hiring himself a secretary. He wished now that he had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Chet Costello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found him.\u201d He looked up and damn near swallowed his tongue. It was Monica\u2019s father.</p><p>Lloyd Fischer grinned in recognition. \u201cSo it was you? I was guessing, you see. Monica didn\u2019t give me your surname. Then again, I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Reverend Fischer?\u201d Chet asked crisply. He wasn\u2019t going to put up with an interrogation. Fact was, he wasn\u2019t up to much more of anything.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working at the Mission House,\u201d the older man explained, looking around the room. His eyes revealed neither approval nor disapproval, just mild curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Chet pressed a second time.</p><p>The question seemed to take the reverend by surprise and he reverted his attention to Chet. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure. Would you mind if I sat down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just on my way out.\u201d The last thing Chet wanted was a lengthy conversation with Monica\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t take more than a couple of minutes,\u201d he said, and helped himself to a chair.</p><p>The reverend was being deliberately obtuse, and Chet gritted his teeth with impatience.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you saw my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTuesday.\u201d Chet made a point of looking at his watch as if he needed to be someplace important soon. \u201cIf Monica didn\u2019t give you my name, how\u2019d you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read your license, remember?\u201d</p><p>He was losing it, Chet mused. He\u2019d forgotten the old coot had caught him coming out of the side yard that night and had asked to see his identification.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter\u2019s badly hurt, you know.\u201d</p><p>For one wild second Chet assumed Monica had been injured and the fear that seared through him burned hotter than the bullet he\u2019d taken years earlier.</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s tough and then you die,\u201d Chet stated unemotionally.</p><p>The man grinned as if he easily saw through Chet\u2019s ploy. The grin irritated Chet. \u201cListen, I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica claims you love her. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The pain of the lie pricked his heart, but he ignored it. \u201cListen, if you\u2019re worried about what happened between us, let me assure you nothing did. Now, if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019ve got an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose you do,\u201d the reverend said, slowly getting to his feet. He extended his hand. \u201cIt was a pleasure meeting you, young man. It\u2019s plain to see why Monica thinks so highly of you.\u201d</p><p>Chet\u2019s chest tightened with a crippling ache as they exchanged hand shakes. \u201cYou should be beating the hell out of me for having ever touched your daughter.\u201d</p><p>The other man\u2019s eyes gentled as he slowly shook his head. \u201cI was young once myself, you know, and deeply in love. Monica\u2019s a woman and old enough to know her own heart. I\u2019m not here to judge you or my daughter. I came out of curiosity to meet you. And thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank me?\u201d Lloyd Fischer was offering him gratitude when Chet had expected condemnation.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, you\u2019ve helped Monica tremendously.\u201d The minister looked older now than he had when Chet first saw him the fateful day he\u2019d met Monica. Weary and burdened. \u201cIf there\u2019s ever anything I can do for you,\u201d he continued, \u201cplease don\u2019t hesitate to come see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Chet said, but a man who\u2019d lived the life he\u2019d lived, and done the things he had, didn\u2019t make social calls to preachers.</p><p>He walked Monica\u2019s father to the door, and opened it for him, anxious for him to leave. If Lloyd Fischer stayed much longer, Chet just might start to believe in the impossible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll get over me,\u201d he said.</p><p>The older man nodded. \u201cI suspect you\u2019re right. In due time. She loves you, and Monica\u2019s a good deal like her mother when it comes to love.\u201d</p><p>Chet hadn\u2019t a clue what that meant and furthermore he didn\u2019t want to know. His ladle of guilt was filled to capacity and overflowing.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Chet. I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me.\u201d He patted Chet\u2019s upper arm as if he were little more than a schoolboy and then ambled out of the room.</p> <p>Standing in the doorway, Chet watched as Monica\u2019s father absently walked down the hallway, strolling past the elevator. He turned around, looking confused, when he reached the end of the hall.</p><p>Chet shut the door, leaned against the thick white glass, and closed his eyes. He smelled of stale beer, hadn\u2019t shaved in two days, and as a general rule looked like crap, and this man of God had thanked him for damn near deflowering his daughter.</p><p>There was something screwy somewhere, and the hell if Chet could figure out where.</p><p>He was dizzy again and decided it was probably due to the fact that he hadn\u2019t eaten since the day before. The alcohol hadn\u2019t helped.</p><p>After showering and fixing himself something to eat he felt better. He\u2019d finished his scrambled eggs when the thought subtly presented itself to him. Monica was at the Mission House. Hadn\u2019t her father said so himself?</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chet said out loud. \u201cI will not go down there.\u201d He reached for his television controller, his finger poised over the Power button.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool,\u201d Chet muttered, already knowing there was no force on this earth that could keep him away.</p><p>He had no intention of talking to her. None. The picture windows in the place gave ample opportunity to view the inside without being noticed. He\u2019d go down, check out what her father had said, and slip away without anyone being the wiser. It was something he\u2019d done a thousand times before as part of his job. He was good at this sort of thing.</p><p>With purpose directing him, Chet locked up his office, and when the elevator didn\u2019t arrive fast enough to suit him, he took the stairs.</p><p>The mission was only a few doors away from his own building. It amazed Chet how easily he was able to find Monica in the crowd of workers. There seemed to be some sort of Christmas party going on. He spied Lloyd Fischer serving turkey with all the trimmings to a long line of derelicts.</p><p>Monica was in another part of the room with the children. Apparently she was telling them a story. A handful of kids were sitting on the floor looking up at the book she was holding. A toddler was fidgeting in her lap, reaching for her dangly earrings.</p> <p>This was what hell must be like, Chet decided. To stand hidden in some corner and view the woman he loved so much it defied reason, and know he would never have her. Hell was watching her hold a child in her arms, and realizing she would never hold their child.</p><p>She was pale, Chet realized with regret, and dark circles shadowed her eyes. No wonder her father was concerned. Monica wasn\u2019t faring any better than Chet was himself. He wanted to shake some reason into her, but that was part of his hell too. He would never touch her again.</p><p>Coming here had not been one of his most brilliant ideas. He took a step back, and then another, and was ready to turn and walk away when Monica\u2019s gaze suddenly, unexplainably, locked with his.</p><p>Chet read her shock and watched the book she was holding tumble unnoticed from her fingers and fall to the floor.</p><p>Chet\u2019s heart faltered. He couldn\u2019t turn and walk away. Then she\u2019d know his game. Then she\u2019d know he\u2019d purposely been spying on her. He had to do something and do it fast.</p><p>His shoes made harsh sounds against the sidewalk as he slammed into the Mission House door. He walked past the soup kitchen and moved directly to where Monica was sitting with the children. He braced his feet and glared down at her, sneering.</p><p>\u201cTell your father to stay away from me,\u201d he ordered coolly.</p><p>Monica\u2019s eyes widened with shock.</p> <p>Not giving her a chance to recover, he turned and walked out, leaving the door to slam in his wake.</p><p>Jody let herself into the house that evening, same time as always. Timmy was sitting on the carpet in the family room, occupied with his video game.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d she told him, walking into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d he called out. \u201cGrandma called.\u201d</p><p>Jody\u2019s blood ran cold. \u201cGrandma Potter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She wants you to call her right away. She said\u2014oh, darn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Jody asked, hoping to hide her anxiety. It was times such as this that she regretted ever having purchased Timmy the video game system.</p><p>\u201cGrandma said if you didn\u2019t call her right away that she would call you.\u201d</p><p>Jody wasn\u2019t up to another confrontation with Gloria.</p><p>\u201cGlen\u2019s coming over for dinner,\u201d Jody announced, watching for her son\u2019s reaction, hoping to gain confidence in his enthusiasm to spend more time with the attorney. \u201cI thought I\u2019d make spaghetti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. He\u2019ll like that.\u201d Timmy\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t waver from the television screen, his attention rapt.</p><p>Inviting Glen to dinner so they could talk to Timmy together about their engagement had been Glen\u2019s idea. Jody had immediately seen the wisdom of it, although now she wished she\u2019d discussed the matter of her remarrying with her son much sooner.</p><p>Jody didn\u2019t doubt that Timmy would be thrilled. After all, this was what he wanted. His nine-year-old heart had yearned for a father, and his desire was what opened her eyes to the way she\u2019d isolated her life.</p><p>\u201cYou want to help me set the table?\u201d she asked, although it was an hour or longer before they\u2019d eat.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d</p><p>Jody rolled her eyes. She\u2019d heard that phrase often enough to have it etched into the patio walkway.</p><p>Seeing that she wasn\u2019t going to get much conversation from her son, she fried the ground turkey and set the sauce to simmer. Once she\u2019d finished, she reached for the phone and dialed her mother\u2019s number. If ever she needed emotional support it was now.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJody, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to unburden her soul, nor could she very well announce that she\u2019d decided to marry Glen within earshot of Timmy. But she could tell her about Gloria\u2019s call.</p><p>\u201cMy guess is that Gloria wants to apologize, dear,\u201d her mother said, after Jody finished. \u201cShe was hurt and angry and said something she didn\u2019t mean, and now she\u2019s looking to make amends.\u201d</p><p>Jody was sure her mother was right, but needed confirmation before returning the call, and said as much.</p><p>\u201cYou need to remember,\u201d Helen continued, \u201cyou and Timmy are the only relatives she has left. I\u2019m sure she regrets everything and would like to mend fences. The Christmas gifts you mailed probably arrived and they were the perfect excuse for her to contact you. She means well, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell sounded and Jody glanced at her watch. \u201cThat must be Glen,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cI do like that young man,\u201d her mother announced, and after a quick word in parting, Jody hung up the phone.</p><p>Her guess proved correct. Glen stood on the other side of the door, a bottle of wine in his hand and a bouquet of red rosebuds in the other. He kissed her on the cheek and handed her both.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Timmy?\u201d Glen asked as she arranged the roses in a crystal vase.</p><p>\u201cPreoccupied,\u201d Jody whispered.</p><p>Glen\u2019s arm circled her waist as they returned to the kitchen. When Timmy noticed Glen had arrived, he turned off the game.</p><p>\u201cHi, Glen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, scout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I guess. Mom said you were coming over for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Timmy said, \u201cI think it\u2019s great, but she made spaghetti and she makes me eat it with a spoon. She\u2019ll probably make you do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can live with that, if you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Timmy said.</p><p>\u201cSon, Glen and I would like to have a talk with you before dinner.\u201d Rubbing her palms together as if warding off a chill, Jody looked at Glen for assistance. They hadn\u2019t talked about when they\u2019d break the news to Timmy, and Jody worried their dinner would be a disaster with this hanging over their heads.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Timmy said.</p><p>The three of them sat down together in the family room. Glen was next to Jody and Timmy sat across from them. Glen reached for Jody\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYour mother and I talked this afternoon and decided that we like each other very much,\u201d Glen explained.</p><p>\u201cI kind of guessed that you did,\u201d Timmy said. \u201cI saw you kissing her once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that trouble you?\u201d Jody asked, watching her son for any telltale signs of jealousy. Although Timmy yearned for a father, he may not have understood that it would mean having to share his mother\u2019s attention with someone else.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why people kiss on the lips,\u201d Timmy said. \u201cIt\u2019s seems silly when you\u2019re always warning me about germs, but adults seem to like it and even some kids. Rich told me he kissed a girl and it wasn\u2019t too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how do you feel about me and your mother kissing?\u201d Glen pressed.</p><p>Timmy frowned as if he didn\u2019t know how to answer. \u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Glen\u2019s hand tightened around Jody\u2019s. She noticed for the first time that he was nervous, which was something she suspected happened only rarely. Her gaze met his and he smiled weakly.</p><p>\u201cGlen and I want to talk to you about us getting married,\u201d Jody said, surprised by how shallow her voice sounded. Saying the words aloud for the first time caused her heart to pound at a fast rate, as if she were walking up a steep hill. In many ways she was, and the anticipation of this new path she\u2019d chosen suddenly felt momentous.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean we\u2019d be a family?\u201d</p><p>Jody nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be your stepfather,\u201d Glen explained.</p><p>Timmy frowned at that. \u201cBut we\u2019d still be a family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we would. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d Jody sensed Timmy\u2019s uncertainty and wanted to reassure him that there was nothing on this earth that would ever change her love for him.</p><p>\u201cWould you have more babies like Rich\u2019s mom?\u201d</p><p>Jody released her breath and looked at Glen. They hadn\u2019t discussed the prospect of having children.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that very much,\u201d Glen answered for her. \u201cBut we\u2019ll leave the decision up to your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Timmy, would you like it if Glen and I married?\u201d Jody experienced the strongest need to break down and cry. It felt like a band around her chest that tightened more with each second.</p><p>\u201cSure, that would be great. Glen could help me be a better pitcher and then you wouldn\u2019t miss my dad so much. It\u2019d be nice to be part of a real family.\u201d</p><p>Jody bit back the words that claimed they were already a real family, he and she together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled, then,\u201d Glen said, \u201cyour mother and I are officially engaged. You know what this means now, don\u2019t you, Timmy? Another set of grandparents and aunts and uncles that you\u2019ll need to meet.\u201d He placed his arm around Jody\u2019s shoulder and squeezed gently.</p><p>The phone pealed just then and Jody knew in her heart that it was her mother-in-law. Bracing herself, she stood and reached for the phone.</p><p>Her guess was accurate.</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize for our conversation the other night,\u201d Gloria said, sounding calm and collected. It was almost as if the fog in her mind had cleared.</p> <p>\u201cWe both said things we regret,\u201d Jody assured her. \u201cThis is a difficult time for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Gloria corrected, \u201cyou\u2019re wrong, my dear. Life couldn\u2019t be more beautiful. Christmas has always been my favorite time of year, and more so now than ever before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine too. Remember the year you joined Timmy and me. We wish your health was better so you could travel more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff always enjoyed the holidays,\u201d she said.</p><p>Discussing her dead husband just then, minutes after she\u2019d announced her engagement to another man, was more than Jody could bear.</p> <p>\u201cMom, there\u2019s something you should know,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cSomething wonderful has happened and other than Timmy you\u2019re the first one to hear.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to announce her engagement like this, but she couldn\u2019t think of any other way to divert Gloria from speaking about Jeff.</p><p>\u201cYou do sound excited and rightly so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you earlier I\u2019d met another man.\u201d</p><p>Jody waited for some acknowledgment but none came. \u201cWe decided we want to be married,\u201d Jody said, \u201cand have set the date for January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried!\u201d Gloria shrieked. \u201cBut you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t! What about Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Jeff were alive why wouldn\u2019t he contact me or Timmy?\u201d she asked reasonably.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been very sick and weak. I haven\u2019t talked to him myself yet, but the German official told me he\u2019s recovering and asking about you and Timmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, give me the phone number of the person you\u2019re talking to and I\u2019ll contact him myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear, I don\u2019t have it. But everything he\u2019s said is true, I swear it\u2019s true, Jeff\u2019s alive. You\u2019ve got to believe me. You\u2019ve got to break your engagement before Jeff learns you\u2019re involved with another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, this is a cruel hoax. We buried Jeff, remember?\u201d Jody gently reminded her.</p><p>It was as if Gloria hadn\u2019t heard her. \u201cWhat am I supposed to tell my son when he phones? I demand that you tell this other man you\u2019ve changed your mind. No, no, I\u2019ll tell him for you. He\u2019ll listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please,\u201d Jody pleaded, her voice low and trembling.</p><p>Glen was standing next to her then, his arm around his shoulder. Gently he took the receiver from her hand, and explained that he was the man Jody was marrying. Naturally she couldn\u2019t hear her former mother-in-law\u2019s response.</p><p>Jody turned into his arm and buried her face in his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cGrandma thinks my dad\u2019s alive?\u201d Timmy asked, when Glen had hung up the receiver.</p><p>Jody was trembling too hard to respond. Glen continued to hold her, patting her back. \u201cYour grandmother wants it to be true so badly that she\u2019s convinced herself your father is still alive,\u201d Glen explained, when it was apparent Jody was in no condition to do so.</p><p>Somehow they made it through dinner, although the three of them took turns attempting to make a festive occasion of it. Glen tried the hardest. Timmy made an effort as well, and Jody too, however feeble. She was grateful when Glen claimed he was working on the brief for an important case and left shortly after they\u2019d finished clearing the table.</p><p>Jody walked him to the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Gloria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, pressing his forehead to hers. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her gently.</p><p>Jody let him out the door and watched until Glen\u2019s car was out of sight. He was a good man, a decent man, but she didn\u2019t feel any great passion for him. She smiled sadly and realized she\u2019d been lucky enough to know about love from Jeff. Love wasn\u2019t the reason she and Glen had decided to marry. They cared deeply for each other, shared the same goals, and were comfortable with one another. A lot of marriages had far less.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with my homework,\u201d Timmy said some time later. Jody had finished the dishes and was busy writing out Christmas cards. She was later than usual this year.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling everyone about Glen?\u201d Timmy surprised her by asking. He reached for the top card and read her brief note.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d send out announcements later. I\u2019ve already mailed out half my cards and it doesn\u2019t seem fair that half my friends know and half don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Timmy nodded as if her reasoning made perfect sense to him. He plopped his elbows on the table and tucked his chin in his hands as he watched her work.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked absently, thinking he was about to add another item to his detailed Christmas list.</p><p>\u201cI wish what Grandma Potter said was true. I wish my dad was alive.\u201d</p><p>Jody\u2019s hand stilled as her fingers tightened around the pen. \u201cI do too, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d Shirley said, looking anxiously to Goodness. \u201cGabriel insists the winds of trouble are brewing, but I can\u2019t see it. Jody\u2019s engaged and from everything I can see Glen Richardson is a perfect match for her and Timmy.\u201d</p><p>Goodness, who was poised atop the Christmas tree, slowly shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know very much about humans and love, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter tracking Monica and Chet I could write a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Jody and Glen?\u201d Shirley asked impatiently. \u201cThey\u2019re great friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed, and that\u2019s a great place to start a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to tell me Jody\u2019s still in love with Jeff, I\u2019ll agree with you. Good grief, I never dreamed this assignment would be so difficult. I do everything Gabriel wants and then he sends me hightailing it back to earth, claiming trouble\u2019s afoot. But he won\u2019t tell me where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious,\u201d Goodness said. \u201cGlen doesn\u2019t love her either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, I sincerely doubt that. Glen\u2019s crazy about Jody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the little boy,\u201d Goodness said gently. \u201cGlen\u2019s impatient for a family, and Jody has one ready-made for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d Shirley might have been new at this business, but she didn\u2019t doubt Glen\u2019s honorable intentions for an instant.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we check him out and see for ourselves,\u201d Goodness suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll help you and then maybe you can help me. I\u2019m having troubles of my own.\u201d</p><p>They left Timmy\u2019s house and had no problem locating Glen\u2019s. \u201cHe told her he was working on a brief,\u201d Shirley explained.</p><p>Glen was sitting at his desk, a pen poised in his hands, but he seemed to be having trouble. They watched for several moments while he did nothing more than stare into space.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Goodness whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He seems to be thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he know that will only get him into trouble?\u201d</p><p>Shirley smiled. \u201cI guess not. Look, he\u2019s opening a drawer.\u201d</p><p>Glen\u2019s shoulders heaved with a deep sigh as he removed a photograph from the bottom drawer. Goodness and Shirley looked over his shoulder. The photograph was that of a beautiful young woman with long black hair that cascaded over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your trouble,\u201d Goodness whispered. \u201cGlen\u2019s in love with another woman.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going to be easy. Monica had carefully steeled herself for the coming confrontation with Chet. She stood outside his office door, her heart pounding hard and fast.</p><p>Fervently she prayed she was doing the right thing. All she knew was that she couldn\u2019t leave matters between them the way they were.</p><p>She could hear movement and knew Chet was there. She drew in a deep breath, knocked, turned the door handle, and stepped inside.</p><p>Chet was standing in front of his file cabinet, tossing one file after the other into a large cardboard container. Boxes were piled high on every bit of available space. His desk was clear, and the infamous calendar was down.</p><p>He was moving. Leaving Seattle. Leaving her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be taking on any new\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly when he saw it was Monica. For one all-too-brief moment tenderness flashed in his eyes, but that was quickly replaced with practiced hardness. His gaze became sharp and dangerous like that of a cornered animal that was prepared to lash out in order to protect itself.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy father wanted me to apologize,\u201d she began haltingly. \u201cHe never intended to offend you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve apologized, now go.\u201d</p><p>What gave her to courage to stay, Monica would never know. \u201cWhy are you moving?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but continued working at a furious pace, lifting several thick folders at a time, carelessly tossing them into the box.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked, trying a different vein.</p><p>\u201cAway. Monica,\u201d her name was little more than a frustrated sigh, \u201cplease, just go. Don\u2019t make this any more difficult than it already is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed and he visibly relaxed at her words. \u201cIf you answer one question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he said with sharp impatience. \u201cLeave it at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Monica had honestly tried to accept that he wanted her out of his life. But no matter how hard she struggled to find acceptance none would come.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to debate the issue with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me why you don\u2019t want my love,\u201d she said forcefully. \u201cTell me what it is about me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with you. The problem is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me. I need to know.\u201d Despite her efforts to the contrary, her voice cracked with the strain of emotion.</p><p>Chet moved as if he were in pain, slowly and with difficulty. His back was to her as he stared out the window. Monica stayed where she was by the door, trembling and hating herself for subjecting them to this torment a second time.</p><p>The room seemed to spark with tension.</p><p>\u201cI know you love me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me believe you don\u2019t. There has to be something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good enough for you,\u201d he shouted. \u201cNow for the love of God get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cNot until you tell me why you aren\u2019t good enough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMonica, please.\u201d</p><p>She walked over and stood next to him. He was so close she could feel his frustration. It seemed to come off him in waves.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you good enough?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>Chet\u2019s hands were braced against the windowsill, his knuckles white. A war was being waged within him and the battle seemed to be a fierce one. When he turned to face her, his eyes were dull with pain.</p> <p>\u201cI murdered a man,\u201d he shouted. \u201cThere, you know, now leave.\u201d He pointed toward the door, his face growing red and angry. \u201cGet out of my life, understand, before I ruin yours too.\u201d</p><p>The force of his anger rocked her, but Monica stood her ground. \u201cI don\u2019t know the circumstances,\u201d she said shakily, \u201cbut if you killed him, then he must have deserved to die.\u201d</p><p>Chet jerked back as if she\u2019d slapped him.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019ve done, I\u2019ll always love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chet cried, and then reached for her, hauling her into his arms. The strength of his embrace all but crushed her, but Monica didn\u2019t care. There wasn\u2019t anyplace else she would rather be than with Chet. He seemed to be drinking in her softness, as if it were as vital to him in that moment as oxygen.</p> <p>After a short while, he released a harsh shudder and relaxed his hold enough for her to breathe comfortably. He brushed the hair from her temple and kissed her there. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you, too,\u201d he whispered brokenly.</p><p>It felt like heaven to be in his arms. For the first time in days Monica felt whole, as if the part of her that had been missing had been found.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right when you say he deserved to die. He was a drug lord and brought misery to thousands all for the sake of money and power. An easy death was too good for him. He deserved to suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you wanted by the police?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and laughed shortly. \u201cNo, I was too smart for that. I goaded him into a fight and I knew, being the weasel he was, he\u2019d go for his weapon. He did, but I was ready. After an investigation, it was decided that I acted in self-defense, but I knew the truth. I murdered him just as if I\u2019d waited in a dark alley and shot him in the back. He didn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gunshot wound,\u201d she said, flattening her hand over the scar on Chet\u2019s shoulder. She could feel it even through the material of his shirt. \u201cThat was when you were shot, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chet told her. \u201cNot then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe scared you, though, didn\u2019t he? Tell me what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that matters.\u201d He released her then abruptly as if he feared her touch, and backed away. \u201cYou got the answer you wanted, now go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Chet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Monica flinched. \u201cAll right, but there\u2019s something you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much more of this is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much, I promise you.\u201d Her voice wobbled a bit, but with the strength of her pride she managed to keep it under control. \u201cThere\u2019ll never be anyone who loves you more than I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMonica.\u201d He groaned. \u201cStop, please. This isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is for me, so do me the courtesy of listening. Someday you\u2019re going to look back on your life and regret this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I regret is not moving sooner. Another twenty-four hours and I would have been out of here. You couldn\u2019t have waited one stinking day for this, could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she threw back at him. She didn\u2019t know when the tears came, but she felt their moisture against her face and brushed them aside. \u201cI\u2019ll haunt you . . . or rather, my love will. I swear that\u2019s what will happen. It doesn\u2019t matter if you travel to the other side of the world, I\u2019ll be there. It\u2019s my face you\u2019ll see when you look at another woman. And . . . and when you sleep, I\u2019ll be there each and every night. You won\u2019t be able to close your eyes without thinking of me, without knowing you walked away from the one woman in all this world who loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Chet stormed, his hands knotted into tight fists. \u201cNext you\u2019re going to tell me that you\u2019re going to sacrifice your life for me. Listen, Monica, I don\u2019t want you sitting here, believing that something\u2019s going to happen that will change my mind. It\u2019s over, understand? Over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she whispered and her shoulders quivered. \u201cThat\u2019s what I came to tell you. I won\u2019t be waiting for you, I can\u2019t, Chet. I\u2019ve wasted too much of my life already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way I want it.\u201d</p><p>Jody had dreaded the office Christmas party for days. She never had been one who enjoyed these types of social gatherings, and generally didn\u2019t stay beyond the first few minutes. Glen, however, thought the party the ideal time to announce their engagement to their peers.</p><p>He\u2019d presented her with a lovely engagement ring, a solitaire diamond that was large enough to feel heavy and awkward on her finger. She\u2019d removed Jeff\u2019s wedding ring years earlier, not because of any desire to put that part of her life behind her, but to satisfy her parents. Both were worried about her and although she\u2019d hated it, she\u2019d placed the simple gold band in her jewelry box to appease them.</p><p>She could tell from the sounds drifting from the reception area that the party was underway. There were enough goodies to feed a small Third World country. Everyone had contributed something. Jody was guilty of overdoing it herself, bringing a large homemade cheese roll and several dozen gingerbread cookies Timmy had helped her bake the night before.</p><p>Her mother was watching Timmy, and insisted Jody stay late and enjoy herself. Because she was with Glen, she was obligated to remain as long as her fianc\u00e9 wanted.</p><p>Glen came looking for her, his smile gentle. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment to freshen up first, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said agreeably.</p><p>It seemed for a couple engaged to be married, neither of them revealed a high degree of enthusiasm. Glen looked tired. Jody knew he was working hard on a difficult case and put a lot of time and effort into his client\u2019s defense, but she strongly suspected his fatigue was something more than his workload.</p><p>The restroom was several doors down the hall. Jody walked past a number of offices and wondered how many other Christmas parties were going on in the building that night.</p><p>She\u2019d just stepped into a cubicle in the ladies\u2019 room when she heard two women.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure he\u2019s engaged?\u201d the first voice asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Lily took a good deal of delight in relaying the details to me.\u201d The second woman sounded shaken and very close to tears.</p><p>Jody bit down on her lower lip. Lily was an attorney who worked with Glen. Was it possible the two were referring to Glen and her? She wondered what she should do, or if she should say something.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Maryann, what did you expect Glen to do? You told him in no uncertain terms that you weren\u2019t interested in marriage.\u201d</p><p>Maryann. This was the woman Glen had mentioned, the one he\u2019d once loved. Jody squeezed her eyes closed and tried to remember the particulars of his and Maryann\u2019s romance. All she could recall was that Glen was convinced Maryann didn\u2019t love him. Breaking off the relationship had devastated him. It was this common ground of loss in which their own relationship had been rooted.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I assumed we could live together,\u201d Maryann told her friend. \u201cCouples do that these days, you know, test the waters to see if they\u2019re compatible. It seemed to be a reasonable thing to do in light of all the divorce cases I\u2019ve handled over the years. Oh, damn,\u201d she said, \u201cI hate it when I cry. Look what it\u2019s doing to my makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Maryann\u2019s voice faded and Jody assumed that was because she was studying her reflection in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to let him go ahead with the wedding, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I stop him?\u201d Maryann asked.</p><p>\u201cTell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>Maryann hesitated, and when she spoke Jody could hear her tears. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the truth is anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him you\u2019re in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that. Oh, Shelly, honestly, you\u2019re too much of a romantic to realize love doesn\u2019t automatically fix everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does if you\u2019re both willing to work at it,\u201d Maryann\u2019s friend insisted.</p><p>Afraid of eavesdropping any longer Jody walked out of the cubicle. It was then that the two women realized they weren\u2019t alone. Embarrassed, they both avoided looking in Jody\u2019s direction. Taking advantage of their surprise, Jody quietly slipped out of the restroom.</p><p>She returned to her office, walking past the merrymakers, needing some time alone to absorb what she\u2019d learned. Sitting at her desk, she closed her eyes and tried to reason out what she should do.</p><p>The answer should have been far less complex than she was making it. Her sense of fairness said she needed to break off the engagement and explain what she\u2019d heard to Glen. It was an ironic twist that in all the time she\u2019d worked in the building she would meet Maryann now and overhear the conversation she had.</p><p>Yet there was a part of her that yearned to give her son the father he longed for, the man who would gently guide him through life. Timmy enjoyed Glen\u2019s company so very much. Her son had never been happier than the last few weeks when she\u2019d been dating the attorney.</p><p>The real question was if Jody had it in her to grab hold of happiness, however limited, at the expense of another. Having placed the question in that frame, she knew instantly that she had no choice.</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw you,\u201d Glen said, stepping into the small office. \u201cWhat are you doing back here?\u201d</p><p>Jody looked up from her desk and blinked, surprised to see him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Glen asked. He was a gentle, sensitive man, Jody realized, and she was going to miss him dreadfully. But not nearly as much as Timmy would.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Jody said.</p><p>\u201cJody?\u201d His eyes held hers as he sat.</p><p>She stared down at her hand and the beautiful diamond. Before she could find an excuse, she slipped the ring from her finger. \u201cI should never have accepted this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She held the ring out to Glen, but he didn\u2019t take it.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t in love,\u201d Jody said and her chest tightened with regret. \u201cYou\u2019re a special man and you deserve a woman who will love and treasure you with all her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that woman,\u201d Glen insisted.</p><p>\u201cWe both know that isn\u2019t true. If there was anything special about me, it was the fact that I have a son. Timmy was the real attraction. He represents the family you\u2019ve always wanted. The son you long to have. I made a mistake too,\u201d she said, expelling her breath in a rush. \u201cI hurried matters and all but proposed to you myself, long before either of us was ready for a committed relationship. I\u2019m not exactly sure why I found it so urgent for us to marry so soon. Especially when I realized neither of us is anywhere near being ready.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not be hasty,\u201d Glen said, sounding very much like the attorney he was. \u201cWe can reason this out. There isn\u2019t anything that says we can\u2019t have a long engagement, get to know each other better. You\u2019re right, I am fond of Timmy, but don\u2019t discount what I feel toward you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a very good reason you shouldn\u2019t marry me,\u201d Jody whispered. \u201cI\u2019m deeply in love with another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJody, please, we\u2019ve talked about this before. You don\u2019t need to worry about that. I\u2019ll never try to take Jeff\u2019s place in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d she continued undaunted, \u201care deeply in love with another woman.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until she said the words that she realized the depth of truth in them.</p> <p>Glen didn\u2019t argue with her, and for that she was grateful. \u201cI\u2019d never be unfaithful to you,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re willing to do so with yourself.\u201d</p><p>Glen hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s over, Jody, and has been for months. There isn\u2019t any hope of reviving the relationship. It\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Jody smiled to herself and set the diamond ring on the desktop as she stood. \u201cIt may not be as dead as you think. I want you to wait here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo find someone. I shouldn\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Jody left him and hurried out the door. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure for which firm Maryann worked, but a quick inspection of the names on the outside of the doors on the floor helped. The receptionist directed her to Maryann\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Jody said, letting herself inside. \u201cI\u2019m Jody Potter.\u201d She waited to see if the other woman recognized the name. \u201cI was the one who overheard you speaking in the ladies\u2019 room a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Maryann paled when she recognized Jody\u2019s name. \u201cI had no idea you were there . . . we\u2019d never met and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I believe you. I\u2019m here because I have an important question to ask you. Are you in love with Glen Richardson?\u201d</p><p>The other woman folded her arms and looked out the window. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but this isn\u2019t any of your business. I understand you and Glen are engaged and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is my business now, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Jody interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI can imagine it was disconcerting for you to overhear my conversation with Shelly. It\u2019s just that . . . actually, I think it\u2019s best if I didn\u2019t say anything more.\u201d She drew in a steadying breath and then added graciously, \u201cI want you to know that I wish you and Glen every happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlen is a wonderful man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Maryann whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt complicates matters considerably knowing how deeply he loves you,\u201d Jody said.</p><p>Maryann\u2019s head snapped up, her eyes wide with surprise. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true, not after the things that happened between us. I was such a fool. There\u2019s no hope, not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure of that,\u201d Jody told her. \u201cGlen\u2019s free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re no longer engaged. He\u2019s waiting for you in my office now.\u201d</p><p>Jody had worked with attorneys for a number of years, but she rarely saw one speechless.</p><p>\u201cWhy . . . why are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>Jody didn\u2019t feel particularly noble. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced that kind of love myself, and for a while was willing to take second best. Go to him, Maryann, and settle whatever it was that drove you two apart. But most of all, love him. He deserves to be happy and so do you.\u201d</p><p>Tears shone bright in the attorney\u2019s eyes. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jody said, shrugging. \u201cAnytime.\u201d She turned and walked out then, past the sounds of the Christmas party and into the cold, dark night the same way she had every evening since Jeff\u2019s death.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>Michelle Madison was alone and frightened, and desperately trying to disguise her fear. Leah had spent a good deal of the afternoon with her and the young woman\u2019s labor was progressing smoothly.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d Michelle asked, following an intense contraction. Her hands rested against her protruding stomach and she drew in a deep, calming breath.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be much longer now,\u201d Leah assured her in gentle tones, although she was well aware it could be hours yet. She didn\u2019t want to discourage the young mother-to-be.</p><p>Michelle had come in earlier in the first stages of labor, before Leah had arrived for work. Because there was no one Michelle wanted to contact, she was alone. By the time Leah arrived for her shift, the labor had intensified and, frightened, Michelle had clung to Leah\u2019s hand, begging her to stay.</p><p>Since there weren\u2019t any other patients on the floor, Leah was able to linger at the young woman\u2019s bedside, guiding her step by step through the stages of labor and birth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased I\u2019m having my baby with you,\u201d Michelle offered just before the next pain overtook her. She closed her eyes and drew in deep, even breaths while Leah softly encouraged her to relax and accept the pain.</p><p>\u201cI was in the birthing class that visited the labor room when you were here.\u201d</p><p>Leah had thought the young woman looked vaguely familiar, but wasn\u2019t sure where she\u2019d seen her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to remember me,\u201d Michelle continued. \u201cLots of people were asking you questions that day. Jo Ann Rossini claimed anyone who was lucky enough to have their babies on your shift should consider themselves blessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you might have guessed, Jo Ann\u2019s a longtime friend,\u201d Leah said, discounting the compliment. She wasn\u2019t a miracle worker and although she was gentle with the mothers, they were the ones who did the work. It was called labor for a reason.</p><p>\u201cYou said you don\u2019t have children yourself,\u201d Michelle murmured, her eyes closed as the lingering pain gradually faded.</p><p>There\u2019d been a time when the careless comment would have felt like a body blow to Leah, but not now. A child nestled beneath her heart, nurtured by her body, one conceived in love.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Leah concurred. She carefully studied the fetal monitor, pleased that matters were progressing normally for Michelle.</p><p>\u201cYou want children, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much,\u201d Leah confirmed.</p><p>A smile, fragile and ever so slight, turned up the edges of Michelle\u2019s mouth. Leah guessed the girl was barely twenty, if that, but she didn\u2019t want to burden her with unnecessary questions.</p><p>Michelle massaged her belly and took in several calming breaths, bracing herself for the next pain. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to love this baby. I imagine that sounds odd to someone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Leah said, wanting to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cLonny didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with me after he found out I was pregnant. I believed he loved me, and in his own way, I\u2019m sure he did, but he wasn\u2019t ready for the responsibility of a wife and family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound bitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. At first I was. Not until later did I realize Lonny was right. Getting married now would have been wrong for us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very wise for your years.\u201d Leah greatly admired Michelle for looking past her pain and finding her peace. Women much older would have difficulty recognizing such deep truths.</p><p>\u201cFor a while I seriously considered getting an abortion. I never thought I was that kind of person. That\u2019s what my mother wanted and later when my dad found out, he did too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased now that I decided to go through with the pregnancy. It hasn\u2019t been easy, especially toward the end when I looked like a blimp. My parents have had a difficult time dealing with me having this baby. They said they loved me, but if I wanted to do this, then I\u2019d do it alone. That\u2019s why no one is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a strong woman, Michelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the right choice for me. What surprises me is how much I love this baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a good mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be the very best.\u201d</p><p>With this kind of attitude, Michelle had a chance, Leah decided. She stepped around to the end of the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s time we check you again.\u201d The last series of pains had gained in intensity and she suspected Michelle would soon be entering the third stage of labor.</p><p>Once the task was completed, Michelle relaxed. \u201cWill you be in the delivery room with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Leah said. \u201cNormally I\u2019d stay but I have a doctor\u2019s appointment this afternoon myself. Let\u2019s play this by ear and see how matters go. You\u2019re doing just great so I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Michelle, said faintly. \u201cI want you to be there if you can. I need someone.\u201d</p><p>To have Michelle so alone at this important moment tore at Leah\u2019s heart. She longed to reassure her patient that she\u2019d seen cases like hers often. \u201cYour parents will come around soon enough,\u201d Leah said, gently patting her hand. \u201cThey\u2019re going to love this baby. They won\u2019t be able to help themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any names picked out?\u201d</p><p>Michelle shook her sweat-dampened head. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t want to know if the baby was a girl or a boy. I thought I\u2019d decide on a name later.\u201d</p><p>Another two hours passed before Michelle was ready for the delivery room. Leah went in with her, along with the anesthesiologist, Dr. Leon, and the gynecologist, Dr. Beecher. Leah had worked with the anesthesiologist on numerous occasions.</p><p>Michelle was a model patient and when the moment came for her baby to be born, she gave a shout of joy. \u201cA girl, a girl.\u201d Leah weighed the squalling newborn, wrapped her in a warm blanket, and gently placed her in Michelle\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cA girl,\u201d Michelle sobbed. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased I had a little girl. That was what I wanted, but I was so afraid to care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful baby,\u201d Leah said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you for your help.\u201d</p><p>After she carried the newborn into the nursery, Leah happened to glance up at the clock. She\u2019d need to hurry if she was going to make it to Dr. Benoit\u2019s in time for her appointment. \u201cI have to rush now, but I\u2019ll be by to see you in the morning,\u201d she told Michelle when she returned.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t forget,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Leah promised. She started to leave, but Michelle grabbed hold of her hand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without you. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who worked so hard,\u201d Leah said, squeezing the young woman\u2019s hand. \u201cGive yourself some credit.\u201d</p><p>Michelle beamed her a bright smile. \u201cAll right, I will.\u201d She closed her eyes and yawned. \u201cI feel like I could sleep for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Bye for now.\u201d On her way out the door Leah realized Michelle was already asleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leah felt wonderful. Her workday had been full and rewarding. She hurried into the parking lot and started her car, driving past the nativity scene on the hospital side yard. A sense of expectancy filled her. The way she felt, she didn\u2019t need Dr. Benoit to confirm what she already knew. There wasn\u2019t a doubt in her mind what he would tell her.</p><p>The housekeeper had instructions to place a bottle of fine champagne on ice, and there were two thick steaks in the refrigerator. This evening she and Andrew would celebrate. She\u2019d call her parents and if possible wait until the following evening to let Andrew\u2019s mother know when they got together for Christmas Eve.</p><p>This would be the best Christmas ever, Leah was convinced of that.</p><p>Dr. Benoit was a kind, older physician with a quick wit and a gentle heart. He\u2019d been a comfort to her in those bleak years, reassuring and confident when Leah felt having a child was hopeless. It was only fitting that he be the one to tell her she was pregnant.</p> <p>\u201cLeah,\u201d he said, coming into the cubicle. His smile was warm and tender. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she said, holding onto his hand with both of hers. \u201cIt\u2019s happened. Andrew and I are pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, but then Leah gave him no opportunity.</p><p>\u201cKathy is thrilled for me.\u201d Kathy was the nurse who\u2019d collected the urine sample from her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down and talk,\u201d he said, directing her to the chair. \u201cLeah, you don\u2019t know how deeply this pains me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPains you?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a baby. How could such wonderful news pain you?\u201d</p><p>The doctor\u2019s eyes softened. He took her hand in his. \u201cLeah, the test is negative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be some mistake,\u201d she said, leaping to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything to tell you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m late and experienced all the symptoms,\u201d she argued. \u201cIt isn\u2019t possible for me not to be pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mind is very powerful. I don\u2019t believe science has a clue of its potential. When a woman wants a child as fervently as you do, she\u2019s sometimes able to convince her body she\u2019s pregnant. That\u2019s what I believe happened in your case.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t true. Leah refused to believe it, and yet she had no choice. Reaching for her purse, she walked toward the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, but she wasn\u2019t and she doubted that she ever would be again.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back early,\u201d Helen Chandler commented when Jody walked into the house after leaving the office party. She took off her coat and hung it in the hall closet.</p><p>\u201cJody, whatever is the matter?\u201d her mother pressed. \u201cYou look as if you\u2019ve been crying.\u201d Helen followed her into the kitchen where Jody poured herself a cup of coffee. She wasn\u2019t the least bit thirsty, but she needed something to hold onto while she steadied her nerves.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Timmy?\u201d she asked, surprised not to find her son in front of the television screen, battling it out with alien warlords.</p><p>\u201cIn his room,\u201d Helen answered with a slight frown. \u201cHe\u2019s wrapping his gift for you. He wouldn\u2019t even show me what it is. Now tell me what\u2019s wrong. I can\u2019t remember seeing you like this in a good long while. You\u2019re as pale as a ghost.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI broke off the engagement with Glen,\u201d Jody whispered, not wanting Timmy to hear. Not yet. She\u2019d tell her son as soon as she\u2019d composed herself and could do so without emotion. Her heart wasn\u2019t entangled with Glen\u2019s and yet she ached for all the might-have-beens.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d her mother asked, sinking into the chair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love Glen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d her mother cried. \u201cHow could you not love someone like Glen? He\u2019s perfect for you and Timmy. Why, that man walks on water. You couldn\u2019t ask for a better husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to argue with you, Mom. Everything you say is true, but it was more than not loving him. I know what it\u2019s like to be deeply in love, but when it came right down to it, I realized I couldn\u2019t accept second best.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s shoulders sagged with defeat. \u201cYou might have grown to feel that way about him. Jody, for the love of heaven, you\u2019ve got to let go of the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was one other minor complication with Glen,\u201d she said, holding the coffee mug tightly. \u201cHe\u2019s in love with someone else and I learned that she\u2019s still in love with him too.\u201d</p><p>Helen braced her elbows against the tabletop and hung her head. \u201cAnd so you did the noble thing and stepped aside. Oh, Jody, what am I going to do with you?\u201d</p><p>Jody laughed and impulsively squeezed her mother\u2019s arm. \u201cThis entire experience has been a valuable lesson to me. In my heart, I know I did the right thing. I just didn\u2019t expect it to hurt so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s lessons aren\u2019t cheap.\u201d</p><p>Jody nodded. \u201cEver since Jeff disappeared, I\u2019ve clung to the misty memories of our years together. The circumstances surrounding his death and all that followed caused me to build a cocoon around Timmy and me. I was so terribly frightened of being hurt again. Jeff was a good husband and I loved him more than I thought it was possible to love another human, but I\u2019ve built up those years in my mind into a picture of paradise.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s head came up. \u201cI\u2019ve waited a good long while for you to realize this. It sounds like you\u2019ve done some heavy-duty thinking these last few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Jody admitted, and a good deal of it had been enlightening. \u201cMore than anything I realize I\u2019ve clung to a half-filled glass, afraid to let go of that small bit of happiness I\u2019d found and reach for the quart jar that was sitting right in front of me.\u201d</p><p>Helen\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve lost me with all this talk of glasses and quart jars. I thought we were talking about you and Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to get back to my life now,\u201d Jody said pensively, \u201cready to reach out in faith and trust God for Timmy\u2019s and my future. I\u2019m going to squeeze every bit of joy I can out of what\u2019s left of my life. For the first time since Jeff\u2019s death I feel like I have one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to spend the rest of it alone, either. There\u2019s a man for me out there\u2014someone who\u2019ll be a good father to Timmy, and a good husband for me. A man who\u2019ll be a friend, a partner, and a lover.\u201d</p><p>Helen bit into her lower lip. \u201cI\u2019ve waited years for you to tell me this. I don\u2019t know what happened to open your eyes to the truth, but I\u2019m eternally grateful.\u201d She stood and hugged Jody. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to talk to Timmy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI love watching Timmy. He\u2019s a delight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor that, yes,\u201d Jody said with tears in her eyes. \u201cBut for everything else too, for being there when I needed you, for listening to me, and most of all for standing with me, loving me, giving me the emotional support I needed. You\u2019re the best mom in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were like this as a little girl,\u201d her mother said with a smile, \u201cbuttering me up before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Jody laughed and the two hugged.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Timmy said, standing in the doorway. \u201cWhy are you and Grandma crying?\u201d</p><p>They both started laughing then, which was sure to confuse him all the more.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Glen?\u201d Timmy wanted to know next.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Helen said, reaching for her coat and purse.</p><p>Timmy watched his grandmother leave. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on around here?\u201d</p><p>Jody smiled and patted the top of his head. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d His eyes grew round with concern, or perhaps guilt, Jody didn\u2019t know which.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she assured him, placing her hand on his shoulder and bringing him close to her side. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about anything you did, I need to tell you something important about Glen and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Timmy muttered dejectedly, leaning against the doorway in the bathroom as if his weight were too heavy to support, \u201care you sure we have to go to church? It isn\u2019t even Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this before,\u201d Jody said, adding the finishing touches to her makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve. After church we\u2019ll go to Grandma\u2019s house and open our gifts with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she have hot chocolate and goodies like she did last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she will. Is the car loaded?\u201d Jody asked.</p><p>\u201cI did that a long time ago. I wish you\u2019d hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have plenty of time.\u201d She knew what Timmy really wanted was for the minutes to go by fast so he could get to the gift-opening part of the evening. The Christmas Eve church service was just unnecessary nonsense as far as he was concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only take a little bit longer,\u201d Jody promised. \u201cDon\u2019t let me forget the cheese roll and the crackers. They\u2019re in the refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d</p><p>There was something in Timmy\u2019s voice that clued her in to the fact that there was a problem with the cheese roll.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, lowering the mascara brush and turning her head away from the mirror to study her son.</p><p>\u201cAbout the cheese roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Jody returned the brush to the holder and tightened the top. Setting the cosmetic bag aside, she faced her son.</p><p>\u201cI had a little party with my friends the day Grandma was watching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Jody prompted.</p><p>\u201cEveryone had something yummy to bring and you took almost all the gingerbread cookies and, besides, I like the cheese roll better than cookies anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words there isn\u2019t any left.\u201d</p><p>Timmy nodded and hung his head. \u201cI have the feeling this isn\u2019t going to be a very good Christmas anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Glen?\u201d</p><p>Timmy lifted one shoulder halfheartedly. \u201cI understand why you aren\u2019t going to marry him and everything. But I was kinda thinking maybe he wouldn\u2019t mind coming by and seeing me every once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait until after Christmas and ask, okay?\u201d The real attraction for Glen had always been Timmy and she sincerely hoped the attorney would maintain contact with her son.</p><p>The doorbell chimed.</p><p>\u201cWho could that be on Christmas Eve?\u201d Jody wondered out loud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see,\u201d Timmy said, running toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cTimmy,\u201d Jody called out after him. \u201cLet me answer that.\u201d</p><p>She was too late. Her son enthusiastically threw open the door as if he expected Santa Claus to be on the other side.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he was saying cheerfully by the time Jody reached the door.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Jody said automatically, then gasped as she recognized the man standing on the other side of the screen door. In that moment, she swore her heart stopped dead. She flattened her palm over it and the room started to sway. Staggering two steps, she reached for the door to keep herself from collapsing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimmy,\u201d she said on the tail end of a strangled sob, pulling her son protectively toward her. \u201cThis is your father.\u201d</p><p>Leah had shed so many tears over the last seven years that she discovered that her fountain was dry. A numb feeling attached itself to her as she walked toward her car. She was barren. There was no child to swell and stretch her womb. There never would be. And yet . . . and yet she couldn\u2019t make her heart believe what surely was the truth.</p><p>The joy she\u2019d felt these last two weeks, believing she was pregnant, was gone. All she could do was live day by day with the emptiness in her heart.</p> <p>Now she must tell Andrew.</p><p>Naturally they\u2019d both pretend it didn\u2019t matter, there was nothing else to do. They\u2019d reassure each other and go on, one day into the next, through Christmas, pretending. All the family would be celebrating and she\u2019d have no choice but to make believe all was well with her.</p><p>She drove home in a daze, parked her car in the driveway, and walked like a zombie into her house. She moved without direction or will, walking around the perfection of her home, stopping in front of their designer Christmas tree.</p><p>Her gaze rested on the beautifully wrapped gifts. Her one thought was to locate the Baby\u2019s First Christmas ornament she\u2019d purchased for Andrew, remove it before he unwrapped it on Christmas morning.</p><p>Her search became frantic as she sorted through the presents. They\u2019d both suffered enough.</p> <p>Suddenly she was blinded by tears and couldn\u2019t locate the gift, couldn\u2019t recall which package contained the ornament. She tossed one gaily wrapped present after another aside, her chest heaving with sobs.</p><p>Collecting herself, her hands shaking almost uncontrollably, she methodically sorted the packages into two piles. Hers and Andrew\u2019s. Then one by one she tore open his presents until she\u2019d located the silver ornament.</p><p>Taking it with her, she walked into the kitchen and threw it in the garbage. The champagne was on ice. She paused, picked it up, and with drops of water leaving a glistening trail across the floor, she carried that to the garbage as well.</p><p>The garage door sounded in the distance, signaling Andrew\u2019s return. His steps sounded eager as he approached the door leading to the house.</p><p>Leah was frozen, immobile.</p><p>Andrew walked into the kitchen and stopped when he saw her.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t need to say a word. He came to her and wrapped her in his arms.</p><p>Leah woke the following morning, her throat dry and chest heavy. Her eyes stung. Andrew rolled over and tucked his arm over her side, scooting closer, cuddling her spoon fashion.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to work today,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll stay home with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve. The hospital is already short-staffed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor once, think about yourself instead of that damned hospital.\u201d</p><p>The short fuse on his temper was the first indication he\u2019d given her of his own bitter disappointment. In some ways having him release his frustration freed Leah.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cCall in sick,\u201d he pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cI need to work. It\u2019ll help.\u201d As if there was anything capable of easing this constant ache. It continued day after day, dull and constant, a steady, ever-present reminder that she was less of a wife, less of a woman.</p><p>Despite Andrew\u2019s protests, she dressed in her uniform, and even managed to down a cup of coffee before she left the house. Andrew walked her out to her car, looking weary and burdened. His hands were buried in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you back at the house at four,\u201d he said. \u201cI told Mother we\u2019d be at her place around four-thirty.\u201d</p><p>She raised questioning eyes to her husband.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re spending the evening with her, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She\u2019d momentarily forgotten.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to cancel?\u201d Andrew asked, tenderly brushing the hair from her forehead.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint her.\u201d</p><p>Andrew nodded and hugged Leah. They clung to each other for a moment extra and then reluctantly separated.</p><p>Leah drove to the hospital and for reasons she didn\u2019t understand, she walked over to the side yard where the faded nativity scene was displayed.</p><p>The manger was empty. As empty as her heart. As empty as her arms. She hung her head and closed her eyes. If this was a battle, she was surrendering. A prayer sailed straight from her heart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why You don\u2019t want me to have a child,\u201d she whispered, \u201cbut I can\u2019t hold onto this pain any longer. It hurts too much. I can\u2019t trust even myself.\u201d She\u2019d given up trusting God years earlier, preferring to rely upon herself. Now that foundation had crumbled and she was left standing on the sharp rocks of her self-inflicted pain. In essence she was holding up a white flag to God, accepting whatever it was He had planned for her life. She was through fighting, through insisting she knew best, through being miserable.</p><p>Her prayer complete, she lifted her head. As she looked upward her gaze continued toward the faded yellow angel that adorned the rickety stable. Leah gasped as a breathless emotion clenched at her heart.</p><p>The angel was magnificent, golden and bright, her wings spanned out in elaborate display. She was so bright that Leah couldn\u2019t continue to look directly at her. She blinked, thinking this was some type of optical illusion. The sun bouncing off a mirror, or some such phenomenon. But when she opened her eyes, the angel was still there.</p><p>Glancing around, she wanted to point out this miracle to whomever she could find.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she cried out, spying an older woman walking along the sidewalk. Her head was bent against the wind. \u201cIt\u2019s an angel,\u201d Leah cried, attracting the other woman\u2019s attention.</p><p>The woman stopped and looked toward the nativity scene where Leah was standing.</p><p>\u201cThat angel\u2019s been there for years. Hospital ought to do something about replacing that old set. It\u2019s about to fall over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a real angel,\u201d Leah insisted, looking back, but when she did she realized God\u2019s messenger had vanished. Leah stared good and hard, wondering if God was attempting to tell her something. If so, the meaning was directed at her alone.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s real, then heaven\u2019s in sorrier shape than I realized,\u201d the woman said with a deep-throated chuckle.</p><p>Leah\u2019s heart felt as light as an angel\u2019s feather as she walked into the hospital. Since she was a few minutes early, she stopped in the nursery to take a look at the baby girl Michelle had delivered the day before.</p><p>The infant, wrapped in a soft pink blanket, was sound asleep. A small red Christmas bow was taped to the side of her crib. Leah rarely visited the nursery. It had been a painful experience in the past, longing for a child so hopelessly herself, but she experienced none of the sharp edges of regret this time. It was as if the burden on her soul had been lifted.</p><p>\u201cSo here you are,\u201d Bonnie said when Leah stepped out of the nursery. \u201cYour husband phoned, looking for you. He sounded anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d He rarely contacted her at the hospital.</p><p>\u201cI assumed you only had one husband,\u201d Bonnie teased. \u201cYou might want to call him yourself. From the sounds of it he\u2019s pacing the floor, waiting to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>Leah headed for the phone, but after four rings the answering machine kicked in. If it was that important, Andrew would call again soon.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. No more than ten minutes later, Leah was reading over the nurse\u2019s report at their station when Andrew came rushing down the corridor.</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d he called breathlessly. He wrapped his arms around her waist and lifted her off the ground. His eyes were bright and his voice sounded as if he were about to burst into peals of laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>He released her and his hands framed her face. \u201cI love you, Leah, never more than I do this moment.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, wondering at his craziness.</p><p>\u201cYou were right about us having a child. That feeling you claimed you had. It\u2019s happening, sweetheart, just the way you said it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Dr. Benoit said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Burchell phoned not more than two minutes after you left the house.\u201d</p><p>The name was vaguely familiar to Leah, but she couldn\u2019t remember from where.</p><p>\u201cThe lady from New Life Adoption Agency,\u201d he filled in. \u201cThey have a child for us. She\u2019ll be ready to leave the hospital first thing tomorrow morning. The mother\u2019s already signed the adoption papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we withdrew our names,\u201d Leah cried, covering her mouth, unwilling to believe it was true.</p><p>\u201cI asked that she reactivate our file weeks ago. We have a baby, Leah. A precious baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Monica was right, Chet realized. She\u2019d announced her decision to torment him and by heaven she\u2019d done it. He\u2019d close his eyes and he\u2019d be damned if she wasn\u2019t there like some ghost, pestering him until he ended up spending half the night dulling his mind with late-night television rather than attempt sleeping. The minute he tried, Monica was there, all sweet and soft, wrapping the tendrils of her love around his heart, reminding him of all he\u2019d rejected.</p><p>He\u2019d been trying to get hold of a moving company for the better part of the afternoon. Every one he called insisted on knowing his destination. That was the problem. They didn\u2019t have rates for \u201cany place that wasn\u2019t Seattle.\u201d</p><p>The bartender ambled over to where Chet was sitting. He was new, Chet noted, young and wet behind the ears. He\u2019d introduced himself as Billy. Appropriate enough since he looked more like a kid than an adult. If Chet were the one serving up the liquor he\u2019d have carded the youth.</p><p>\u201cYou want another cup of coffee?\u201d Billy asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Chet had given up on booze. The desired effect caused too many problems. True, he could drown his sorrows, as the saying went, but there was a heavy price to pay. Hangovers had never appealed to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of the new big-screen television?\u201d Billy asked. \u201cThe boss had it brought in this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Chet said, without looking. He wasn\u2019t interested in making conversation. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure why he\u2019d stopped in at the Blue Goose. It was a damn sight better than hanging around his place, he decided. Everything he\u2019d managed to accumulate in the last thirty-odd years was packed and ready to go. He just didn\u2019t know where he was headed yet.</p><p>The bar was deserted, Chet noticed, which was unusual this time of night. A couple was off in a dark corner and the two only had eyes for each other. Hands too, apparently. Other than the lovebirds and Billy, Chet was the only other customer. \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHome, I guess. It\u2019s Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d He\u2019d lost track of the days. In the back of his mind he knew Christmas was close, but it was a day like any other as far as he was concerned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect we\u2019ll get much of a crowd this evening. Places like this generally don\u2019t over the Christmas holidays,\u201d Billy commented as if this were something he\u2019d garnered in his vast experience tending bar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGuess not,\u201d Chet mumbled, unwilling to be drawn into a conversation, but he could tell from the way the kid was hanging around that he wasn\u2019t going to have much of a choice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think Lou would close up shop,\u201d Billy said next.</p><p>Chet sipped from his coffee. It was dark, thick, and potent enough to satisfy a Cajun.</p><p>\u201cApparently you don\u2019t know Lou,\u201d Chet commented.</p> <p>\u201cNot very well,\u201d Billy agreed.</p><p>Thinking he might divert the kid\u2019s attention, Chet swiveled around in his chair and concentrated on the television. The national evening news was on, forecasting gloom and doom. Chet had heard enough of that.</p><p>\u201cMind if I change the channel?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBe my guest,\u201d Billy said, handing him the controller.</p><p>Chet worked his way through the stations. Nothing appealed to him, not even a rerun of a play-off football game telecast earlier that week.</p> <p>\u201cHey, go back, would you?\u201d Billy asked. \u201cI have a friend who was picked up by the pros. He\u2019s a defensive lineman for the Redskins.\u201d</p><p>Disgusted, Chet handed the remote control back to the bartender. So much for that idea. Oblivious to Chet\u2019s ugly mood, Billy punched the controller until he found the play-off game.</p><p>The kid focused his attention on the screen, which suited Chet just fine as long as he left him alone.</p><p>Before he realized it, Chet had turned around on his bar stool and was watching the game himself. So this was what his life had boiled down to\u2014sitting in some bar on Christmas Eve, talking to a kid he didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t want to know and watching reruns of old football games on television.</p><p>At halftime Billy disappeared into the back storeroom. Chet cradled the coffee mug in his hands and studied the television screen. The commentator was the well-known former coach of the Los Angeles Raiders, John Madden.</p><p>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself, Chet Costello,\u201d the TV commentator said.</p> <p>Chet\u2019s head snapped up. He was losing it. The television was actually talking to him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m talking to you,\u201d John Madden said again. \u201cYou\u2019re the biggest fool I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>By that time Chet was on his feet. He stared down at his drink, thinking the kid had played a cruel joke on him and laced it with some mind-bending drug.</p><p>\u201cQuit looking at your drink,\u201d the former coach told him. \u201cIt\u2019s only coffee.\u201d</p><p>Other men claimed to see pink elephants, but not Chet. Oh, no, that would have been too easy. He had to have some voice come out of a television to chastise him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with Monica Fischer, and she\u2019s in love with you. So what\u2019s the problem? You think you\u2019re being noble, don\u2019t you? Wrong. You\u2019re a fool.\u201d</p><p>Chet had had enough. He didn\u2019t need this. Slamming his cup down on the bar, he started out the door.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and run,\u201d the voice said, sounding so close he swore he could feel the breath against the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019ve been doing for most of your life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Chet shouted.</p><p>The couple in the back of the room glared over at him, and Billy, who was hauling a box of pretzels to the front, stopped in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d the kid asked.</p><p>Chet shook his head and slammed out of the bar. \u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered, running his hand down his face. It was worse than he imagined. Monica had decided ruining his sleep wasn\u2019t bad enough, now she\u2019d taken on his waking hours as well.</p><p>He was putting an end to that right now. With purpose directing his steps, he walked to the parking garage and drove to her house.</p><p>The streets were full of parked cars. The Blue Goose might be less than busy, but Lloyd Fischer\u2019s church was doing a bumper business. Light spilled out of the church, and the parsonage was dark, all but one small light in the front of the house. Music filled the night, traditional Christmas carols played on an old-time pipe organ.</p><p>Chet found a place to park on the street, half a block down from the church. Several people were walking toward the building. There was a family with two small children in tow, and an older couple, holding hands, smiling up at each other.</p><p>Chet stayed where he was, hidden in the shadows. One thing he knew, he wasn\u2019t walking into that church. He was deciding what he was going to do when he spied Monica coming out of the parsonage. The porch light went on as the light in the living room was extinguished. Her silhouette was framed in the warm glow of the single bulb on the porch.</p><p>She seemed to be in something of a hurry, Chet noted. Rushing across the street, he met up with her on the sidewalk.</p><p>She stopped when she saw him. Surprise worked its way across her features, starting with her eyes and then her mouth. She opened it as if to say something, then closed it again. She hugged sheet music against her breast and seemed to be waiting.</p><p>Chet didn\u2019t know what he intended to say. It was too damn hard not to bring her directly into his arms, hold her against him, and breathe in her softness.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019ve done has got to stop,\u201d he said between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cDone?\u201d she echoed, and blinked as if she didn\u2019t understand what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She nodded once and waited, apparently for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat or sleep, and now I\u2019m hearing voices as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoices?\u201d The edges of her mouth quivered with amusement. \u201cAnd what did these voices say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was a fool for walking away from you.\u201d Chet rammed his fingers into his hair.</p><p>Monica smiled boldly at that and Chet swore he\u2019d never seen a woman more beautiful. He shouldn\u2019t have come, and now that he was here, God help him, he didn\u2019t know how he was ever going to leave.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could claim credit for that, but I can\u2019t,\u201d she said softly. \u201cDad told me he suspected you were drinking heavily. My guess is that it was the liquor talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d he argued. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a drop all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you, Chet,\u201d she said sadly and raised her fingers as if to touch his face. He meant to jerk away, but found he couldn\u2019t. As it never failed to do, her touch rippled through him like an electrical current. Her softness had branded his life and his heart. There was no escape. He could run to the far ends of the world and every breath he drew, every beat of his heart would be for her.</p><p>Capturing her wrist, he roughly drew her palm to his mouth where he planted a series of tender kisses.</p><p>\u201cDear God, Monica,\u201d he said, hauling her into his arms. He buried his face in the delicate curve of her neck and drew in several deep, uneven breaths. \u201cI can\u2019t make myself leave you. I tried. God knows I tried.\u201d</p><p>The sheet music she\u2019d been holding fell to the sidewalk as she clung to him. He felt her trembling, her tears moistening his face and her breath coming in soft gasps that fanned his throat.</p><p>He held her against him, his chin resting on the crown of her head. His eyes were tightly closed. \u201cWe\u2019ll get married, just the way you want, although I can\u2019t help but feel you\u2019re getting the bum end of this deal.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my real-life dad?\u201d Timmy asked, staring up at Jeff with wide, disbelieving eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, son, I\u2019m your father.\u201d Although Jeff answered Timmy, his gaze was leveled on Jody, his look expectant and filled with nervous anticipation.</p><p>Her pulse had yet to right itself, and the dizziness from the frantic beat of her heart continued. He was terribly thin, she noticed. His cheeks were hollow and his eyes seemed to sink back into his head. This was a man she didn\u2019t know and barely recognized as the one she\u2019d loved.</p><p>Jeff seemed greedy for the sight of Timmy and her, staring at the two of them as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe this moment was real.</p><p>Timmy opened the screen door and Jeff walked inside the house, pausing in front of Jody.</p><p>Her eyes begged him to convince her this was happening and that he was as real as he seemed. She\u2019d been under a good deal of stress and she feared that this was all a figment of her imagination. Some dream she\u2019d wake from with a start. When Jeff had first disappeared she\u2019d repeatedly dreamed of a moment like this when they\u2019d be reunited. Then she\u2019d wake with a heavy heart and the loneliness would close in and swallow her.</p><p>Her hand trembled as she worked up the necessary courage to touch him. She laid her fingers against his forearm. He felt solid and real. Warm and alive.</p><p>Alive. Jeff was alive.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d she asked in a sobbing breath, pressing her hands to her throat. \u201cWhy did you leave us? Why?\u201d The questions crowded on top of each other, damming her mind and her tongue. The only one to escape was the least important.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I sit down?\u201d he asked, and Jody realized how terribly shaky he was. \u201cI\u2019m a bit weak yet,\u201d Jeff explained.</p><p>It was all Jody could do to nod.</p><p>Timmy took Jeff by the hand and led him to the sofa. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like my dad,\u201d he commented, carefully studying his father. \u201cYou\u2019re too old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m about a hundred,\u201d Jeff said, examining his son. He cupped Timmy\u2019s face and his eyes filled with tears. \u201cNot a day passed that I didn\u2019t think about and pray for you. I carried the picture of you with me through the months. I swear it was what kept me alive. I could endure anything as long as I remembered my wife and my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Timmy asked, sinking onto the cushion next to his father.</p><p>Trembling almost uncontrollably, Jody sat in the chair across from them both, her legs too numb to continue to support her.</p><p>\u201cI was in a Russian prison,\u201d Jeff explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle I was released.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in Russia?\u201d Jody repeated in a breathless whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d gone to Germany on business and on a fluke decided to visit East Berlin. I was curious about the other side of the wall, but doubted that I\u2019d be able to make it through the border with an American passport. It was surprisingly easy to obtain fake identification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went through all that trouble because you were curious about East Berlin?\u201d Jody found the entire story unbelievable and a fermenting kind of anger took hold of her. He\u2019d risked everything for some crazy need to look at life on the other side of the wall?</p><p>\u201cI was young and stupid, so incredibly stupid,\u201d Jeff said, the regret weighing down his voice. \u201cMy German was passable, and all I intended to do was wander into a few shops and get a look around. I was heading back to the border when I stumbled upon two soldiers beating a teenager. They would have killed him. I couldn\u2019t stand by and do nothing and so I intervened. That proved to be a costly mistake.\u201d</p><p>Jody\u2019s anger dissipated. He\u2019d paid a terrible price for his curiosity, and consequently so had she and Timmy.</p><p>\u201cI was taken in for questioning and soon arrested,\u201d Jeff continued.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you contact the embassy?\u201d Jody demanded. He could have saved them both this agony.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed. And when they discovered I was an American with a false passport my fate was sealed. I was a spy, and tried as one. I wasn\u2019t able to talk to an attorney, and the trial, such as it was, lasted all of two minutes. Before I fully understood what was happening to me, I was shipped off to a prison camp in Russia.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jody covered her mouth with both hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been held there ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did you escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Jeff explained. \u201cI was freed. They dropped me off on a German street as if nothing had happened. The last two weeks I\u2019ve been hospitalized and debriefed. From what I\u2019ve been able to grasp this all has something to do with the breakup of the Soviet Union. There was a British man with an experience similar to mine who was released about the same time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I contacted right away?\u201d Jody demanded.</p><p>\u201cIn the beginning I was too ill. Apparently the authorities communicated with my mother first. I learned that you\u2019d divorced me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to do that for financial reasons,\u201d Jody told him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>A weak smile lit up his face.</p><p>\u201cIf you were well enough to travel, surely you could have made a phone call?\u201d Jody wasn\u2019t satisfied, not yet.</p> <p>\u201cAll I knew was that the woman I\u2019d loved had divorced me. I talked to my mother only once and she insisted I get home right away because you were about to marry another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Timmy told him. \u201cThey\u2019re only friends.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Jeff looked greatly relieved. \u201cThe doctors wanted to keep me longer, but I couldn\u2019t wait another minute. I had to reach you and talk to you face to face before it was too late.</p><p>\u201cIf getting out of Russia was miraculous, then finding an empty seat on a transatlantic flight was an even greater phenomenon. I was flying standby when some lady came running off the plane, claiming she was hearing voices over the headset that told her she shouldn\u2019t be on this flight. The funny thing was, she insisted it was Jay Leno, speaking directly to her. Whatever her reason, I got her seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were dead. My father took your dental records with him to Germany and your remains were positively identified. We buried you. This isn\u2019t possible, it just isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, Jody. I don\u2019t know why your father would do such a thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Daddy,\u201d Jody whispered and briefly closed her eyes. \u201cIt was three years after you\u2019d disappeared and I refused to give up hope. My life was in limbo. For financial reasons I\u2019d had to divorce you. Your mother didn\u2019t understand and I felt so incredibly guilty. Dad must have assumed that if we buried a body, I\u2019d be able to put the past behind me and get on with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father has a lot of explaining to do,\u201d Jeff said without rancor.</p><p>\u201cHe died a little more than a year ago. Unexpectedly. I\u2019d like to believe that if he\u2019d known he only had a short time to live, he\u2019d have told me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he would.\u201d</p><p>Jeff was more generous than he need be.</p><p>\u201cYour mother was telling me the truth,\u201d Jody whispered, remembering the calls she\u2019d received from Gloria Potter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you for not believing her. I was terribly ill and hadn\u2019t spoken to her myself. I want you to know that I love you, Jody. I\u2019ve always loved you and Timmy. It was the memory of the two of you that got me through this hellish nightmare. I also realize a lot of things can change in eight years, and I won\u2019t stand in the way of your happiness. All I ask is that you allow me to have contact with my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jeff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom and Glen aren\u2019t engaged anymore,\u201d Timmy explained excitedly. \u201cHe was in love with someone else and Mom\u2019s still in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s eyes slowly sought out hers as if he were afraid to trust what he was hearing. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI never stopped, not for an instant. I couldn\u2019t breathe and not love you.\u201d</p><p>Jeff held out his arms to her, Jody flew off the chair and inside a heartbeat was at his side. Jeff wrapped both Timmy and her in his embrace.</p><p>Tears rained down Jody\u2019s cheeks as she spread soft kisses over Jeff\u2019s face. The three of them were laughing and crying all at once.</p><p>\u201cGod answered my letter,\u201d Timmy said excitedly. \u201cHe gave me back my very own dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby girl,\u201d Leah repeated, afraid there\u2019d been some misunderstanding. \u201cWe should have been contacted by the adoption agency before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently the mother only made her decision yesterday afternoon. The crazy part is our daughter\u2019s right here in this very hospital. She\u2019s here, Leah. Here. Mrs. Burchell said she was born yesterday afternoon at Providence Hospital.\u201d</p><p>According to the records Leah had been reading when Andrew arrived, there\u2019d only been one girl delivered on December twenty-third and that had been the birth she\u2019d assisted. Michelle Madison\u2019s baby.</p><p>\u201cMichelle,\u201d she whispered, closing her eyes. The frightened young woman who was so alone and had clung to Leah. The one Leah had spent her entire shift coaching through labor and birth.</p><p>\u201cAndrew,\u201d she said, laughing and crying both at the same time. She took her husband by the hand. \u201cCome, I\u2019d like to introduce you to our daughter.\u201d Trembling, she led her husband toward the nursery. She had him remove his jacket and put on a sterile blue gown and set him in the rocking chair. Then with her heart so full it felt as though it would burst wide open, she gently lifted the sleeping infant from her crib and tenderly placed her in Andrew\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so tiny,\u201d her husband whispered, looking down on the plump pink face of their daughter.</p><p>\u201cAt eight pounds six ounces, her birth mother didn\u2019t think so,\u201d Leah said, smiling through her tears. \u201cYou two get acquainted and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>A look of panic came over Andrew. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo talk to someone very special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she cries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the nurses will help you, but don\u2019t look so worried. Everything will be all right.\u201d Including the rest of Leah\u2019s life.</p><p>Michelle was sitting up in bed when Leah came into the room. When she saw it was Leah, the young woman smiled and held out her hand, which Leah gripped. \u201cHave you heard from the adoption agency yet?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>Leah nodded. \u201cMy husband just told me.\u201d Now that she was here, Leah\u2019s heart was so full that she didn\u2019t know if it was possible to find the words to thank Michelle.</p><p>\u201cWhen I decided against the abortion, I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do,\u201d Michelle started. \u201cA friend suggested adoption and so I contacted New Life Adoption Agency. Their counselors were great, they didn\u2019t pressure me one way or the other. I met with them several times and they listened. You see, I assumed that in order to give up my baby, I had to keep myself from loving her, and I couldn\u2019t seem to make myself do that. In the beginning when Lonny left me, all the baby represented to me was heartache, and later as she started to grow and move, I discovered how very attached I was getting. I couldn\u2019t help being curious about adoptive parents, though, and for the first time, just a few weeks ago, I read over several profiles. Your letter stood out in my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Leah wanted to know. The letter had been written years earlier, and she couldn\u2019t remember any of what she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cYou wrote about being a delivery-room nurse and how you felt about helping young women through labor and birth. It seemed to me you must be someone very special. Then by some kind of fluke the birthing class I was attending toured Providence Hospital and we met you. Naturally I didn\u2019t know your last name, but I remembered what you\u2019d written. When I asked Jo Ann about you she told me you didn\u2019t have any children yourself, I figured you must be the Leah whose letter I\u2019d read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was why you chose to have your baby here at Providence Hospital?\u201d Leah asked.</p><p>Michelle nodded. \u201cIt was pure chance that you could be with me. I still hadn\u2019t decided if I could give my baby up for adoption. Then yesterday after she was born, you said something that helped me make up my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said something to help you decide?\u201d Leah was incredulous.</p><p>Michelle nodded. \u201cYou told me I would be a good mother to my baby. I\u2019m not giving her up because I don\u2019t love her. It\u2019s because I love her so very much that I can.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Burchell explained that you\u2019d had one birth mother change her mind at the last minute. You needn\u2019t worry, that won\u2019t happen this time. I feel very strongly that God led me to you and your husband and you\u2019re exactly the right couple for my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I thank you?\u201d Leah whispered through her tears.</p><p>\u201cBy loving her, guiding her through the years for me. When she\u2019s older and has questions about me, tell her how God brought the two of us together, tell her that He handpicked her family for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Leah promised, rubbing the moisture from her cheek.</p><p>The two women hugged and after she\u2019d dried her eyes Leah returned to the nursery. Andrew was gently rocking back and forth staring down at the face of his newborn daughter. One tiny fist was clenched around his index finger. The newborn was holding onto her daddy\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like the two of you are getting along nicely,\u201d Leah commented.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe she\u2019s really our daughter,\u201d Andrew said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a single doubt she belongs to us,\u201d Leah assured him.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided on a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Leah said, her response automatic. \u201cAngel.\u201d Some day she\u2019d tell her husband and her daughter about seeing the special Christmas angel, but not now. The angel had been His sign to her, His confirmation. She would carry that very special gift with her through the years.</p><p>\u201cAngel?\u201d Andrew repeated slowly, glancing up. \u201cBut I thought you had three names already chosen and I don\u2019t recall any of them being Angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems fitting to me. Do you object?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel Lundberg,\u201d he said again as if testing it on his tongue. \u201cIt feels right. Angel Hannah Lundberg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn to hold her,\u201d Leah said.</p><p>Andrew stood and gently placed the sleeping baby in Leah\u2019s arms. Angel arched her back and stretched, yawning before she nestled comfortably in Leah\u2019s arms as if this were exactly where she was supposed to be. With that Angel Lundberg immediately returned to sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re willing to marry me?\u201d Monica asked, unsure if she should trust what Chet was saying. \u201cBut why now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll regret letting you go the rest of my life. I love you, Monica. I heard a voice telling me what a fool I was and if it wasn\u2019t the booze speaking, then . . . hell, I didn\u2019t think anyone up there cared about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Chet Costello. I can\u2019t explain that voice, but whoever or whatever it was, I\u2019m thanking God.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and gently kissed her. \u201cNext thing I know we\u2019ll have a couple of kids and I\u2019ll be a regular churchgoer.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like heaven to Monica. \u201cWould you kindly shut up and kiss me again?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled her to him as if she were the most precious thing he would ever touch, as if he cherished every moment spent with her.</p><p>Monica inched her mouth from his and stared up into his face. His eyes met hers and it seemed they were filled with a thousand regrets.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou must.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop.\u201d She pressed her finger over his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to know everything there is about the Bible and God, but I do know that He said He would forgive us when we ask. If it\u2019s peace of mind you\u2019re seeking, it\u2019s available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pressed her hand over his heart. \u201cYou won\u2019t find what you\u2019re seeking in any building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed a man,\u201d Chet reminded her. \u201cHe murdered my partner and attempted to kill me. That\u2019s a little more serious than jaywalking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s ever done something he wishes he hadn\u2019t? You say this man you murdered attempted to kill you first. What you don\u2019t seem to realize is that in some ways he succeeded. He\u2019s reached out from the grave and gotten a stranglehold on your heart and your life.\u201d Monica saw Chet as a man whose life had been shredded to ribbons with the ax of revenge and regret. \u201cYour time of hate is over. You can stop punishing yourself now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy time of love is about to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said, winding her fingers into the hair at the base of his neck. \u201cNow, what was it you were saying about the two of us getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon, Monica, I\u2019m not going to be able to wait for you much longer.\u201d</p><p>She could feel the heat coming into her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to wait for you much longer either. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a woman more eager to give up her virginity than I am.\u201d</p><p>They kissed and the heat of their love and need was like a spontaneous combustion. Monica didn\u2019t know what would have happened if her father hadn\u2019t happened upon them just then.</p><p>It was the sound of Lloyd clearing his throat that broke them apart. \u201cDad,\u201d Monica said breathlessly. \u201cOh, Dad, you\u2019ll never guess what\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReverend Fischer,\u201d Chet said, taking charge. He looped his arm around Monica\u2019s waist and held out his free hand to her father to shake.</p><p>\u201cI take it congratulations are in order?\u201d the reverend asked.</p><p>Chet nodded. \u201cIf you don\u2019t object, I\u2019d like to marry your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObject,\u201d her father said, laughing. He slapped Chet across the back. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled for you both. You don\u2019t mind if I announce it at this evening\u2019s service, do you?\u201d</p><p>Chet looked at Monica, then back at her father. \u201cI\u2019d be more than pleased.\u201d</p><p>Together the three of them walked toward the church where the music swelled and teased the golden silence of the night with its lyrical melody.</p><p>Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy stood in the choir loft looking down on the congregation that had crowded into the church for Christmas Eve services.</p><p>\u201cYou should all be pleased with your efforts,\u201d Gabriel announced from behind them in a voice as light as yesterday\u2019s dreams.</p> <p>The three prayer ambassadors whirled around. Gabriel hadn\u2019t meant to surprise them, but he was well pleased with their accomplishments. His trips to earth were few and far between, but this was a special night, one created for exceptions.</p><p>\u201cTimmy has his father for Christmas,\u201d Shirley said proudly, \u201cthanks to a bit of manipulation with the airlines and a certain passenger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about that,\u201d Gabriel said sternly. Shirley was new to prayer assignments, and had much to learn. He noticed she\u2019d picked up a number of bad habits from her friends.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to Jeff and his family?\u201d</p><p>The future could be read by only a chosen few. Gabriel was pleased to offer a view to his young charges. \u201cJeff and Jody will go on to have another child, but not for two years. They\u2019ll have a little girl. As you can imagine they have a fair amount of readjusting to do first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Timmy?\u201d Shirley pressed. \u201cHe seems to be a very special young boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. Timmy Potter will grow up to become a top-notch pitcher with his goals set on the major leagues. He has a strong faith that will sustain him all his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Monica and Chet?\u201d Goodness wanted to know next, her eyes eager for a look into the future.</p><p>Gabriel was tempted to comment about this last bit of trouble Goodness had gotten herself into with the television screen. He decided against it, however. Goodness\u2019s methods had been unorthodox, but had worked wonderfully well. Chet had gone directly from the Blue Goose to Monica.</p><p>\u201cNow, there\u2019s an interesting couple,\u201d Gabriel said, studying the pair who sat in a pew in the front of the church, holding hands. \u201cChet will go back into police work. It\u2019s what suits him best and he\u2019s good at it. Monica will present him with four daughters and all four will be holy terrors. Their lives together are going to take a fair amount of adjustment as well. They\u2019re both strong-willed people, but their love for each other is much stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah and Andrew were able to bring Angel home this evening,\u201d Mercy told him, although Gabriel was well aware the couple\u2019s daughter was doing so well she was able to leave the hospital early.</p><p>\u201cYou might be surprised with what the future holds for them,\u201d Gabriel said. He wasn\u2019t overly pleased with Mercy\u2019s appearance atop the nativity scene, but at least this time she wasn\u2019t racing forklifts along a pier and frightening night watchmen out of ten years of their lives.</p><p>\u201cAre they able to adopt another child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but three earth years from now Leah will become pregnant with identical twin boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwins,\u201d Mercy echoed with delight. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you three,\u201d Gabriel felt obligated to comment. Their success had delighted him. \u201cYou worked well together.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Surely goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of your life,\u2019 \u201d Goodness quoted the well-known Bible verse. \u201cWe make a great team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we do it again?\u201d Shirley asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Mercy insisted. \u201cWe help each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should all visit Los Angeles next,\u201d was Goodness\u2019s suggestion. \u201cIt seems to me that the City of Angels could do with our help.\u201d</p><p>The three looked expectantly toward Gabriel. \u201cI\u2019m not making any promises,\u201d he said, and with a sweep of his wings ushered the three ambassadors into the celestial realm of heaven where the Christmas celebration was just about to begin. All of heaven was awaiting their return. </p> </body></html>"]
