It looked normal\u2014windowless walls painted black, rows of glass bottles, the smell of beer and stale air. But it wasn\u2019t normal, standing on the edge of Shiftertown as it did.</p> <p>\u201cYou the lawyer?\u201d a man washing glasses asked. He was human, not Shifter. No strange, slitted pupils, no Collar to control his aggression, no air of menace. Well, relatively no air of menace. This was a crappy part of town, and menace was its stock-in-trade.</p><p>Kim told herself she had nothing to be afraid of. They\u2019re tamed. Collared. They can\u2019t hurt you.</p><p>When she nodded, the man gestured with his cloth to a door at the end of the bar. \u201cKnock him dead, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to keep him alive.\u201d Kim pivoted and stalked away on her four-inch heels, feeling his gaze on her back all the way.</p><p>She knocked on the door marked \u201cPrivate,\u201d and a man on the other side growled, \u201cCome.\u201d</p> <p>I just need to talk to him. Then I\u2019m done, on my way home. A trickle of moisture rolled between Kim\u2019s shoulder blades as she made herself open the door and walk inside.</p><p>A man leaned back in a chair behind a messy desk, a sheaf of papers in his hands. His booted feet were propped on the desk, his long legs a feast of blue jeans over muscle. He was a Shifter all right\u2014thin black and silver Collar against his throat; hard, honed body; midnight black hair; definite air of menace. When Kim entered, he stood, setting the papers aside.</p><p>Damn. He rose to a height of well over six feet and gazed at Kim with eyes blue like the morning sky. His body wasn\u2019t only honed; it was hot\u2014big chest, wide shoulders, tight abs, firm biceps against a form-fitting black T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cKim Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>With old-fashioned courtesy, he placed a chair in front of the desk and motioned her to it. Kim felt the heat of his hand near the small of her back as she seated herself, smelled the scent of soap and male musk.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re Mr. Morrissey?\u201d</p><p>The Shifter sat back down, returned his motorcycle boots to the top of the desk, and laced his hands behind his head. \u201cCall me Liam.\u201d</p><p>The lilt in his voice was unmistakable. Kim put that with his black hair, impossibly blue eyes, and exotic name. \u201cYou\u2019re Irish.\u201d</p><p>He smiled a smile that could melt a woman at ten paces. \u201cAnd who else would be running a pub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t own it.\u201d</p><p>Kim could have bitten out her tongue as soon as she said it. Of course he didn\u2019t own it. He was a Shifter.</p><p>His voice went frosty, the crinkles at the corners of his eyes smoothing out. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you much on the Brian Smith case. I don\u2019t know Brian well, and I don\u2019t know anything about what happened the night his girlfriend was murdered. It\u2019s a long time ago, now.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment bit her, but Kim had learned not to let discouragement stop her when she needed to get a job done. \u201cBrian called you the \u2018go-to\u2019 guy. As in, when Shifters are in trouble, Liam Morrissey helps them out.\u201d</p> <p>Liam shrugged, muscles moving the bar\u2019s logo on his T-shirt. \u201cTrue. But Brian never came to me. He got into his troubles all by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. I\u2019m trying to get him out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes narrowed, pupils flicking to slits as he retreated to the predator within him. Shifters liked to do that when assessing a situation, Brian had told her. Guess who was the prey?</p><p>Brian had done the predator-prey thing with Kim at first. He\u2019d stopped when he began to trust her, but Kim didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever get used to it. Brian was her first Shifter client, the first Shifter, in fact, she\u2019d ever seen outside a television news story. Twenty years Shifters had been acknowledged to exist, but Kim had never met one.</p><p>It was well known that they lived in their enclave on the east side of Austin, near the old airport, but she\u2019d never gone over to check them out. Some human women did, strolling the streets just outside Shiftertown, hoping for glimpses\u2014and more\u2014of the Shifter men who were reputed to be strong, gorgeous, and well endowed. Kim had once heard two women in a restaurant murmuring about their encounter with a Shifter male the night before. The phrase \u201cOh, my God,\u201d had been used repeatedly. Kim was as curious about them as anyone else, but she\u2019d never summoned the courage to go near Shiftertown herself.</p><p>Then suddenly she had been assigned the case of the Shifter accused of murdering his human girlfriend ten months ago. This was the first time in twenty years Shifters had caused trouble, the first time one had been put on trial. The public, outraged by the killing, wanted Shifters punished, pointed fingers at those who\u2019d claimed the Shifters were tamed.</p><p>However, after Kim had met Brian, she\u2019d determined that she wouldn\u2019t do a token defense. She believed in his innocence, and she wanted to win. There wasn\u2019t much case law on Shifters because there\u2019d never been any trials, at least none on record. This was to be a well-publicized trial, Kim\u2019s opportunity to make a mark, to set precedent.</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes stayed on her, pupils still slitted. \u201cYou\u2019re a brave one, aren\u2019t you? To defend a Shifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave, that\u2019s me.\u201d Kim crossed her legs, pretending to relax. They picked up on your nervousness, people said. They know when you\u2019re scared, and they use your fear. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you, this case has been a pain in the ass from the get-go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans think anything involving Shifters is a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Kim shook her head. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s been a pain in the ass because of the way it\u2019s been handled. The cops nearly had Brian signing a confession before I could get to the interrogation. At least I put a stop to that, but I couldn\u2019t get bail for him, and I\u2019ve been blocked by the prosecutors right and left every time I want to review the evidence. Talking to you is a long shot, but I\u2019m getting desperate. So if you don\u2019t want to see a Shifter go down for this crime, Mr. Morrissey, a little cooperation would be appreciated.\u201d</p><p>The way he pinned her with his eyes, never blinking, made her want to fold in on herself. Or run. That was what prey did\u2014ran. And then predators chased them, cornered them.</p><p>What did this man do when he cornered his prey? He wore the Collar; he could do nothing. Right?</p><p>Kim imagined herself against a wall, his hands on either side of her, his hard body hemming her in...Heat curled down her spine.</p><p>Liam took his feet down and leaned forward, arms on the desk. \u201cI haven\u2019t said I won\u2019t help you, lass.\u201d His gaze flicked to her blouse, whose buttons had slipped out of their top holes during her journey through Austin traffic and July heat. \u201cIs Brian happy with you defending him? You like Shifters that much?\u201d</p><p>Kim resisted reaching for the buttons. She could almost feel his fingers on them, undoing each one, and her heart beat faster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with who I like. I was assigned to him, but I happen to think Brian\u2019s innocent. He shouldn\u2019t go down for something he didn\u2019t do.\u201d Kim liked her anger, because it covered up how edgy this man made her. \u201cBesides, Brian\u2019s the only Shifter I\u2019ve ever met, so I don\u2019t know whether I like them, do I?\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled again. His eyes returned to normal, and now he looked like any other gorgeous, hard-bodied, blue-eyed Irishman. \u201cYou, love, are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeisty. Yeah, I\u2019ve heard that one. Also spitfire, little go-getter, and a host of other condescending terms. But let me tell you, Mr. Morrissey, I\u2019m a damn good lawyer. Brian\u2019s not guilty, and I\u2019m going to save his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say unusual. For a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m willing to believe he\u2019s innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you came here, to the outskirts of Shiftertown, to see me. Alone.\u201d</p><p>The predator was back.</p><p>Why was it that when Brian looked at her like this, it didn\u2019t worry her? Brian was in jail, angry, accused of heinous crimes. A killer, according to the police. But Brian\u2019s stare didn\u2019t send shivers down her spine like Liam Morrissey\u2019s did.</p><p>\u201cAny reason I shouldn\u2019t have come alone?\u201d she asked, keeping her voice light. \u201cI\u2019m trying to prove that Shifters in general, and my client in particular, can\u2019t harm humans. I\u2019d do a poor job of it if I was afraid to come and talk to his friends.\u201d</p><p>Liam wanted to laugh at the little\u2014spitfire\u2014but he kept his stare cool. She had no idea what she was walking into; Fergus, the clan leader, expected Liam to make sure it stayed that way.</p><p>Damn it all, Liam wasn\u2019t supposed to like her. He\u2019d expected the usual human woman, sticks-up-their-asses, all of them, but there was something different about Kim Fraser. It wasn\u2019t just that she was small and compact, while Shifter women were tall and willowy. He liked the way her dark blue eyes regarded him without fear, liked the riot of black curls that beckoned his fingers. She\u2019d had the sense to leave her hair alone, not force it into some unnatural shape.</p><p>On the other hand, she tried to hide her sweetly curvaceous body under a stiff gray business suit, although her body had other ideas. Her br**sts wanted to burst out of the button-up blouse, and the stiletto heels only enhanced wickedly sexy legs.</p><p>No Shifter woman would dress as she did. Shifter women wore loose clothes they could quickly shed if they needed to change forms. Shorts and T-shirts were popular. So were gypsy skirts and sarongs in the summer.</p><p>Liam imagined this lady in a sarong. Her melon-firm br**sts would fill out the top, and the skirt would bare her smooth thighs.</p><p>She\u2019d be even prettier in a bikini, lolling around some rich man\u2019s pool, sipping a complicated drink. She was a lawyer\u2014there was probably a boss in her firm who had already made her his. Or perhaps she was using said boss to climb the success ladder. Humans did that all the time. Either the bastard would break her heart, or she\u2019d walk away happy with what she\u2019d got out of it.</p><p>That\u2019s why we stay the hell away from humans. Brian Smith had taken up with a human woman, and look where he was now.</p><p>So why did this female raise Liam\u2019s protective instincts? Why did she make him want to move closer, inside the radius of her body heat? She wouldn\u2019t like that; humans tried to stay a few feet apart from each other unless they couldn\u2019t help it. Even lovers might do nothing more than hold hands in public.</p><p>Liam had no business thinking about passion and this woman in the same heartbeat. Fergus\u2019s instructions had been to listen to Kim, sway her, then send her home. Not that Liam was in the habit of blindly obeying Fergus.</p><p>\u201cSo why do you want to help him, love?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re only defending him because you drew the short straw, am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the junior in the firm, so it was handed to me, yes. But the prosecutor\u2019s office and the police have done a shitty job with this case. Rights violations all over the place, but the courts won\u2019t dismiss it, no matter how much I argue. Everyone wants a Shifter to go down, innocent or guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you believe Brian didn\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d Kim tapped her throat. \u201cBecause of these.\u201d</p><p>Liam resisted touching the strand of black and silver metal fused to his own neck, a small Celtic knot at the base of his throat. The Collars contained tiny programmed chips enhanced by powerful Fae magic to keep Shifters in check, though the humans didn\u2019t want to acknowledge the magic part. The Collar shot an electric charge into a Shifter when his violent tendencies rose to the surface. If the Shifter persisted, the next dose was one of debilitating pain. A Shifter couldn\u2019t attack anyone if he was rolling around on the ground, writhing in agony.</p><p>Liam wasn\u2019t sure entirely how the Collars worked; he only knew that each became bonded to its wearer\u2019s skin and adapted to their animal form when they shifted. All Shifters living in human communities were required to wear Collars, which were irremovable once put on. Refusing the Collar meant execution. If the Shifter tried to escape, he or she was hunted down and killed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know Brian couldn\u2019t have committed a violent crime,\u201d Kim was saying. \u201cHis Collar would have stopped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. Your police claim the Collar malfunctioned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. When I suggest having it tested, I\u2019m greeted with all kinds of reasons it can\u2019t be. The Collar can\u2019t be removed, and anyway it would be too dangerous to have Brian Collarless if he could be. Also too dangerous to provoke him to violence and see if the Collar stops him. Brian\u2019s been calm since he was brought in. Like he\u2019s given up.\u201d She looked glum. \u201cI hate to see someone give up like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like the underdog?\u201d</p> <p>She grinned at him with red lips. \u201cYou could say that, Mr. Morrissey. Me and the underdog go back a long way.\u201d</p><p>Liam liked her mouth. He liked imagining it on his body, on certain parts of his anatomy in particular. He had no business thinking that, but the thoughts triggered a physical reaction below the belt.</p><p>Weird. He\u2019d never even considered having sex with a human before. He didn\u2019t find human women attractive; Liam preferred to be in his big cat form for sex. He found sex that way much more satisfying. With Kim, he\u2019d have to remain human.</p><p>His gaze strayed to her unbuttoned collar. Of course, it might not be so bad to be human with her...</p><p>What the hell am I thinking? Fergus\u2019s instructions had been clear, and Liam agreeing to them had been the only way Fergus had allowed Kim to come to Shiftertown at all. Fergus wasn\u2019t keen on a human woman being in charge of Brian\u2019s case, not that they had any choice. Fergus had been pissed about Brian\u2019s arrest from the beginning and thought the Shifters should back off and stay out of it. Almost as though he believed Brian was guilty.</p> <p>But Fergus lived down on the other side of San Antonio, and what he didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt him. Liam would handle this his own way.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you expect from me, love?\u201d he asked Kim. \u201cWant to test my Collar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to know more about Brian, about Shifters and the Shifter community. Who Brian\u2019s people are, how he grew up, what it\u2019s like to live in a Shifter enclave.\u201d She smiled again. \u201cFinding six independent witnesses who swear he was nowhere near the victim at the time in question wouldn\u2019t hurt either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that all? Bloody miracles is what you want, darling.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped a dark curl around her finger. \u201cBrian said that you\u2019re the Shifter people talk to most. Shifters and humans alike.\u201d</p><p>It was true that Shifters came to Liam with their troubles. His father, Dylan Morrissey, was master of this Shiftertown, second in power in the whole clan.</p> <p>Humans knew little about the careful hierarchy of the Shifter clans and prides\u2014packs for Lupines\u2014and still less about how informally but efficiently everything got done. Dylan was the Morrissey pride leader and the leader of this Shiftertown, and Fergus was the clan leader for the Felines of South Texas, but Shifters with a problem sought out Liam or his brother Sean for a chat. They\u2019d meet in the bar or at the coffee shop around the corner. So, Liam, can you ask your father to look into it for me?</p><p>No one would petition Dylan or Fergus directly. That wasn\u2019t done. But chatting about things to Liam over coffee, that was fine and didn\u2019t draw attention to the fact that the person in question had troubles.</p><p>Everyone would know anyway, of course. Life in a Shiftertown reminded Liam very much of life in the Irish village he\u2019d lived near until they\u2019d come to Texas twenty years ago. Everyone knew everything about everyone, and news traveled, lightning-swift, from one side of the village to the other.</p><p>\u201cBrian never came to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI never knew anything about this human girl until suddenly the police swoop in here and arrest him. His mother struggled out of bed to watch her son be dragged away. She didn\u2019t even know why for days.\u201d</p><p>Kim watched Liam\u2019s blue eyes harden. The Shifters were angry about Brian\u2019s arrest, that was certain. Citizens of Austin had tensely waited for the Shifters to make trouble after the arrest, to break free and try to retaliate with violence, but Shiftertown remained quiet. Kim wondered why, but she wasn\u2019t about to ask right now and risk angering the one person who might help her.</p><p>\u201cExactly my point,\u201d she said. \u201cThis case has been handled badly from start to finish. If you help me, I can spring Brian and make a point at the same time. You don\u2019t mess with people\u2019s rights, not even Shifters\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes grew harder, if that were possible. It was like looking at living sapphire. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about making a point. I give a damn about Brian\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>All right, so she\u2019d miscalculated about what would motivate him. \u201cIn that case, Brian\u2019s family will be happier with him outside prison, not inside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t go to prison, love. He\u2019ll be executed, and you know it. No waiting twenty years on death row, either. They\u2019ll kill him, and they\u2019ll kill him fast.\u201d</p><p>That was true. The prosecutor, the county sheriff, the attorney general, and even the governor wanted an example made of Brian. There hadn\u2019t been a Shifter attack in twenty years, and the Texas government wanted to assure the world that they weren\u2019t going to allow one now.</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to help me save him?\u201d Kim asked. If he wanted to be direct and to the point, fine. So could she. \u201cOr let him die?\u201d</p><p>Anger flickered through Liam\u2019s eyes again, then sorrow and frustration. Shifters were emotional people from what she\u2019d seen in Brian, not bothering to hide what they felt. Brian had lashed out at Kim many times before he\u2019d grudgingly acknowledged that she was on his side.</p><p>If Liam decided to stonewall her, Brian had said, Kim had no hope of getting cooperation from the other Shifters. Even Brian\u2019s own mother would take her cue from Liam.</p><p>Liam had the look of a man who didn\u2019t take shit from anyone. A man used to giving the orders himself, but so far he hadn\u2019t seemed brutal. He could make his voice soft and lilting, reassuring, friendly. He was a defender, she guessed. A protector of his people.</p><p>Was he deciding whether to protect Brian or turn his back?</p><p>Liam\u2019s gaze flicked past her to the door, every line of his body coming alert. Kim\u2019s nerves made her jump. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Liam got out of his chair and started around the desk at the same time the door scraped open and another man\u2014another Shifter\u2014walked in.</p><p>Liam\u2019s expression changed. \u201cSean.\u201d He clasped the other Shifter\u2019s arms and pulled him into a hug.</p><p>More than a hug. Kim watched, open-mouthed, as Liam wrapped his arms around the other man, gathered him close, and nuzzled his cheek.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Kim made herself close her gaping mouth and turn away. None of her business if Liam Morrissey was g*y. Seriously disappointing, but none of her business.</p><p>The second man held Liam in a tight hug, then with a thump of fists on backs, they released each other. Liam smiled\u2014man, how gorgeous was he when he smiled? He had his arm around the second man\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSean, this is Kim,\u201d Liam said. \u201cShe wants me to help her with Brian.\u201d</p><p>Sean had dark hair and blue eyes like Liam, and a body as honed, but his face was harder, his look sterner. He had a stillness in him that wasn\u2019t in Liam, as though something had happened to him that he\u2019d never quite gotten over.</p><p>\u201cDoes she now?\u201d Sean was saying. \u201cAnd what did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to explain when you barged in without warning me. What if I\u2019d thought you were a Lupine? I\u2019d have taken your head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sense of smell\u2019s that bad, Liam, that you\u2019d mistake your own brother for a wolfman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your brother?\u201d Kim asked in a shaky voice.</p><p>\u201cMy brother, Sean Morrissey.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s face heated. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Liam still had his arm firmly around the other man. \u201cWhy? Who\u2019d you think he was?\u201d</p><p>Kim tried to control her embarrassment. \u201cI thought you were a couple.\u201d</p><p>Liam burst out laughing, a warm sound. Sean smiled slightly. \u201cAre all humans this crazy?\u201d he asked Liam.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all that ignorant,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to let her talk to Brian\u2019s mum.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s smile faded, and he and Liam exchanged a look that held caution, warning. Because they didn\u2019t trust humans? Or something more?</p><p>Both men focused on Kim again. No one could look at someone like a Shifter. They saw everything, missed nothing. She found that having two equally good-looking men give her the once-over wasn\u2019t bad, even if they were Shifters, potentially dangerous and potentially deadly.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d she made herself say. \u201cHere\u2019s my card. Call me when you\u2019ve set something up with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant I\u2019d take you around now,\u201d Liam said. \u201cNo time like the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now? Without warning? Not always a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll know we\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>Kim shrugged, pretending to share their nonchalance. Her years as a lawyer had made her anal\u2014make appointments, keep detailed records, cover your ass on everything. Their casualness unnerved her.</p><p>And yet she sensed these men weren\u2019t relaxed at all. Liam and Sean shared another look, an unspoken warning, as if they were communicating something she couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>But whatever. Kim had a job to do, and Brian had said that getting Liam\u2019s help was key.</p><p>She walked out the door Liam held open, her head up, trying not to melt when she passed between the two men\u2019s extraordinary heat.</p><p>They walked to Brian\u2019s house. Kim had been preparing to share the close space of her car with two Shifters, but found herself walking slightly behind Liam, with Sean behind her.</p><p>The house wasn\u2019t far. A couple of blocks, that was all, Liam assured her. He wasn\u2019t the one in the four-inch heels, she wanted to growl. Kim\u2019s shiny black pumps were great for office meetings, bad for hiking.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a hardship following Liam, though. The man had a fine ass cupped by snug jeans, and he walked easily in the heat. No wonder people came to Liam with their problems\u2014he looked like a man who\u2019d invite you to rest your head on his shoulder while he made everything bad go away. His brother had the same height and build, the same strength, the same blue eyes, but Kim would gravitate to Liam if she had to choose. Sean had a wariness, a pulling back that she didn\u2019t sense in Liam.</p><p>The first block had a convenience store with a littered parking lot on one corner; another bar, closed, on the opposite end; and a boarded-up store and two bungalows left over from better times crammed in the middle. No one but the three of them walked here, and any street traffic sped through to newer and more prosperous parts of town.</p><p>Liam led Kim around the corner behind the derelict buildings. They passed through a wide-open gate in a chain-link fence and crossed a field. Kim winced and watched where she stepped, knowing her legs and feet would be open season for Texas chiggers.</p><p>When they reached the other end of the field, Kim stopped so quickly that Sean almost ran into her.</p><p>\u201cThis is Shiftertown?\u201d</p><p>Liam grinned. \u201cNot what you expected, eh, love?\u201d</p><p>Kim had thought Shiftertown would be a slum, a ghetto of people not wanted in other parts of town. The houses were small and old, yes. The street itself was cracked and potholed because the city deemed repairs there a low priority. But Kim looked down the street at what appeared to be a beautiful and comfortable suburb. Every yard was green, with gardens or flower boxes running riot with summer flowers. The buildings were painted and in good repair, and most houses had deep porches filled with plants and furniture.</p><p>There were no fences anywhere. Kids played in yards and ran between houses without fear. One front yard sported a plastic wading pool filled with kids and a couple of dogs, while two moms watched from the porch steps. They were young women, casual in shorts and baggy T-shirts, legs stretched to the sun while the kids played. Everyone in the yard and on the porch, including the dogs, wore collars. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One of the women looked up and waved. \u201cGood day to you, Liam,\u201d she called. \u201cHello, Sean.\u201d The other woman raised her hand in greeting but didn\u2019t speak. Kim felt the gazes of both Shifter women on her dark gray suit and stupidly high heels.</p><p>Liam and Sean gave them a casual wave back. The kids jumped up and down, and one sent a big splash of water over the edge of the pool.</p><p>\u201cLook, Liam, I\u2019ve got my own swimming pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s grand, Michael. You look after your brother now.\u201d</p> <p>Michael turned to the littlest child in the pool, who was splashing happily. \u201cI will,\u201d the older boy said seriously.</p><p>They moved on. The Shifters didn\u2019t hide in their houses, the way residents did in Kim\u2019s neighborhood. They roamed outside in the hot weather, working in the yard, looking after kids, talking to their neighbors. Everyone they passed waved or smiled at Liam and Sean, some greeting them, \u201cNow then, Liam. How\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>By the time they reached the end of the block, Kim understood how Brian\u2019s mother would know they were on their way without Liam calling ahead. Every Shifter they passed noted Liam and Sean, every Shifter recognized Kim for the human stranger she was. Someone would be on the phone or running through the backyards to alert Brian\u2019s mother.</p><p>Brian had been living with his mother, Sandra Smith, at 445B Marble Lane, Kim knew from her files. She\u2019d assumed the address meant an apartment or duplex, but it turned out to be a house set behind another house. A driveway ran past 445A and stopped at the garage of 445B.</p><p>Both houses had the look of the 1920s or \u201930s, low-roofed bungalows with brick-pillared porches, dormer windows, and separate garages. The front screen door opened as they approached, and a slender woman leaned against the doorframe.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brought her then,\u201d she said.</p><p>Kim had never met Sandra Smith. When Kim first started putting together the case, she had requested that Sandra come to Kim\u2019s office and talk to her. Sandra had refused, and after a while had stopped answering the phone when Kim called. That was part of the reason Kim wanted to talk to Liam, to find someone who could help her build a solid defense for Brian.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind the intrusion, Mrs. Smith,\u201d Kim began as they approached the porch.</p><p>Sandra abruptly turned and went inside, the screen door banging behind her. Kim winced. This interview was not going to be easy.</p><p>Liam and Sean pushed past Kim to enter the house, no human custom of standing back to let a lady through a door first. Brian had explained the apparent rudeness to her. To a Shifter, letting a female enter a room or building ahead of a male was ludicrous. You couldn\u2019t be sure what danger lurked on the other side. The male checked it out and then gave the all clear for the female to enter. How could you protect your mate otherwise?</p><p>Kim followed them inside and stopped in surprise. Sean had taken Sandra into his arms, letting her lean against him while he rubbed his cheek on her hair. Liam moved to stand behind Sandra. Very close behind Sandra. He rested his chest on her back and both he and Sean murmured to her.</p> <p>This was crazy. The way Liam had greeted his brother had made Kim think the two of them had something going on. Now she swore the brothers and Sandra were in a threesome.</p><p>Liam and Sean stepped away from Sandra, and Sandra wiped her eyes. Kim was struck by how young the woman looked, too young to have a twenty-five-year-old son. Sandra could be thirty, though her eyes spoke of a woman who\u2019d seen far more of the world than Kim had.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you coffee, Ms. Fraser?\u201d Sandra asked, her voice shaky.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Kim said. \u201cDon\u2019t go to any trouble.\u201d</p><p>Sean smiled at Sandra. \u201cI think a big pot would be grand, Sandra. I\u2019ll help you, shall I?\u201d</p><p>Sandra softened under his look, and she and Sean walked to the back of the house to the kitchen. Sean went in first, then ushered Sandra in with his hand on the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Kim asked Liam.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Kim. You look all out.\u201d</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t really expected him to answer. Kim collapsed to the sofa with a grimace and laid her briefcase on the coffee table. Her feet were killing her. She ran her finger inside her shoes, but it didn\u2019t do much good.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurting?\u201d Liam sat down next to her\u2014right next to her, inside her personal space. \u201cLet me see your feet.\u201d</p><p>Kim blinked. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you limping. Get those ridiculous shoes off and swing your feet up here.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were so damn blue. Why did she suddenly long to feel his warm hands on her feet, on her ankles, up her legs under her skirt to where her stockings ended at bare thigh...?</p><p>He was a Shifter. This wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think that would that look? For the mother of the man I\u2019m defending to come back in and find you giving me a foot massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d think it was the first sensible thing you did. You hide behind those clothes like they\u2019re a suit of armor. She\u2019ll not open up to you if you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she will if I play footsie with you?\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled a heart-thumping smile. \u201cGet your damn shoes off, woman.\u201d</p><p>Oh, to hell with it. When in Rome...or Shiftertown.</p><p>Kim couldn\u2019t stop her groan of relief as she eased the heels from her feet. Liam patted his lap. Kim leaned into the corner of the couch and plopped her ankles on Liam\u2019s thigh.</p><p>\u201cIs everything in Shiftertown backward?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBackward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen enter a room first, it\u2019s better to kick off your shoes on a stranger\u2019s couch than be businesslike, and you say hello by rubbing yourselves all over each other.\u201d Kim sagged in pleasure as he moved strong hands over her feet. \u201cOoh, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s thumb traveled over her arch to her heel, his touch warm. Did the man know how to loosen tension, or what?</p><p>Another groan escaped her. \u201cThis is better than any day spa I\u2019ve been to. You could make money doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters aren\u2019t allowed in any profession where they touch humans.\u201d His voice went soft. \u201cWe might bite.\u201d</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t think she\u2019d mind being nibbled on by him. Her nervousness about Shifters hadn\u2019t quite drifted away, but Liam was dissolving her fears little by little, at least about him. \u201cI think I\u2019d make an exception for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPheromones.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean and I felt Sandra\u2019s distress, and we calmed her down. She needed our touch. Like you need me rubbing your feet.\u201d</p><p>Kim thought about their caressing, group hug. \u201cShe must have been very distressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. Why wouldn\u2019t she be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Sean distressed when he came in your office? You hugged him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I hugged him. He\u2019s my brother. Don\u2019t you hug your brother or your sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a family,\u201d Kim said. She couldn\u2019t keep the sorrow out of her voice. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Liam gave her a look of open pity. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re so tense. What happened to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Kim had always thought it best not to open up, but Liam\u2019s blue eyes and gentle voice pried something loose. \u201cIt\u2019s no big secret. My brother Mark died when I was ten. He was twelve. He was hit by a car while he was walking down to a corner store with his friends\u2014a hit and run. My parents passed away a few years ago, within months of each other. Old age, is all. They had their kids late in life. So now it\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>The story was simple, easy to relate. Her grief had burned away to emptiness long ago. She lived in the big house she\u2019d inherited from her parents, and it was\u2014so quiet. She tried to cheer it up with weekend parties or office mixers, but the warmth never lasted. Her parents\u2019 neighborhood was one of standoffish elegance; no kids would dare splash in plastic pools in any front yard on her street.</p><p>Liam gently squeezed her feet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for you, Kim Fraser. It\u2019s the hardest thing, losing a brother. It\u2019s like losing a part of yourself.\u201d</p><p>He was too right. Kim\u2019s next words came reluctantly. \u201cWhen Mark was killed, I blamed myself. I know that\u2019s stupid. I was at a friend\u2019s house miles away, and I was ten years old\u2014what could I have done? But I kept thinking that if I\u2019d been there, I could have warned him, pulled him out of the way, kept him home altogether. Something.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s warm, relaxing fingers slid beneath each of her toes. \u201cSean and me, we had a brother. Kenny. We lost him about ten years ago. You always wonder, if you\u2019d persuaded him to do something different that day, would he still be alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d After seventeen years, Kim had never found anyone who really understood, not friends or colleagues or the child counselor she\u2019d been hauled off to. Now a Shifter she\u2019d met an hour ago wrung the truth from her heart. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Liam. About your brother.\u201d</p><p>He acknowledged the sympathy with a nod. \u201cDid they ever get the bastard who hit Mark?\u201d</p><p>Kim shook her head. \u201cThe police picked up a guy, but it turned out he didn\u2019t do it. Everyone wanted him to be guilty, wanted someone to blame, but I knew he hadn\u2019t done it when I saw him. He was so scared, and his wife was crying, and I said it wasn\u2019t him\u2014but of course, how could I know? I was a kid and hadn\u2019t even been there. In the end, evidence came to light that cleared him. But everyone was pissed that he was innocent. They couldn\u2019t catch the real guy, so they wanted a substitute.\u201d</p><p>His hands slowed. \u201cIs that when you decided to become a defense attorney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wanted to be a doctor.\u201d She grinned. \u201cOr a dancer, I couldn\u2019t decide. I was ten. But I wanted the right guy to pay. I knew that if the wrong person went to prison, then whoever really did hit my brother would have hurt that many more people, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell reasoned for a ten-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about it. A lot. For a while, I couldn\u2019t think about anything else.\u201d Hence the child counselor.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He looked grim again.</p><p>Kim wanted to ask how his brother had died, but at that moment Sandra and Sean returned with the coffee. Kim tried to jerk her feet from Liam\u2019s lap, but he closed his hands around her ankles and held them fast. She glared, and he smiled back, showing her nice white teeth.</p><p>Sean set a tray on the table. It held the whole works: cups, a pot, cream, and sugar. No artificial sweetener. Kim wondered whether that was because Sandra didn\u2019t like artificial sweetener or whether Shifters never had to worry about their weight.</p><p>Sandra didn\u2019t look surprised or shocked that Kim had her stockinged feet in Liam\u2019s lap. She poured out a cup of coffee and handed it to Kim without comment.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell us, Kim,\u201d Sean said, as he sat down and took his cup, \u201cis there any chance for Brian?\u201d</p><p>Kim couldn\u2019t lie to them. \u201cBrian\u2019s DNA was on the victim, Michelle, and in her bedroom, and now that everyone watches CSI, they figure DNA is the magic truth. But Brian says he\u2019d been dating Michelle and had gone to her house, so of course his DNA would be there and on her too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what can we do?\u201d Sandra asked, angry. \u201cIf this DNA has already convicted him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can prove he was nowhere near the scene of the crime that night,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m here. Neither the private investigator I hired nor my journalist friend who\u2019s been following the case can find any information on his whereabouts that night. I mean, no information at all. Like he\u2019d vanished for twenty-four hours. But I can\u2019t believe no one saw Brian or knew where he was going.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hell, everyone on this street had known within minutes that Liam and Sean were taking the human lawyer to Brian\u2019s house. They probably knew Kim\u2019s full name and her favorite color by now. \u201cI\u2019m having the investigator look into Michelle\u2019s side of things\u2014see if she had a jealous ex or an abusive father, or even a normally nice friend upset that Michelle was dating a Shifter. I\u2019m trying to find any evidence the police overlooked in their zeal to arrest a Shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour investigator came around and asked me questions.\u201d Sandra sounded pissed about it. \u201cBut Brian didn\u2019t tell me himself he was walking out with this girl, so how could I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you might know something that can help,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know this is painful for you, but Brian\u2019s clammed up about Michelle, so I have to poke and pry. I think getting him released is more important than keeping his personal secrets, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Sandra had a bit of the same Irish lilt as Sean and Liam, but Brian didn\u2019t. He\u2019d told Kim that his father came from a different clan, she guessed not an Irish one. Either that or his clan had lost their accent after living in Texas awhile.</p> <p>Kim didn\u2019t really understand how the Shifter clans worked, though Brian had tried to explain a little. She knew that each immediate family belonged to a larger, extended family group called a pride, and they belonged to an even more extended group called a clan. Shifters never married within the pride, and tried to marry outside the clan. When a female married, she joined her husband\u2019s clan and pride, leaving her own. Kim had thought clans were based on what kind of animal the Shifter turned into, but Brian said it was more complicated than that. This Shiftertown was home to several clans, as well as several species of Shifters, and there was another Shiftertown with more clans on the northeast edge of Austin.</p><p>Liam\u2019s father, Dylan Morrissey, was more or less the official head of the Austin branch of his entire clan, but also the unofficial head of this Shiftertown, even over the other clans. But no, Kim couldn\u2019t talk directly to Dylan, Brian told her. He was off-limits to non-Shifters. She could petition him through Liam and Liam only.</p><p>Why not Sean? Kim wondered, glancing at Liam\u2019s brother. What position did he hold in the clan hierarchy? Officially and unofficially?</p><p>Sean helped himself to coffee and exchanged a glance with Liam. \u201cSo you need to find someone who was with Brian at the time in question?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Kim could have sworn that Liam had nodded ever so slightly, as though letting Sean know it was all right to say this. Nonverbal cues were flowing thick and fast.</p> <p>\u201cAn independent witness would be terrific,\u201d Kim said. \u201cSomeone without a grudge against Shifters. And preferably not a Shifter him- or herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTall order,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cThe girl is human,\u201d Sandra snapped. \u201cWhat human will come forward and say my son didn\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>She had a point. Kim knew that locating a witness was a long shot, but it would be a nice change to find something concrete. Innocent until proven guilty was not working in Brian\u2019s case. The fact that he was Shifter had already condemned him in most people\u2019s eyes. Kim had to exonerate him or he didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>Liam started massaging the tops of Kim\u2019s feet, which made her tense limbs start to droop.</p><p>\u201cI might be able to find out where Brian really was,\u201d Liam said. \u201cYou should have come to me about this right away, love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that, did I? Like I said, Brian is the first Shifter I\u2019ve ever met, and to get him to tell me that you, Liam, even existed was an amazing feat.\u201d Brian hadn\u2019t bothered to mention Sean.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t like talking about ourselves,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. Shifters exposed themselves years ago, and everyone knows all about you. There\u2019s nothing to hide anymore.\u201d</p><p>She felt the three exchange another wordless communication, and it irritated her. It reminded her of being eight years old and watching her two best friends whispering and giving her gleeful looks, not letting her in on the secret.</p><p>A cell phone vibrated on Liam\u2019s belt. He looked at the readout, and without a word gently lowered Kim\u2019s feet to the floor. He stood and walked to the kitchen, closing the door, shutting them out.</p><p>Kim felt cold without his warmth beside her, even in the July heat. \u201cAnything you can tell me might help,\u201d she said to Sean and Sandra. \u201cRight now I can only win this case by tearing holes in the prosecution, and there aren\u2019t many holes. I need something that will stick a fork in the case and shred it.\u201d</p><p>Sandra drank her coffee, her gaze moving from Kim to the windows. Kim caught a glimpse of her sadness as she looked away, her near despair.</p><p>She\u2019s resigning herself to losing her son, Kim realized. Sandra thought there was no hope. She\u2019d already started grieving for him.</p> <p>Sean was watching Kim with an assessing look. She still wasn\u2019t sure about him, or where the haunted feeling she got from him came from.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to lose, Sandra,\u201d Kim said briskly. \u201cI want to see Brian walk free and the real person pay for his crime. I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>Sandra didn\u2019t answer. Sean nodded at Kim. \u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Liam strode back into the room. Kim realized that the other two had said very little while Liam had been gone. Had he signaled them not to? And why?</p><p>Liam took up his coffee cup without sitting down and took a long swallow. He looked over the rim at Sean, who came alert.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d Kim asked. \u201cDid you get bad news?\u201d</p><p>Liam clicked his mug to the tray. \u201cNo, an errand Sean and I need to run. I appreciate you coming all the way out to Shiftertown, Kim Fraser, but now it\u2019s time for you to go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kim demanded as she strode down the driveway with Liam. \u201cI just get you talking, and suddenly you\u2019re throwing me out.\u201d</p><p>Liam looked down at the fuming woman next to him. Sunlight danced on her black hair, the afternoon warmth making her smell good.</p><p>He was finding her enticing, even when she was mad as hell. When he\u2019d announced the interview was over, she\u2019d jammed her shoes on her feet, said a sweet good-bye to Sandra, and stalked out. Now as they walked back down the driveway, she glared at him.</p><p>\u201cSandra was uncomfortable,\u201d he offered. \u201cShe\u2019s not easy around humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? Are you comfortable around us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. But more than she and Sean are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you work at a bar?\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged. \u201cHumans like to see Shifters in bars. It brings in business.\u201d She didn\u2019t need to know the real reason he worked there.</p><p>They\u2019d reached the sidewalk in front of 445A. Kim swung to face him with hands planted on hips. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help. Why does Sandra believe Brian has no chance? I\u2019m on the case.\u201d</p><p>Liam hid a smile. She was like a fox terrier determined to bring down a lion. He admired her balls, first in believing Brian\u2019s innocence, and second, for coming down to meet big, dangerous Shifters like him and Sean. She didn\u2019t realize how dangerous her pilgrimage was, and Liam wasn\u2019t going to tell her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you on the case should be good enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Mr. Morrissey. Michelle and her family will only get closure if the right guy goes down.\u201d</p><p>Liam lifted his hands. \u201cI agree with you, love. It\u2019s not me you have to convince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you tell me anything?\u201d She regarded him with suspicion. \u201cSomething\u2019s going on. You and Sean know it. Sandra knows it. Hell, Brian knows it. I\u2019m the only one in the dark. Help me out here.\u201d</p><p>Liam put his hands on her shoulders, and her blue eyes flickered with discomfort. Why did humans worry so much about touching? \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to you. You\u2019re the first human we\u2019ve met who cares about Shifters. But you have to let me handle it from here.\u201d</p><p>If she didn\u2019t, Kim could die. Liam had already broken Fergus\u2019s rules by not placating her and sending her away at once, but Fergus could stuff it.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell Kim that he didn\u2019t know all that was going on, either. Sandra was hiding something, even from Liam, and it annoyed Liam that he didn\u2019t know what.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d Kim asked him. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have even come to talk to you, but I\u2019m desperate. I have to be very careful about every point I have, so whatever you come up with will have to be checked and double-checked. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you, it\u2019s that I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Liam circled his thumbs on her shoulders. \u201cWell, you will have to trust me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>A shiver went through her body. She wanted to be touched; he could feel it. She needed it. But she fought it. Humans.</p><p>She glanced at his hands. \u201cHas anyone ever told you that you\u2019re not PC?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, because I enjoy touching your soft skin and call you sweetheart? Or because I won\u2019t let you have it your own way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the phone call you took about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now you\u2019re prying into my business, are you? It was personal. Do you have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cTalk about personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Liam repeated. \u201cSomeone special in your life?\u201d</p><p>Kim pursed her lips as though she had to think about it. \u201cYes, a boyfriend. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you sure, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t go out much. We\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Liam leaned toward her. She smelled nice, this human. He liked her hair, all silky and curly, and he wanted to bury his nose in it.</p><p>\u201cIf I had someone like you, love, I\u2019d be with her all the time. I wouldn\u2019t want her out of my sight. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t let her run around Shiftertown by herself. What is this man thinking about?\u201d</p><p>Kim looked annoyed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs to take better care of you.\u201d</p><p>Indignation now. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to take care of me at all. I\u2019m my own person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Liam leaned closer, feeling his eyes change as he inhaled her scent. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in Shiftertown, I take care of you. No one will bother you here, I promise you that. They\u2019ll answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019ll come to Shiftertown again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so.\u201d</p><p>Liam slid his arms around her and drew her close. She resisted. He traced patterns on her lower back and rested his cheek on her hair until she softened a little. He was right; her hair was silky and warm.</p><p>Kim started to relax against him, her body reacting to his. He needed to protect her. He\u2019d made that decision the minute she\u2019d walked into his office, to protect her from all other Shifters, most of all the leader of his own clan. \u201cEverything will be all right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I want to believe you?\u201d She sounded skeptical.</p><p>She had a nice voice, low and contralto. He imagined her whispering to him as she lay next to him in bed. Her hair would tangle on his pillow, and wouldn\u2019t she be pretty? He could understand keeping his human form for lovemaking if the human was Kim Fraser.</p><p>He straightened up and brushed a curl from her face. \u201cGive me your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can admire the fine technology a human woman can afford to buy.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cI want to give you my phone number. What did you think?\u201d</p><p>Kim pulled her cell phone out of a pocket of her briefcase and handed it to him. The phone was fancy, as he\u2019d suspected, with all kinds of buttons and extras. Shifters were allowed to have only old models, recycled, most of the features disabled. Not that some Shifters didn\u2019t futz with them on the sly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Liam started punching buttons. \u201cI\u2019m programming in my private number. For you only. If you need something, you call me. Any time of the day or night.\u201d</p><p>Kim watched as he tucked the cell phone back into her briefcase. \u201cAnytime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I call every hour to check on your progress?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you do.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cYou trust me a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m asking you to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Kim chewed on her lip, making it red and cute. \u201cI suppose I can see that.\u201d She held out her hand. \u201cThank you for your help, Mr. Morrissey. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Liam put his arm around her waist and turned her around. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving, love. I\u2019m walking you back to your car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s only a few blocks away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, when you\u2019re here, you\u2019re under my protection. Do you think that means I\u2019d abandon you right here on the sidewalk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I\u2019m walking you to your car.\u201d</p><p>She made a noise of exasperation. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Liam wanted to laugh. She was adorable, his fox terrier. And determined.</p> <p>And bloody inconvenient. The phone call had been from his father, telling Liam news he\u2019d been waiting to hear. Ms. Lawyer needed to get out of Shiftertown. Liam and Sean suddenly had other things they needed to take care of.</p><p>Liam liked Kim\u2019s curves against his body as they walked, her narrow waist under his hand. She didn\u2019t try to break away from him, resigned, it seemed, to let him walk with his arm around her. As if they were a couple, in human terms.</p><p>Something warmed inside him, a space filling. Liam abruptly cut off the feeling. He could not afford to get involved with her. Protect her, yes; enjoy her, no. No matter how tempting she was.</p><p>Kim was breathing rapidly at their pace, her ridiculously high heels slowing her down. He wished she\u2019d kick off her shoes and peel off her stockings and walk barefoot in the grass. He imagined her strolling along beside him, shoes in hand, a smile on her face.</p><p>Too soon they reached her car, a black two-door Mustang. The car chirped as she pushed the button to unlock it.</p><p>Liam pulled her into another hug. Kim resisted again, but he scooped her against him, letting his mouth rest on the curve of her neck. She was warm, her skin salty, her pulse beating under his lips.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye then, Kim. You take care.\u201d</p><p>He meant it. There was danger out there, and Brian\u2019s troubles were only part of it.</p> <p>Kim took the card from her pocket that she\u2019d tried to hand him earlier. \u201cYou\u2019ll call my office as soon as you have anything for me, right? Anything at all?\u201d</p><p>Liam turned the card around in his fingers, savoring the feel of the raised letters of her name. \u201cOf course, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to answer. Liam opened the car door for her, and Kim gave him a flustered look before tossing her briefcase inside.</p><p>Liam smoothed her hair from her face. He could stand all day looking at her, breathing in her scent, touching her sleek hair.</p><p>He let her go. He wasn\u2019t allowed to have her, no matter that he was hot and hard for her. She was beautiful, but not for him.</p><p>Kim gave him a smile, one that heated his blood, and slid into her driver\u2019s seat. She cranked the engine, let it roar to life, then reached over to switch the AC to high.</p><p>She rolled down the window, sending a trickle of cool air over his skin. \u201cThanks, Liam,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound ungrateful. I\u2019m just worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all are, love.\u201d He stood up, patted the roof of the car. \u201cYou go on, now.\u201d</p><p>The window slid silently upward. Kim gave him one last nervous smile, then pulled the car onto the street. The taillights flashed red before she turned a corner, and then she was gone.</p><p>Liam might never see her again. The emptiness of that hit him.</p><p>No, that wouldn\u2019t happen. She was under his protection now. He had her phone number and her address. He\u2019d make sure she\u2019d need to speak to him again, and he\u2019d make sure she had to see him in person to do it.</p><p>When Liam reached home after picking up Sean from Sandra\u2019s, their father Dylan was there. Three generations of males lived in the Morrisseys\u2019 two-story bungalow\u2014father, two sons, and Liam\u2019s nephew, Connor.</p><p>Connor was twenty, tall and lanky, still a cub by Shifter standards. By human standards, he was old enough to go to college, and Connor had been attending a community college this year. Shifters weren\u2019t allowed to apply to the prestigious UT Austin, but it had been voted to allow them some college-level education. No degrees. Wouldn\u2019t want Shifters taking over professional jobs or learning enough to be a threat.</p><p>Connor\u2019s classes were out for the summer, and he passed the time catching up on DVDs. Laws forbade Shifters access to TiVo or premium cable for some reason, so movie rental outlets near Shiftertown did big business. Connor was watching The Howling and laughing his ass off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to go with him, Liam,\u201d Dylan said as soon as Liam walked in, continuing the conversation he\u2019d had with Liam on the phone.</p><p>Liam gave a grim nod as he got himself a Guinness from the refrigerator. Dylan had told him that Fergus\u2019s trackers located a feral Shifter east of town, one that had slaughtered a Shifter woman and her cubs a few nights ago.</p><p>May hell rot all feral Shifters, Liam thought. He and Sean had found the bodies, a devastating sight that made his heart ache. As Guardian, it was Sean\u2019s duty to dispatch the feral, but Liam was looking forward to exacting some justice of his own. Besides, no way he\u2019d let his brother face the attacker alone. Not after what had happened to Kenny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go too,\u201d Connor said. He\u2019d come silently out of the living room and leaned against the breakfast bar in the kitchen. \u201cIf it\u2019s a simple takedown.\u201d</p><p>Dylan gave Connor a look of compassion. Dylan\u2019s dark hair had gone gray at the temples in the last few years, finally making him look older than his sons. But a Shifter\u2019s eyes, not his human shell, betrayed his age. Dylan\u2019s eyes had seen much.</p><p>\u201cNo, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a cub anymore, and I need to learn to fight these bastards.\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s father, Kenny, had been ripped to shreds by a feral Shifter. Their family had avenged the death long ago, but Connor had been too young to participate. The need for personal vengeance burned in him. But not only did Connor look twenty, he was twenty in human years. His fighting ability would take another decade or so to hone.</p><p>Liam drew his lanky nephew into a hug. \u201cLike you said, lad, it\u2019s a simple takedown. We\u2019ll get him and go out for pizza.\u201d Liam kept his voice light, though he was buzzing with adrenaline. He was more than ready to get on with it.</p><p>Connor rolled his eyes as Liam released him. \u201cYou and Sean are so condescending it makes me sick. You have human scent all over you, Liam. What have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>Sean grinned as he pulled a beer out of the refrigerator. \u201cYou should have seen him. He meets this human lady, and ten minutes later he\u2019s massaging her feet. He wouldn\u2019t leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>Liam threw his bottle cap at him. Sean snatched the cap out of the air and threw it back.</p><p>\u201cShe needs protecting,\u201d Liam said, catching the cap in turn and tossing it to the counter. \u201cShe\u2019s busting her ass for Shifters, the little idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave for a human,\u201d Dylan said. He was the only one in the room who didn\u2019t look amused.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s brave, but she\u2019s innocent. I scent-marked her so other Shifters will leave her the hell alone. They\u2019ll know that if they bother her, they answer to me. That goes for Fergus\u2019s thugs too.\u201d</p><p>Dylan watched him closely, and Liam pretended not to hold his breath as he drank his beer. Whose side would Dylan take? The clan leader\u2019s? Or Liam\u2019s? It was never certain.</p><p>Dylan gave Liam a slow nod. \u201cIf Fergus asks, I\u2019ll tell him I sanctioned it.\u201d</p><p>Liam relaxed. He went to his father and clasped his shoulder in thanks, then returned to the refrigerator. \u201cWe might as well eat while we wait. How about old-fashioned burgers on the grill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrand idea.\u201d Sean sauntered into the living room and threw himself on the couch. He crossed his feet and leaned his head back on his folded hands. \u201cMake mine medium rare and put a slice of cheese on it, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Connor sprawled on the floor and took the DVD off Pause. \u201cRare for me, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGobshites,\u201d Liam growled, but he pulled the meat out of the freezer and stuck it in the microwave to thaw.</p><p>As he started up the grill outside and formed the burgers, leaving out all the onions and salt and crap that humans littered their meat with, he thought about Kim. How she smelled, how she felt. How her blue eyes could open so wide that her lashes curled against her skin. Her dark hair had gleamed in the sunlight, revealing golden highlights.</p><p>He wondered what she was doing now. Back at her office, hunched over a desk? Talking to Brian at the jail? Reading thick law books to see what she could do for a Shifter?</p><p>She\u2019d go home soon. Liam had easily found where she lived when her secretary had contacted him earlier this week. A simple computer search had sufficed, even on dial-up\u2014no cable modems for Shifters. Why the human government thought not allowing Shifters cable or wireless or good cell phones would slow down their communications, he didn\u2019t know. Humans had weird ideas.</p><p>What would Kim do when she got home? Peel off that severe gray suit, most likely. Would she wear sexy underwear beneath it? Did all-work-and-no-play Kim Fraser buy herself shimmering lingerie?</p><p>Liam pictured her in a silk camisole that barely contained her lush br**sts, maybe bikini panties baring most of her butt. Or not a camisole, but a tiny lace bra that pushed her br**sts up and barely covered her ni**les. Stockings, not panty hose. With a garter belt. She\u2019d walk around her house in that, loosening up after work, pouring herself a glass of wine. Or maybe she was a down-home Texas girl who\u2019d reach for a cold beer.</p><p>Liam imagined the beads of moisture on the beer bottle in the humid summer evening. Kim\u2019s lips would skim the bottle\u2019s mouth until she upended it and poured a cool stream of beer down her throat.</p><p>He imagined it so vividly that Sean\u2019s and Connor\u2019s burgers traveled way past rare to well done before Liam could rescue them.</p><p>Kim got out of her leisurely bath and went back to her bedroom with one towel around her torso and the other turbaned over her hair.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten used to living by herself\u2014unless Abel came over\u2014no parents or siblings or anyone else. No dogs or cats, either, because she was gone most of the day, and she didn\u2019t want to subject a pet to so much neglect. Or maybe she just didn\u2019t want to mourn when it grew old, died, and left another hole in her life.</p><p>Tonight she felt the emptiness. She\u2019d tried to fill it by e-mailing her friend Silas, a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist doing research for a documentary on Shifters, and then taking a luxurious soak. She\u2019d tried to lose herself in a delicious novel in the tub, but her thoughts kept drifting and she gave up.</p><p>She reached for an emery board and started sanding her nails. Maybe she felt the emptiness because in Shiftertown she\u2019d noticed the fullness. The kids playing in the front yards, neighbors waving at Sean and Liam, the easy bond between the two brothers.</p><p>She thought about how she\u2019d spilled her guts to Liam and let him massage her aching feet. The rubbing had felt good. She could still feel his touch, the warmth, the sensual firmness of his strong fingers.</p><p>Even better had been his lips on her neck. The man was hot. She had no idea whether Shifters did it like humans, but she knew that if she were a Shifter woman, she\u2019d be working to get him into bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Strangest of all, Liam had listened to her. Kim had told him more in ten minutes than she\u2019d told Abel in the year she\u2019d been dating him.</p><p>Did that say something about Liam or something about Abel?</p><p>Kim set down the emery board and picked up her cell phone. She punched Abel\u2019s number and listened to his phone ring.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he answered. He sounded rushed.</p> <p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim?\u201d He sounded baffled. \u201cWhat is it? Was I supposed to meet you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just thought we could talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Pause as he rustled something on the other end of the phone. \u201cCan I call you back? I\u2019m in the middle of about ten things.\u201d</p><p>Kim waited for her anger to come. But she felt\u2014nothing. \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow. Sleep tight, honey.\u201d Click.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sweet dreams, babe.\u201d Kim keyed off the phone and dropped it on the table. Abel was a workaholic trying to make a name for himself at the firm. Of course he was in the middle of ten things. He always was.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s time to cut that tie, a little voice in the back of her mind said. Maybe it\u2019s beyond time.</p><p>You know you didn\u2019t think that until you met Liam...</p><p>Kim picked up the phone again and scrolled to where Liam had typed in his name and number. It looked so normal, the four letters of his name, then an area code and seven-digit phone number like everyone else had.</p><p>You call me, any time of the day or night.</p> <p>Had he really meant that? Or was it a mere platitude? Call me, honey. Except when I\u2019m busy, watching TV, out with my friends, or not interested in you right now.</p><p>Just to be a pain in the ass, Kim pressed the button to call the number. One ring, and then Liam\u2019s warm voice filled her ear.</p><p>\u201cKim!\u201d As though this was the best call he\u2019d received all day. \u201cYou all right, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Kim said, her entire body warming. \u201cI was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking to see if I\u2019d answer?\u201d Liam\u2019s amusement came across loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. How\u2019s Sandra doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. Sean talked to her. You\u2019re not still working, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always working, Liam. Cases don\u2019t keep a nine-to-five schedule.\u201d</p> <p>His chuckle sent a shiver down her spine. \u201cYou need to stop now and again, sweetheart. Take it from me. I know.\u201d</p><p>Kim realized. \u201cOh, you\u2019re at work now, aren\u2019t you? At the bar. I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, love. Anytime. You rest easy, now.\u201d</p><p>Take that, Abel. \u201cThanks, Liam. You too.\u201d</p><p>A pause. It stretched on.</p><p>\u201cYou still there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sounded suddenly subdued. \u201cGood night, Kim. Call me again tomorrow, all right?\u201d</p><p>She promised to, clicked off the phone, and held it to her lips. Her own boyfriend might or might not remember to call her back, but this Shifter had sounded happy to hear from her, even if he was up to his butt in bar receipts. She wasn\u2019t sure whether that made her feel good or lonelier than ever.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Liam slid his phone into his belt as he mounted his Harley, waiting for Sean to join him. Kim\u2019s voice touched the raw sexual being inside him, the one that had wanted to unfasten her straining blouse buttons in his office. Even more warming was the thought that she\u2019d made the choice to call him.</p><p>He\u2019d stopped himself from asking, What are you doing right now? What are you wearing? Or not wearing?</p><p>Liam thought again of the directions to Kim\u2019s house he\u2019d easily brought up on a computer search. Maybe after this takedown, he\u2019d drive out there to check up on her. Maybe she\u2019d let him in, and maybe he could persuade her up to her bedroom for another foot massage...</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d Sean asked as he straddled the bike behind Liam.</p><p>Liam shifted uncomfortably, willing his growing hard-on to calm down. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Why wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that thing in your pants looks painful.\u201d</p><p>Liam never found it easy to lie to his brother. \u201cI was talking to Kim.\u201d</p><p>Sean started to laugh. He moved the sword strapped to his back to a comfortable position, then slid his arms around Liam\u2019s waist. \u201cYou have it bad, Liam. Give up the dream and go shag a pretty Shifter. Annie maybe.\u201d</p><p>Liam started the bike. \u201cShe works at the bar now. I never get involved with the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say get involved. I said shag her. She\u2019s been happy to oblige you in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you she wants, Sean. I see her sweet gaze following your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get a move on? I\u2019d like to make this kill and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t reply. He knew Sean needed to calm his nerves, and stirring up his big brother was his favorite method.</p><p>Liam glided the bike, a Harley he\u2019d bought for next to nothing and restored, into the street, then turned the corner and drove out of Shiftertown. He headed through crowded streets to the highway that would take them east out of the city. In his rearview mirrors, the skyline of downtown Austin glowed against the dark sky, the lit-up dome of the capitol a yellow beacon.</p><p>They turned down an inky-black road past Bastrop and rode across open country. Fergus\u2019s trackers had called right after Liam and Sean had finished their burgers, saying they\u2019d followed the feral to some abandoned warehouses way east of town. The feral had made camp there, and the shit wasn\u2019t going anywhere, so could Sean and Liam please bestir themselves and come do their jobs?</p><p>If the trackers ran true to form, Liam knew they wouldn\u2019t show their asses if there was any kind of fight. They\u2019d hightail it out of there as soon as Liam and Sean arrived. It was the trackers\u2019 job only to point the way, after all.</p><p>Liam parked well down the road from the warehouse, he and Sean doing the last stretch on foot. A chain-link fence surrounded the property of the once-prosperous business, but the flimsy barrier had been sliced open in plenty of places, with one whole section of it knocked flat. Crickets chirped in loud profusion outside the fence, but once Liam and Sean stepped over the fallen chain link, all animal noises ceased.</p><p>Liam smelled the stench right after that. Even a human would notice it, but to a Shifter the smell was like a body blow. Liam felt his lips curl back, his teeth elongate into fangs.</p><p>He tried to suppress his killing instinct, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Dylan seemed to think he and Sean would come out here and solve the problem in cool detachment. But Dylan hadn\u2019t seen the Shifter woman\u2019s body, hadn\u2019t found her children. Liam wanted to savage, no offers of mercy. So did Sean, probably even more than Liam did.</p><p>Without a word, the brothers separated, Sean unstrapping the sword from his back. Liam moved noiselessly through the shadows of the warehouse and stepped through a door that gaped open to the night.</p><p>The stench made him gag. Liam\u2019s cat\u2019s eyes adjusted to the dark, and he walked forward, scanning each sable shadow.</p><p>Before Liam had made it halfway across the warehouse floor, the feral stepped forward to meet him. He didn\u2019t look as wild as Liam had thought he would. He was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, sweat-soaked in the humid Texas night. Except for being caked with dirt, not wearing a Collar, and his oppressive BO, he looked like any other Shifter from Shiftertown. Of course his neck was so black with filth, Liam wouldn\u2019t have been able to see a Collar if he had one.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you take baths, man?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>The Shifter snarled, his face elongating into something between human and wolf. A Lupine. Bloody wonderful.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s good soap nowadays,\u201d Liam went on. \u201cMakes you sweet as a garden. You should try it. That is, if you\u2019re not busy killing wee ones like the bastard you are.\u201d</p><p>The Lupine grated, \u201cTraitor. Collared pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, lad. Survivor. We don\u2019t go around murdering anymore, didn\u2019t you hear? Especially not the cubs, and damn you don\u2019t know how much I want to kill you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted the woman. Not her spawn by another Shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose days are over, lick-brain.\u201d Liam took the Collar out of his pocket, feeling the strength of the steel, the bite of magic that wound through it. \u201cI\u2019m offering you this chance because my father makes me play by the rules, no matter what. Me, I\u2019d rather kill you.\u201d He stepped forward. \u201cOne size fits all. Come on, take it like a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a man. Neither are you. Are you too weak to fight me, Feline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Liam said. \u201cBut you have two choices. Face me, or face the Guardian.\u201d</p><p>The other Shifter tensed. \u201cThe Guardian isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is.\u201d Sean stepped out of the shadows behind the Shifter. He drew the broadsword, its blade ringing in the still air.</p><p>The Shifter swung to Sean. He inhaled sharply, then whirled back to Liam and did the sniff-fest again.</p><p>\u201cI only smelled...\u201d The Shifter broke off, his light blue wolf eyes fixed on Liam.</p><p>Liam held out the Collar, still offering. \u201cYou take the Collar, I might resist killing you. Maybe you didn\u2019t understand what you were doing. I have about two brain cells that believe that. You refuse...Well, let\u2019s just say our Sean is even more pissed at you than I am.\u201d</p><p>Liam felt the air contract as the man shifted all the way. He didn\u2019t bother taking off his clothes; he let them fray as his wolf\u2019s body split the fabric. Sean waited, and Liam wondered if the Lupine understood how much Sean was holding back. The brothers\u2019 instructions were to kill the feral only as a last resort.</p><p>The wolf shook off the remains of the clothes, his eyes filled with rage. Liam didn\u2019t move. \u201cCome on, lad. Shiftertown pretty much wants you dead without quarter. Dylan convinced me to give you a chance. Don\u2019t throw that away.\u201d</p><p>The wolf snarled. He rose on his hind legs, returning to human form. Now he was naked, not a pretty sight.</p><p>\u201cI smell it on you.\u201d His nostrils flared in contempt. \u201cA human. You scent-marked a human woman.\u201d How the Shifter could smell anything beyond his own stink, Liam didn\u2019t know, but his blood ran cold. \u201cAbomination,\u201d the Shifter hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou know big words, do you?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cLet me give you some short ones: Take the f**king Collar.\u201d</p><p>With a crackle of bones, the Shifter morphed back into a wolf. Liam braced himself for the attack, but the wolf abruptly whirled and sprinted in the other direction.</p><p>Sean was there, his sword biting into the Shifter\u2019s side. The wolf didn\u2019t slow. He howled, leapt out of the warehouse, and ran off into the night.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Sean brought the sword up again. \u201cIdiot!\u201d</p><p>He could have meant Liam, the Shifter, or himself. Liam balled his fists as fear poured through him. \u201cBloody hell, he\u2019s going to track her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim. He smelled her on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been wounded by the Guardian\u2019s sword. He won\u2019t get far. We\u2019ll ride after him and finish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot wounded enough.\u201d The feral had seemed unusually strong\u2014he must have been to kill a Shifter female guarding her cubs. Shifter females didn\u2019t go down easily, and one protecting her precious young would fight twice as hard. Liam could taste the feral\u2019s adrenaline spike in the air, a more vicious tang than it should have had. Something was wrong with him that sharply ramped up Liam\u2019s fear.</p><p>Liam started swiftly out of the warehouse, running by the time he hit the weed-infested parking lot.</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d Sean sprinted after him. \u201cIf he makes it, he\u2019ll track the scent back to Shiftertown first, and Dad will make short work of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if he\u2019s as good as I think he is. He\u2019ll track both my scent and hers. Kim took that double-scent home with her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He started the bike, and as soon as Sean leapt on he roared away. Sean might be right, and the feral Shifter might go nowhere near Kim, but Liam couldn\u2019t take that chance.</p><p>Liam raced the bike back down the highway to the city, then north on the freeway. He dove off and angled west, through the main city, circling fine homes that clung to the hillside above the river. The night was hot and dank, but the air rushing past the bike felt chilled.</p><p>He thought of the red dot on the computer map that indicated Kim\u2019s house. To him, the red dot was a target, an announcement of her vulnerability. He needed to warn her, protect her, hold her, taste her...</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t too late.</p> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>A muffled tinkle of broken glass trickled from the kitchen downstairs. At first Kim rolled over in bed, not paying attention. This was a safe neighborhood, never any break-ins.</p><p>When hinges of the kitchen door squeaked, she sat up straight.</p><p>Kim hadn\u2019t been asleep. She\u2019d been staring at the dark ceiling for the last hour, absorbed in thoughts of Liam. How his warm, friendly voice tickled her ear, how the corners of his eyes crinkled when he smiled, how nice his butt looked in those tight jeans. Now her heart pounded, adrenaline pumping as she heard someone moving around her kitchen.</p><p>Should she trust her martial arts classes? In her baby-doll nightie?</p> <p>Screw that. The magic numbers were 911.</p><p>Kim lifted her cell phone from the nightstand, thumb reaching for the numbers. She smelled a sudden sour odor, and then the phone flew across the room and shattered against the wall.</p><p>Before she could scream, strong hands lifted her by the neck. Kim found herself staring into white-blue eyes in a hard male face that had half changed to a wolfish form. Lips lifted from pointed canines, and the breath that washed over her smelled like rotten meat. Kim fought frantically as the half-shifted man\u2019s hands cut off her air, claws raking hot pain. He was going to kill her. Through her dimming vision she realized that this Shifter wore no Collar.</p><p>Then suddenly she was free. Kim crashed back into the bed, gasping for breath, as the Shifter was ripped from her. She dragged her hair out of her face in time to see a wildcat slam the Shifter to her bedroom floor. Snarling filled the room, not angry doggy snarling, but the real thing, wild animals in red-hot fury.</p><p>Sean Morrissey stood inside Kim\u2019s bedroom doorway, holding a broadsword that gleamed with light of its own. Sean\u2019s eyes were midnight dark and full of rage. His gaze fixed on the fight in the middle of the floor, but he didn\u2019t rush to interfere. He watched, waiting.</p><p>The creatures upended Kim\u2019s dresser and nightstand and shoved her bed across the room like it was a cardboard box. Sean didn\u2019t do anything, just stood there with the sword ready. Kim heard herself shouting, but her words were lost in the animal screams as the two creatures fought.</p> <p>The wildcat\u2014ears back, canines extended\u2014snapped its jaw across the wolf\u2019s throat. The wolf yelped once. Its paws scrabbled hard against the wildcat\u2019s body, drawing blood, before the wolf\u2019s head lolled to the side and it fell to the carpet, lifeless. The wildcat sat back, sides heaving, watching the corpse as though expecting it to get up again.</p><p>Kim fought the urge to laugh hysterically. Excuse me but there\u2019s a deceased wolf and a wildcat in my bedroom! She wasn\u2019t certain what kind of wildcat it was\u2014tawny like a cougar, muscled like a leopard, with a hint of stripe like a tiger. It also had the huge jaws and massive paws of a male lion. But the cat didn\u2019t look weird, like a mishmash. It was lithe, beautiful, powerful.</p><p>Sean finally moved. The wildcat backed off as Sean raised the sword, then drove its point into the dead wolf\u2019s chest. The wolf shimmered, became the half-shifted man who\u2019d attacked Kim, then slowly disintegrated to ash. At the same time, the wildcat rose on its hind feet and flowed back into the form of a very naked Liam Morrissey.</p><p>Mmm, he looks good, the back of Kim\u2019s mind said. Rippling muscles, smooth skin, wiry dark hair spreading across his chest. Tight abdomen, massive thighs, huge...Oh, man.</p><p>As soon as air poured back into Kim\u2019s lungs, screams hurtled out of her mouth. She tried to stop them, but hysterical reaction grabbed her and wrung her in its grip.</p><p>Liam\u2019s big body was next to her on the bed, his hand covering her mouth. \u201cHush, now, love. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Delayed shock. Understandable. I\u2019ll be all right.</p><p>Liam\u2019s hand was warm, somehow comforting, even though he was trying to keep her quiet. After a moment he gave her an inquiring look, and she nodded, indicating she\u2019d finished screaming. Liam lifted his hand away, and Kim dragged in a deep breath, inhaling his heady male scent.</p> <p>\u201cLiam, man, get yourself dressed,\u201d Sean said. \u201cYou\u2019ll scare the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right.\u201d Kim closed her eyes, felt Liam\u2019s bare arms and legs encircling hers. Nope, didn\u2019t bother her at all. She opened her eyes again and looked at Liam. \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe killed him,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWe had no choice. The bastard would have killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what happens to Shifters? They dissolve into dust, like vampires on TV?\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t answer, standing stoically with the sword still pointed at the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Liam eased himself away from Kim. She wanted to reach for him again, have him enclose her back into that so very nice, naked embrace. \u201cOnly the ones Sean runs through with that sword. Sean is our Guardian.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Guardian?\u201d More nonverbal cues flew between the brothers, not telepathy, but body language so subtle she couldn\u2019t catch it all, let alone understand it.</p><p>\u201cA protector,\u201d Liam said. \u201cOf Shiftertown, in this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see a Collar on the Shifter.\u201d Kim shivered suddenly, violently. \u201cI was going to die, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would have killed you. He was feral. That means he was dangerous, to you, to me, to our families. He\u2019d already killed a Shifter female and her children.\u201d</p><p>Kim gaped. \u201cWait, I heard about the Shifter woman dying. I thought she and her kids were killed in a car accident on a back highway in Hill Country. Weren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, lass.\u201d Liam looked so sad. Sean stood apart, incongruous in jeans and T-shirt with the medieval-looking sword. \u201cShe was murdered. Sean and me, we put her body in her car and pushed it into that ditch and set it alight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Kim got off the bed. She realized all she wore was a short, silky baby-doll, and she grabbed for the robe she\u2019d tossed to a chair. \u201cWhy not report the crime and have the Shifter brought in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s our responsibility.\u201d Liam\u2019s gaze took in her body as she hastily shrugged on the robe, but his voice rang with anger. Sean gave a nod of agreement.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Kim said. \u201cShifters live in the human world now\u2014that means human law prevails. You signed the agreement. The Shifter should have been arrested and tried like anyone else, not killed vigilante-style by you and Sean.\u201d</p><p>She ran out of breath. The two men weren\u2019t listening to her but looking at each other, still talking without talking. The weight of the Shifter\u2019s death pressed on the room.</p><p>Finally Sean shook his head and slid his sword into a leather sheath. \u201cYou\u2019re effing crazy, Liam, you know? You do what you have to, I\u2019m reporting in to Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that. Take my bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think I\u2019d be hitching a ride with a sword strapped to my back? I\u2019ll see you at home.\u201d</p><p>With a final scowl, Sean turned and left the room, carrying the sword by its sheathed blade. Kim heard him on the stairs, and then the back door slammed beneath them, shaking the house.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Liam got up, still naked and unembarrassed about it. \u201cGet dressed and go downstairs. I\u2019ll cook you some dinner\u2014you look peaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Shifter\u2014he\u2019s...\u201d Kim swallowed. \u201cAll over my carpet.\u201d Gray dust coated the rug she\u2019d bought at an antique store out in Fredericksburg. \u201cEw.\u201d</p><p>Liam enfolded her in his arms and kissed her neck, his warmth like a blanket on her cold skin. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this, love. Go on downstairs and wait for me.\u201d</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t want to. She wanted to stay here for a while and run her hands along Liam\u2019s broad, strong shoulders. His body was solid and reassuring, and so was his smile. She could stand here in his arms all damned night.</p><p>Liam kissed her neck again. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right. Go on, now.\u201d</p><p>Kim was never sure how she made herself back away, grab her clothes, and scoot across the hall to her guest bedroom to change. As she made her way downstairs, she strained to hear what Liam did in her bedroom, but all was silent.</p><p>Liam found his clothes where he\u2019d thrown them off in Kim\u2019s kitchen and slid them on. His adrenaline was still high, his heart pumping hard and fast. He wanted to run, hunt, grab Kim and have unbridled sex with her. Containing himself wasn\u2019t easy, but his body running so hot would continue to stave off the pain that was coming. And then he\u2019d pay. Damn, would he pay.</p><p>Kim hunched on a sofa on the other side of the breakfast bar. She had no kitchen table and chairs; instead, a couple of stools stood at the counter, and she\u2019d filled the rest of the room with a couch and two comfortable-looking chairs.</p><p>Her loose hair straggled over the blouse she\u2019d put on, her blue eyes enormous as she watched Liam dress. He\u2019d cleaned himself up in her bathroom after he\u2019d vacuumed what was left of the feral Shifter from the rug. The bugger wouldn\u2019t come out all the way out, though.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to send that carpet out for cleaning,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kim whitened. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it for you. It\u2019s my fault the shite came here at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep saying it\u2019s your fault? Not everything is your responsibility. You live in the human world now.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to hold on to what she knew, what she\u2019d been told. Humans liked to comfort themselves like that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility because I let you come to Shiftertown. The feral smelled your scent on me and decided to hurt me by hurting you. That way, even if he died, he\u2019d know I\u2019d be grieving. It\u2019s the feral way\u2014take vengeance on your enemy even while they\u2019re killing you.\u201d Liam shook his head as he moved to the refrigerator. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Shifter move that fast, or be able to track that quickly. There was something wrong with him.\u201d</p><p>That bothered him more than he cared to admit. Ferals, ironically, were weaker than Shifters with Collars, because Collared Shifters were well fed, well rested, and had plenty of time to exercise. But this feral had been fast and had brushed off Sean\u2019s first sword thrust as though it were an insect bite.</p><p>Kim shivered. \u201cAre there any more of them out there?\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t know, and that bothered him more than he cared to let on, but he made his tone reassuring. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be. We keep track of the ferals pretty well.\u201d Or so Fergus claimed. The refrigerator\u2019s shelves were bare except for a few containers of yogurt and a rubber-banded bunch of greens. \u201cYou have no food, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the freezer.\u201d</p><p>That compartment revealed stacks of boxed frozen meals, all with \u201cLite\u201d or \u201cLow-calorie\u201d written on them. \u201cThis isn\u2019t food,\u201d Liam said. \u201cIt\u2019s a travesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to watch my weight.\u201d</p><p>Liam remembered how Kim had looked in her wisp of a nightie\u2014lovely br**sts, sweet waist, and thighs he wanted to lick. \u201cI don\u2019t mind watching it for you, love. There\u2019s nothing wrong with your body.\u201d</p><p>She went a deep shade of red, and Liam slammed the freezer door. \u201cI can\u2019t cook you up my famous mile-high pancakes with this crap. Come on. I\u2019ll take you out for some real food.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t go anywhere. My back door is broken.\u201d</p><p>Two small panes had been smashed, the lock ripped out. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that.\u201d</p><p>Liam unhooked his cell phone and made some calls. Voices on the other end promised to come and replace the glass and fix the lock in half an hour. \u201cDoes the human woman have any beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring your own,\u201d Liam growled and clicked off the phone.</p> <p>Kim had a stunned look on her face. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you, sweetheart, it\u2019s my fault the bastard attacked you. I have friends who will take care of things, as a favor to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifter friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other kind? Come on, we\u2019ll leave them to it.\u201d</p><p>Liam somehow convinced her to walk out of the house and open the garage, but he took the car keys from Kim\u2019s shaking hands and drove her back to Shiftertown himself.</p> <p>Sean was right, Liam was effing crazy, but he had to do this. Kim needed protecting, but then, so did the Shifters. Liam would have to combine the two needs. Dylan would be livid, but Liam also had the feeling that Dylan would understand. Fergus, now...Well, Liam would deal with Fergus when he had to.</p><p>\u201cThis is where you work,\u201d Kim said, as Liam parked behind the bar in the tiny space reserved for him.</p><p>\u201cWell spotted, love. They do a mean chicken-fried steak.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s eyes flared with sudden hunger. Did she starve herself, the little sweetheart? She had a man, she\u2019d said. Why didn\u2019t the idiot take care of her?</p><p>The bar was full when they walked in. Shifters predominated the crowd, with a handful of humans who\u2019d either become friends with Shifters, had come in to gawk, or were Shifter groupies. Most patrons hovered at the long wraparound bar, but Liam guided Kim to an empty booth and sat her down.</p><p>Liam\u2019s heart was thumping, his adrenaline still high. He\u2019d have to endure the agony sooner or later, but he hoped it held off long enough for him to enjoy his meal.</p> <p>\u201cTwo chicken-fried steaks, Annie, and a mess of chips.\u201d</p><p>The tall, svelte Shifter woman who\u2019d come to wait on them rolled her eyes. \u201cWe call them french fries over here, Liam. I tell you all the time. Not chips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anyone French in this bar,\u201d Liam said, continuing the usual banter between himself and Annie.</p><p>\u201cThe new cook is Cajun. Close enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll need something to drink,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWhat will you have, Kim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite wine?\u201d</p><p>White wine. She was precious. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to drink the wine here. Bring me a pint of plain, Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuinness,\u201d Annie said, noting it on her pad. \u201cFor you, miss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA Tecate,\u201d Kim said. She glared at Liam. \u201cWith a lime, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Annie whisked away, her tight barmaid shorts clinging to her trim behind. Every male in the bar turned to watch her pass, but once she\u2019d gone their gazes swiveled back to Kim.</p><p>\u201cWhy is everyone staring at me?\u201d Kim whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not the only human here.\u201d</p><p>But she was the only one scent-marked. Every Shifter, male and female, had caught what Liam had done. Nostrils widened, eyes flickered in acknowledgment. Kim belonged to Liam, and anyone who bothered her would answer to Liam. Message sent and received.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking after you, and they know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to come here? We passed two IHOPs on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safer.\u201d</p><p>Kim glanced around. \u201cFor you or for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor both of us.\u201d</p><p>He quieted as Annie set down one sweating bottle of Guinness and one of Tecate, lime firmly wedged into the opening.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to explain why you didn\u2019t call the police on that Shifter?\u201d Kim shoved her lime entirely into the liquid and lifted the bottle to drink. Her tongue came out and touched the bottle\u2019s opening before her lips closed around it.</p><p>Goddess help me, it\u2019s hot in here.</p><p>Liam clenched his beer bottle, but the cold bite on his palm did nothing to calm him. \u201cWhat do you think would happen if your human police found out he was on the loose?\u201d he asked. \u201cShifters would be hunted, and the hunters not too worried about whether they brought down a Collared Shifter or a feral. Just so long as they got one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I can see that. With one Shifter already on trial, people would freak if another one went crazy.\u201d Kim leaned forward, letting Liam see that this blouse didn\u2019t stay fastened any better than the last one had. \u201cDo you think he killed the girl Brian is supposed to have murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it could be that easy. We weren\u2019t aware of him until a few nights ago, when he killed the Shifter woman. He wasn\u2019t around before that. Brian\u2019s girlfriend died months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he wasn\u2019t here?\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cOf course, you\u2019d have remembered smelling him.\u201d</p><p>Liam acknowledged that with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean by \u2018Collared Shifters\u2019?\u201d Kim went on. \u201cSounds like collard greens. Before tonight, I thought all Shifters wore Collars. It\u2019s the law.\u201d</p><p>This was getting complicated. Liam sifted through what was safe to tell her. Hell, none of this was safe. \u201cNot all Shifters took the Collar. Your human government knows that, but they keep it to themselves.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s slim fingers toyed with her beer bottle, but she didn\u2019t drink again. She watched him with intelligent eyes. Beautiful eyes. Damn, it\u2019s been way too long...</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like wearing the Collar is a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, love,\u201d Liam said. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice we were given twenty years ago, and we made it. Most of us. Some Shifters chose to remain wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunted. Dying. Pushed out. We might have survived maybe five more years if we hadn\u2019t taken the Collars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you chose subjugation to save yourselves?\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged, pretending to agree. \u201cOur lines were dying out. We weren\u2019t fertile, and children that managed to get born often didn\u2019t last their first year. Now look at us.\u201d</p><p>Kim moved her gaze from him to the filled room. At the bar Jordie Ross stood with his four sons, all tall and bulky, talking and laughing loudly. Their mother had survived their births\u2014she was sitting in a booth on the other side of the room with a couple of friends.</p><p>Another Shifter woman held her hand on her swelling belly while her husband kept a protective arm around her. She was prudently drinking bottled water, leaning back against her husband.</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d A tall figure cut his vision. \u201cNice human you\u2019ve got there.\u201d</p><p>Liam looked up and scowled. \u201cEllison. Get lost, man. I\u2019m trying to convince her that Shifters are civilized.\u201d</p><p>The tall man laughed. As usual, Ellison wore a black button-up shirt and jeans, cowboy boots, and big hat. He loved Texas, had adopted the state when his Shifter clan relocated from Colorado. Some of his clan missed the cool air of the Rockies, but Ellison Rowe embraced Texas Hill Country, even with its humidity, mosquitoes, bad traffic, and state congressmen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe him.\u201d Ellison thunked into the booth next to Liam and smiled at Kim. \u201cLiam doesn\u2019t have a civilized bone in his body.\u201d Even Ellison\u2019s grin was wolfish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s comforted, hearing that from a Lupine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLupine?\u201d Kim wrinkled her brow. \u201cI heard you say that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans I\u2019m a wolf, baby,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cNot a pu**ycat.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s eyes took on a touch of fear. Liam reached across and touched her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. He\u2019s a good wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell her that. I\u2019m the Big, Bad Wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the feral Shifter,\u201d Kim said softly.</p><p>Ellison instantly lost his grin. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Liam shot Kim a warning look. \u201cA rogue. I took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a wolf? Damn. I\u2019m sorry, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I took care of it.\u201d</p><p>Ellison frowned, his big body folding in on itself, his sunny nature dimming.</p><p>\u201cTwo chicken-fried steaks, extra gravy,\u201d Annie said, depositing the food in front of them. \u201cAnd a mess of fries. Anything else you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me a beer, honey.\u201d Ellison glanced at Kim\u2019s and Liam\u2019s bottles. \u201cA good old-fashioned American beer, nothing Irish, Mexican, or German.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got some strawberry blonde ale in the back,\u201d Annie said. \u201cMade right here in Austin.\u201d</p><p>She swished away before Ellison could protest. \u201cAw, I hate microbrew. Yuppie beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t invite you to the annual microbrew tasting party,\u201d Kim said, as Liam munched a crispy, hot chip. They were chips, damn it. What ass**le came up with french fries? \u201cBrewers from around the county set up booths and give free tastings all day long. You have to be invited, but I\u2019m allowed to bring guests.\u201d</p><p>Ellison\u2019s face fell. \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s not so bad. Some of these brews are downright good.\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed at him, but his heart warmed. Kim was no wilting flower. She was scared, angry, uncertain, and unhappy, but she wasn\u2019t going to hunch in on herself and cry.</p><p>Good. She needed to be strong to take Shifters. She\u2019d have to take the lot of them, now, because she wouldn\u2019t be going home tonight.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Kim ate hungrily. Getting attacked and watching her attacker die did that to a girl.</p><p>This was all so weird. The cowboy sitting next to Liam, sipping his pale beer while watching Liam put away his chicken-fried steak, made jokes, but his eyes were wary, watchful\u2014going from dark blue to light and back again as he and Liam talked.</p><p>Ellison seemed very upset that the feral had been a wolf Shifter. Why? Because Liam and Sean, who\u2019d killed him, were big cats? Kim didn\u2019t understand what difference that made. A Shifter was a Shifter. Wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>Kim sensed that she\u2019d stumbled upon something with layers and layers of complexity. She\u2019d been so confident she could help Brian, striking a blow for Shifter rights at the same time, but now she wondered at her ego. The more she\u2019d learned about Shifters today, the more she realized how very little she knew.</p><p>Ellison eventually moved off to talk to others, taking his microbrew with him. Kim wiped her mouth with the extra napkins Annie had brought. \u201cThank you. I guess I needed the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good meal with a good friend is one of the joys of life,\u201d Liam said, sounding like he meant it. \u201cEven if it\u2019s in a Shifter bar.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s chest felt suddenly hollow. She yearned for this kind of simplicity, but her life was chaotic and stressful and so damned busy. How long had it been since she and her girlfriends had met for a meal, to talk and catch up? To laugh and wallow in memories of friendship? Too long. One of them had moved out of state since the last time the group had met, and the others were caught up in their own lives. Kim hadn\u2019t talked to most of her friends for more than a minute in months. Silas was the only exception and that was only because of his interest in Brian\u2019s case for his documentary. But even his e-mails were brief.</p><p>She put down her fork. \u201cI really should get back home. Your friends have probably repaired my door by now, and I have to work tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working on a Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work at home, but I have a lot to do. Cases to prepare, appeals to file. Brian\u2019s only one of my responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>Liam piled his silverware on his plate, pushed his plate and hers aside, and clasped Kim\u2019s hands. His movements were jerky, and his skin was hot. \u201cYou need to come home with me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Not that, with his hands warm on hers and his sexy blue eyes gazing at her, she wanted to argue much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSean will have told Dad what happened, but Dad will want to hear your side of the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy side of the story? I don\u2019t have a side. I saw what you saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a Shifter problem. Dad needs all the information he can get.\u201d</p><p>Kim let herself squeeze his hands in return. \u201cAll right, but not for long. I really have work to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDance first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>The jukebox was going full blast, some country music tune Ellison had keyed in. \u201cI need to work off some energy. Are you too much of a city girl that you can\u2019t do a Texas two-step?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Irish,\u201d she said as he pulled her up. \u201cDon\u2019t you\u2014you know, jig?\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed, a sound so warm that everyone around them who heard it smiled. His eyes crinkled, and his laugh drove out the lingering horror of the wolf Shifter\u2019s attack.</p> <p>Something should bother Kim about what had happened\u2014something more than dead Shifter wolf and Sean with his sword and Liam being a snarling wildcat, that is. She needed time to sit, think, let her adrenaline shut down while her brain took over.</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t want to let her shut down. He pulled her out of the booth and to the middle of the floor. Other couples were already dancing\u2014very close\u2014but they were Shifters, so Kim couldn\u2019t tell the difference between couples who were lovers and those who were friends. Shifters liked to touch.</p><p>Liam pulled Kim into an embrace, his feet finding the rhythm of the dance. Kim knew the steps, but she hadn\u2019t danced in a long time, and she moved stiffly.</p><p>Liam ran his hand along the curve of her waist. \u201cRelax, darling. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s eyes were so blue, Liam thought. If he were into poetry, he\u2019d say blue like an Irish sea. But he hadn\u2019t seen Ireland in such a long time that he couldn\u2019t be sure if the waters around it were still so pure blue they would break your heart.</p><p>Kim set his already pounding heart to racing. Her lips were red, full, luscious. Liam didn\u2019t kiss\u2014when he bedded women he was too busy to do any kissing, and besides, he and the female were usually in animal form. But touching Kim\u2019s lips with his suddenly seemed like a good idea.</p> <p>His libido was getting ahead of his brains. This woman wasn\u2019t, and could never be, for Liam. She was here temporarily, dragged into Shifter troubles she didn\u2019t understand. She didn\u2019t understand how deeply she was in them, either. When she figured it out, she\u2019d sure as hell not be in the mood for any kissing.</p><p>His libido told his brains to shut the hell up. Her scent was exciting, sweet. She looked up at him and smiled, and her small hands moved to his waist.</p><p>Warm supple woman slid against his body, and Liam\u2019s blood flowed toward his groin. He imagined her under him, hips lifting as he slid into her. Her blue eyes would close, her round br**sts would press his chest, and her legs would rise to twine his waist.</p><p>Gods, he needed sex. After a fight he always ran in his cat form to get it out of his system, before he paid the price. He hadn\u2019t had the chance to run tonight, so his body urged him to do an even better thing, take this woman home and love her.</p><p>If he\u2019d been doing what Sean suggested, having a good night\u2019s shag with a Shifter woman every night, Liam wouldn\u2019t be sweating now, fighting his urges and his Collar. He\u2019d never, ever had urges to be with a human woman.</p><p>Then again, he\u2019d never met Kim.</p><p>Liam pulled her closer, hands moving to her hips. I\u2019m the Shifter who doesn\u2019t need anyone, who puts the good of Shiftertown before everything else.</p><p>Right.</p> <p>Kim laughed. \u201cI forgot how much I liked to dance,\u201d she said over the music.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t your man ever take you out on the town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbel? We go to fancy dinners, usually with a group of lawyers he\u2019s trying to impress. No dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Abel, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Abel Kane. Can you believe his parents named him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could change it. I hear humans do that.\u201d As though a name were a mutable thing. Humans were crazy.</p><p>\u201cHe says people remember it,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI guess he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t dance.\u201d</p><p>Kim laughed. Apparently thinking of this boyfriend dancing was hilarious. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t dance. I didn\u2019t know Shifters did, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do a lot of things.\u201d Liam twirled her once, pulled her against him again, and then the song drew to a close.</p><p>Couples dispersed. Jordie Ross kissed his wife on her upturned lips, stroking his fingers over her throat. The fond look she gave Jordie as she walked back to her girlfriends stabbed through Liam\u2019s heart. His own parents had looked at each other like that once. So had Kenny and Sinead. Mates for life, they\u2019d thought.</p><p>Liam kept hold of Kim\u2019s hand. \u201cTime to go.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s wariness returned as he led her out of the bar. \u201cGo where?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean your home.\u201d And his father. Would Liam\u2019s dad be elderly and kind, with the same blue eyes as his son and a warm smile, or a rigid patriarch who terrified every person who crossed the threshold?</p><p>Liam nodded silently, his eyes giving nothing away. His sudden quietness made Kim nervous, but then she thought about her own house waiting for her, how large and lonely it was.</p><p>The place had never warmed up again since Mark\u2019s death, no matter how hard she and her parents had tried. There\u2019d been a hole in every Christmas celebration, every Easter dinner, every Halloween night\u2019s trek through the neighborhood. The family had gone through the rituals each year, realizing that rituals were unfulfilling when someone you loved was missing from them, but they\u2019d been unable to do anything else. Kim had tried to liven up the house with remodeling a few years ago, having a party to celebrate, but while the house looked more modern, it was still empty.</p><p>Kim thought about Shiftertown, how alive it was, how these people had been forced to reside here but had made it bearable with the closeness of family and friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see where you live,\u201d she decided. \u201cEven if I have to be interrogated by your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t interrogate you.\u201d Liam\u2019s smile returned. \u201cLike Ellison said, we\u2019re pu**ycats.\u201d</p><p>Kim wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that, but she followed him through the crowd that had gathered outside the doors and in the parking lot. They were mostly Shifters, laughing and talking and waiting for a chance to ooze into the packed interior.</p><p>The night had cooled, the humidity lessening. Overhead, stars poked through the lights of the city against vast blackness that stretched to eternity.</p><p>\u201cWhat a nice night,\u201d Kim said. \u201cDo you live far? Can we walk?\u201d</p><p>How weird that she wanted to. In this city of cars, walking was what you did along Lake Austin or in Zilker Park or on Sixth Street on Saturday night. You didn\u2019t walk to actually get somewhere.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not far,\u201d Liam said, \u201cbut we\u2019ll drive. It will be safer to leave your car inside Shiftertown than out here.\u201d</p><p>He had a point\u2014this was a bad part of town. Liam drove again, and Kim was content to look out the window. This late, no kids lingered on the lawns, but the houses glowed with light. People sat out on lit porches to talk or simply watch the night.</p><p>Liam pulled the car into an old-fashioned driveway\u2014two strips of concrete with grass in the middle\u2014about two blocks from where Brian\u2019s mother lived. Liam got out of the car and came around to open the door for her.</p><p>Kim looked up in surprise as Liam helped her out and shut the door, a courtesy she wasn\u2019t used to. In her world, a woman had to pretend she didn\u2019t want or need little courtesies from men. If she wanted a man\u2019s job, she had to act like a man. Be even stronger than a man, actually, and more ruthless. Kim knuckled down and played the game, and she was surprised at how much Liam\u2019s gentlemanly gestures pleased her.</p><p>Liam\u2019s house was a bungalow, like Sandra\u2019s, two stories with square brick pillars on the porch. One corner of the porch held a picnic bench and a table, the other, a porch swing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a porch swing,\u201d Kim said. \u201cStupid, but I was never allowed to have one. Homeowner\u2019s association didn\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to lounge on our porch swing anytime you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone ever tell you you\u2019re a sweetie, Liam? Isn\u2019t it a little late for a visit, though? Will your father be up still?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s smile answered her. \u201cWe\u2019re night people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike vampires? Hell, I\u2019ve had too much beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not like vampires.\u201d Liam opened the front door and ushered her into his house. \u201cVampires are different.\u201d</p><p>Kim wasn\u2019t certain what to make of his answer. Was he teasing? But heck, Shifters existed. Why not vampires?</p><p>She\u2019d definitely had too much beer.</p><p>The front door led straight into the living room, which was dominated by a big box of a television. The couch and chairs had been grouped around it, with folding TV trays for end tables. The tables were littered with soda cans, beer bottles, bowls holding crumbs of corn chips, and stacks of videotapes and DVDs. It looked as though they\u2019d had a movie night. The floors were polished wood with mismatched rugs and runners on them, unlike Kim\u2019s cool tile floors with plush handwoven carpets.</p><p>As Liam led Kim inside, Sean and another man came down the stairs to her left, and a young, lanky Morrissey bounded out of the kitchen that opened beyond the living room.</p><p>\u201cIs that her?\u201d the young man asked.</p><p>The oldest man moved past him and held out his hand to Kim. \u201cI\u2019m Dylan.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s father. He didn\u2019t look any older than forty, but like Sandra, his eyes held the weight of years. Those eyes assessed her, much as Liam\u2019s had, but without the warm interest. His grip was strong, not overpowering, but it let Kim know he could overpower her anytime he wanted to.</p><p>Kim decided that if she\u2019d met Dylan instead of Liam, she\u2019d have hightailed it out of Shiftertown and never looked back. No wonder Liam was the one Brian said everyone approached. You had to be brave to look into Dylan\u2019s eyes and not quail.</p><p>Sean stepped off the stairs. \u201cConnor, why didn\u2019t you clean up this crap? I told you Kim was coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it.\u201d The young man started gathering the jetsam into his big hands.</p><p>\u201cMy nephew, Connor,\u201d Liam said. \u201cOur brother Kenny\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>The brother who\u2019d died. Kim watched the long-limbed Connor shoulder his way into the kitchen, trying to carry everything at once.</p><p>Liam gestured for Kim to sit down. A couch, which had seen years of bouncing children and men\u2019s booted feet, sagged when she sat on it. Connor reappeared and handed Kim a cold soft drink. Kim wasn\u2019t in the mood for one, but she thanked him, opened the can, and took a sip. No reason not to be polite.</p><p>Liam sat down next to her, close, as he had at Sandra\u2019s. Shifters really didn\u2019t understand personal space. Or if they did, they didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Sean stood ill at ease, his hands in his pockets. He wore a frown, as though he didn\u2019t like having Kim there, but not because he didn\u2019t like Kim. Dylan watched also, but with a quietness that the younger men of the family didn\u2019t have. He was closer to the predator than any of them.</p><p>And here I am, the gazelle.</p><p>To calm her nerves, Kim looked around at the d\u00e9cor, which was mostly bachelor clutter. \u201cHey, I have a suitcase just like that.\u201d She pointed at a black bag with metallic studs that stood next to the TV set. \u201cWait a minute, that is my bag.\u201d She glared at Liam, who didn\u2019t look the slightest bit guilt-stricken. \u201cGee, I wonder how it got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember my friends who went to fix your back door? They brought it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kim set her can carefully on a TV tray. \u201cWant to tell me why? Or do you have a fetish about stealing other people\u2019s luggage?\u201d</p><p>It was Dylan who answered. \u201cBecause you\u2019re staying here, Kim. Liam knew you\u2019d want your things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, staying here? Spending the night? I haven\u2019t had that much to drink.\u201d</p><p>Liam slid his arm around her, strong, holding her there. \u201cYou need to stay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Shifter wolf is dead. You and Sean killed him. I\u2019m safe now.\u201d Finally the thing niggling at her broke through the fog in her brain. \u201cLiam, how were you able to kill him? Your Collar should have stopped you from fighting, even against another Shifter. Right?\u201d</p><p>Liam said nothing. She felt Sean standing above her, Connor\u2019s awkward uneasiness, and Dylan\u2019s strong silence.</p><p>\u201cLiam?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes were blue, hard, holding her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p> <p>She took it well. Liam had to give her that.</p><p>No screaming, no outraged swearing, no gibbering in terror. Kim simply looked at him, her eyes unreadable.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked steadily. \u201cIf I can prove that Brian had nothing to do with the murder, it won\u2019t matter whether his Collar can malfunction. I have no reason to share the information far and wide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should let someone else take over Brian\u2019s defense,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>Now the anger came. \u201cOh, no, no, no. This case is going to make my career. Besides, I\u2019m your best hope of springing him.\u201d</p><p>Dylan\u2019s eyes were hard. \u201cBrian understands the need to protect the Shifters.\u201d</p> <p>Kim struggled from Liam\u2019s embrace and sprang to her feet. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019d let him go down? Make him pretend his Collar malfunctioned to keep everyone from knowing the Collars don\u2019t work at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the Collars,\u201d Liam said. \u201cAnd anyway, the Collars do work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. If Brian\u2019s found guilty, he gets the death sentence for Shifters. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t die at the hands of the human government,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cIf he\u2019s convicted, we\u2019ll take care that he doesn\u2019t face an executioner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019ll send Sean to turn him to dust?\u201d</p><p>Sean looked away, unable to meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, not Sean.\u201d Liam stood up beside her. \u201cIt\u2019s not his job.\u201d</p><p>Kim gave him an uncomprehending look; then her eyes widened. \u201cYou mean it\u2019s yours? Oh, Jesus effing Christ, Liam.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Shifter problem,\u201d Dylan said in his quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m a Shifter problem? You can\u2019t take my word that I won\u2019t tell anyone? Liam, you saved my life tonight. I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not up to us,\u201d Sean broke in. \u201cWe don\u2019t make the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe oldest excuse in the book. Aren\u2019t you the leader around here, Dylan? Can\u2019t you make, you know, an executive decision?\u201d</p><p>Dylan shook his head. \u201cThese are clan matters and Shifter secrets. Only Fergus can override the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Fergus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe leader of the South Texas clan,\u201d Liam answered. \u201cDad thinks you should have a hearing with him. I don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Maybe this Fergus will see reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus? Reason?\u201d Liam wanted to laugh. He thought about the big man with the long black braid, the thugs he surrounded himself with. Fergus hadn\u2019t been happy when Kim managed to get Brian a jury trial. He\u2019d wanted Brian to plead guilty and be done, the human prodding into Shifter business over. Liam still didn\u2019t understand why Fergus was so ready to wash his hands of Brian, but Brian had been ready to obey.</p><p>Until Kim had persuaded Brian to fight. Of course she had. Kim was a fighter. Fergus had been livid when he learned Brian had a competent defense attorney.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dangerous, Kim,\u201d Liam said, his voice sharp with worry. \u201cAll Shifters are dangerous, Fergus especially so. You shouldn\u2019t have come to see me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe it to my client to try to help him get free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you know too damned much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it quiet, Liam,\u201d Dylan growled. \u201cI can contain this, but not if the neighbors hear you...\u201d</p><p>Kim looked wildly out the window to the house next door. \u201cWhat? What happens if the neighbors hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might go to Fergus,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe might not be able to stop them. We\u2019re your best protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me here.\u201d She had good lung power for such a small woman.</p><p>\u201cWe can and we will,\u201d Dylan said, eyes glittering. \u201cWe protect the clan.\u201d</p><p>Connor looked distressed. \u201cStop it, Grandda\u2019. You\u2019re scaring her. She\u2019s going to think we\u2019re all crazy.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d not be far from wrong, Liam thought. Kim quivered with rage and fear, and Liam felt the overwhelming need to put his arms around her and soothe her. She needed to be held in the same way he and Sean had held Sandra, calming her nerves, easing her worry.</p><p>Holding Kim would calm Liam as well. His adrenaline was wearing off\u2014he could tell by the dull buzzing in his head. Very soon now, he\u2019d start to pay the price for killing the feral Shifter. Sean didn\u2019t look as bad, but then Sean hadn\u2019t fought; he\u2019d only dispatched the feral\u2019s soul.</p><p>\u201cKeeping you here is the safest thing,\u201d Liam said to Kim. \u201cIf Fergus thinks we have you under control, he won\u2019t send anyone to make sure you are.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s anger would have knocked a weaker man sideways. She\u2019d started to trust Liam, and now she felt betrayed. \u201cUnder control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim, love, when I said I\u2019d protect you, I meant it. That means from everyone, my own father or my clan leader if necessary. If you go home tonight, Fergus will send Shifters after you. I\u2019d have to stay with you, bodyguard you day and night.\u201d Liam ran a finger along her chin. \u201cNot that I\u2019d find that a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>Kim stared at him without softening. He wished he could make her understand that she\u2019d put herself in danger the minute she\u2019d taken Brian\u2019s case. Dylan and Fergus had argued long and hard when Kim had sent word she wanted to talk to Liam, and now Kim was in greater peril than ever.</p><p>Someone banged on the front door, and Liam caught a scent of Lupine overlaid with a large dose of Oscar de la Renta.</p><p>Sean rolled his eyes. \u201cPerfect. She\u2019s all we\u2019re needing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour door\u2019s locked,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice called through the wood.</p><p>\u201cLet her in, Sean,\u201d Dylan said, resigned.</p><p>\u201cAbout time.\u201d A tall woman dressed head to toe in black walked in when Sean opened the door. She wore tight pants and a sleeveless silk shirt and had folded her blonde hair into an intricate French braid. Silver high-heeled sandals studded with rhinestones completed her outfit. \u201cWhy\u2019d you lock the door? You never lock it.\u201d She fixed white-blue eyes on Kim. \u201cWho\u2019s this human woman, and why are you all yelling?\u201d</p><p>The newcomer was lithe, with athletic grace, the kind of female Kim had despised when struggling with teen self-esteem. This Shifter lady could be a model for a fashion doll, except that she exuded personality with a capital P. Even her Collar gleamed.</p><p>Liam, Sean, and Connor viewed her with irritation. Dylan looked downright uncomfortable and avoided her gaze. Interesting.</p><p>The woman put a long-fingered hand on one hip. \u201cI\u2019m getting into bed when I hear my big cat neighbors trying to calm down a shouting woman. What am I supposed to think?\u201d She pinned Kim with her predatory stare. \u201cWhat are you doing to them, honey?\u201d</p><p>Kim looked the woman up and down, pretending she wasn\u2019t unnerved. \u201cThat\u2019s what you wear to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on who\u2019s in it with me.\u201d The woman\u2019s gaze slid sideways to Dylan, who pretended not to notice. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business, Glory,\u201d Connor tried.</p><p>Of all of them, Connor seemed to be the most oblivious to her overt sexuality. But then, if this Glory had something going on with Dylan, his grandfather, Connor would probably think her impossibly old. Even if she looked thirty at most. Damn, Shifters had good genes.</p><p>Glory sniffed the air, nostrils flaring. \u201cLiam\u2019s scent-marked her. I never knew your tastes ran to humans, Liam.\u201d</p><p>Liam slid an arm around Kim\u2019s waist, and Kim wished it didn\u2019t feel so good there. \u201cI\u2019m protecting her from nosy Shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are.\u201d Glory\u2019s light blue gaze moved up and down Kim with too much perception. \u201cBut who protects you from her?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s grip tightened. \u201cGood night, Glory.\u201d</p><p>Glory smiled a knowing smile, her lipstick coral pink. \u201cAll right, I won\u2019t pry.\u201d She gave Kim another assessing look. \u201cBig cats are sensational, sweetie. I keep some extra-large condoms handy if you need them.\u201d She spun on the toes of her shiny shoes and sauntered out, blackclad hips swaying.</p><p>\u201cI can see why you worry about your neighbors,\u201d Kim said as Sean closed the door again. \u201cShe\u2019s really something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory\u2019s a Lupine,\u201d Connor said. \u201cShe\u2019s always giving us grief. Why she wants to live in a big cat neighborhood, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a choice, does she?\u201d Liam looked out the window, probably making sure that Glory went back to her own house and stayed there. \u201cI\u2019m taking Kim up to my room\u2014alone. We need to have a chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your room?\u201d Kim stared. \u201cWhy?\u201d She wished she weren\u2019t so intrigued at the thought. She needed to be afraid of these men, to flee them, to not let them keep her here.</p><p>Then she thought of the feral Shifter in her bedroom and her big empty house with the dusty Shifter remains on her carpet. Contrasted with this bright, warm house, her own place suddenly had too many ghosts.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll sleep up in my room,\u201d Liam was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s the cleanest. I even do hospital corners.\u201d He picked up Kim\u2019s bag, then put his arm around her waist again. He liked doing that, as though she naturally belonged in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. You expect me to stay overnight in a house with four single men?\u201d</p><p>Sean grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re perfect gentlemen, Kim. Everyone knows that. Don\u2019t let us worry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about my reputation, I\u2019m worried about the state of the bathrooms.\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed softly, his warm breath tickling her ear. \u201cThey did a cleanup when I told them you were coming. And if they didn\u2019t, they\u2019ll be doing it now, won\u2019t they? This way, love.\u201d</p><p>Liam took her to a roomy upstairs hall with three bedrooms and bath and a stair that led to an attic. Kim had to admit everything looked nice. Polished wood, freshly painted walls, clean carpets. But the house was definitely missing feminine touches, which made it a little sad and incomplete.</p><p>Liam led her into a large bedroom with only one picture on the wall, a travel poster of a green vista in Ireland.</p><p>\u201cInteresting neighbors you have,\u201d Kim said. \u201cDo she and your dad have something going on? I noticed a lot of tension there.\u201d</p><p>Liam closed the door and dumped Kim\u2019s bag on the floor. \u201cShe and Dad have an on-again, off-again affair. When they get along, it\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when they don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe head for the hills. Right now they\u2019re in neutral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was neutral? I see what you mean about heading for the hills. She\u2019s a wolf Shifter, Connor said, but your dad is a big cat like you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot exactly a match that would have happened before we took the Collar. But they care about each other. Deep down inside.\u201d</p><p>Must be very deep down inside. \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it.\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed his warm, throaty laugh. \u201cI\u2019m skeptical too, love, but it works for them. Come here.\u201d He sat on the bed, putting his back against the headboard, and patted the mattress beside him.</p><p>\u201cOn the bed. Of course.\u201d Kim put her hands on her hips. \u201cIf kidnapping and arguing don\u2019t work, try seduction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo seduction.\u201d How Liam could claim that while looking at her with those sinful baby blues, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Why did no seduction sound so disappointing? Maybe because Kim had felt a tingle of attraction for him since the moment she\u2019d met him? As she\u2019d talked to him throughout the day, she\u2019d been lulled by his deep voice with its Irish lilt, softened by the warm blue of his eyes. Even him turning into a wildcat and killing a wolf on her bedroom floor hadn\u2019t quite brought her to her senses.</p><p>Kim gave up and sat down beside him, stretching her legs out next to his. His hard thigh warmed hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Glory mean when she said you \u2018scent-marked\u2019 me? That sounds disturbing.\u201d Kim didn\u2019t smell anything different about herself, but then she wasn\u2019t a Shifter.</p><p>\u201cProtection, love. Shifters know their families and friends faster by scent first, then sight. I made sure that when they smell you now they smell me and know to leave you alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember you spraying me or anything.\u201d She wrinkled her nose.</p><p>\u201cWhen I hugged you outside Sandra\u2019s house, I let my scent twine with yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She\u2019d remembered that hug all day, his body hard and strong against hers, his arms so comforting. She\u2019d thought it part of the Shifter\u2019s strange need to touch. \u201cBut I went home and took a shower.\u201d</p><p>Liam gave her the smile that made his eyes sparkle. \u201cIt\u2019s more than smell\u2014the scent-mark is a little bit magic as well. It fades with time if you never see the Shifter again, but for now, everyone in Shiftertown knows I\u2019m taking care of you.\u201d</p><p>Kim was uncertain how to feel about that. She didn\u2019t like being \u201cprotected,\u201d but then again, having Liam charge in to save her from the feral had been a good thing. She\u2019d also noted how the Shifters at the bar had sized her up. Without Liam\u2019s mark, would she have been fair game? Unnerving thought.</p><p>Liam had fallen silent, as though lost in thought. His big body took most of the bed, leaving Kim only a tiny portion. She wondered what it would be like to sleep in this small bed with him. A woman would have to cuddle up to him, maybe spoon against his back. Her arm would snake around his waist, and she\u2019d want to tickle his belly button.</p> <p>\u201cDo Shifters have belly buttons?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Liam\u2019s preoccupied look dissolved into a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a treasure, lass. The gods sent you to us, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just occurred to me.\u201d</p><p>Liam eased his T-shirt upward. His jeans rode low on his waist, baring his flat stomach and the indentation of his navel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m human in every way when I\u2019m in this form,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only our appearance that changes. It\u2019s everything. Bones, muscles, organs. It\u2019s hellacious painful when we first do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when you shifted the first time?\u201d Kim couldn\u2019t drag her gaze from his abdomen. She wanted to taste his belly button and slide her tongue down from there to his low-riding waistband.</p><p>\u201cI was about five as humans count years. I was still a cub. I remember thinking I was dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been weird to suddenly be a wildcat\u2014whatever kind of cat you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a Fae-cat. But you\u2019ve got it the other way \u2019round, love. I lived as a wildcat for five years before I shifted to human. Standing up on two feet and having eyes that couldn\u2019t see so well in the dark\u2014it scared the bejesus out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were born a cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were both full-blood Feline Shifters, so yes. When there\u2019s a mix\u2014wolf and cat Shifter, or wolf and bear, say\u2014then you\u2019re born a human babe. You shift to whatever is the dominant gene when you\u2019re about five or six.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. None of her research had told her any of this, which made her realize just how little humans knew about Shifters. \u201cWhat is a Fae-cat, exactly? I couldn\u2019t decide if you were mountain lion or leopard or what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to a non-Shifter. We\u2019re a unique breed, left over from times before humans populated the earth. The Fae made us. They bred in the strengths of all members of the big cat family, at least the big cats of ancient times, the ancestors of wildcats that exist now. We\u2019re fast like cheetahs, can see in the dark like leopards, have the power of lions, the cunning of tigers. That\u2019s why we call ourselves Felines, not a specific breed. The Lupines are wolves, but not exactly like any wolves you\u2019d find in the wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, the best of the entire species.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if you can crossbreed, like you said, then your dad and your next-door neighbor could produce children. In theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn theory, though cross-species fertility is not as high as fertility within a species. Dad\u2019s only about two hundred, so he can still father cubs. Glory won\u2019t tell her age, but she\u2019s still in the fertile range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan is two hundred years old?\u201d Kim asked in amazement. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look much into his forties. How old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born in 1898, as humans count years. Sean came along in 1900.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. \u201cYou look damn good for a centenarian. What about Connor? Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s eighty-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s twenty. Born right after we took the Collar. His mum died of bringing him in, poor lass.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s thought of Connor downstairs, with his good-natured smile and his worry about them frightening her. \u201cOh, Liam, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged, a shrug that meant he\u2019d resigned himself to it. \u201cIt happened often enough when we lived outside of humankind. It\u2019s one of the reasons the clan leaders decided to take the Collar. We were a dying people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was married to the brother you lost, wasn\u2019t she? Kenny? That sucks. Poor Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. A feral got Kenny ten years ago. We\u2019ve looked after Connor, but it\u2019s not the same for him.\u201d</p><p>Kim leaned against Liam\u2019s strong arm, suddenly wanting to comfort him. \u201cAnd I thought I had it bad growing up. But I was always cared for, never had to worry. Even when my parents passed away, they\u2019d taken care of me to the end. I was already working, but they\u2019d left me the house and plenty of money. I never wanted for anything.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth quirked up. \u201cPoor little rich girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt let me do work I believed in. I don\u2019t have to take cases based on how much they pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re free to help hapless Shifters.\u201d</p><p>Kim sat up. \u201cYou all sound like you don\u2019t take this seriously, like you don\u2019t want me to get Brian free. Brian\u2019s mother is barely holding it together. You and Sean had to do the comforting sandwich with her, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Liam went silent. His T-shirt had slid down again, covering his honed body. Damn.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, when I\u2019m defending someone, I make certain he gets a fair trial,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt\u2019s a right we all have that can get lost if we\u2019re not careful. And besides, I think Brian\u2019s innocent. I seem to be the only one who does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim.\u201d Liam cut through her diatribe. \u201cBrian is innocent. He couldn\u2019t have killed that girl. But to prove it, you might reveal secrets that could destroy all Shifters, everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecrets like the fact that the Collars don\u2019t work? Or that some Shifters don\u2019t even wear them?\u201d</p><p>Liam gazed into the distance. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain to me what\u2019s going on.\u201d She softened her tone. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ll do what I can to get Brian exonerated, but bringing down your family isn\u2019t what I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Liam said mildly.</p><p>\u201cSo how is it possible that you killed that Shifter?\u201d Kim asked. \u201cThe Collars really don\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they work, love.\u201d His eyes were clouded. \u201cThey work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I look?\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. Kim knelt back on her heels to examine the thin black and silver chain around his throat. She lifted his hair at the back of his neck, wishing it wasn\u2019t all warm and silky and distracting.</p><p>The chain had no clasp and was fused to his skin, the links snug but not tight. A Celtic knot rested at the base of his throat. When Liam had been in his wildcat form in her bedroom, she\u2019d seen the glint of the Collar against his fur.</p><p>\u201cHow did it not strangle you when you shifted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the Collar goes on, it becomes a part of the Shifter. Don\u2019t ask me to explain the technology or the magic, because I don\u2019t understand it myself. The Collar allows us to change to our animal forms\u2014because if we were denied that we\u2019d die. Our animal form is part of us, with us at all times. So the chain adapts to it.\u201d</p><p>Kim ran her fingers around the Collar, feeling the cool contrast of the silver with his hot skin, the bump of the Celtic knot. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018the magic\u2019? It\u2019s triggered by your adrenal system, isn\u2019t it? To shock you or tranquilize you when your chemical balance changes, right?\u201d</p><p>Liam chuckled. \u201cYou saw me shift from cat to man, and the wolf die away to dust under Sean\u2019s sword, and you still don\u2019t believe in magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. There\u2019s an explanation for even the most bizarre things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me to take you to Ireland someday. I\u2019ll show you magic. An Irishman made these chains, an old man who was permeated with magic himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA leprechaun?\u201d</p><p>Liam laid his head back and laughed. Kim\u2019s hand was still on his neck, and catching his head in her palm felt intimate and warm.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart, no little men in green with shamrocks. The man who made the first Collars was half Fae. Your government\u2014and others in the world where Shifters are allowed to live\u2014agreed that the old mage could supply the chains that keep us weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep talking about Fae. What\u2019s Fae?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes called Fair Folk or fairies, but they\u2019re not cute little people with wings. The Fae are ancient and arrogant beings who once regarded the earth as theirs. Terrifying, they are. They made Shifters to be their pets, their hunting beasts, but we weren\u2019t having any of that.\u201d</p><p>Kim wasn\u2019t certain how much of this she bought, and she couldn\u2019t tell if he believed it himself or was having her on. \u201cYou said the man who made the chains was half Fae. Do you mean he\u2019s dead now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. But he passed the knowledge to his son. The son stays hidden away in Ireland and sends the Collars as they\u2019re needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was it that you could fight and kill the feral Shifter then? Or do the Collars work only if you try to attack humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, like you said, the Collars are keyed to our adrenal systems. Doesn\u2019t matter who we\u2019re violent toward. But some of us have found ways to...delay...the system. It\u2019s painful, but it can be done.\u201d</p><p>Liam met her gaze calmly, but something raged behind his eyes. He\u2019d changed since he\u2019d come into this room, but she couldn\u2019t put her finger on how. \u201cYou\u2019ve learned how to override yours, you mean,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Liam shrugged again, but his shoulders remained hunched. There it was\u2014the key. Instead of Liam the strong and protective, he\u2019d withdrawn into himself. He\u2019d talked with her and smiled at her, but his thoughts were far away.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d he said. \u201cI only override it when necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike tonight.\u201d Kim touched his chest, feeling his heart beating too rapidly beneath her fingers. \u201cAnd that hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did, love. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sitting quietly on this bed and leaving your beautiful self alone. My entire body is brutal raw with pain.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Liam hadn\u2019t lied; he hurt like hell.</p><p>Kim\u2019s eyes went wide with shock. \u201cBut we were dancing half an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hold it off for a long time, especially if the excitement of the kill is high.\u201d He let his gaze drift over her delicious little body. \u201cAnd dancing with you\u2014let\u2019s just say I wasn\u2019t letting anything stop me from enjoying that.\u201d</p><p>She looked worried. \u201cAnd you\u2019re in pain now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcruciating.\u201d Agony bloomed behind Liam\u2019s eyes and in every nerve ending, every muscle. His spine felt as if someone had twisted it with a giant pair of pliers. The punishment didn\u2019t even spare his smallest toes.</p><p>\u201cLiam, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man doesn\u2019t like to admit when he\u2019s hurting. It shames us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do anything for it? Would ibuprofen help? I have some in my purse.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to laugh. Ibuprofen wouldn\u2019t make a dent. \u201cNothing to be done but wait it out. Having you sit here with me is nice.\u201d</p><p>Kim watched him in concern for a few more moments, then snuggled down against him. Liam smiled as he gathered her close, reflecting on the ironies of life. On the one hand, the pain was driving him crazy. On the other, Kim would likely never have draped herself over him if he hadn\u2019t admitted his suffering.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Sean?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs he in pain too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a little, but he didn\u2019t make the kill. He only cleaned up after.\u201d</p><p>Kim smoothed his T-shirt over his abdomen. \u201cWhy would you do this to yourself? I mean all Shifters. Live with the possibility of this hurting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had to.\u201d Liam stopped, talking becoming too much of an effort. The pain would recede, probably by tomorrow morning, but he\u2019d have horror to go through first. It wasn\u2019t so bad this time, maybe because he\u2019d been fighting to protect Kim. He\u2019d acted on instinct when he realized she was in danger, not even worrying about the price he\u2019d pay.</p><p>\u201cYou make me want to kiss you,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>His heart beat faster. \u201cWhat a sweetheart you are. But I don\u2019t kiss.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019ve kissed me plenty today.\u201d</p><p>On her hair, her neck. Liam moved as his c**k started to harden with memory, even through his pain. \u201cI don\u2019t kiss like humans do, on the lips. I don\u2019t see the point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean Shifters don\u2019t kiss at all?\u201d Kim\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWait a minute, I saw a Shifter kiss his wife in the bar. That was his wife, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Jordie? Yes, she was his mate. I didn\u2019t say all Shifters don\u2019t kiss. I said I don\u2019t. When I\u2019m with a Shifter woman we have other things on our minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you hump her without intimacies? Figures. Tragic that someone who looks as good as you isn\u2019t interested in the woman\u2019s pleasure.\u201d</p><p>The pain receded the slightest bit. \u201cWhat shite are you talking? There\u2019s plenty of pleasure when I\u2019m with a woman. On both sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. You don\u2019t even take the time to kiss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re not a Shifter woman, you wouldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s fast and furious, no time for much else.\u201d</p><p>Kim shook her head, her curls tickling through his shirt. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re missing, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with a human.\u201d Liam liked her face close to his, her scent filling his whole body. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Hold still.\u201d</p><p>Kim knelt beside him. Her jeans tightened against her thighs, and her blouse gaped open, giving him a glimpse of soft breast swelling above lace.</p><p>Her scent was driving him crazy. Liam had used protective marking before, but he\u2019d never smelled such a heady mixture as he did now\u2014his scent and Kim\u2019s blended in almost equal parts. As though they belonged together.</p><p>Kim\u2019s hesitant fingertips brushed his cheek, her caress so different from her forthright manner and sassy speech. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>She was worried about him, the sweetheart. \u201cThe pain\u2019s backing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>She came close, closer. The warmth of her skin, the scent of it, made Liam\u2019s hard-on throb, his lust start to break through the excruciating pain. Kim\u2019s lashes swept down as she touched her mouth to his upper lip.</p><p>Something shook in Liam\u2019s core, and the hurting began to lose the battle. Liam moved his lips in response, clumsily catching her mouth with his.</p><p>The satin-smooth slide of Kim\u2019s lips took his breath away. He had kissed in human form before, but they\u2019d been quick, affectionate pecks with friends or female members of the family. He\u2019d never experienced the full sensations of a slow, hot kiss, lips moving and exploring. He cupped Kim\u2019s neck, encouraging her to continue, and nearly jumped off the bed when she thrust her tongue into his mouth.</p><p>Kim jerked away. \u201cWhat? Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Liam laced his fingers behind her neck, under her warm hair. \u201cYou surprised me, is all. Is that your way of kissing? I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy way? I think it\u2019s everybody\u2019s way. Don\u2019t tell me Shifters don\u2019t French kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Irish.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was gorgeous. \u201cWell, well, something I know that the all-powerful Shifter-man doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try it again. I\u2019m a quick learner.\u201d</p><p>Kim cupped his face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. It\u2019s helping me.\u201d Stay with me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get involved with you, and besides, you\u2019re trying to keep me prisoner in your house. Not that you\u2019ll succeed, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for your own safety, love. I\u2019m responsible for what happens to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do feel safer here.\u201d It cost her to admit that, Liam could see. \u201cIf I were alone in my house right now, I\u2019d be scared. Being attacked by that feral\u2014it was so fast. I always thought I could defend myself, and I suddenly realized I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Liam kneaded her neck. \u201cHere you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d He tugged her closer. \u201cLet\u2019s try the French way again.\u201d</p><p>Kim wanted to resist\u2014Liam saw hesitation in her eyes. She wanted to say no, to pull away, to walk out. He also sensed her wanting. She craved to be touched, and she thought he was harmless, sitting here in so much pain it made his teeth ache. Never mind that she was mostly right.</p><p>Kim closed her eyes before their lips met again. Was this required for a kiss? Liam kept his eyes open, liking to watch the way her lashes curled against her skin, how one lock of her hair slid over her cheek.</p><p>She put her tongue inside his mouth again. Liam caught it, licking, lapping, playing. He tilted his head so he could better fit their mouths together.</p><p>Damn, this was good. Humans had something going with this kissing, even if they gave it a French name, like the fries he insisted on calling chips. Liam\u2019s erection was getting massive now. He wasn\u2019t sure whether he\u2019d be embarrassed if the tip peeped above the waistband, or whether he\u2019d be pleased to show her how much he wanted her.</p><p>Playing catch-me with Kim\u2019s tongue, Liam slid his hands to her thighs, wishing she still wore the skirt from this morning. If so, he could inch his way under the hem, latch his fingers over the tops of her stockings, unhook the garters, peel the stockings down...</p><p>Kim eased back, her eyes half closed. \u201cLiam, you\u2019re going to kiss my lips raw.\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling so much better.\u201d Liam dug his fingers into the denim covering her thighs, his strength returning. He could roll her over onto the bed, press her down into the mattress, have her teach him some more about human kissing.</p><p>He touched her lips again. \u201cYou\u2019re a sweet, beautiful thing, do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor an anything, love.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her one more time, then made himself push away and sit up. This was getting dangerous. His strength was growing and with it, rampaging lust.</p><p>Kim looked at him in confusion, her lips swollen and red, her eyes dark, pupils wide. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I thought you wanted more lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid not, sweetheart. I have to get out of here before you regret it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little. \u201cI don\u2019t regret a little kissing.\u201d</p><p>It would be so much more if he didn\u2019t leave. Goddess, she was delectable. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here tonight, I promise you. No one, not even Fergus himself, will get through Dad, me, and Sean. Even Connor\u2019s a good fighter, young as he is. They like you, and we\u2019ve taken you in. You\u2019ll be protected like you were one of the pride.\u201d</p><p>She looked surprised, then thoughtful, as though she hadn\u2019t considered it that way. \u201cI admit I\u2019m afraid to go back home right now. But I can stay only until morning. All right?\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t answer as he stood. He knew damn well she could see his erection\u2014how could she miss a thing of that size pushing at her? If she asked him to, he\u2019d unbutton and unzip to let her see him, or touch him, or take him in her mouth.</p><p>Bloody hell, he had to get out of here.</p><p>Kim wet her lips. Liam put his hands on his hips, his pulse thumping so hard his fingers hurt. Her mouth was lush and red, lips plump, making him want to bite them.</p><p>\u201cI should sleep now,\u201d she said, sounding as though she had to make herself acknowledge it. \u201cI have a lot to do tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Sleep. In his bed, her head on his pillow, her body damp and warm. Maybe wearing that little wisp of a silk thing she\u2019d been in when he\u2019d rescued her tonight.</p><p>\u201cSee you at breakfast then,\u201d he made himself say.</p><p>\u201cWhat do Shifters eat for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWheaties. Or I can fix you my pancakes, like I promised.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t she look mouthwatering, sitting cross-legged on the bed, her blouse half unbuttoned, her ni**les hard enough to press through her bra and the white fabric? He could push her back onto the pillows, close his mouth on one taut point through the shirt.</p><p>Kim picked up a pillow and hugged it to her chest, cutting off the beautiful view. \u201cGood night, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be sleeping much, that\u2019s for certain. Not thinking about you down here in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown here? Where will you be?\u201d</p><p>He pointed at the ceiling. \u201cConnor\u2019s got the whole attic floor. Plenty of room for me to bunk down with him. Want me to knock on the floor, let you know when I\u2019m there?\u201d</p><p>Kim got off the bed, still hugging the pillow. \u201cWhat I want is to sleep and forget about this awful night. Then get up and go home. I don\u2019t mind staying here tonight because I\u2019m scared, but tomorrow, when I\u2019m done being afraid, I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be going home. Liam wouldn\u2019t argue with her right now, though. No point in it.</p><p>He smiled at her, forced himself to turn his back on her compact body and pretty eyes and leave the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had to stand in the hallway a long time after he closed the door, waiting for his fierce hard-on to go down. He needed to talk to Dylan, but he couldn\u2019t face his father with an erection that could stop a train.</p><p>Seeing the light go off under the door behind him and hearing the squeak of his bedsprings as Kim climbed into his bed didn\u2019t help deflate him at all.</p><p>An hour later, Glory opened her back door to admit a moody Dylan Morrissey.</p><p>Glory had never met a Shifter who turned her on faster than Dylan could. So what if he was a Feline? Glory\u2019s friends didn\u2019t approve, but they could eat their hearts out. Dylan was tall, broad-shouldered, and temperamental, with the best ass she\u2019d ever seen on any male, Shifter or human.</p> <p>Glory let Dylan pace, happy he\u2019d responded to the veiled invitation she\u2019d thrown out when she\u2019d talked to the human girl. Dylan didn\u2019t always respond to hints; he did what he pleased. Damned alpha male.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me motion sickness,\u201d she said after a time. \u201cWhat have you decided to do about the little human? Let Fergus kill her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do about her.\u201d Dylan finally stopped and rested his broad fists on her kitchen counter. \u201cLiam just spent an hour talking me out of taking her to Fergus, which means I disobey Fergus\u2019s direct orders. Fuck.\u201d</p><p>If only.</p><p>Glory knew damn well Liam hadn\u2019t talked Dylan out of anything. If Dylan thought the girl should go to Fergus, nothing Liam could do would stop Dylan from taking her there.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think Liam\u2019s right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Dylan\u2019s hard blue eyes sparked with anger, though he flicked his gaze away before his dominant rage could fix on her.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I agree with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you didn\u2019t, you\u2019d have her ass in your truck and be hauling her down to San Antonio instead of standing in my kitchen with me.\u201d</p><p>Dylan slammed his fists into the counter. \u201cI know that. But Liam...\u201d He straightened up and shook his head. Glory glanced quickly at the counter, but Dylan hadn\u2019t dented it. This time.</p><p>\u201cBut Liam what?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cHe cares about her.\u201d Dylan ran his hands through his hair, mussing it in a sexy way. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like this. I thought he wanted to protect her because Liam always protects the weak. But it\u2019s more than that. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s letting her sleep alone tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019ll claim her?\u201d Glory started brewing coffee to cover her nervousness, not to mention her rampaging horniness. \u201cShe\u2019s human.\u201d</p><p>Dylan leaned his backside against the counter and folded his arms. \u201cYou know how high the ratio of males to females is in Shiftertown. It\u2019s doubtful Liam will ever mate with another Shifter.\u201d</p><p>Glory poured fragrant ground coffee into her coffee-maker and closed the lid. \u201cYou\u2019d let him take a human as mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever in the old days, but those days are gone.\u201d He looked exhausted, Dylan who\u2019d lived so long and seen so much. \u201cShe seems robust, and she\u2019s not afraid of us.\u201d</p><p>Glory snorted. \u201cIf she\u2019s not afraid of you, it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t know any better. Though I agree, she\u2019s got spunk.\u201d She admired the way the human girl had said what she\u2019d really thought, though Glory would never admit it. In Glory\u2019s experience, most humans she encountered either avoided eye contact with her, pretended contempt, or simply ran away.</p><p>\u201cAnother reason I don\u2019t think Liam will claim a Shifter woman is because he thinks too much about the good of the clan,\u201d Dylan was saying. \u201cHe pushes potential mates on other Shifters rather than claiming them himself. I asked him why, once. He said that Shifters lower in the hierarchy have more time to breed and raise a family, and that\u2019s what Shifters need most. Cubs, not testosterone contests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow self-sacrificing of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI also think he\u2019s never come across a female who stirs him. For sex, yes. As a mate, no. But this one...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one he\u2019s not likely to charitably pass down to the next mate-seeking Shifter. She\u2019s human; she needs his protection. And Liam is a protector at heart.\u201d Glory smiled. \u201cLike his dad.\u201d</p><p>Dylan finally looked straight at her. He\u2019d been sliding his gaze from hers, trying not to pin her with his angry uncertainty, trying not to demand submission. What a sweetie. He must know that if he wanted Glory to go down on her knees, she\u2019d happily oblige.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d Dylan answered irritably.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s you. You\u2019re one big protecting hunk of male. The only reason Fergus leads your clan and not you is because he\u2019s a ruthless bastard. You don\u2019t challenge him, because you fear he\u2019ll retaliate on the innocent, Connor in particular.\u201d</p><p>Dylan\u2019s expression went harder still, and it was all Glory could do to stay upright in her high-heeled shoes. His eyes were tinged with red, a sign that he was ready to lose it.</p><p>\u201cYou only met Fergus the once,\u201d Dylan said, tight-lipped.</p><p>\u201cOnce was enough. I never want to see him again. People respect you, Dylan. They fear Fergus. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>She started to turn away, but a steel-strong hand clamped her arm. \u201cWhat are you trying to do, Glory? Sow insurrection in my clan?\u201d</p><p>Glory looked at him in surprise. \u201cInsurrection? Are you kidding? What for?\u201d</p><p>Dylan\u2019s grip softened, but Glory saw he had to make himself ease off. \u201cThen why are you so interested in me challenging Fergus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a better man than he is. I\u2019ve always thought that, and I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d</p><p>Dylan closed his eyes. He clenched his jaw, a muscle twitching. \u201cThe clan\u2019s survival is more important than me confronting Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Glory dared to step closer to him, now that his a wful gaze was shielded. \u201cIf we start challenging and fighting one another like we did before the Collar, we\u2019ll be dead within a few short years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, sometimes I listen when you talk.\u201d</p><p>Dylan opened his eyes then, the red gone, the beautiful blue so deep it made her heart ache.</p><p>\u201cGlory,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it.\u201d</p><p>Dylan wove his fingers through her hair, loosening it until it spilled over his hands, and he covered her mouth with his.</p><p>Glory rose into the kiss, excitement pumping through her. No one could screw like Dylan could. And Dylan surpassed even himself when he was pissed off and warring with his dominant instincts.</p><p>She decided not to fight too hard when Dylan lifted her and deposited her on the counter. She wrapped her legs around his hips, unbuttoned his pants, and leaned back to enjoy herself.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Liam was wrenched out of sleep the next morning by Kim banging on the attic door and shouting his name. His instincts had him on his feet and wrenching open the door before his brain even knew he was awake.</p><p>He found Kim in the hall, her eyes blazing, in a big black T-shirt with a Guinness logo on it. Kim had obviously slept in the rumpled T-shirt, which she must have found in Liam\u2019s dresser drawer. Liam knew she\u2019d be warm and very naked beneath it, and then he realized he was naked himself, prepared to shift.</p><p>One part of him was shifting already. \u201cGods, Kim, why are you out here yelling like a banshee?\u201d</p><p>Kim held up a small bit of satin fabric, her eyes wide with fury. \u201cWho packed this? It was a man, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Why?\u201d</p><p>She shook the red satin patch. \u201cThis is a thong. Have you ever worn a thong? Do you know how it feels to have a string up your ass all day?\u201d</p><p>Liam sensed the rest of his family listening: Connor sitting up in bed behind him, Sean in the hall below, Dylan behind him in the same clothes he\u2019d worn last night, which meant he\u2019d slept next door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a thong?\u201d Liam asked her. \u201cI bet it\u2019s sexy on you.\u201d He pictured it, and immediately clamped down on his imagination. Gods.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI\u2019m standing in a courtroom, trying to think on my feet while the prosecution is laughing its butt off at me, but that\u2019s all right\u2014at least my underwear is sexy.\u201d</p><p>Liam leaned on his arm, trying hard not to laugh. He heard Dylan retreat, quietly, into his bedroom. Sean, too, departed, chuckling. Connor folded his arms around his knees, watching this female display in puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have them, then?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cFriends buy them for me, all right?\u201d Kim snapped.</p><p>\u201cAnd you hang on to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt their feelings. They think they\u2019re doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>Liam let his grin break through. \u201cThey think it\u2019s a favor to let you...how did you put it...wear a string up your ass all day?\u201d</p><p>Kim rolled her eyes. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019m taking a shower and going home. You got rid of the feral Shifter, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s coming back. I\u2019ll be perfectly safe.\u201d</p><p>Liam felt Connor\u2019s tension behind him, his troubled worry. Liam relaxed his stance to try to convey to Connor that everything was under control. Right. \u201cKim, love, I\u2019ll make you breakfast, and you write out a list of what you need. I\u2019ll send someone \u2019round to retrieve it all for you. Someone female this time. How will that be with you?\u201d</p><p>Kim planted her fists on her hips. She shouldn\u2019t have done that; the movement thrust out her br**sts and let the T-shirt outline her ni**les. \u201cAre you still insisting that you won\u2019t let me leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly safe. The feral Shifter is dead, and you had the lock on my door fixed. Make your damn pancakes if you want to, and then I\u2019m leaving. I won\u2019t tell anyone what happened last night or repeat what you told me about the Collars. I know how to keep a secret, all right? And you can just get over it.\u201d</p><p>She stomped back down the stairs and slammed her own door so hard the sturdy walls rattled. Liam sensed her beneath the boards at his feet\u2014her rage; her frustration; her warm, pliant body filling out his shirt. Her closed door would be no barrier to him if he chose to charge in and confront her.</p><p>Connor was watching Liam with concern. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>He meant, was Liam going to subdue her, and would he hurt Kim doing it? Connor was young, still uncomfortable with his own instincts, not yet certain where he fit in the clan and pride hierarchies. Things were more difficult for him than they had been for Liam or Sean, because Connor had grown up a captive Shifter, and boundaries were fuzzier now than they\u2019d been in the wild. Connor didn\u2019t yet understand when you showed dominance and when you tolerated, and what you tolerated. Plus, he\u2019d been raised by mateless males and had never seen an example of an intimate relationship.</p><p>Not that anything Liam had with Kim was going to be straightforward. Educational, maybe. Straightforward, no.</p><p>Liam tamped down his own instincts, dousing the pheromones that were putting Connor on edge. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d He shrugged and headed for the attic bathroom. \u201cWhat she asked me to. I\u2019m going to make her pancakes.\u201d</p><p>Kim descended to the kitchen, showered but still irritated. Liam\u2019s friends had packed not only the underwear she never wore, but also her shortest skirts and lowest-cut tops, a garter belt, and a bunch of stockings. Nothing remotely comfortable, not even shorts and sandals for surviving Austin in the summer.</p><p>She paused at the kitchen doorway, surprise cutting through her annoyance. Liam in a tight T-shirt and jeans, spatula in hand, glared at a griddle full of pancakes. Behind him in the narrow kitchen, Sean scrubbed dishes in the sink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Every woman\u2019s dream\u2014two gorgeous men in the kitchen, cooking and cleaning.</p><p>Dylan sat at the table, tipping his chair back on two legs while he watched a sports report on a television that had to be twenty years old. Connor sat next to him, flipping through a car magazine. The air was somewhat tense, as though words had been cut off when they\u2019d heard her coming.</p><p>Something else wasn\u2019t right about this domestic picture, apart from tall, muscular men working in the kitchen to fix her breakfast. Kim realized that Connor didn\u2019t have his nose in the Internet or a video game or a cell phone. Nor did he have an iPod glued to his ears.</p><p>Were those more technologies forbidden to Shifters? Or could the Morrisseys simply not afford them? She knew that Liam had a job, which he seemed to take casually. What about Sean and Dylan? Did they work? They seemed in no hurry to rush to an office. Abel was always out of bed as soon as the alarm went off, through the shower and into his suit and tie in fifteen minutes. \u201cCome on, honey, we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d No time for pancakes, coffee, or a chat, never mind a morning cuddle.</p> <p>Liam took a plate from the stack next to him and flipped pancakes onto it. \u201cThese are done. You\u2019re supposed to have the table ready, Connor.\u201d Liam smiled at Kim, but something in him seemed subdued, the sparkle that had been in his eyes earlier that morning gone. What was going on?</p><p>Connor hauled his tall form out of the chair and shuffled to the kitchen. When his body filled out, he\u2019d be as muscular as his two uncles and Dylan. He looked unfinished right now, like a young horse, all arms and legs. But he was handsome enough, probably already drove girls crazy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Kim offered. She took the bottles of syrup Connor had snatched out of the cupboard and carried them to the table.</p><p>Dylan rose. \u201cSit down, Kim. You\u2019re a guest.\u201d</p><p>Kim opened her mouth to say, No, guests are allowed to leave, but she shut it again. There was plenty of time to argue, and besides, the pancakes smelled terrific.</p> <p>In any case, she had no intention of arguing with them. She\u2019d simply get into her car and leave.</p><p>The pancakes tasted as good as they smelled, tangy, sweet, and laced with cinnamon. Damn Liam for being so gorgeous and skilled at cooking too.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well, Kim?\u201d Connor asked her around a mouthful.</p><p>Kim had fallen into a heavy sleep and dreamed about two things\u2014being attacked by feral Shifters and kissing Liam. Both experiences had been intense.</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam didn\u2019t,\u201d Connor said. \u201cHe thrashed all night. The springs on my extra bed squeak something awful. Drove me mad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t used to the bed,\u201d Liam said, sitting down next to Kim with his pancakes.</p><p>For a man who\u2019d slept restlessly, especially after claiming to be in excruciating pain, Liam looked damn good. His face was freshly shaved, his hair still damp from his shower. She smelled soap and shaving cream on him, which sent her imagination into the shower with him, his body dripping wet and soapy.</p><p>Dylan, on the other hand, looked extremely pissed about something. He glowered as he ate, hunkering over his plate. Sean went through his pancakes quickly, without speaking, and returned to the kitchen for more dish scrubbing.</p><p>\u201cDo you always make Sean do the dishes?\u201d Kim asked. \u201cSeems unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe take it in turns,\u201d Liam answered. \u201cIt\u2019s Sean\u2019s day to do the washing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine tomorrow,\u201d Connor said glumly. \u201cI swear I\u2019m taking a mate as soon as I\u2019m of age, so I don\u2019t have to do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Kim ate her last mouthful of pancakes and wished for more. Screw eating light; these were good. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be your offer, Connor? \u2018Marry me so you can clean up after me, my two uncles, and my grandfather\u2019? I\u2019m sure every woman would jump at that.\u201d</p><p>At the sink, Sean laughed. Liam smiled, but distractedly. Connor frowned as if she\u2019d given him something new to think about, but even his enthusiasm was dampened.</p> <p>The four Morrisseys were certainly wound up this morning. The worst tension was between Liam and Dylan\u2014and Kim gave herself three guesses what they\u2019d been fighting about.</p><p>Kim set down her fork. \u201cLet\u2019s keep this simple. I\u2019m going to go upstairs, get my stuff, and leave. I\u2019ll call you and let you know what\u2019s going on with Brian\u2019s case\u2014keep you in the loop. I promise. And I won\u2019t reveal anything I learned about feral Shifters, Collars, or your werewolf neighbor in glittery shoes.\u201d</p><p>Dylan looked up from his meal, his eyes dark but tinged with red. Despite his handsomeness, he was damn scary, and Kim again realized why humans sought out Liam instead of his father.</p><p>Liam shot Dylan an angry glance, but when Liam spoke to Kim his voice was gentle. \u201cYou need to stay a little longer, love. A few more days at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kim wiped her mouth and put down her napkin. \u201cI have a job and a life. Tomorrow is Monday and I have to be at my office, where I work to earn my living. Remember Brian and his case? You do want me to get him free, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go to your office,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. A Shifter walking the halls at Lowell, Grant, and Steinhurst. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that or you don\u2019t go at all.\u201d</p><p>Kim shoved back her chair and stood up. \u201cListen, Liam, I didn\u2019t ask to be dragged into your problems. I didn\u2019t ask for that\u2014thing\u2014to attack me. I\u2019m real sorry I found out about the Collars, but all I want to do is get Brian released and back home to his mother. You don\u2019t seem to remember that I\u2019m on your side.\u201d</p><p>Liam had gotten to his feet with her. Connor watched, worried, and Sean turned from the sink, scrub brush dripping.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me, Kim,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right it\u2019s not up to you. It\u2019s up to me.\u201d What was the matter with them? \u201cY\u2019all are Shifters. You could be arrested for kidnapping me or holding me hos-tage\u2014hell, for even talking to me sharply. They\u2019ll do to you what they\u2019re doing to Brian. A sham of a trial and an execution.\u201d</p><p>Dylan finally spoke. \u201cWe weren\u2019t planning on telling anyone. Or letting you tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s heart beat faster. Yep, Dylan was the scariest one in this room, all right. Her powers of argument died under his red-tinged stare. The feral Shifter who\u2019d attacked her now seemed like a puppy dog compared to Dylan.</p><p>Liam\u2019s voice went hard. \u201cDad, you promised this was mine to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but you\u2019re not handling it,\u201d Dylan answered. \u201cYou know what you have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me do it then. In my own time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you need to do it now. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>Kim backed up a step. \u201cDo what now?\u201d</p><p>Liam wouldn\u2019t look at her, while Dylan glared and Sean turned away. Connor had his mouth open, clearly not knowing what they were talking about, either.</p><p>\u201cDo what now?\u201d Kim repeated.</p><p>If she ran for the door, would she make it? How fast could Dylan, Liam, and Sean move? Liam didn\u2019t look ready to spring, and neither did Dylan, who sat loosely, but these men weren\u2019t human.</p><p>What was the matter with her? Yesterday, she\u2019d been nervous about coming to Shiftertown and talking to a Shifter who wasn\u2019t behind bars. Then Liam had looked at her with those Irish blue eyes, and she\u2019d melted. She\u2019d even slept in their house without putting up much fuss. She\u2019d done everything on their terms, and Kim never did anything on anyone\u2019s terms but her own.</p><p>Now she was reminded of how dangerous Shifters were. She\u2019d blithely walked into their lives, and she knew they wouldn\u2019t let her blithely walk out again.</p><p>Kim balled her fists. \u201cLiam, please reverse the scent-marking. I don\u2019t do the dominant-submissive thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim.\u201d</p><p>Oh, damn, even him saying her name made her want to flow to his lap and put her arms around him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she growled.</p><p>\u201cThe scent-marking is for protection, not subjugation. Besides, you\u2019re less submissive than the highest alpha female I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. You\u2019re telling me that Glory is submissive?\u201d</p><p>Dylan rumbled, \u201cShe\u2019s not an alpha. She\u2019s fairly far down in her pack.\u201d</p><p>The surprise of that stopped Kim\u2019s speech for a moment. But only a moment. \u201cThat explains why she puts up with you. But not me. I\u2019m out of here. I\u2019m sorry, Liam, but you\u2019re going to have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Liam stepped around her to cut off her retreat. No, she wouldn\u2019t have made it to the door. His hands went to her shoulders, and she found herself pinned against the nearest wall.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to have to trust me,\u201d he said.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t fair. He smelled too good. His blue eyes held the hint of red that Dylan\u2019s did, but she sensed that Liam was holding himself way, way back.</p><p>For one giddy moment she wondered what it would be like if he let loose. Would he press her to the wall, cover her with the weight of his body? Watching him lean around the bedroom door frame this morning, stark naked, had made her br**sts ache and her thighs grow damp.</p><p>I have lost my mind.</p><p>The moment hovered, Liam towering over her, Kim\u2019s knees wanting to bend. She could slide down Liam\u2019s body and press her face to the front of his jeans. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice?</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Connor shouted. He folded over, arms around his stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, Connor?\u201d Kim asked worriedly.</p><p>\u201cNo. Crap.\u201d He moaned in sudden pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you sick? Geez, Liam, what did you put in the pancakes?\u201d</p><p>A plate shattered on the kitchen floor. \u201cShite,\u201d Sean whispered, and at the same time his eyes flooded with pain.</p><p>Liam shoved Kim from him. \u201cKim, get away from us. Now.\u201d</p><p>All four Morrisseys started growling, eyes changing. Connor moaned pathetically.</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t know enough about Shifters to know what the hell was the matter with them. Were they shifting? Or sick? Sean slid to the kitchen floor at the same time Liam fell to his knees. Dylan got out of his chair and tried to go to Connor, but he collapsed before he made it to his grandson.</p><p>Liam raised his head, lips peeling back from fangs. \u201cGo!\u201d he shouted at her. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t waste time arguing. She fled through the kitchen, wrenched open the back door, and ran outside into hot, humid Austin air.</p><p>She could leap into her car, roar the hell out of Shiftertown, go home, and change all the locks. Move. Quit her job, never see Shifters again. They could keep her clothes; she didn\u2019t like most of what they\u2019d packed anyway.</p><p>When she reached the bottom of the porch steps, Connor started screaming. The anguish of it made Kim stop, turn back. Connor was the youngest, the weakest of them, and whatever was happening hurt him most of all.</p><p>Kim ran back up the steps and into the house. Connor\u2019s keening split the air. Dylan and Liam were both crawling toward him, and she realized that they were trying to touch him, these people who comforted each other with bodily contact.</p><p>\u201cLiam, what can I do?\u201d</p><p>Liam cranked his head around and looked up at Kim. His eyes were bright red. \u201cNo, Kim. Get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave you like this. How do I help you?\u201d</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t answer. He managed to reach Connor, who screamed even louder when Liam touched him.</p><p>Damn it. Kim didn\u2019t know enough about Shifters\u2014she who\u2019d thought she\u2019d researched everything about them. This could be anything from their Collars going wrong to some kind of weird virus.</p><p>\u201cHang on. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea if Liam heard or understood. Kim ran out through the kitchen again and headed down the dirt path to the house next door. She banged on the back door, cupping her hands to peer through the window. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGlory?\u201d</p><p>She heard nothing, and for a few seconds she feared that Glory, too, writhed on the floor, moaning. Maybe everyone in Shiftertown did. Shit.</p><p>Glory wrenched open the door, as tall and stunning as she\u2019d been the night before. She wore a hot-pink halter top that clasped her throat and hid her Collar, skin-tight black leather pants, and pink spike-heeled pumps. Not an alpha, my ass.</p><p>Glory was breathing hard, as if she\u2019d been working out, but there wasn\u2019t a drop of perspiration on her face, not a hair out of place. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with them. Something Shifter-wrong. You have to help them.\u201d</p><p>Glory jerked her gaze to the Morrissey house. \u201cWith Dylan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all of them. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Without a word Glory stepped past her and hurried down the porch stairs. Kim had to jog to keep up with the woman\u2019s long stride, and this with Glory wearing mile-high shoes.</p><p>Glory shoved open the back door of the Morrissey house as though she belonged there. She stopped short, and Kim nearly ran into her. Liam had his arms around Connor now, but Connor still keened with his heart-breaking wail.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d Kim shouted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen this before.\u201d</p><p>Fat lot of help that was. Glory strode to Dylan, who had his eyes closed, his now elongated teeth cutting his lips. Glory grabbed his shoulder. \u201cDylan!\u201d</p><p>She had to shake him and yell at him before Dylan finally looked up, his eyes now yellow swimming with red. He rasped a word Kim couldn\u2019t understand, but Glory nodded. She turned back to Kim with a grim look.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re being Summoned,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSummoned? What the hell does that mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt means their clan leader is calling them. He\u2019s put a compulsory spell on them\u2014they\u2019ll be like this until they reach him and he lifts it.\u201d</p><p>A spell? \u201cI thought you said you\u2019d never seen this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t. Summonings happen only about once every two hundred years, because clan leaders who use them indiscriminately don\u2019t stay clan leaders long. Shifters don\u2019t like being coerced. Fergus must want you bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, he couldn\u2019t use the phone like everyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did use the phone. Yesterday. He commanded Dylan to turn you over to him, and Dylan refused. So Fergus did this.\u201d</p><p>From Glory\u2019s expression, she fully blamed Kim. Glory\u2019s shirt might hide her Collar, and Dylan might claim she wasn\u2019t high in her pack, but she was still a Shifter, still strong, still deadly.</p><p>\u201cYou have to get them to San Antonio,\u201d Glory said.</p><p>\u201cSan Antonio?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where Fergus is. You have to get them to Fergus\u2014they can\u2019t drive like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo this Fergus who\u2019s demanding that I be \u2018turned over\u2019 to him, whatever the hell that means? Why can\u2019t you take them?\u201d</p><p>Glory snorted. \u201cRespond to a Summoning from another clan leader? I\u2019m Lupine. I walk into a gathering of Felines, they\u2019ll take my head off before I can speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to risk it. Fergus will expect you to come with them anyway. Come on, help me get them into your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t fit in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake them fit.\u201d Glory grabbed Dylan under the armpits and hauled him to his feet. The big man could barely stand, but he leaned heavily on Glory and let her drag him across the kitchen. \u201cThere\u2019s no other choice.\u201d</p><p>Glory kicked open the kitchen door. It banged against the wall and began to drift shut, small flakes of plaster floating from the ceiling.</p><p>Liam snaked one clawed hand around Kim\u2019s ankle. \u201cNo,\u201d he rasped. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>The pain in his eyes broke her heart. Liam was right; she should run. She should leave the Shifters to their fate and emigrate to Australia. Kim was coldly terrified at the thought of facing this Fergus, the man who could render four powerful Shifters helpless from seventy-five miles away. But Liam\u2019s anguish kept her with him.</p><p>\u201cKim,\u201d Glory shouted. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Kim leaned over Liam. \u201cWe have to go, Liam. It\u2019s the only way, Glory says.\u201d</p><p>Liam tried to speak, but his words came out as unintelligible grunts.</p><p>Glory charged back inside and grabbed Sean. Kim finally persuaded Liam off the floor, and Liam hauled Connor to his feet. Somehow, the three of them got out the door and to Kim\u2019s two-door Mustang.</p><p>Sean had already folded himself into the tiny backseat, while Dylan leaned heavily on the car. Dylan seemed the least debilitated, but he was older, probably stronger. Glory took charge of Connor, and Dylan helped her slide Connor into the back next to Sean. Dylan himself cramped in beside his grandson, leaving the front seat for Liam to collapse into.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d A male Texan voice reached Kim. The big Lupine she\u2019d met the night before, Ellison, came running at them from across the street. \u201cGlory, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummoning,\u201d Glory said tersely.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim\u2019s taking them to Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man.\u201d Ellison\u2019s light blue eyes filled with distress. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t go with you, damn it. Liam\u2019s got my cell number. You call me and keep me posted, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Kim numbly got into the car.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Ellison dashed into the Morrissey house, then out again, carrying Sean\u2019s big sword in its leather sheath. \u201cTake this, in case.\u201d</p><p>There was no room for it in the packed car. Kim opened the trunk and Ellison dropped it inside.</p><p>As Kim slammed her door and started the car, Ellison stepped close to Glory and put both arms around her. She leaned into him, not in a sexual way, Kim realized, but for comfort, like Sandra had with Sean and Liam yesterday.</p><p>Kim pulled out of the driveway, her fingers cold and shaking despite the July heat, and headed out of Shiftertown.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>They\u2019d better be grateful for this. Kim sped down the I-35 as fast as she dared, cursing under her breath at the crawling traffic. It was Sunday\u2014shouldn\u2019t all these people be in church or something? But no, they were meandering along the freeway between Austin and San Antonio, clogging the ramps, driving slowly in the left lanes, cutting her off...</p><p>She drove as swiftly as she was able, though she didn\u2019t dare risk being pulled over for speeding. She imagined herself trying to explain to the nice police officer why she had four half-crazed Shifters stuffed into her car and a big sword in the trunk.</p><p>Connor\u2019s moans had turned to whimpers. Kim had no idea how this Fergus had caused their state from so far away, but she wanted to scream at him. Liam was the strongest man she\u2019d ever met, and to see him hunched up in the seat next to her, rocking in pain, made her furious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much farther.\u201d She had no idea if Liam could hear her, and he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>The freeway had never seemed so long. Signboards with German-sounding names slid by: New Braunfels, Gruene, the ever-popular Schlitterbahn water park, which Kim had loved as a kid.</p><p>When they reached the northern outskirts of San Antonio, Liam at last took his hands from his face. \u201cThis exit.\u201d</p><p>Kim dove for the off-ramp, which took her to a freeway that looped around the city. \u201cThen where?\u201d</p><p>Liam flicked his fingers at the road, which she took to mean, \u201cKeep going.\u201d Dylan sat up behind her. In the rearview mirror, Kim saw him draw Connor to him, cradling the boy against his chest. Sean had his eyes closed, but Kim couldn\u2019t tell whether he slept.</p><p>When they\u2019d reached the southwestern edge of town, Liam gestured for Kim to take another exit. He directed her down a road that became a highway, running west out of town again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Shiftertown out here?\u201d Kim asked, as they left the city limits behind.</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t answer. Sean was sitting up now, leaning against the window. Their breathing had calmed, no longer tortured rasping, but they still looked gray and drawn.</p><p>About twenty-five miles later, Dylan leaned forward between the seats, long arm pointing out a side road that wasn\u2019t signposted. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d left Hill Country behind and had reached the deserts of south Texas. The land was flat and dry, grasses clumped and yellow instead of soft green. On the left side of the road, behind barbed wire, a few cows grazed.</p><p>No barbed wire lined the right side of the road, the land open and flowing to the white-blue horizon. The humidity had dropped considerably, Kim\u2019s sweat was quickly evaporating in the dry air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming up,\u201d Liam said. He sounded almost normal, and his fangs had receded.</p><p>Two wooden fence posts with no fence and no gate marked a dirt road that reached a pale finger across the land. Kim turned down it, silently cursing the ruts that banged her car\u2019s underbody. Maybe she could charge this Fergus for the damage.</p><p>A cluster of houses lay about three miles down this joke of a road, and a hand-painted sign read: WELCOME TO SHIFTERTOWN! POPULATION: FIFTY-TWO SHIFTERS, TWENTY HORSES, FIVE DOGS, AND FIFTEEN CATS.</p><p>The houses were long, low adobes with tiny windows, probably ranch houses left over from earlier in the twentieth century. Like the houses in Austin, these had been fixed up and painted, but instead of having yards, they were grouped around a somewhat sad playground where no kids played. Pickups were parked haphazardly in the dirt around the houses.</p><p>A steel pole corral that surrounded open stalls with corrugated steel roofs sat at one end of the street. A dozen desultory horses moved between pens and corral, paying no attention to the car hurtling toward them in a cloud of dust.</p><p>One of the town\u2019s five dogs lounged at the front door of the house in front of which Liam told Kim to park. The house was no bigger than the others and had a green-painted door flanked by two windows to either side of it. The dog got up, stretched, and wandered toward them, tail wagging.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is right?\u201d Kim asked, as she got out and yanked the seat forward to release the others.</p><p>\u201cVery sure,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>The four men had returned to almost normal, except for the tension. Connor leaned against the car once he\u2019d gotten out of it, his face still tight.</p><p>\u201cWhy did he Summon Connor?\u201d Kim asked Liam in a low voice. \u201cIf he wants me, why didn\u2019t he just get you and your dad to bring me down? Or can\u2019t he pinpoint who he wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the spell can be very specific. Fergus decided who he\u2019d cast it on.\u201d</p><p>Kim looked at Connor, who had walked away to retch into a stand of tall grasses. \u201cWhat kind of ass**le is this guy? Connor doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>The Liam who looked at her was no longer the affable, sexy man she\u2019d met yesterday. The Liam next to her sparked with contained fury and would have scared the shit out of her if she\u2019d walked into the bar\u2019s office and seen him like this behind the desk. She realized that Liam had showed her the \u201cnice\u201d Shifter, the one humans could talk to. The one she could sit with on a bed and kiss.</p><p>No, wait, she could kiss him even now. She\u2019d taste his fury and let him know she shared it, while he ran his hands over her body.</p><p>How would sex with Liam be when he was like this? Raw and wild. Against the wall or on the hood of the car\u2014all-out, good-time sex. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.</p><p>Liam opened the door of the house and walked in. The inside didn\u2019t impress Kim. People obviously lived here, but they just as obviously didn\u2019t much care about cleaning up the place.</p><p>Liam strode through the cluttered living room and kitchen littered with dirty dishes, and opened a door. Cool air poured up stone stairs beyond. Cellar? Storm shelter? A place like that could house snakes, scorpions, black widows... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn there?\u201d she asked. She thought she could face a hostile Shifter, but spiders? Not so much.</p><p>Liam passed her without a word. Thank God for the Shifter custom of the male entering a place first. If there were spiders down there, Liam could stomp on them before she went down.</p><p>Dylan nodded at Sean, who\u2019d retrieved his sword from her trunk, indicating he should enter after Liam. Then Dylan, then Connor.</p><p>Kim hesitated at the top of the steps, still thinking about spiders\u2014and Fergus. She could run, make it to her car, and hightail it back to Austin. No one was behind her; she could get a good head start.</p> <p>Connor looked back at her, the light from the kitchen glinting on the fear in his eyes. He was terrified and, from the greenish cast to his face, still nauseated from the Summoning. Would the bully Fergus try to hurt Connor if Kim ran for it? Probably.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she growled, and started after Connor. She couldn\u2019t do that to the kid.</p><p>Connor flashed Kim a nervous grin and kept going. Kim picked her way along, feeling out of her depth and refusing to touch the stone walls.</p><p>The Morrissey men waited for them in a tiled corridor that was completely incongruous with the house above. The walls were polished wood and, to Kim\u2019s astonishment, filled with paintings and beautiful photographs. Real paintings by real artists that museums paid major money for, photographs by people like Ansel Adams. Spanish-style, carved wooden doors with small square windows lined the corridor between the priceless artwork.</p><p>What the hell kind of place was this?</p> <p>Liam led the way to the end of the hall and opened a door to a cavernous room. Dylan went in first this time, then Liam, then Sean, then Connor. Kim, in most need of protection, entered last.</p><p>The room was huge, meant to hold several hundred people. The walls were paneled with warm wood, the purple-red hue speaking of exotic Oriental forests. The ceiling was arched like a cathedral, the arches intricately carved and marching toward an enormous fireplace at the end. Money and artistry had gone into shaping the chamber, which was far larger than any of the houses above it.</p><p>The room was also filled with Shifters.</p><p>There must have been a hundred of them, each as physically honed as Liam, Dylan, and Sean. The sign outside said that only fifty-two Shifters lived in this Shiftertown, so these must have driven in for the occasion. Every single one was male.</p><p>The crowd parted as Dylan led the way forward, past the looming arches, through the sea of Shifters, to the center of the room. Four men waited for them there: a big guy with a long black braid and a leather motorcycle vest, surrounded by three equally thuglike men.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Kim whispered to Liam. \u201cThat\u2019s Fergus.\u201d</p> <p>Liam nodded grimly. Fergus turned hard blue eyes to Kim and gave her the Shifter once-over.</p><p>\u201cThis is her?\u201d he asked. His accent was more Southern than Texan, and his tone said he\u2019d expected her to be more formidable.</p><p>Liam set his mouth, and Dylan became their spokesman. \u201cThis is Kim Fraser, the defense attorney for Brian Smith.\u201d</p><p>All eyes on Kim. Nostrils flared as the Shifters took in Kim\u2019s scent and the fact that Liam had marked her. Every single Shifter in here wore a Collar, but it dawned on Kim that the Collars might not make a damn bit of difference if she tried to run or fight. These were dangerous men, watching for now because they chose to.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d she said under her breath. \u201cAnd me without my pepper spray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe like pepper spray,\u201d Liam answered.</p><p>\u201cFigures.\u201d</p><p>Fergus pinned her with a blue stare, then looked at Sean and held out his hand.</p> <p>Sean unstrapped the sword on his back and took it to him. Fergus didn\u2019t say thank you; he just grabbed the sword from Sean and passed it to one of his underlings. As he turned, strands of braided leather swung across his hip from a handle hooked to his belt.</p><p>\u201cIs that a cat-o\u2019-nine-tails?\u201d Kim asked Liam.</p><p>\u201cMost like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, in case he loses his own?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s sudden smile burst over his face. Connor laughed openly.</p><p>\u201cShut it,\u201d Dylan hissed.</p><p>Fergus\u2019s attention riveted to Kim. \u201cCome here, woman.\u201d</p><p>Kim remained where she was, not about to trot obediently to him. Liam stood beside her, his body solid and warm, making her feel suddenly safe.</p><p>\u201cI said, come here.\u201d</p><p>Kim lifted her chin. \u201cDo the words \u2018screw you\u2019 mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>Fergus\u2019s eyes glittered as the Shifters muttered to each other. Fergus\u2019s three henchmen folded their arms and glared. One had a shaved head and a neck covered in tattoos, one had a sandy blond ponytail, and the third had short black hair. He looked ex-military, although Shifters weren\u2019t allowed to join the military.</p><p>\u201cBring her to me,\u201d Fergus said curtly to Liam.</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t move. The room was silent, the tension ramping high. Fergus\u2019s eyes changed from blue to whitegray.</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t know what all Fergus could do\u2014another Summoning to make Liam drag her across the room to him? Kim felt like a sapling in a tall forest; Shifter males were mostly over six feet tall, and she was five feet high in flats. And where were all the women Shifters? Baking cookies?</p><p>\u201cYou know you can\u2019t kill me,\u201d Kim said in her brisk courtroom voice. \u201cThere\u2019s already one Shifter in jail because of a human\u2019s death, and even though I\u2019m convinced he didn\u2019t do it, plenty of people think he did. If I disappear or turn up dead, you\u2019ll have your county sheriff and possibly the feds all over you.\u201d</p><p>Fergus just stared at her, then turned to Liam. \u201cDoes she ever shut up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a point in her favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Liam said with a faint smile. \u201cI kind of like it.\u201d</p><p>Fergus\u2019s lip curled. \u201cBring her to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Fergus,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving that choice up to her.\u201d</p><p>The room held its collective breath. Kim didn\u2019t have to be an expert in nonverbal cues to see that Fergus\u2019s whole stance now said, Obey me or suffer. Liam\u2019s stance said, No way in hell, but Kim noticed he wouldn\u2019t meet Fergus\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt the woman,\u201d Fergus said, tight-lipped.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Kim broke in. \u201cWhy am I not reassured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d Liam\u2019s voice warmed her ear, his voice so tight she realized how much he must be holding himself back.</p><p>\u201cCould have fooled me.\u201d</p><p>Liam turned Kim to face him. He touched her cheek, his eyes wary but with a sparkle of excitement deep within them. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to hurt you, love,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThat was never his intention. When Fergus called Dad last night, he ordered us to bring you down here so he could claim you as his mate.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s blue eyes went wide, shining with anger, fear, and astonishment. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>Liam smoothed a lock of her hair, trying to soothe her with his Shifter touch. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, love. I\u2019m not going to let him.\u201d</p><p>It struck him suddenly that he\u2019d been waiting for something like this. Maybe all his life. He\u2019d told himself he\u2019d passed up potential mates to give other Shifter males a chance at happiness, but he realized now that he\u2019d simply not found a woman he wanted to be with. Easy to be altruistic when he wasn\u2019t making much of a sacrifice.</p><p>But when this sassy human female had walked into his office yesterday, with her blouse buttons straining, her short gray skirt smooth over her sweet rump, when she\u2019d started laying out a heated, well-reasoned argument why he should help her before Liam could even speak, his well-ordered world had overturned. She\u2019d managed to touch something that Liam had always kept protected. Maybe she\u2019d touched it because he hadn\u2019t kept his guard up, hadn\u2019t expected a human to reach what no Shifter had ever reached.</p><p>Last night, when Dylan had broken the news that Fergus expected Liam to bring Kim to him so Fergus could claim her as mate, Liam had flat-out refused. Dylan had argued, not understanding. What was the fate of one human against the good of all Shifters? Fergus could control Kim, and that would be the end of the matter.</p><p>Liam had nearly punched his father in the face, something he\u2019d never in his life dreamed of doing. Kim would go to Fergus over his dead body, he\u2019d said. Dylan had regarded Liam first in amazement, then comprehension, even sympathy. He\u2019d stopped arguing, told Liam he agreed to disobey Fergus, then walked out of the house.</p><p>Mate. Mine. Protect.</p><p>Liam wanted to hold Kim and not let her go. He wanted to kiss her, screw her, make her pancakes the next morning. The instincts that hadn\u2019t manifested in a hundred years of living suddenly rose and raged.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he want me to be his mate?\u201d Kim was asking. \u201cWhatever that means. He\u2019s never met me before today.\u201d</p><p>Goddess, how could a male not want her? But she had a point.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to control you,\u201d Liam said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re right. It would cause him major problems if he killed you. But if you\u2019re his mate, you\u2019re subject to him and clan law. And no longer a threat to Shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d</p><p>Fergus wasn\u2019t going to let her refuse. Liam wasn\u2019t certain how Fergus planned to subdue Kim\u2014drugs, spells, terror\u2014but the man wanted Kim under his thumb.</p><p>Fergus also likely wanted to see how far Liam would go to protect her. Once Fergus knew what Liam felt for Kim, the better he could manipulate Liam and the rest of his family. Either way, Kim would be watched, controlled.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to,\u201d Liam told Kim.</p><p>Fergus gave them a narrow stare. \u201cDoes this mean you make the Challenge for her?\u201d</p><p>Liam sensed Dylan and Sean move in behind him, their instinct to protect manifesting, no matter how bloody stupid they thought Liam was being. Liam wished Connor would get the hell out of here. Connor was a kid, a cub, and he wasn\u2019t ready yet for this kind of confrontation. Liam didn\u2019t think Fergus would take that into consideration when he started meting out punishment.</p><p>Liam slid his hand into Kim\u2019s, looked Fergus straight in the eye, and reached for a Texas phrase that would make Ellison proud.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Fergus\u2019s gaze locked with Liam\u2019s, and Liam felt a surge of triumph.</p><p>\u201cDylan,\u201d Fergus snapped.</p><p>Dylan answered in a calm voice. \u201cMy son is not yet mated. It\u2019s his right.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t defend me, Dad. Walk away. This isn\u2019t your fight.</p><p>Dylan remained in place. Liam hadn\u2019t really thought he\u2019d be wise and disappear. Dylan would never desert his offspring, even if it meant his death.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Kim burst out. Heads swiveled to her, a hundred pairs of Shifter eyes pinning her, but she didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cI don\u2019t like all this talk about mating, thank you very much\u2014especially when it involves me.\u201d</p><p>Liam wanted to laugh out loud. She was a treasure. Shifter instincts were starting to blot out his human reason, making him yearn for Fergus\u2019s blood under his claws and then Kim in his arms.</p><p>Sex with Kim would be glorious, even if he had to stay in human form for it. He\u2019d gotten a taste of her last night, her sweet mouth, her kisses, her touch on his body. He wanted to lie on top of her, practicing more human kissing as he slid inside her and made her his.</p><p>Fergus\u2019s own pheromones rolled off him, thick and strong, polluting the air. Smelling them, Liam realized Fergus didn\u2019t plan to make Kim mate in name only. He wanted Kim, wanted a furious f**k. Liam would die before he let that happen.</p><p>\u201cSilence her,\u201d Fergus growled at Liam.</p><p>Sean stepped to Kim\u2019s other side. Even without the sword, he stood like a warrior, ready to fight. \u201cLiam has made the Challenge,\u201d Sean said. \u201cNothing we can do but see how it plays out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cScrew that.\u201d Kim tried to twist out of Liam\u2019s hold, but Liam wasn\u2019t about to let her go. \u201cConnor,\u201d she said over her shoulder. \u201cCan you find something for me to stand on? A chair or something?\u201d</p><p>Her question jolted Connor out of his frozen terror. Good for Kim.</p><p>The Shifters parted to let Connor leave the room. Liam hoped it would take him hours to locate a chair, or that he\u2019d think better of returning at all, but Connor came back almost at once with a stepstool.</p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d Kim told him to put it on the floor in front of her, and Liam released her long enough to let her climb on it. He kept his arms around her as she straightened up, both to steady her and to keep her in his protective hold.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d Kim said. The stool let her stand half a head taller than Liam, and now she could look across the crowd of Shifters.</p><p>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t need to be any violence over this,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat y\u2019all don\u2019t understand is that I can be the best friend you\u2019ve got. You have a Shifter in jail, and the world howling for his blood. If I can prove he didn\u2019t kill his human girlfriend, think what terrific PR that would be for all of you. Shifters are viewed with suspicion and hostility. If I show the world that Brian was wronged, make him a sympathetic figure, even a hero, imagine what an amazing step forward that would be. They might let you integrate more, let your kids go to schools that aren\u2019t held in abandoned warehouses.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Not one expression changed.</p><p>\u201cHey, maybe they\u2019d even let us have cable,\u201d a Shifter in the back drawled. The room rumbled with male laughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019m good at my job. I can do this if you help me.\u201d</p> <p>Fergus\u2019s mouth drew to a thin line. \u201cLiam, shut her up.\u201d</p><p>Liam wasn\u2019t about to. Kim had Fergus baffled, and he liked that.</p><p>\u201cYou act like you don\u2019t want Brian released.\u201d Kim went on. \u201cHe didn\u2019t kill Michelle. Why should he be executed for it? Why would you let him be?\u201d</p><p>Fergus drew the cat-o\u2019-nine-tails from his belt. \u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to whip me?\u201d Kim asked Liam in amazement.</p><p>Liam lifted Kim off the stool. \u201cTime to stop talking, love. Fergus, if we\u2019re doing this Challenge, let\u2019s get on with it, man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot until I teach the bitch some manners.\u201d</p><p>Connor stormed forward despite Sean\u2019s attempts to restrain him. The young man\u2019s face was red, his large hands in fists. \u201cLeave her alone! She\u2019s not doing anything to you. She\u2019s just talking. How can that hurt you, you bastard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, shut it,\u201d Dylan said fiercely.</p><p>Fergus\u2019s gaze chilled the air as it rested on Connor. \u201cCome here, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a cub,\u201d Dylan tried. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Connor wiped his eyes. \u201cI understand, Grandda\u2019.\u201d He glared at Fergus, though he dropped his gaze almost immediately. \u201cI meant it too.\u201d</p><p>Fergus was livid. Cords stood out on his neck, and his eyes burned with the intensity of a feral\u2019s.</p><p>Liam knew full well how Fergus had envisioned this cozy scenario: Liam and family would scurry down to San Antonio, hand Kim over in abject apology, then hurry away again, letting Fergus do whatever the hell he wanted.</p> <p>Instead all four Morrisseys had defied him\u2014twice. The first time by refusing to respond to his verbal summons, yesterday. Now, in Fergus\u2019s own lair, Kim had lectured him, Liam had made the Challenge, and Connor had broken the rule of a cub not confronting an alpha before he was of age.</p><p>Cubs could get away with a lot on account of their youth\u2014Goddess knew Liam had been a pain in the ass during puberty\u2014but flouting Fergus in front of the whole clan could not go unpunished. Connor was too young to fight for dominance, so he\u2019d have to be swatted, as a lion might bat aside a cub who\u2019d gotten too rambunctious.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Fergus repeated.</p><p>The magic in the command propelled Connor toward him. Sean started after him, but Liam shook his head. \u201cNo, Sean, let me.\u201d</p><p>Sean opened his mouth to argue, then nodded, his eyes bleak. He turned away, unhappy, but knowing why he had to stand down.</p><p>\u201cLet you what?\u201d Kim asked Liam.</p><p>Her eyes were wide in her white face. She was afraid and angry, and so damn beautiful she made his heart ache.</p><p>Liam cupped her face in his hands. \u201cKim, my love, stay here with Sean and Dylan. Don\u2019t even think about coming after me, and please, stay quiet.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s lips parted as though she wanted to protest. Then she closed her mouth and nodded. Good girl. Liam turned from her and swiftly followed Connor.</p><p>Liam was the same height as Fergus. He and the big man looked at each other eye to eye, Liam without flinching.</p><p>\u201cIf you do this,\u201d Fergus said in vicious fury, \u201cthen when I answer your mate Challenge, I\u2019ll wipe the floor with you.\u201d</p><p>Gods, what an arrogant bastard. \u201cJust get on with it.\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s eyes held tears, but his head was up, though he couldn\u2019t meet Fergus\u2019s gaze or even Liam\u2019s. \u201cNo, Liam. Leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my right, nephew,\u201d Liam said quietly.</p><p>Two of the thugs, the one with the shaved head and the black-haired one, divested Connor of his shirt. Connor couldn\u2019t meet their eyes either.</p><p>Liam stripped off his own shirt and dropped it on the floor. The thugs ignored him. They turned Connor around and bent him forward at the waist, exposing his young, unblemished back.</p><p>Fergus raised his cat-o\u2019-nine-tails. With a grunt, he brought it down. Before it could strike Connor, Liam leaned over his nephew and took the blow directly across his own back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Kim shrieked. \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d</p><p>Horror filled her as Fergus, eyes fixed, mouth curled in vicious enjoyment, struck again. The sound of the leather swished through the silence, followed by the slap against Liam\u2019s skin.</p><p>Dylan moved toward them, grim-faced, tugging off his shirt to reveal a back as broad and muscular as Liam\u2019s. When he reached Connor and Liam, he leaned over Connor as well, father and son enclosing the boy in a protective Shifter embrace. Fergus continued to ply the whip as though he didn\u2019t notice, lips pulling back from teeth that had become fangs.</p><p>Kim started forward, but Sean stepped in front of her, blocking her way. \u201cStay here. Let it finish.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s eyes held anguish, but she saw he wasn\u2019t about to try to stop Fergus. She also sensed that if Sean hadn\u2019t felt the need to keep Kim bottled up here, he\u2019d have joined the human shield around Connor.</p><p>\u201cThis is insane,\u201d she said, heart in her throat. Barbaric, uncivilized.</p><p>But they\u2019re Shifters, a voice whispered in her head. Isn\u2019t that why they\u2019re forced to wear the Collars, to keep their barbarism under control?</p><p>The Collar wasn\u2019t doing jack to keep Fergus from beating Liam and Dylan to bloody pulp. The leather straps opened Liam\u2019s flesh, and blood dribbled to the floor. Liam was taking the brunt of it, only some of the blows hitting Dylan, as though Fergus\u2019s aim was to debilitate Liam only. Nothing reached Connor, enclosed in a Shifter wall.</p><p>The other Shifters watched without comment, no murmuring, no growling, neither egging Fergus on nor trying to stop him. The beating went on and on, as though Fergus was taking out years of welled-up aggression on the Morrisseys.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do something?\u201d Kim asked Sean, tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Shifter way.\u201d Sean\u2019s mouth was set in a grim line.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a f**ked-up way.\u201d</p><p>Kim waited until Sean again turned to watch, then darted around him and ran through the pack. Short height could be an advantage\u2014the tall Shifters weren\u2019t used to dealing with one small, athletic female slithering through their grasps.</p><p>She reached Fergus. \u201cStop this!\u201d</p><p>Fergus gave Liam two more vicious blows, then trained his awful gaze on Kim. He was far more frightening than Dylan, his eyes red with rage, a tinge of madness in them. She was looking at a man who would do absolutely anything, no matter how ruthless, to get what he wanted. No holds barred.</p><p>Liam jerked his head up. \u201cSean, take her out of here.\u201d</p><p>Sean was already behind Kim. Kim spun away and put herself right under Fergus\u2019s nose. Fergus snarled. His face had half changed, his lips peeling back from his red, angry mouth. She thought of the Lupine who\u2019d tried to kill her, and realized that Fergus wasn\u2019t too far removed from that un-Collared Shifter\u2019s vicious rage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Shifter,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>Big fat lie. The man was terrifying, and Kim had no doubt he could kill her fast. But Kim couldn\u2019t stand by and watch him beat on Liam, whose back was now coated with blood.</p><p>Fergus went for her, whip raised. Liam lunged at him with a fighting snarl. The sound filled the room, loud and inhuman.</p><p>Fergus\u2019s eyes glittered, not in fear, but in glee. A second later, Dylan was next to Liam, his skin glistening with sweat and blood.</p><p>\u201cNo, Liam. It\u2019s not your right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him,\u201d Fergus said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dylan\u2019s voice was hard.</p><p>As Kim watched, tiny sparks raced around Liam\u2019s Collar and into his flesh. Liam flinched as his muscles registered the shock, but he never took his eyes from Fergus.</p><p>So the Collars did work. Liam was in a deadly rage, his adrenal system signaling he was ready to fight and kill. The Collar was trying to stop him, to once again torture him from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her words seemed to penetrate the haze of fury in Liam\u2019s brain. Liam broke the gaze lock with Fergus, turned his head, and looked down at Kim.</p><p>\u201cI claim her as mate,\u201d he growled.</p><p>To Kim\u2019s surprise, Fergus\u2019s angry look receded until he almost smirked. He spread his arms, the ends of the cat-o\u2019-nine-tails fluttering. \u201cI hereby release my claim. I wouldn\u2019t want the bitch in my house, anyway, with my cubs. I wish you joy of her.\u201d</p><p>The Shifters let out their collective breaths, stances relaxing. What the hell? \u201cLiam...\u201d</p><p>Liam seized Kim\u2019s arm, his hand slick with blood. \u201cI claim her before the clan, as is my right.\u201d</p><p>Fergus\u2019s eyes glinted. \u201cThe clan recognizes your claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe changed his mind quick,\u201d Kim said. \u201cFastest one-night stand I ever had.\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed, the sound rumbling. Fergus looked triumphant, as if he\u2019d won, his eyes glittering in a way Kim didn\u2019t like.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t giving in. He was planning something.</p><p>Fergus gave the rest of the room a flat stare. \u201cEverybody out.\u201d</p><p>The Shifters started to leave, their voices growing louder as they wound down. Kim wondered how many truly supported Fergus and how many had been compelled here like Liam and his family. Glory had said Shifters didn\u2019t like clan leaders who used the Summons so maybe Fergus had simply bullied them into showing up.</p><p>Fergus stepped past the Morrisseys, followed by his thugs, the only ones who hadn\u2019t relaxed. His bodyguards, Kim realized. Fergus was the clan leader, the ultimate alpha, or whatever. But if he had such power over the clan, why did he worry so much that he\u2019d lose it?</p><p>Dylan pulled his shirt back on, wincing when the fabric touched his raw back. Liam took his T-shirt from Sean and balled it in his hands, his back a bloody mess.</p><p>Liam had rushed to protect Connor from dire hurt, and Dylan had rushed to protect both his son and grandson. Kim understood love like that, the same that had reared up and kicked her when she hadn\u2019t been able to save her brother all those years ago.</p><p>She took Liam\u2019s T-shirt from his hands, giving him a watery smile as she shook it out and folded it.</p><p>The only one not pleased was Connor. When the last of the Shifters had left the room, Connor launched himself at Liam. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did you do that? I could have taken it. I didn\u2019t ask you to stand in for me.\u201d</p><p>Tears of rage and frustration streamed from Connor\u2019s eyes as he beat on Liam\u2019s chest.</p><p>Liam grabbed his fists, his voice incredibly gentle. \u201cConnor, lad, stop that now.\u201d</p><p>Connor jerked away from him. He started to strike at Dylan, then probably realizing that was a bad idea, rounded on Sean. Sean responded by wrapping his arms around Connor and pulling him close.</p> <p>Liam moved behind Connor and stroked the young man\u2019s hair. \u201cThe punishment wasn\u2019t for you, Con. Fergus was pissed at me for not groveling enough. He couldn\u2019t come up with a legitimate reason to have me beaten, so he picked on you. It wasn\u2019t your transgression, lad, it was mine.\u201d</p><p>Kim saw Connor relax, the young man leaning into Sean. \u201cWhy\u2019d you let him? Grandda\u2019, why didn\u2019t you fight him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the time and place,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cCome on, we have to go.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left the room without waiting for them, his boots clicking on the tiles of the hall. Connor finally unwound his arms from Sean and went after Dylan, wiping his eyes, and the other three followed.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to explain what the hell just happened, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Kim asked, as she started up the stairs ahead of Liam. After the elegant surroundings in the basement, the stairs were dingy and musty. She thought about spiders again.</p> <p>Liam ruffled her hair. \u201cKim, who likes everything nice and neat. What a woman.\u201d</p><p>He caressed her neck under her hair. He might have just gotten skin whipped off his back, but his touch still raised goose bumps on Kim\u2019s flesh. It was the touch of a man desiring a woman, nothing less.</p><p>Damn if she didn\u2019t want to turn around right there and jump his bones. Never mind that his father, brother, and nephew were only a few steps ahead of them. Kim wanted to kiss Liam as she had last night, maybe have him lift her so she could wrap her legs around his waist.</p><p>Liam kissed the corner of her mouth. \u201cCome on, love. Let\u2019s go out to the sunshine.\u201d</p><p>Kim kissed him back, which did not dampen her fires; then she made herself turn and follow Sean up. They clattered through the silent house, then out the front door.</p><p>The Shifters were waiting for them, all of them, arranged in a semicircle between them and Kim\u2019s car. Kim\u2019s heart started to pound.</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t they going to let us leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>Doors around the group of houses were opening, and female Shifters emerged. With kids. Happy to be released from whatever confinement had been imposed on them, the kids raced to the playground, making the sad patch of grass suddenly come alive. The entire dog population joined them, tails waving.</p><p>Fergus had clipped his cat-o\u2019-nine back to his belt, and now stood with arms folded, talking to some of the male Shifters. Kim almost fell over with shock when a woman moved through the crowd and slid her arm around Fergus\u2019s waist. She wasn\u2019t some wimpy thing, either\u2014she was tall, strong, muscular, with a hard but beautiful face. Like Glory, though not as flamboyantly dressed.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d Kim asked Liam.</p><p>\u201cHis mate,\u201d Liam said. \u201cAndrea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait.\u201d Kim waved her hands. \u201cHe was going on about taking me as his mate. Why, if he already has one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClan leaders can mate with more than one woman, and Fergus has two already. Selfish, because there aren\u2019t many females to go around, but it\u2019s true that mixed offspring have a better chance of surviving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d Kim rounded on Liam. \u201cCan you have more than one mate? Do you have three wives tucked away in Shiftertowns around the state?\u201d</p><p>Liam burst out laughing, and Sean followed suit. Their laughter held a note of tension, as if they were happy they had something to laugh about. Liam put his arm around Kim. \u201cI couldn\u2019t handle more than you, love. And I hope you can handle me.\u201d</p><p>His smile gave the double entendre impact. Kim flushed. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Liam walked Kim out to the semicircle of Shifters. He didn\u2019t retrieve his shirt; his back had to be killing him under the burning sun.</p><p>Fergus faced them as they approached, Andrea letting go of him but remaining only inches from his side.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she want him?\u201d Kim whispered. \u201cEspecially when he has another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he is the most powerful man in the clan. Only Dad comes close to him for dominance. And I should have mentioned that Shifters have terrific hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d Fergus\u2019s voice rolled across those of the other Shifters and the kids playing. \u201cStand here.\u201d</p><p>Liam stopped in front of Fergus and turned Kim to face him. He brushed a finger over Kim\u2019s cheek, then held up her left hand in his right, twining their fingers.</p><p>Without waiting for everyone to quiet down, Fergus said, \u201cUnder the light of the sun, I recognize this mating.\u201d</p><p>He spoke in a monotone, the words rapid, as though he wanted to get this over with. He was ready to move on to the next thing, and Kim wondered what that next thing was.</p><p>Liam smiled at Kim. The other Shifters started clapping and cheering, and Connor threw his arms around Kim and gave her a breath-stealing hug.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Kim.\u201d</p><p>Before Kim could ask, \u201cFor what?\u201d Connor was leaping away, whooping and yelling with the others. Fergus twined his arm around Andrea\u2019s waist and walked away with her.</p><p>Kim never knew where it came from, but all of a sudden beer foam showered the air. Sean shook a bottle and sprayed it over them, laughing hysterically. He\u2019d gotten his sword back, she saw, the hilt protruding over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJust what I wanted, beer in my hair,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>Liam rubbed his thumb across her chin. \u201cWe\u2019ll have time to wash it out later.\u201d He leaned down and pressed dry, warm lips to her mouth. \u201cIs this kiss up to your standards? I\u2019m still learning.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but his skin was hot under her fingertips, his chest still sweating. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d Kim asked. \u201cI saw the Collar shock you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live.\u201d Another light kiss, Liam\u2019s hand stealing to her waist. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of another ache right now.\u201d</p><p>The stiff thing pressing her abdomen left no doubt about what he meant. \u201cYou\u2019re back\u2019s a mess,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll be washing that along with your hair.\u201d</p><p>Liam kissed her again. Around them, the Shifters partied, a complete change from the cold resentment in the basement. They could have been at a block party, friends and neighbors coming together to celebrate. Dylan struck up conversation with some of the Shifter men, and Sean had been lured away by a couple of females. Sean and the ladies were flirting pretty fiercely, although Shifters liked to touch a lot, so maybe they were discussing movies or something while hands ran along arms and shoulders and backs.</p><p>Questions swam in Kim\u2019s brain\u2014she\u2019d thought she\u2019d researched everything about Shifters, but she realized she\u2019d only learned what they\u2019d let humans learn. There was too much she didn\u2019t know, too many nuances she needed to understand. She hadn\u2019t argued about this \u201cmating\u201d with Liam because she saw that it let Liam walk away from Fergus, and Fergus stop trying to beat up on Connor and Dylan. And she definitely hadn\u2019t wanted to do any kind of mating with Fergus.</p><p>She\u2019d smile and laugh with them, go along with their pretense that everything was all right, but once they got back to Austin, she and Liam were going to have a long talk.</p><p>A shadow fell over her, and Kim looked up to see Fergus looming next to them. \u201cYou accept the mating?\u201d he asked Liam.</p><p>He asked Liam, not Kim. Asshole.</p><p>Liam\u2019s expression remained cool. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what it means, then?\u201d Fergus kept his voice soft, turning away from the other Shifters. \u201cYou are responsible for everything she does. She steps a toe out of line, it\u2019s you who pays. Your father won\u2019t interfere; he knows the rules.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s anger flared. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>She found Liam\u2019s fingers over her lips. \u201cNot now,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what it means, Fergus. You forgo the claim forever, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I have a condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does that not surprise me?\u201d Kim muttered behind Liam\u2019s fingers.</p><p>\u201cBrian goes down,\u201d Fergus said. \u201cYou, woman, will let him, and Liam, you\u2019ll make sure she does it. He pleads guilty and takes the punishment. Those are my terms.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for their answer, he turned from them and walked away.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Liam knew that Kim didn\u2019t understand. He held her hand as she drove, and sensed the confusion pouring off her. He\u2019d explain everything to her soon, but right now he just wanted to have her pull the car over so he could drag her off and sex her.</p><p>He burned with it. When a Shifter claimed a mate, the urge to procreate released. He\u2019d always known that in theory but never realized it would be this much of a flood. It was all he could do to stop at holding Kim\u2019s hand. He wanted to slide his fingers under the waistband of her jeans, lean over and press kisses to her neck, unbutton her blouse and dip his hand inside.</p><p>The little sweetheart hadn\u2019t let him get into the car until she\u2019d dragged a towel and a first-aid kit out of her trunk, demanded a bottle of clean water from one of the Shifters, and doctored Liam\u2019s back. She\u2019d rinsed and dried the wounds, then applied antiseptic, which had stung a little.</p><p>Liam had tried to tell her he\u2019d heal quickly, but she only clenched her teeth and doctored him anyway. He also couldn\u2019t tell her, with Sean and Connor hovering, that her touch fired his longing to open his pants and have a go with her right there.</p><p>The others must have sensed his craving, because the teasing had begun.</p><p>\u201cSo does a mate\u2019s touch really heal, Liam?\u201d Sean had asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to last until we get home.\u201d Connor snickered beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live, son,\u201d Dylan had said, clapping Liam on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>Kim hadn\u2019t known what the hell they were talking about, but from her blush, she\u2019d suspected.</p><p>He squeezed Kim\u2019s thigh now, and she responded with a smile, albeit a nervous one. Not disgust, not, \u201cKeep your hands off me, Shifter.\u201d Kim liked him. Would she like him after she fully understood what was happening?</p><p>\u201cDamnation,\u201d Connor said from the backseat.</p><p>Liam looked over his shoulder. Connor\u2019s nose was buried in a magazine Kim had grabbed for him at the convenience store where they\u2019d stopped for gas. Though Kim had offered to pay for gas, magazine, and cold sodas, Dylan had silently fished out some cash and pressed it into her hand.</p><p>It was a sports magazine, because the only thing Connor liked better than cars was sports, football in particular. Not American football with pigskin and pads, but real football, what Americans called soccer. Connor had never been to a true football game, in a stadium overflowing with raving crowds that made American fans look like a pack of knitting grannies. Connor watched it on telly when he could and avidly followed the Republic of Ireland national football team in the sports news.</p><p>\u201cIreland is playing today,\u201d Connor mourned. \u201cTonight for them, but today over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever on a major network,\u201d Sean said. \u201cThat would be a bloody miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSportz 3.\u201d Connor lifted the magazine sideways, studying the grid of sports offerings for the week. \u201cSatellite channel. Game starts in an hour.\u201d He sounded glum.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, Con,\u201d Dylan said. He leaned against the window and closed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a human game, anyway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dylan had never understood Connor\u2019s obsession with sports. But then Dylan had grown up two centuries ago, far from human society, while Connor had spent his entire young life immersed in it. Connor was what Shifters were trying to create by taking the Collar, a generation comfortable with human culture. Maybe in a few generations, the Collars could become a thing of the past, forgotten, Shifters fully integrated into human society.</p><p>Dylan wanted that. But it didn\u2019t mean he understood Connor\u2019s addiction.</p><p>\u201cEllison has a friend in Shiftertown North,\u201d Sean said. \u201cHe can sometimes get satellite channels. Maybe we can get you up there to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an hour?\u201d Connor shook his head. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen that jury-rigged TV. You have to turn off all the lights, tilt your head sideways, and squint. If he\u2019s lucky and can get a signal at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s bound to be a recording somewhere,\u201d Sean said. \u201cMe and Liam will look around for it.\u201d</p><p>Connor threw down the magazine. \u201cStop babying me, Sean. I\u2019ll not see it, and you know it. It\u2019s not like the local DVD stores have a huge section on Irish football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you can watch it at my house,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>All four Shifters stopped and stared at her. \u201cI have every satellite channel known to man,\u201d Kim went on. \u201cPlus a new flat-screen. No beer, though. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Connor shoved himself between the seats, eyes alight. \u201cAre you serious? You\u2019d let me watch your telly at your house?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d</p><p>Dylan answered. \u201cBecause your neighbors might object to you with a houseful of Shifters. Police might be called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not against the law for a human to invite over Shifters. Unusual, maybe. And anyway, we\u2019ll go in through the garage and no one will see us.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twould be an imposition we can\u2019t ask,\u201d Dylan said, his tone holding finality.</p><p>Connor made a frustrated noise. Liam sympathized with his frustration but for a different reason. He\u2019d pictured taking Kim to Shiftertown and locking them both in his bedroom for three days. But he understood that Kim was offering this hospitality to try to make up for Fergus dragging Connor into this mess\u2014a mess she thought she\u2019d caused.</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t know that the mess with Fergus was ongoing, that the incident today was a drop in the vast ocean of their struggle with the clan leader. Fergus had gotten what he\u2019d wanted\u2014control of Kim and how she managed Brian\u2019s case. Or so Fergus believed. Kim hadn\u2019t said anything after Fergus had given her his \u201cterms.\u201d She\u2019d scowled but kept her lips pressed together, which Liam didn\u2019t think boded well. Fergus seriously underestimated Kim if he thought she\u2019d simply fall into line.</p> <p>However, in theory, now Fergus could threaten Liam and the rest of the Morrisseys if Kim didn\u2019t cooperate. Plus Fergus\u2019s capitulation had made him look generous to the rest of the clan\u2014he\u2019d been unwilling to stand between a Shifter and his true mate. Wasn\u2019t that noble of him?</p><p>\u201cBut trying to hold me prisoner in Shiftertown isn\u2019t an imposition?\u201d Kim demanded. \u201cI\u2019m driving the car, and we\u2019re going to my house so Connor can watch Irish football.\u201d</p><p>Connor hooted with joy and kissed Kim\u2019s cheek. \u201cI love you, Kim. I\u2019m so glad Liam claimed you.\u201d</p><p>Kim looked startled but said nothing. Connor thumped happily back in his seat, and Dylan made a \u201cWhatever\u201d gesture.</p><p>Of course, Liam thought as the Austin exits started to glide by, Kim\u2019s house also had a bedroom.</p><p>An hour later, Kim had four Shifters in her living room avidly watching guys in shorts running across a soccer field in rainy Ireland.</p><p>I could grow to like this game, Kim thought. No helmets or padding, just tight-fitting shirts, enticing glimpses of chest hair, and socks and shorts that emphasized muscular legs.</p><p>Not that the Shifters gave a damn what the men looked like. Not five minutes into the game, they were shouting and cheering, cursing or high-fiving. At least Sean and Connor were. Dylan watched with interest if not enthusiasm, and Liam restlessly left the room and followed Kim to the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cYou made them very happy.\u201d Liam leaned on the counter while Kim looked at her mostly empty refrigerator. She wasn\u2019t equipped to entertain men, that was certain. No beer, no chips, or whatever men chowed down on when they watched sports. She was pretty sure Abel watched sports, but she\u2019d never caught him doing it.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be happy when they get hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t care.\u201d Liam slid his arms around her from behind. \u201cNow, about that shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam. Your dad\u2019s in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd likely to stay while the game\u2019s going. Your bathroom\u2019s upstairs, if I remember.\u201d He kissed her neck under her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true I\u2019d like to take a look at your back again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my back?\u201d Liam nuzzled her cheek. \u201cDamn, woman, have mercy on a poor Shifter.\u201d</p><p>He licked her neck, his tongue hot and wet. Kim closed her eyes, a shiver traveling from her breastbone to the cleft between her legs.</p><p>He wanted sex, and she knew it. Wanted it, craved it, and wasn\u2019t ashamed of it. Kim couldn\u2019t lie to herself. She wanted Liam back, with her whole body.</p><p>The crowd on TV roared, and Sean, Connor, and even Dylan were on their feet, shouting. Through the open door to the living room, Kim saw Sean and Connor slam together in a joyful hug.</p><p>Liam nipped Kim\u2019s ear. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be real. There\u2019s sports on TV, and you want to go off with a woman instead.\u201d</p><p>He slanted her a hot smile. \u201cWhat you call soccer isn\u2019t my thing. Now if it had been Gaelic football...\u201d He laughed. Kim had no idea what the difference was, but she liked the sound of his laughter.</p><p>Liam took Kim\u2019s hand and led her to the staircase. As they ascended, the others continued to relive the glory moment of the goal.</p><p>Kim\u2019s main bathroom was huge\u2014when she\u2019d gone through her redecorating frenzy, she\u2019d combined a hall bathroom with the master bath for one giant bathroom fest. She had a two-person tub in the middle, a large stone-tiled shower on one end, and a gigantic vanity on the other.</p><p>\u201cYou put a refrigerator and a TV in here, and you\u2019d never have to leave,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cFunny. Get your shirt off.\u201d</p><p>Liam skimmed his T-shirt over his head faster than she could blink. His chest rose with his quick breath, strong bone and muscle under tight, smooth skin. Dark hair curled across his chest to his abdomen. His Collar gleamed, the black and silver links moving with his skin. It might be a symbol of his captivity, but Liam standing with bare torso, jeans riding low on his hips, and the chain around his neck was sexier than any male model could ever hope to be.</p><p>Kim wanted to touch every one of his muscles, trace them from shoulders to spine, pausing at his backside to spend a little time there.</p><p>The stripes Fergus had laid on Liam\u2019s back had already closed, though the bruises remained. In a couple of days, Kim guessed, no one would be able to tell he\u2019d been beaten.</p><p>She gently touched the closing wounds. \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, we heal fast.\u201d Liam gave her a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s hurting me, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>His pants came off a little slower than his shirt but only because he had to unzip them. His underwear followed in a flash, and then Kim found six feet, six inches of aroused male Shifter in her arms.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt me,\u201d Liam whispered. His skin was hot and satin smooth under her touch, glistening with sweat. \u201cI need you, Kim. It\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d she asked, worried.</p><p>\u201cMating instinct. It makes me want to f**k or die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smooth-talker, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I claimed you as mate, and my body wants to complete the process.\u201d</p><p>No kidding. Kim curved into his embrace, not unhappy to flow against his body. He might call it \u201cmating instinct,\u201d but Kim called it desire, one so strong there wasn\u2019t a cure but to give in to it.</p><p>Liam kissed her forehead and dropped kisses in her hair. Kim let her hands rove his shoulders and then his back, down to his fine, firm bu**ocks.</p><p>\u201cYou feel good,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou feel good touching me. Your hands are so cool.\u201d</p><p>She went on stroking his bu**ocks, the muscles as strong as she thought they\u2019d be. \u201cYou have a nice ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d Large hands clasped it.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost natural thing in the world, mating. The Earth goddess and Earth father joining to make the seasons continue. We\u2019re a part of that.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cYou know, I think that\u2019s the best pick-up line I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>Liam licked the side of her neck. \u201cIs it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConflict of interest. I could compromise the case.\u201d</p><p>Liam kissed her, fingers loosening her blouse. He didn\u2019t answer, and she remembered Fergus\u2019s parting words, that Kim was to drop Brian\u2019s defense and leave the poor guy to take the fall.</p><p>The fall for what?</p><p>Kim had expected Liam to tell Fergus to stuff his terms, but Liam hadn\u2019t protested. Did Liam join Fergus in wanting to throw Brian to the wolves?</p><p>\u201cLiam, we need to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Talk was obviously not on Liam\u2019s agenda. He kept up the scalding kisses, hands stroking. Her body became pliant, the space between her legs moist and needy.</p><p>His hardness pressed her abdomen, the feel of it making her ni**les tight. She slid her hand down before she could stop herself and closed it around his penis.</p><p>Damn. He was frigging enormous. The shaft pressed her palm, moving a little with his pulse. His skin was hot, and she\u2019d never felt a man\u2019s need so obviously before.</p><p>Not a man. A Shifter.</p><p>What women speculated about Shifter men was obviously true. They were bigger. And stiffer and hotter. Kim rubbed her thumb over his tip, feeling it slick and needy.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t appear to hear her. His eyes flicked to slits, cat\u2019s eyes, and he growled low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn into something while I\u2019m holding you.\u201d Kim squeezed his shaft, and Liam let out a soft groan. \u201cThat would be just too weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans.\u201d Liam nipped her ear. \u201cTeach me more about kissing.\u201d His tongue moved to her mouth, slid briefly between her lips.</p><p>Liam might not know how to kiss with finesse, but he did it with fervor. He licked her mouth from corner to corner, hands roving her back. Downstairs, Sean and Connor gave another whoop of victory, and Kim wanted to echo it up here. Liam\u2019s teeth scraped her mouth, his kiss clumsy, but his hands were skilled.</p><p>He loosened her blouse and brushed the tops of her br**sts with callused fingers. Her lacy bra parted.</p><p>\u201cLet me see you.\u201d</p><p>Kim let go of Liam long enough to pull her blouse open, to let her bra fall to the floor. Liam\u2019s gaze roved her, his cheeks flushed, eyes dark.</p><p>Abel had never looked at Kim like this, as though she were some Greek goddess. Liam cupped her breast almost reverently and slid his thumb across the areola. The nipple rose and tightened, and Liam leaned down and tugged it lightly with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d he whispered into her skin.</p><p>Abel had never said that, either. \u201cFor a human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor an anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t disgust you, then?\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed softly. \u201cStand still and take a compliment, love. Your body is made for loving.\u201d He moved his hand down her abdomen and unbuttoned her jeans. \u201cI like that your hips are so curved.\u201d The zipper went down, the jeans slid past her butt, cool air touched her thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFat-assed, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not meaning that, and you know it.\u201d Liam\u2019s hands eased her jeans to her ankles. \u201cSo you wore the thong, then.\u201d</p><p>His big hand found her bare butt cheek, betraying the truth of the statement. He softly kneaded, and Kim shivered. Here she was, in nothing but a thong in the middle of her bathroom, pressed against the hottest man she\u2019d ever seen in her life.</p><p>Liam kissed his way down her neck and licked up between her br**sts, and Kim\u2019s thoughts ceased being coherent. Liam bit her lip, then her cheek, strong hand moving to her nape and holding her there.</p> <p>The thought tapped on her brain that even with the Collar, Liam was three times as strong as any man she\u2019d ever been with. He could toss Abel across a room without working up a sweat. He could rip away her clothes in a heartbeat.</p><p>As though he read her thoughts, Liam hooked his fingers around the elastic of the thong and twisted it until it broke. His fingers found the moisture between her thighs, and she gasped, arching into his hand.</p><p>Liam eased back from the long kiss, both of them breathing faster. He softened his grip on her neck, caressing a little as though in apology.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d His eyes were still the cat\u2019s, narrow, slitted, light blue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty tough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a little bit of a thing.\u201d Liam\u2019s voice went soft with wonder. \u201cYou\u2019re so small, so fragile.\u201d The caresses on her neck changed to a light touch. \u201cGoddess, what if I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Kim smiled a hot smile. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard a guy call me \u2018a little bit of a thing.\u2019 Usually it\u2019s, \u2018Are you sure you want to eat that, Kim? You know you\u2019re watching your weight.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew them.\u201d</p><p>Kim touched her forehead to Liam\u2019s, looking into his scary eyes without flinching. \u201cI\u2019d rather screw you.\u201d</p><p>Another growl came from his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can hold back. I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA virgin Shifter? What do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI meant not with a human woman.\u201d Liam furrowed her hair with strong fingers. \u201cEspecially one so soft.\u201d</p><p>Kim wriggled against his body. \u201cWe have to do this,\u201d she said. \u201cI predict that we\u2019ll implode if we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Another cheer erupted from downstairs, followed by prolonged shouting. Kim had to wonder which room was more charged, her living room or this one.</p><p>Liam\u2019s growl changed to an animalistic snarl, and he pulled Kim down with him to the bathroom floor. She found herself on top of him, straddling him, her fluffy white rug cushioning her knees.</p><p>Liam held her hips. \u201cDo this, Kim. I don\u2019t trust myself.\u201d</p><p>Kim hardly trusted herself. She leaned forward and kissed his lips, at the same time shifting her hips so that his tip rested against her opening. \u201cYou\u2019re a hell of a man, Liam Morrissey. I only met you yesterday, and today you\u2019re sexing me on my bathroom rug.\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t answer, his face tight. Kim leaned forward a little more, then slid back onto him.</p><p>Oh, dear God in heaven. She closed her eyes, her head going back as a groan left her mouth. Liam was big, but she was so wet that she slid smoothly onto him, her body happy to accommodate him. But the feeling...She groaned again, she who never made noise when she had sex. She prided herself on being discreet, even delicate. She realized now she\u2019d never wanted to make noise, never had reason to.</p> <p>Liam\u2019s hard face softened, his eyes changing back to the deep blue she\u2019d already come to love. He made a raw noise as his warm hands moved to her br**sts, rough fingertips catching on her ni**les.</p><p>\u201cI never knew humans could be so beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kim smiled, her heart warming as it beat faster. He was the beautiful one. And skilled. She\u2019d teased him about being a \u201cvirgin,\u201d but Liam obviously knew exactly what he was doing.</p><p>Kim felt the loops of her white rug on her knees, the fiery heat where they joined, Liam\u2019s soothing hands. He smelled of sweat and sex and himself. His chest shone with perspiration, the black curls damp across hard pectorals. His jaw was dark with unshaved whiskers, which glistened as he rocked his head back, eyes closing in ecstasy.</p><p>Kim leaned down and kissed him, tasting male musk and the cold soft drink he\u2019d drunk in the car. He slid his hands to her waist, letting his hips rise and rise again, pressing himself ever deeper inside her. Kim\u2019s head lolled back, and she let sound come out unchecked, drowned out by the television and shouting downstairs.</p><p>Liam half sat up, helping her ride him. Their lips met, parted. His eyes remained dark blue, although once or twice they flickered to the cat\u2019s until he forced them dark again. He was holding back with effort, Kim sensed through her haze of pleasure. She wondered what Liam not holding back would be like. Delightful thought.</p><p>Sweat trickled down her skin. Liam gripped her waist and rose into her with strong thrusts, sending rivers of pleasure through her body.</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>Liam growled. His eyes moved to white, then snapped back to human blue. He pulled her down to kiss him. Their mouths locked together, and he rolled with her, putting her on her back on the sweat-soaked rug.</p><p>Could anything be better than this? Lying naked on the bathroom floor with a gorgeous, hard-bodied Shifter on top of her?</p><p>Kim lifted her hips to meet his thrusts. They were both panting, both groaning, Liam\u2019s face flushed, eyes half closed. The muscles in his arms and shoulders played as he made love to her, and the mirror across the room showed his fine bu**ocks tightening.</p><p>Kim\u2019s orgasm, when it came, was nothing like she\u2019d ever experienced. The world went away except for the incredible feeling that pierced her where they joined. Nothing mattered, nothing existed, only the two of them, their sweating bodies sealed together and the madness ripping through them.</p><p>Kim\u2019s throat ached, but Liam was quiet as he thrust the final few times.</p><p>\u201cFeel my seed, Kim,\u201d he whispered. \u201cTake it, love.\u201d</p><p>Liquid scalded into her, the se**n of a Shifter. Liam\u2019s mouth covered hers as his hips worked.</p><p>It occurred to Kim that it had gone pretty quiet downstairs when Liam finally collapsed on top of her, panting as though he\u2019d never find his breath again.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>So this was happiness.</p><p>Big-smile-on-his-face, heart-swelling happiness.</p><p>Liam rolled over on the rug again, gathering Kim on top of him. Kim kissed him, her lips soft and warm. Liam had never known such happiness was possible. This was his lady, his mate, the female he\u2019d protect with his life.</p><p>Way down at the bottom of his mind lay fear\u2014he\u2019d seen what had happened to his father and then his brother when they\u2019d lost their mates. Dylan had gone off on his own for a year. Kenny had folded up into himself, not speaking to or looking at anyone for weeks.</p><p>Liam understood their pain now. He\u2019d hurt like hell if he lost Kim. And he\u2019d only known her since yesterday. Right now their happiness was fresh, fragile. Imagine the hurt after years of being together, of learning each other, body and mind. To lose that...</p><p>Liam held her close. She was lush and curvaceous, her sweet br**sts pressing his chest. Any man who\u2019d told her she wasn\u2019t perfect as she was deserved to be shredded.</p><p>Kim looked down at him with a smile. \u201cThat was...Wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow? This is the articulate lawyer talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow about sums it up.\u201d</p><p>He stroked Kim\u2019s hair and kissed her lips. \u201cI\u2019m catching on to this kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need more practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep on teaching me, love.\u201d</p><p>Kim licked his mouth. When she did it again, he caught her tongue with his. He pulled her down for the kiss, lacing his fingers through her hair. He could enjoy these lessons, even when their mouths were raw from lovemaking. He\u2019d make sure he kissed her\u2014real kisses\u2014for the rest of his life.</p><p>Something burbled on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell.\u201d Kim jerked up.</p><p>Liam let her go with reluctance. His reward was watching her crawl to her pants, her backside enticing him as she went. Kim yanked her cell phone out of her pocket and sat up, and now he got to watch her firm, creamy br**sts tipped with dark ni**les. Liam propped himself on his elbow and enjoyed himself.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she said into the phone.</p><p>A man answered, loud enough for Liam to hear him across the room. \u201cHi, honey. How are you?\u201d</p><p>Kim squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cAbel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her eyes popped open again. \u201cWhat are you talking about? You called me.\u201d</p><p>The voice changed to one of tired patience. \u201cLast night, when you called, you sounded like you wanted something. What was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to be tied up all day, all this week, actually, but maybe next Friday I can come over.\u201d</p><p>Maybe? With this woman waiting for him? The man was a thrice-damned idiot.</p><p>\u201cAbel.\u201d Kim gazed into the distance, folding her legs under her. \u201cI won\u2019t be free Friday. In fact...Abel, we need to break up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d The line hummed quietly while her words processed. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m breaking up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Abel sounded baffled. Not hurt, not angry, just puzzled.</p><p>Kim made an impatient noise. \u201cIf you have to ask why, then that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim, honey, you\u2019re not making sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Kim, honey me. I met someone. I didn\u2019t mean to, but it happened. You and I weren\u2019t going anywhere, so I figured, what the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Again, puzzlement instead of anger. \u201cIs it someone in the firm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Like I said, someone I just met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well. I guess I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>Abel clicked off. Kim sat staring, every muscle tense, and then she flung the phone across the room. It landed on the tiles and spun until it hit the big bathtub.</p><p>\u201cTwo years of my life I wasted on him, and all he can say is \u2018See you around\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Liam rolled over and braced himself on both elbows. \u201cHe sounds a bit of a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than a bit.\u201d Kim pressed her hand to her forehead. \u201cDo you know why I went out with him? I just now realized it. Because he would go out with me. No other reason. No compatibility. Convenience, for both of us. I\u2019m pathetic.\u201d</p><p>Liam held out his hand. \u201cYou weren\u2019t pathetic, love. Lonely. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d He wriggled his fingers. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Kim walked to him, no more crawling, until she stood over him. This was the best view of all. Liam roamed his gaze up her tight, petite legs to the slick tuft of hair between them, over her cute navel, her round br**sts and bare neck, ending at her beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mated now,\u201d he said, as Kim knelt on the floor next to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve no more need to be lonely. You have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your ego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me laugh, love. You have me and my father and Sean and Connor. Ellison and Glory. All the Shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven Fergus?\u201d</p><p>Liam grimaced. \u201cHim too. He\u2019s bent out of shape about Brian, and I don\u2019t know why, but usually he\u2019s a fair leader. Mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair? He tried to whip Connor for talking back to him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and it might be hard to understand, but Connor did wrong. He\u2019s a cub. He doesn\u2019t have a place yet, and attacking the clan leader needs punishment. Connor knew that. Any other time, he might have been let off with a warning, but in the middle of a moot, when our family was already in disgrace\u2014Fergus couldn\u2019t let it go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo he whipped you and your father instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny member of a pride has the right to take a punishment for any other, but it has to be voluntary. Dad and I could take the lash; Connor never has. And I wasn\u2019t wrong about Fergus wanting to punish me instead. Connor gave him the excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is one of those Shifter things I don\u2019t understand, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Liam let himself grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it. You\u2019ll get used to all things Shifter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d Kim pulled her knees to her chin, shaping her body into delectable curves and shadows. \u201cWe can\u2019t date right now, Liam. Not until after the case is over and Brian is free. Then, I won\u2019t lie, I wouldn\u2019t mind getting to know you\u2014much better. What we did today will have to be a one-off.\u201d</p><p>Liam laced his fingers through hers. \u201cWe\u2019re not dating, love. We\u2019re bonded for life.\u201d</p><p>Kim gently disengaged her fingers and scooted a few inches away. Liam let her go; this was new to her, and he had to ease her in a bit at a time. \u201cThat\u2019s what it means for Shifters to be mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the human way,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d only be bound to you if I married you. Signed a piece of paper saying so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters aren\u2019t allowed to get marriage licenses. Not under the current laws.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus pronounced us mated, in the Shifter way, under the light of the sun. In a few days, my dad will pronounce it so under the light of the full moon. Then it\u2019s you and me together forever. Because you\u2019re human, I\u2019ll seek a Fae to bond us as well, increasing your lifespan to match mine.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cThink of how many cases you can defend that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Fae can increase lifespan?\u201d Kim\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t everyone out to find a Fae and stay youthful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Fae are bloody elusive to humans, and it only works if the human is bonded to a Shifter. That happens rarely, for obvious reasons, and only the Shifter can seek out the Fae. The Fae have certain obligations to Shifters, as much as they hate it, and this is one favor they grant us if we ask for it. Your natural lifespan will lengthen to match mine. When I grow old and die, so will you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, what if you get hit by a bus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said natural lifespan. It would be like a human relationship but longer.\u201d</p> <p>Kim half smiled, shaking her head as though she thought he was talking nonsense. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works.\u201d</p><p>She still didn\u2019t understand. She would in time, though; Kim wasn\u2019t stupid. And then\u2014she\u2019d kill him.</p><p>\u201cIt is working, love. Anyway, you\u2019ve taken my seed. What will you say to the wee one that comes if you haven\u2019t bound yourself to me? It\u2019ll be embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWee one? Oh, you mean if I have a baby. Don\u2019t worry about that. I take contraceptives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContraceptives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, birth control. I don\u2019t know if Shifters have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it is, Kim.\u201d Humans bred like rabbits, and they were always looking for ways to keep babies from coming. So few Shifter babies were conceived and so few survived that Shifters wouldn\u2019t dream of preventing them. Shifter women knew how dangerous it was to give birth, and yet they sought it with everything they had.</p><p>\u201cI was taking it because I was going out with Abel,\u201d Kim said in reasonable tones. \u201cIt would look bad if he and I had a child together. No, let\u2019s be honest\u2014it would be a hell of a complication if we\u2019d had a child together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if you had one with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Shifter.\u201d</p><p>Liam lay back on his elbows, eyes narrowing. \u201cThis makes a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be offended. If I had a half-Shifter baby, that would be the end of my career. I researched this when I took up Brian\u2019s case, because he was dating a human. There haven\u2019t been many hybrids since you took the Collar, but the woman in question gets shunned by human society every time. In fact, my theory about Michelle\u2019s death is that her ex-boyfriend killed her because she\u2019d betrayed him with Brian, a Shifter. I imagine that made him crazy.\u201d Kim sighed. \u201cProving it is a bitch, though.\u201d</p><p>Liam heaved himself to his feet and stalked to the medicine cabinet over her pristine pedestal sink. He opened it and started pulling out bottles.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>\u201cLooking for your birth control pills. I want to flush them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take pills. I get injections from my doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Kim stood and planted her hands on her naked hips. \u201cHow is this your business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you do is my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, if you want someone to breed little Shifters with you, you have plenty of Shifter women drooling over you. I saw the waitress at the bar\u2014what\u2019s her name?\u2014Annie. She\u2019d have gone to bed with you in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Did Liam dare hope that was jealousy in her eyes? \u201cDid you throw away her contraceptives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Lupine. I told you that the chances of conception in those cases are low, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow lucky for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say lucky like you\u2019d never want a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want one.\u201d Kim threw him an exasperated look. \u201cI like kids. But not right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not with a Shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I decided to pick a Shifter, it would be you.\u201d Kim smiled her beautiful smile. \u201cMaybe later, when I have a solid career, and if you\u2019re still available...\u201d</p><p>Liam moved across the floor and had her in his arms before she could turn away. \u201cUnderstand me, Kim. We are mated. That means I go to no other female unless I lose you to death, and even then it will feel like betrayal. I protect you, I take care of you, I bind myself to you, and you alone.\u201d</p><p>Her face lost color. \u201cThat\u2019s your custom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not custom. It\u2019s Shifter law. It\u2019s magic that runs deep inside us. This mating brings you into my pride. Even Fergus can\u2019t touch you without going through me. That was the point of me claiming you.\u201d</p><p>Kim squirmed away, and Liam let her go.</p><p>\u201cIt was necessary,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t made the Challenge, Fergus would have taken you as mate whether you liked it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he?\u201d Kim asked. \u201cI\u2019m not bound by Shifter law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could because we\u2019re animals. We look like humans and you</p><p>put Collars on us, but we\u2019re born animals and only learn to become human later. The leader of the clan can claim whatever unmated female he wants, and we have to step back and let him unless we want to Challenge. It\u2019s his right. But Fergus is hellaciously strong, and most in the clan don\u2019t want to fight him, so he takes the mates he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not Shifter...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Fergus gives a damn about that? He wants to control you, needs to control what you tell the humans about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d A look of horror moved over Kim\u2019s face. \u201cAre you telling me that if I hadn\u2019t agreed to do this mating thing with you, Fergus might have taken me off and raped me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019d go down for that. A human court would crucify him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould they? Or would they say it was your own fault for hanging out with Shifters? You just said that having a child with me would ruin your career, that you think Michelle died for associating with a Shifter. Shifterwhore is the term.\u201d</p><p>Her face went white, and she sat down hard on the edge of the tub. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Liam came to her, crouched in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, love. I\u2019ll never let Fergus hurt you. Ever. The mate claim overrides clan hierarchy. He can beat up on me, but never you. Even if he kills me, you\u2019ll still be protected by my family, my pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would Fergus still want to kill you?\u201d Kim asked in confusion. \u201cHe seemed to back off all of a sudden, like he didn\u2019t care about the mate thing anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he knew he\u2019d won. He got me to promise to control you, for the good of all Shifters. If he\u2019d pursued it further, for nothing but self-satisfaction, the clan wouldn\u2019t have approved, and even though he\u2019s leader, he can\u2019t afford to lose the clan\u2019s respect. Besides, Dad was there. Fergus has never been one hundred percent certain he\u2019s dominant to Dad, and he didn\u2019t want to put that to the test, especially not in front of the whole clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why doesn\u2019t your dad fight him, then? It\u2019s obvious none of you like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, love, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Liam said, troubled. \u201cDad won\u2019t talk about it. Maybe he knows he isn\u2019t dominant to Fergus, and if Dad were killed, he couldn\u2019t protect the rest of us from him. But I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s never said and gets pissed off when anyone brings it up.\u201d</p><p>Kim frowned, rubbing her arms. \u201cBut when Fergus came at me with the whip and you almost attacked him, Dylan stopped you, said it wasn\u2019t your \u2018right.\u2019 What did he mean? I thought you were supposed to fight.\u201d</p><p>Liam remembered the surge of adrenaline rising white hot, searing him like a brand on flesh, when he\u2019d seen Fergus focus on Kim. Only Dylan\u2019s harsh voice had stopped him from making a fatal move, or this day would have ended differently.</p><p>\u201cBecause at that moment, I wanted to kill him. The Fae-cat in me wanted to go after Fergus in a clan dominance fight, to take him down for good. The mate Challenge isn\u2019t to the death\u2014at least, not anymore\u2014but fighting for clan leadership usually is, unless the clan leader surrenders before the fight. Dad stopped me from making it a clan dominance issue, thank the Goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It seems like you could have saved him a step.\u201d She let out her breath. \u201cNot that I want to see you in a fight to the death. I\u2019m happy he stopped you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifter politics.\u201d Liam tried to sound offhand, but something subtle had changed during the moot today, and he wasn\u2019t yet certain what. \u201cOnly Dad, as pride leader, has the right to fight for clan dominance. If I want to take out Fergus, I first have to take out Dad, and I won\u2019t be doing that anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>Kim gave him a faint smile. \u201cBecause you know he could kick your ass?\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed. \u201cNo, because he\u2019s my dad, and I love him.\u201d Another laugh. \u201cAnd yeah, he could probably kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>Kim hugged her chest. \u201cI thought I researched Shifter law down to the last degree. I don\u2019t remember any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not written law. It\u2019s passed down through the generations, and it\u2019s based on instinct and what you call custom.\u201d Liam laid his hands on her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated even for us. I\u2019m going to protect you, Kim. Believe that.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him with anguished eyes. \u201cLiam, I can\u2019t be your mate. I only came to Shiftertown to get help building my defense for Brian. I\u2019m fine with you keeping Fergus off my back, but I can\u2019t move into your house to become a Shifter baby-making machine. You\u2019re crazy if you believe I\u2019ll agree to that.\u201d</p><p>He traced circles on her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019d never believe you\u2019d do anything you don\u2019t really want to, Kim Fraser.\u201d</p><p>Kim broke his hold, got to her feet, and reached for her clothes. \u201cYou got that right.\u201d She pulled on her jeans in short jerks. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll take your family and go home, I really have a lot of work to do. I\u2019m seriously behind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and stared at him. \u201cYou agree? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me \u2018love.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>Liam chuckled. \u201cNow that, I can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>He watched Kim\u2019s br**sts softly bounce as she scrabbled for the rest of her clothes. He wouldn\u2019t push her now\u2014she was human, this was sudden, and it would take her time to get used to him. But Kim was his. His mate, his lover.</p><p>All mine.</p><p>She finished dressing and hurried out of the bathroom. Liam followed, not bothering with his clothes. He paused on the landing to watch her hips sway as she ran lightly down the stairs.</p><p>As angry and confused and hurt as she was\u2014and as likely to make his life hell\u2014Kim glowed with beauty. Her body was covered with Liam\u2019s scent, filled with their lovemaking. Beautiful, beautiful Kim.</p> <p>Liam went down the stairs after Kim. Below him, she stopped abruptly, noting that the TV was dark, the living room quiet. Sean and Connor looked at her with innocent faces.</p><p>Connor grinned. \u201cEverything all right up there? I thought the ceiling might come crashing in.\u201d</p><p>Kim flushed. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dylan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone,\u201d Sean said. \u201cTook the bus back to Shiftertown. Dad does his own thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, clearly flustered. \u201cI can call a taxi for the rest of you.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cNo need. Dad said he\u2019d be back to fetch us.\u201d</p> <p>Connor lost his smile. \u201cAren\u2019t you coming home with us, Kim?\u201d</p><p>Poor cub. He liked Kim, was ecstatic about the mating, and probably assumed Kim would instantly become one of them. Connor had much to learn about females.</p><p>\u201cNow that Liam says Fergus is no longer a threat, I\u2019m going to stay in my own home,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind helping out today, and thank you for the pancakes, but I\u2019m kind of tired and have a lot of work to do.\u201d</p><p>Liam shifted. His Fae-cat didn\u2019t wait for him to ready himself, and for the first time in his life, the shift didn\u2019t hurt. He leapt off the bottom step, the stairs creaking under his weight, and he tackled Kim. His big, sheathed paws sent her to the ground, and he landed on top of her, balancing so he wouldn\u2019t crush her.</p><p>In this form he could truly smell her, and she was better than the best field of blossoms. She combined her scent and his in perfect proportion, the sign of a perfect mate.</p><p>Kim tried to squirm out from under him. \u201cLiam, what are you doing? Someone get this big cat off me.\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t mind her wriggling while his brother and nephew laughed at them. He swiped her face from chin to forehead with his large tongue, shifting back to human form as she turned her head and cried, \u201cEeewwww.\u201d</p><p>Incredibly, Liam did leave with his family, and Kim found herself alone in the house. She\u2019d expected Liam to stay on his overprotective kick and insist she come back with them to Shiftertown for the night. Or maybe move his whole family to her house so they could watch satellite TV, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p> <p>But Liam had gone back upstairs, put on his clothes, and herded Connor and Sean out through the garage just as Dylan pulled a big pickup into her driveway. As the others piled in, Liam slid his arms around Kim and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cYou rest now,\u201d he said, smoothing her hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s lips tingled and she wanted more, but she made herself step back. \u201cI\u2019m going to work in the morning. I\u2019m not dropping the case, whatever Fergus might think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Liam lifted her hand and kissed her palm. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be yourself if you dropped it. But as you like to say, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Kim suddenly, inconsistently, didn\u2019t want him to leave.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Liam brushed another warm kiss to her lips and walked out. Kim resisted the urge to rush after him, to tell him to come back, to beg him to stay.</p><p>What was the matter with her? Liam and his family had imprisoned her in Shiftertown, and then she\u2019d driven them a hundred or so miles to the middle of nowhere so she could endure the abuse of Fergus the Irish biker thug.</p><p>Then why did her heart ache as the pickup backed away, all four Morrissey men squished into the cab? Liam must have brainwashed her with his fine blue eyes and incredible smile, not to mention intense, mind-blowing sex.</p><p>As Kim closed the door, the emptiness of the house pressed on her. The TV was dark and quiet, no male voices raised in jubilation. She stood in the middle of the living room and felt the silence.</p><p>Kim went through the rest of the afternoon on automatic. She showered, trying not to gaze at the rug where she\u2019d ridden Liam so ecstatically. The tactile memory of his body on hers, of every finger press, every kiss, every slide of skin on skin was imprinted on her. Kim had never had sex like that in her life.</p><p>In a half daze she drove down the hill to her local grocery store. She found herself putting things in her cart that wouldn\u2019t have occurred to her a few days ago\u2014steaks, ground beef, potato chips, and Guinness stout. Why? she wondered as she paid without meeting the cashier\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to invite them over again. But just in case...</p><p>Kim took the food home and crammed everything into the refrigerator. She fixed herself a salad that she picked at, and then she opened her briefcase and laptop and flipped listlessly through files.</p><p>She needed to get her head around all this\u2014Brian, the Collars, Fergus, this mating thing. She reread a note from her friend Silas asking Kim whether she could get him an interview with the Shifter leaders. Silas was a good, evenhanded journalist who didn\u2019t shrink from bald truth but didn\u2019t make something out of nothing either. Two days ago, she\u2019d have eagerly set up an interview for him. Given what she knew now, she wasn\u2019t so sure it was a good idea, or if Liam would even agree to talk to him.</p><p>On the other hand, everything that had happened today helped Kim look at Brian\u2019s case from a new angle. Had Brian intended to make Michelle his mate? If so, wouldn\u2019t he have been as protective of her as Liam was of Kim? If Brian had decided to \u201cclaim\u201d Michelle, that might mean he\u2019d never dream of hurting her. Wouldn\u2019t he have done everything in his power to keep her safe?</p><p>Michelle\u2019s ex-boyfriend, on the other hand, might go ballistic. Brian, a Shifter, would be hard to kill, but not Michelle. And if Brian could get blamed for Michelle\u2019s death, so much the better.</p><p>Then again, why hadn\u2019t Brian been there to protect his girlfriend from her killer? Where had he been and what had he been doing to keep him from Michelle at the critical moment?</p><p>Kim sighed and rubbed her temples. She was getting nowhere.</p><p>After an hour or so of trying to think and failing, Kim went to bed. Mistake. She should have been exhausted after rolling on the bathroom floor with Liam, but instead she was wide awake, her pulse speeding as their lovemaking played over and over in her mind.</p><p>She\u2019d never, ever felt like this before. Kim should be sated after</p><p>that incredible sex, but she wanted more of Liam. And more.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter with me?\u201d</p><p>She sat up and snapped on the light. Three seconds later, her phone rang.</p><p>Kim picked it up, her heart pounding as Liam\u2019s rich Irish tones rolled over her. \u201cKim. You all right?\u201d</p><p>Kim wanted to sigh with happiness. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am fine.\u201d She lay back down on the pillows, feeling warm and content. \u201cReally. Really, really fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He sounded as though it was the best news he\u2019d heard all day.</p><p>Kim hesitated. \u201cHow\u2019s Connor doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not happy with me, but he\u2019ll be all right. Letting him watch Irish football has made you his superhero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re glad.\u201d</p><p>Kim wondered if Liam was in bed talking to her, if he was stretched, naked, on top of the bed she\u2019d slept in last night. Her heart beat faster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my office tomorrow.\u201d She said it firmly.</p><p>\u201cI know you are. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to do anything else.\u201d Liam\u2019s voice softened. \u201cGood night, love. You call me anytime you need me, all right?\u201d</p><p>He meant it\u2014his sincerity came through loud and clear. All she had to do was say, Liam, I need you, and he\u2019d be there. So different from Abel and his I\u2019m busy, honey, I\u2019ll call you later.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Liam.\u201d Kim made herself click the phone off and set it on the nightstand, but it was a long time before she snapped off the light.</p><p>Outside Kim\u2019s big house, Liam tucked away his phone and kissed his fingers to her bedroom window. He faded into the shadows against the wall and settled in to guard her for the rest of the night.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The next morning Kim raced her car into her parking space at Lowell, Grant, and Steinhurst, half an hour late.</p><p>Late. On a Monday. Missing the Monday morning meeting. Kim scrambled out of her car, snatched up her briefcase, rushed for the front door, and stopped in dismay.</p><p>Liam leaned against the Harley he\u2019d parked at the curb in front of the firm\u2019s walkway, smiling his wicked smile.</p><p>\u201cMorning, love,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Kim demanded.</p><p>\u201cLooking after you. Like I should.\u201d</p><p>July sunshine gleamed on Liam\u2019s dark hair and flat black sunglasses. With his black T-shirt and jeans, Collar around his neck, his jaw working as he chewed a piece of gum, he looked nothing less than a dangerous Shifter male. Which he was.</p><p>She made an exasperated noise. \u201cLiam, I cannot bring a Shifter to work with me.\u201d</p><p>Liam lifted his sunglasses, blue eyes dancing. \u201cI don\u2019t see any signs: \u2018No Shifters Allowed.\u2019 \u2018Shifters Must Keep Off the Grass.\u2019 \u2018Absolutely No Territory Marking Anywhere.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. Go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He lowered the sunglasses and took her elbow. \u201cIf you work here, I stay with you. I\u2019m your guard dog. You won\u2019t even know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no one will notice a six-foot-six Shifter in my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying, Kim. Or you\u2019re coming home with me. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>She jerked from his grasp. \u201cYou\u2019re a pushy pain in my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking a chance that Fergus will leave you alone. He can\u2019t touch you anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t order other Shifters to make trouble for you. Some of Fergus\u2019s lackeys are...Let\u2019s just say they\u2019re fanatically devoted to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all are crazy, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged. \u201cHey, you\u2019re the Shifter lover, which means you\u2019re crazier than we are. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Liam opened the heavy glass door and, Shifter-fashion, entered the building first. Once he determined that the polished granite and marble foyer was harmless, he nodded for Kim to come inside.</p><p>Kim knew of nothing that could make him leave, short of having him arrested, and even then the police would have to break out the tranquilizer guns. She also knew that, deep down inside, she didn\u2019t want him to leave. Kim didn\u2019t trust Fergus either, and Liam\u2019s presence made her feel safe. Embarrassed, awkward, and confused, but safe.</p><p>As they moved through the plush halls, lawyers looked up through open doors or stepped into the hall in astonishment. Liam nodded at the head of the firm who\u2019d stopped short in his doorway. \u201cTop o\u2019 the morning to you.\u201d</p><p>Kim scuttled into her office suite where the secretary, Jeanne, who worked for Kim and two other lawyers, typed on a computer keyboard. Jeanne looked up, gawked, and lost her place. \u201cWho the hell...?\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cTop o\u2019 the mornin\u2019 to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Kim said in a hard voice. \u201cHe\u2019s helping me on the Shifter case.\u201d</p><p>Jeanne looked as though she\u2019d melt through her chair. \u201cCan I get you coffee?\u201d she offered Liam in an eager tone.</p><p>\u201cCoffee would be grand,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kim grabbed Liam\u2019s arm, shoved him into her cluttered office, and slammed the door behind them. She pointed at the leather couch wedged between two bookcases.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re staying\u2014sit.\u201d</p><p>Liam grinned, removed his sunglasses, stretched out full length on the couch, and folded his arms behind his head. He looked good enough to eat.</p><p>Kim slapped her briefcase to her desk and popped it open. \u201cWhat is this \u2018top o\u2019 the morning\u2019 crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s how people expect the Irish to talk. That and \u2018faith and begorra!\u2019 I\u2019ll throw those in later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so full of shit.\u201d</p> <p>Liam chuckled and closed his eyes. He looked prepared to lounge there the rest of the day, reminding her every second of their thorough sexing in her bathroom. She\u2019d dreamed about it all night, the main reason she\u2019d been late. When he\u2019d rolled her over and driven into her, his warm weight on top of her, she\u2019d never felt more connected or intimate with a man in her life. She\u2019d felt...complete.</p><p>Forget the goopy, romantic stuff. The sex had been damn fantastic.</p><p>Kim had to stop thinking about it. She had to be professional and do her job. She had other cases to prepare for, a load of witness statements and evidence reports to go through. Brian\u2019s defense to figure out, the private investigator\u2019s weekend reports to read.</p><p>Once she won Brian\u2019s case, she\u2019d be finished with Shifters. Fergus\u2019s wishes would be a moot point, Liam wouldn\u2019t need to guard her anymore, and he\u2019d go back to Shiftertown and leave her alone. For good.</p><p>Why did the world suddenly go colorless at that thought?</p><p>Kim dumped files back into her briefcase. \u201cI need to talk to Brian. I assume you want to come with me? We\u2019ll take my car\u2014I\u2019m not riding to the county jail on the back of your motorcycle.\u201d</p> <p>Liam didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see Brian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to. I want to ask him about Michelle again, whether he planned to mate with her, whether he already did. If Brian thought of her as his mate, he\u2019d never have hurt her, right? He\u2019d come over all protective, defend her rather than attack her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be right about that, but you\u2019re still not going to see him.\u201d</p><p>Kim clicked the briefcase shut. \u201cWhy not? He\u2019s in jail. He\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Liam finally came off the couch. \u201cYou\u2019re not going because Fergus told you to drop the case.\u201d</p><p>He was a tall, solid wall, blocking her way to the door. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this. I say screw Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I hear it\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t laugh. \u201cSo you agree with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Liam rested his hands on her shoulders. She\u2019d never get by him, and she knew it. At the same time, she knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. He\u2019d prevent her from leaving, but not by hurting.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you saying?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat Fergus won\u2019t trust me to keep you off the case. I was the one who talked him into letting you come to Shiftertown in the first place. So he\u2019ll have sent his own men to watch you, to stop you. I\u2019m here to keep them from tangling with you. If you go to the jail, there will be tangling.\u201d</p><p>Kim made a noise of exasperation. \u201cExplain how I\u2019m supposed to defend a man I\u2019m not allowed to talk to. I need to ask him questions, important questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him some other way.\u201d</p><p>Kim tried to dart around him. Liam put one arm out and hauled her back against him.</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>He closed both arms around her and pulled her close. \u201cDo this my way, love. Don\u2019t mess with Fergus more than you have to. He\u2019ll make you regret it.\u201d</p><p>Kim wanted to succumb to the wonderful, protected feeling of having his arms around her. Even her parents hadn\u2019t been this protective of her. After Mark had died, they\u2019d wavered between being overly paranoid about her safety to backing way off when they realized they were smothering her.</p><p>They\u2019d gone on like that until they\u2019d died. She\u2019d found herself alternately on a choke chain or floundering during her parents\u2019 \u201cyou don\u2019t even have to check in with us\u201d moods.</p><p>Liam\u2019s protection was like a soft blanket, not a leash, but the tether was there nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t work like this,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a way.\u201d Liam kissed the crown of her head.</p><p>The warm touch of his lips electrified the memories of their lovemaking, reminding her that her throat was still scratchy from all the screaming. She couldn\u2019t help putting her hand on his waistband and sliding her fingers downward, her pulse speeding when she found that he was hard and hot behind his zipper.</p><p>Liam laughed. \u201cVixen.\u201d He tilted her head back and kissed her.</p><p>Liam was still learning how to kiss. Which meant he experimented and explored, his tongue sliding all over hers while he gripped her bu**ocks with one firm hand. He tasted like the gum he\u2019d been chewing, minty fresh.</p><p>If anyone came in, they\u2019d see his sun-browned hand planted against her gray business skirt, Kim letting a Shifter put his tongue down her throat. And they wouldn\u2019t know the half of it.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>A gentle kiss to her forehead. \u201cI\u2019d never hurt you, Kim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pain I\u2019m worried about.\u201d Kim rested her head against his chest. His skin was hot through the shirt, his heart pounding at breakneck speed. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I mean. You are seriously damaging my mental health.\u201d</p><p>Liam broke away, but he was smiling. \u201cYou mean I make you spare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that means crazy, then yes. That too.\u201d</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door, and Jeanne poked her head in. She carried in a tray of coffee, in real mugs, not Styrofoam cups. Kim turned from Liam, hoping she looked nonchalant.</p><p>Jeanne set the coffee on the polished side table. \u201cAbel is looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbel?\u201d For one crazy moment, Kim couldn\u2019t remember who he was. Ah, yes, buttoned-up, executive ex-boyfriend. The man who looked incredibly boring next to Liam. \u201cWhat does he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ask you about the judge you had on that indecent exposure case. He\u2019s got a similar case before the same judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Business. Tips on what swayed a judge or pissed him off. Kim had won the case, because the man they\u2019d arrested had had erectile dysfunction, verified by a doctor, when the witness had sworn the defendant had been quite, um, pointed. \u201cSet up a meeting with Abel,\u201d Kim finished. \u201cI\u2019m busy until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here now.\u201d</p><p>Before Kim could answer, Abel Kane pushed around the door and strode into the office. Kim had always thought him good-looking\u2014tall, blond, well-dressed\u2014but he was a lightweight compared to Liam. And there was no comparison at all in the sex department.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t this wait?\u201d Kim asked him.</p><p>Abel was looking at Liam in curiosity. \u201cKind of in a rush.\u201d</p><p>Liar. He couldn\u2019t be paid to care about indecent-exposure cases; he\u2019d used the excuse to come in here and eyeball Liam.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Kim asked in an annoyed voice. \u201cClient can\u2019t keep his pants on?\u201d</p><p>Abel ignored her attempt at humor. \u201cSo the Collars really do fit all Shifters. What neck size would you say he has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can hear you, Abel.\u201d</p><p>Liam gave Abel his slow smile. \u201cTop o\u2019 the morning to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop that?\u201d Kim snapped.</p><p>\u201cIs he Irish?\u201d Abel said in surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Shifters could be Irish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Shifters in my family go back generations in Ireland,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWe had a castle on a hill and everything.\u201d</p><p>Abel continued to assess Liam like a scientist examining an interesting specimen. \u201cType up a report on him,\u201d Abel said to Kim. \u201cIt would be useful if we ever have to defend another Shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbel, will you please stop talking about him like he\u2019s not in the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s eating you, Kim? Is it the new guy you met or your time of the month?\u201d</p><p>What an idiot. Abel hadn\u2019t connected Kim \u201cmeeting someone\u201d with the extremely virile Shifter standing in her office. Abel couldn\u2019t imagine for one second that she\u2019d dump him for a Shifter.</p><p>Liam\u2019s grin died. He\u2019d been taking Abel for what he really was, a self-centered moron, but Liam\u2019s eyes narrowed at Abel\u2019s last statement. The predatory thing Liam did so well came out, proving that up until now, he\u2019d been a wolf watching the sheep frolic.</p><p>\u201cThe lady said she\u2019s busy.\u201d Liam\u2019s voice held a hint of growl.</p><p>Without moving, Liam gained the attention of everyone in the room, plus Jeanne listening outside the door. A sheen of perspiration glistened on Abel\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ll call you later, Kim. About that judge.\u201d</p><p>Abel couldn\u2019t turn around to walk out. Liam wouldn\u2019t let him. And yet, Liam did nothing but stand there, not moving, not touching the man. He hadn\u2019t even let his pupils go slitted.</p><p>Abel had to back to the door, one step at a time, before he finally turned and fled. He ran into Jeanne, who was plastered solidly against the crack in the door. They tangled a moment; then Abel fled and Jeanne slammed the door, leaving Kim and Liam alone again.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Kim took Liam out for lunch. Liam enjoyed riding in her small car, watching her gray businesslike skirt riding up her thighs. As he\u2019d guessed, she wore stockings with lacy tops, held in place by garters. Thinking about skimming off the skirt and looking at her in only the garter belt and stockings didn\u2019t do his rising erection any favors.</p><p>What deflated his arousal was being turned away by the first restaurant they reached. The hostess took one look at Liam\u2019s Collar and got the manager.</p><p>Kim stormed away, furious, but Liam didn\u2019t know why she was surprised. Shifters hadn\u2019t been welcomed in most places for twenty years.</p><p>The next two restaurants wouldn\u2019t let them in, either. They ended up at a greasy spoon close to the north Austin Shiftertown, where the owners had figured out that Shifters paid for the food and didn\u2019t cause trouble, unlike the gang kids that roamed the nearby neighborhoods.</p><p>\u201cHow can you stand it?\u201d Kim fumed as she dumped sugar into her coffee. \u201cI never realized how blatant it was.\u201d</p><p>Liam blew on his coffee to cool it before he sipped. \u201cBans against Shifters? If you never witnessed it firsthand, I\u2019m guessing you frequent places Shifters don\u2019t even bother trying to go to. But it doesn\u2019t much matter to me where I go. I don\u2019t really want to eat at a place where they don\u2019t serve Shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being so blas\u00e9. They treat you like animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim, sweetheart, I\u2019ve lived a hundred years under various and sometimes nasty conditions. This life isn\u2019t so bad. There are certain people I keep out of my bar too. I\u2019d ban Lupines altogether, except Ellison and Glory would try to wipe the floor with my butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Liam looked straight into her blue eyes, trying to calm her rage. He liked her anger, though, because it meant she cared. \u201cThe way people treat Shifters can be amusing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDiscrimination is never funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a righteous woman, Kim. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you just sit there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI usually sit when I\u2019m drinking coffee. Or I lean against something. If I lie on my back, it goes down the wrong way.\u201d Kim started to rage, and Liam reached over and took her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love. I\u2019m glad you care so much. It\u2019s sweet. But I\u2019m not bothered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you not be bothered to have people walk all over you? Abel acted like you were behind a viewing wall in a zoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they don\u2019t walk all over me.\u201d He glanced around, but they were relatively alone in their corner of the restaurant. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever let them. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Liam lifted his coffee again. \u201cNeither does Fergus. That\u2019s why he chose the Shiftertown out in the desert. He can\u2019t stand for anyone to bruise his ego.\u201d</p><p>Kim sat in silence, running her finger around the rim of her cup. She spoke carefully, as though she had to choose each word. \u201cWhat you mean is, you don\u2019t get upset when they won\u2019t let you into restaurants or forbid you having cable, because those things aren\u2019t important to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, you\u2019re catching on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Abel doesn\u2019t bother you because you don\u2019t value his opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. On the other hand, he says anything nasty like that to you again, I\u2019ll crush him.\u201d</p><p>Kim had a sudden vision of a lion lying on a veldt in complete relaxation, swatting an obnoxious fly with his tail. The fly had Abel\u2019s head. The same lion would have cubs climbing all over him, which he\u2019d turn and greet with a lick.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like we live in a different world from you,\u201d Kim said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t even know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p> <p>The look she gave him was stunned. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, love.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIf last night was a pity f**k, I\u2019m all for them.\u201d</p><p>She turned bright red. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t. And don\u2019t talk about sex while I\u2019m trying to get my head straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about doing more than talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She pressed her palms flat on the table. \u201cWhen you do that, I can\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. Thinking, it\u2019s an overrated activity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, where does Fergus get all his money?\u201d</p><p>Liam managed to look blank. \u201cDoes Fergus have money?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know he does. There\u2019s that underground complex for one, and all that artwork for another. It didn\u2019t spring there overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters live a long time, and some are good with money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Shifters aren\u2019t supposed to have much money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Liam took a calming sip of coffee. Trust Kim to pry at their most basic secrets, leaving Liam to have to think of ways of explaining. He didn\u2019t want to lie, not to the woman he\u2019d chosen as mate, but at the same time she wanted to rip the lid off everything they desperately needed to keep protected.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think we live, sweetheart?\u201d he asked her, keeping his voice down. \u201cWe\u2019re only allowed low-wage jobs, and yet we\u2019re expected to feed our families, pay the rent. You don\u2019t think I live on what I make as a part-time bar manager, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did notice you had a casual attitude about going to work. As in, you never go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have the job. So the human committees can mark down on their sheets that I have employment and be happy that they\u2019ve done well by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do have money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow then, Kim, a man would think you didn\u2019t want him for his looks and his fine personality.\u201d</p><p>Kim flushed again. \u201cYou obviously don\u2019t want me prying, but you expect me to be your mate\u2014for life\u2014without explaining what\u2019s really going on with you.\u201d</p><p>Liam laid his hand lightly over hers. \u201cI was teasing. Let\u2019s just say my family is provided for. As will be my mate and my offspring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffspring. Now we\u2019re back in dangerous territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought all women would want to know that their mate can take care of the cubs. But all right.\u201d Liam withdrew his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about Brian.\u201d</p><p>Kim looked surprised at the change of subject. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s talk about why Fergus doesn\u2019t want me to save him. Why he wants Brian to plead guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew, love. Brian\u2019s no threat to Fergus, nowhere near challenging for leadership. Fergus has helped Brian and his family in the past. They aren\u2019t close, but not enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Brian pissed him off somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he did, I never heard about it. I would have heard.\u201d It bothered him that he knew little of what had gone on between Brian and Fergus. Liam had always thought he had his finger firmly on the pulse of Shiftertown. He knew everyone, and they knew him. If a Shifter were in trouble, someone would tell him or Sean. That was the way it worked. In Brian\u2019s case, it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Kim said, \u201cWhen I first came to see you, you told me you didn\u2019t know much about Brian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to put you off. A human poking around in Shiftertown is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you took me to see his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked you.\u201d That liking was growing into something far deeper, perilously deeper. The joy that flashed through him every time he saw Kim\u2019s beautiful eyes and sassy smile grew stronger each day. The thought should dismay him, yet it didn\u2019t.</p><p>Mating could start off as nothing more than a drive to reproduce, and some Shifters never moved beyond that. But others, like his father and mother, his brother Kenny and mate Sinead, had developed a relationship that went beyond mating, even beyond love. It was a bond humans couldn\u2019t understand, and Liam felt it forging between himself and Kim.</p><p>It was a heady feeling, and one he feared would turn into worse pain than any he\u2019d ever experienced. The Collar\u2019s torture would be nothing compared to Kim breaking his heart.</p><p>Kim frowned at her coffee. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that now that I have good questions to ask Brian, you won\u2019t let me near him. You\u2019re not making my job easy.\u201d She looked up, an idea lighting her eyes. \u201cBut wait a sec, I can\u2019t believe Fergus wouldn\u2019t let Brian\u2019s mother talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. Clan rules are one thing; maternal ties are another. Sacred, you could say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way Fergus can\u2019t mess with me if I\u2019m your mate.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cHe can\u2019t unless I let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him? What\u2019s all this \u2018let\u2019 shit? Shifters don\u2019t understand the term \u2018feminism,\u2019 do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that, love. Shifter females are no pushovers. But realize that Shifters have lived in small groups for thousands of years, the males protecting the females and the cubs. It\u2019s instinctive for us. This is the first time we\u2019ve dwelled in close communities\u2014we still had the clans, but we rarely saw others in our clan. It\u2019s taking us a little bit of time to adjust.\u201d</p><p>She watched him in curiosity, one finger still rubbing the rim of her cup. Liam thought about her sweeping the same finger over his c**k and instantly got hard again.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you live before?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean in Ireland, before you came to Shiftertown? You told Abel you had a castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA castle. That we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith battlements and everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was mostly a ruin by the time we moved in, but we fixed it up and made it livable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the Irish think of you? This was before Shifters came out, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they had all kinds of explanations for us. The ones inclined to believe in ghost stories thought we were the Fae, and that wasn\u2019t far off. Lucky for them, Shifters are ten times kinder than the Fae. Others thought we were former IRA come to hide out. The more skeptical just said we were crazy. But everyone knew we kept the village protected, so no one tried to drive us out.\u201d</p><p>Kim was watching him now, a bit like her office colleagues had, but Liam didn\u2019t mind so much being subjected to her blue-eyed scrutiny. \u201cWhy did you come to Austin if you had a fine castle in Ireland, and everyone loved you?\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged. \u201cOnce the traitorous bastard Shifter in England sold his story and demonstrated that he could shape-shift, Ireland got a little dangerous for us. People who needed money started taking bounties on Shifters, dead or alive. Kenny\u2019s mate, Sinead, was pregnant, and we couldn\u2019t risk her getting hunted. We heard that in this country, Shifters were being herded into camps rather than exterminated, but allowed to live in safety. So we packed up, and here we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Sinead\u2014Connor\u2019s mom\u2014died anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she did.\u201d The sadness of her death had never gone away. \u201cBut if we\u2019d stayed in Ireland, we\u2019d likely have lost Connor too. He came early and was so weak. He needed quiet and medical care. Here, me and Dad, Sean and Kenny, we were able to look after him without having to worry about fighting off villagers with pitchforks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that you took the Collar to save him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then a feral Shifter killed Kenny.\u201d Kim\u2019s eyes flashed with rage. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s heart warmed at her anger. She understood. \u201cMay hell rot all feral Shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFerals are the ones who refused the Collar, right? Why do they kill other Shifters?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s deep anger stirred. \u201cBecause in their eyes, we betrayed them. Instead of waiting to get slaughtered or watching our children die, we chose to sacrifice our freedom and band together. What infuriates them most is that we now live with other species of Shifters\u2014which, to ferals, is even worse than letting humans believe they tell us what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafety in numbers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd strength.\u201d Liam smiled. \u201cWhen we buried our cross-species hatred, we got stronger. We helped each other instead of fighting. Shifters were scattered and dying out. Now we\u2019re growing in number again. And growing stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me that Shiftertowns aren\u2019t so much places of captivity as they are fortresses? No matter what humans think they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say sanctuaries, but you\u2019re not far from wrong.\u201d He lost his smile. \u201cDo you understand now why Fergus doesn\u2019t want a human learning all our secrets?\u201d</p><p>Kim glanced around, but still, no one had come to sit near them. The coffee shop was pretty much deserted, the lunch crowd not yet surging through Austin\u2019s streets. \u201cThen why are you telling me?\u201d</p><p>A nonchalant shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re my mate. I tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do. You\u2019re saying that you live in Shiftertowns for your own ends and that you don\u2019t care about the things humans keep you from having\u2014like cable and new cars and high-paying jobs. I sort of understand that. But the Collars are still cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. Invented by a half-Fae with no love for Shifters. The truth is Shifters weren\u2019t all that violent in the wild. We used to hunt animals to eat\u2014now we get our meat from the supermarket. But then, same with humans. We fight among ourselves for dominance or to protect the pride, but no indiscriminate slaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis from a man who killed a Shifter in my bedroom and was about to battle his clan leader yesterday morning.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cExtenuating circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are supposed to hate other Shifter species?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve learned to suppress our prejudices for the health of us all. Mostly. I count Ellison my friend, but I can still call him dog breath.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kim\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cWhat does he call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat shit.\u201d</p><p>She burst into nervous laughter. \u201cI thought it would be \u2018Hairball.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory calls us that sometimes. That or \u2018Cock-sucking Feline Irish bastards\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Her brows rose. \u201cAnd your father sleeps with this woman?\u201d</p><p>The relationship between Glory and Dylan was unexplainable. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see him take an interest,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI give him a break. He lost his mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Liam didn\u2019t fight his memories of his mother anymore. He had for a long time, not wanting to examine the hole in his heart. Dylan\u2019s taking off for a year had, in retrospect, been a good thing, even though at the time Liam had been furious with his father. But he realized now that Dylan had needed room to grieve, and Sean, Liam, and Kenny had needed to figure out how to live without a guiding hand.</p><p>\u201cShe was a fine woman,\u201d Liam said softly. \u201cBeautiful, with green eyes and red hair. The wildcat she turned into was amazing\u2014graceful and deadly\u2014you didn\u2019t mess with her. She and Dad loved each other so much, it got embarrassing sometimes. You\u2019d walk into a room, and they\u2019d be kissing, with their hands all over each other. Imagine. At their age.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a hard time thinking of your dad as old. Yes, I know you told me he\u2019s like two hundred. Do all Shifters age so well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t die young, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo many die young?\u201d</p><p>She was asking painful questions again. \u201cThey do. Or at least they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother reason you took the Collar.\u201d</p><p>Three people sat down in the booth behind them, humans, who must have been used to Shifters, because they didn\u2019t look too nervous. Liam changed the subject. \u201cI should talk to Sandra on my own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWant me to drive you? Before I head back to my office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now. After you get off work tonight.\u201d Liam pushed aside his coffee cup and stood, reaching to help her to her feet. \u201cAnd after we stop by your house and get the things you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to spend the night with you again?\u201d</p><p>Kim said it a little too loudly. The diners in the next booth looked around, startled, curious, knowing.</p><p>\u201cI meant at your house,\u201d Kim amended. \u201cI don\u2019t need to stay there. I have my own house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my nephew will be heartbroken if you don\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>She gave him her annoyed look. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d She spun on her high heels and marched to the door, her sexy ass moving provocatively.</p><p>Liam took money from his pocket and dropped it on the table, thinking he could watch Kim\u2019s fine backside all day and never get tired of it. And after the day was done, he could lie next to her and her fine backside all night. He\u2019d not get tired of that, either.</p> <p>Kim decided she\u2019d never have let Liam win the argument of her returning with him to Shiftertown that evening if she hadn\u2019t spied the shaved-headed Shifter from San Antonio sitting at a bus stop outside her house. He wore a turtleneck to cover his Collar\u2014in this heat, what an idiot\u2014but she recognized him and knew he wasn\u2019t waiting for any bus.</p><p>The thought of Liam leaving her alone in the house while Fergus\u2019s Thug Number One lurked outside made her cold with worry. Ironic, Kim thought as she drove through the city, heading back toward Shiftertown, that she felt safer in a house full of Shifters with a crazed woman next door than in her own neighborhood. Everything about her life since she\u2019d met Liam was upside down.</p><p>Shiftertown was as lively as ever as she followed Liam on his bike through it. Kids were being called in from playing to have dinner. Kim smelled barbeques firing up and burgers on the grill. Men and women alike looked up as Kim\u2019s Mustang rolled past. Liam, ahead of her, sexy on his Harley, lifted his hand in greeting time and again.</p><p>Liam\u2019s yard was quiet, no barbeque going here. Kim wondered whose turn it was to cook and hoped the men inside hadn\u2019t decided it was hers. But something seemed wrong; the door was shut too tightly, the windows too dark.</p><p>Liam sensed it too, stepping silently in front of her as they went up the porch steps. He opened the door to reveal Dylan and Sean in the living room, facing each other in livid anger, their eyes feral white. Connor huddled in the kitchen, as far away from the other two as he could get and still be downstairs.</p><p>Liam\u2019s voice was very quiet as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble, Sean?\u201d</p><p>Sean swung from Dylan, his body so tight with rage Kim wondered that he didn\u2019t flow into his wildcat form. Claws extended from his fingers as he grabbed a paper from the table and shoved it in Liam\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the trouble.\u201d</p><p>It was a printed e-mail. Kim rose on tiptoe to read it with Liam.</p><p>After the mate-bonding at the full moon, it has been decided by clan council that Dylan Morrissey shall step down as leader of the East Austin Shiftertown and another Feline of the council\u2019s choosing be put into his place. Authorized by Fergus Leary, leader of the South Texas Feline clan.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Kim had never seen Liam less than completely self-assured, never at a loss for words. Not her Irish Shifter with his gift of blarney.</p><p>Now Liam stared at the paper while his face flooded with color and his eyes changed to white-blue.</p><p>\u201cI told Dad\u201d\u2014Sean\u2019s voice was strained\u2014\u201cthat he needs to confront Fergus and get it over with. Dad refused.\u201d</p><p>Kim folded chilled fingers into her palms, deciding for once to keep silent. She remembered Liam telling her that he didn\u2019t know why Dylan never fought Fergus for dominance, but that he thought it was so the Shifters could live in peace.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Liam said. \u201cDad, why?\u201d</p><p>Dylan\u2019s voice was tight, his hands clenched. His fingers had changed to claws, and blood smeared his fists. \u201cLeave it alone, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Fergus wants you to step down? To put one of his lackeys in your place? Our lives won\u2019t be worth shite if that happens. He\u2019s undercutting your position in your own pride, not to mention the clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, leave it alone!\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cDad, this is a blatant smack in the face, an invitation to challenge him.\u201d</p><p>Dylan\u2019s eyes were red with rage, but Kim saw anguish behind the animal fury. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that? But I won\u2019t. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my f**king reasons!\u201d Dylan roared.</p><p>If he\u2019d directed that anger at Kim, she knew she\u2019d run like hell. Liam stood his ground, his own hands showing claws. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re giving in for the good of Shiftertown, you\u2019re crazy. This will be his first step to drive us out of here. He\u2019ll make sure we end up in a Shiftertown far from here, where we\u2019re clanless and at the bottom of the pile. Kim will have to abandon Brian, and Brian will go down for the murder.\u201d</p><p>Kim noted Liam\u2019s big assumption\u2014that if the Morrisseys had to go, she\u2019d go with them\u2014but she decided this was not the time to bring it up.</p><p>Dylan\u2019s eyes were bleak. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s claws shredded the paper, which fell to the floor. \u201cI can\u2019t go after Fergus myself. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dylan said quietly. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why...\u201d</p><p>His words trailed off as the back door banged open and hot wind flooded past them. Glory charged in, dressed in hot pink with silver sandals, her finger-and toenails painted in matching pink. \u201cDylan, what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Dylan gave her a weary look. \u201cGlory. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus wants Grandda\u2019 to step down from leading Shiftertown,\u201d Connor babbled from the kitchen.</p><p>Glory\u2019s mouth opened in shock. \u201cWhat? We won\u2019t stand for that. The ass**le.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it,\u201d Kim agreed.</p><p>The males in the room, except Connor, ignored both women. Sean met Dylan\u2019s gaze, his face quiet. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll fight Fergus.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of shouting drowned him out. Liam huffed a bitter laugh. \u201cWhat, Sean, you\u2019ll kill me, then Dad, then go after Fergus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sean\u2019s face was white. \u201cI\u2019ll just kill the gob-shite. I can shoot him, can\u2019t I, and then stick him with the sword. Fergus is dust, no more problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then by Shifter law I\u2019ll have to take you out,\u201d Liam said in a hard voice. \u201cBad plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>The others fell silent, and Kim couldn\u2019t contain herself. \u201cAre you all crazy? Why would you let Sean even think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of this, Kim,\u201d Dylan said without looking at her.</p><p>\u201cNo, Kim has a point.\u201d Glory folded her arms, her perfect br**sts straining against her pink shirt. \u201cSean, why should you sacrifice yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo keep the peace,\u201d Sean said in a tired voice. \u201cI would be the logical choice to be the assassin and pay the price. Because I\u2019m mateless.\u201d Sean shot Liam a hard look, and Liam, surprisingly, dropped his gaze.</p><p>Glory said, \u201cListen to the human girl. If anyone should pay for this, it\u2019s Fergus himself. Let him be the sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Connor echoed.</p><p>Dylan let his voice roar through. \u201cThere will be no argument. We do what Fergus says.\u201d</p><p>Kim opened her mouth to protest, and so did Glory, but suddenly Glory shut hers, as though she understood something. Dylan was staring hard at Liam, those nonverbal cues flying between them. Dylan\u2019s eyes were feral white, Liam\u2019s not much better.</p><p>Liam dropped his gaze and turned. Dylan gave him a look of almost disappointment, then swung away and slammed himself out the back door. Glory took a deep breath, but to Kim\u2019s surprise, she didn\u2019t follow Dylan.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t understand,\u201d Kim said into the silence. \u201cWhy would your dad stand back and let Fergus win?\u201d</p><p>Liam shot her a quick look. He was worried. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Dylan isn\u2019t ready to die,\u201d Glory said. \u201cHe\u2019s not that old, and he\u2019s completely virile. Besides, he has me.\u201d</p><p>Her smug statement broke the tension a little. Connor even gave a nervous laugh. \u201cSure, that would be worth living for,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cub, youngling,\u201d Glory said. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn.\u201d</p><p>Liam remained silent, the smiling, damn-your-eyes man Kim had come to know fading into a bleak, angry Shifter. When he looked like this he was scary as hell, but Kim walked to him and ducked under his arm. The others had backed off, and for the first time since she\u2019d met this group, they were giving another Shifter space.</p><p>Kim sensed that Liam didn\u2019t need space right now; he needed touch, reassurance. She melded to his side, and Liam finally looked down at her, the feral white-blue of his eyes darkening to human blue once again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll fix this somehow,\u201d Kim dared to say. \u201cWithout anyone dying or Sean shooting Fergus in the back. Although I wouldn\u2019t mind doing that\u2014after I give him a piece of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d Liam said, lips flat. \u201cOr I\u2019ll chain you up in the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there spiders down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>Kim lifted her hand. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll try to be sensible. I see that I need to speed up my campaign to free Brian, and I have a few ideas about that.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s gaze flickered, as though suspicious about her ideas, but his fangs and claws had retreated.</p><p>Glory snorted. \u201cThe little kitten has teeth, Liam. Watch that when she goes down on you.\u201d</p><p>Connor laughed out loud. Liam gave Kim a little smile. \u201cI\u2019m willing to risk it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Glory stepped past them. \u201cExcuse me.

Time for me to go be a good little lapdog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even want to know about that,\u201d Connor said in disgust, as Glory sashayed out.</p><p>Connor came to Kim and put his arms around her in a smothering hug. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re Liam\u2019s mate, Kim, and I\u2019m glad you came home. The full-moon blessing tomorrow night is going to be some party. Me and Sean have invited everyone.\u201d</p><p>Kim remembered Liam saying something about his father pronouncing his blessing under the moon, but she hadn\u2019t paid much attention. \u201cParty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMate blessings don\u2019t happen very often, so all of Shiftertown will want to see it,\u201d Liam said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we dress casual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks.\u201d All of Shiftertown, coming to stare at her. Then again, it might be a good time to put some of her ideas in motion. If Silas was dying to learn about Shifters, she could give him a glimpse, and he could help Kim\u2019s cause at the same time. \u201cDo you mind if I invite a friend?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cFriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone I know who\u2019s helped me out in the past. Is this blessing something humans can witness?\u201d</p><p>Liam gave her a nod. \u201cSure. It won\u2019t make Fergus happy, but screw him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I keep saying.\u201d She smiled up at Liam. She knew she couldn\u2019t ease all his tension, but she could tell how far she\u2019d made him relax. \u201cI need to make a few phone calls. Mind?\u201d</p><p>Liam released her. \u201cIs this human all right about Shifters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he likes them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d</p><p>Kim laughed at Liam\u2019s sudden, possessive stare. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s just a friend. I\u2019ve known him for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s gaze softened a little, but Kim made a mental note to warn Silas not to touch her, not even casually.</p> <p>\u201cYou make your calls,\u201d Liam said, his voice gentling. He\u2019d climbed down a long way from the ready-to-kill Shifter, but he was still tense. \u201cMyself, I\u2019m going to go visit Sandra again. I\u2019d like to figure out why Fergus is pulling out all the stops to keep Brian from going to trial.\u201d</p><p>Liam found Sandra in her backyard, alone. She\u2019d wheeled her shallow charcoal-burning grill to the middle of the grass and started a fire in it. As Liam approached, he heard her chanting a prayer to the Earth goddess at the same time she tossed fragments of paper into the fire.</p><p>Liam approached silently. He meant to give her privacy to pray, but when he saw what she burned, he stepped forward and grabbed them out of her hands.</p><p>Sandra jerked around with a sharp intake of breath. Her wildcat fangs extended, her eyes going white.</p><p>Liam looked at the photos Sandra had been trying to burn. One showed Brian grinning at the camera with his arm around his mom, a bottle of beer dangling from his hand. Another showed Brian and his friends at a lake. Then Brian and a human girl, probably the murder victim, Michelle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not desperate enough for this yet,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop me. I need to make sure he gets to the Summerland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian\u2019s not going anywhere near the Summerland.\u201d Liam put his arm around Sandra\u2019s shoulder, trying to let his warmth comfort her. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve come, to ask for your help in springing him.\u201d</p> <p>Sandra looked up at him with dead eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. Now come on, let\u2019s go in and have something cold to drink. It\u2019s too bloody hot out here to be doing any straight thinking.\u201d</p><p>Sandra let Liam take her into the house, where he fetched her a cold beer. He opened a bottle himself and sank down onto her couch to drink it. He\u2019d sat here a couple days ago, he remembered, massaging Kim\u2019s feet. She had lovely feet, tiny in his big hands.</p><p>Liam tucked the photos of Brian into his pocket, knowing that if he let Sandra have them, she\u2019d go back to burning them after he\u2019d gone. An image of the loved one, sacrificed to fire, was the best way to make sure the loved one\u2019s passage into the afterlife was peaceful.</p><p>Sandra drank the beer but made no sign of enjoying it. \u201cWhat do you want, Liam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know about this human girl, Michelle. Did Brian intend to make her his mate?\u201d</p><p>Sandra regarded him in surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he would never have killed her if he did, and you know it. I hadn\u2019t thought of it before, because taking a human female for mate wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d ever considered. But Kim, she\u2019s damn smart.\u201d</p><p>Sandra eyed him sharply. \u201cI heard that you claimed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I did. Don\u2019t worry, it was sanctioned by Fergus himself. He insisted on it, actually, though I intended to make the bond anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSun and moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the sun, so far. The moon is at its fullest tomorrow night, and Dad will bless us then. Come over. It will be a grand party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kim, she\u2019s fine with you claiming her?\u201d</p><p>Liam thought of Kim\u2019s confusion, her outrage. He grinned. \u201cMaybe \u2018fine\u2019 is going a bit far, but she\u2019ll get used to it. I\u2019ll make sure of that.\u201d He took a sip of beer and saw Sandra actually smile.</p><p>He got Sandra to let him have a look in Brian\u2019s room. Brian wasn\u2019t a cub anymore\u2014he\u2019d come of age and found his place in the hierarchy, but he had continued to live here to help out his mother. The custom of human kids moving out as soon as they turned eighteen had always struck Liam as odd. Shifters lived together in family groups for generations.</p><p>Sandra had lost her mate long before she and Brian had moved to Shiftertown. Only Brian and she lived in this house, and before Brian\u2019s arrest, Sandra had been hopeful that Brian would soon claim a mate and fill the house with little ones. Now her eyes were devoid of any hope as she led Liam upstairs.</p><p>Brian occupied two rooms on the second floor\u2014he\u2019d used one as a bedroom, the other as an office. An old computer stood on his desk, jury-rigged to a couple other boxes as though he was trying to set up a network. Liam wasn\u2019t a computer whiz by any means, though he could navigate the Internet fairly well. But he didn\u2019t know enough to understand whether Brian was trying to make his computer do something illegal or simply work better.</p><p>Sandra turned away after she let Liam in, as though she couldn\u2019t bear to enter Brian\u2019s rooms. That was fine with Liam. He went through Brian\u2019s desk thoroughly while he waited for the computer to boot up, but he didn\u2019t find anything useful. Old receipts for gas, cardboard coasters, souvenirs from various attractions around Austin, and old raffle-type tickets.</p><p>The computer, it turned out, didn\u2019t have the helpful screen full of icons to click on. A list of files scrolled by when Liam hit the Enter key, and then the cursor sat at the bottom of the screen, blinking at him.</p><p>\u201cShite.\u201d He\u2019d have to have Sean take a look. Sean knew far more about computers than Liam did, more than Shifters were allowed to know.</p><p>The rest of Brian\u2019s living room\u2014his video and DVD collection, his books, his magazines\u2014told Liam nothing except that, like Connor, Brian had an obsession with cars. Cars were a sickness among younger Shifters. Liam couldn\u2019t see the attraction; it wasn\u2019t as though they were Harleys.</p><p>Liam took a quick look through Brian\u2019s bedroom, but came up with even less. If Brian had secrets, he didn\u2019t hide them in the house he shared with his mother. Liam did find a few pictures of Michelle tossed carelessly into the drawer of the nightstand. She\u2019d been a pretty girl, with honey-blonde hair and a sweet smile, her skin tanned from the Texas sun. Photos of her and Brian together told Liam she didn\u2019t mind at all that he was Shifter.</p><p>\u201cDid you put these in here?\u201d he called to Sandra.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said when she looked. \u201cBrian kept them there. The police took away about half of them when they searched.\u201d</p><p>Liam was surprised they\u2019d left any. But maybe they\u2019d taken enough to show the jury what a pretty, helpless innocent Brian had corrupted.</p><p>\u201cCan I have this one?\u201d He held up a photo of Michelle with both arms around Brian.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to make herself stop caring. Liam recognized the signs, having seen them in both his father and Kenny when they lost their mates. Pretending that they\u2019d let go, that their beloved\u2019s things were just things, of no importance.</p><p>\u201cWill you ask Brian about her?\u201d Liam asked as he pocketed the photos. \u201cFind out whether he was going to claim her? It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Sandra shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll not be visiting him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up yet.\u201d</p><p>Vehemence entered her eyes, making her come alive. \u201cI can\u2019t visit him. He won\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Liam\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cFergus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Fergus. I\u2019ve been told to stay away, to let Brian go.\u201d</p><p>Liam went to her and rubbed her shoulders. \u201cSandra, you can\u2019t do that. He\u2019s your son, your cub. He needs you now more than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to Fergus. I had orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s me overriding those orders.\u201d</p><p>Sandra laughed, an unhealthy sound. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m using my prerogative of second in command of this Shiftertown.\u201d For now, he thought silently. \u201cI say go see Brian, and let me deal with Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that. He can kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already wants to kill me for so very many reasons. You\u2019re the only one who can do this for us, love. Fergus won\u2019t let me near Brian, and he won\u2019t let Kim talk to him anymore, but stopping a mother from seeing her cub\u2014that one he won\u2019t be able to justify. I\u2019m betting he knows that.\u201d</p><p>Sandra looked tired. \u201cI can\u2019t stand up to him, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to. He\u2019s not here, and his lieutenants won\u2019t interfere with a mother\u2019s rights.\u201d Liam gave her an encouraging smile. \u201cEven Fergus\u2019s thugs have mothers who wouldn\u2019t let them hear the end of it if they kept you from your cub.\u201d</p><p>Sandra relaxed a little. \u201cYou are full of shit, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it. They won\u2019t hurt you, not around so many humans. You want to see Brian, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Liam rubbed her shoulders again, wishing he could tell her that everything would be fine and mean it. \u201cThey\u2019ll waffle about stopping you, but they won\u2019t let me anywhere near the jail. But you go on. Have a good talk with him, and tell me everything he says.\u201d</p><p>Kim hung up her cell phone as Liam walked in the back door. A strange sensation flashed through her, and it took her a minute to recognize it\u2014she was glad to see him.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been so happy to see someone enter a room in a long, long time, not since her parents had passed. Friends were fine, and Abel was\u2014All right, so whenever Abel had walked in, her first reaction usually had been impatience and irritation.</p><p>Seeing Liam made her heart beat faster and not simply because of lust. She went warm as he smiled at her and leaned down to kiss her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour dad, still next door with Glory. Connor went out to hook up with some friends, he said. Ellison came over, and he and Sean took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did he? Leaving you alone and unprotected?\u201d He played with the hair at the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cNot with every single one of your neighbors outside staring at the house. Maybe you noticed them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWondering what I\u2019m doing in here with the human woman.\u201d Liam massaged her neck, leaning down to nip the shell of her ear. \u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kim\u2019s body grew pliant. \u201cLiam, about this friend I want to invite...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him? He wasn\u2019t your lover, was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Really, he\u2019s just a friend. I\u2019ve known him since college. I didn\u2019t want to say this in front of all the others, but Silas is a journalist. A very good one. He wants to do some pieces on Shifters and make a documentary. Kind of show how they\u2019re mistreated, that kind of angle.\u201d</p><p>Liam straightened up, eyes wary. \u201cLet another human uncover Shifter secrets?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I mean show Shifter life in its reality\u2014the kids playing in the yards, like that Michael in his pool I saw the first day I was here. He\u2019s cute, and he\u2019d have great appeal. Humans can watch Shifter moms planting gardens, dads coming home from their working-class jobs. Teenagers like Connor playing soccer or holding hands with their girlfriends. Let people see how peaceful you are, how normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all? You know Fergus would never let that happen,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you.\u201d Kim smiled up at him, trying to look impossibly sweet.</p><p>Liam\u2019s gaze softened. \u201cYou\u2019re a crafty lass, Kim. You want these stories to switch public opinion to Brian\u2019s side, don\u2019t you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Liam laughed softly and kissed the top of her head. \u201cAnd you know if I say yes, I won\u2019t tell Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. Or your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr my father, who would feel obligated to pass on the information. Bring this Silas to the party and let me meet him. No cameras, no notebooks. Strictly off the record until I get to know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. He\u2019s fair, Liam, which is why I thought of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I don\u2019t like him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell him no. Promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d Liam leaned down, resumed nibbling her earlobe. \u201cBut enough talking. I\u2019m thinking about the fact that we\u2019re alone in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving someone in the house didn\u2019t stop you yesterday,\u201d she pointed out in a shaky voice.</p><p>\u201cThat was mating frenzy. Today I want to take it slow. To give you everything I want, in my own time.\u201d Liam ran his fingers down her spine, trailing fire. \u201cI want to see if you\u2019re wearing garters under that sexy skirt.\u201d</p><p>Kim leaned against the kitchen counter and slid her skirt up a few inches. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s warm hands covered her thighs, his thumbs hooking into the tops of her stockings. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Kim found herself seated on the counter with Liam standing between her legs. Liam\u2019s warm lips played on hers while he slid his hands to the insides of her thighs. \u201cCould this be a thong?\u201d he murmured, touching it. \u201cThe thing you said you couldn\u2019t be wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you wear it for me, Kim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Liam nuzzled her cheek. \u201cI like that.\u201d He licked where he nuzzled. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to move aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Kim drew her hand along his zipper. \u201cYou\u2019re ready too, I see. Either that or you shoved a baseball bat down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking that would be painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking you\u2019re in pain now,\u201d Kim whispered in his ear. \u201cI would be, if I had something that big in my pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to find out what it\u2019s like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never done it leaning back on a counter, her skirt up, her panties shoved aside, and her lover letting his jeans drop around his ankles. But then, she\u2019d never had a lover like Liam, a large, raw-muscled Irishman with beautiful eyes.</p><p>She found herself with her legs locked around him, his hands cradling her head while she felt the burn of them joining. His lips were all over her, face, throat, hair, mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, Kim. You feel so f**king good.\u201d</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t answer. She sensed desperation in him, the need to bury himself in sex and forget the strange argument he\u2019d had with his dad as well as Fergus\u2019s ultimatum. Liam seemed the most unnerved of all of them, even Dylan.</p><p>The untamed joy of what they did made Kim want to shout out loud, and so did the danger that someone could walk in and catch them. Her partners had always practiced safe sex\u2014not only in the sense of using condoms, but in ensuring the lights were out, the doors locked, and the windows shaded, so no one would ever know what they were doing.</p><p>Liam wanted Kim and didn\u2019t care who knew. He\u2019d broadcast the fact far and wide, proudly. Instead of being embarrassed, Kim\u2019s heart swelled with joy.</p><p>Another part of her did too. She rocked her hips, loving the sensation of him deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d she groaned. \u201cI want you to do dirty things to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to, love,\u201d he said, his face against hers. \u201cYou name them, I\u2019ll do them.\u201d</p><p>She moved faster, and he did, and she did again. \u201cI\u2019m loving this right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love what you make me feel,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kim tried to think of something sexy to say, but words fled her brain. \u201cJust shut up and do me.\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed. He rocked into her swiftly, until they were both breathless with it. Liam held her tightly as he came, his seed scalding, his mouth hard on hers. His kisses were still unpracticed, but Kim didn\u2019t care. She caught his tongue, his lips, his teeth with hers, kissing him back with joyous abandon.</p><p>Liam smiled into her mouth, and Kim laughed with him. Sex didn\u2019t get better than this.</p><p>Her heart beat wildly when she thought that maybe it did\u2014with Liam. The idea triggered her orgasm. She gyrated against him, unsure how much noise she was making and not really caring.</p><p>When she wound down, Liam backed out of her, still hard, pulled up his pants, and carried her to the sagging living room sofa. He collapsed onto it, Kim on top of him, both of them panting.</p><p>\u201cOh, man, that was good.\u201d Kim lay against his shoulder trying to get her breath. Laughter didn\u2019t help.</p><p>Liam ran his fingers through her hair. \u201cNot what I had in mind, but not bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not bad?\u201d</p><p>Liam regarded her with half-closed predator\u2019s eyes. \u201cI told you, I wanted to take it slow. Love you like you deserve. Not screwing you quick-time on a kitchen counter.\u201d</p><p>Kim kissed the tip of his nose. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind. Not at all. Maybe you noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to give you so much.\u201d Liam\u2019s hold tightened into a hard embrace. \u201cSo much, Kim. Everything I once had, everything I lost. I want it back\u2014for you.\u201d</p><p>She heard Liam\u2019s heart beating rapidly beneath her ear, and her own heart squeezed. His declarations scared her. She could dismiss his words as those of a man happy he\u2019d just gotten into a woman\u2019s pants, words that would evaporate as soon as he was sated. Except the throbbing of his heart was from more than physical exertion. His voice held uncertainty, a longing he feared he couldn\u2019t fulfill.</p><p>Kim ran her fingers along the hard plane of his chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anything for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be daft, woman. I take care of you now. I want to do everything for you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI take care of myself. I have a decent job and a nice house. That\u2019s more than a lot of people have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore we took the Collar, a man took his mate home to his family and sequestered her. He did everything for her, hunted for her, kept her warm and fed and comfortable, pampered her in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I guess you hadn\u2019t ever heard of women\u2019s rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the nineteenth century, love.\u201d Liam smiled. \u201cNot sequestered as in kept in prison. Sequestered as in protected from all others. Female Shifters have always been in short supply, and we had to keep them from being stolen by other Shifters. The mate bond is sacrosanct, but when times were bad, other males stopped caring about sacrosanct.\u201d He cradled Kim closer. \u201cSo I have to fight my instincts not to lock you somewhere safe and beat off everyone from even looking at you.\u201d</p><p>Kim had never considered herself a precious object before. Certainly Abel had never treated her as more than a convenience, and men she\u2019d dated earlier in life hadn\u2019t been much better. Her relationships had been the \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d kind. No true, undying love, no I want to take care of you and protect you for the rest of our lives.</p><p>Kim had spent enough time taking care of herself that having someone want to relieve her of the burden felt strange, though nice. She wasn\u2019t going to let Liam do it, but the feeling was still nice.</p><p>Liam swung her into his arms and rolled to his feet at the same time. Kim found herself against his chest with her head on his shoulder, Liam striding toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTaking you upstairs where we belong. I\u2019m tired of fighting my instincts.\u201d</p><p>A pleasant shiver went through her. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were white-blue when he looked down at her, his pupils changing. \u201cI\u2019m going to love you all night, my mate. On a bed. I\u2019m going to love you until we can\u2019t stand up.\u201d</p><p>If Abel had said that, Kim would have rolled her eyes or thought about what unsatisfying work that would be. When Liam said it, her whole body came alive.</p><p>To tease him, she said, \u201cI really should look at my case files.\u201d</p><p>The look Liam gave her was savage. \u201cScrew your case files.\u201d</p><p>Kim laughed. Liam growled and sprinted up the last of the stairs, slammed into the bedroom and tossed her on the bed. As her clothes came off, then his, Kim gave in. For one night of her life, she was going to enjoy making wild, crazy love with a man who promised to make it unforgettable, no matter what might come in the morning.</p><p>It was Sean\u2019s turn to cook breakfast, and Liam grabbed a plateful of pancakes from him as the sun poured through the eastern windows. \u201cKim will be down in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Sean sent him an annoyed look with bloodshot eyes. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of soundproofing your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sounds of loving bother you that much, do they?\u201d Liam asked him.</p><p>\u201cIt does when you\u2019re shouting all night.\u201d</p><p>Connor grinned from his place at the table. \u201cI had to wear headphones with the music cranked up. It barely drowned you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gobshites are just jealous. Where\u2019s Dad?\u201d</p><p>Sean slammed the spatula to the counter. \u201cWhere do you think?\u201d</p><p>Next door. With Glory. Good. \u201cDo you begrudge your old dad getting some?\u201d Liam asked Sean in a light voice. \u201cA grateful son you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean\u2019s pissed because he\u2019s not getting any,\u201d Connor said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind because I\u2019m still too young and innocent to know what it all means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Sean growled.</p><p>Connor laughed at him. Liam clapped Sean on the shoulder and turned away with his breakfast. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a mate someday, Sean. Then we\u2019ll make fun of the noise from your room.\u201d</p><p>Sean gave him a dark look and went back to his batter. His bad mood was about more than Liam keeping him awake. Sean had been ready to lay down his life for them yesterday, and that hadn\u2019t been an easy thing for him to do.</p><p>Liam started to sit down, then felt the unmistakable presence of Kim coming down the stairs. Smelled her as well, all fresh from her shower. She wore a casual skirt and sleeveless shirt, her legs bare, feet in strappy, high-heeled sandals.</p><p>\u201cAre those pancakes?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Liam drew her into his arms. He\u2019d woken with her in his arms not an hour ago, and hadn\u2019t that been the best feeling in the world? Liam nuzzled her cheek, then kissed her lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kim smiled up at him. \u201cPancakes are that good, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean\u2019s almost as good a cook as me. Come and sit.\u201d</p><p>Connor got out of his chair as Kim approached, and Liam gave him a nod. Kim looked startled as Connor wrapped his lanky arms around her, ending his sloppy hug with a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Kim,\u201d he said as he released her.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning to you too. I\u2014\u201d Her speech cut off as Sean stepped up and gave her a more practiced hug, tight squeeze, a rub on the back, a kiss to her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou like blueberry, Kim?\u201d Sean asked, as he released her and turned back to the stove.</p><p>\u201cSure. Blueberry. Great.\u201d</p><p>Liam caressed the back of Kim\u2019s neck and led her to her place at the table. \u201cSleep well, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kim plopped down, reached for the pitcher of juice in the middle of the table. \u201cBut you know that. Sean, Connor, are you trying to comfort me for having to spend the night with Liam?\u201d</p> <p>Connor hooted with laughter. Even Sean broke out of his sour mood to grin. \u201cAre you in need of comfort, Kim?\u201d Sean asked. \u201cIs he that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it,\u201d Liam growled, but he was too full of afterglow to care about their teasing. \u201cThey\u2019re acknowledging you as my mate, love. Welcoming you to the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot. Shifters like to hug. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Liam ran his hand up Kim\u2019s arm, her silken skin a joy beneath his fingertips. \u201cIs there something wrong with that? Touching and hugging is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unusual,\u201d Kim said. \u201cFor humans, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching is reassurance, keeping the bonds between family intact. It\u2019s more than love; it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHumans do it too,\u201d Sean said from the stove. \u201cExcept they get embarrassed. So they invent strange rituals, like giving flowers and candy to ladies. Human men punch each other when they like each other. I\u2019ve seen them do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean has made a study of humans and their behavior,\u201d Liam said. \u201cIt gives him something to do.\u201d</p><p>Kim gave Sean a look of respect. \u201cWell, if you can figure out human behavior, more power to you. Even humans can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m outside looking in,\u201d Sean said. \u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are Shifters to humans.\u201d Kim accepted her plate of pancakes and dug in. \u201cI know you all don\u2019t want to talk about this, but I don\u2019t want to hear any more discussion about you giving in to Fergus. He\u2019s just trying to sow dissention. I\u2019ve been thinking it over, and I think what y\u2019all really need is a good lawyer, and one just happens to be eating pancakes with you. I\u2019m going to dig into Shifter law and see if Fergus really can tell your dad to step down, or try to find some loophole to keep him from succeeding. So I\u2019ll need to know what rules and customs or whatever aren\u2019t written down. I need to know everything.\u201d</p><p>With his mate so near, with her scent and his all over her, Liam didn\u2019t much care about Fergus, Brian, and the screwed-up mess they\u2019d gotten the rest of Shiftertown into. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, Kim. I won\u2019t stop you trying. Just don\u2019t be getting your hopes up, love.\u201d</p><p>Kim finished the last of her pancakes and got to her feet. \u201cIt beats letting Fergus win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Liam said, watching her hips sway as she took her plate to the sink. \u201cI won\u2019t let him.\u201d</p> <p>Sean gave him a dark look. \u201cI still think my way is best.\u201d He didn\u2019t mean it like he had yesterday, Liam could tell, because Sean\u2019s tension had eased a long way. But Sean was still angry.</p><p>\u201cWe need you as the Guardian, Sean,\u201d Liam said softly. \u201cConnor\u2019s not yet ready to take up the sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-ho,\u201d Connor said, from deep in his car magazine. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare die on me, Sean.\u201d</p><p>Kim looked confused again. Liam gestured her out to the back porch and followed her down the steps to the fenceless backyard and the Austin summer sunshine. It would be another hot one, but later tonight, the cool moon would cover the yard in silver light.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to work,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll try to come with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be coming with you. I\u2019m not letting you out of my sight, not with Fergus\u2019s thugs wandering about and Fergus mad as hell at the Morrisseys. He\u2019s not above making an example of disobedient clan members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fix this, Liam.\u201d</p><p>Liam just gave her a nod. \u201cEven so\u2014not out of my sight, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with Sean?\u201d she asked, glancing back at the house.</p><p>It took Kim a while to voice questions, Liam noticed. Must be the lawyer in her, thinking carefully before she pried out the information she wanted.</p><p>Liam rubbed his hair, not liking to think about it. \u201cSean has always blamed himself for Kenny\u2019s death. I blame myself, because I was stupidly obeying orders when I should have been protecting them both. But Sean was right there beside Kenny. Sean fought and survived, but he couldn\u2019t save Kenny. It eats at him, it does.\u201d</p><p>Kim gave him a skeptical look. \u201cOh, please. I know damn well Sean didn\u2019t simply stand aside and watch Kenny get killed. He must have fought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs the Guardian, his first duty is to the sword, and he couldn\u2019t risk letting the feral get it. Kenny knew that. He was fighting to protect the Guardian and the sword.\u201d</p><p>Kim gave him a wide-eyed stare. \u201cYou mean that piece of metal was more important than your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. But the Guardian has a huge responsibility to the whole clan. He has to survive to keep the sword free in case he needs to use it on one of us. Kenny knew what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>He could tell Kim didn\u2019t really understand, but her look softened. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it any easier, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Kim slid her arms around his waist. \u201cLiam, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He felt her sorrow. Liam melted into her, tears tracking down his face for the brother he\u2019d lost. Being a Shifter was all about sacrifice, and the fact that Kim understood that untwisted something inside him that had been knotted for a decade.</p><p>Kim worked through the day in her office, catching up on phone calls and paperwork, preparing for the court case she was determined to have for Brian. The private investigator she\u2019d hired told Kim he\u2019d discovered evidence that Michelle\u2019s ex-boyfriend had burned with plenty of resentment when Michelle had started seeing Brian. Threats had been made, and friends of the ex-boyfriend had been worried. Good. Kim told him to keep searching that angle.</p><p>Kim also pulled up every single piece of information she had on Shifter law and went over it again. She\u2019d find something to stop Fergus trying to defeat the Morrisseys, no matter how long it took. The human government didn\u2019t usually interfere with Shifter hierarchy, mostly because they didn\u2019t understand it. But Kim would find some way to solve this, and Liam would figure out why Fergus wanted Brian executed.</p><p>Working with Liam stretched out on her office couch unnerved Kim, especially when he spent the whole time watching her. He didn\u2019t demand her attention or interrupt; he just...watched.</p><p>He reminded Kim of lions on the African veldt, sitting under the shade of whatever those trees were, watching herds of gazelles. Maybe the lions wouldn\u2019t be hungry right then, but they\u2019d watch. Heads up, ears pricked, alert. Still. Waiting.</p><p>By five-thirty, the gazelle in her was ready to go home.</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t bother trying to go to her own house. She drove with Liam straight back to Shiftertown, feeling a strange kind of relief to do so.</p><p>When Kim and Liam arrived at the Morrissey house, Sean had a big charcoal-burning barbeque going in the backyard, and beer and ice overflowed from several coolers. A dozen Shifters lounged on the porch and through the yard, talking to Sean and Dylan. Connor kicked a soccer ball around with a few other young men his age, while two teenaged females stood back and assessed them.</p><p>Kim\u2019s journalist friend Silas pulled up shortly after. He was tall and very thin, with a prominent Adam\u2019s apple.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this party for?\u201d Silas asked when Kim presented him to Liam. Kim had warned Silas that only Liam knew what he was really doing there, and he promised to be discreet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing under the moon, that it is,\u201d Liam answered him. He flashed his teeth in a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s after being a very interestin\u2019 ritual.\u201d</p><p>Kim rolled her eyes at the exaggerated Irish-isms, but at least he\u2019d quit saying, \u201cTop o\u2019 the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a cartoon leprechaun,\u201d she said to him, after they\u2019d introduced Silas around and left him talking animatedly to Annie from the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhist, it\u2019s my feelings you\u2019ll be hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it, Liam.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up, and he laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re learning, darling.\u201d His laughter was warm, reminding her of him loving her all night, and even now he gave her a look of undisguised hunger. \u201cI haven\u2019t touched you in too long.\u201d</p><p>Pleasant shivers ran through her. She agreed. It had been too long since any intimate touching. Hours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already wishing the ritual over and everyone gone home,\u201d Liam said in her ear.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably eat first. Be social.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Liam slid his hands to her backside and scooped her against him for a kiss. \u201cBut I hope this doesn\u2019t take all night.\u201d</p><p>They strolled back to the barbeque as more Shifters joined the throng. Everyone Kim had met in Shiftertown was there\u2014the wolf Ellison, Glory, Annie, Sandra, the women on the porches she\u2019d passed the first day, little Michael who\u2019d been proud of his plastic pool.</p><p>Kim stiffened when she saw Fergus\u2019s two thugs\u2014the shaved-headed, tattooed guy and military guy with sunglasses. But Sean handed them plates of charred burger with buns, unsurprised.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to fight anyone, are they?\u201d Kim asked as she took her burger from Sean. The two men had moved off to eat, and she noted the other Shifters gave them a wide berth. \u201cOr bring out a cat-o\u2019-nine-tails and start whaling on people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here to observe the ritual,\u201d Sean told her. \u201cStand-ins for Fergus. And they\u2019ll be on their best behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have put Silas off if I\u2019d known they\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head. \u201cThey won\u2019t disrupt the ritual. Fergus wants this mating done, and he wants to make sure Dad relinquishes power tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Kim nodded glumly. She hadn\u2019t yet found a law that Fergus was bending by asking Dylan to vacate his post, but she would. She\u2019d leave no stone unturned.</p><p>She chewed the burger Sean handed her, which was very good, especially with the gooey cheese melted on it. Her diet had gone to hell, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to care.</p><p>Ellison came out of the crowd in his big black Stetson and cowboy boots. He high-fived Liam, and then the two men shared a tight bear hug.</p><p>\u201cKim!\u201d Ellison boomed, his arms opened wide, and before Kim could duck away, Ellison swept off his hat and spun her off her feet. Liam rescued Kim\u2019s plate of half-eaten burger as Ellison swung Kim around. \u201cCongratulations, woman.\u201d Ellison set Kim down and gave her abdomen a gentle pat. \u201cWhen\u2019s it due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Ellison looked shocked. \u201cLiam, haven\u2019t you touched her yet? What\u2019s the matter with you? You\u2019re already sun-blessed. Are you waiting for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done it, trust me.\u201d Liam handed Kim back her meal. \u201cIt will be soon.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s face went hot. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot my business? Hon, it\u2019s every Shifter\u2019s business whether a Shifter male can do the job. We have to be good at making babies, so we practice a lot.\u201d He balled his fists and thrust his hips in a parody of sex.</p><p>\u201cIgnore him, Kim. Lupines are disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Glory said. She stepped past Ellison, tall and sleek in skin-tight black pants and silk top, every blonde hair in place. \u201cFucking Felines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGobshite Lupines,\u201d Liam said cheerfully.</p> <p>Dylan approached. \u201cKim.\u201d</p><p>Kim watched him in trepidation, but Dylan folded his arms around her and squeezed her in a very tight hug. She sensed something different in his hug than she had in the others\u2019. Not happy exuberance\u2014relief. Dylan held her close, and she smelled the damp cotton of his shirt and his shaving soap. But Dylan\u2019s hold wasn\u2019t in any way sexual. He held her as he\u2019d cradle a child, as he might soothe Connor.</p><p>Dylan held Kim a long time, and his eyes were wet when he pulled away. He wiped them, unashamed, then turned and wrapped his arms around Liam.</p><p>Father and son stood still in the embrace, while Kim took her burger back from Ellison. To stem the tears that insisted on filling her eyes, she reflected that she needed to eat fast, before more people wanted to greet her with hugs.</p><p>Kim noticed that Glory didn\u2019t try to hug her\u2014the woman sauntered away to get food with Dylan when Dylan finally released Liam. Kim wondered whether Glory was showing her disapproval for Liam taking a human mate, or whether the woman didn\u2019t feel like she was close enough to the family to join the hug-fest. Glory and Dylan might be hard at it, but sex did not necessarily mean intimacy, Kim knew from experience. The woman was a puzzle.</p> <p>It took a while for the summer night to darken, but Liam and Dylan seemed in no hurry. Liam introduced Kim to all present, holding her hand or with his arm around her waist as they strolled from group to group. Kim met Lupines and other Felines, and bears.</p><p>The bear Shifters fascinated her, large-boned men and women who sported long manes of hair. Many of the bear-men were bearded, and both men and women obviously liked tattoos. They, too, welcomed Kim with hugs, though they were less intimate than the family\u2019s hugs. Not all of them looked happy that Liam was bringing a human into their midst, but they were cordial.</p><p>By the time Liam walked Kim back to the center of the yard, the night was dark and mercifully cooler. The moon rose rapidly, and as it reached its zenith, the crowd grew quiet.</p><p>Liam\u2019s neighbors silently formed two concentric circles, putting Liam, Kim, and Dylan in the middle of the inner one. The smaller, inner circle contained Liam\u2019s immediate family and friends, along with Fergus\u2019s two henchmen. The outer circle held the rest of Shiftertown.</p><p>Cool moonlight filtered through the trees, touching Kim\u2019s face as Liam turned her toward him. As he had when they\u2019d stood before Fergus in the San Antonio Shiftertown, Liam held his left hand up, palm out, and pressed it to Kim\u2019s right one. He twined his fingers through hers and met her gaze with steady eyes.</p><p>Dylan closed both his hands around theirs and began chanting something in a language Kim didn\u2019t recognize. Irish\u2014Gaelic? Or some kind of Shifter language? The circles of Shifters answered, chanting in slow rhythm. The Shifters began circling around them, the first circle moving clockwise, the second one counterclockwise. They stepped in deliberate, slow movements, an ancient-looking dance that was simple and powerful.</p> <p>Dylan finally stopped chanting. \u201cBy the light of the moon,\u201d he said in a loud, grave voice, \u201cI recognize this mating.\u201d</p><p>Ellison howled. Soon all the wolves joined in, followed by wildcat roars and the loud growling of the bears. Liam drew Kim against him and buried her in a kiss.</p><p>\u201cThank you, love,\u201d he grated. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>In the San Antonio Shiftertown, the Shifters had gone nuts with beer and an impromptu party, but that had been nothing compared to the revelry that exploded here. Shifters grabbed one another, hugging, laughing, dancing around like maniacs. Beer flowed, kids ran around shrieking, couples kissed. More than one shed clothes and Shifted, and soon the yard was filled with wildcats, wolves, and bears.</p><p>Kim looked around for Silas, wondering what he\u2019d make of all this. The tall man stood with Annie, a bottle of beer in his hand. Annie and he were the same height, and Annie had draped her arm around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cGreat party, Kim.\u201d Silas grinned. He looked happy, not angry or scared. Good.</p><p>Glory approached, looking a little more relaxed. \u201cAnnie,\u201d she said. \u201cCaught a human? Liam\u2019s starting a trend.\u201d</p><p>Annie pressed herself closer to Silas. \u201cHe\u2019s all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI invited him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Glory stepped away from Dylan and actually enfolded Kim in a well-perfumed hug. \u201cThey need you, honey. Be good to them.\u201d</p><p>Connor came hurtling toward her, followed closely by Sean, and Kim backed up against Liam. \u201cMore hugging? I\u2019m going to be bruised all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re happy,\u201d Liam said in her ear. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a joining in a long time. In our family, we thought we\u2019d not have another for many years. If ever.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s reply was cut off by first Connor, then Sean embracing her, then Connor again. \u201cI have an aunt,\u201d Connor shouted. \u201cI have an aunt, and I\u2019ll have a cousin soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you want to tell me, Kim?\u201d Silas said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cGo along with it,\u201d Kim told him. \u201cThey like babies. They like even the possibility of babies, no matter how remote. They\u2019ve had a hard time with infant mortality.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d piqued his interest. Again, good. Liam talked conversationally to Silas about the low ratio of females to males and the fact that it used to be sadly common for Shifter women to die in childbirth. \u201cBut it\u2019s getting better,\u201d Liam finished. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing taking the Collar gave us, a bit of peace in which to take care of our families.\u201d</p><p>Silas looked curiously at Liam\u2019s Collar. \u201cWhat are those made of? I heard that they have magic in them, but that\u2019s just a story, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes were clear and innocent. \u201cDon\u2019t you believe in magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters aren\u2019t magic,\u201d Silas said, smiling to acknowledge Liam\u2019s teasing. \u201cYou have some genetic quirk that allows you to shift to animal form, right? An ancient ancestor that we knew nothing about until Shifters were discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s genetics partly, yes,\u201d Liam answered. \u201cWe were bred long ago to be playthings and hunters. Until our breeders discovered that hunters bite.\u201d He smiled, showing all his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou were bred deliberately?\u201d Silas asked. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. And our creators used magic to do it. What other explanation is there for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenetic manipulation?\u201d Silas shrugged. \u201cCould ancient cultures do that?\u201d</p><p>Kim wondered how much Liam would explain, but Liam kept talking. \u201cThe Fae could. That\u2019s the Fair Folk of Celtic and Gaelic legend, I\u2019m meaning. Their magic made us, but our strength kept us alive when the Fae started disappearing from the world. Shifters were good at survival; Fae were good at running away. So which of us was stronger?\u201d</p><p>The Shifters around them smiled and nodded.</p><p>Silas looked interested. \u201cSo the story that magic is in your Collars...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs true,\u201d Liam answered. \u201cNot that humans believe it, but it doesn\u2019t matter, does it? All they know is that the Collars keep us tame. That\u2019s why you can stand so close to Annie without her eating you. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night\u2019s young,\u201d Annie purred.</p><p>Silas grinned. \u201cAre you trying to terrify the human and make him run away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, would we do that?\u201d Annie asked him.</p><p>Liam\u2019s teeth were getting a little pointed. \u201cHow about a demonstration of what the Collars do? Would that put you at your ease?\u201d</p><p>The Shifters looked uncomfortable. Kim knew Liam brought this up for Silas\u2019s benefit, the perfect opportunity to prove that the Collars worked, to show that Brian couldn\u2019t possibly have murdered a human. But the Shifters, including Dylan, started frowning.</p><p>\u201cI read that the Collars send deep pain along the nervous system,\u201d Silas said, not noticing. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask you to show me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut humans want to know everything about Shifters, don\u2019t they?\u201d Liam continued, his voice silky. \u201cThe good, the bad, the underbelly.\u201d</p><p>A wolf loped up to them and threw himself on his back at Kim\u2019s feet, squirming happily.</p><p>\u201cUnderbelly,\u201d she repeated nervously. \u201cHa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Ellison,\u201d Liam said. \u201cGet on with you, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Ellison?\u201d Silas asked in surprise.</p><p>The wolf rolled to his feet, gave them a roguish look, and loped off again.</p><p>\u201cIn his glory.\u201d Liam turned back to Silas. \u201cYou\u2019re right, lad. The Collars are bloody painful. That\u2019s why none of us are violent, including the notorious Brian sitting in his jail cell. And no, none of us want to show you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself, Liam.\u201d Glory put her hands on her hips, her skin-tight outfit stretching in interesting ways. \u201cThe human isn\u2019t going to believe the Collars work until he sees it for himself. You want a demo, I\u2019ll give you one.\u201d</p><p>She fixed her gaze on Silas, her eyes going Shifter white. Her face didn\u2019t change, but the wild wolf she was shone out through the sex kitten she pretended to be. Annie and Liam moved to protect Silas, and as they did, Glory spun, caught Kim in a headlock, and started to strangle her.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>So this was what it was like to die. No thought of martial arts, just Kim clawing at Glory\u2019s hands. She flashed back to the feral Shifter trying to kill her in her bedroom, her fear spiking.</p><p>Kim had no breath. Her vision went dark, her lungs burned, and her heart pumped frantically, desperate for oxygen. Dimly, she heard Liam roar.</p><p>Sparks flew out into the night, Glory\u2019s Collar going off. Air poured back into Kim\u2019s lungs, and she sat down hard as Glory flung her aside to face the wildcat leaping at them.</p><p>Liam.</p><p>Glory half changed, trying to meet the attack, but her Collar kept sparking, her body jerking with pain.</p><p>Dylan knocked into Liam\u2019s side, shifting as he went. Liam\u2019s clothes ripped as the wildcat burst out of them. Then the two were rolling over each other with savage intensity, snarling, raking claws, biting. Their Collars triggered, muscles and fur shuddering with the shocks, but they didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cMate,\u201d Glory rasped. Her hands were at her neck, the Collar stark black against her white throat. \u201cStupid. I attacked his mate. He couldn\u2019t help it. He had to defend...\u201d</p><p>The rest of the Shifters moved back to give the fighting wildcats room. Sean watched, white-faced, looking poised to run back into the house.</p><p>\u201cStop them,\u201d Kim shouted at him.</p><p>He answered, tight-lipped. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m the Guardian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo guard something!\u201d</p><p>Connor shrieked. Shifters jumped, turned his way. Connor balled his fists. \u201cNo,\u201d he yelled. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Sean grabbed for him, but Connor shook him off and leapt for the two snarling wildcats. He\u2019d half changed to a gangly young wildcat when his Collar went off in midleap. His scream echoed through the clearing.</p><p>\u201cConnor,\u201d Kim shouted.</p><p>Glory dragged herself up and ran to him. Still Sean hung back, watching, waiting.</p><p>Connor\u2019s Collar kept sparking, and he keened as he had when Fergus had done the Summoning. He shifted back to human, his clothes in shreds.</p><p>Glory pulled him into her arms. \u201cKim, help me,\u201d she called. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One of the wildcats rolled away from the other and landed against a tree. Its limbs distorted, and Liam emerged, naked, dirt and long, bloody scratches streaking his body. The other cat became Dylan, lying flat on his back in the mud, panting.</p><p>\u201cKim!\u201d Glory yelled.</p><p>Glory was rocking Connor on her lap. Kim went to them and dropped to her knees behind Connor, feeling ineffectual.</p><p>\u201cHe needs your touch,\u201d Glory said. \u201cYou\u2019re family now.\u201d</p> <p>Kim put her hands on Connor\u2019s bare back. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Con.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs more than that. Goddess, how do you humans survive?\u201d</p><p>Because being human is all about personal space? Shifters\u2019 personal space was different. Kim had thought she understood\u2014Shifters liked to touch, the same way cats rubbed against other cats they knew and liked.</p><p>But she realized now that there was more to it. The Shifters\u2019 need to touch wasn\u2019t simply for affection; it was comfort and reassurance. And maybe release from pain? Kim remembered how Sean and Liam had held Sandra between them to calm her the first day Kim had come to Shiftertown. Kim had thought that the three were being sexual, but she knew now that there hadn\u2019t been anything sexual about their group huddle.</p><p>Kim slid her arms around Connor and leaned onto his back. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, sweetie,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve stopped.\u201d</p> <p>Glory had Connor\u2019s head on her shoulder, her arm around him. Connor had stopped his horrible keening, but he shivered violently.</p><p>He really was young, Kim had realized when he\u2019d shifted. As a wildcat, Connor was underdeveloped, little more than a cub, never mind he was twenty in human years and attending college. The gulf between his world and Kim\u2019s gaped wide.</p><p>Gulf. Oh, hell, Silas.</p><p>Kim looked up. Silas remained with Annie, who\u2019d taken a protective stance in front of him. Silas\u2019s eyes were wide, but the man had seen the worst areas of Iraq and Afghanistan. Two Shifter-cats battling it out shouldn\u2019t faze him. She hoped.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t your Collars work?\u201d he asked into the silence.</p><p>Dylan still lay on his back with his eyes closed, his face ashen. Liam answered, \u201cThey did. This is pain you\u2019re looking at, lad. Dad was teaching me a bit of a lesson, is all.\u201d</p> <p>Liam\u2019s answer was evasive, but he wasn\u2019t lying about the pain. He looked awful, and so did Dylan.</p><p>Ellison had shifted back to human form but hadn\u2019t resumed his clothes. He went to Liam, helped him to his feet, put an arm around him. Sean stepped to Liam\u2019s other side, wrapped his arm around Liam\u2019s shoulder, nuzzled his cheek.</p><p>\u201cGo to him, Kim,\u201d Glory said. \u201cI\u2019ve got Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dylan?\u201d Dylan lay alone, breathing hard, his body white and gleaming with sweat.</p><p>\u201cLeave Dylan be. Liam\u2019s your mate. He needs you.\u201d</p><p>Kim gave Connor one last hug and unfolded to her feet. She never could decide whether Glory was a complete bitch or a complicated woman. Glory\u2019s tongue was sharp, but she looked up at Kim with such anguish in her eyes that Kim suddenly wanted to hug her.</p><p>She resisted and went to Liam.</p><p>Ellison relinquished his place at Liam\u2019s side to Kim. Kim kept her eyes averted from Ellison\u2019s very naked body, but Ellison didn\u2019t seem to notice or care.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to get him to the house, away from everyone,\u201d Sean said from Liam\u2019s other side.</p><p>Kim nodded. She and Sean helped Liam walk, step by shaky step, to the back porch, and inside the quiet Morrissey house. It was dark, no one having been inside since sunset, but neither she nor Sean bothered to turn on the light.</p><p>\u201cGet me to the couch,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>Kim and Sean lowered him gently. Kim took Liam\u2019s hand between hers, and Sean started to sit down next to him.</p><p>\u201cStop fussing like old biddies,\u201d Liam growled. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. You need to make sure Connor\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>\u201cGlory will see to him.\u201d Liam reached for her. \u201cPoor Kim. We\u2019ve given you a fright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re patronizing me.\u201d Kim climbed to her feet and glared at both of them. \u201cThat was some serious shit out there, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can barely talk, Liam. So be quiet. And you.\u201d Kim pointed at Sean. \u201cYou just stood there. Like you did in San Antonio when Fergus went crazy with his whip. You stood there and let them fight each other, let Connor rush in and get hurt. I thought you were supposed to be the big Guardian of the clan. Doesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re supposed to protect them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim,\u201d Liam said. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Liam,\u201d Sean answered. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo make me understand.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked at her a few moments, then lifted the sword from where it rested beside the couch. He drew it from its sheath and held the sword toward her in both hands, letting Kim see the interwoven Celtic designs etched into the hilt and blade. The workmanship was amazing, the lines featherlight, every single one part of the intricate pattern.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Shifter forged and Fae spelled. Very old, not meant for fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Guardian doesn\u2019t guard the clan,\u201d Sean said softly. \u201cI\u2019m the Guardian of the Gate. The Gate to the afterworld.\u201d</p><p>Kim dragged her gaze from the sword to look into Sean\u2019s quiet eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt used to be that the Guardian was for his pride only. But now that we\u2019ve taken the Collar, I\u2019m responsible for every Shifter in this Shiftertown. When a Shifter dies or is without hope of survival, I bring the sword. The sword frees the soul, allowing it to enter the Summerland. The Guardian makes sure the souls aren\u2019t stranded, which makes them vulnerable to be enslaved again by the Fae. I save them from that.\u201d</p><p>Kim tried to understand, to make her very practical mind believe. \u201cSo, when you stand there, watching a fight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting to see if the sword is needed. If I join in, and I\u2019m hurt or killed, there\u2019s no one else who can wield the sword. When I die, a new Guardian arises. Usually from the same family, but it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me that if Dylan had hurt Liam enough tonight, you\u2019d have stuck Liam with the sword? Turned him to dust like you did with that Shifter in my bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would have, love,\u201d Liam said. \u201cHe\u2019d have done what he needed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019d have sent him to dust,\u201d Sean agreed. \u201cJust like I did with our Kenny.\u201d Sean sheathed the sword, turned on his heel, and walked out of the house, clutching the sword in a tight hand.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kim said into the quiet. \u201cNow I feel like a complete idiot. What a thing to remind him of. I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I was just so angry at him for not helping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old hurt. My fault for not explaining about it.\u201d</p><p>Liam looked exhausted, lines etched into his tired face. Kim sat down next him, kissed his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not all right. You told me how strong your dad was, and the Collar really punished you out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Liam said, his voice nearly a whisper. \u201cYet. Can you help me up to bed, Kim? I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll be spending the rest of my mate-bonding night there. Not what I really had in mind, but eventually, I\u2019m going to feel better.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll want you next to me.\u201d</p><p>He tried to speak lightly, but Kim saw the pain in his eyes, remembered how it had clouded him the night he\u2019d saved her from the feral Shifter. She kissed his lips, softly, trying not to hurt him, then put her arm around him and helped him to his feet.</p><p>Dylan had never screwed like this before. The sofa springs dug into Glory\u2019s back, and Dylan\u2019s weight pinned her wonderfully. He drove into her hard, harder, never mind the angry scratches and bruises that covered his body. His face was set, his eyes almost feral.</p><p>She\u2019d feared that he\u2019d be enraged with her, and he was angry, but it was anger Glory didn\u2019t understand. Instead of berating her when he stormed in her back door, he\u2019d grabbed her and started sexing her before they even reached the sofa. His clothes had already been gone, and she helped him tear off her own clothes before clasping him in her arms. Now Dylan pumped into her until Glory screamed with joy, not caring if everyone in Shiftertown was still outside to hear.</p><p>She was under no illusion that Dylan loved her. Dylan still loved his mate and resented himself for what he did with Glory. Dylan tried to be kind, but Glory knew that he considered himself betraying the woman who\u2019d borne his children. His need for Glory angered him. Whenever the anger finally overrode his desires, he\u2019d refuse to see Glory for months.</p><p>Glory held on to him, feeling him slip away from her again. Damn it, why couldn\u2019t he make up his mind? He was tearing her apart.</p><p>She felt his seed as he groaned with it, and she hoped against hope that this time, she\u2019d conceive. Dylan might consider taking her as mate if she had a cub. It was more difficult to produce a baby cross-species, but it could be done, and Glory would love bearing Dylan\u2019s child.</p><p>Glory squeezed him inside her and held him close. Dylan collapsed on her, breath ragged.</p><p>The sounds of the revelry outside filtered into the house. The Shifters were enjoying themselves again. The fight was over, nothing had changed, and there was a mating ritual to celebrate. Perfect excuse to party all night.</p><p>Dylan disentangled himself from Glory and sat up, breathing hard. He ran his hands through his sweaty hair.</p><p>She loved his hair. He kept it fairly short, and it was going gray at the temples, which complemented the fine lines around his eyes. If this man could be hers...</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ask if you\u2019re all right,\u201d Glory said. Her lips were swollen, and she winced as her tongue found a cut. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be here if you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dylan didn\u2019t answer. He sat back, still catching his breath. Glory got up and went to the kitchen, gratified that when she came back with a wet towel his gaze was fixed on her naked body.</p><p>She sat next to him and started dabbing blood from his face.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Now she worried. Dylan never reverted to politeness unless things were truly bad. \u201cMy Collar gave me only one burst. It went away fast.\u201d A lie, but Glory knew that Dylan\u2019s hurting when it came would be far greater than hers. Staving off the consequences of the Collar brought worse hurt than going along with it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dylan,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize Liam would react so strongly. I thought my Collar would stop me, and he\u2019d laugh at me for being foolish.\u201d</p><p>Dylan looked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d react like that, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you leapt in to save me. My hero.\u201d</p><p>Dylan shot her a look. Glory went back to dabbing his wounds. \u201cIt\u2019s over now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wrestled, you stopped the fight. I\u2019m sorry about Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor needs to learn to back off until he\u2019s fully grown.\u201d Dylan paused. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t stop the fight. Liam did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam backed down. I saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dylan\u2019s words were flat. \u201cLiam stopped the fight, because he was winning it.\u201d</p><p>Glory froze, and the cloth dripped water on her bare thighs. \u201cGoddess, are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sure, love. Liam stopped before he could hurt me. If this had happened before the Collar, he\u2019d have killed me.\u201d Dylan closed his eyes and rested his head on the back of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p> Dylan gave a mirthless laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything to him. I can\u2019t. He\u2019s my son, and he\u2019s mated now. It\u2019s up to him.\u201d He opened his eyes. \u201cIf you say anything, tell anyone, I\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>She liked that he didn\u2019t finish the sentence. When a Shifter said, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d he meant it. Dylan wouldn\u2019t say it casually. \u201cLike I would. I keep your secrets, Dylan.\u201d</p><p>Dylan\u2019s look softened, and he closed his eyes again. \u201cThank you. I know you do. The Collar\u2019s going to pay me back now. You might want to go out to the party. This won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p> <p>Dylan reached out and took her hand. Glory twined her fingers through his, her heart thumping. Dylan\u2019s body shuddered as the pain started to flow. A tear slid from his tightly closed eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d Liam said. As though all the agony in the world was twisting his body to one fine point.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Kim knelt on his bed next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou being here with me is good.\u201d Liam broke off as a spasm rocked him. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p> <p>Kim put her arms around him. Liam loved that she instinctively knew he needed her warmth and closeness. Nothing else would get him through this.</p><p>\u201cThat was one hell of a fight,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWhy did you have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory attacked my mate. The beast inside me had to stop her.\u201d He grimaced as another wave rocketed through him.</p><p>\u201cHer Collar activated right away. She knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, my brain reasons that now. But at the time, the feral Shifter in me wanted nothing more than to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your father tried to protect Glory. Is that it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it in one, love.\u201d Liam tried to smile, though the muscles of his mouth didn\u2019t want to move. \u201cThe big liar. I knew Dad cared about her more than he let on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, isn\u2019t it? Even though you two had to tear each other up to learn it?\u201d</p><p>Liam looked into her honest eyes and felt something break inside him. He knew what had happened in the fight, something far more significant than learning that his father liked Glory more than he admitted.</p><p>Dylan had felt it too. Liam had seen what was in his father\u2019s eyes when they pulled apart.</p><p>Defeat.</p><p>The wildcat inside Liam wanted to roar his triumph. The pride was his. Liam was mated, powerful, and he\u2019d just bested the only one in Shiftertown stronger than himself.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGoddess help me.\u201d</p><p>Kim kneaded his shoulders. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p> <p>She thought he meant the Collar. The Collar was nothing compared to the grief that now twisted him, warring with the fierce joy of his victory. It was nothing to the heartbreak of what he\u2019d seen in his father.</p><p>Fear. Dylan feared him.</p><p>\u201cKim. I\u2019ve just screwed everything all to hell.\u201d Liam pulled her down on top of him, held her close, and explained in a low, rapid voice what had happened.</p><p>Liam\u2019s descent to breakfast the next morning was difficult for three reasons. First because he was sore as hell\u2014from the fight with his father and the Collar\u2019s payback, then from sex with Kim, as gentle as it had been. Second, because Kim lay snuggled and cute in his bed, sound asleep. Third, because he\u2019d have to face Dylan.</p><p>In the space of a few seconds last night, Liam\u2019s entire life had changed. He didn\u2019t know what to do about it, or even how he felt about it. The turmoil of emotions and thoughts nauseated him.</p><p>He descended the stairs, scrubbing his hand through his wet hair. He\u2019d showered twice, once last night with Kim while she washed his cuts, which had led to water all over the bathroom floor. There was something about bathrooms and Kim. The second time was this morning after he\u2019d left the bed.</p><p>Dylan leaned on his elbows on the breakfast bar, drinking coffee and reading a newspaper. Morning sunlight winked on his Collar.</p><p>\u201cDid Fergus oust you yet?\u201d Liam asked, as he headed for the coffeepot. They didn\u2019t have a coffee-maker, not because it was forbidden to Shifters, but because they\u2019d never taken to anything but coffee brewed right in the pot.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t heard from him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be along.\u201d</p><p>Liam poured coffee. \u201cWhere have Sean and Connor got to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we could talk.\u201d</p><p>Liam took a sip and grimaced. \u201cSean must have made this.\u201d Sean, terrific at the griddle, lousy at the brew-up.</p><p>\u201cFergus has to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Sean made the damned coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Both men fell silent. Liam cradled his cup while Dylan pretended to read the newspaper. Liam had never heard Dylan come in last night; Glory must have been comforting him the way Kim had comforted Liam.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d Dylan asked without looking up.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re fine. I don\u2019t mind you reading the paper.\u201d Liam stopped pretending. \u201cYou mean for good, don\u2019t you? Why should you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy own father died before we found out whether I could best him. Defeated males had two choices back then\u2014be killed or cast out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Dylan turned a page. \u201cI knew in my heart it would happen to me sooner or later. I didn\u2019t think it would be last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never finished the fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing.\u201d Dylan finally looked up at him. The man was much too calm. His eyes were watchful, but other than that, he rested against the counter, the cuts on his face already healing. \u201cIf it had been obvious that you\u2019d bested me, Fergus would be up here demanding to fight you, to establish his dominance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust her then?\u201d</p><p>Dylan gave him a thin smile. \u201cI might have to move in with the woman. I thought it only fair that she knew why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Dad. You don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re not feral anymore. We don\u2019t have to disembowel each other to make a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re too civilized for disemboweling,\u201d Dylan said in a dry voice. \u201cThe choice is yours, Liam. I don\u2019t mind going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Liam slammed his cup to the counter and it broke. Hot coffee spilled on his hands and spattered on his thighs. \u201cI don\u2019t want you going. Why the hell should you? You belong here.\u201d</p><p>Dylan left his newspaper, caught Liam\u2019s shoulders in his big hands. \u201cIt\u2019s natural, son. It happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that.\u201d</p><p>Dylan pulled him close. Liam resisted the hug, wanting to push him away. All his life he\u2019d felt protected and confident because Dylan and his strength was there. Even when Dylan had disappeared to grieve, his protection had permeated the walls of their castle, and Liam had known Dylan would return. He\u2019d never doubted.</p><p>When they\u2019d come to America, a land they\u2019d never seen, and during the torture of taking the Collar, Dylan had been there. Dylan was the anchor in the madness of Liam\u2019s life, in the chaos of the world.</p><p>Last night, the moment Liam\u2019s wildcat had known he could destroy Dylan anytime he wanted to, that world had changed. Gone was the ground beneath Liam\u2019s feet, the tie to sanity. The abyss howled at him, and now he\u2019d have to face it alone.</p><p>Liam jerked away. He and Dylan were the same height; he could look his father straight in the eye. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Fergus. Not yet. I don\u2019t want him coming after you.\u201d</p><p>Dylan nodded, and Liam tamped down his anger with difficulty. Primal rage made him want Fergus in front of him, right now. Liam would make the man eat his f**king whip.</p><p>\u201cIs this the true reason you never would fight Fergus?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cBecause you knew once you\u2019d bested him, I\u2019d be compelled to best you?\u201d</p><p>Dylan waited a silent moment, then nodded.</p><p>The enormity of the knowledge was enough to make Liam sick. He had always thought Dylan held back from challenging Fergus to keep the peace in Shiftertown, because living life and raising the children were more important than fights for dominance. Liam had agreed, believed it with all his heart. Now Dylan was confessing that part of the reason he\u2019d kept himself from fighting Fergus was simple fear.</p><p>When a clan leader died, usually the second in line stepped into his place without fuss, unless a Shifter close to the second knew that he could vie for leadership. Other Shifters down the line might fight among themselves to move up a place or two, and a series of fights could happen until the pecking order settled again. Typically the hierarchy didn\u2019t change, but sometimes a young Shifter grew more dominant or an older Shifter weakened and moved down. Dylan had realized that Liam\u2019s natural dominance would emerge the instant Fergus was gone, that Liam wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop himself from challenging his father.</p><p>\u201cShite, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus will have to know sometime,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>\u201cWe wait. We\u2019ll tell him on our own terms, when we\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Dylan nodded once. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Liam loved his father so damn much, and now his instincts were telling him to push Dylan out, take over his power. The Collars might keep Shifters from being violent, but they didn\u2019t take away the fiery urge to dominate.</p><p>Dylan knew it too. His instincts must have been telling him to cut and run, get out while the going was good. By the white lines around his mouth, Liam knew he was resisting the urge with difficulty.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you warn me this was coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped it wouldn\u2019t happen for a few more years, that we\u2019d both have time to prepare. But claiming a mate triggered something in you. You\u2019re the oldest son. Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know that one day you\u2019d take over the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be now, and I didn\u2019t think it would hurt so much.\u201d</p><p>Dylan smiled. \u201cYour mother would be proud of you for showing compassion. For not throwing me out with your bare hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum was too damn good for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>Liam met his gaze and said something that would have gotten him knocked across the room before today. \u201cShe\u2019d want you to be with Glory. She\u2019d want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it, Liam.\u201d</p><p>Liam wanted to laugh, but he was wound up too tight. His dad might have switched places with him in the hierarchy, but that didn\u2019t mean the man was a wimp.</p><p>Liam grabbed Dylan in a bear hug, then released him abruptly and left the house.</p><p>Even in the embrace, Liam\u2019s instincts had kicked in, urging him to remind his father who now ran the pride. Liam needed some distance from his father to get used to his new position, to learn to control himself.</p><p>He looked back and saw Kim peering down at him from his bedroom window, but even that couldn\u2019t make him stay.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Kim found Liam in a sorry excuse for a park on the far side of Shiftertown. He sat on a low brick wall next to the only trees in the somewhat bare strip of land, hands braced on the top of the wall.</p><p>The park had one swing set for kids, no picnic tables, and bald patches where grass should grow. The city had tacked the park onto Shiftertown as an afterthought, then forgotten about it. The Shifters didn\u2019t use it much, from what she\u2019d seen, seeming to prefer the common greens behind their houses.</p><p>Kim approached Liam slowly but determinedly, wondering if he\u2019d stand up and walk away. He didn\u2019t. Liam didn\u2019t look at her, either, as she sat down next to him and stretched out her bare legs. The summer warmth felt good on them, though she knew the day soon would turn excruciatingly hot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs this your place?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe place you go when you want to think. My place is a coffeehouse on the river that sits right on the water. You can suck down a latte and watch the river go by. It\u2019s soothing.\u201d</p><p>Liam looked into the distance. \u201cI\u2019m thinking they wouldn\u2019t be letting Shifters in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not. But this is your place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was a convenient spot to sit my sorry ass down.\u201d</p><p>Kim let it go. She wasn\u2019t sure she should have followed Liam, but what she\u2019d overheard of his conversation with Dylan confused and bothered her. She didn\u2019t understand fully what Liam had explained about him knowing he was now dominant to Dylan, but she sensed the tension, the violence simmering below the surface. A person didn\u2019t have to be a Shifter to feel it.</p><p>She argued with herself that maybe Liam wanted to be alone, but something inside told her she shouldn\u2019t leave him by himself. His shoulders were tight, arms knotted, his mouth a rigid line. As usual, Liam kept his words light, almost careless, but the darkness in his eyes spoke volumes.</p><p>Kim sat in silence with him. Birds chattered in the trees, but otherwise, the park was quiet. No kids came to swing, and no cars turned down the quiet street beyond it. She heard faint sounds of the city on the other side of the derelict block beyond Shiftertown, Austinites heading to the city to make money or play politics. Here in Shiftertown, power that humans didn\u2019t understand ebbed and flowed in ways they\u2019d never realize.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she ventured. \u201cI mean from having your Collar go off and...well, everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re referring to the exuberant and athletic sex we had later?\u201d A ghost of a smile touched Liam\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s why I had to sit down.\u201d</p><p>Kim covered his hand, feeling the tension in it. \u201cLiam, last night was my fault. I was the one who wanted to bring Silas here. There never would have been a Collar demonstration if I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Liam touched her fingers to his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t fret yourself, sweetheart. I agreed to invite Silas. It\u2019s my fault for encouraging his questions about the Collars. I didn\u2019t anticipate Glory jumping in, damn the lass, or that Conner would get hurt or that anything very dramatic would happen. My thought was that I\u2019d grab for Silas, let my Collar spark, and have everyone laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaugh at you in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in pain before, and I\u2019ve gotten over it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLiam...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s between me and Dad would have happened sooner or later, love, and maybe it was best the fight occurred with you and Connor and your journalist watching so avidly. You all gave me the strength to break it off. If me and Dad had been alone, it might have turned deadly before I could shut down my instincts.\u201d He smiled, a little shaky. \u201cSo maybe I should be thanking you instead.\u201d</p><p>Kim caressed his fingers with her thumb. \u201cDon\u2019t make me feel worse, damn it.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnd on top of it all, I have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fear I\u2019d let you go alone, darling. Not with you flagrantly disobeying Fergus every second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted me to keep helping Brian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I was referring to your lack of stealth. I know why you\u2019re such a good defender. You\u2019re so honest it glows from you. When you say the man didn\u2019t do it, everyone wants to believe he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish it were that simple. Every i has to be dotted and every t crossed. You miss one, the case goes the other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandra is visiting Brian this morning, and she\u2019s going to ask if he was ready to take Michelle as mate. Sandra\u2019s grateful to you for believing in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Kim asked. \u201cHer looks of hatred are false impressions, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s afraid. Fergus has put fear into her, and she doesn\u2019t know why. All she knows is that she\u2019s been told to sacrifice her son.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cFor a mother to lose her child\u2014I can only imagine how it feels. If it\u2019s anything like losing a brother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s pretty shitty.\u201d</p><p>Liam ran a hand through Kim\u2019s hair. \u201cIt would be like losing you.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse sped. \u201cNot the same thing at all. We barely know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know a lot about each other. I know you have a little mole on the inside of your right thigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither was I.\u201d Liam turned and straddled the wall, pulling her between his thighs. \u201cMating doesn\u2019t mean going at it until we have a litter of cubs. It means a bond that no one breaks. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a marriage humans would recognize or sanction,\u201d Kim pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDamn, woman, will you stop shoving everything into your legal terms? I\u2019m not talking about the bits of paper humans love so much. It\u2019s a bond inside us, stretching between us. Nothing can sever it, not human law or my family, or bloody Fergus. Are you telling me you don\u2019t feel it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes held anger, fear, hope, and something raw\u2014all fighting inside him.</p><p>Did Kim feel the bond? Of course she did. This man was compelling and mesmerizing, with his blue eyes and lilting voice, not to mention his hot body. But it was more than his sexiness and his strength.</p><p>Liam dominated any room he walked into without saying a word. Every Shifter Kim met was drawn to Liam, every Shifter hero-worshipped him, even if they might not admit it. Anyone who had troubles went to him. Even the kids did, like little Michael in his pool. Michael had called out to Liam, had been excited to tell Liam of his achievements. He\u2019d wanted Liam\u2019s approval.</p><p>Kim remembered Liam\u2019s words to the boy\u2014\u201cyou look after your brother, now.\u201d Kim realized now he\u2019d not been making an offhand remark. Liam, who had lost a brother, knew the importance of taking care of those you loved.</p><p>Liam took care of everyone in Shiftertown, even more than Dylan did. Kim had always sensed that, and she knew that Dylan had too, and had let it happen. Not because Dylan feared losing to Liam, but because Dylan loved him.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d never come here,\u201d she said.</p><p>Liam stroked her bare leg, his fingers sliding beneath the hem of her skirt. \u201cWhy is that, love? Me, I\u2019m glad you walked into my bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve messed up my mind. I was independent, didn\u2019t worry about anyone but myself. When I went home at the end of the day, I could do whatever I wanted. Hang out with friends, watch TV, be alone, whatever. And now I\u2019m worried about you\u2014and Sean, and Connor, and your father, and Brian and Sandra, and every other Shifter in this damned Shiftertown. Even Glory.\u201d She glared at him. \u201cStop making me care. It\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s fingers moved farther under the skirt. \u201cThen you do care?\u201d His eyes held heat. \u201cI\u2019m not dreaming that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I care. Who could help caring about you? But we\u2019re still not married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNot in the marriage license kind of way. You\u2019re my mate, Kim. I have you and no other.\u201d Liam rubbed the small of her back, his body warmer than the Texas sunshine. \u201cWill you have me, and no other?\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s heart pounded. Forsaking all others, as long as you both shall live. \u201cThere is no other for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not now. But what if some human male, some high-powered lawyer in your firm, decides to make you his wife? His prize? So you can flash your beautiful legs at his parties and draw people to his side?\u201d</p><p>Kim shook with nervous laughter. \u201cHis prize? Thanks a lot. Besides, I don\u2019t like high-powered lawyers. They take credit for cases I win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked you when I met you, Liam, but what I feel now, it\u2019s gone far beyond like.\u201d Kim leaned against his chest as his seeking fingers found the elastic of her underwear. \u201cBut you\u2019re asking me for commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to ask. The mate-bond does it for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it does for Shifters. Not for humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifter-human pairings happen sometimes. We\u2019d never have survived all these centuries if the gene pool had remained pure. Inbreeding makes for weakness. Mongrels survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMongrels. You sweet talker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re doing too much of the talking.\u201d</p><p>The leg band of her panties moved aside, and strong fingers touched the moisture between her legs.</p><p>Kim glanced around. \u201cWe\u2019re outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we?\u201d He sounded amazed.</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t object to sex, and in college she\u2019d once done it in a car, but that had been late at night in a deserted parking lot. This was broad daylight in the middle of thriving Shiftertown.</p><p>Liam leaned down and pressed an openmouthed kiss to her throat, making Kim\u2019s body hotter. She was wet, she was naughty, and she loved it.</p><p>Liam drew his tongue up her chin and kissed her mouth. His kissing skills had certainly progressed. He knew how to part her lips, how to stroke his tongue inside her, how to make her mouth tingle.</p><p>\u201cThis is bad,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to unbutton your pants right here on the street,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d call that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur notions of bad and good are the exact opposite, then.\u201d</p><p>Kim gave in and popped the button of his jeans. His c**k was hard behind his underwear, the tip reaching past the waistband. Kim slid her fingers inside the elastic and grasped the full shaft.</p><p>Liam groaned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the touch, love.\u201d</p><p>Kim slid her thumb over the crown, and Liam\u2019s fingers moved between her legs. She\u2019d never thought she could get turned on sitting on a wall, but Liam also had the touch. More than the touch. She found herself rocking back, closing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, baby.\u201d</p><p>He was, all eleven inches of him. Not that she\u2019d measured, but she could guess. She ran her hand along Liam\u2019s penis, gripping it all the way down. He moved his hips, face softening in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cLove, you don\u2019t know what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a pretty good idea. I make you stiff and hard, and when I touch you, you want to screw me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were slits. \u201cYou\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t want to screw me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I want to screw you all the time, whether you\u2019re touching me or not. I want to lift your pretty skirt and do you right now.\u201d</p><p>Excitement spiked through her. \u201cRight here on the wall?\u201d she asked in an innocent voice.</p><p>\u201cRight here on the wall.\u201d</p><p>Liam half stood, and she lost her hold of him. The next thing she knew, his jeans were around his thighs, her underwear was gone, he was sitting on the wall again, and he\u2019d pulled her down to straddle him. Her skirt hid their mutual bareness, but only just.</p><p>She opened her mouth to admonish him, but he kissed her. The wicked look in his eyes both excited her and made her want to laugh.</p><p>She\u2019d never gone out with a man as in-your-face as Liam. He was a Shifter, restricted and shunned, but he was better at doing whatever he damn well pleased than anyone she\u2019d ever met.</p><p>Right now, he was doing her on a wall in the middle of a park. In broad daylight. As he went deep, he pulled her close and kissed her.</p><p>Words flew through Kim\u2019s mind, then dissolved. This wasn\u2019t about words. It was feeling, pure, basic, raw feeling.</p><p>Liam was opening her like he never had before. The sun on her thighs excited her as much as his hardness inside her, a hardness that stretched and widened her. This was free and wild and strange. Sweat rolled in a bead between her br**sts, and he leaned forward and licked it away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His breath came fast, and so did hers. Liam\u2019s fingers were hard points on her thighs, then her back, her bu**ocks, her face. He pressed into her, fast, faster, his mouth twisting in pleasure.</p><p>Kim\u2019s head dropped back. She bit back her scream, not wanting people to come rushing out to see what was going on. Liam licked between her br**sts again, his breath scalding. \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he whispered into her skin.</p><p>So was she. White-hot waves of excitement poured through her, blotting out everything but the feeling of Liam joined to her.</p><p>He took her face between his hands. His eyes had gone Shifter, the predator wanting her. Then he gave a strangled groan and shot everything he had into her.</p> <p>Shaking and sweaty, Kim clasped him to her br**sts and kissed his hair. I love you, Liam, she wanted to whisper, but she kissed his hair again and rested her cheek on his head.</p><p>Liam insisted on accompanying her to work, and Kim was fine with that today. Having him next to her in her car, though, his dark sunglasses trained at the world going by, distracted her.</p><p>Kim\u2019s body felt warm and supple, aching slightly from having to spread so far for him. Liam caught Kim looking at him, and he reached over and laid his hand on her thigh. He didn\u2019t have to say a word. Kim felt the connection between them, the warmth that wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>Kim earned a few stares when they walked in. She was: one, late; two, not in a suit; and three, shadowed by her tall Shifter with menacing eyes.</p><p>She was starting to dress like a Shifter woman, she realized as she sat down and sorted through her messages. She never came to work outside of a skirt suit, stockings, and black pumps. She\u2019d changed out of the clothes she\u2019d made love in, but had put on another loose skirt and blouse and high-heeled sandals. Clothing easy to remove.</p> <p>She sensed that the last thing Liam had wanted to do this morning was leave Shiftertown, but he\u2019d been adamant about not letting her go to work alone. Last night he and his father had switched places in Shifter hierarchy, which meant he could go one-on-one with Fergus now\u2014a fight that might end in Liam\u2019s death.</p><p>The entire balance of Shifter power in South Texas was at stake. Liam showed how torn he was about this by stretching out on her sofa and catching up on the latest issue of Angler Today.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop that?\u201d she asked in irritation.</p><p>\u201cStop what? Reading\u2019s good for you. You learn things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSitting there like nothing\u2019s wrong. I might have made a breakthrough in the case. Your dad might have to leave Shiftertown. Fergus might try to kick your ass into the next county. And you read about fishing. Do Shifters fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim, sweetheart, if I didn\u2019t absorb myself in fishing lures, I\u2019d either tear down the building or come over there and screw you senseless on your desk. Maybe both. Is that what you want? I can oblige.\u201d</p> <p>Kim scrubbed her hand through her hair. \u201cNever mind. You have me on edge. I guess the Shifter pheromone thing really works.\u201d</p><p>Liam was off the couch and on his feet, the magazine falling to the floor. \u201cAnd yours are pouring over me, enticing me to come and slide my hands up your skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was two hours ago. I want to do it again. And again. All day and all night. It burns like fury.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s blood heated. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m turned off by that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re not Shifter. You can\u2019t feel the mating frenzy like I do. If you were Shifter, we\u2019d have been doing it constantly since San Antonio. To hell with work or family, or eating and sleeping.\u201d Tension rippled through his big body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been feeling that since San Antonio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes. I want to be inside you every second. Fergus and his demands, your case, and even my father can go to hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Kim moved closer to him. She was in her office, her very formal, law-firm office in its nice building in downtown Austin, and she wanted nothing more than for Liam to throw everything off the desk and lay her back on it. Or maybe sit her on the edge. Or against the wall. She wasn\u2019t particular.</p><p>Liam\u2019s smile was feral. \u201cDon\u2019t play with fire, Kim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I have a little of this mating frenzy too.\u201d Kim pressed her hands to his chest to feel his heart pounding beneath her fingertips. \u201cI want to touch you all the time, have you kiss me, have you be with me. I didn\u2019t say that, because I was afraid you\u2019d think I was clingy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy love, what gobshite wouldn\u2019t want you clinging to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much everything male.\u201d</p><p>Liam drew her against him. \u201cBloody fools can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of their own noses. It means you\u2019re all mine.\u201d</p><p>Kim rose to meet his kiss, not caring that her secretary could pop in any moment, not to mention all the lawyers in the building. But what the hell? She\u2019d already done it outside on a wall, and her colleagues probably thought she was shagging the Shifter in here anyway.</p><p>The kiss turned deep. Kim tasted his need, the frenzy inside him, and his conflicted emotions. Likely his heartbreak was fueling his sexual needs, and Kim would be the one fulfilling those needs. She somehow couldn\u2019t be sorry about that.</p><p>Liam\u2019s cell phone buzzed. He kept kissing her a few seconds, then reluctantly reached for the phone. \u201cDamn it.\u201d He flipped it open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His expression changed, and he turned away, shutting Kim out. She thought the voice she could barely hear was Sean\u2019s, and from the stiffening of Liam\u2019s body, something had happened.</p><p>Her heart froze. Dylan? Or Connor?</p><p>Liam snapped the phone shut and turned to her with a grim look. \u201cMichael\u2019s mum says he\u2019s missing. She can\u2019t find him anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Kim blinked. \u201cMichael? The little kid with the pool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Dad and Sean are organizing a search.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s blood went cold. \u201cFergus?\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, and neither does Dad. Fergus\u2019s head would come off if he tried to hurt a cub, or even use him as a diversion. Fergus has power, but cubs are sacrosanct.\u201d</p><p>Kim wasn\u2019t sure she took Liam\u2019s word for it. \u201cCall the police,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cThey\u2019ll do one of those alerts...\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head. \u201cShifters can find him a hell of a lot faster than your police can. We know his scent.\u201d Liam slid his phone back into his belt. \u201cI have to be there. His mum and dad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill need you.\u201d Kim thought of the way Liam and Sean had done everything to calm Sandra, how the woman had relaxed somewhat under their mutual touch. The parents would be terrified, need reassurance. \u201cGo then. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>More conflict. Liam looked uncertain, and Kim had never seen him uncertain. \u201cReally,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a hell of a lot to do here. You know, Brian\u2019s butt to save. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Liam came to her, his hard body against hers the best thing in the world. \u201cYou stay in this office, all right? Have someone bring you lunch; don\u2019t go out. And after work get into your car and drive straight to my house. No stopping, no lingering. All right?\u201d</p><p>Uneasiness stole through her. \u201cFine. I can do that.\u201d</p><p>Liam pulled her into an embrace. A Shifter embrace, tight, long, warm, comforting and drawing comfort at the same time. \u201cI hate to leave you.\u201d</p><p>Kim hated for him to leave her too. When did she get so needy? \u201cI\u2019m fine. Go.\u201d</p><p>Liam kissed her again, lips lingering on hers. \u201cYou call me,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery hour if you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right, Liam.\u201d</p><p>Liam gave her a hint of a smile. \u201cI wish I could believe that, love.\u201d And then he was gone.</p><p>Kim tried to concentrate on work but found her attention wandering to Shiftertown. She had much to catch up on, phone calls to return, reports from her investigator on Michelle\u2019s ex to go through, letters to compose. But she worried about Michael\u2014had he merely wandered off or had something more sinister happened? Was he exploring some place exciting to small Shifter boys; was there another feral Shifter on the loose?</p><p>Liam hadn\u2019t been gone an hour before she was on the phone to him. He told her, his voice warm as ever, that he had nothing to report. Apparently, Michael\u2019s mother had stepped inside for a minute, when his little brother had come running to the front porch to tell her that Michael was gone. Early searches had turned up nothing. All Shiftertown was now about to start a serious one.</p><p>Kim heard the worry in Liam\u2019s voice. This happening, on top of his fight with his father and Fergus\u2019s threats, couldn\u2019t be easy on him.</p><p>When had she started caring so much? Her fascination with Shifters, her first attraction to Liam, her growing physical need for him had blossomed into something much deeper. It was more than the mating frenzy Liam kept talking about. There was something about Liam that made her want to be near him, to hold him when he hurt, to laugh with him when he was happy.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut. Damn it all, I\u2019ve fallen in love with him. When did I get so stupid?</p><p>Kim tried to return to work. She couldn\u2019t bother Liam; he\u2019d have his hands full. But she couldn\u2019t help calling him back as she ate lunch at her desk. Nothing, Liam reported.</p><p>He sounded even grimmer. Kim assured him that she was all right\u2014no need to worry about her. He told her to take care, warmth in every word. When Liam said the trite phrase, he really meant it.</p><p>Kim called Liam back at two, but he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Leave him alone, she told herself. He\u2019s busy doing his job.</p><p>To think she\u2019d once assumed his job was managing a bar.</p><p>By three, Kim couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She packed her briefcase and told Jeanne, her secretary, that she\u2019d work the rest of the day at home.</p><p>Kim hurried out into the parking lot to nearly run into Abel, who was returning from a day in court. \u201cKim,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Abel. I gotta go. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Abel stepped in front of her. He was perspiring, his face red and shiny above his tight suit coat. He looked furious, which meant he must have lost his case.</p><p>\u201cI heard that you dumped me for a Shifter.\u201d</p><p>The boy wonder had finally caught on. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>He stepped in front of her again. \u201cWhere to? Your Shifter? That stinking animal you dragged in here? You\u2019re screwing him, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re screwing an animal.\u201d</p><p>Kim rolled her eyes. \u201cYou were always so clueless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you fired. I\u2019ll get you disbarred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not against the law to go out with a Shifter. Or even to go to bed with one. Grow up, Abel.\u201d</p><p>Kim tried to go around him again, and again, Abel barred her way. After meeting Fergus, Abel frightened Kim about as much as a gnat, but she wondered what he was going to do. Deck her in the parking lot? Great PR for the law firm.</p><p>\u201cWould you get out of the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you doing him while you were going out with me? Tell me the truth. You were already screwing him then, weren\u2019t you? You were double-dipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you want me to say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifter-whore,\u201d Abel said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell everyone I know that you\u2019re nothing but a Shifter-whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbel, you moron...\u201d</p><p>She broke off as two Shifters materialized on either side of Abel. Fergus\u2019s thugs\u2014bald Tattoo Guy and Military Man. Their Collars glinted in the hot sunlight. Military Man wore sunglasses and looked like the Terminator.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, Ms. Fraser?\u201d Tattoo Guy asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine. I\u2019m heading to my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll walk you there.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s heart started to pound. \u201cNo need, I can make it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Military Man stepped to block Abel, while Tattoo Guy motioned for Kim to go. \u201cWant us to teach him some manners?\u201d Tattoo Guy asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, leave him alone,\u201d Kim said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a dickhead.\u201d</p><p>Tattoo Guy shrugged as if he didn\u2019t care one way or another. Abel beat a retreat into the building, and Kim started for her car, which was only a few feet away. The two of them fell into step beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhen Shifters don\u2019t wear Collars,\u201d Tattoo Guy said, \u201cassholes like that will be wetting themselves to be nice to us.\u201d</p> <p>Sure. Kim quickened her pace, but she reached the car without incident. The two men didn\u2019t try to grab her or drag her off; in fact, they acted more as though they were protecting her. Whose side were they on? Military Man opened her car door for her, shutting it again once she was settled. \u201cDrive carefully, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Kim said as she started up.</p><p>\u201cHey, no one messes with our females,\u201d Military Man said. \u201cYou\u2019re Liam\u2019s now.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure whether to be reassured or irritated. \u201cThank you, gentlemen,\u201d she said. \u201cI appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>She firmly rolled up the windows and backed out of her parking space. The two followed her to Shiftertown on their motorcycles, keeping pace with her, again, protectively.</p> <p>Kim was halfway to Shiftertown when Tattoo Guy\u2019s words struck her. When Shifters don\u2019t wear Collars. What the hell did that mean? He\u2019d said the words as though it was a real time to come, not wishful thinking.</p><p>Kim gripped the steering wheel and kept driving. She\u2019d have to ask Liam whether the man was simply blowing off steam\u2014if Liam would ever answer his damn phone.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Liam walked around the next block of derelict and empty buildings. The brick walls were battered and worn, and rotted boards covered broken-out windows.</p><p>A place like this might attract a curious kid who\u2019d decided to head out on his own. Liam remembered how he, Sean, and Kenny had liked to explore the ruins of castles\u2014Ireland was full of them\u2014crumbling stones barely held together of some long-forgotten keep. Did they care that it was dangerous, that they could get trapped, buried, crushed by unexpected rock fall?</p><p>Not really. They were Shifters. Tough, dangerous, bold.</p> <p>\u201cBloody stupid,\u201d Liam said under his breath. No wonder their mum had raised hell with them.</p><p>He turned a corner between buildings and heard Michael crying.</p><p>The sound came from the warehouse beside him, the wide door covered with planks of old wood. Liam kicked apart the wood, mildewed and rotted, and it broke easily.</p><p>The warehouse inside was dim, the concrete floor pitted and covered with dust. A metal door made of new, shining, solid steel, gleamed in the wall to his right. Its handle was wrapped in chains and padlocked. Banging came from behind it, along with two voices\u2014Michael\u2019s high-pitched wail and the shouts of a man he didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>Liam\u2019s nostrils widened as he took the scent of the air. Nothing but terror from Michael and the man behind this door, overlaid by the decay of the building. Even if this was a trick to trap Liam for some reason, it was certain that the prisoners hadn\u2019t padlocked themselves into the room from the outside.</p><p>Liam wrapped the hem of his shirt around the padlock, let his hand shift to strong Shifter claws, and broke the lock. He swung the door open, backing up quickly when a wave of fetid air poured from the tiny room beyond.</p><p>A man rushed out and collapsed on the floor outside his makeshift cell, breathing hard. His hair was tangled and matted, and his clothes were rank. A Lupine, by his eyes and smell, but Liam didn\u2019t know him. Michael rushed out behind him, his hands manacled, and Liam gathered the boy up in his arms. Michael clung to him, soaking up all the comfort he could.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get locked in there?\u201d he asked Michael.</p> <p>\u201cThe bad man brought me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bad man, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Feline captured me.\u201d The man on the floor glared up at him with bloodshot eyes. \u201cLike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich Feline? Fergus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That wasn\u2019t his name.\u201d The stranger pushed himself to his feet, screwing up his eyes against even the dim light. \u201cOh, yeah, Brian. That was it.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s blood froze. \u201cBrian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said. Then this morning, some other Feline opens up the door and throws this little guy in with me. I\u2019m glad you came when you did. I was getting hungry, and the Feline said I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat.\u201d</p><p>The Shifter\u2019s gaze moved to Michael. The boy wasn\u2019t timid, but when those bloodshot Lupine eyes landed on him, he backed away fast until he crouched into a dusty corner. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with him, Liam,\u201d Michael whimpered.</p><p>The Lupine moved out into the light, and Liam saw clearly that instead of a Collar, a line of blood-blackened bare skin ran around his neck. His Collar had been removed.</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d Liam said. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>Eyes round with terror, the boy scuttled away. Liam grabbed the Lupine by the shoulder, spinning him around. The Lupine snarled and leapt, and Liam met the attack.</p><p>The two fell to the ground, Liam\u2019s hands becoming claws. They fought, Liam trying to sever the feral\u2019s spine. The feral reared up and brought down a most unlikely weapon\u2014a hypodermic needle. Before Liam could roll aside, the feral plunged the needle into his shoulder.</p><p>Liam fought a few more seconds, and then his muscles went slack and he couldn\u2019t move at all. He didn\u2019t black out, but he prayed hard in the next hours for unconsciousness to come.</p><p>At first glance Shiftertown seemed to be in chaos. Shifters roamed everywhere in parties of two and three, calling Michael\u2019s name. Shifters on motorcycles and in ratty cars cruised the streets both inside and on the outskirts of Shiftertown, moving slowly and peering into the shadows of every building.</p><p>When Kim entered the Morrissey house, she realized that the searching had been organized in almost military fashion. Dylan stood alone in the kitchen, a map of Shiftertown and its environs spread across the table. A careful grid had been drawn on the map. Dylan\u2019s cell phone was at his ear, and he marked off squares in the grid as he talked to the person on the other end.</p><p>Dylan spotted Kim. \u201cKim\u2019s here,\u201d he said into the phone. \u201cAnd Nate and Spike. Come back to the house and pick up Kim. Nate and Spike will make up another team.\u201d</p><p>Nate and Spike? Tattoo Guy and Military Man were dismounting their motorcycles at the front curb. Kim briefly wondered which was which.</p><p>Dylan hung up his phone, came to Kim, and enfolded her in his arms. Shifter greeting. They\u2019re tense; I bet they need a lot of reassurance right now.</p><p>Kim returned the hug, squeezing Dylan hard before releasing him. \u201cWere you talking to Liam? Where is he?\u201d</p><p>Dylan shook his head. \u201cSean. Liam hasn\u2019t checked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t answer his cell phone, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCell phone service isn\u2019t the most reliable around here. He\u2019ll find a way to call when he has something to report. Sean\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d Dylan turned back to his map. \u201cI want you and Sean to make up a team. Sean\u2019s the strongest, next to Liam, and I don\u2019t want to worry about you on top of everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam told me what happened,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cAbout you and him, and the fight.\u201d</p><p>Dylan turned from the map again. He didn\u2019t look conquered. He was as tall and formidable as ever, only the touch of gray at his temples betraying that he was older than his sons. He radiated strength, competence, and decisiveness\u2014everything you\u2019d want in a general.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant right now,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>Meaning they\u2019d talk about it once Michael was found. \u201cI just wondered what was going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to Liam.\u201d Dylan looked past her, and she realized that Nate and Spike were approaching the front door.</p><p>Kim shut up, and Dylan invited the two inside. The hostility they\u2019d exhibited to Dylan in San Antonio was absent as the three bent over the map. Nate turned out to be the military guy, and the shaved-headed, tattooed man was Spike.</p><p>The two Shifters left with their orders, and Dylan took another phone call. Sean approached through the backyard, and Kim went out to meet him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Connor?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSearching with Glory and Ellison. Dad\u2019s putting you with me.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked grim, flat black sunglasses hiding his eyes, his sword hilt protruding over his shoulder. Kim knew without being told that his greatest fear was that he\u2019d have to use the sword on Michael when and if they found him.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Liam?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t worry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. But Liam\u2019s one of the strongest in the clan, and if he\u2019s out of communication, it\u2019s for a good reason.\u201d</p><p>His words made sense, and so had Dylan\u2019s. But Kim shivered, some feeling in her gut bothering her. \u201cWe should find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should find Michael.\u201d</p><p>Kim nodded. Michael\u2019s mother must be going through hell. Kim remembered how her own mother had sobbed uncontrollably when she\u2019d been told that Mark was dead. Mark had lingered in the hospital all night, giving them hope he\u2019d survive, but in the end, he hadn\u2019t. Michael\u2019s mother must be living through that same hell of hope.</p><p>Kim nodded. Find Michael. That was top priority.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d the feral Shifter said. \u201cGo with it.\u201d</p><p>Liam gritted his teeth against profound pain. \u201cEasy for who? Who the hell are you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was called Justin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What are you called now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman names have no meaning for us anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the gods\u2019 sake.\u201d Liam lay flat on his back on the cement floor, his limbs on fire. He felt the beast in him snarling and raging, but his body hurt so much it could snarl and rage all it wanted to. Lying still was a good thing.</p><p>Heat pressed on the warehouse, and Liam felt the tingle of an approaching storm. He sensed clouds building, the electricity that fused the air miles away.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the boy?\u201d Liam asked</p><p>\u201cStill here.\u201d The Lupine smiled. \u201cI\u2019m saving him for you, like I was told.\u201d</p><p>Liam then sensed Michael in the alley outside. The Lupine must have chased after him and tethered him. Liam tasted the boy\u2019s fear on the wind, arousing both Liam\u2019s protective nature and his innate instinct that the male offspring of another male had to be eliminated. The two feelings warred in him, escalating his confusion.</p><p>\u201cAnd why haven\u2019t you rid yourself of me as I lay here helpless?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cI know my place in the hierarchy. You will lead us to greatness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost it, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the leader. I smell it on you. You defeated the only one greater than you, and now no Shifter can best you. I\u2019m weak, but you will make me strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShite.\u201d Liam\u2019s neck felt like fire and at the same time, strangely light. Justin peeling away Liam\u2019s Collar had been the worst agony Liam had ever felt in his life. He\u2019d screamed as the metal had unfused from his skin, his mind clouding with nothing but pain. When the fog cleared he\u2019d found himself flat on his back, unable to move.</p><p>\u201cThe pain will go away,\u201d Justin said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll be free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters are strong, my master. Stronger than any human will ever be. Why should we be slaves to them? When they put Collars on us, they only made us stronger.\u201d</p><p>Liam felt weak as a flea. \u201cHow did you figure that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel it, don\u2019t you? The instincts you suppressed for so long, the strength you lost when the Collar was put on you. I bet at first you didn\u2019t have the strength to make it through a day without vomiting. We\u2019ve learned how to live even with the oppression of the Collars. So when they come off, the instincts pour back, your strength comes back\u2014twenty years worth of it in one go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>Liam knew Justin was right, as crazy as the man sounded. His strength was slowly returning to his limbs, whatever drug he\u2019d been given starting to wear off. Liam\u2019s sense of smell and hearing seemed sharper than ever, and the growing storm pounded at his brain.</p><p>The heightened scent ability was a little unfortunate, since Justin hadn\u2019t bathed in a long, long time. Justin didn\u2019t seem to mind, but then ferals had different ideas about cleanliness. To hell with that. Even if Liam were now feral, he was still taking showers.</p><p>Liam worked to mask his raw fear, and raw fear covered the killing instinct rising inside him. All his protectiveness was quickly ebbing. Michael was not his offspring. He should kill the cub while he could. Liam fought the urge with difficulty.</p> <p>I am so screwed.</p><p>Liam thought of Kim, how terrified she\u2019d be if she could know the thoughts that whirled through his brain.</p><p>Mate. Mine.</p><p>Liam wanted her\u2014on her back, on her hands and knees, he didn\u2019t care. He wanted her here so he could bury himself inside her. Over and over again until she and her sassy mouth knew who had mastered her.</p><p>No, I\u2019d never hurt her.</p> <p>Kim would give him children, his brain ground on remorselessly. As many as Liam wanted. Birth control be damned. He\u2019d find some way to counteract it and never allow her to take it again. He\u2019d lock her in the attic room of his house until she obeyed. It was big up there\u2014Connor could take Liam\u2019s room. And Liam would move into the master suite after he killed Dylan.</p><p>Oh, father god, help me.</p><p>Dylan should die. He was defeated, Liam now leader of the pride. Justin had known that without being told. Dylan should be driven out where he\u2019d face death alone\u2014or he could be given the dignity of letting Liam break his neck.</p><p>Glory would mourn him. But Glory was a be-damned Lupine, and who cared how much she howled? If she loved Dylan so much, she could join him.</p><p>Liam rolled over and pressed his face to the floor. This isn\u2019t me. These aren\u2019t my thoughts.</p><p>It\u2019s inside you. It\u2019s what\u2019s right. Give in to it.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Justin laughed. \u201cI went through that too. It\u2019s much more fun to go with it.\u201d</p><p>Liam hated Justin\u2019s laugh. He hated the male for doing this to him. Liam\u2019s Collar lay on the floor about ten feet away. It was nothing but a piece of silver and black chain with a Celtic knot on it, a harmless bit of metal. Without it, Liam was free.</p><p>Liam climbed to his feet. Pain still gripped him, but it was starting to recede. He fixed his gaze on Justin.</p><p>Justin grinned. \u201cYou see? You\u2019re getting stronger. I\u2019ll show you how the Collars work, and we can go back to Shiftertown and start freeing Shifters. You\u2019re stronger than this Fergus, now. I can feel it. It won\u2019t take you long to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Liam growled. Justin backed up some more and let out a growl of his own.</p><p>Weak, mewling bastard who\u2019s made me want to kill my own father and make a slave ofmy mate.</p><p>Justin growled again, this one defensive. A growl of fear.</p> <p>Wherever he\u2019d come from, Justin must have been fairly far down in his hierarchy. He smelled wrong, weak, evil.</p><p>Liam followed Justin\u2019s advice and let the feral beast come. All the thoughts that had been spinning in his head focused into one specific thought, and Justin was its target.</p><p>Liam leapt, and Justin started to scream.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Sean took Kim to the east side of Shiftertown, speaking little but tight with tension. Dylan remained behind, saying it was his job to keep coordinating the search.</p><p>\u201cThese streets are a maze,\u201d Kim said anxiously as they turned down yet another block.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t search as well in a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>The roads were narrow and potholed, and blind alleys ran behind buildings like a maze without end. This part of Austin had been more or less abandoned when the Shifters moved in nearby. Kim had been a kid at the time, but she remembered her father saying that thriving businesses had moved out of the area and left it to Shifters and the homeless.</p><p>Not many homeless were around, which was odd. It was true that in the summer, vagrants left southern cities, like migrating birds, to find the cooler climes of the north. Even so, many stayed, panhandling from prosperous businessmen and politicians in downtown Austin. None lingered out here. Was that because they thought the pickings wouldn\u2019t be good or because they feared Shifters?</p><p>Whatever menace they felt, Kim picked it up as well. The humid air bristled with electricity, a prelude to a storm. She glanced at the horizon and saw that dark clouds were indeed building, thunderheads ominous. Austin didn\u2019t get many tornadoes, but some came through on occasion, and those clouds looked ready to play. All the more reason they needed to find Liam and Michael.</p><p>\u201cI hope we find Michael before Nate and Spike do,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI know they\u2019re helping, but I don\u2019t trust them. And I can\u2019t believe his name is Spike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a Buffy fan.\u201d</p><p>Kim had a surreal vision of Tattoo Guy eating pop-corn and cheering on Buffy and her pals, and wanted to laugh in nervous hysteria.</p><p>Sean, Shifter-fashion, would not let Kim walk ahead of him. He turned down yet another alley, shadows gathering in it from the storm and the coming night, and stopped so abruptly that Kim ran into his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cCall Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind telling me why?\u201d Kim pulled out her cell phone as she tried to peer around him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found Michael.\u201d Sean walked slowly into the alley.</p><p>Kim\u2019s phone read \u201cno service.\u201d Damn wireless providers. Perfect when you were in the middle of a teeming city where there were plenty of other ways to communicate, useless out where you needed them the most.</p><p>She could walk back down the long alleys behind the crumbling buildings until she found a good spot. Alone. Without Sean and his mean sword to protect her.</p><p>Kim ducked into the alley behind Sean. If they\u2019d found Michael, they could grab him and hightail it out of here.</p><p>Sean slipped his sword out of its sheath without breaking stride. Oh, no. Please, no.</p><p>Kim raced after him, her sandals pattering on the broken asphalt. She reached the small body stretched out on the pavement the same time Sean did and went down on her knees beside him.</p><p>\u201cMichael.\u201d Kim lifted him, breathing a sigh of relief to find him warm, his small heart beating. \u201cOh, thank God.\u201d</p><p>Michael whimpered, and Kim held him close. The boy\u2019s eyes were tightly closed, as though he\u2019d withdrawn far into himself. Kim cradled him, rocked him, pressed her cheek to his hair. One of his hands was manacled, the chain stretching to a ring in the brick wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right, sweetheart,\u201d she said. \u201cI have you. Sean, can you get the chain off him?\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t sheathe the sword. \u201cSomething\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s nostrils flared, and his eyes went white. Gripping his sword, he kicked the rest of the rotten boards free from the open doorway and ducked into the shadows of the building. A second later, Kim heard him exclaim violently.</p><p>Kim stood up. Michael clung to her, whispering, \u201cThe bad man. The bad man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bad man, Michael?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. The tether let her carry him just inside the shaded doorway. A wide warehouse floor opened out in front of her, an empty room a couple of stories high. Texas dust coated the floor and hung in the air.</p><p>Sean stood over a body sprawled in the middle of the floor. The man was large and naked, with shreds of clothes around him. Kim couldn\u2019t see his face, and fear stabbed through her.</p><p>\u201cLiam?\u201d she asked, heart in her throat. Please, please, no.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him before. But he\u2019s Shifter, and he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Sean solemnly raised the sword, point down, the hilt between both hands. He whispered words Kim couldn\u2019t catch as he brought the blade down into the Shifter\u2019s chest. Air around the fallen man seemed to shimmer. Then, as had the Shifter who\u2019d attacked Kim in her bedroom, its body crumbled to dust.</p><p>\u201cHe was feral.\u201d Liam\u2019s rich voice rolled out of the shadows. Sean straightened and turned, and Liam himself walked toward them from the back of the warehouse. Kim went slack with relief. \u201cHe told me Fergus and Brian were experimenting on him,\u201d Liam went on. \u201cThey found a way to remove his Collar. That\u2019s what Brian was doing the night his girlfriend was killed, and that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t tell anyone where he\u2019d really been.\u201d</p><p>Kim put Michael down on the cool pavement, smoothed his hair, and reassured him she\u2019d be right back. The boy lay down and curled into a ball, and Kim hurried inside. \u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>Sean put a large hand on Kim\u2019s shoulder and yanked her back. Kim collided with Sean\u2019s chest, and his hard hand kept her pinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Let go of me.\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t release her. Liam kept walking toward them. He was shirtless, and angry scratches bled across his chest. But he didn\u2019t move as if he was hurt; he walked slowly, like a lion stalking its prey, every step deliberate, focused.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her,\u201d Liam said clearly to Sean.</p><p>Kim tried to start forward again, but Sean\u2019s iron grip held her back. \u201cNo,\u201d he said in her ear.</p><p>Liam stopped. \u201cI said, get your f**king hands off her.\u201d</p><p>Kim went ice-cold. Sean let go of Kim\u2019s shoulder, but he didn\u2019t step away. \u201cLet her take Michael home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter idea. You run like hell and leave Kim and the boy to me.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s heart pounded. \u201cLiam, what is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Liam walked into the light. His eyes were fixed, glittering, wrong. Around his throat was an angry red line where his Collar had been.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s feral,\u201d Sean said grimly.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s heart pounded. No wonder Fergus wanted Brian dead; no wonder he\u2019d told Brian to plead guilty and face the consequences. Fergus couldn\u2019t risk that Brian wouldn\u2019t tell a courtroom about their experiments on the Collars. Shit.</p><p>The Liam who stood before them was nothing like the Liam Kim knew. His warm smile, his loving blue eyes, the compassion that usually radiated from him\u2014all had been wiped away. This man had hatred in his eyes, primal rage, the need to kill. He\u2019d killed the feral in there and left Michael chained.</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The Lupine who\u2019d invaded Kim\u2019s bedroom had terrified her. Having Liam\u2019s white-blue gaze trained on her now was ten times scarier. No other Shifter was powerful enough to stop him, and Liam knew it.</p><p>\u201cRun away, Sean Morrissey,\u201d he said. \u201cOr I\u2019ll kill you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to stay. I\u2019m the Guardian.\u201d Sean went on in a low voice, \u201cI already sent one of my brother\u2019s souls to eternity, Liam. Please, please don\u2019t make me have to do it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stood back and let him die.\u201d</p><p>Kim gasped. \u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>Sean flushed. \u201cHow the hell would you know, Liam? You weren\u2019t even there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you, Sean.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s rage crackled, and the storm outside answered with a rumble. \u201cFuck you, Liam. Kenny died while you played good little deputy to a man you loathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Fergus will pay for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Kim put herself between the two Shifters\u2014not a reassuring place to be. \u201cI know you\u2019re not thinking clearly right now, Liam, but fighting Sean isn\u2019t going to help. Kenny died, and I\u2019m sorry, but you two killing each other won\u2019t bring him back. Do you think that\u2019s what he would have wanted, you remembering him by blaming each other?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s gaze swiveled to her. Being pinned with that stare had to be one of most frightening things that had ever happened to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d had sex with this man, watched him while he slept, held him when he hurt. Somewhere inside that walking menace was the Liam who mourned his dead brother, who teased Kim and worried about the missing Michael, who grieved that he\u2019d hurt his father.</p><p>Please don\u2019t let that all be a sham. Please let that man still be in there.</p><p>Please let me reach him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me,\u201d she said to him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>Liam didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t betray any emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s not love. You\u2019re my mate. We have the mate bond.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m not a Shifter, thank you very much. I have emotions, not instincts, not mate-bonds. If I say I love you, that\u2019s what I mean. At least, I love Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotions are instincts. You dress them up and write songs about them, but that\u2019s what they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, way to romance a girl. I liked you better with the Collar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did. Because you could control me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike anyone could ever control you, Liam Morrissey. The man who does whatever he pleases, Collar be damned.\u201d</p><p>Sean leaned down to her. \u201cDo me a favor and run like hell instead of provoking him.\u201d</p><p>Liam roared. \u201cI said, don\u2019t touch her!\u201d</p><p>Michael started crying. Sean backed off. Kim headed for Michael, and found Liam blocking her way. She hadn\u2019t seen him move, but suddenly there he was, right in front of her.</p><p>\u201cMichael\u2019s hurt and scared,\u201d Kim said to him. Right there with you, kid. \u201cLet me take him home. His mother is worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, get the boy out of here. Before I give in to my instincts and kill him, and you.\u201d</p> <p>Kim folded her arms, trying a glare. \u201cWhat, you mean you haven\u2019t given in to your instincts already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sean, do it.\u201d</p><p>Kim sent Sean a shaky look. \u201cI agree with him. Please get Michael out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leave you here with him? Are you insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam is right about the mate-bond thing,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d Sean asked. \u201cNot very convincing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop arguing. Michael has a mother worried sick about him, and he needs to go home. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She glanced at Liam. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim, I\u2019ve never seen him like this. He wasn\u2019t like this before we took the Collar. This is\u2014something else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe instincts are enhanced,\u201d said a new voice.</p><p>Fergus pushed himself from the wide door frame where he\u2019d been leaning and strolled inside. His own Collar was still intact, thank goodness, but he moved confidently, as though he knew he\u2019d done something clever.</p><p>\u201cSee, this is why you shouldn\u2019t argue,\u201d Kim said to Sean. \u201cYou lose your window of opportunity to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the woman who never shuts up,\u201d Fergus said.</p><p>Kim turned what she hoped was a fearless gaze on Fergus. \u201cJust what I need. Another ass**le to make my day complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mate has a mouth,\u201d Fergus said to Liam. \u201cYou need to teach her manners. If you don\u2019t, I will.\u201d</p><p>Liam pivoted to face Fergus, his boot heel turning on the gritty cement floor. Fergus stopped, his body coming alert.</p><p>\u201cThen again,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI might enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>The world had gone to hell. The smell of death clogged Liam\u2019s nostrils, despite Sean already sending the feral\u2019s body to dust. He smelled fear as well. Watery terror from the cub. Fear from his own brother. Fear from Kim, his lover, his pride mate.</p><p>Fergus\u2019s fear was the strongest of all.</p><p>The whole place stank of terror, enough to gag him. If Liam killed all of them, except Kim, he could get rid of the smell.</p><p>A little corner of his brain tapped him. What the hell is the matter with you? Sean was right\u2014it hadn\u2019t been like this before the Collar. They\u2019d lived freely, hunting when they wanted to, going hungry when there was no food to be had. They\u2019d huddled together\u2014three brothers, father, and mother\u2014warming one another, playing together in the good times, sticking together in the bad. Loving each other.</p><p>Now Liam hated every Shifter in this room, Fergus especially. He didn\u2019t hate Kim, but she drove him the most crazy. He wanted to get her away from the others, to keep her safe. They wanted her\u2014Shifters needed mates, and Sean had never claimed a mate. Sean was a danger.</p><p>The cub was a tiny thing, no threat, but it was the offspring of another Shifter. Kill it, Liam\u2019s senses whispered.</p><p>Fergus wanted Liam to kill the cub, then kill Sean. Liam knew it, and he didn\u2019t know how he knew it.</p><p>Fergus wanted power, Fergus wanted Kim, and most of all, he was afraid of Liam.</p><p>Ergo, Fergus should die first.</p><p>\u201cThe Collars were programmed to suppress everything that makes us who we are,\u201d Fergus was saying. \u201cThe Fae who made them hated Shifters. And understood them. Removing the Collars will remove that suppression and make us powerful. Unstoppable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd crazy as hell,\u201d Kim said. \u201cLook at him.\u201d</p><p>Fergus couldn\u2019t look at Liam. His gaze slid sideways, back to Kim. \u201cHe senses his mate. He wants to f**k.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWipe that disgusting look off your face,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI don\u2019t even want you thinking about us like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, human. You\u2019ll be his slave, and that\u2019s all you\u2019ll be. He\u2019ll screw you until you die pushing out his cubs, and then he\u2019ll find another female to give him more. It\u2019s what we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your mates would be happy to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mates know their place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIs this how you plan to take over the world? Repulsive imagery and insults?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re far stronger than humans. Without the Collars, we\u2019ll quickly suppress those who suppressed us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your plan is so terrific, why is your Collar still on?\u201d Kim asked him.</p><p>Fergus gave her a deprecating look. \u201cThe leader of the clan couldn\u2019t be risked. We first needed to know that removing the Collars wouldn\u2019t simply kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many did it kill?\u201d Sean asked. The storm outside was building, the pressing humidity cut by an icy breeze.</p><p>\u201cOne or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it make one victim so crazy he went out and killed a Shifter woman and her cubs?\u201d Sean went on.</p><p>Fergus\u2019s eyes flicked sideways. \u201cThere were complications. You took care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Kim put in. \u201cAfter he attacked me in my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have if you hadn\u2019t smeared your scent all over Liam,\u201d Fergus said in disgust. \u201cIt smelled a rival\u2019s mate.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why the thing was so fast and so good at tracking, Liam thought. It was a Collared Shifter, made crazy by having its Collar ripped off.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that feral,\u201d Sean was saying. \u201cOr this one. Where did they come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Orleans. I offered them something better than hiding out in the bayous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat offer,\u201d Kim said. \u201c \u2018Come to Austin. First we\u2019ll make you insane, then we\u2019ll kill you.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sean said, voice tight with fury. \u201cHe no doubt offered them mates, their pick. Maybe the chance to move up in the hierarchy. My guess is they were low in their packs in the first place. And they were Lupines. If something went wrong\u2014death or madness\u2014they were only bloody Lupines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered them freedom,\u201d Fergus growled.</p><p>\u201cFree to be hunted like you were in the past?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>Fergus\u2019s face darkened. \u201cFree as we were before humans rounded us up like animals. We had the run of the land. We feared no one. Humans took that away from us. All I\u2019m doing is taking it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were hungry,\u201d Sean said, his voice quiet. \u201cRemember? Winters with no food, watching family die, watching cubs not make it until spring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if we had humans feeding us, being our slaves, not the other way around, that wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDream on,\u201d Kim broke in. \u201cShifters are strong and hard to kill, but not impossible. I\u2019m sure machine guns would do the trick. Is that what you want to see happen? Your pride mates mowed down by a SWAT team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen if you\u2019re the slaves, you stupid woman. Liam, you might want to consider a different mate. Or at least use her up quick and get rid of her. I knew she was a pain in the ass the minute I laid eyes on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou touch Kim, you die,\u201d Liam said clearly.</p><p>Everyone stopped talking. Liam walked toward Fergus, his boots loud on the stone floor. Fergus wanted to run\u2014Liam saw that in the man\u2019s eyes, his stance, every inch of his body.</p><p>Liam wouldn\u2019t let him run. Fergus was his inferior; he had to obey Liam, and Fergus knew it, no matter how much he blustered. The instincts Fergus boasted about would force him to acknowledge his own weakness.</p><p>Kim had a power that Shifters lacked: the power to see all sides of a situation clearly, no matter how scared she was or how angry. She could argue with conviction, she could find a flaw in the other person\u2019s obsession and tap it until he opened his mind and saw what she saw.</p><p>Fergus would never see anything clearly. But Liam did. At least, Liam had before Justin had ripped off his Collar and made his brain scramble.</p><p>Liam\u2019s emotion and instinct warred with his reason, and none of them won. The wind outside grew colder, a bad storm for certain. Liam smelled the icy hail in the clouds, electricity that would fork down on the city at any moment.</p><p>One thought stood out from the others: Fergus had to be stopped. If Liam let Fergus go today, he would continue to push to \u201cfree\u201d the Shifters, continue his awful experiments, making his victims crazed and violent while he honed the process. Fergus couldn\u2019t control his ferals yet, and, Fergus-like, he was trying to make other people clean up his mess. For him, the end always justified the means.</p><p>\u201cKim is right,\u201d Liam said, surprised his voice was so calm. \u201cYou are an ass**le. You\u2019ll set Shifter against Shifter. We\u2019ll kill each other long before the humans even know there\u2019s trouble. We\u2019ll each want our families to survive, and ours alone. Our gene pool, our pride. The Shiftertowns, the living with other species\u2014you\u2019re right, that\u2019s artificial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly my point,\u201d Fergus said. \u201cWe get Sean\u2019s Collar off him, we get the Guardian\u2014who can stop us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Liam came to a halt in front of Fergus.</p><p>He saw Fergus\u2019s pupils change to slits, his nostrils widen, his body emanate fear. He was not far shy of wetting himself. He tried to cover it by puffing out his chest with false bravado. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch me. I\u2019m your clan leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are weak.\u201d Liam\u2019s voice was completely flat.</p><p>\u201cI outrank you,\u201d Fergus said abruptly. \u201cIt\u2019s me first, then Dylan, then you. You can\u2019t beat me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam fought Dylan and won,\u201d Kim said. \u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean stared.</p><p>Fergus\u2019s face whitened until it was almost green. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, girl. No one can best Dylan. Only me.\u201d</p><p>Kim went on. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out of the loop. Liam defeated his dad. Liam isn\u2019t happy about it, but he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Sean whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Fergus tried. \u201cI am still clan leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are nothing.\u201d Liam sounded strange, even to himself. \u201cI have no ties to anyone outside my family. Michael would be easiest to kill. But I think it\u2019s more important to kill you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCrap.\u201d Sean braved Liam\u2019s wrath to grab Kim and pull her well out of the way of Liam and Fergus.</p><p>Liam fought the urge to take Kim back and rake his claws across Sean\u2019s face. He forced himself to let Sean go; Sean was protecting Liam\u2019s mate from the enemy. Fergus would use Kim to distract Liam, and Sean was right to get her out of the way. Liam\u2019s bloodlust still wanted him to throw Sean down for touching her, the need burning through him.</p><p>Deep down, his love for Sean, his brother, boiled up, wanting his attention. It showed him visions of himself and Sean and Kenny, playing together as cubs, wrestling until they fell asleep in a pile in exhaustion. When they were older, talking about the world and speculating on females and what it would be like to be with one. Celebrating when Kenny took a mate, and again when Sinead became pregnant. Sean and Liam holding each other the day Kenny had died, weeping profusely.</p><p>Memories of love, frustration, joy, and family were being erased by the adrenaline, the need to fight. Fergus wanted to do this to all Shifters everywhere. He\u2019d destroy them.</p> <p>Liam fixed on Fergus again. He toed off his boots and peeled away his T-shirt. Fergus watched with a sneer, then smiled and began yanking off his own clothes.</p><p>Fergus attacked while Liam was still shifting. Liam rolled out of the way, his limbs crackling and stretching, muscles moving into new positions. Fergus leapt again, and this time, Liam spun out of reach and came to his feet as his wild Fae-cat.</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t stop his roar. It came from deep within, the beast finally free. It proclaimed that this place was his, not only the warehouse or Shiftertown, but everything for miles: the city, Hill Country, as far as Liam could roam. He was clan leader, and Fergus was nothing. As it should be.</p><p>The roar shook the building. Beams shifted, and loose bricks and plaster rained to the floor. Michael started screaming, his screams becoming yowls as he shifted into Feline form. Sean dragged Kim outside, straight into a pouring rain.</p><p>Liam closed his mouth, shook out his body, and leapt on the terrified Fergus.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>\u201cCan you get him free?\u201d Kim yelled at Sean, over the frenzy of violence inside the warehouse.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019ll hold still.\u201d Sean grabbed the chain that had been linked to the wall. Michael continued to snarl and thrash, the manacle cutting into his paw.</p><p>\u201cMichael.\u201d Kim knelt next to him and reached for him but got scratched for her pains. \u201cMichael, sweetie. It\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Michael knew damn well it wasn\u2019t all right. Inside, two enormous wildcats fought for dominance, and they wouldn\u2019t stop until one was dead. Their snarls sounded over the thunder that boomed through the alley. The building heaved when the two battling Shifters smashed into a wall.</p><p>If Fergus wins, he\u2019ll kill the rest of us. Or maybe Fergus would keep Kim alive to be his sex toy, which was not something she wanted to think about. Still less did she want to think about Liam losing, dying, Sean having to send him to dust.</p> <p>Sean yanked the chain, hook and all, from the wall. Michael yowled, then took off down the alley, the chain dragging behind him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll run home,\u201d Sean said. \u201cYou go too, Kim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim, damn it, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go? Round up Dylan and everybody to come and stop Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Liam like that? Too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019d be safe. Fergus won\u2019t let you live, and Liam keeps thinking you want me for yourself for some reason. He might kill you in his frenzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and you\u2019ll be safe from him, will you? I\u2019m staying, Kim. I\u2019m the Guardian.\u201d</p> <p>He meant he\u2019d have to dispatch the loser with his magic sword, sending his soul into the next world. From Sean\u2019s grim look, he feared it would be Liam.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m staying too,\u201d Kim said. Inside, the two Shifters fought like crazy, foam and blood flying. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine then. We\u2019ll die together.\u201d</p><p>Sean marched back into the warehouse. The rain changed to a pelting of pea-sized hail, bouncing on the alley floor.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Kim muttered.</p><p>The hail came down so fast it piled on the pavement before it could melt. Kim ducked into the shelter of the building, afraid and angry.</p><p>The two Shifters rolled over and over, and Sean stood back like a referee, his sword ready. Weeks ago, Kim wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell the fighting wildcats apart, but she knew Liam now. He and Fergus were matched in size, but Liam\u2019s cat was thicker with muscle, his coat darker, his eyes a deeper gold. Right now his eyes glittered with hatred, and his teeth were fully extended as he snapped them at Fergus\u2019s neck.</p><p>Fergus scrambled out of the way, half shifting back to human to do so. Liam followed him, pinning him again. The wildcats clawed and bit. This was worse than the fight between Liam and Dylan, because there\u2019d never been love lost between these two. Rage and hatred burned in the thickly humid air.</p><p>Thunder boomed outside, and then a bolt of lightning struck the roof. Kim screamed as bricks came down around her.</p><p>She saw Liam turn to her, drawn from the fight. In that moment, Fergus, his hide nothing but bloody strips of skin, pounced on Liam\u2019s back. His mouth was open wide, jaws ready to snap Liam\u2019s spine in two.</p><p>Sean shouted. Kim couldn\u2019t hear him over the thunder; she just saw his mouth open. Liam whirled in time, closing his teeth on Fergus\u2019s throat. He ripped, and blood sprayed across the floor.</p><p>Fergus went down in a heap. Liam stepped back, his fur red with Fergus\u2019s blood, and roared his victory. His eyes held fire, joy, and triumph.</p><p>Sean walked forward with his sword. Liam stopped him, rising into his human form as he moved, his body covered in scratches and angry bruises. He went to Fergus and nudged him with his foot. The wildcat\u2019s body flopped against the floor, blood spilling from a pool beneath it.</p><p>Liam turned away, contempt for his fallen enemy in every movement. As soon as his back was turned, Fergus whipped to his feet, bellowing in dying rage as he launched himself at Liam. Kim shrieked.</p><p>But Sean was there. He stepped between Fergus and his brother, and caught Fergus\u2019s leap on the Guardian\u2019s sword.</p><p>Fergus\u2019s wildcat eyes widened as the sword went through his chest. He\u2019d been dying already, and the blade completed it. The body fell to the ground, silent and still. Chanting in a language Kim didn\u2019t know, Sean slowly withdrew the blade. The big cat shimmered, then crumbled to dust.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to do that,\u201d Liam snarled at Sean. \u201cHis final breath should have been mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019ve done it.\u201d Sean\u2019s stance was defiant. He\u2019d have done anything, the tiny rational part of Liam realized, to keep from having to send a second brother to the Summerland.</p><p>Again his love for Sean and the wildcat\u2019s jealousy warred within him. \u201cGo,\u201d Liam said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I might kill you, and I don\u2019t want to lose you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Liam\u2019s white-hot rage rose. \u201cKim stays with me.\u201d</p><p>Sean strode for the door, moving fast. \u201cKim,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was quiet, a cool note amid the heat. Sean gave Kim one last look, then made himself sheathe the sword and duck out into the deluge.</p><p>Liam was across the floor, pulling Kim against him before Sean\u2019s footsteps faded.</p><p>\u201cKim.\u201d He loved saying her name.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t care.\u201d Liam pressed Kim against the brick wall.</p><p>He wanted her with an intensity he\u2019d never felt before. She was his mate, his, forever. A dim part of Liam\u2019s mind kicked him. You love her. Don\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>\u201cYou should get away from me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Liam focused on her eyes. They were beautiful, wide and blue. Like an Irish lake, he\u2019d thought once. He hadn\u2019t changed his mind.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Kim touched his face. He flinched, then made himself accept her touch. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s frigging hailing out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go slow. I can\u2019t be nice.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and laced her arms around his neck. She was shaking, but her eyes were soft. \u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d She kissed the tip of his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go slow. I need you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. The bricks scraped his arms as he shielded her from the wall. She wrapped her legs around his hips, her skirt riding up her thighs. It was easy to shove aside the elastic of her thong, to find her opening with his cock. She sucked in a breath, eyes widening, as he slid firmly into her.</p><p>How could he have ever thought that sex in human form was boring? He was content never to do it as a wildcat again. Kim was hot and wet, so easy to enter. She arched against him, her ni**les rubbing him through her thin shirt. Liam shielded her from the wall with his arms, the bricks abrading his already bloody skin.</p><p>His adrenaline hadn\u2019t cooled from the fight. He needed this mating. Liam\u2019s heart rocketed, his blood hot.</p><p>Kim\u2019s sheath clenched him, her body and his fitting together perfectly. His mind went blank. All he felt was Kim, all he smelled was her body and her sex, her breath, her hair. He licked her face. He tasted her neck. He thrust into her, his blood pumping. Outside, lightning crackled, blinding flashes followed by booms of thunder. The hail fell like bullets on the roof, balls of ice bouncing in through the wide door.</p><p>\u201cLiam. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Liam squeezed his eyes shut and leaned his forehead on the wall. He shoved himself into her as though he wanted to crawl inside her and be part of her. His shoulders bunched; his breath burned in his lungs.</p><p>Kim shuddered in climax, her feet around his bu**ocks. The heels of her sandals grated his skin, and he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Still holding her with one arm between her and the wall, Liam pounded his fist into the brick. Another lightning strike lit the world, and Liam came.</p><p>Sweat poured from him, his body on fire. Kim was screaming, and Liam heard his own voice ring through the warehouse. He was falling. Kim, he had to catch her.</p><p>He landed flat on his back, Kim\u2019s soft body on top of his. The movement slid him out of her hot sheath, and he groaned with loss.</p><p>Kim smiled down at him. \u201cHoly shit. That was...good.\u201d</p><p>Liam wanted to answer her, tell her it was the best he\u2019d ever had, that he loved her. He could only gasp for breath. The pain of his fight, the bewilderment of his flooding instincts, robbed him of his voice.</p><p>Kim closed her hand on him, and he groaned again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still hard. I thought you came.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cI did.\u201d Gritting his teeth, he turned her over to put her beneath him and entered her once more.</p><p>Sex had never been like this before. Not free-for-all, no-holding-back, wet and messy sex. Kim laughed with it.</p><p>Not to mention having it on a bare cement floor with a naked, half-crazed, hard-bodied Shifter on top of her while a hailstorm raged outside. Another lightning bolt could strike the building and bring it down on top of them, and Kim didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Liam,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>He opened his eyes. Once beautiful blue, they were now Shifter gray-white.</p><p>Kim would be afraid later. Right now, she was as crazed as he was. Was this what he meant by mating frenzy?</p><p>Liam pumped into her for a few more minutes, then dragged in a breath and filled her with his hot seed. Liam collapsed on top of her, breathing hard, his body roasting. He lingered on her, kissing her face and hair, then rolled off onto his back, still breathing as though he\u2019d just finished a ten-mile run.</p><p>They lay still for a long time, Liam\u2019s breathing hoarse, Kim too tired to move. Gradually the hailstorm slackened, the time between lightning strikes increasing. Thunder rumbled in the distance, the storm drifting away, following the river. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Liam didn\u2019t move, and Kim wondered if he\u2019d dropped off to sleep. She propped her aching body on one arm. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Liam lay face up, eyes open, his breathing rapid. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe storm\u2019s letting up. It\u2019s what my mother liked to call a \u2018wham-bam, thank you, ma\u2019am\u2019 storm.\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t answer, didn\u2019t laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what the storm dying off means,\u201d Kim continued. \u201cIt means that Sean and your dad are going to come looking for us. I bet Connor and Glory will too. And Ellison. He was real worried about you when I saw him earlier. In fact, every Shifter curious about what happened to you will be showing up pretty quick.\u201d</p><p>Liam raked his sweating hair from his face. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s going to stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim.\u201d Liam\u2019s face twisted, and he wrapped his arms around his chest. \u201cI need to find my Collar before they get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you really want?\u201d she asked in a quiet voice.</p> <p>\u201cFergus was crazy. He\u2019d have destroyed us.\u201d</p><p>Kim noticed he hadn\u2019t answered the question. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Shifters can adapt to going without the Collar again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this.\u201d Liam\u2019s chest expanded with an agonized breath. \u201cWe\u2019ll kill each other. Gods, Kim, I wanted to kill Michael. I needed to. Even Sean. My own brother. And the feelings haven\u2019t gone away. If they come to get us, I\u2019ll fight. I\u2019ll kill until someone kills me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me?\u201d</p><p>He reached for her. \u201cNo. You, I just want to f**k.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be flattered, but I have the feeling I wouldn\u2019t last very long. You have stamina.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d hurt you. I\u2019ve already hurt you.\u201d He touched her bruised lip.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t you get it, Liam? You could have, but you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no guarantee, love. I want you so damn bad.\u201d He kissed her swollen lips and drew back, eyes flicking from white to blue to white again.</p><p>Kim touched the red line on his neck. Liam flinched but didn\u2019t stop her.</p><p>\u201cOr you could go,\u201d she said softly. \u201cRun away back to Ireland or something. Live free.\u201d</p><p>Liam closed his eyes, blotting out the awful look in them. \u201cNot without you. I don\u2019t want to live without you.\u201d He bowed his head, resting on Kim\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut Fergus was right. I\u2019d use you until there was nothing left of you. I\u2019d not be able to stop myself.\u201d He raised his head, expression anguished. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? If I\u2019m this way, I can\u2019t have you.\u201d</p><p>Kim rubbed his arms, wishing she could tell him that everything would be all right. You\u2019ll be fine, you\u2019ll get used to it, you\u2019ll learn to control your instincts. But she had no idea whether it would be all right. The Lupine who\u2019d attacked her in her bedroom had been the victim of Fergus\u2019s experiments, ready to slaughter Kim to torture Liam. She\u2019d seen the way Liam had looked at innocent Michael and at his own brother, as though they were enemies he needed to destroy. She had no idea what kind of crazed being Liam would become.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you to put yourself into captivity again for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate the Collar. Kim, I hate it so much. It hurts us when we so much as think about the way we used to be. One surge of adrenaline and it\u2019s giving us pain. You can\u2019t know what that\u2019s like. Always living in fear of the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing free of it...\u201d Liam slid his fingers and thumb around the mark where the Collar had been, his wild smile emerging. \u201cIt\u2019s a joyous thing, love. I can do anything I want, and no one can stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s the trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean said you weren\u2019t like this before\u2014before you all took the Collar, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this out of control. Not with twenty years of need falling on me at once. But it was like this too. We were strong and free, and those few who knew about us were in awe of us. Even the Fae acknowledged our strength, that we no longer served their whims. That\u2019s what rankles most\u2014the Fae helped to bind us. They\u2019ve always wanted to bind us.\u201d Anger danced in his eyes, lines pulling the sides of his mouth. \u201cWe hate them for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about humans?\u201d Kim made herself ask.</p><p>\u201cHuman beings are weak, short-lived. No threat.\u201d Liam\u2019s eyes eased back to the blue she\u2019d fallen in love with. \u201cThe one I\u2019m lying on now is so beautiful. And I love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you escape, Liam. I want you to be free. Don\u2019t find the Collar. Please.\u201d</p><p>Liam closed his eyes again, tight. He shuddered, lips shaking, as though wave after wave of panic ripped through him.</p><p>After a long time, he opened his eyes again, and something in them had been defeated. \u201cNo, love. They need me here. And I never, ever want to wake up in the morning knowing that I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Kim touched his face. The anguish in his voice a moment ago when he\u2019d said he hated the Collar had been real. He hadn\u2019t mentioned his loathing before this, but Shifters were strong and could resign themselves to pain, and he\u2019d probably seen no use in voicing his rage to Kim. Having the Collar off, feeling the pain evaporate for the first time in twenty years, must be incredible for him. She wasn\u2019t sure how he could even contemplate putting it back on.</p><p>\u201cNo one would blame you if you went,\u201d she said. \u201cDylan would take over again, like before, and Sean would still be Guardian. They\u2019ll look after Connor and everyone else. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d blame me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut free, you could start working on how to liberate the rest of your kind.\u201d</p><p>Liam kissed her forehead. \u201cNo, love. Free I\u2019d be thinking of only myself and how good it felt to be away from all this. I\u2019d start despising them for being weak, find myself a pride of ferals and try to take over. A wonderful Shifter-man I\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that. Like you said, all these urges are built up. Maybe in time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe not.\u201d His voice went hard, and he rolled off Kim and to his feet. \u201cWe find the Collar.\u201d</p><p>Kim remained on the floor, staring up at his hard body. He was beautiful\u2014firm muscle, broad shoulders, chest dusted with dark hair, now damp with sweat. His skin was covered with scratches from the fight, but they were healing, even the deepest ones only angry red lines. The worst wound was around his neck, where his Collar had been.</p><p>As he forced himself to turn from Kim to look for the Collar, Kim knew that Fergus had never understood just how strong Liam was. He\u2019d made the choice to give up his freedom to stay with his family and help them in their captivity. Fergus had sacrificed others in his cause; Liam was sacrificing himself, just as he had when he\u2019d stepped forward and taken the whipping to spare Connor pain.</p><p>Kim got reluctantly to her feet, trying to brush off the worst of the dirt she\u2019d rolled in. Liam was already looking, quick gaze darting everywhere as he skirted the dust in the corner that had been Fergus. He didn\u2019t show much remorse about killing his clan leader, but Fergus had been nuts. Also, she knew the man wouldn\u2019t have gone meekly home, promising to stop his experiments: I\u2019m sorry, Liam, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been a bad Shifter.</p><p>Kim thought about Fergus\u2019s mates, and the offspring Fergus had mentioned. Would they mourn him? Would they try to exact revenge on Liam or move on with their lives? What would Liam, as clan leader, do to them? Would all of those Shifters down in San Antonio accept him without rancor? This would be interesting to watch\u2014interesting being a euphemism for scary.</p><p>Behind her, Liam said, \u201cHere it is.\u201d</p><p>She swung back to find Liam holding the thin silver and black chain as if it was a poisonous snake. Kim chewed her lip as he gripped the ends, one plain, one with the Celtic knot, in his white-knuckled fists.</p><p>\u201cWill it work?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce it\u2019s on me again, it should. Justin said that Brian\u2019s experiments let him figure out how to unfuse the Collars from us, not disable the chips inside. He hadn\u2019t got that far, yet.\u201d Liam took a long breath. \u201cThis will hurt me, Kim. You should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t want you seeing me weak and pathetic, love. A Shifter\u2019s got his pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, I\u2019ve seen you strong, crazed, violent, angry, happy, sad, and far gone in passion. I love every single one of those, especially the last one. Did you know your pupils widen when you come? It\u2019s like you want to take all of me in, forever. It\u2019s very sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it, now? Well, this won\u2019t be. It wasn\u2019t pretty the first time I put on a Collar, and I don\u2019t imagine this will be much better.\u201d</p><p>Kim folded her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I\u2019m your mate, remember? In the traditional human wedding ceremony, we promise to stick together for better or worse. That means not just when everything\u2019s pretty, but when it\u2019s bad, very bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking there\u2019s no line in there about watching your Shifter mate take his Collar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot last time I checked, but the idea is the same.\u201d</p><p>Liam looked down at the Collar, chest rising sharply. \u201cI can\u2019t lie to you, Kim. It\u2019s a bit easier knowing you\u2019re near me.\u201d He looked up, his eyes clear, dark blue, full of fear and full of love. \u201cWish me luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>A hint of his warm, wicked smile touched his mouth. \u201cLove you too, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He studied the Collar a long moment, then took another sharp breath and lifted the chain to his throat.</p><p>Liam\u2019s muscles tightened as the Collar settled against his neck. Kim had no idea how the thing fastened, but as he touched the bare end to the Celtic knot, she heard a loud click, and then Liam screamed.</p><p>Cords stood out on his neck, and his entire body arched backward. He balled his fists and clenched his teeth, fighting the agony.</p><p>Kim rushed to him. Shifters comforted and helped each other with touch\u2014maybe she could ease him a little bit if she could hold him. Liam thrashed as spasms racked his body, his screams becoming hoarse cries.</p><p>She reached for him. \u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>Liam focused on her, his eyes white-blue. \u201cNo, Kim. Stay back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me.\u201d Kim grabbed his wrists, but he snapped them away from her.</p><p>\u201cI said stay back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I said, you need me.\u201d</p><p>Kim darted between his hands and slid her arms around his sweating waist. His skin was ice-cold. She rubbed his back, trying to warm him.</p><p>\u201cKim, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me,\u201d she repeated firmly.</p><p>Liam drew breath after shuddering breath. He stood stiffly, body shaking at the same time. Then with a cry of agony, he wrapped his arms around her and buried his face in her neck.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>How long they stood like that\u2014arms locked around each other, Liam rocking in pain\u2014Kim didn\u2019t know. She held him while his hot tears dropped to her shoulder, while he kissed her neck and held her as if he\u2019d never let her go.</p><p>Kim heard shouting outside. She lifted her head to see that the warehouse had grown darker, the rain still pelting but more softly now, the storm over. Flashlights cut through the gloom, and then the tall forms of Sean and Dylan emerged out of the darkness. Others trailed behind them\u2014Glory, Ellison, Connor, Nate, and Spike.</p><p>Dylan played his flashlight on the two of them in the middle of the warehouse, Liam filthy and naked, Kim in rumpled clothes and probably just as filthy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She called to them, \u201cHe put the Collar back on and the pain is tearing him up.\u201d</p><p>Dylan approached, but the others hung back. Liam managed to lift his head, his eyes filled with incredible pain. \u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>Dylan stopped just shy of Liam, eyes troubled. \u201cDo you want me, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he wants you,\u201d Kim said. \u201cYou\u2019re his dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s clan leader now,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cAnd pride leader. He can reject me if he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Kim shook her head. \u201cHe told me once that he wouldn\u2019t fight you because he loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. People\u2019s status might change, but love stays the same.\u201d</p><p>Dylan opened his mouth to argue, but Connor jerked away from Ellison, who was trying to hold him back. The lanky boy charged past Dylan and threw his arms around both Liam and Kim. \u201cDamn it, we thought Fergus would kill you,\u201d he sobbed.</p> <p>The others tensed, Dylan taking a step back.</p><p>Liam looked up at Connor, his eyes wet. Connor held him tighter, and Liam\u2019s eyes flicked from feral white to beautiful blue. He wrapped an arm around Connor and pulled him close.</p><p>Like water released from a dam, the others flowed to them. Dylan clamped his arms around Liam and Connor, gathering them in. Sean laid down his sword and joined the group hug, followed by Glory, Ellison, and to Kim\u2019s astonishment, both of Fergus\u2019s thugs.</p><p>Kim\u2019s eyes filled as Sean leaned his head into Liam\u2019s neck. Kim could feel the warmth, the caring, in the huddle, heard the soothing words they whispered to each other. She was squished between Dylan and Liam, Ellison and Connor. She started to giggle. \u201cA Kim sandwich.\u201d</p><p>Ellison laughed his big, booming Texas laughter. \u201cSounds good. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so disgusting,\u201d Glory said to him. She had her arms firmly around Dylan\u2019s waist.</p> <p>Ellison gave Glory a big kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou love it, darling. I say we all blow this place and go get shit-faced drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Spike said.</p><p>Liam\u2019s immediate family remained silent. Kim felt the energy flowing between them, love that had kept them alive and together all these years. And now they wanted her to be part of it.</p><p>\u201cDrunk,\u201d Liam rasped. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how good that sounds.\u201d</p><p>The group began to part, slowly, smiling the unembarrassed smiles of people who\u2019d shared a happy experience. Sean rubbed Liam lightly on the back and moved to pick up first his sword and then Liam\u2019s clothes.</p><p>Connor gave Liam one last squeeze, then backed off, wiping his eyes. Dylan was the last to leave. He held Liam\u2019s arms and looked straight into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Liam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you will. You\u2019ve been moving toward this moment all your life. It\u2019s yours now.\u201d</p><p>Liam put his hands on his father\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWith you at my back, Dad, there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>Dylan relaxed, as though he\u2019d still been waiting for Liam\u2019s acceptance. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d He pulled Liam down to him and pressed a kiss to Liam\u2019s forehead. He finally turned away, eyes full.</p><p>Liam reached for Kim\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you all right? Did I hurt you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m resilient.\u201d Kim kissed his lips, and Liam crushed her to him in a long, satisfying hug. \u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you up to the walk?\u201d Sean asked, handing Liam his clothes.</p><p>Liam hugged his T-shirt and jeans to his chest and looked around at the assembly, a hint of the old glint in his eye. \u201cAre you telling me that none of you thought to bring wheels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Connor said. \u201cAs soon as the storm let up, we ran out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you were thinking you\u2019d trundle me back in a wheelbarrow, all hurt and bloody? This is the planning of my friends and family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll run and get my car,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t room for everyone, but that\u2019s all right. I can take Liam home, at least.\u201d</p><p>Liam gripped her wrist. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t go yet.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were desperate. Kim gave him a reassuring smile and a little hug. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>Glory swayed forward. She was wearing sturdy boots for once, though they had three-inch heels. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d She plucked the keys out of Kim\u2019s fingers and gave Kim a big tooth-filled smile. \u201cI\u2019ll take good care of it. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Liam lay in his bed in heavy sleep next to Kim for about four hours after they got home. Then he woke up, threw back the covers, and declared he needed to go to the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Kim demanded, not liking the absence of his warmth in the small bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken too many days off. The paperwork in the office must be a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>Liam stopped in the act of leaning over for his pants, his delectable backside in full view. \u201cI\u2019m all right, love. Shifters heal fast.\u201d</p><p>Maybe their bodies did. \u201cWhy do you work at the bar at all? You don\u2019t seem to live paycheck to paycheck. And how did Fergus afford all that artwork in his basement? How did he even afford that huge basement?\u201d</p><p>Liam sat back down, his eyes a mystery. \u201cShifters live a long time. We accumulate things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike money and Old Masters paintings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike money and Old Masters paintings. Which Dad thinks should be sold to a museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to explain where you got them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d Liam reached for his jeans again and pulled them up. \u201cThere are dealers who will work with us discreetly.\u201d</p><p>Kim sat cross-legged against the headboard. \u201cBefore I came down here the first time, I thought I knew every little thing about Shifters. I didn\u2019t know jack, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Liam\u2019s smile flashed in the harsh lamplight. \u201cI thought I knew all about humans. You taught me so much.\u201d He stopped. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, love.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s heart skipped a beat, then gave a hard bang. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018miss me\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Liam sank to the bed again, one blue-jeaned leg folded under him. The red gashes on his torso had closed, the heavy bruising already fading. A dark swirl of hair covered his chest and pointed to his navel, the indentation into which she\u2019d slid her finger the night he\u2019d first brought her up to his room.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cGo back to living your own life.\u201d</p><p>She stared. \u201cHold on. For days you insist I stay here, whether I like it or not. Tonight, after all that\u2019s happened, not to mention the incredible sex, you\u2019re telling me to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus is dead. His followers have gone home. His threat is removed. No one will be taking off any more Shifter Collars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound very sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure. I lead the clan now, which means our pride is now first. No other Shifter will dare harm you, whether they approve of you or not. My protection is on you, and no other Shifter can override that.\u201d</p><p>Kim slid out of bed. She wasn\u2019t wearing anything, but at the moment, it didn\u2019t seem important. \u201cWhat about this mate thing? That\u2019s all gone now too?\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cThat will never be gone. We\u2019ve been mated under the sun and moon, the mating recognized by the clan. We\u2019ll always be mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Shifters, it means I take no other mate. For humans, it means\u2014nothing. A Shifter mating isn\u2019t valid in the human world; it\u2019s not marriage. I remember you telling me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant, what does it mean to you?\u201d</p><p>Liam looked away. \u201cIt means everything to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you telling me to leave?\u201d</p><p>Liam got to his feet, looked across the bed at her. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t stay. You\u2019ve tried to pound it into my brain all this time why you can\u2019t. I\u2019m a Shifter. I can love you with everything I\u2019ve got, but I\u2019ll ruin you, and you know it. You\u2019ll lose your job, your friends, your respectability. I\u2019m from the wrong side of the tracks, darling. Not from your world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple\u2014Shifters bad, humans good. I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do. But the rest of the world doesn\u2019t. Not yet. Maybe in another twenty years, when people are used to us. Right now, I love you enough not to keep you here.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly cold, Kim reached for a long T-shirt and dragged it over her head. It was one of Liam\u2019s, too big for her and carrying his scent.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come over all altruistic on me, Liam Morrissey. Like you haven\u2019t put me through enough hell already. You made me love you, damn it. Really love you. Now you\u2019re saying, \u2018Thanks, Kim, go away\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think this is easy for me?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cWhen my Collar was off, I wanted nothing more than to lock you away upstairs and never let you go. No matter how much you screamed or begged or told me off, which is more likely what you\u2019d do. I wanted to imprison you here with me. Mine. Forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Collar is back on, now,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that fact cancels everything out? It doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m still feral. I always have been, always will be.\u201d Liam tapped the Collar around his bruised neck. \u201cThis keeps it down so I don\u2019t destroy myself, my people, and everyone I love. All Shifters are like me. Wild beasts in captivity. Not domesticated. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>Kim folded her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re foolish. You saw me. I was ready to kill a child, my own brother, my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because Fergus distracted me, love. Thank the Goddess he did, because he drew my fury. If he hadn\u2019t been there for me to fight, I would have destroyed everyone I loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t take your Collar off again,\u201d Kim said. \u201cEnd of worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Fergus was right. We need to be free of the Collars someday. He was in too much of a hurry, but he wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d</p><p>Kim balled her fists. \u201cMake up your mind. Do you want the Collar on or off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters are getting stronger, love. We were dying off before, which is why we needed to capitulate with the humans and take the Collars. To let us live again, regroup, regain our strength. When we\u2019re powerful enough again, we\u2019ll rid ourselves of our chains, and be who we are supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I have no place in that world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Liam stood with his hands on his hips, his body still, eyes dark.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying to me,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as good as you are at reading body language, but even I can tell you\u2019re coming up with excuses for sending me away. You think it\u2019s for my own good.\u201d</p><p>Liam whirled suddenly and punched the headboard. It cracked, wood splintering. \u201cYou\u2019re maddening, Kim, did you know that? Of course it\u2019s for your own good. You have your career, your life, your pretty house, your friends. I want you to have that. Find yourself a normal man, not one who might go crazy on you, not one who has to pretend to be a bar manager while he runs Shiftertown. Go home and be human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Go, Kim. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it matter that I love you?\u201d she asked, throat hurting.</p><p>\u201cYes, that matters. It matters a lot.\u201d Liam reached across the bed and touched the bruise on her lip. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all the more reason I want you gone. I need to know I can\u2019t hurt you, ever again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kim stood still under his touch, her heart constricting. She\u2019d broken up with men before, had sometimes done the breaking herself. She recognized Liam\u2019s look, the implacable expression of someone who\u2019d made the painful decision to walk away and wouldn\u2019t be talked out of it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d she said. Kim knew how pathetic she sounded, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me glad that you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Liam touched her lip once more, then took up his shirt and boots from the floor. \u201cBut it\u2019s all the more reason you need to.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another long look, as though he were memorizing her, then turned and walked out. He shut the door behind him, and a few minutes later, the front door\u2019s banging shook the house. Kim heard his motorcycle rev, heard its throb as he drove off down the street, the noise dying into the distance.</p> <p>Kim stood by the bed for a long time, staring at the closed door. Tears choked her throat, but her burning eyes wouldn\u2019t shed any.</p><p>She heard the others downstairs, talking, their voices inquiring. Wondering where Liam was off to? Or had he told them he was sending Kim home?</p><p>Suddenly she wanted nothing more than to get out of there. Kim dressed with numb fingers, packed what things she\u2019d brought here, and carried them down to her Mustang.</p><p>The last thing she saw as she backed out of the Morrissey driveway was Connor standing under the glow of the front porch light, his arms folded, a look of vast sadness on his face.</p><p>Kim arrived at her office early the next morning, dressed in a conservative gray suit.</p> <p>\u201cNo Shifters today?\u201d her secretary asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jeanne.\u201d Kim\u2019s voice had gone cold and hard, the take-no-shit defense lawyer returning. \u201cNo more Shifters in the office. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jeanne, used to years of Kim\u2019s ups and downs, smiled at her. \u201cToo bad. He sure was hot.\u201d</p><p>Kim had to admit that yes, he sure was. Her gut was so churned up that she didn\u2019t know what she was feeling. Loss, pain, sorrow, anger. Liam had thrown her out. That hurt. But hadn\u2019t Kim told Liam repeatedly that she couldn\u2019t stay? She wasn\u2019t certain who provoked the most anger, herself or Liam.</p><p>Once at her desk, Kim immediately dove into Brian\u2019s case. Arguing with the prosecutor\u2019s office helped keep her thoughts from Liam\u2014from the traumatic fight in the warehouse, from the amazing sex afterward.</p><p>She worked all day, her businesslike suit and panty hose more confining by the hour. She\u2019d gotten used to loose skirts and sandals far too quickly.</p> <p>The next day wasn\u2019t any better, though the monotony was interrupted by a call from Silas.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Liam,\u201d Silas told her. \u201cHe\u2019s agreed to let me interview him for the documentary, and for the feature stories for the newspaper. He\u2019s going to show me around Shiftertown himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d It really was great. Trust Liam to begin his rule of Shiftertown by doing what Fergus would have loathed. But Liam wanted the world to stop fearing Shifters, to move toward freedom. Showing the world what Shifters truly were was a first step.</p><p>A few weeks later, Kim\u2019s hard work and persistence finally paid off. With her tip on the jealous ex-boyfriend angle, her investigator had found out Michelle\u2019s ex had been boasting that he\u2019d brought the Shifters to their knees and about his obsessive behavior toward Michelle before her death. He\u2019d started calling her \u201cthe f**king Shifter-whore who\u2019d got what she deserved.\u201d That was enough for police to reopen the case and bring the guy in again for further questioning. He\u2019d been reluctant to talk about Michelle at all, until the detective revealed evidence of photos on the young man\u2019s digital camera of Michelle lying strangled on the floor. A vitriolic confession came pouring out. Michelle had betrayed him\u2014with a Shifter. Michelle should die, and the Shifter should be ripped apart. If there were any justice in the world, he\u2019d be given a medal for ridding the world of filth.</p><p>After that, it wasn\u2019t too difficult for Kim to get the prosecutors to dismiss the case against Brian, who was released to a surge of publicity. Kim walked with him, under the scrutiny of black camera lenses the day he was freed, to where Sandra waited in her old car. Mother and son had a tearful reunion, but Kim could see Brian\u2019s grief over Michelle. Sandra had confirmed that Brian had been prepared to take Michelle as his mate, and her loss was hard for him. He\u2019d truly loved her.</p><p>After seeing Brian off, Kim returned to her office and went to see her boss.</p><p>The head of the firm was a large man with graying hair and pictures of his wife and four children on his desk. \u201cGood work, Kim,\u201d he said, a man who rarely praised. \u201cBut I doubt we\u2019ll be getting any more Shifter cases. People wanted Shifter blood, and we just made the prosecutor\u2019s office look stupid.\u201d</p><p>Kim shrugged, not caring about the damned prosecutor\u2019s office right now. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I came to tender my resignation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His thick brows shot up. \u201cWhy? You\u2019ve just won the biggest case of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m contemplating a business venture of my own. Human advocate and legal liaison to Shifters in the Austin\u2013San Antonio area. Want in?\u201d</p><p>Her boss sat there with his mouth open, then moved his nameplate from one side of his desk to the other, which he did when he got nervous. \u201cAre you crazy, Kim? You\u2019re a good attorney. One of my best. You\u2019re on your way to a terrific career. You throw in with Shifters and you\u2019ll be finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifter-human law needs to be reevaluated and changed,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt will be a challenge, something to live for. You could make your mark as a champion of Shifter rights. You love defending people\u2019s rights.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the photos on his desk. \u201cBut Shifter-haters can be dangerous, and I wouldn\u2019t be risking just myself.\u201d</p><p>Kim nodded, understanding. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have anyone but myself to risk. I\u2019m tired of living an empty life, so I\u2019m going to fill it doing something crazy like helping Shifters wade through the morass of law. Jeanne\u2019s agreed to go with me. She\u2019s training as a paralegal, and she\u2019s excited about getting a chance for more experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s as crazy as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Kim conceded. \u201cBut that\u2019s what we want to do. Thanks for taking me on when I was a green law-school graduate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d her boss said faintly. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>Kim dragged in a breath as she left her boss\u2019s office, the words Good luck ringing in her head. She knew she\u2019d need it.</p><p>Kim spent the next weeks cleaning out her office and finding space to rent for her new office, a tiny one with enough room for herself and Jeanne. The others in the firm agreed with the head, that Kim was crazy. Some admired her; some openly castigated her, Abel in particular.</p><p>Kim ignored them and bought office furniture. Jeanne was an enthusiastic partner and even helped take Kim\u2019s mind off her sorrows for five minutes now and again.</p><p>The first day Kim spent at her new office, Silas e-mailed her some video files for the Shifter documentary he was working on, asking for her feedback.</p><p>Kim played the files, her heart aching. There was a lot of footage of Liam smiling his warm smile and speaking in his deep Irish lilt, telling Silas what he wanted the world to know about Shifters. Dylan spoke too, giving the same details but in a different enough way that it didn\u2019t sound as though they\u2019d worked it out beforehand. Kim knew they had. She also knew exactly what they had decided to leave out.</p><p>There was footage of how the Shifters lived from day to day, shots of Michael playing in his front yard. Michael was photogenic, and his cuteness radiated from the screen. Silas also showed Connor and his friends kicking a soccer ball around the backyards, Connor talking about his love of \u201cfootball\u201d and what a fan he was of the Irish national team.</p><p>Silas didn\u2019t show only sparkles and smiles, however. He talked to Shifters about the darker side of their lives\u2014the high death rate of Shifter children, which had started to come down only in the last decade, the low fecundity of the females. He talked about how the different Shifter species didn\u2019t get along \u201cin the wild\u201d but had made concessions to live together in harmony. Ellison was particularly eloquent in that segment, looking handsome with his big cowboy hat and wide smile.</p><p>A group of Shifters did a Collar \u201cdemonstration,\u201d which proved that Collars worked well, and Silas showed a meditation by some Shifter parents for children they\u2019d lost.</p><p>Kim viewed the files again and again, pausing on Liam\u2019s smile, his blue eyes assuring the viewers that Shifters were little different from humans.</p><p>She watched the recording far too often. And far too often, she opened her cell phone and looked at Liam\u2019s number, wondering if she should tell him all the things she\u2019d decided.</p><p>\u201cCall me anytime, love,\u201d he\u2019d said, when he\u2019d programmed the number into it weeks ago.</p><p>Damn Shifters.</p><p>In the cool of late September, Kim came home from her new office on a Friday and spent the weekend packing.</p><p>Sunday afternoon, she put everything in her car that she could fit. She\u2019d get help with the rest. She closed the trunk, started the car, and drove back to Shiftertown.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Liam knew the car was Kim\u2019s without looking up. He crouched in the driveway beside his motorcycle, wrench in hand, completing a few tweaks to his bike.</p><p>He\u2019d ridden this motorcycle to the posh neighborhood north of the river every night for the last two months, cutting the engine before he reached the hill above Kim\u2019s house. He\u2019d sit there for a long time, the bike silent between his legs, watching her lighted bedroom window. When the light went out, Liam would kiss his fingertips to it, then coast back down the hill and ride home.</p><p>The hole in his heart wanted to close in hope as she stopped the Mustang and climbed out. She wore the high-heeled sandals he liked, ones that made her bare legs sexy as hell.</p><p>He watched the legs out of the corner of his eye as she strode up the driveway, letting her scent flow over him as she walked past him.</p><p>Walked past him?</p><p>Liam looked around to see Kim shove a cardboard box at Connor, who\u2019d bounded out of the house.</p><p>\u201cWill you carry that in for me?\u201d Kim asked Connor sweetly. \u201cPut it anywhere. I have a couple more in the trunk.\u201d</p><p>Kim returned to the car, again moving past Liam without speaking to him. She reached through the open passenger window, giving him a view of her nice ass, and pulled out an overnight bag.</p><p>\u201cHello, Sean.\u201d Kim smiled as Sean came out of the house behind Connor. \u201cCan you grab the suitcases in my backseat? They\u2019re heavy.\u201d</p><p>She waltzed up the driveway, a determined smile on her face, bag slung over her shoulder.</p><p>Liam wiped his hands, stood, and planted himself in her path. \u201cAnd what would you be doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving in. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pay for my share of the groceries.\u201d</p><p>Kim started to go around him, and Liam stepped in front of her again. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with her, Liam,\u201d Connor said, carrying the second box from the trunk. He rubbed Kim\u2019s shoulder as he went past her, like a cat to a litter mate. \u201cShe\u2019s back to stay, where she belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe belongs with her own kind,\u201d Liam said sternly.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Connor said. \u201cWe need her, Liam, you especially. You\u2019ve been pissed off for weeks. Don\u2019t mess this up.\u201d</p><p>Sean, Liam\u2019s dear supportive brother, didn\u2019t offer any comment. He silently removed Kim\u2019s suitcases from the backseat and carried them inside.</p><p>Liam\u2019s breath hurt. Gods, Kim was beautiful. Her dark hair looked shinier than ever, her eyes a deeper blue, her full br**sts making his hands itch to cup them. If he did that right now, he\u2019d leave greasy handprints on her pretty white shirt, and wouldn\u2019t everyone laugh? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy, love?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy are you back to tear out my heart?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with you. I want our kid to know its father, and when it first changes into a wildcat, he or she will need someone who knows what to do standing by.\u201d</p><p>Liam stopped. \u201cKid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little half-Shifter boy or girl. I don\u2019t know which; haven\u2019t had an ultrasound yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUltrasound...\u201d</p><p>Kim laughed in true mirth. \u201cYou knocked me up, Liam Morrissey. Now you have to live with the consequences.\u201d</p><p>Connor came running out of the house, whooped, and punched the air. \u201cKim\u2019s pregnant! Woo-hoo!\u201d He hurtled toward Kim, caught her in a hug and swung her off her feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a cousin!\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s shouting drew people outside. Glory emerged first, sauntering down her porch stairs, her tight leopard-print pants startling. Dylan strolled out behind her. He\u2019d moved in with Glory the day after Kim left, further emptying the house.</p><p>\u201cDid I hear that right?\u201d Glory called. \u201cYou\u2019re up the spout?\u201d</p> <p>Kim drew a breath once Connor finally put her down. \u201cConfirmed by my gynecologist last week.\u201d</p><p>Liam kept wiping his hands on the rag. \u201cI thought you took contraceptives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was coming up on the end of my dose, and we had a lot of sex, Liam, if you recall. And maybe Shifter sperm are livelier than human\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShite,\u201d Liam said around the lump in his throat.</p><p>More neighbors emerged onto front porches, and Ellison came around from his backyard, shirtless, his jeans covered with dirt and grass stains. When Ellison understood what was going on, he put his hands on his hips, threw back his head, and howled. Answering howls came from up and down the street.</p><p>Great. How long before the news reached the other side of Shiftertown? Five minutes? Two?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m staying, Liam,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWhether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods.\u201d Liam threw down the oily rag and caught Kim in his arms, damn the stains. He crushed Kim against him, lips finding her hair, her face, her mouth. \u201cI love you, Kim. Don\u2019t ever leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed his cheek. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Liam had driven her away to keep her safe, most of all from himself. But having her in his arms again, smelling her, tasting her, hearing her voice\u2014it broke him, defeated the beast inside him. The feral in him crumpled as surely as Fergus had crumpled under the Guardian\u2019s sword.</p><p>Liam held her tighter. \u201cYou\u2019re all mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betcha.\u201d</p> <p>Liam touched his forehead to hers. \u201cI love you so damn much.\u201d</p><p>Kim grinned at him. \u201cAnd I adore you.\u201d</p><p>Liam gave her a long, heartfelt kiss. She got into it, sliding her arms around him to cup his butt, snaking her fingers into his back pockets. She was a loving, warm, sexy woman. How\u2019d he get so damn lucky?</p><p>Liam eased back from the kiss, licking the light bruise he\u2019d already put on her lip. He\u2019d learn how to be gentle with her, tender. And then he\u2019d be wild. The sparkle in her eyes told him she wanted it both ways.</p><p>As soon as he raised his head, they were hit by the family. First Connor, still shouting, throwing his arms around both Liam and Kim. Then Sean, laughing, catching Liam in a bear hug, rubbing Kim\u2019s shoulders and kissing her cheek.</p><p>Dylan, his eyes full, holding Liam hard, then Kim. Kim gasped when Glory flung her arms around her, squeezing her.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, kid,\u201d she said.</p><p>And then Ellison, whooping and howling like the Lupine he was, jerking Liam off his feet in a rough embrace. \u201cYou virile shit, you. Taking the best woman for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Glory said.</p><p>Ellison draped his arms around Connor and Sean. \u201cThis calls for a beer.\u201d He started with them for the house, his way of leaving Liam and Kim tactfully alone. Glory followed, after a look at Dylan.</p><p>\u201cSeamus,\u201d Connor was saying. \u201cPatrick, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Ellison asked him.</p><p>\u201cNames for the wee one. Eoghan, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive the kid a break. Who the hell could spell that?\u201d</p><p>The house swallowed them. Dylan put his hands on Kim\u2019s and Liam\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThe Goddess bless you both.\u201d He kissed Kim\u2019s forehead. \u201cThank you, Kim.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and walked away. Liam watched him, his heart full.</p><p>\u201cIs he thanking me for getting pregnant?\u201d Kim asked. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t difficult, with all the sex we kept having. You did as much as I did.\u201d</p><p>Liam pulled her against him again. She belonged there, felt so right fitted to him. \u201cHe meant for coming back to us. For keeping us a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t difficult, either.\u201d She gave him a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about where I belong, Liam. This is the kind of family I had before my brother died, one of warmth and laughter, of knowing the house was full every night. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been looking for in the last decade or so, even when I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d Kim looked up at him, her blue eyes full of love. \u201cI belong right here. With you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d break his heart all right. Or maybe she\u2019d finally heal it. Liam pulled her close, his lips meeting hers.</p><p>Damn, kissing the human way was good. How could he have never liked it before?</p><p>Because he\u2019d never done it with Kim before.</p><p>Kim caught his lower lip between her teeth, and Liam felt the front of his jeans get unbearably tight. He murmured in her ear, \u201cDo you think we can make it upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for trying.\u201d Her gaze turned sultry. \u201cBesides, they\u2019re shouting so much, they\u2019ll cover up all the noise I plan to make.\u201d</p><p>Liam squeezed her, growling. \u201cI love you, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>They did make it past the mob and up the stairs. Dylan saw them go, but he only smiled quietly and turned away.</p><p>The door closed, the lock locked. Clothes came off, and Liam had Kim naked against him. His heart was whole, his brain clear, and his body melting with desire. Kim\u2019s smile put him over the top.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Liam,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Liam said brokenly. \u201cI\u2019ll love you forever.\u201d</p><p>They had strong, bed-shaking, wet, and sweaty sex that drowned out even the revelry downstairs.</p><p>Liam\u2019s brother, nephew, friends, and every member of his clan never let them hear the end of it. </p> </body></html>"]
