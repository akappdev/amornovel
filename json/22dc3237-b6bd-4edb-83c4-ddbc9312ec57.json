I can\u2019t feel anything anymore.</p><p>\u2014Elliott, E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial, 1982</p> <p>Riley\u2019s not the same since she lost Eli. She\u2019s . . . hardened. Closed down. She lets off just enough emotion to seem human. I can tell her brain has given up hope. But her heart hasn\u2019t. And that makes her dangerous and unpredictable. If anything, I can read a woman. And I\u2019m reading her right. Which means I\u2019ll just have to keep a closer eye on her. She\u2019ll either love me for it or kick my ass. I\u2019m betting on the latter.</p><p>\u2014Noah Miles</p><p>It\u2019s cold here. Ice cold. The kind that burrows straight through your skin and jabs deep into your bones. I can\u2019t shake it. I inhale, and that frigid air rushes down my windpipe and bangs into my lungs. It clings to my insides, and I puff it back out. Funny. No frosty air comes from my mouth. I\u2019m more cold-blooded than warm-blooded, I think. My core temperature isn\u2019t even human enough to heat my breath. What does that make me? Hell if I know. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing here. My eyes drifted shut, and the next thing I know, I\u2019m here, in this place. Something wants me. That much I know. I can feel it.</p><p>As I jog up the darkened street, I notice how barren it is here, too. No trees. No grass. No shrubs. Not even a single bird. Only gray concrete, gray sidewalk, gray stone, gray sky. Even as I fine-tune my hearing, nothing happens. No beatings of hearts\u2014not even a rat\u2019s. Is there nothing alive here? Am I? Hell if I know.</p><p>I let my hands skim the building\u2019s stone surface as I turn the corner. My body is pressed close to the stone, and I peer ahead. A heavy mist has crept in, fallen over the ground like some white vaporous blanket. It swirls around my feet as I walk, and the farther I go, the higher it climbs. Soon, it surrounds me. I see nothing. I hear nothing.</p> <p>Then the stench knocks into me, full force. It\u2019s many things, all rolled in one. Rancid old blood. Decay. Rotting human flesh. Scorched tissue. The more steps I take, the stronger the scent becomes. I follow it.</p><p>One second I\u2019m on a cobbled road; the next I\u2019m on the river\u2019s bank. The mist rolls across the black water like a live thing, and the stench seems to come from below. The loch. I ease down the embankment. I stop at the water\u2019s edge, and inhale. That horrible smell of death is coming from beneath the water.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so easy.\u201d A voice sounds from behind me. \u201cToo easy.\u201d</p><p>That voice. I whip around, but the speaker\u2019s strong arm has snaked around my throat and pulled me tightly against him. Yeah, a male. Big. Hard. The back of my head presses against his chest. There\u2019s no heartbeat. What a shock.</p><p>Just as I move to raise my foot, his muscular leg traps mine. He drops his free arm over my breasts and pulls me closer. He thinks I\u2019m thoroughly trapped. I let him think it. His head drops to my ear.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t decide if I want to fuck you, then kill you.\u201d His graveled voice brushes against my cheek. \u201cOr just kill you.\u201d He pulls me closer, and I feel his hard cock press into my back. \u201cDifficult decision.\u201d</p> <p>I look down at the arm holding me prisoner. Leather jacket, leather gloves. Vise as tight as iron. My head falls to the side, exposing my neck, and I move my ass seductively against his crotch. \u201cHow \u2019bout now?\u201d I ask, my voice low, teasing. I peer into the loch, but it\u2019s cloudy with mist. I can\u2019t see his face. I can\u2019t see anything.</p><p>His laugh against my throat is deep, more like a whisper. Edged with certain . . . hatred. Yet . . . there\u2019s something about it. I don\u2019t know. \u201cConvince me,\u201d he says. His teeth graze my skin. \u201cTell me what you\u2019ll do to me if I let you live.\u201d His lips move to the corner of mine, and it\u2019s an achingly familiar gesture. \u201cMake me want you.\u201d</p><p>With slow, rhythmic pressure, I move against his groin, pushing against the thick bulge. His body tenses at my movement, and I know he\u2019s turned on. I don\u2019t know why, but I am, too. I gotta get my head back in the game. That is, to live.</p><p>\u201cI can make you come without laying a hand on you,\u201d I whisper, and I press my back into his chest.</p><p>His arm that is still banded over my breasts slides, and through the thin silk of my bra, his hand cups me. I press my ass against his crotch, and he hardens. \u201cAnd how would you do that?\u201d he whispers against my jaw.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re going to touch me,\u201d I answer, and before the words fully leave my mouth, his hand leaves my breast and skims my stomach. \u201cAnd when you do, I\u2019ll explode.\u201d A moan escapes my throat, and my vision blurs. I blink. I gotta get it together. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t be able to help yourself. You\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>His gloved hand moves over my hip, over my groin, and I thrust against him. He cups me, his thumb pressing against me through my jeans. Just as the climax starts, his grip relaxes and he starts to turn me around. I go limp, and slide to the ground. In the next second, I leap, and I land, crouched, about ten feet away. Through the mist, I blink. The orgasm still lingers, and I will it away.</p><p>I look at my captor.</p> <p>My breath hitches.</p><p>My mouth opens to call his name.</p><p>\u201cE\u2014\u201d</p><p>Just that fast, he\u2019s on me again. His hand encircles my throat, and his face contorts to full-raged vampire. His jaw juts forward, almost broken, and jagged teeth drop from his gums. His eyes turn bloodred, and his scent blends with that in the loch. The air is squeaking from my lungs, so audible I can hear it in the misty air around me. He lifts me, my feet dangling over the water.</p><p>\u201cYou will die now,\u201d he says, and lowers me to the loch. \u201cAnd watching the life drain out of you is what\u2019s going to make me come.\u201d</p><p>I try to kick, to shout, but I\u2019m paralyzed. Screams not my own pierce the air, and he starts to lower me down. The stench grows stronger. I feel water at my back, and hands upon hands pull at me from below. He holds me there, my face and eyes just beneath the surface of the loch, staring up at him through the water. Had he not been squeezing the life out of me, I would have died from just seeing his face. Full of hate. Full of loathing.</p><p>A monster.</p><p>It\u2019s Eli.</p><p>As I thrash about, and what little air is left in me seeps out, my lungs explode. Unseen hands grab me from the depths of the loch, and before the blood vessels burst in my eyes, I see the others who have gone in before me. . . .</p><p>\u201cHey, Ri.\u201d A familiar voice seeps into my conscience. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I\u2019m speechless. Slowly, I open my eyes. I can\u2019t focus. I can\u2019t speak.</p><p>He grasps my forearm and squeezes gently. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with you, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I blink and focus. It\u2019s only Noah. And we\u2019re in a cab.</p><p>Noah flashes his big white, wolfish smile at me. \u201cAnything I can help you with, babe?\u201d</p><p>With a heavy sigh, I push my thumb and forefinger into my eye sockets. \u201cNo. Bad dream is all.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re here. You okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Weird. I remember driving along on the A-96, looking out across the Moray Firth. That\u2019s it. As I glance out the window into the night, I see we\u2019ve ended up on Montague Row, at the guesthouse Jake Andorra, our boss, rented out for us. Rented the whole damn guesthouse so we wouldn\u2019t look so suspicious coming and going like we do.</p><p>WUP. Worldwide Unexplained Phenomena. That\u2019s what we do. It\u2019s an elite organization Noah and I, and a handful of others, belong to. Weirdly enough, I\u2019m probably the most normal of the group. WUP is made up of vampires, werewolves, ancient Pict immortals with wicked skills and sick fighting abilities. Then there\u2019s, well, me. A human with vampiric tendencies. So far, I\u2019m the only one. Jake Andorra, a vampire with lethal skills, asked me to join. Although I\u2019m pretty sure most of my team members would argue my tendencies have gotten way the hell out of control. But damn\u2014I\u2019ve been bitten by three powerful Strigoi vampires from an old Romanian family, as well as my vampire fianc\u00e9, Eli. All of their DNA bound with mine, and I took on a little of each one of their traits. I can now speak French and Romanian fluently. I guess my mind control is the strongest trait I\u2019ve acquired, and I\u2019d be a big fat liar if I didn\u2019t confess to thinking it was cool as shit. Anyway.</p><p>WUP members are dispatched and assigned the most difficult of cases involving things humans can\u2019t even begin to grasp. Basically, we\u2019re hunters. Anything involving supernatural beings vs. humans, we\u2019re on it. Vampiric situations are the most common, although there\u2019s a pretty big werewolf war going on farther west in the Highlands, which is where the rest of the WUP team is right now.</p><p>A werewolf war. Sounds pretty big, right? Apparently, two clans have waged war between themselves, and once again, innocent mortals inevitably get in the way. Werewolves are bat-shit crazy and unpredictable as all holy hell. WUP will need every spare set of hands they can use. But under Jake Andorra\u2019s orders, me and Noah have been assigned here, in Inverness. Our mission is simple: Take out the rogue vampire or vampires wreaking havoc on innocent humans. Noah\u2019s strength combined with mine is more than enough to wrap up this job. Usually, they\u2019re newbloods\u2014humans newly transformed and just coming into their vampirism. And totally fuck-wild with bloodlust. It\u2019s not too uncommon, rogues. They travel, hardly ever staying in the same location long. But any time is too long. They kill. Innocents die a horrible death.</p><p>So me and Noah will hunt down these rogue vampires and make the humans and city safe again. Shouldn\u2019t take long. But there\u2019s something else I have to do here. Something I have to do alone. And the selfish part of me says it\u2019s more important.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Sometime between the Firth and here, I dreamed. Again of my fianc\u00e9, Eli, except this time was different than the others. It was . . . bizarre. That\u2019s another thing I do\u2014I have wicked dreams that sometimes place me in real situations, and sometimes in other bodies. I almost experience things others have experienced, and it is intense as hell. I shake it off and finally answer Noah. I give a nod. \u201cI\u2019ve never been better. Let\u2019s go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah stares at me a minute, with those calculating mercury vampiric eyes. Finally, he leans over me and opens the cab door. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>I climb out, and the chilled air bites through the black leather jacket I\u2019m wearing. It\u2019s not uncomfortable, the chill. Lately, I welcome it. Seems I\u2019m always hot lately.</p><p>\u201cHere, grab these and I\u2019ll get the rest. Here are the keys to the back entrance.\u201d Noah hands them to me and nods. \u201cJust up the walk there, turn left down that alley.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d I answer, and grab the two duffel bags containing our gear.</p><p>I could have sworn we got in that taxi over an hour ago. It\u2019s only been twenty minutes or so since we landed. Wicked-ass dream that was, and I damn sure don\u2019t want to have another like it. It left me not only aching for Eli, but fearing what he may have become. Stepping away from the curb, I sling one pack over my shoulder and head in the direction Noah indicated. It\u2019s dark, well after sunset. The old gray stone of our Edwardian-era guesthouse blends in with the pale haze lingering in the air. A sign hangs on an iron post that reads ABERNANTHE GUESTHOUSE. NO VACANCY. As the breeze catches the metal sign, it creaks back and forth. The typical city sounds surround me, but I tune them all out and listen close as I walk. Every noise ceases except the very, very faint ones. The lapping of the firth against the shoreline. Seabirds cooing as they bed down for the night. Pigeons. Gulls. Rats scuffling along the cobbles.</p><p>I turn down the narrow close leading to the guesthouse\u2019s back entrance, and a soft breathy sound reaches my ears. My skin breaks out in goose bumps. The fine hairs on my arms and neck stiffen. I\u2019m on total alert, and my eyes scan. I see nothing, but I hear. Breath, but no heartbeat. Shadows reach, stretch in awkward lengths. It\u2019s hard to tell where the stone ends and the shadows begin. Something\u2019s here. I feel it.</p><p>Out of nowhere, a hand encircles my throat. I drop my bags. My feet leave the ground.</p><p>Apparently, there are wily, ballsy vampires afoot in Inverness, Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cWhen all is said and done, Ms. Poe, you\u2019re nothing more than a glorified human armed with pointy little weapons.\u201d The bloodsucker knows my name? He squeezes my throat tighter, lifting me higher off the cobbles. \u201cYou can still die.\u201d His lips pull back, gums recede, and a dozen razor-sharp teeth drop from his top jaw, jagged and lethal as shit. What the hell? I\u2019ve only been out of the cab for three minutes. He pulls me closer. His breath alone nearly knocks me out. It reeks of old metallic blood, flesh, and decay. Sounds like a cool name for a heavy metal band. Blood, Flesh, and Decay . . .</p><p>And the smell is familiar. Like from my dream.</p><p>\u201cWhen all is said and done,\u201d I repeat his words, gasping for breath at the same time, \u201cyou\u2019re still nothing more than an asshole.\u201d My voice is raspy as it pushes past his fierce grip against my windpipe, and my feet aren\u2019t even touching the ground when I rear one leg back and knee this bloodless prick in the groin. His grip loosens, just enough, and his pupils dilate. I see the pain there, in their depths. It\u2019s all I need.</p><p>From the waist of my jeans I palm my silver blade, flip it, and jam it straight into his heart. All within, no lie, the blink of an eye.</p><p>The vampire drops me and falls to the ground. He is seizing, quivering, gurgling. His body starts to smolder, disintegrate, and finally, bubble into that disgusting pile of white junk they become when they meet their end.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even see it coming. Funny how male vampires are way more male human than they like to admit. Target their wieners and wham\u2014on the ground they go.</p> <p>Glorified human with pointy little weapons? Kiss my ass.</p><p>\u201cRiley, what the hell?\u201d</p><p>I glance behind me. Noah Miles is standing on the street side, scowling down the narrow alley I\u2019m standing in. He swaggers toward me, his gaze lowering to the quivering pile of used-to-be vampire. Mercury eyes flash so angrily, they almost glow in the dark. Ever since Edinburgh, he\u2019s smothered the hell out of me. Edgy, watchful, and overly mother hennish. He gets on my fucking nerves. Everybody does, actually.</p><p>\u201cI liked you better when you were just a horny, whimsical old vampire,\u201d I say under my breath, and then sigh with frustration. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley. You left me, like, ten seconds ago.\u201d</p><p>I look at my WUP partner. \u201cI was just . . . walking by. Heading inside.\u201d I incline my head to the heap on the ground. \u201cHe grabbed me.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI let him.\u201d</p><p>Noah mutters under his breath, something annoyed and unintelligible, and stares at me. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s make like a tree and get out of here.\u201d He grabs the bags I dropped and shakes his head.</p><p>I watch Noah Miles\u2019s broad back as he retreats to our guesthouse\u2019s back entrance. The way he moves tells me he\u2019s waiting on me to follow. Slow, careful, on full alert. One thing I can say about him: When he makes a vow, he damn well means every solemn word of it. A vow to protect me, keep me safe, no matter the cost. This he made to Eli, back in Edinburgh when the very real threat of the Black Fallen killing all of us lingered.</p> <p>\u201cHe knew my name,\u201d I say to Noah\u2019s back as we stand at the door.</p><p>Noah\u2019s shoulders rise and fall, as though he\u2019s taking in a long, exaggerated breath. \u201cThat really doesn\u2019t surprise me, Poe.\u201d He glances back at me. One eyebrow lifts. \u201cAt all.\u201d</p><p>I move ahead of him and through the door. \u201cJust saying.\u201d</p><p>Inside, I find the switch on the wall and flip it on. The light illuminates a small kitchen area. I move to the hallway and flip another switch. It shines on a staircase, and I head up. At the top, I find a corridor with doors. I throw open the first one and hit the light. Big bed. Fireplace. Terrace overlooking Montague Row. I throw my pack onto the fluffy pink duvet and open it, withdrawing a leather case. I open it and stare down at my cache of pointy little weapons.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay on the first floor,\u201d Noah yells up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d I answer absentmindedly. I pull off my leather jacket and toss it on the bed, too, leaving just my black leather vest on. I truly prefer nice soft cotton, but it can\u2019t hold my blades like leather can. Swiftly, I remove and secure on my person multiple silver daggers, knives, dirks. In my vest, the waist of my jeans, front and back. Grasping the lightweight leather holster, I push my shoulder through and secure the strap around my waist. I snug it tight. Then I eye the one remaining weapon I have.</p><p>Right now the most important.</p><p>My scatha.</p><p>What\u2019s that? you ask. Well, in the wise words of the great Inigo Montoya, let me s\u2019plain. From the beginning.</p><p>When I think of who I used to be, it seems as though I\u2019m looking at someone else in an old high school yearbook or old photo album. I barely recognize myself. The line separating my old life and this one is hazy, muddled, and most of the time I don\u2019t know if I want either one of them anymore, if given the choice. I feel icy cold inside now. Ever since Eli\u2019s death.</p><p>In my full-blown human days, I used to be a juvenile delinquent. Then I found my mom murdered, and it set me right. With the help of loving surrogate grandparents, albeit root doctors, I became a successful tattoo artist and businesswoman. I raised my baby brother, Seth, to near adulthood. My business thrived.</p><p>Then the vampires descended upon first my brother, then me. Some vampires good. Some very, very bad.</p><p>One . . . perfect. But he\u2019s gone now. Eli. My fianc\u00e9. He was killed by a Black Fallen\u2014a fallen angel whose soul is darkened by the most evil of magic. My friend Victorian Arcos, a powerful Strigoi vampire, was killed, too, by a Black Fallen. The Fallen were taking over Edinburgh, seeking complete mortal power, and killing a lot of innocents to do it. They sought an ancient book of dark magic, and then, well, WUP got in their way. Eli and Vic especially. God, I\u2019ve never felt so out of control in my life as when those fuckers took Eli and Vic away from me.</p><p>Yet Gawan Conwyk, a thousand-year-old Pictish warrior and swordsman, has given me a shred of hope that maybe, just maybe, they\u2019re not so dead after all. Once an Earthbound angel, Gawan earned his mortality by offering himself as a sacrifice to save a mortal\u2019s life. Not only is he wicked fast and lethal with the blade, but he knows things the rest of us don\u2019t. He knows about Heaven, Hell, and in between. According to his theory, Eli and Victorian might just be suffering in an alternative plane akin to Hell itself. Or purgatory. I\u2019m not sure I believe it just yet. In my heart, I feel emptiness. I don\u2019t feel Eli there anymore. I think I\u2019d feel him inside me, were he still alive. Gawan, though, knows it\u2019s possible. That the Fallen would have thought it more torturous to send them there, to a realm where they have no control, vs. simply killing them. Yet I can\u2019t ignore the emptiness I feel, too.</p><p>I feel . . . nothing. Two hours ago, leaving Edinburgh, I had hope. Where did it go? Even Athios, the wrongly accused Black Fallen who saved me and turned out to be not such a bad guy after all, encouraged me. But I feel a hole inside me. A gaping, lifeless, aching hole. Now that I\u2019ve lost Eli, I only have Seth, my surrogate Gullah grandparents who raised me, Nyx, my friend and coowner of my ink shop, Inksomnia, and, well, Eli\u2019s family. And Noah.</p><p>With so many to love, why do I feel so cold and empty?</p><p>I pick up the scatha. It\u2019s an ancient Pict weapon, fashioned sort of like a combination handgun/crossbow. It has cartridges the size of a ChapStick container filled with mystical holy water from St. Bueno\u2019s Well. Once I\u2019m in that weird, hellish alternative plane of a world, I can obliterate anything that comes near me with it.</p><p>And I have to do it alone.</p><p>I tuck the scatha into the holster, shrug my leather jacket back on, and zip it up to my neck. Just as I turn to head out, I pull up short. Noah\u2019s standing there. Staring.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I meet his silvery gaze. \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s face hardens. \u201cRi, it\u2019s only me and you here. Not the whole team, just us. We have some rogue vampires to take care of, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already took care of one by myself.\u201d I go to move past him. \u201cYour turn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His muscular arm juts out and braces against the doorjamb, catching me right at the throat. I pull up short, and our faces are inches apart, and I stare into his eyes. Before Noah was a vampire, he was a cunning soldier in the Revolutionary War. He may have the most beautifully carved-from-stone face, mesmerizing mercury eyes, and sun-bleached dreadlocks, but Noah is clever as hell. He misses nothing. And when he\u2019s got your back, he\u2019s got it.</p><p>Even when you don\u2019t want him to.</p><p>Which means I gotta do what I gotta do, too.</p> <p>Noah\u2019s pupils dilate just before my thoughts reach his.</p><p>I give a dismal grin. Too late, my friend. Paralysis. I give this command to Noah in my mind. He goes absolutely, rigidly still. Rigor mortis still. His facial muscles freeze. His arm is still braced against the doorjamb. But I know he hears me.</p><p>\u201cI have to try this,\u201d I tell him. His eyes are focused on me, and he might even see me. But he can\u2019t move. Not a solid inch. That\u2019s one tendency I\u2019ve mastered over almost all vampires I come in contact with. Mind control.</p><p>Pisses them all off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking the scatha and going to St. Bueno\u2019s Well,\u201d I tell him. \u201cGawan said the ground\u2019s hallowed there, and old as Heaven and Hell itself. A portal to a place Eli and Vic might be.\u201d I stroke his chin with my forefinger. \u201cHe said I have to go in alone.\u201d I close-mouth kiss him on his lips. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be safe. And back ASAP. Then we\u2019ll kick some more vampire ass. Promise.\u201d</p> <p>I stare into Noah\u2019s eyes for a few seconds longer. I see them flash a bit, darken to stormy gray, and I know inside, he is boiling friggin\u2019 mad as hell. At me for going, and at me for being stronger at mind control than he is. With a final glance, I duck under his arm, jog downstairs, and head out into the night.</p><p>I\u2019m in the narrow close behind the guesthouse, where I\u2019d killed the vampire earlier, and I stop a second. Tying my hair up into a ponytail, I take a deep breath and think. It\u2019s close to eleven p.m. I fish my cell phone from my rear pocket, pull up Google Maps, and check out my route. St. Bueno\u2019s isn\u2019t on any map, and it\u2019s not in any tourist book, either. But Gawan Conwyk of Castle Grimm told me how to get there. And according to the map, I need to highjack some wheels. I could hike it, but, eh. Why bother when I can drive? It would be a pain in the ass to run with all my blades flapping all over the place anyway. Besides, I\u2019m edgy. Anxious to find Eli, or at least a trace of him. I\u2019d probably fall and impale myself.</p><p>I walk out to Montague Row and glance one way, then the other. A dark blue Rover is just pulling up to the curb in front of a guesthouse three homes down. Perfect. I walk over, just as the driver is getting out. A man, midthirties. He leans in and grabs a paper sack of groceries. Mind control time.</p><p>Give me the keys to the Rover. Don\u2019t report it missing, even if it\u2019s gone in the morning. Just call a cab. I\u2019ll bring it back when I\u2019m finished. You won\u2019t even notice me. Nod once if you got all that.</p><p>The guy looks at me but doesn\u2019t really see me. His eyes are kinda glassed over. He nods once, and when I hold my hand out, he drops the keys into my palm.</p><p>Go inside. Forget you\u2019ve seen me tonight. Carry on, my wayward son. There\u2019ll be peace when you are gone.</p> <p>The guy turns and crosses to the front entrance of the stone house. He opens the door and closes it behind him. The interior hall light extinguishes, and I can hear his feet moving up the stairs inside his flat.</p><p>I waste no time jumping into the Rover, starting the engine. Sweet, the Rover has a GPS. I put in the address Gawan Conwyk had given me, and head out. Jake Andorra gave me U.K. driving lessons before leaving Edinburgh. Even though I drive a manual at home, this one\u2019s automatic, and I\u2019m sorta glad. Roads are narrow as hell here. But no sweat. I got this.</p><p>The streets are quiet as I pull out of Montague Row and follow the GPS out of the city. I hit a few roundabouts before I take the A-9, cross over the Beauly Firth, and through dense mist head toward the foot of Ben Wyvis and the small villages of Dingwall and Strathpeffer. According to the GPS, they\u2019re about fifteen miles out of Inverness. I hit the gas and make myself remember to stay to the right. A few random cars pass, their headlights obscured until close proximity because of the heavy Highland mist. Soon, though, I see no one. All shops are closed up for the night. I speed up.</p><p> I\u2019m now weaving through the small village of Strathpeffer. Gawan Conwyk had explained that it had at one time been a Victorian spa town, and that the people of the time had believed the natural spring waters contained magic. Like, life-eternal kind of magic. It is still in existence. Gawan said it wasn\u2019t so much a spa, and that it was more of a place people brought their crazy relatives in hopes of a miracle cure. A huge insane asylum Victorian-era town. Very Stephen King\u2013ish. And the architects of the spa weren\u2019t giving magical therapy. As I drive through the quiet village and notice the tall, dark-stoned Victorian homes set back upon tree-ensconced hills, I can only imagine the creepiness of the times. Ice-water dunkings in the springs, or, nicely put, hydrotherapy. Craniotomies. Whatever. Victorians, Gawan said, were a \u201cweird and morbid lot of folk.\u201d I believe it, and coming from me, that\u2019s sorta hypocritical and funny as shit.</p><p>No sooner have I left the village of Strathpeffer than I see a small white sign with black letters for Dingwall. My British-accented GPS speaker directs me pretty easily, and before long I\u2019m winding through the town center. More narrow streets, stone walls, stone buildings. I pass several stores, a few takeouts, a haggis shop, the police department, and a school. Soon I turn at a car dealership and start up a steep, high hill. At the top, I follow it left, and I\u2019m still climbing a bit as I skirt several small farms. The smell of sheep poop and hay, mixed with whatever that nice herby, clovery smell is of the Highlands, wafts through the vents of the Rover. Too bad this whole trip to Scotland is a WUP mission. Too bad I\u2019m headed into some heinous underworld that I may or may not escape alive from with my fianc\u00e9 and friend. I might actually love it here. There\u2019s something breathtaking and mystical about Scotland. Something unexplainable. A feeling, I guess.</p><p>Ahead, a small dip in the road, then to the right I see a sign: IVY CROFT AND COTTAGE. It\u2019s a narrow paved drive, and I hit the headlights off and turn in. I pass a relatively large two-story house, and at the smaller cottage at the top, I park the Rover and pull the emergency brake. The moment I open the door, the scents assail me. Clover. Floral. Pungent. Perfect. Quietly, I close the car door and scan the shadows. A half-moon hangs over a field, and while it\u2019s not totally dark, the mist makes it hard to see more than fifty feet. According to Gawan\u2019s directions, I have to travel on foot behind the barn I\u2019m standing in front of, up the hill, and after passing a set of ancient standing stones, cross into the wood. I glance behind me, to the house at the foot of the hill. Lights are out, and all is quiet. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be in and out before the family wakes up.</p><p>My hands fly across my body, checking all of the blades holstered onto my person. I double-check the scatha, zip my leather jacket, and with a deep breath, take off behind the barn. I leap over the fence, startling a few dozing sheep. They jump up, bleat, and herd away from me. There is a trail close to the fence, and it slopes up the hill. I start off across the spongy, wet ground. Something tells me I should\u2019ve worn rubber boots vs. my leather ones.</p><p>The half-moon light slips through the mist just enough for me to make out the sheep path I\u2019m running on, and as I climb the hill and leap one metal fence, I see the crooked silhouettes of the standing stones ahead. I\u2019m moving fast, and within seconds I\u2019m beside them. The wind howls, and in the distance, a set of wind chimes dong. A feeling overcomes me, starting at my feet and moving up through my body. It\u2019s like a small jolt of electricity, a low hum vibrating and attaching to every single nerve ending I have. I almost feel nauseated, but . . . not really. I recognize it. It\u2019s holy ground. The ancient, old-as-hell kind of sacred. It\u2019s so strong, so powerful, it\u2019s almost as though whispers emanate from the stones themselves. Way ahead, a hill, or as the Scots call it, a pap. And to the left, a dark, ominous mass of blackness. The wood. According to Gawan, that\u2019s where I need to go. Even without his direction now, I can tell it. The same force that lies beneath my feet and hums through the standing stones beckons from the forest. More whispers. They\u2019re calling my name . . .</p> <p>Bounding over stones, dead clumps of heather, and prickly gorse bushes, I make my way to the shadowy edge of the wood. My whole body is humming now with whatever supernatural power lies within this hallowed ground. I stop, unzip my leather jacket, and grasp the scatha. It\u2019s loaded with six cartridges. I have six more stored in the pockets of my cargos. Hopefully, I won\u2019t have to use them all.</p><p>The moment I cross the wood line, a shift in the air hits me in the gut. No longer guided by Gawan\u2019s directions, but on pure instinct, I take off, leaving the footpath and weaving through the mammoth Scotch pines. Deeper into the forest I move, branches scraping my face, catching my ankles. My insides are seized with pain caused by the hum of supernatural current. It almost doubles me over. It\u2019s like an overdose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I\u2019m close. Close as hell. But I keep pushing, the scatha tightly gripped in my palm.</p><p>The moonlight shifts, and a single beam shines through the canopy of trees ahead. I see it. The entrance to St. Bueno\u2019s Well. I move closer. Slower now. Cautious.</p><p>I feel the sonic boom move through the trees before I see it, and I stiffen and dig my feet into the ground. When the wave hits me, I rock, nearly lose my footing, and teeter for a moment. A raging wind cuts through the trees following the boom, and I\u2019m forced to close my eyes. The wind is so vicious it takes all of my strength to remain upright. My breath catches in my throat. It\u2019s harder to breathe now.</p><p>Then, as fast as it began, it stops.</p><p>Open your eyes. You must move fast.</p><p>My eyes open and my head jerks. I know that voice. It\u2019s Athios, one of the not so willing Black Fallen who basically saved my ass back in Edinburgh. What the hell? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I focus now, and everything changes. The massive Scotch pines crack, split at their bases, and all begin thundering to the ground. There\u2019s nowhere to run as the ancient trees splinter and crash, and I stand rigid, clutching the scatha tightly. I know it\u2019s not real, but it goddamn looks and sounds real. I can even smell fresh exposed pine flesh lingering in the air, as if just chopped for firewood. The scent is so heavy it nearly chokes me. I force my eyes to stay open. They sting and begin to water.</p><p>All at once, the last tree falls. The mist hovers and swirls over the downed forest, obscuring the browns and greens with a white blanket. In the next second, it begins to recede, and in its wake, darkness. It\u2019s almost as if my vision is blurred, and I can\u2019t make out figures, forms, or shapes. I even scrub my eyes with my free fist.</p><p>Then I blink, and my vision sharpens. I\u2019m standing at the end of a street. Dark, shadowy, desolate. No cars. No trash cans. No storefronts. Just a street. At the far end, a derelict church. Ruined stone buildings flank me, along with cracked and torn-up sidewalks. Windows are glassless, and rotted two-by-fours crisscross the gaps. The air around me is dead still, yet some of the windows have tattered drapes that flap in a breeze that doesn\u2019t exist. My eyes search every angle, every sharp edge, every shadow. I glance down, and at my feet, see a dead raven. Half of it\u2019s smashed into the broken pavement, its wings unnaturally bent backward. The eyes have been burned out. Nothing but a singed hole looks up at me.</p> <p>I step over the dead raven, and it begins to flap its broken wings. Billy Squier\u2019s \u201cThe Stroke\u201d starts booming from one of the broken windows above me. My eyes scan the gaping holes, and I see nothing. I take a long breath and move forward. I can\u2019t let this world get to me. Besides, I love Billy Squier. What the hell?</p><p>No sooner do I move five feet than my heart seizes. I feel it thump, heavy, like a chunk of lead, and my first and immediate thought is Eli. My eyes latch onto the church at the end of the street. He\u2019s in there. I know it. I feel it.</p><p>My legs react before my brain does, and I start to run. Only then do the cracks in the sidewalk break wider, and distorted, shadowy shrouds writhe out of them and move toward me. Their screams pierce my ears, and I feel like my eardrums will explode. The figures emerge from the cracks and take new forms and charge me. One has a shrunken cat\u2019s head on a long, willowy body and long, jagged fangs. It hurls itself at me, and I point my scatha directly at its head and fire off one cartridge. The body drops in midair. The head is obliterated. Another one from the left lunges, and I fire. It drops, too. I\u2019m closer to the church. Closer to Eli. I feel him there. Waiting for me.</p><p>I\u2019m hit from behind and taken to the ground. Something sharp, cold, jabs into my back and straight through to the pavement beneath me. The pain is white-hot, almost blinding me. I gather all of my strength and explode upward, the thing still attached to my back. I flip, my back facing the ground, and we crash down. Quickly I roll, jump, and fire the scatha. Obliterated. I don\u2019t bother looking around me. I take off. The church is ahead, maybe fifty feet. One of the double doors is caved in. The stone is charred, as though it\u2019s been burned. The screams of the shadow creatures surround me, calling my name in such deafening tones I think I\u2019ll lose my fucking mind. I push it all aside and speed up. With the dark shrouds all around me, with their little shrunken cat heads and distorted bodies grabbing for me, I leap the last fifteen feet in midair and crash through the double doors. One roll and I land in a crouch. The cat heads stop screaming my name. Even Billy Squier quiets. All is silent for a few seconds, and I search the inside of the decaying remains of the kirk. It smells like rotting flesh, death, and moldy wood. A creaking sound above me makes me look up. My heart crams into my throat. My body is paralyzed. My mouth moves, but no sound comes out. Eli! Vic! I say in my mind. No answer.</p><p>My vampire fianc\u00e9, Eligius Dupr\u00e9, and vampire friend and WUP team member Victorian Arcos are hanging from the rotted rafters above. Tied at the wrists, they\u2019re both completely naked. Their pale bodies are so covered by scorched whip marks that the stark slashes make it nearly impossible to tell their limbs apart. Some of the slashes are gaping. Made by blades. Holy hell . . .</p> <p>The moment I decide to move, the sound of beating wings makes me pause. From a rafter close to Eli, a giant black gargoyle sweeps toward me. Its screaming talons and fangs are aimed for my head. I drop to my knee and fire the scatha, and the moment the cartridge hits, its body flies backward and crashes against the derelict stone wall. Black ashes fall to the floor.</p><p>Another one comes at me, from Victorian\u2019s side, and it\u2019s close, moving fast, and I have to free-run over broken pews and crumbling stone to get a good shot at it. I leap, half twist, and aim the scatha at the screaming thing. The cartridge knocks it back, too, and turns the creature to ashes. I\u2019ve got eight cartridges left, and I\u2019ll need every one of them to get us all out of here. I waste no time free-running, leaping off whatever solid thing my feet can find hold of, to reach the rafters above. I reach Eli first.</p><p>Hanging by one hand, I have no choice but to holster my scatha. I do so quickly, and gently grasp Eli\u2019s jaw with my now-free hand. \u201cEli?\u201d I say, and my vision is blurred by the tears that are filling my eyes. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m looking at his face. His live face. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see him again. \u201cEli! Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>A low groan emits from his throat, and that\u2019s all I need. All in one motion, I wrap my legs around his waist, grab a blade from the back of my jeans, and cut the rope binding his wrists to the rafter. We start to fall, and I notice his body is colder than usual. We drop twenty feet to the floor, and I swing under him just before we hit, landing on my feet. He\u2019s heavy as hell, but I\u2019ve got him. I crouch with him and lay his head gently down, his dark hair falling over his still-closed eyes. But he\u2019s alive. My love is alive!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back and we\u2019ll get the hell out of here,\u201d I whisper to him, and graze his lips with a kiss. They\u2019re cold, too, and I shake the chill off and gather my strength. Finding a foothold on an overturned pew, I free-run up the wall and leap over to Victorian. Mimicking my movements from before, I wrap my legs around Vic\u2019s naked body.</p><p>\u201cArcos? Can you hear me?\u201d I say close to his ear.</p> <p>A faint grunt comes from deep within him. Again, that\u2019s all I need for now.</p><p>Letting go of the rafter with one hand, I hold Vic tightly, and with one swipe, I cut through his binds with my blade. We fall, and I land, laying him beside Eli. God Almighty, they\u2019re both covered in cuts and slashes. No blood, just dark, sooty marks on every limb, their faces, their chests, almost as if burned with some fiery weapon. Although their flesh is bloodless, it\u2019s filleted open in places. What the hell happened to them?</p><p>The sound of beating wings begins, inaudible whispers colliding, but I know what they\u2019re saying. Riley . . .</p><p>Time to get out. Now.</p><p>I\u2019ve got no alternative but to drag Eli and Vic out by their bound wrists.</p><p>A loud beating of wings erupts from outside, and I know when I, dragging two six-foot-plus, hundred-and-eighty-pound naked vampires, explode through what once was the doorway of the church, I will have to have one free hand to fire the scatha. Quickly, I check the bindings on Eli\u2019s and Vic\u2019s wrists, and I cringe at what the paved cracked street will do to their flesh. But I can\u2019t help it. I have to have a free firing arm.</p><p>With the screams filling the church, I load the scatha\u2019s ammo chamber with four more cartridges, making it completely full. I then take the long piece of rope hanging from Eli\u2019s bound wrists, and the one from Vic\u2019s, and grasp them in my left hand, then wrap it around several times until they\u2019re snug together. With the scatha gripped in my palm, forefinger on the trigger, I take a deep breath and, using all of my strength, run full force at the doorway. The guys are heavy as mother hell, but we\u2019re moving fast. The moment we clear the kirk, there are tiny-headed, fanged cat creatures all over the street. They\u2019re still as death, just staring at me with vertical pupils, and three lunge at once. I rapid-fire three rounds off, and three headless creatures fall to the ground. I take off, ignoring the groans I hear coming from both Eli and Vic. I have no idea what kind of condition they\u2019re in. I don\u2019t care. They\u2019re alive and that\u2019s all the info I need for now. I just need to get us the fuck out of here.</p><p>The street seems to have grown longer, and I don\u2019t know what to do except keep running toward the end of it, away from the kirk. There are more shrouded creatures writhing up from the sidewalk cracks\u2014too many for the number of cartridges I have left. I keep running, only firing at the ones who get too close. My arm feels like it\u2019s being torn off, and I glance back to make sure both Eli and Vic are still there. A cat creature has landed on Eli\u2019s back and is gnawing on his ribs. I stop, drop to one knee, and fire the scatha, blowing it off Eli. Quickly, I load the remaining cartridges. I have three more left.</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>Frustration clouds my judgment. What the hell do I do? I run toward the end of the street, but it stretches out long before me, like it\u2019s never going to end, and distorted shadows grab at me, folding the darkness in on me. It\u2019s now pitch-black, and I can only see the glowing eyes of the creatures hiding, preying, stalking us. I keep running, Eli\u2019s and Vic\u2019s bodies bounding limply behind me. They are heavy as shit, too. Like a ton of bricks. I fire another shot at something that flies at me from the shadows. Sparks flutter. I haul ass. One more cartridge left.</p><p>Then darkness settles at the end of the street. A pitch cloud, clustering together. First one pine tree, then another emerges. The woods! The goddamn woods! I draw every ounce of speed and strength I have and make my way there. One more creature leaps out at me, and I fire just before it knocks into me. I\u2019m out of ammo. Almost there . . .</p><p>The moment my feet hit the spongy forest floor, that sonic boom wave flashes through the pines and knocks me backward. The rope entwining my wrist to Eli\u2019s and Vic\u2019s breaks, we all separate, and I fly hard through the air until a tree trunk stops my body. My shoulder pops, and I fall to the ground. Shaking my head, I try to stand, fall back down, stand again. Everything looks blurry, and my knees feel like rubber, and the pain in my shoulder screams as I lift my free hand to my eyes and scrub them. My other hand still grips tightly the scatha. I shake my head again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something\u2019s wrong.</p><p>My frantic eyes search the forest floor.</p><p>Eli and Vic are gone.</p> <p>A cold, sick wave of nausea sweeps over me, and I run, fall, get up, and run some more.

Where the hell did they go?</p><p>I sink to the ground. I can\u2019t catch my breath, almost like I\u2019m hyperventilating. I try to inhale deeply, and I can\u2019t.

And I can feel it\u2014something ain\u2019t right. It\u2019s a sense that makes my stomach hurt. Like something\u2019s coming and this time, she won\u2019t be able to stop it. That\u2019s the thing about Riley. She always thinks she\u2019s got everything under control, no matter what it is. Drugs. Bully cops. Gangs. Vampires. Well, I\u2019m not a kid anymore. And I won\u2019t let her fall alone.</p><p>\u2014Seth Poe</p><p>My body jerks. My eyes fly open. Everything\u2019s dark. The air is sickening, still.</p><p>Eli. Vic. With a burst of energy I leap to my feet. Instinct makes me grab my left arm. Pain singes the shoulder joint. Where the hell is my scatha? I scan the ground. It\u2019s nowhere.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter. I have to go back in. . . .</p><p>My feet move first, and after two steps I\u2019m snatched to a halt. Pain shoots from my shoulder and I hiss.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d a raspy voice says to me. A vise squeezes my good arm.</p><p>Dazed, I turn to my captor. Dreads. Crooked smile.</p><p>My partner. \u201cLet me go, Noah,\u201d I say evenly. My eyes are locked with his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it, girl,\u201d he says, and pulls me close. \u201cThis time, that mind shit won\u2019t work.\u201d From his fingers dangles the leather cord he wears around his neck, with a sachet of herbs concocted by my surrogate root doctor grandfather. It keeps his intoxicating sensual vampire scent, irrefutable by any and all species, at bay. He throws it over his head, away from the both of us. It lands at least twenty feet away. My eyes widen.</p><p>I feel my pupils dilate, and my body relaxes. I fixate on Noah\u2019s lips. Full. Curved at the corners. Sexy as hell. Inviting. I gotta taste them. . . .</p><p>My body\u2019s hot now, flashes of sensory fire scattering all over my flesh in patches. Stomach. Neck. Thighs. Crotch. Nothing makes sense to me except getting as physically close to Noah Miles as possible. I have to have him. Both of my hands reach for Noah\u2019s head, he dips back, and all I touch are a few dreads. That\u2019ll do. Wrapping my fingers tightly around them, I yank his head toward my mouth. At the same time, I leap onto him, curling my legs around his waist. One of his large hands separates us, and it\u2019s pressing against my chest, pushing me away. My eyes dilate wider. I lean toward him, mouth open, the pain in my left shoulder forgotten. . . .</p><p>\u201cWhoa, my little horny toad, take it easy,\u201d Noah commands, and pushes me off his body. He chuckles, and the sound excites me. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell you about this later,\u201d he says. He scoops me up in his arms. Runs. Picks something up. \u201cDamn, Poe,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>I\u2019m barely hearing him, so deafening is my heartbeat roaring within me. Pounding in my groin. Sex. That\u2019s all I want from Noah Miles. Sex. Now. With my good hand I grab a fistful of dreads and yank his head toward me. His mouth, so close, my teeth nip at his jaw. I want his tongue. . . .</p><p>A flash of light goes off in my face, but I don\u2019t care. It could be a pair of headlights on a truck barreling at me full speed for all I care. As long as I get these goddamn clothes off. . . .</p><p>\u201cRiley, damn it,\u201d Noah mutters, and his hand stills mine as I find his crotch.</p><p>I feel as though I\u2019m flying through the air, Noah carrying me, and I have not a care in the world except crawling as close to him as I physically can. The wind pushes at my face, and I bury it against his neck. I kiss him there, taking small nips, licks, and I find his earlobe with the silver stud he wears. I pull it into my mouth and groan.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ Almighty, girl,\u201d Noah groans, and pulls his head away. \u201cRiley, give me a break, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re moving so fast I can\u2019t make my legs creep up his body any higher. I\u2019m nearly out of my mind with lust, the scent of Noah an addicting drug. He keeps pushing me away, and it\u2019s pissing me the fuck off. \u201cPlease,\u201d I beg.</p><p>The next instant happens so fast my head spins. I\u2019m flung onto a leather seat, my right wrist is tied to the leather door pull, and I\u2019m crammed inside, door shut. My brain is fuzzy. I feel light-headed. Dizzy. The pain in my left shoulder begins to throb.</p><p>The driver\u2019s-side door opens, closes. I shake my head and look up. Noah\u2019s staring at me, his eyebrows lifted in amusement. One corner of his mouth is tilted upward. Yet a pained look lingers in his eyes.</p><p>He cocks his head. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head again. The fog is clearing, and I glance around. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peering through the Rover\u2019s windshield, I notice I\u2019m back at the cottage. I turn my stare on Noah. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go back\u2014\u201d I move to open the Rover\u2019s door, but my hand is tied. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go back, darlin\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re out of ammo. You\u2019ll get yourself killed. There\u2019s nothing more you can do.\u201d</p><p>I try to lift my left hand to untie my right, and pain shoots through me. \u201cSon of a bitch . . .\u201d I look at my shoulder. It\u2019s hanging lower than it should. \u201cYou gonna help me with this, Miles?\u201d</p><p>Noah shakes his head, starts up the motor, and puts the Rover in reverse. \u201cHell no,\u201d he replies. \u201cNot until you calm down.\u201d</p><p>Anger boils inside me, and my eyes dart to his neck. His antisexual attraction sachet is hanging there. I know exactly what happened. I lift a furious gaze at Noah. \u201cYou actually used that on me?\u201d It\u2019s getting light now, and I see more than just the shadow of Noah\u2019s face.</p><p>He smirks. \u201cHad no choice. You were being stubborn.\u201d He stops, puts the Rover in drive, and we start down the lane. I glance across the field and notice a man walking toward us with long, purposeful strides. A black-and-white sheepdog jogs at his side. He lifts his hand, and Noah stops.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you two this mornin\u2019?\u201d he asks. His eyes light on my shoulder.</p><p>He\u2019s a handsome guy, great accent, late thirties, early forties. The slightest touch of silver tinges his temples. Hazel eyes. Broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAh, no, we were just out for a hike,\u201d Noah explains. \u201cNice standing stones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, yeah,\u201d the man says. \u201cThousand years old or better, those.\u201d He glances at me again briefly. I can tell he sees something\u2019s not right. I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, I best get to my chores. Enjoy your day,\u201d the man says, then turns and finds his dog chasing the sheep in the field. \u201cOch, Shep, you wicked dog. Get back here!\u201d He grins and waves, and Noah continues on.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d Noah asks. \u201cI know you went in after Eli and Arcos.\u201d He shoots me a mercurial glare. \u201cWhat you did to me at the guesthouse? Shitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me with a dislocated shoulder,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cJust until we get back to the flat,\u201d Noah says.</p><p>I tell him what happened back in . . . wherever in Hell that place was. \u201cWeird, lanky shadow bodies with tiny cat heads and sharp fangs and claws. Gargoylish-things guarding Eli and Vic in that old church, and Eli and Vic were suspended by their wrists, and naked, from the rafters.\u201d I look at Noah, and I\u2019m not mad at him anymore. I know whatever he does, he does to protect me. That vow he promised to uphold to Eli? I have a feeling it\u2019s going to interfere. A lot. \u201cNoah, they were both alive. They groaned. I dragged them all the way out of that hellhole by their wrists.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a sideways glance. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cOnce we hit the forest, I don\u2019t know . . . the same kind of sonic boom swept over us. Knocked my ass at least twenty, thirty feet through the air. Broke the rope I had bound all three of us together with.\u201d I try to lift my shoulder. No go. \u201cI hit the tree, tried to get up, fell, tried again. And again.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThey just . . . disappeared.\u201d I look at my partner. \u201cBut they were both alive. Swear to God they were.\u201d</p><p>At the foot of the long steep hill leading away from Ivy Cottage and St. Bueno\u2019s, Noah puts the Rover in park. He half turns in his seat and looks at me. \u201cI believe you. We\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d Lightning fast, he reaches over my body, places his large hand on my left shoulder, and snaps it back into place. I suck in a quick breath of pain; then it\u2019s over. With a much more tender touch, he grazes my chin. \u201cNext time, trust me, okay? Don\u2019t use your mind power on me again, Riley. I want Eli as alive as you do.\u201d He then unties my right wrist, puts the Rover in drive; we head back through Dingwall, Strathpeffer, and before long we\u2019re on the A-9.</p><p>We are both silent for several miles, and I try to take in, then shake off, everything that\u2019s happened to me since arriving in Inverness. For the first time, I feel lost. Before, I had direction. I had loaded cartridges for the scatha. I had a plan.</p><p>To save Eli and Vic.</p><p>Now that\u2019s all blown to hell.</p><p>Where did they go? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have work to do, Ri,\u201d Noah says, staring forward. The bridge over the Beauly Firth looms ahead, and the heavy scent of sea life seeps through the vents of the Rover. \u201cGet your head in the game.\u201d</p><p>We are in the middle of the bridge when my cell phone rings from the center console. Immediately, my heart jerks in my chest.</p><p>It\u2019s AC/DC\u2019s \u201cHighway to Hell.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s Victorian Arcos\u2019s ring tone.</p><p>Throwing open the console, I grab my iPhone and answer, \u201cVictorian?\u201d</p><p>There is nothing but silence for more seconds than I can almost stand.</p><p>\u201cRiley? Is it you?\u201d Vic says. His voice is hoarse, quieter than usual. But it\u2019s him.</p><p>I can barely speak. \u201cWhere are you? Are you okay? What happened to you back\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Victorian lets out a low, weak laugh. \u201cI thought you said you could barely speak, love.\u201d</p><p>I lean against the headrest of my seat and close my eyes. \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re alive.\u201d I sit straight up. I feel sweat pop out at my forehead, and my breath catches in my throat. \u201cIs Eli with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNu, dragostea mea,\u201d Vic answers in his native Romanian. No, my love. \u201cWhat happened to me? How did I get home?\u201d he asks.</p><p>From the corner of my eye I see Noah mutter into his cell phone. He\u2019s calling the States. Eli\u2019s family.</p><p>\u201cHome? As in Romania?\u201d I continue, but my mind is screaming, Where the hell is Eli?</p><p>\u201cDa, Romania. And I know you wish to hear more of your fianc\u00e9, Riley,\u201d he says in a low voice. \u201cI can still hear your thoughts, love, and I wish I had more to offer. I . . . just don\u2019t remember much at all. Except . . . pain. Excruciating pain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Vic,\u201d I say, yet my skin prickles at the thought. I don\u2019t want to sound cold, but hell yeah, I want to know more of Eli. \u201cDo you remember being in the church with Eli? Me dragging you through the streets? The forest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in the church with Eli. It happened almost as instantaneously as I appeared back home. In . . . a flash.\u201d He sighs into the receiver. \u201cWe were strung up by our wrists. Beaten with . . . something not natural. We don\u2019t bleed, Riley. But yet . . . it drained us. Then the beatings simply stopped. And we hung. We spoke until neither of us could speak any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaten by who? And why?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Vic sighs into the phone. \u201cI never saw a face, only shadow. But I got the same sense I had when Jake Andorra hit me with his sword. I think it was one of the Fallen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the beatings stopped because the Fallen were killed,\u201d I offer. \u201cWhy, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue, other than pure torture brought pleasure to them,\u201d he says. \u201cOr to bring pain to you, which seems more likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was a success,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve been out of my fucking mind, Victorian. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warm body, wrapped around mine\u2014I pray that it was yours. A fall. More pain, I think I was being dragged down the street. Something . . . knocked me hard. Had I breath within me, it would have been gone. A strange language I didn\u2019t understand, muttering something unintelligible. Then . . . nothing. I woke up here, with my papa staring down at me. Who\u2019s with you? Miles? I\u2019ll join you two\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSlow down, Arcos, and no, you won\u2019t,\u201d I insist. \u201cI\u2019ve got to call Jake and let him know about this. He\u2019s got to be told. You stay away from here, Vic. For now. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Silence on the other end.</p><p>\u201cVictorian. I. Mean. It.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d he agrees. \u201cBut only because you ask it. Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Vic,\u201d I respond.</p><p>\u201cStay close to Miles. Do not try stupid things alone. And I will come right away, if you desire. All you have to do is ask.\u201d</p><p>I exhale. \u201cI know you will. Thanks. I\u2019ll be in touch. And hey,\u201d I say quickly, before he ends the call.</p><p>\u201cDa?\u201d Yes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>Victorian softly chuckles. \u201cI haven\u2019t been that, love, in centuries. But I know what you mean. I am glad, also. Thank you. I know \u2019twas you who saved me, even if I couldn\u2019t see your face.\u201d</p><p>We end the call, and I glance at Noah.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI spoke with Gilles. Eli isn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>My heart drops to my stomach. \u201cHow can that be? How does Victorian go from a forest in Scotland to Romania in a blink, but no sign of Eli?\u201d My eyes search the gray waters of the Beauly Firth. Cars are on the road now, people in their ordinary lives going about their ordinary business. Shoppers. Tourists. Locals. Fishermen. Suits.</p><p>Yet there is a true Hell, right here on Earth. And none of them even know it.</p><p>Noah\u2019s cell rings, and my heart leaps as I look at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jake,\u201d he says. \u201cAndorra,\u201d Noah answers the phone. \u201cOkay, hold.\u201d He pushes something, and Jake\u2019s voice booms out of the speaker.</p><p>\u201cRiley, are you hurt?\u201d Jake asks. His unusual accent is something I\u2019m finally used to. A mixture of Scots brogue and something indefinable. Something ancient.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer. \u201cJake, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d he says.</p><p>So I do. I give him full details of everything, starting with me arriving at Ivy Cottage, my trek up to the stones, then the woods and St. Bueno\u2019s. Everything from the moment I entered that alternative world filled with weird tiny cat-headed demons, to pulling Eli and Vic out of the rafters. I end with the sonic boom that separated us all, and then I tell him of Vic\u2019s phone call from Romania.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that was Arcos on the phone?\u201d Jake asks.</p><p>The question catches me so off guard words fail me.</p><p>\u201cRiley, I took his head myself,\u201d Jake reminds me. \u201cYou saw it happen.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo way is it not him, Jake. I refuse to believe it.\u201d I glance at Noah, and he\u2019s looking ahead in traffic and pulls onto Montague Row. \u201cNo freaking way. Besides, Jake. I saw your sword flash, and then Victorian disappear. So I can\u2019t vouch for the beheading. I mean, it looked like you\u2019d done it. But I don\u2019t know. Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call his father,\u201d Jake says. \u201cYou two get your heads in the game and wrap up Inverness. We need you here. Fucking wolves.\u201d</p><p>The line goes dead. Just like Jake Andorra. Business finished, hang up.</p><p>Meanwhile, all I can think about is Eli. He\u2019s got to be alive.</p><p>And I don\u2019t care if it kills me, I\u2019ll find him.</p><p>When Noah parks the Rover, the owner is standing on the sidewalk, briefcase in hand. Poor guy. I hope he doesn\u2019t get canned because he\u2019s late to work. We hop out, I holster my scatha, and Noah leaves the Rover\u2019s engine running.</p><p>\u201cHey, nice ride,\u201d Noah says to the guy. His eyes are glassed over, but he nods.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he answers, and focuses on his car. He scratches his forehead, confused.</p><p>\u201cHave a nice day,\u201d I add.</p><p>The guy walks to the driver\u2019s-side door, still open. \u201cRight, then,\u201d he says. \u201cCheers.\u201d Then he climbs in and takes off down the street.</p><p>I glance up, toward the sky. There\u2019s no sun out, but it\u2019s daylight. A dull gray haze surrounds the city. Car horns, voices, doors opening and closing, dogs barking. All the sounds collide at once, and I force myself not to cover my ears like a little kid. Suddenly, I\u2019m drained, no energy, and all I want to do is close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn, I know that look,\u201d Noah says, and grabs my arm. He pulls me to the guesthouse posing as our hideout. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Sleeping Beauty, before you make a bed on the sidewalk.\u201d</p><p>I can sometimes go days without sleep now, but when it hits, it\u2019s narcoleptic hell. It\u2019s coming over me now, a wash of weary indescribable, almost as if I\u2019ve had a long day at the beach in ninety-degree breezes and salty waves. Just . . . exhausting. I feel my feet leave the ground, and my nose scrapes Noah\u2019s neck. He chuckles, mutters something. He\u2019s carrying me, putting me down. My body\u2019s against something soft, smells nice. Everything\u2019s dark now, all is silent, and I\u2019m going out. . . .</p><p>The river. Brine. Marsh grass. Not the river Ness. Home. I inhale deeply, until the air singes my lungs. The blow of a porpoise in the harbor hisses through the night air.</p><p>My eyes flutter open, and I\u2019m in my bedroom, upstairs from my shop. Inksomnia. Seems like it\u2019s been forever since I\u2019ve been home. Everything\u2019s hazy, and I scrub my eyes to clear my vision. The French doors leading out to the small balcony are open, and the gauzy drapes are fluttering in a barely there breeze. I can feel it on my face, my bare arms, and with it carries the scent of something other than brine. . . .</p><p>Rising from my bed, I glance down at my body. A sheer champagne-silk slip clings to my skin, grazes my breasts, and the material shifts with the sea breeze. It barely covers my thighs. My long straight hair falls over one shoulder, and I push it back. The wooden floor is cool beneath my bare feet as I make my way to the open door. I pause and place my palm against the wooden French frame. The lights glow an amber hue against the aged cobbles of River Street below, and the sound of the river washing against the marshy shore on the opposite bank lulls me into a calming trance. I inhale again, and close my eyes. . . .</p><p>I sense him before I feel him, and when he moves behind me, my body reacts, a thousand nerve endings snapping fire at once. His hand skims my arm, over my hip, my thigh. With his other hand, he pushes back my hair and exposes my neck. Soft, firm lips drag with erotic, painful slowness across my skin, lingering on my shoulder. His scent, so familiar, makes my heart slam against my ribs with anticipation. My joints weaken at the knees. I\u2019d know his touch, the feel of his mouth against me, anywhere. He\u2019s mine. He\u2019s back. . . .</p><p>Eli. . . .</p><p>He turns me in his arms, and grasps my face with both hands. My fingers find his chest bare, and my eyes drink him in. I never thought I\u2019d see him again, and a feeling greater than joy seizes my heart. My lips part to speak, but he hushes me with one finger across my mouth, silencing me. Slowly, he shakes his head, and I swallow whatever crazy words I had. I don\u2019t want to break this spell. Is it really happening? Is he really here, under my touch? Am I really looking into the face that I love? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A hank of pitch-dark hair falls over one of his trademark cerulean Dupr\u00e9 eyes, and he searches my face as though seeking some fine, minor detail he\u2019d earlier missed. I allow him this, but impatience is biting at me. I want him, his lips, his tongue\u2014I\u2019d crawl into his skin if I could. I can\u2019t get close enough. And I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can wait, but I let him take his time. Slowly, he explores every small detail. I\u2019m dying. . . .</p><p>Tilting my head to the right, he lowers his head toward me. Something flashes in his eyes, just a fraction of a spark, just before his lips, those sensual, full, erotic lips, graze mine. And I\u2019m lost. . . .</p><p>His hand cups the back of my head as he leans into the kiss, and he leaves nothing unloved. His mouth caresses mine, at first, gentle, searching, testing. Then he tastes me, and as if a firecracker has exploded, his free hand presses against the small of my back and yanks me against him, and my arms slip around his neck, entwine through his hair. I kiss him back with fervor, and when his hand lowers to my backside, he pulls me harder to him. A rock-hard bulge is between us, pressing against me, and I can\u2019t stop the smile on my mouth that he\u2019s kissing right now. My hands drop from his hair, my fingertips trailing over his chest, and I find his waistband. Undoing one button, then two, then three, I feel Eli\u2019s kiss deepening as my palm finds the erection straining against his jeans. I release him, and the feel of him is so familiar, so right, I can\u2019t help the vulnerable groan that escapes me. Eli catches me behind my knees and picks me up, our lips never parting, and carries me to my bed. We fall together, and he stretches over me. Then he breaks our kiss and looks at me through his fall of lush black hair. His face is half cast in shadow, and it\u2019s nothing but a straight-up turn-on. He studies me long, hard, and I writhe with anticipation beneath him. Bracing his weight with one arm, he caresses my face with one knuckle, drags it across my lips, then down the column of my throat. Neither of us breathes a word. I\u2019m afraid to. I don\u2019t want this to not be real. . . .</p> <p>\u201cDo it now, Eli,\u201d a strange female voice echoes from the shadows.</p><p>Eli goes totally still above me. Who the hell\u2019s voice is that? Eli\u2019s strength radiates through his body, making him quiver.</p><p>\u201cDo not make me say it again,\u201d the female voice commands. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>A single headlight beam flashes across the interior of my room, and illuminates Eli\u2019s face for one half split second. But I see it. I see it clearly. I see him clearly.</p><p>His face and body are marred by singed slashes. His jaw is extended, a row of sharp teeth dropped to jagged points. His eyes are . . . black as pitch.</p> <p>He knows I know. He grabs my throat with his free hand and jerks his face to mine. I scream. Grab his hair from the back and yank his head away. I flip him, now straddling him. He screams, his head rolling side to side so fast it blurs. And it\u2019s a bloodcurdling sound I\u2019ve never heard before. I scream, too. . . .</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m flipped onto my back, and the harsh impact of my shoulder blades on the floor makes my breath wheeze out. A sharp slap against my cheek burns and makes my foggy vision begin to clear. The light from a swag lamp above me makes me squint. I see clearly now. Noah is on top of me, holding me down.</p><p>\u201cAre you back?\u201d he asks. His voice is raspy, tinged with concern.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer. \u201cGet off me.\u201d I give Noah a shove. He jumps up and extends a hand. I take it, and he pulls me up. I\u2019m groggy, as though I\u2019ve been sleeping for days. With the pads of my fingertips, I rub my eyes.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-eight hours to be exact,\u201d Noah says. Never does he miss an opportunity to read my mind. I\u2019m most vulnerable when I just awaken from one of my fallout sleeps. Jesus, twenty-eight hours. Wasted. \u201cAnd a lot\u2019s happened since you passed out.\u201d</p> <p>I look at him. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Noah shakes his head. \u201cFirst, what\u2019d you see?\u201d</p><p>I notice that I\u2019m still fully dressed, minus the leather jacket and boots. We\u2019re standing in the small living room, finished in blue-and-black plaid. I walk toward what I hope is the kitchen, find the fridge, and thankfully, Noah\u2019s bought a gallon of milk. I twist off the plastic cap and raise the jug to my mouth. Ice-cold whole milk pours down my throat, and I\u2019m a half gallon down by the time I pull it away.</p><p>\u201cI was with Eli, back home,\u201d I begin after wiping my mouth with the back of my hand. \u201cHe was . . . perfect. Unmarred.\u201d I shrug. \u201cHe was my Eli. Then he changed. His skin was slashed with those blackened singe marks, like he had in the church when I pulled him out. He morphed, full-vamp changed on me.\u201d I meet Noah\u2019s gaze. \u201cSomeone commanded him to hurt me. A female. After that, he did try to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a dream, Riley,\u201d Noah says. \u201cNothing more.\u201d</p><p>I take another gulp of milk, screw the lid back on, and put it back in the fridge. Turning, I lean against the counter and cross my arms over my chest. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s alive, Noah. Vic\u2019s alive. He somehow zapped clear over to Romania once I cleared him of that alternative world. Eli is . . . somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Noah asks. \u201cAny clue who the female is?\u201d</p><p>I press my fingertips to my temples and rub hard. Woke up too fast. Head is splitting. \u201cHell if I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you think he put that dream in your head?\u201d</p><p>My eyes flash open and I stare at my partner. My friend, too. Noah Miles would lay down his immortal life for me. Without a doubt, he would. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anyone or anything that could stop him. And that\u2019s a little frightening. \u201cOr the female. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s face tenses, and I can tell my words trouble him. Troubles me, too. \u201cLet\u2019s get Inverness handled,\u201d he says, turns me around, and takes over rubbing my temples. So easily, he could squash straight through my skull and into my brain. But he won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really, truly gross and disgusting,\u201d he says, and turns me back around to face him. \u201cBut it\u2019s nice you trust me.\u201d He gives me a somber look. \u201cWe\u2019ll get all this figured out,\u201d he says. Surprisingly, I\u2019m comforted by that. \u201cUntil then, we\u2019ve got work to do. You\u2019ve taken one rogue out. I\u2019ve taken another two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo?\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they seem to be unrelated, and both newbloods. One of them crazy and big as shit,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cNo pattern with their targets, except all hits at night.\u201d He eyes me. \u201cCould be an older one transformed a handful of newbloods, and they\u2019ve all just struck out on their own. Like I said, no pattern to their kills, and they\u2019ve all been alone. We\u2019ll have to hunt like hell until we get them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to split up,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cNot happening,\u201d Noah says. \u201cNo way in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo choice,\u201d I say. \u201cBesides, do you realize I can hear your footfall from a mile away? I can call your name and you\u2019re at my side within seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot seconds,\u201d he counters. \u201cOnly if I\u2019m close enough is it seconds. Might take a few minutes if we\u2019re on opposite ends of the city. And that might be a few minutes too long.\u201d He shakes his head, one long dread falling from the clip he has gathered at the nape of his neck. \u201cNo way, Riley. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hunt together tonight,\u201d I offer. Besides, I can tell nothing will change Noah\u2019s mind right now. No sense in wasting time arguing when there\u2019s work to be done. \u201cThe city\u2019s not too big. Let\u2019s just get tonight over with, see what we find, and go from there.\u201d It is a little hard being all WUP business, when all that\u2019s on my mind is Eli, where he is, the condition he\u2019s in, and how in hell he put that dream into my head.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Noah agrees, but his dark blond eyebrows are furrowed into a frown. Those silvery eyes hold mine. \u201cThere\u2019s takeout in the fridge. Unless you\u2019re good to go on all that milk you guzzled.\u201d</p><p>I grab the fridge door, open it, push past my partner\u2019s specially bagged blood products, and find the white foam container of . . . whatever. I grab it and carry it to the microwave. After it heats, I sit down at the kitchen table and Noah watches me closely as I devour two slabs of batter-fried haddock, a pile of thick chips, and a beef pie. At least, I think it was a beef pie. It all went down so fast I barely tasted the glob of brown sauce and malt vinegar Noah had covered the chips in.</p><p>Like my narcoleptic hell, the appetite I wake up to is something uncontrolled, and pretty impressive for a girl. I guess it\u2019s my body\u2019s way of keeping me in good functioning condition. I honestly can\u2019t help it. But my thoughts remain on Eli. Always.</p><p>I rise and toss my empty container in the trash, down a warm soda, and throw it away, too. I glance at Noah.</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes,\u201d I say. \u201cI need to shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d he agrees. \u201cI threw your bag in the first room.\u201d</p><p>I leave the kitchen without another word, hurry to the first guest room, and toss my duffel onto the bed. Riffling through what small amount of belongings I packed, I pull out a clean pair of black skinny jeans, a long-sleeved black Under Armour shirt, panties and socks, and a clean sports bra. Grabbing the smaller bag containing bathroom stuff, I head to the room\u2019s en suite bath. Within seconds I\u2019m stripped and standing beneath a steaming waterfall. Soapy water runs down my body, my arms, and for a moment, I stare at the dragon\u2019s tail that\u2019s wrapped around one of them. I skim my hand over it, remembering the day my best friend, Nyx, inked it there. Starting at my lower spine, the dragon winds up and over my shoulder. The tail curls around my index finger. It was the last part to be colored in. Hurt like a mother, right there over my bony knuckle. And it seems so long ago. A whole life ago.</p><p>Rinsing the conditioner from my hair, I turn the water off, wrap my hair in a towel, and climb out. Just as I turn my head to close the shower door, the window catches my eye in the mirror. A face. My heart stops. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I whip around and stare at the window.</p><p>Nothing\u2019s there.</p><p>There\u2019s a ledge above the toilet, just beneath the window. I leap up and crouch, tilting my head sideways and peering out. I see nothing but a streetlight, the sidewalk, and the Rover I hijacked. Nothing else.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell, Riley?\u201d</p><p>I turn and glance at Noah, standing just inside the bathroom door. \u201cI thought I saw something. A face.\u201d I peer back outside. Still nothing but darkness and shadows. I fine-tune my hearing, and everything normal screeches to a halt. The sounds I hear now are that of a mouse\u2019s heartbeat. The scratching of some small animal against the bark of a tree. A human\u2019s breath easing in and out of lungs.</p><p>Nothing else.</p><p>I look at Noah and jump down, clutching my towel to my body. I land on the white cotton bath rug. \u201cIt was Eli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, darlin\u2019,\u201d Noah says in his Charleston drawl. \u201cThat fast and you know it was Eli?\u201d</p> <p>My head spins. \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore. Get out so I can get dressed and we can get the hell out of here,\u201d I say, frustrated. I look at Noah. \u201cIt\u2019ll only take a sec.\u201d</p><p>Noah says nothing and backs out of the bathroom.</p><p>I drop the towel and throw on my clothes. Quickly, I pull my wet hair back and secure it with a silver clip. In my room, I yank on my boots and jacket and pass Noah in the hall.</p><p>The night air is chilled; it\u2019s early November in the Highlands. Funny, I can tell it\u2019s chilly out\u2014probably more than chilly. Air is crisp. I feel the cold, feel the wind. My breath puffs out before me as warm meets cold. But it doesn\u2019t affect me as it did when I was solely human. My eyes search the dark, the shadows. I sniff the air. I listen.</p><p>Many things assault my senses.</p><p>None of them scream Eli.</p> <p>\u201cShake it off,\u201d Noah says. \u201cAnd get your head in the game.\u201d He glances at his watch. \u201cTwenty minutes till midnight. Let\u2019s get moving.\u201d One final glare, his gaze levels mine. \u201cDon\u2019t take off away from me, Riley Poe. Swear to God, I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>With one more glance around our guesthouse, we head out to Montague Row and follow it along, side by side, at a fairly brisk human walk. It\u2019s still early, and there are people moving about. Not many, but enough that I have to tune back my hearing. Too many human heartbeats, voices, whispers at once. Almost makes me dizzy. It\u2019s become so easy for me now. I just . . . think it, and it happens. Kinda scary, and I believe that particular trait came from Vic\u2019s father, Senior Arcos. In times of extreme adrenaline, though, I have to concentrate. Probably a good thing, or else people would be slapping one another in the face, pulling hair, and tripping pedestrians.</p><p>We walk down to the river Ness, and follow the walkway hugging the shore. Even at midnight on a Thursday night, it\u2019s pretty lively on the riverfront. Several pubs and eating establishments line the river, and I have to stop and take it in. The moment I halt, Noah does, too, and he looks at me. I close out the drone of human conversation, and listen for minor details. A single racing heart. A whimper. A cry of fright, of disbelief. The air catching in a throat.</p><p>Fast footfall.</p><p>Heavy, a human male. Not used to running. Heart rate around one hundred and seventy now. I cock my head, listening.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s two streets over, heading upriver, toward the bridge,\u201d I say.</p><p>We both take off fast, slipping closer into the shadows of the buildings, leaping over anything that\u2019s in our way. I\u2019m a head and neck in front of Noah, and as we hit the walkway down to the river, I see him. I can\u2019t tell his age, but I\u2019m guessing midthirties. Not used to a lot of exercise, and he\u2019s winded as hell. Dark clothes, gray woolen coat. He\u2019s got a black skully on. I scan the darkness. \u201cWhat\u2019s spooking him?\u201d</p><p>Noah and I are nearly on top of him, and we Y off from each other. I take the human, and with one leap I take him to the ground. His grunt resonates against my chest. Quickly, I roll off him and briefly glance up. Behind and above me, I see Noah leap into an ancient tree with long, heavy branches. I turn my attention to the man.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask, and jump to my feet. I extend a hand.</p><p>His face is stark white against the black skully pulled over his ears. He doesn\u2019t accept my hand, instead stares at me. Blank faced. \u201cI dunno\u2014\u201d</p><p>It happens so fast my mind spins a little as I react. Noah and another\u2014completely morphed and fanged\u2014drop from the canopy of the tree above. The vampire swings at Noah, who has him by the neck, then builds strength and lunges directly toward the human. I find my blade in the back of my jeans and hurl it at the vampire\u2019s heart. It sinks a solid inch over the hilt. The vampire drops to the ground, inches from the human. The moment his body crumples, he begins to convulse.</p><p>The man stares wide-eyed at the seizing form on the ground. Stepping closer, I place my hand on his arm and pull him away. He doesn\u2019t resist. I turn him around and force him to look at me. The whites of his eyes take up nearly the entire orb. Go straight home now. Forget you were chased. Forget what you\u2019ve seen. And for a while, stay home after dark, if you can. Hurry.</p><p>His stare vacant, the guy turns, shoves his hands into his woolen coat pockets, and starts up the sidewalk at a brisk walk. I watch him until he turns up a street and disappears.</p><p>\u201cOne more down,\u201d Noah says.</p><p>\u201cOne more saved,\u201d I reply, glancing in the direction of the frightened guy. I look at Noah. \u201cDid you get anything?\u201d</p><p>Noah shakes his head. \u201cLate twenties. Not a newblood, not old, either.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cAgain, totally random.\u201d</p><p>We continue on throughout the night, but find nothing more than a handful of drunken college students celebrating a birthday by pub crawling, a few domestic fights, and a guy out looking for his runaway dog.</p><p>My hearing picks up a female gasp. It\u2019s a scared, surprised sound. I jerk my head and stare downriver, toward a row of restaurants and pubs. No. Beyond that. A park. I hear her whispered plea. \u201cNo, please.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say to Noah. I take off. He\u2019s right behind me.</p><p>The rows we\u2019re running down are relatively even, and I think we\u2019d make better time going rooftop. I turn down a close, leap from car, wall to wall, and climb the chimney until I reach the top. Noah\u2019s a step behind me. We take off.</p><p>Across the rooftops we fly, bounding off chimneys and gutters. I\u2019m following the young woman\u2019s heartbeat. Thank God there\u2019s still one to follow. Might not be for long.</p><p>We haul over four buildings before the park is in sight. I make one final lunge and land in the branches of an old oak. Quickly I find solid footing, and I swing down.</p><p>When I land, it\u2019s just in time to see a dark head lift from the woman\u2019s neck. Her body is limp in his arms. She\u2019s blond, petite, maybe midtwenties. Wearing a pub T-shirt and jeans. The light from the streetlamp perched on the sidewalk close to the grass illuminates her face. Terror is frozen in her dead expression. Eyes wide. Eyebrows pinched. Mouth wide open in a silent scream.</p><p>The vampire holding her is in shadows. Slowly, he turns his head toward me. I see nothing but one corner of a fanged mouth tip upward into a smile.</p><p>A heavy, sickening wash of familiarity comes over me, and before I blink, he drops the dead girl and takes off into the darkness. I don\u2019t even hesitate. I follow.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d Noah calls, and starts off behind me. The one I\u2019m chasing is fast, and I\u2019m having to kick in the extra energy to keep up. I can hear Noah\u2019s footfalls fade a little with each step.</p><p>The park is deserted, and I\u2019m chasing this vampire into the shadows at the far end when suddenly, he has stopped, turned, and is facing me. I stop, too, and stare, peering into the shadows obscuring his features. I see his silhouette, though, and my insides feel sickened. Six feet. Broad shoulders. Muscular thighs. Arrogant stance.</p><p>The grass crunches behind me, and I turn my head. It\u2019s Noah.</p><p>\u201cRiley, I asked you not to take off alone,\u201d he says, distracting me for a half second.</p><p>I glance back at the figure. The vampire that has just killed a young girl.</p><p>He\u2019s gone.</p><p>I feel my knees go weak, and I want to sink to the ground, maybe even scream. I inhale instead and take off in the direction the vampire disappeared. Vampire. Killer. Bloodsucker who\u2019d just stolen a life, ruined others because of it. That girl\u2019s family will never be the same, always a hole ripped in their lives. I hate it so much it makes my insides roil with rage. I hear Noah swear and he\u2019s right behind me again.</p><p>Without thinking, I crank up the speed, and I\u2019m bounding over parked cars, rebounding off buildings, and next I\u2019m leaping rooftops again. I scan the shadows, searching for the least amount of movement. I startle a flock of roosting ravens, and their wings sound like drums going off in my head. They slow me just enough for Noah to get his hands on me and yank me to a halt.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d he says harshly, and snatches me toward him. Both of his hands grip my shoulders. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>I look at my partner\u2019s face, and shadows fall across most of it. It\u2019s Noah, though. I know that. For a second, I\u2019m dazed. What the hell\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>Who was I just chasing?</p><p>I shift my gaze across the city\u2019s skyline. Down the river, the castle lights are still on. Dawn is close to breaking, and I see the river Ness moving like a black eel below me. I look at Noah, who is studying me with a cautious look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m losing my mind,\u201d I say, barely above a whisper. \u201cIt has to be residual from entering that alternative plane.\u201d I shake my head and lift my gaze to meet Noah\u2019s. \u201cWhy do I keep seeing Eli?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cYou thought that vampire back there was Eli?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cCome on, Riley. Eli Dupr\u00e9? Your fianc\u00e9? My closest friend? Original guardian of Savannah? Entrusted by Preacher and Estelle? Forsake his parents? Eli, turned dark?\u201d Again, he shakes his head and lets go of my shoulders. \u201cNo fucking way, Riley. It wasn\u2019t him. Your mind\u2019s playing tricks on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhy, ever since St. Bueno\u2019s, am I seeing him, Noah? Am I crazy? Am I being tormented?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah looks down at me, his silvery eyes soft. \u201cI don\u2019t think you are seeing him, darlin\u2019. I think . . . ,\u201d He grabs my chin and lifts it closer to him. \u201cI think he is consuming your mind right now. You know Arcos made it out alive, and you want more than anything for the same to happen to Eli. I get that. And he may have. But he\u2019s not killing innocents.\u201d Noah\u2019s eyes hold mine. \u201cHe\u2019s just not.\u201d</p><p>The sun is just cracking the horizon. What were shadows and darkness are now haze and fuzzy light. I see Noah\u2019s face clearly. He\u2019s probably the most sincere soul I know. \u201cThen why,\u201d I say to him, \u201cam I seeing him in a bad way? Killing people?\u201d</p><p>One corner of Noah\u2019s mouth lifts. \u201cNow, that I can\u2019t explain, Ms. Poe. But you need to relax. Concentrate. And let\u2019s get this job done. Then we\u2019ll work on Eli.\u201d He taps my nose. \u201cTogether. With Andorra.\u201d</p> <p>I heave a sigh. \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Noah inclines his head toward the ground. \u201cYou ready to hop off this rooftop before we draw a crowd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019d better,\u201d I say, and leap the two and a half stories to a side alley. Noah lands beside me, and we walk toward the river. Early-morning businesses are opening up. Bakers, butchers, tourist shops. It\u2019s Friday morning, and there\u2019s a certain feel in the wind. Maybe it\u2019s coming from the youth, looking forward to a little fun? Kids out of school? Whatever it is, I know the streets of Inverness are no longer safe. Three rouge vampires killed already. One on the loose, and I have no idea who that one is.</p><p>Despite Noah\u2019s insistence that it wasn\u2019t Eli, I pray for it to not be.</p><p>It\u2019s only a matter of time before the local police discover the bodies being drained of blood, or minus a very important organ, are more than a fluke. Nothing screams serial killer more than a few dead bodies piling up.</p> <p>Makes me wonder if that guy, before I put the mind whammy on him, knows just how lucky he is. That he was a half second away from having his blood sucked from his body. Maybe it\u2019s best that he doesn\u2019t know. Sometimes I wish I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk the city today, in the daylight,\u201d Noah suggests. \u201cArriving here after dark, taking off on a blind hunt.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t like to work that way. Inverness isn\u2019t too big. Let\u2019s head back to the guesthouse, get the maps Andorra gave us, and hit the streets.\u201d He drapes an arm over one of my shoulders. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I meet Noah Miles\u2019s encouraging gaze. If anyone can make you believe in yourself, or a cause, it\u2019s Noah Freaking Miles. Must be left over in his human DNA from the Revolutionary War.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight it is,\u201d he says, reading my mind. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We slip into the streets of Inverness, mingling with the mortals walking to work, to school, tourists checking out St. Andrew\u2019s Cathedral, Inverness Castle.</p><p>All completely incoherent to the fact that an immortal killer, the very top of the food chain, stalks them. Probably more than one.</p> <p>Police sirens echo close by, resonating off the stone and brick of the buildings. I can tell where it\u2019s headed. The park. To that poor dead girl we left there.</p><p>Yeah. No matter who is responsible. They have to be stopped.</p><p>Even if it kills me.</p><p>Part Three</p><p>OLDE BLOOD</p><p>A storm\u2019s coming.</p><p>\u2014James Bond, Skyfall, 2012</p><p>I don\u2019t usually worry overmuch about Riley anymore, but after Miles\u2019s mobile call, even I admit it. She\u2019s worrying me. \u2019Tis a dangerous chance, entering that alternative world like she did. Victorian Arcos, well, I haven\u2019t seen him myself, but I have spoken with him. He seems stable. Seems himself. I\u2019ve reached into his mind, and I don\u2019t sense anything sinister that wasn\u2019t already there before. But one thing I do know about alternative realms. Sometimes what comes out isn\u2019t always what went in. Riley Poe could be in more danger than she thinks. That doesn\u2019t sit verra well with me.</p> <p>\u2014Jake Andorra</p><p>The rest of the morning is spent first going over the map of Inverness, spread out on the kitchen table. Noah and I hunch over the creased, new map, shoulder to shoulder, studying. Inverness isn\u2019t very large, so we then head out into the city itself. We hit every main artery road, close, and dead-end street in the City Centre on foot, and fan out to the river and industrial park by cab. I suspect to most onlookers, Noah and I are just another touring couple on vacay. What they don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt, as the saying goes. Rather, possibly, won\u2019t kill.</p><p>Yet despite Noah\u2019s encouraging words to get my mind in the game, my thoughts stray to Eli. I just can\u2019t help it. He was taken from me, and I want him back. Badly. Why can\u2019t he be here now? Why did Vic make it home, but not Eli?</p><p>As my eyes take in the Scottish city, I daydream about what it\u2019d be like to be here just as a regular couple in love, touring the city. The Highlands. Taking a boat out onto Loch Ness and searching for Nessie. Walking the hillsides, and traipsing through ancient castle ruins. A ping of jealousy roils inside me at all the regular people living regular lives. Wake up, eat breakfast, go to work, socialize, come home. Normal stuff. Jesus Christ, I\u2019m about as far from normal as I can possibly fucking be.</p><p>I want my goddamn life back.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Noah says, and I look at him. His eyes soften. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>I heave a sigh. \u201cI swear, I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me into a side hug, kisses the top of my head, and we continue on.</p><p>The Scots are a friendly people whom I find I like more and more as I spend time here. I wish so much of this time wasn\u2019t spent on killing and death. It\u2019s inevitable, though, and the more I stop complaining about it, the faster I\u2019ll accept it. It\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do. Stop a killer. Apparently, more than one. Wanna know something weird? Sometimes, even though I know it has to be done, somewhere far in the recesses of my brain, I\u2019m saddened that I reduce bloodsuckers to a shimmering puddle of white goop. They used to be people. Sons. Daughters. Sisters. Brothers. Friends. Lovers. Who would ever look at a vampire, whether on TV, or in a movie, or like me, in life, and give him or her a soul? I guess it has to do with the fact that my family now is made up of age-old vampires who care not only about me, my brother, Seth, and other humans, but about one another. Makes me wonder how it\u2019s possible they\u2014Noah, Eli, and his family\u2014can do it. How they can care, but others can\u2019t. Or won\u2019t. I\u2019m doing a lot of reflecting lately. Whatever that means.</p><p>Noah stops a few people on the street, locals at the university, maybe. The early-twenties crowd. They tell us where the best clubs are, best caf\u00e9s, best pubs. We find our way to some of the seedier parts of the city. Inverness is friendly and welcoming, so what\u2019s seedy isn\u2019t very noticeable to any ordinary eye. But Noah can sniff out a punk, and we find a group of four huddled against a building near the industrial park. Late teens, early twenties, trying their best to look tough as hell. Doing a good job of it, too. Every one of them is dragging on a cigarette. We walk up, and one kid, wearing a thick, ratty-looking gray woolen sweater and a black skully, pushes off the wall he\u2019s leaning on and pulls long on his smoke. His eyes are locked on to mine. They shift momentarily to the black wing inked at the corner of my cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d he says in a thick accent. He moves his gaze to Noah.</p><p>\u201cWhere can we score some shit?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>The kid laughs, and the others chuckle with him. \u201cWha\u2019 makes ya think I know where tae get shit?\u201d the kid asks, then looks at me. \u201cAmericans. On holiday, aye? This your brother, love?\u201d He inclines his head toward Noah.</p><p>A sharp sparkle lights his gaze as he studies Noah. Intelligent guy, maybe nineteen, and he\u2019s pretty cute. Green eyes, along with a flawless complexion and strong jaw. Dark eyebrows, nicely shaped, so he must have dark hair beneath the skully. Makes me freaking sick that he\u2019s such a dumb-ass, wasting his life on drugs. He must be early on in the game because his eyes are too quick for him to have been doing it for too long. They make easy prey for vampires, the druggies. It\u2019s why we find them, find out where they hang, sell, buy. There\u2019s a chance we might just save their sorry lives.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d I say to him.</p><p>\u201cHopin\u2019,\u201d he answers, and grins. Bright white, wide smile. Wicked-strong accent. Maybe we got these kids all wrong. He\u2019s tall, stands eye to eye with Noah.</p><p>I just stare at him.</p><p>\u201cI never fook wi\u2019 the stuff,\u201d he says to Noah, and studies him. \u201cYou dunna, either.\u201d He glances at me, then back to Noah. \u201cCops?\u201d His eyes drift from my feet to my eyes. \u201cNah. No\u2019 cops. But somethin\u2019 else.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Smart kid all right. \u201cClubs?\u201d I ask. You got clubs people go to for a good time, drink, dance, and hook up. Then you have the ones notorious for . . . other stuff. Both are hunting grounds for a rogue vampire. But the one with high-traffic lawlessness instinctively draws the worst kinds. People and vamps.</p><p>\u201cBoyo\u2019s,\u201d one of the other guys offers. He draws on his cigarette and points with it. \u201cFour streets over, one up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCost ya eight quid tae get in,\u201d another claims. \u201cWorth every pence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if ya fancy a good tune or two, try Hush 51. Just up the river a ways,\u201d the leader claims with a grin. \u201cThey\u2019ve a fine live band this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the other added. \u201cfinest in the bloody Highlands.\u201d</p><p>I lift an eyebrow. Sassy little shits. We\u2019re talking to the whole band.</p><p>Noah chuckles. \u201cWhat time do you start?\u201d</p><p>The leader blows smoke. \u201cNine.\u201d He inclines his head. \u201cGerry. Tate. Pete. Drums, keyboard, electric fiddle.\u201d He jabs his hand out to Noah. \u201cRhine,\u201d he says, and winks at me. \u201cBass and vocals, love.\u201d</p><p>What a hot dog.</p><p>\u201cNoah, Riley,\u201d Noah introduces. \u201cSorry for the mix-up.\u201d</p><p>Rhine shrugs. \u201cHappens,\u201d he claims, and glances at his band. \u201cWe do look a wee bit thuggish, aye?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The others all chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOy, are ya here, then, because o\u2019 the murders?\u201d Tate asks.

I guess I\u2019ll have to dip into minds a little more often before assuming. And on that note, I decide something before leaving. I give Rhine a smile. \u201cThanks. See ya round, maybe.\u201d</p><p>He smiles back.</p><p>And I level my gaze at all four band members, ending with Rhine. Take the cigarettes out of your mouths, drop them onto the ground, and crush them.</p><p>Rhine immediately takes his cigarette out, drops it, and smashes it with his boot. The others, in sync, do the same.</p><p>Don\u2019t smoke. Anything. Ever again. Cold-turkey quit. Nod if you understand.</p><p>All four guys nod at once.</p> <p>Noah shakes his head and stares at me with admiration. Probably a little envy, too. He inclines his head, we say good-bye to the guys, and leave. When we round the block, he glances over at me. \u201cSo now you\u2019re the poster child for the quit-smoking club, huh?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYeah, I guess. Just thought I\u2019d throw it in. Wish some noble mind reader would\u2019ve stopped my smoking habit when I was a little younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stopped it yourself,\u201d Noah says.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I think Preacher and Estelle put some root doctor whammy on me.\u201d</p><p>Noah chuckles, and we continue up the street. Surrounded by gray stone buildings, we draw closer to the touristy city center. We pass a chippy, a Celtic jeweler, and a kilt maker. As I glance into the large picture window of the kilt maker, an image catches my eye. Eli. My heart leaps.</p><p>In the middle of the walkway I snap my head to stare across the street. Passersby walk up and down the sidewalk. No Eli. No one out of the ordinary. Grabbing the door handle, I enter MacClennon\u2019s Fine Kilts.</p><p>A wave of spice and lavender hits me in the nose as I walk into the small shop. Racks display finely pressed kilts of all sizes. An open oak closet exhibits woolen gloves, mittens, and hats. A thick iron-legged table presents rows of fingerless gloves of all colors, made of lamb\u2019s wool. In the corner, my eyes light on the cashier. She\u2019s wearing her graying hair in a high bun and sporting a dark green vest, a white cotton shirt, and a blue-and-black-plaid tie. She smiles broadly.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d she says. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d</p> <p>I smile back as my eyes scan the room. \u201cNo, thank you. Just looking.\u201d I mull through the store, notice a few tourists sorting through the various sizes of kilts. One woman sifts through the gloves.</p><p>No sign of Eli. Or anyone who even remotely looks anything like him.</p><p>I wave at the graying woman, and turn to leave. I almost knock into Noah.</p><p>We both head outside. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I stare across the street, then up and down the sidewalk. I shrug and walk on. \u201cNothing. Thought I saw something.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re moving through the afternoon crowd now, and Noah is a half step behind me. Kids in school black-and-white uniforms are weaving with us, as well as a few tourists and locals. I wish I could send out one big mental warning, a juju heads-up, saying Everyone stay inside after dark! so that no one here gets butchered. I don\u2019t like not knowing what\u2019s what. And I seriously don\u2019t like having the cold sensation of sensing Eli\u2019s presence in a threatening way. It\u2019s leaving an aftertaste in my mouth that\u2019s beyond hideous.</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>I glance up at Noah, then back to the sidewalk. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>When we round the corner, he pulls me to a stop. \u201cYou thought you saw Eli again.\u201d</p><p>A man passes by, and his eyes are level with mine. He spares Noah a brief glance and almost pauses, as though worried we\u2019re having a domestic dispute. I can see it in his aging blue eyes. I smile at him and nod, and he returns the gesture and moves on. Nice to know chivalry exists still in humans.</p><p>I sigh and meet Noah\u2019s penetrating gaze. \u201cFirst, you have to stop glaring at me like that in public. And stop grabbing me, too. That old guy was an inch from busting your ass right here on the sidewalk.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s body relaxes, and his eyes soften, just a little.</p><p>\u201cYes, I thought I saw Eli again,\u201d I answer him. I shove my hands deep into the pockets of my jacket. \u201cWhen I glanced at the store window as we passed that kilt maker\u2019s store, I saw his reflection in the glass.\u201d I looked up at him. \u201cThe second I turned my head to search the street, he wasn\u2019t there. I think I\u2019m losing my mind,\u201d I finish.</p><p>Noah studies me for a second or two. His jaw muscle tightens. \u201cI wish you were. That\u2019s fixable.\u201d He glances out over the cobbled street, and his gaze scales the building in front of us. He studies the skyline for a moment longer. \u201cWhat scares me\u201d\u2014Noah looks back at me\u2014\u201cis that you\u2019re not losing your mind.\u201d With a nod, he inclines his head. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the map. We\u2019ve got about an hour and a half before nightfall.\u201d</p><p>We start back up the street and head to the guesthouse. Noah\u2019s words have bugged the hell out of me. He left his meaning unanswered, but I knew it, no matter how hard he disputed it. Knew it just as my body knows how to breathe without conscious thought. Yet his words claw at me the whole way back, and even while we\u2019re sitting at the kitchen table, hunched over the map and planning our route for the night\u2019s hunt, it bothers me.</p><p>He\u2019s scared Eli is back from that alternative realm.</p><p>And that he\u2019s not the same Eli.</p><p>A cold shiver runs down my spine at the thought. I try to push it aside, that thought, but it lingers, and soon it feels like fire ants are pinching and biting my insides. I need to get out. Get some fresh air. Just be alone for a few minutes.</p><p>I push away from the table and stand. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d Noah warns, and rises with me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even,\u201d I warn in return. \u201cI have to get some air. Clear my head.\u201d I frown at him. \u201cAlone. Kinda like peeing without someone standing there, watching. I need a little alone time, Miles. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>Emotion flutters across his handsome features, and I know he\u2019s struggling with letting me out by myself. He wants to protect me, be by my side continuously to make sure nothing happens.</p><p>Well, that\u2019s all great, but I gotta have a breather.</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m just walking up the street to the market and back.\u201d When his face still pinches with confliction, I force a small smile. \u201cPromise. Back before dark.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s almost funny to see a vampire imitate a sigh. It\u2019s breathless, only going through the human motion he did for so long. Noah rubs his eyes and nods. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think you can handle yourself. There\u2019s something out there, Riley. And we don\u2019t know exactly what yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires,\u201d I offer. \u201cWe knew that coming here.\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cSmart-ass. It\u2019s more than that and you know it.\u201d He stares at me. \u201cCall me if anything goes on. And I don\u2019t mean on my cell phone.\u201d</p><p>Pushing my arm through the sleeve of my leather jacket, I nod. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in thirty,\u201d Noah reminds me.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I agree, and close the door.</p><p>Outside, the shades of late-afternoon drift over the cobbles. It\u2019s crazy here in the winter months. November, and it gets full-on dark at four thirty in the afternoon.</p><p>As I walk, it starts to drizzle a freezing, misting rain. I briefly meet the friendly gazes of passersby, young and old, as they hurry home, hurry to the pubs, to the market. A gray haze hangs in the air, so thick I have to fight not to swipe it away with my hand.</p><p>Suddenly, memories of home, of before Edinburgh and Eli\u2019s . . . whatever that was . . . happened. I miss home. I miss Preacher and Estelle, my wonderful surrogate grandparents. I miss Nyx, my best friend. Seth, my baby brother. Eli\u2019s family.</p><p>I miss that time. Living on the salt water surrounded by oaks and Spanish moss, tattooing people for a living. Eating Krystal hamburgers until I thought I\u2019d puke. The pungent scent of the marsh at low tide. Having tea with Preacher and Estelle every morning.</p><p>And when I first fell in love with a vampire. When Eli was well, strong, and determined to guard the lives of Savannah\u2019s mortals. I miss my tattoo shop, Inksomnia, and I miss creating, the artwork, the hum of my ink gun. How life has changed since then.</p><p>If I could only have Eli back, the rest I could deal with.</p><p>Almost finished with my self\u2013pity party, I turn the corner and the open market is before me. Although the shadows from the building and pending nightfall stretch long over the row of flower bouquets and fruit containers, people mill about making their choices. I look out of place, dressed in all black with a wing inked at the corner of my eye. Long dark hair with a few random fuchsia chunks added in. And although people can\u2019t see them, I have just under a half dozen blades sheathed beneath my clothes. Yeah. I love open markets, too. Flowers, food, and random stuff. Takes my mind off all the bullshit. . . .</p><p>Then, as I\u2019m sifting through the hoards of gorgeous flowers, a sensation crawls over me. Without much thought, I glance over my shoulder. Through the crowd, his height and stature rises above everyone else. Everyone mortal. His gaze locks on to mine.</p><p>My slow-beating heart plummets to my stomach, and I drop the flowers back into the bin and move toward him. Don\u2019t take your eyes off him this time, Poe. Keep staring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare as long as I can. My eyes start to water, burn. Then I can\u2019t help it\u2014I blink.</p><p>And he\u2019s not in the same place. Shit!</p><p>My eyes search the crowd frantically as I weave through them, dodging shoppers and market workers packing up for the evening. Then I see him again. He\u2019s standing beneath an awning, and I hurry toward him. Eli! I scream his name in my head. Eligius Dupr\u00e9, goddamn it! I see him. I see people stepping around him to pass by. I\u2019m not imagining this. He\u2019s not a mirage. He\u2019s really here. And I\u2019m not losing my fucking mind.</p> <p>A slight smile touches his mouth. At first, my heart melts at the sight of it. The memories. The familiarity.</p><p>Then it changes. Something snaps in his eyes, and his smile contorts.</p><p>The absolute coldness of it sends a feeling of dread clear to my bones. It chills me.</p><p>I\u2019m moving fast now, my eyes glued to Eli. When he turns, he fades into the crowd, but I still see his broad shoulders. He\u2019s wearing a black leather jacket. Dark jeans. I\u2019m not losing him this time. As we move out of the market area, the crowd thins, and Eli turns up the street toward the river Ness. High above the city center, the castle lights flicker on ahead, illuminating the red sandstone fortress of Inverness Castle through the wintry haze. Eli\u2019s stride is long. Purposeful. He knows where he\u2019s going. Whether he knows I\u2019m following him, I can\u2019t tell. But he doesn\u2019t look back when he turns off Union and onto Church Street.</p><p>He\u2019s barely out of sight when I break into a run. I turn the same corner and pull up short, searching the darkness cast in streetlights and shadows. Few people are on the sidewalk. Not one of them is Eli.</p> <p>Shit! I break into a run and make it to the end of the street. Looking both ways, I can\u2019t find him. I can\u2019t even sense him. And just as I\u2019m about to take off running again, I\u2019m grabbed by the shoulder and jerked back. My feet almost leave the ground, and I\u2019m knocked against the closed storefront\u2019s double oak doors. My eyes are wide as I stare up at Noah. The streetlight shines on only half his face.</p><p>He\u2019s pissed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Riley?\u201d he says angrily, in a low voice. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Snatched out of my crazed momentary stupor, I shake Noah off and push away from the door. \u201cI\u2019m not losing my mind. I just followed Eli from the market. I saw him totally clear, Noah,\u201d I say. I wait for a couple to pass us, and I glance in their direction and lower my voice. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a black leather jacket, dark jeans. People dodged him. He looked me dead in the eye and I saw his face.\u201d I think about the chilling smile that sent shivers down my spine. \u201cHe\u2019s not right, just like you thought. But I saw him. And he saw me. And for a second, I don\u2019t know. He did look like himself.\u201d I look at Noah, pleading for him to understand. \u201cThen it changed. He changed. And when he smiled at me, I felt cold as hell. It was him, Noah. Swear to God.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s staring at me. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer. No hesitation. \u201cDead sure.\u201d</p> <p>Noah grabs his cell phone and makes a call. He stares at me as he speaks, and I can hear every word exchanged between him and Jake Andorra.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sure,\u201d Noah says.</p><p>\u201cJesus. You canna let her off alone,\u201d Andorra says. \u201cHe\u2019s unpredictable now.\u201d</p><p>That makes my insides ache.</p><p>Noah lifts an eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you want me to do, Jake? Cuff her to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have to.\u201d</p><p>Noah swears. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to her,\u201d Jake says. Noah hands the phone to me.</p> <p>\u201cJake,\u201d I say, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I figure an age-old vampire like Jake Andorra, plus someone who has known Eli for too long to count in years, would know something. Give me some sort of clue as to what the hell is happening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure,\u201d he answers.</p><p>Give me a freaking break.</p><p>Jake reads my thoughts, and chuckles. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too damn funny.</p><p>\u201cRiley, something\u2019s happened to Eli and I don\u2019t know what yet. The fact that he\u2019s appearing to you, although eluding you at the same time, means something. Almost as if he remembers you, and wants to connect. But he\u2019s dangerous. We canna trust him. You canna trust him. Not now. Maybe not ever again.\u201d</p><p>My heart sinks. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Riley,\u201d Jake says. His tone is stern, his accent heavier than usual. That means he\u2019s not only pissed, but worried. And I hate it. \u201cYou canna abandon your mission for the sake of Eli. He may verra well be causing the bloodbath there in Inverness. Do you want innocents to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I answer angrily. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not abandoning anything. I saw him. I followed him. I want to find out what the hell is wrong with him, Jake. Why Victorian can pop home to Romania safe and sound, and Eli just . . . disappears.\u201d I\u2019m so exasperated talking about this, I almost growl. \u201cAnd now he has reappeared. And I want him back, Jake. I won\u2019t give up on him, either. He\u2019s my fianc\u00e9. Or don\u2019t you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, girl, I remember,\u201d he answers. \u201cBut dunna you forget that I know what he is.\u201d His voice is low, edgy. \u201cWhat we all are. And I know his full potential. You won\u2019t go anywhere alone again. No\u2019 a breath o\u2019 fresh air. No\u2019 a run to the chippy. Nothing. Nowhere without Miles. If I have this problem wi\u2019 you again, I\u2019ll pull you from the mission and fly your arse back to Savannah. Ya ken?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s staring a hole through my head. His mercury eyes are all but illuminated in the shadows of the awning we\u2019re standing beneath. My blood is boiling, but what\u2019s left to do?</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ken, I ken,\u201d I answer Jake. Meaning, in Scot\u2019s terms, that I get it. I understand.</p><p>\u201cGood. And dunna try your mind warpin\u2019 on Miles again. He cares about what happens to you. As do I. And I promise we\u2019ll do everything we can to fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t now. Ginger isn\u2019t stable enough to leave. As soon as I can, though, I will.\u201d</p><p>Ginger Slater is one of my WUP team members. She recently transitioned from human trainee to werewolf elite. She\u2019s as unpredictable right now as Eli, I guess, and in the midst of a werewolf war.</p><p>\u201cYou guessed right,\u201d Jake says, using his capabilities to read my thoughts. \u201cTake care, Riley. And stay close to Miles. He\u2019s the best chance you\u2019ve got right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I answer. Jake hangs up, and I hand the phone back to Noah. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. And I mean it. \u201cI . . . panicked, I guess. I saw Eli. He moved. I followed. I didn\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>Noah jams his cell phone in the inside pocket of his jacket. \u201cYeah. You just don\u2019t want me to cuff you.\u201d He grins. \u201cTo me.\u201d</p><p>I like that there\u2019s still some small part of Noah, post vow-making to keep me safe, that is still lighthearted enough to joke around. If anyone wanted to be cuffed to me, it\u2019d be Noah Miles, perverted vampire extraordinaire. I miss the old Noah. Nasty as hell, but fun.</p><p>His grin widens as he, too, reads my mind. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I guess nothing\u2019s fun anymore. Definitely nothing normal. And none of it will be until all of this crazy shit is fixed.</p><p>And Eli is back with me. Safe.</p><p>We then hit the streets. I have a sense of unsettledness. It\u2019s hard to explain. I\u2019m on edge, like I feel something is so very not right. Something besides Eli\u2019s unpredictability. With Noah on one side of the street, and me on the other, we search. Listen. Smell the air. Neither of us catches the first sign of a predator. Or a victim.</p><p>By nine, Noah holds the door for me as we enter Hush 51. It\u2019s Friday night, and while not many tourists are lingering in Inverness, the local crowd\u2014especially the college crowd\u2014has packed the club. There\u2019s alcohol. Maybe light drugs. Either way, it makes a human vulnerable, as well as an easy target for a vampire on the prowl. Noah had suggested we hit the club, and I\u2019d agreed. Plus, I was a little curious about Rhine and his bandmates.</p><p>The dark wood interior of Hush 51 is polished and shining, and the low lights cast an amber hue over the crowd standing and sitting before the band. Rhine sees us enter, and he grins widely and gives us a nod.</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, settle down, ye feisty wicked pub jumpers,\u201d a man with a Hush 51 T-shirt announces at the mic. \u201cHard Knox, if ye fancy\u2014\u201d</p><p>The locals cheer and yell, and Rhine and the guys start up. So their band is called Hard Knox. Pretty cool. The pub is quaking and humming with music, and for a second I\u2019m distracted by Rhine\u2019s voice. It\u2019s pretty goddamn good. I listen to him as my gaze slides over the crowd. I\u2019m now at the bar, and I nod at the bartender. \u201cAye, lass?\u201d he says with a smile. The gap between his front teeth is endearing.</p><p>\u201cPint,\u201d I respond, and he serves me one. I take a sip. Noah\u2019s right next to me.</p><p>Then all at once, everything happens. It\u2019s as if, without my permission, my own tendencies turn on at the same time. Rhine\u2019s voice fades. The patrons\u2019 voices fine-tune, and all their words are going off at once in my head. A cold, icy sensation washes over me, and instinctively, I turn around on my barstool and glance toward the far corner.</p><p>Noah\u2019s leather jacket creaks from the motion of him turning, too.</p><p>Eli\u2019s there. A woman\u2019s beside him. Tall. Almost as tall as he is. Dark, long auburn hair that falls in waves to her waist. Flawless alabaster skin and pouty full lips. Who the hell is she?</p><p>At the same moment my brain sends a message to my legs, I slide off the barstool. My heart feels like it\u2019s beating out of my chest. They\u2019re both looking at me, Eli and the woman, and just as I\u2019m about to start making my way through the crowd, the woman reaches up and grazes Eli\u2019s jaw with her hand. She smiles at me. My eyes lock with Eli\u2019s.</p><p>He knows me. I can see it. And I can also see his eyes flash with . . . something. Regret? Struggle? What the hell? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then a darkness clouds Eli\u2019s eyes, and he lowers his head, presses his mouth to hers, and kisses her.</p><p>I\u2019m frozen to the floor, unable to breathe, much less move. I actually wheeze as my breath leaves my lungs. It\u2019s painful, and a little dizzying. The crowd seems oblivious of me as I stare, paralyzed, while Eli seductively makes out with the redhead. Emotions run through me fast, and before I finish with pain and sorrow, fury takes over. I feel a hand on my shoulder. It\u2019s Noah, and I reach behind me and grab his hand. My eyes are locked on to Eli and the woman. I start to move toward them. The overwhelming urge to kick her ass takes over me. My body tenses. Noah squeezes my hand.</p><p>And that\u2019s when the woman breaks Eli\u2019s kiss and looks dead at me.</p> <p>Her tongue runs across her lips. And then she smiles and beckons to me with a long, delicate finger. I hear her voice, melodic tinged with an ancient accent, in my head.</p><p>Come here, Riley Poe. I\u2019ve got something to show you. Something that\u2019s mine. . . .</p><p>I hear Rhine\u2019s voice over the mic, his sexy sound crooning over the crowd. Drums. Keyboard. Fiddle. Bass. My feet start to move, as if they\u2019ve been instructed to do so against my will, and my hand drops Noah\u2019s as I weave through the crowd.</p><p>Toward the woman and Eli.</p><p>The music almost lulls me into a trance as I ease through the crowd. I don\u2019t understand why my body is complying, and why I\u2019m not running full force at the woman, knocking her back, and grabbing and shaking Eli until he snaps out of whatever weird zombie state he\u2019s in. But I can\u2019t. I just keep walking toward them. The woman continues to beckon me, and she slips her hand inside Eli\u2019s jacket. She places her head against his chest, and Eli\u2019s arm drapes around her shoulders and pulls her tightly against him. He\u2019s not looking at me. Not meeting my gaze now.</p> <p>Even with my eyes glued to the chilling smile on the woman\u2019s face, I can\u2019t stop.</p><p>When I step through the last couple, dancing and singing along with Rhine\u2019s band, the lights are now flickering to keep with the beat. The music hums just under the surface of my skin, a fierce vibration that keeps me fixated on only what\u2019s in front of me. Eli and this new woman. I\u2019m now less than two feet from them both, and the woman looks at me with icy blue eyes. Her full lips tip upward, and her tongue darts out to lick her bottom one. She smiles.</p><p>Watch us.</p><p>My eyes are locked onto the woman and Eli less than two feet away as she tips her head to the side and draws closer to Eli. His eyes, those cerulean blue and sometimes stormy orbs that I fell in love with, pierce me now, and for a split second, I see hesitation. A flash of anger in his eyes. Then he stiffens, and those eyes now stay focused on my gaze as he lowers his head and moves his mouth over the woman\u2019s. His hand threads through her hair, pulling her head backward just a bit, and his other hand skims her throat and grasps her jaw. His tongue sweeps hers, the light glistening off its moisture, and their passion is as palpable as my own pulse. Not once does his gaze leave mine as he kisses her. The lights flash, the music thumps, and I can\u2019t do anything except stand there and watch them. As if I\u2019m rooted to the wooden floor beneath me, paralyzed in place to stand and watch my fianc\u00e9 engage in a sensual, sexually charged kiss with another woman.</p><p>I try to turn my head, but I can\u2019t. Literally, physically can\u2019t. Inside, I\u2019m screaming. I\u2019m dying. I\u2019m having a mental Jerry Springer moment where I\u2019ve kicked off my boots, yanking that bitch off the chair by her hair and whipping her ass for kissing my man. But it\u2019s all mental. I can\u2019t do a single thing except watch.</p><p>The woman drops her hand from Eli\u2019s chest and lets it drag slowly down his abdomen. He pulls her closer, and her hand moves over his crotch. Eli\u2019s mouth leaves hers and he kisses her throat, and his eyes are hazed and locked on to mine as his mouth tips up in a grin. All the while, Rhine\u2019s music jams the club, and everyone around us is rocking and singing, having a swell time. It\u2019s as if no one else notices that Eli and this woman are nearly having sex, right out in the open. Like no one else sees them but me. Like no one sees me, either. Where the hell is Noah?</p> <p>What the hell\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>I concentrate. Focus. I stare hard at her, then at Eli. Stop, Eli. Let her the fuck go.</p><p>For a split second, something flashes in Eli\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s so fast, and so short-lived I almost question if it really happened. He wraps his arms around her waist and pulls her onto his lap. He\u2019s now sitting on a barstool, and he drops his mouth to her temple. The woman smiles.</p><p>Then the smile vanishes. I see nothing but hard, ice-cold hatred in her eyes.</p><p>In a blurring motion, she waves one hand in a gesture over the crowd. Her lips move, but I don\u2019t understand the low murmur coming from them.</p><p>I feel the movement before I see it. It\u2019s a low-frequency hum that nestles beneath the music, gains tempo, and then just like the sonic boom in the forest, explodes. The windows of Hush 51 blow completely out, sending shards of glass pummeling into the streets. Screams begin penetrating the trance I\u2019m in; lights are flashing and then extinguish. Shadows and the scent of human terror wash over me, and I\u2019m dazed, standing there, paralyzed on the floor. One second, I see the blaze of Eli\u2019s eyes in the dark. The pale white skin of the woman he\u2019s holding.</p><p>Her face, completely morphed into full-blown vampire. Incisors twice as long as the rest of her jagged white teeth drop from her gums, and her face extends forward, bones accommodating the change. Her eyes flash bloodred. Dark veins snake across her alabaster skin.</p><p>In the next second, amid the crowd\u2019s panic, they\u2019re gone. She, Eli. Vanished.</p> <p>Slowly, after a few seconds, my paralysis lifts. I shake my head. Even my vision has gone blurry. I shake my head again, and then my shoulders are grabbed and I\u2019m yanked around. I\u2019m shocked to see Rhine standing there, looking down at me. I didn\u2019t realize the kid was that tall.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, lass?\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d best get out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d Noah says, suddenly by my side.</p><p>Chaos is all around me. People are running, knocking into me now, and my stupor is slowly vanishing. I glance at Rhine. \u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s get these people out of here.\u201d</p><p>Patrons are running around, frightened and screaming, and everyone is trying to fit through the narrow, double oak doors of the club. Rhine and his band members have dispersed, trying to calm people, get them to calmly exit the club. It\u2019s not working.</p><p>My mind is jumbled. Eli, the woman. She\u2019s a vampire. I know that now. The Hush 51 patrons. Priority seizes my brain, and I push vampires out of my thoughts.</p><p>I focus on the human crowd.</p><p>Stop!</p><p>As if I\u2019d pushed the PAUSE button on a DVD remote, everyone stops in their tracks. I waste no time in hurrying to the front doors. I kick open the props so they both stand wide. After a brief scan of the sidewalk and street, I notice people there have stopped, too. Amazing what a panicky human with tendencies can accomplish.</p><p>I run back inside, weaving through the stone-still patrons. Noah\u2019s standing there, right where I left him. Not moving.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>I grasp his hand, and catch his gaze. Let\u2019s go. I say that only to Noah.</p><p>His eyes immediately brighten, and then he scowls. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He leads the way out of Hush 51, and once we\u2019re back outside, I glance at the patrons behind me, standing in a building that might not be so stable.</p><p>Everyone, fall into two single files and walk calmly out through the front doors.</p><p>As if a bunch of zombies being commanded by a voodoo priestess, the patrons all fall into two lines inside the club. Slowly, they start moving outside. I see now that they\u2019re not running one another over, stampede-style, so I grasp Noah\u2019s hand and pull.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say.</p><p>Now he\u2019s in front of me, pulling me by the hand. \u201cPretty impressive, Poe,\u201d he says as we run side by side up the street, toward the river walk. \u201cNot even sure I can pull something like that off.\u201d He grins and faces the street. \u201cHuman shenanigans never cease to amaze me.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re running down High Street now, and it\u2019s a no-traffic, pedestrian-only road. Most of the businesses are closed for the night, but the streetlights illuminate the paved sidewalks, and the occasional open storefront beams its light\u2019s hue, causing shadows to stretch from sidewalk to sidewalk. The road itself is cobbled, not as old as Edinburgh, I imagine, but still pretty damn old. I\u2019m barely paying any attention to Noah\u2019s comment as we hurry along. I\u2019ve now got only one thing on my mind. Well, two.</p><p>Eli and that female vampire.</p><p>Who the hell was she? And why does it matter so much to her to see me suffer?</p><p>No words are spoken between me and Noah, yet we both know each other so well we\u2019re simultaneously searching the streets, the shadows, for Eli and the female. I home in on movements, too. Shifts in the air. Off-key sound waves that belong to neither a rat, nor a human, nor a hedgehog. I sense nothing.</p><p>Not at first.</p><p>My mind is working so hard, trying to sense and make sense of what\u2019s just happened, that I now realize we\u2019re at the curving walkway of the river Ness. I stop and stare into the water, its black depths glimmering with shards of light casting down from the streetlamps holding my gaze as I try to ignore the images of Eli embracing, kissing the female. Pain sears my insides. I feel as if someone a lot larger and stronger than me has sucker-punched me in the gut. I physically hurt. It almost doubles me over. I can\u2019t hear anything right now except the cries of my own self\u2013pity party.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Noah says, and he drapes his arm over my shoulders and pulls me against him. His body is hard, not so warm, but not so cold, either. Kinda like Eli\u2019s. It\u2019s weird, getting used to that lukewarm skin. I can feel it through Noah\u2019s clothes, even. Yet I take full comfort in it right now. I slip my arms around his waist and lay my head against his rock of a chest. \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up, Poe. Even I was overpowered.\u201d He squeezes me. \u201cThat\u2019s one strong bitch. Must be old as dirt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lean back and look at him. \u201cDo you think she\u2019s controlling Eli?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s jaw tightens. His eyes are murky in the shadows of the river. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced of that, darlin\u2019. I wish I was.\u201d He sighs and crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cShe rendered me powerless back there, along with you. When you stopped, I stopped.\u201d He sighs. \u201cBut I could still see. Still hear. Still understand. And what I saw?\u201d I look at him, and he looks down at me and shakes his head. \u201cDamn, Riley. The grin on Dupr\u00e9\u2019s face, that look in his eye? Even gave me the fucking chills. She\u2019s sick powerful if she can control you, me, and Eli, all at once.\u201d</p><p>A wind gusts by, and it strikes my face and makes me squint. It\u2019s chilly, maybe midthirties. I\u2019m not uncomfortable, but I do notice the temperature. Sometimes I miss it, that very humanlike sensation of being frigidly cold and needing to bundle up and stamp my feet for warmth. Miss the absolute hell out of it.</p> <p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, though,\u201d Noah says out of the blue. \u201cI can\u2019t put a finger on it. But I feel like there\u2019s something we\u2019re not seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Eli?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He glances at me. \u201cWith all of it.\u201d He grabs me gently by my jaw, forcing me to hold his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve not been dead so long that I don\u2019t remember what it feels like to have your heart trudged on. Even if Dupr\u00e9 is being controlled by that bitch, it still pisses me off. And I\u2019m sorry you have to suffer it. You\u2019ve not been yourself since Edinburgh. Since it happened.\u201d He pulls my face closer, lowers his almost until our noses touch. \u201cI miss the old, sarcastic, mean-ass, smart-ass Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>I miss her, too. It\u2019s something that I just can\u2019t seem to help, though. Everything is darker now, since Edinburgh. Ugly dark. Coming from me, that\u2019s bad, because I\u2019ve seen the shittiest, ugliest dark there is. This tops it. But maybe I\u2019ve let it get to me. In a way I shouldn\u2019t have, I mean. Maybe that\u2019s part of what\u2019s blocking my abilities. I\u2019m so blinded by grief and fury that I\u2019m not using the extent of my tendencies. It\u2019s why that female was able to control me so thoroughly.</p><p>Maybe Noah Miles is onto something.</p> <p>He grins, still obscenely close to my face.</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019ve not even once pulled that satchel off your neck and tried to seduce me?\u201d I ask jokingly. I narrow my gaze and wait for Noah\u2019s wiseass answer.</p><p>Instead, he widens his smile, turns my face loose, and fishes out his iPhone. After a few taps, he flips it around and lowers it. My eyes scan the picture fastened there.</p><p>Me. Noah. My mouth latched on to his, sucking his face off.</p><p>Then it hits me. I remember. The forest, after I\u2019d dragged Eli and Vic out of the realm. Noah had used his oversensual vampire pheromones to lure me back to reality.</p><p>He\u2019d saved my life by doing it.</p> <p>Still. I glare at him, and punch him in the stomach. \u201cAsshole. You had to take a pic of that?\u201d I punch him again. Harder. \u201cYou literally took the time to take a pic? I was out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d Noah says, ridiculously clutching his stomach. As if that had hurt him. \u201cYou don\u2019t sincerely think I\u2019d pass up a photo op like that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me that,\u201d I say, and reach for it. He snatches it back. Lifts it out of my reach.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no, Ms. Poe. Not on your life.\u201d He grins and stuffs his iPhone deep into his pocket. \u201cTechnology is a wonderful thing. And I\u2019ve saved it to my hard drive, so stop fretting about deleting it off my cell\u2014\u201d</p><p>A sound distracts me, and I hold up my hand to silence Noah. He\u2019s listening now, too, and through the chilled night air, we both strain. I concentrate, breathe deeply, opening my senses. Closing my eyes, I zone out everything and envision my ear canal as a megaphone, siphoning all abstract noises and sharpening them. At once, I snap my gaze beyond the city lights. Up the river and higher. I strain so hard it almost hurts. Then I hear it. The slightest of sounds. It\u2019s a groggy, faint groan. Female.</p><p>Human.</p><p>And it\u2019s not a groan of pleasure.</p><p>I sniff the air, but it\u2019s too far away to tell. I can barely detect where the sound is coming from, and all I can do is start moving in that direction.</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I say, and start off at a jog.</p><p>Noah\u2019s right beside me.</p><p>At once, I stop, turn around, and take off toward the river. Within seconds, I\u2019m at a full run. The moment my boot hits the walkway hugging the river, I leap, over the water, and land in a crouch on the opposite bank. I glance behind me, just in time to see Noah land beside me. I pause and listen for a half second. We\u2019re on the same side of the river as St. Andrew\u2019s, but north of the cathedral. I turn in the direction of St. Andrew\u2019s, and slipping through the shadows, we run. It\u2019s close to two a.m. now, and patrons have thinned and humans are scarce. So the whimpering I\u2019m homing in on, growing louder by the second, worries me. We race up Duncraig Street and turn onto Kenneth, following the human\u2019s groans. I glance at Noah as we run, and I know he hears it now. There\u2019s a cemetery up ahead, the scent of aged decay penetrating my senses and drawing me closer and closer. Fearing to be noticed by anyone simply taking out the trash, I hasten down a dark alley, find my foothold, and leap up to the rooftop. When I glance to my side, Noah\u2019s there. We head across the rooftops, bounding over chimneys and slipping on tiles, until the sound of the human\u2019s heartbeat quickens. The cemetery is there, just ahead, and I pick up speed, leaping down from the roof and landing in a full run. We\u2019re still within the city limits, but the populated areas have thinned. Tomnahurich Cemetery sits on a hillside, and as we hit the single graveled lane within, it starts to wind up the hill from the bottom. I can smell old death, bones, and rotted earth. My eyes search the area in front of me, and although it\u2019s dark out, the pale gray of the headstones stands stark against the blackness of night. Graves reach all the way up to the summit, but the human\u2019s quickened heartbeat pulls me off the path and into the wood. Through the pines and brush we race, and suddenly, I pull up short. On the far side of the hill, I hear it. Gurgling. Choking.</p><p>Panicking, I take off, and Noah\u2019s keeping up step for step. I jump up and into the tree limbs overhead, and leap tree to tree to save time. Then, below and ahead, I see them. I see Eli.</p><p>And the scene stops my heart.</p><p>The female from Hush 51 stands in the clearing. Eli is a few feet away, stone-still.</p><p>In the female\u2019s arms is a young woman, the other woman\u2019s mouth latched on to her throat. The girl\u2019s arms dangle, limp and lifeless at her sides. Her body jerks, convulses. Not all the way dead yet.</p><p>In the tree, my hand is pressing hard against the rough bark. Noah\u2019s arm goes around my waist and I know he\u2019s doing that to keep me from lunging down. In my heart I know we\u2019re too late.</p><p>The woman\u2019s head lifts. Blood trails down her chin. Jesus Christ, it\u2019s a lot of blood. She\u2019s looking dead at me when she smiles. Eli continues to stand, unmoving. Frozen in place.</p><p>When my gaze moves back to the female, she throws the human down.</p><p>Like trash.</p><p>Part Four</p><p> DARK WHISPERS</p><p>Make sure when your shift is over you go home alive. Here endeth the lesson.</p><p>\u2014Jim Malone, The Untouchables, 1987</p><p>Can you imagine what it would feel like to have your heart ripped out of your chest? Like, dig their fingers into your skin, break rib bones until those fingers thread through the vessels, find and squeeze your heart, and then rip it out of your body? I can. I feel like it just happened. I don\u2019t feel human anymore. Not alive. Not dead. I don\u2019t know if I feel anything at all, other than fury. And disgust. It sounds dramatic just to think it, much less truly feel it. Right now I don\u2019t give a damn. I want to hurt. Cause pain. Maybe even kill. Now that I think about it, maybe that\u2019s what she wants.</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>They are baiting you, Riley. You must leave. Do it now.</p><p>My body jolts as though I\u2019ve been hit. I\u2019m so taken off guard by the voice in my head that I nearly fall from the twenty-foot tree branch I\u2019m sharing with Noah.</p><p>Go now. If they capture you, Riley, they won\u2019t kill you. They\u2019ll torture you. And there\u2019s nothing more you can do. The human is dead. Leave.</p><p>I stare through the pine branches and shadows at Eli and the female. My eyes drift to the lifeless body of the innocent human lying on the ground. I am so damn confused and hurt and angry, I feel as though I\u2019m going to self-combust. My breath quickens, and my energy gathers, but before my feet leave the tree branch, Noah\u2019s grip tightens around my arm. I know he won\u2019t let go. If I jump, I\u2019ll land with one less limb.</p><p>But if I jump, I\u2019ll still have one good arm left to fight with.</p><p>Then I hear it. I hold my breath and cock my head, zoning out everything else around me: the wind, the night sounds. I focus on heartbeats, separating the human ones from the animal ones. There. Back toward the river. And it\u2019s more than one, accompanied by breathlessness.</p><p>With a final glance at the female vampire, who wipes her mouth with her sleeve and grins at me, I look at Noah, and he knows. We take off through the trees, and I\u2019m racing now toward the human heart that is beating faster and faster, matching the footsteps as it runs. The moment we clear the cemetery, we\u2019re at top speed, Noah\u2019s a few steps behind me, and . . . I was wrong. Not at the river. One street over. Down an alley. The crying and begging is loud now\u2014loud enough for another human to hear. Noah and I round the corner at the same time.</p><p>It\u2019s a dead-end alley\u2014a crossway between two buildings, with a small courtyard at the very end. A young couple stands huddled together, the guy shielding the girl. She\u2019s clinging to his back, her fingers digging into his shoulder so fiercely I can see her knuckles whitening from where I stand.</p><p>Two have them cornered\u2014both males. Both young. Well, young looking. They both turn and face me and Noah as we close in. I lunge toward the couple, and the girl screams. I glance at her. Be quiet. Both of you run. Leave. Go straight home. Do it now! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The guy stares at me for a blink, then grabs his girlfriend by the hand and starts to run, and I shuffle them to the side of the building, my back to them, my eyes on the males. Noah\u2019s in front of me now, and he\u2019s already morphed. One of the males leaps and tries to get past me to go after the humans, but I grab his leg and snatch him down. He lands on his back, and I\u2019m on top of him. He surprises me, though. He\u2019s stronger than I imagine. He grabs me by the throat and flings me against the building. My head hits, and I know it\u2019s gonna hurt like hell in the morning. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Noah. He\u2019s got the other one. This one flies at me, and I yank my silver out of my waist sheath and jab the tip into his skin. His eyes grow large as he stares at me.</p><p>\u201cIs she controlling you?\u201d I ask. When he doesn\u2019t answer, I shove the blade in a little more. He grunts. \u201cWho is she?\u201d I growl. What\u2019s her fucking name?</p><p>The vampire stares at me with bloodred eyes. \u201cCarrine,\u201d he says, and his voice is gurgly sounding. A smile tips his mouth upward. \u201cShe will kill you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d I shove the blade into his heart. He falls against me. He\u2019s already convulsing when I shove him off, and the moment I\u2019m clear of him I see Noah tear the other one\u2019s head clean off. Not pretty. He throws it down onto the quivering body and looks at me. In a blurring instant, his face shifts back. Flawless and perfect.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Noah says. He glances at the piles on the ground. \u201cThis is getting pretty goddamn old.\u201d He cracks his neck, as if there\u2019s a kink left over from his monster shifting. \u201cWhat\u2019d he tell you?\u201d</p><p>I go over, kick the blade away from the messy pile of vampire leftovers, and clean it off on the pavement. Then my pants. So freaking sick, but I don\u2019t want to leave my blades behind. \u201cHer name is Carrine. And apparently, according to him\u201d\u2014I incline my head\u2014\u201cshe wants me dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s nothing new,\u201d Noah says. He glances skyward; it\u2019s the first time I notice that dawn is near. \u201cYou hear anything else?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I listen for a moment, then shake my head. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ll feel better if we run the rooftops, slip through a few streets before dawn breaks.\u201d I shove the blade back in its sheath and walk to Noah. \u201cI don\u2019t know who Carrine is, but something else is going on here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWell, if I knew that answer we wouldn\u2019t be standing here.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s face is shadowy, but I see him grin. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We head out. Run rooftops. Leap from building to building. We even cross the river, scale St. Andrew\u2019s Cathedral, and make a few laps along the river Ness. It stays silent the rest of the night. Well, all except for the fire department and clean- up crew still gathered outside Hush 51. What a mess. We keep our distance, though, and the closer it is to daylight, people are beginning their day and we\u2019re forced to slow to their pace. Nothing else occurs. No random vampires. No appearance of Eli and Carrine.</p><p>Just thinking his name with another female, vampire or not, hurts.</p><p>With Noah and me covering opposite sides of the street, we sweep the city center once more. Gulls scream and light on the rooftops, and as I inhale, the salty scent of the firth sweeps over me. Reminds me of home. God, I miss that stinky, pukey-smelling marsh.</p> <p>The next couple of days are surprisingly uneventful. No killings, not even a hint or scent of Eli and Carrine. We comb every club, seek out every rooftop, every darkened alleyway, and all along the river Ness. Nothing. The weekend is over now, and locals are returning to their weekly routine. Me and Noah are just turning onto Montague Row when the November sun peaks over the city\u2019s crest. I stop and turn, staring. Ever since I\u2019ve been in Scotland, I think I\u2019ve seen the sun maybe three times. I want so badly for all this bullshit to go away: the killing of innocents, the mystery of Eli. And how will I ever get the images of him kissing that female out of my head? Jesus, I hate jealousy, but I\u2019m human, even if just partly, after all. I can\u2019t help some emotions. And watching the two of them kiss, touch?</p><p>I close my eyes for a brief second, and the sun rises and gleams through the clouds, shining on my face. My skin heats, just a little, and I inhale. For a moment, I\u2019m lost. The sounds of the city, horns blasting, the low hum of conversation that hardly ever leaves me now. The wind is chilled and brisk this morning, and with it rides the sounds of seals barking from the firth.</p><p>I snap my eyes open, suddenly aware that I\u2019m standing on the drive of our guesthouse, with my eyes closed. Looking like an idiot. Feeling way more vulnerable than I should ever, ever allow myself.</p><p>Noah\u2019s silver eyes are studying me with such intensity, such depth. No pity there. Only compassion. His eyes soften. \u201cYou\u2019re far from looking like an idiot,\u201d he informs me, once more delving into my thoughts. \u201cFar. And don\u2019t go digging around in my head, either.\u201d He grins. \u201cYou might not like what you find.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s tempting, I\u2019ll admit. To dig, I mean. Ever since all of the vampiric venom latched on to my DNA, I\u2019ve been able to see past events in others\u2019 lives. All by a simple touch. I don\u2019t have any control over where I go once inside that soul\u2019s memory, but it\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m actually there, in person, standing and watching whatever event is occurring unfold. The guys who schooled us all in the use of a broadsword back in Edinburgh? Tristan de Barre in particular? Yeah, that was definitely something else to behold. He\u2019d been a thirteenth-century knight who was murdered in his own dungeon, along with his men, the infamous Dragonhawk and his knights. In the vision I\u2019d stood in a dank cell and watched, helpless to do anything about it. Then again, had I been able to, there\u2019d be no Tristan de Barre today. And weirdly, although he was dead for centuries, there is a Tristan. Dead, wandering his lands with his men as spirits, then whack! His now wife, a forensic archaeologist, helped him break an aged curse, and he and his men were given another life. Another chance at mortality. Tristan and Gawan Conwyk, friends in life and in death, came together to instruct the WUP team in Edinburgh on the use of a broadsword. Sick teachers, both of them.</p><p>\u201cNow, there\u2019s something I don\u2019t see nearly enough of lately,\u201d Noah says as he unlocks the guesthouse door. He turns. \u201cYou, smiling.\u201d</p><p>I walk past him. \u201cYeah, well, you know me, don\u2019t ya?\u201d I move into the kitchen, open the fridge, and grab the half-filled soda bottle Noah had bought for me the other day. When I crack the lid, it barely hisses; it\u2019s flatter than what I like, but I guzzle it down anyway.</p><p>\u201cAll too well.\u201d</p> <p>I look at Noah, and for a split second I think to tell him about the voice I\u2019d heard, warning me to leave instead of attack Carrine. The voice telling me that she and Eli would not kill, but would torture me. I open my mouth, but something else comes out instead. \u201cI don\u2019t get this, Noah. What do Carrine and Eli have to do with the rogue and newblood killings? I don\u2019t see the connection at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, either,\u201d he offers. \u201cBut that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to find out, right? And to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are,\u201d I answer. Then I throw the empty plastic soda bottle at the trash can. I throw it harder than I mean to, and I completely miss the can and hit the wall instead. It bounces and flings across the kitchen. I sigh and rub my eyes.</p><p>Noah grabs me by the shoulders and steadies me. Calms me. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he says.</p><p>With another sigh, I open my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, Noah. How can Eli look right at me and not know me?\u201d I feel energy surging up inside me from the thought of Eli and the female together. Like a soda that has been shaken, and the lid is cracked and all the liquid fizzes out. That\u2019s me, right now, despite having seen the hesitation in Eli\u2019s eyes. Almost there . . .</p><p>\u201cRiley, you have to get a grip, darlin\u2019,\u201d Noah says, and ducks his head to make me look at him. Liquid silver glimmers. \u201cBecause, when we have human bloodlust, that\u2019s all there is. It consumes us. No matter what\u2019s occurred, that becomes the focus. To somehow, no matter the means, get that human\u2019s blood inside our bodies.\u201d</p><p>I look away, because it hurts to think about this. He grasps my chin and pulls my gaze back to his. \u201cAll reason, morality, humanity\u2014it all goes away. Memories? Gone. Our vision sees nothing but blood. We taste it in our mouth by just the scent of it beneath the surface of a human\u2019s skin.\u201d He smiles. \u201cYou know this. You experienced it, Riley. I\u2019ve got the memory of a sore neck to prove it. Remember? You ripped into it when you were blood-lusting.\u201d</p><p>Again, the need for comfort overwhelms me, and I slide my arms around Noah\u2019s waist and lay my head against his chest. I\u2019m not very fond of this neediness I have lately. It sucks. Makes me feel so useless.</p><p>His arms go around me, and his hand cups the back of my head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie and say I got all the answers,\u201d he says gently. \u201cBut I will fight to the end to save Eli.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s at that exact moment, it happens.</p><p>It\u2019s weird that it hasn\u2019t happened before now.</p><p>One moment, my cheek is pressed against Noah\u2019s chest; in the next second, I\u2019m standing in a mist-shrouded forest, the white vapor slipping through tall trees and underbrush. I look around me; nothing looks familiar. Ravens startle and fly away in a rush overhead. I glance around. At first, I see no one. Then I hear footfalls. Running. Breaking through brush.</p><p>Then I see Noah. He\u2019s on foot, running through the trees. He\u2019s wearing brown pants, boots, a cream-colored long-sleeved shirt, and a brown vest. His hair is different\u2014long, gathered at the nape of his neck, no dreads. He wears a tricorn hat, and is hauling ass. In one hand, a hatchet. The other, a rifle. Three men in red coats are chasing him.</p><p>Revolutionary War. Noah is a militiaman.</p><p>A shot rings out through the wood, and when I look at the redcoats, one of their rifles is smoking. The other two fire at Noah. One misses. One hits him in the shoulder, knocking him sideways and down. I fight not to run to him; it will do no good. I\u2019m a bystander, watching a memory that\u2019s already happened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just as fast as he fell, Noah rolls and gets back up. He\u2019s now rounded and running directly toward the redcoats. All three are on their knees reloading their guns. Noah throws down his gun and with a wide arc, swings and sinks his hatchet right into the British soldier\u2019s chest. With his foot, he shoves the soldier off the blade and runs right at the other two. Blood is oozing from Noah\u2019s shoulder, but he ignores it and takes a lethal swing at the first soldier\u2019s throat. His head nearly comes clean off.</p><p>One redcoat left, and he\u2019s waiting for Noah and uses his gun to reflect Noah\u2019s powerful swing. The two fight, struggle. It\u2019s only now that I realize Noah\u2019s not a vampire. He\u2019s mortal. Impressive fighter. I can feel his rising adrenaline as the pair struggle to gain control.</p><p>Out of nowhere, another redcoat appears, and with a sword drawn, he runs it straight through Noah\u2019s back. Noah\u2019s scream pierces my ears, and every ounce of pain and anger coursing through him, I feel inside me. He sinks to his knees, his hand still tightly gripping his hatchet.</p> <p>From the canopy above, a figure falls from the mist. The moment he drops and lands on his feet, I see it\u2019s Eli. He\u2019s dressed like Noah. His hair is longer, pulled back at the nape of his neck. His cerulean blue eyes almost glow through the mist.</p><p>In a blur, Eli moves, and he is suddenly at both men. He grabs one redcoat by the throat. The other, by the front of his shirt, and pulls him close. As I watch, Eli\u2019s jaw extends, his teeth drop long and jagged from his gums, and he rips into the soldier\u2019s throat. He throws him down and does the same to the second redcoat. The bloodlust that rushes through Eli also rushes through me; I can feel it, the scent, the craving, almost as if I were experiencing it instead of him. Motionless, I stand there and watch as Eli drops to the forest floor to Noah. Eli\u2019s no longer morphed as a vampire. He\u2019s Eli. And I can see pain etched into his features as he stares at Noah.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t make it,\u201d Noah says. His accent is still tinged with Southern drawl, but it\u2019s older. \u201cFind Elana. Take\u2014\u201d Noah starts coughing, choking. He grabs Eli\u2019s arm. \u201cTake care of her, brother. I promised her I would care for her always. I . . . have to break this promise.\u201d He coughs some more, and it\u2019s more of a crying cough than anything else. It\u2019s filled with pain. Not physical pain, but emotional. I feel it inside me, too. \u201cDo this for me,\u201d he begs Eli. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>All of Noah\u2019s emotions run through me. He loves this girl, Elana. Was it his wife? His fianc\u00e9e? Either way, the sorrow he\u2019s experiencing is mind-numbing. It\u2019s a different Noah than I know. I watch as Eli lowers his head closer to Noah\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI can fix this,\u201d Eli says. \u201cI can fix you. You can take care of Elana yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Noah\u2019s breathing quickens, and he chokes.</p><p>\u201cYou must hurry and decide,\u201d Eli urges. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be like you?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Noah closes his eyes for a moment, and his lips are moving. He\u2019s praying. Suddenly, his eyes open again and he\u2019s staring at Eli. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>Eli doesn\u2019t ask if he\u2019s sure; nor does he hesitate, not even for a second. He moves so fast I don\u2019t see Eli\u2019s face change. Don\u2019t see his teeth elongate. I only see his mouth move over Noah\u2019s throat and stay there for several seconds. When his head lifts, and he wipes his mouth across his sleeve, his face is Eli\u2019s. Not vampire. Noah is deathly still. I see no breath rising in his chest. His mercury-colored eyes stare blankly skyward.</p> <p>Suddenly, Noah jerks, his body begins to quiver, convulse. Eli grasps his shoulders, holds him down. \u201cBe strong,\u201d Eli growls, and his French accent is heavier now.</p><p>Noah\u2019s painful scream rips through the misty forest. Then his eyes flicker open.</p><p>Voices, footfalls in the forest. Eli\u2019s gaze snaps up, his hands still holding a now-ferocious and fighting Noah down. It\u2019s like . . . he\u2019s crazed, and those emotions soar within me, too. I can barely stand still.</p><p>I look in the direction Eli\u2019s staring, and I see what he sees. More redcoats. A lot of them. Like a rag doll, he throws Noah over his shoulder and starts to run. I try to move, to follow, but I can\u2019t. Moments later, the British soldiers rush by me. They\u2019re so close I can see the whiskers on their faces. They\u2019re chasing Eli and Noah, and before long, the mist swallows them all up. Gunshots ring through the air. Screams. Terrified screams\u2014</p><p>Suddenly, my eyes snap open, and Noah\u2019s shaking the holy hell out of my shoulders. So hard I feel like my teeth are clanking against one another. I focus on his face, his eyes. \u201cStop shaking me,\u201d I say.</p><p>Noah\u2019s jaw clenches. \u201cI could\u2019ve used my special method of pulling you from your mind explorations,\u201d he answers. His eyes lighten. \u201cThe one I reserve only for you.\u201d</p><p>He leads me to a chair and I sit. He squats down in front of me, and I look at him. \u201cYou never told me Eli is the one who turned you.\u201d</p><p>A smile tips his mouth. \u201cYou never asked. So what else did you see?\u201d</p> <p>I inhale, exhale, and look at him. \u201cI saw you fighting British soldiers. But you were dying. Pleading with Eli to take care of Elana.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Noah\u2019s mind goes elsewhere, and I know this because the look in his eyes softens and deepens and he stares away at some other point in the room. He finally looks back at me. \u201cWe were engaged to be married. She was . . . the sweetest woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask. \u201cAfter Eli changed you.\u201d</p><p>Noah rubs his jaw, and I can tell it\u2019s painful to recall the memories. I regret asking. \u201cYou know how it is when you\u2019re first changed. You\u2019re . . . out of your mind with bloodlust.\u201d A smile touches his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t remember everything, but Eli later told me I gave him a helluva ride. He took me all the way south, to Preacher\u2019s kin. He left me there for them to cleanse me. The same way you were. Hasn\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d</p><p>I hesitate to ask more, but I might as well. Noah\u2019s my partner. My friend. Eli\u2019s best friend. I want to know. \u201cWhat happened to Elana?\u201d</p><p>Noah looks down at the floor between his knees. \u201cBy the time Eli made it back to watch over her until I was ready, she and her whole family had been killed.\u201d He looks up at me now, and his liquid silver eyes are watery. \u201cElana, her parents, and six brothers and sisters. All dead. Their house had been burned to the ground.\u201d He rises and walks to the window and looks out. \u201cI . . . went nuts for a while. A controlled rampage, you might say.\u201d He turns and looks at me. \u201cIt started out that way, anyhow. Revenge, I assure you, can quickly turn into bloodlust. Eli had to come after me. I had to go through vampire detox once more.\u201d His eyes aren\u2019t sad now, but he\u2019s not smiling. \u201cI avenged Elana and her family. But it was almost at too high a price. If Eli hadn\u2019t stopped me . . .\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Riley. I\u2019m pretty sure you and I wouldn\u2019t be sharing the same guesthouse if it hadn\u2019t been for Dupr\u00e9\u2019s determination to save me from myself.\u201d</p><p>I punch Noah in the arm. \u201cDamn glad he did, then. There\u2019s no one else, except Eli, that I\u2019d want watching my back.\u201d</p><p>We stand there in that little Inverness guesthouse kitchen, and we\u2019re silent for only a handful of seconds. But we know each other. We understand. And I understand a little more about the predicament Eli is in right now.</p><p>Noah\u2019s fingers lightly grasp my chin and pull my gaze to his. His eyes search mine for a few moments. \u201cI know Eli better than anyone, Riley. He\u2019s a strong-willed soul. He\u2019ll come out of this. I swear I feel it.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s encouraging words wash over me, and I\u2019m soothed. I smile at him. \u201cI needed that.\u201d</p><p>His perfect lips pull back into a wide smile. \u201cI know.\u201d He kisses my nose. \u201cAll right, enough mind-diving for now,\u201d Noah says. \u201cWe got work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I told you I had no control over where the memories take me,\u201d I remind him. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to wait and see what it is you\u2019re hiding from me later.\u201d</p><p>Something stirs in Noah\u2019s eye, but I ignore it. No need to goad him.</p><p>\u201cSmart girl,\u201d he says.</p><p>We get busy.</p><p>As we study the city map, I circle all of the most likely places a rogue or newblood would hunt. But as I stare at my markings, it starts to all seem useless. The red permanent marker I\u2019m using starts to take up a lot of space. I shake my head, snap the pen lid back on, and throw it down. \u201cTheir attacks are too random, Noah. We\u2019re chasing too many directions. Too many damn what-ifs.\u201d I look up at him, and his eyes are glued to the map. \u201cI feel like the only thing we\u2019re doing is running on my supersonic senses. So far, it hasn\u2019t been a hundred percent on the mark, either. Carrine has been able to control my mind, and she\u2019s killed an innocent before I had a chance to pick up on it.\u201d</p><p>He looks up at me now. \u201cShe controlled your mind, and mine, because she\u2019s strong as shit, Riley. Plus, you\u2019re distracted by Eli. We\u2019re not seeing it, but somehow it\u2019s all tied in together. Carrine, Eli, and the random kills.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cWe need to find out more about her.\u201d He pushes away from the table and grabs his cell off the counter.</p><p>\u201cWho ya calling?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d he answers. \u201cHe\u2019s been in Scotland a long time. Maybe he\u2019s heard of her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel not only has no last name to mention, but he\u2019s an immortal druid from centuries ago. He\u2019s WUP\u2019s Scotland contact. We stayed at his place, the Crescent, back in Edinburgh when we fought the Black Fallen. It\u2019d be nice to have him here.</p><p>As Noah talks to Gabriel, I get up, nod toward my bedroom, and head to the shower. My body aches, and the beginning of a headache is nagging at the base of my skull. In my room I dig through my meager belongings\u2014just the bare necessities, I guess. I grab clean panties and a cotton camisole and head to the shower. Once in the bathroom, though, I stare at the large porcelain claw-foot bathtub just a little too long. I decide to soak. Think. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Forget.</p><p>Turning the water on full-blast hot, I undress and wait for the tub to fill.

He saved my life, all of our lives, by submitting his own. What are you doing slipping around my bathroom while I bathe? I ask.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to get you alone these days. Forgive me for indulging in your beauty. \u2019Tis all I have left.</p><p>Who is the female? Carrine? I ask.</p><p>She\u2019s apparently someone who wants your fianc\u00e9 just as badly as you do.</p><p>That angers me. Damn it, Athios. Are you going to help me or not?</p><p>He laughs softly, almost a whisper. You ask much of me, Riley Poe.</p><p>Yeah, I know. I\u2019m sorry, Athios. I wish there was a way you could escape . . . wherever you are.</p> <p>Athios sighs. What would the difference be? I\u2019m in here without you, or out there, without you? Same prison to me.</p><p>I love Eli, and that\u2019s never going to change. I have to help him.</p><p>I know. Which is why I even bother putting myself through this torture. To see you like you are, in my head, and know you\u2019re unobtainable. I\u2019d rather be sliced in half.</p><p>Athios.</p><p>Another laugh. I\u2019ll see what I can find out. Mind combing is a tedious endeavor, you know. And it\u2019s all I have at the moment. I\u2019m bound here, in this place, Riley. And I don\u2019t know Carrine, except, of course, what she is. And that she\u2019s very, very powerful.</p><p>I know. With a wave of her hand she caused some sort of a sonic boom in the club we were in. Blew out all of the glass. I had no power against her</p><p>Well, keep in mind that powers of the mind must be practiced, just as one practices swordplay. Practice on your partner. You\u2019ve not even scratched the surface of your capabilities, Riley. Remember. Besides your own unique blood, you have all that vampiric venom floating about in you. I\u2019ve seen your powers. They\u2019re only half developed.</p><p>I smile. Is this a pep talk, Athios? Something to lift my spirits?</p> <p>You aren\u2019t hearing me, are you? Whilst you may have pushed aside our time together, I most certainly have not. It\u2019s all I have, those memories.</p><p>Guilt washes over me. Yes. I admit there was something between Athios and me. Something strong and powerful that I could not fight. We made love, after I thought Eli had been killed. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve had to come to terms with. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t regret. And if I ever get Eli back to Eli, I will have to tell him. Hell, he may even already know.</p><p>It soothes my soul to know you at least don\u2019t regret our time together. But my point is, Riley, that you have a little Black Fallen in you, too. Along with all of the vampiric abilities. You\u2019ve simply ignored it. And unfortunately, I cannot help you. Only you can bring them to light.</p><p>I close my eyes, and let my head drop against the hard porcelain tub. I purposely knock it a few times. And I groan. I feel like I\u2019m talking to Yoda. In riddles. What are you talking about, Athios?</p><p>Who is Yoda?</p><p>I almost laugh. No one. Just tell me what you mean instead of talking in circles.</p><p>You have a few of my abilities inside you, Riley. When we made love, we became one, even for a brief bit of time. I left inside you a piece of me. My skills of the mind. Core energy that you can command. And perhaps a few powers that can help you manipulate the elements. Forces of nature. You can use them to fight Carrine, or anyone else who poses a threat. Hone them. Use them. I must go. If I\u2019m caught, I may lose this. And I can\u2019t survive without at least speaking to you every now and then. I\u2019ll see what I can find out about Carrine. Watch your back. Stay close to Miles.</p><p>I will.</p><p>Just that fast, I know Athios is gone, out of my head. I can sense his presence is no longer there. I can\u2019t explain it, but I\u2019m left with a sense of loss. Not the same loss that I feel with Eli, though.</p><p>That\u2019s becoming more and more unbearable.</p><p>Reaching up, I turn the hot water back on and let it heat the lukewarm water I\u2019m sitting in. I rest my head back and close my eyes. Just a few more minutes.</p><p>My thoughts drift to Athios\u2019s words. I have Black Fallen traits now, too? That he left them inside me is . . . freakishly weird. Stronger mind control and power over the elements? Core energy? I\u2019m like one of the fucking X-Men. What the hell?</p><p>Technically, Athios isn\u2019t a Black Fallen. He\u2019s not evil. And he sacrificed his soul to save mankind. But he\u2019s one powerful angel. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine grazing that kind of power. I don\u2019t want such intense mind power. What if it takes over me and I become some power-hungry half human hell-bent on revenge, throwing hurricanes and tornadoes at people? There\u2019re enough of those in the world. I\u2019m not going to become one of them.</p><p>Hell no.</p><p>The hot water envelopes me, and I feel myself drifting. I don\u2019t really want to\u2014we\u2019ve got work to do. But drowsiness overcomes me, and I slip into a quiet peace that I haven\u2019t had in some time.</p><p>At first, I\u2019m conscious of lying in the tub, hot water soothing my aching muscles and bare skin. Then it grows dark behind my eyelids, and I see nothing, I feel nothing. I lose the sensation of being submerged in hot water, and it\u2019s replaced by cold, blackness. My arms are weightless, probing into the murky surroundings like a mindless, rambling zombie with its arms held out before it.</p><p>Then, as if my thoughts have lit some sort of inner fire, adrenaline surges through me, and I feel energy gathering from my core. At first, it swirls there, like a satellite hurricane photo. Then it fires, explodes, sending lethal doses of that energy through my limbs. I jerk awake, almost leaping from my confinement. I land on my feet, crouching. Slowly, I stand. I\u2019m no longer naked. But not dressed. Not like I normally am. It\u2019s almost like a bolt of the softest, gauziest material is clinging to my body, hovering close but unrestrained by straps or zippers or buttons. None of this do I see. I only feel it.</p><p>The power that soars through me doesn\u2019t escape; it\u2019s here, inside me, like a low-humming frequency. If a bug flew at me and hit my body it would zap and fry, bursting into flames, just like a bug lamp. Darkness still surrounds me. I\u2019m totally lost, and I don\u2019t feel anyone else\u2019s presence here but mine. Like I\u2019m in some weird time warp, floating around. Like Dr. Who. Except he\u2019s way more cool.</p><p>I lift my hand to push my hair from my face, and that same surge of power burns in the pit of my stomach, then shoots in a rush through my arm. I feel it clear to my fingertips. What the freak?</p><p>I lift my arms up simultaneously; the power surge that rips from both of my hands nearly knocks me off my feet.</p><p>Is this what Athios was talking about?</p><p>I feel like Patrick Swayze in the movie Ghost, trying to move the penny after he\u2019s dead. Pulling the energy from my core and rocking it out of my body.</p><p>Do I really have that in me? Or am I just dreaming?</p><p>It\u2019s then I feel the atmosphere around me shift, and I\u2019m weightless once more. Darkness still surrounds me, and yet something incredibly familiar overcomes me; I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a sensation, or a memory, or what. But it\u2019s something I know very, very well. I\u2019m actually starting to get pissed off. Am I in the goddamn bathtub or a dream? Loss of control now replaces that surge of power I felt moments before. I have control over nothing. I feel as though I\u2019m crammed in a recessed hole in the wall: cold, dank, spaceless. I can\u2019t turn my head; I can\u2019t move my limbs. I don\u2019t think I have any clothes on now, no gauze, nothing.</p><p>The brush of a caress grazes my waist, my hips, and the familiarity of the touch knocks the breath out of me. I crave it now, and although I can\u2019t see it, I want it.</p><p>Invisible hands move over me, and heat trails the caresses, almost uncomfortably. I can\u2019t move, although I want to; I can only stand here and receive. A grip moves through my hair, pulls it back enough to tilt my head. The touch is erotic, exciting, and my heart pounds, slowly but hard. Lips brush over mine, moist, full, seductive all at once. The sensation moves to my throat, across my collarbone, while hands cover my breasts. Arousal soars through every nerve ending in my body, and a silent moan is swallowed by the deepening of this strange, weightless kiss. Hands leave my breasts and move over my ribs, and strong fingers dig into my flesh as the kiss consumes me. I know it, this mouth. I can\u2019t place it. I only know I have to have it.</p><p>Those strong fingers ease from my hips and move down, over my thighs, and then, without warning, slide between my legs. I\u2019m caressed there, right there, a seductive touch by an invisible hand, directed by someone who knows me, knows my needs and exactly how much pressure it takes to bring me to my knees. It makes my head spin, that sexual touch, and I gasp for air as the first wave of orgasm ripples through me. Then a heated breath replaces gentle, strong fingers, and that surge of power, that orgasm, crashes over me in tumultuous waves, and I feel myself slipping.</p><p>At once, I\u2019m knocked backward, almost painfully, and my eyes jerk open. The water in the bathtub is cold; my body temperature has lowered. I\u2019m in the guesthouse. Inverness.</p><p>My gaze lifts, and from the corner, a figure emerges from the walls. He stares back at me.</p><p>Eli.</p><p>For a moment, our gazes are locked. Wordless.</p><p>His pupils dilate, fixing on mine. He knows me. I can sense it.</p><p>\u201cDo it, Eli. Do it now,\u201d a female voice commands. Carrine.</p><p>He hesitates; then his features harden. His face shakes, blurs, morphs.</p><p>And he lunges for me.</p><p>I scream, not a girly, terrified scream, but one of anger, of hurt. Of self-preservation. He\u2019s above me, though, so fast I don\u2019t even see him move until he\u2019s right at me. His hands go around my throat and he squeezes, thrusts my head under the water. I hold my breath and my eyes are open as I struggle. I see his face, all morphed and horrible, hovering just above the surface. My arms and legs flail. Jesus, he\u2019s going to drown me. Where\u2019s Carrine? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then something grips me. Inside. Athios\u2019s words. I focus, forcing all of my anger and desperation to one location in my body, at the very core. It bursts free, and I surge out of the water at him. He\u2019s back against the wall now, and he lunges at me. I\u2019ve never seen him so . . . horrifying. Just as we meet, he\u2019s gone. I hit the wall. He has totally vanished.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s here now, and he\u2019s grabbed a towel and draped it over me. I\u2019m lying on the floor, crumpled. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks. He lifts me, towel mostly wrapped around my naked body, and carries me to my bed. Laying me down, he follows me, his head bent over close enough that his dreads drop against my chest. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Noah\u2019s voice is angry, raspy, and his eyes flash fear.</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cIt was Eli,\u201d I say. A lump forms in my throat, and I swallow past it. \u201cHe was there. Then . . . Carrine commanded him to kill me. He hesitated, Noah. He knew me. I could see it in his eyes.\u201d At least, I think he did. And I think he was there.</p><p>Was he? Really?</p><p>\u201cRiley, Eli\u2019s not a ghost,\u201d Noah says. He grabs my chin and looks me over, brushing a fingertip over my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re scraped,\u201d he says. \u201cI walked in just as you leaped from the tub. No one else was in here but me.\u201d His eyebrows pull together. \u201cWhat else happened?\u201d</p><p>I stare at the ceiling and exhale. \u201cI had . . . an experience.\u201d</p><p>Noah waits.</p> <p>So, I semi-explain, leaving out the mind-numbing orgasm part.</p><p>I tell him everything else. Including my convo with Athios.</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes harden. \u201cSo you\u2019re dreaming of Eli killing you? And you have fallen angel traits cooking inside you, along with all the other venom that\u2019s making you crazy?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThis is fucked-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure that was a dream, Noah,\u201d I say, and clutching the blanket to my chest, I sit up. \u201cI was wide awake when I came out of that . . . bizarre state of existence. I looked around, knew I was in a bath of cold water, knew I was here, in this guesthouse, in Inverness.\u201d I grab his hand, and it\u2019s clenched into a fist. \u201cIt\u2019s like . . . Eli was part of the wall, part of the wainscoting. He\u201d\u2014I shake my head, dredging up the picture of it\u2014\u201cemerged from the wood. Almost like, I don\u2019t know. He was camouflaged or something.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s disturbing eyes study me with severe intensity. \u201cWas your sex dream with him?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I really have to think about it, and I hate that. \u201cI thought it was him,\u201d I answer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see a thing. Total pitch-black darkness. But in my heart, I felt it was him.\u201d I glance toward the en suite bathroom, and I envision the corner from which Eli emerged. \u201cNow I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I climb from the bed, my arms holding the towel against my body, and I walk to the window and pull the drapes back. Something has propelled me to do this, and I have no clue what. But I do it. It\u2019s midday, but the sun has disappeared, leaving the sandstone buildings and gray stone in a murky, dreamlike frame. Pedestrians are walking along the sidewalk in front of the guesthouse. My eyes drift across the street, where a single figure stands out and catches my eye. Female. Wearing a hooded jacket. Dressed in all black. I can\u2019t see her face.</p><p>I don\u2019t need to.</p><p>The building she\u2019s leaning against blurs, and the figure blends into it. Or disappears. One second, there. The next, gone.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Noah\u2019s now at my side, looking out of the window, too. But I know he doesn\u2019t see what I just saw.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>Tell him what you see, Riley.</p> <p>I close my eyes, and the motion makes my chest rise, fall, and it hurts. I feel pain inside my chest.</p><p>Go on. Tell him. He wants an answer. Give it.</p><p>The words are cold, and I can\u2019t help shivering. I continue to stare out the window.</p><p>And just in case you\u2019re completely blind, he wants to fuck you, too. Always has. He thinks about it constantly. I\u2019m surprised at his control.</p><p>I shake off his words and just breathe. \u201cCarrine is stalking me.\u201d</p><p>Noah grabs me by the shoulders and turns me around. His face is hard as he stares down at me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I stare up at him, unable to answer at first. Inside, my stomach is flipping around like I\u2019m on a fast-as-hell roller coaster, unable to stop.</p><p>You didn\u2019t think that fucking angel was the only soul who could get inside your head, did you, Riley? You think because you fucked him, you have his powers, too? I\u2019m here now. We\u2019ll see just how strong you really are. Imagine someone cutting open your skull and stuffing a live beetle inside, then sewing you back up. Imagine those tiny little feet scratching back and forth, back and forth, over your brain and bones until you begin clawing at your scalp, ripping open those stitches just to pull that beetle out. To make the insanity go away. It\u2019s going nowhere. That sensation is me, Riley. And I can\u2019t wait to show you a few things.</p><p>Only the violent shaking of my shoulders brings my vision into focus, and I stare blankly into Noah\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on, Riley?\u201d he yells. His fingers are digging into my biceps now. Painfully so.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve felt fear. I feel it now.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d Noah yells again.</p><p>She\u2019s laughing inside my head now, and she won\u2019t stop. I drop my hands from my towel and clutch the sides of my head. I push\u2014hard. My eyes squeeze tightly shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Carrine,\u201d I say without looking at Noah. \u201cShe\u2019s inside my head now. She won\u2019t . . . get out. Laughing, egging me on. I can\u2019t take it, Noah\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then, at once, she\u2019s gone. Just like that. My vision, my mind, is completely clear now. Free of the torture. Free of the bugs.</p><p>Noah\u2019s hand lifts, and I only now notice he\u2019s grabbed my towel off the floor and is lifting it back to cover me up. With one hand he holds the towel in place, and with his free hand he uses his thumb to wipe at my cheeks. Only then do I notice the tears that have started streaming from my eyes.</p><p>He sighs and pulls me against him, and I let him. His lips press against my temple. \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing to you, girl?\u201d he says against my skin. \u201cWhat the hell is she doing to you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m thinking clearly now. I hate it, but I am. Part of me wishes I could just stay suspended in some kind of weird dreamlike state\u2014a fantasy world where everything was right, going my way, and I was the winner.</p><p>That\u2019s not my reality anymore.</p><p>I look at Noah, and the care in his eyes almost pains me.</p><p>Almost as much what I have to say out loud. Just thinking the words rips into my heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to kill them, Noah,\u201d I say.</p><p>Noah just stares at me. Speechless.</p><p>My voice almost doesn\u2019t sound like it belongs to me. Sounds like someone else speaking. It quivers, breaks. More tears spill. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to kill Carrine and Eli.\u201d</p><p>Part Five</p><p>THE NESS BOYS</p><p>But there\u2019s many a slip twixt the cup and the lip.</p><p>\u2014William H. Bonney, Young Guns, 1988</p><p>I\u2019m not one who usually exhibits much control, but I\u2019ve sincerely tried to respect Riley and stay out of her head. I have now failed. It\u2019s been nearly impossible. So I have brushed off my failure and entered. What I see there scares me. The odds have changed drastically now. With Riley\u2019s heart and her brain colliding, the outcome cannot possibly be a good one. There has to be an intervention. No matter the cost. Her life is at stake, as well as what little humanity is left in her. Even I can see that. And I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make it right. Even if it means starting a vampiric war of epic proportions. Nothing and no one matters to me except Riley. Nothing.</p><p>\u2014Victorian Arcos</p><p>Noah stands with his back to me while I dress. Surprising, I know, because twice today he\u2019s seen me buck-ass naked. I guess the decency in the core of his soul rose above the perverted, sexually charged vampire in him.</p><p>\u201cNot my fault you can\u2019t keep your naked parts covered, Riley,\u201d he offers. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make me a pervert. Not really.\u201d</p><p>Trying to make light of the situation, no doubt. I try really hard to put Carrine\u2019s words about Noah aside, but it\u2019s hard. I can read minds, too. And yeah, I\u2019m not an idiot. Noah isn\u2019t only just a powerful vampire with the trait of severe seduction. At his core, he\u2019s a man. I\u2019m a woman. He\u2019s attracted to me. And I\u2019d be a liar if I didn\u2019t say he\u2019s not sexually enticing. But my love for Eli has always doused that in me. There\u2019s no one I want more than Eli. I want him back the way he was when I first met him. Not this monster he\u2019s become. Even if Carrine is controlling him. How much of Eli is left? Anyway, not once have I ever felt threatened by Noah Miles. Just the opposite. He\u2019s placed nobility and a vow to keep me safe over any sexual tension he may feel. That takes strength of crazy proportion. Especially for a vampire.</p><p>Thoughts are crashing over me like violent waves, even as I pull on my clothes. Confusion rocks me, and I can promise you, I don\u2019t like feeling out of control. Oh, hell no. Too many years spent like that. Now I like total control. Of myself. My thoughts.</p><p>But now someone else has been pulling the strings to my brain. Carrine and Eli. The other half of me.</p><p>The half I have to kill in order to survive.</p><p>I just can\u2019t believe it\u2019s come to this. I\u2019d rather Eli had stayed . . . Jesus Christ, I can\u2019t even think it. Would I have rather he stayed in that alternative realm? How can all this be happening?</p><p>After yanking a black ribbed tank over my head, I pull on a pair of low-rider army green cargos and button the fly. My hair is still wet and hanging in dripping hunks, trailing water down my back, when a knock sounds at the door. Noah and I share a look, and he moves so fast his form is nothing but a blur. Seconds later, the front door creaks as he opens it. Voices. Slightly familiar. I hurry down the hall and round the foyer.</p><p>Just as I step into view, my eyes collide with Rhine\u2019s. The young lead singer and bass player from the street, from Hush 51. All of the band members are now trailing in behind Rhine, and stand in a half circle in the living room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guys find out where we\u2019re staying?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Rhine\u2019s gaze latches on to my arm with the dragon inked into it. A slight smile touches his lips before he looks at me. \u201cWe\u2019ve come tae help.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Noah, who is leaning against the doorjamb, arms crossed over his chest. He looks at me and gives a slight shrug. I step closer to Rhine, give the others a brief once-over, then look back into the young guy\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhat do you mean, help us? What is it you think we need help with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOch, gel,\u201d Rhine answers with a grin. A glint of mischief lights his green eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at wha\u2019 we could help ya wi\u2019. Sort of how ya helped us all quit smokin\u2019. How ya saved all those people at Hush 51.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. An\u2019 how ya can run like the devil,\u201d Pete says. A grin slashes across white teeth. One eyebrow lifts.</p><p>I narrow my gaze.</p><p>\u201cDo ya ken where ya are, lass?\u201d Rhine says with a very appealing grin. \u201cYou\u2019re in the bloody Highlands. \u2019Tis no surprise tae any o\u2019 us that your mate here is a bloodsucker, although it took us a while tae figure it out. Not like us tae take so long.\u201d Rhine cocks his head and studies me. \u201cYou\u2019re . . . somethin\u2019 altogether different, though.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m staring at Rhine, and I gotta admit, he\u2019s . . . impressive. Young, but pretty stable. Solid and cut, like he works out. No skully today, and his close-cut dark hair and flawless complexion make those green eyes and dark lashes definite eye- catchers. His smile widens, as if he can read my thoughts.</p> <p>Impossible.</p><p>I focus. Just to be sure.</p><p>Nope. Total, one hundred percent mortal.</p><p>Noah chuckles.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened back at the club? I watched. Saw the whole bloody exchange between you and that bloodsucker bitch,\u201d Rhine said. \u201cFroze me solid, she did, but I could still see.\u201d He laughs, and it\u2019s a deep, scratchy, sexy sound. \u201cShe ain\u2019t the first one we\u2019ve seen, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we know that\u2019s who\u2019s behind the murders here,\u201d Gerry says. He\u2019s the shyest of the bunch, I\u2019d have to say. Wide brown eyes and dark close-clipped hair, his face baby-soft flawless, his voice soft. But when he speaks, it\u2019s listen-worthy. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen plenty.\u201d He grins slightly.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve killed plenty, too,\u201d Tate adds. Not the shy one, I notice, and a little husky. Maybe even the class clown. His wavy auburn hair flips over his ears and his eyes are the color of dark honey. And from the size of him I believe he can kick some serious ass.</p><p>\u201cAye, and it\u2019s been quiet for a while. Until you showed up,\u201d Rhine says. \u201cFancy that.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as Rhine and I hold a stare-down. His gaze is locked on to mine. \u201cYou think we\u2019re killers?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Rhine doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYou\u2019d be dead as dust if we did.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a little tension in the room. More from me than anyone else, I imagine. I don\u2019t like a threat. I don\u2019t like a pack of young human hunters sniffing us out, either. I guess I\u2019d been so consumed with Eli and the female, and the other killings, that I\u2019d totally misjudged Rhine and his friends. Even more so than simply thinking they were thugs.</p><p>They\u2019re goddamn hunters.</p><p>I\u2019m staring at Rhine, still trying to wrap my brain around it all, when Noah speaks.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to babysit,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Just that fast, Rhine whips out a silver blade and is holding it against Noah\u2019s throat. The others all have similar blades in the hands.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I\u2019ll give Noah Miles some cred. He doesn\u2019t morph. He remains totally calm. But I can see inside his head. Ri, this little prick has a fucking silver blade at my neck. Wanna get him off?</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019ll get him off, Miles. Gotta hand it to him, though. He\u2019s pretty quick. Might use him and the guys after all. And he\u2019s not so little.</p><p>Get him off now, Poe. I don\u2019t want to have to kill him.</p><p>I focus on Rhine, then the guys. Drop your silver, boys.</p><p>The clap of blades hitting the hardwood floor resounds in the room. Noah moves to stand beside me. It all happens so fast the guys\u2019 puzzled faces are almost comical.</p><p>Rhine gives me a nod. \u201cAye, like I said. You\u2019re somethin\u2019 altogether different, lass.\u201d He shrugs at Noah. \u201cNo hard feelin\u2019s? Was just provin\u2019 my worth, ya ken?\u201d</p><p>Noah returns the nod in silence beside me. I cock my head, studying the guys. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t ken is what makes you think we aren\u2019t the bad guys.\u201d</p><p>Rhine smiles. It\u2019s a lazy, sexy expression that I\u2019m sure brings many a young girl to her knees. \u201cBecause you\u201d\u2014he casts a glance at Noah\u2014\u201cand he don\u2019t add up. No\u2019 tae mention what happened at the club. You both saved a score of humans, whilst those other two bloodsuckers escaped. And I can sense it.\u201d He inhales, exhales. \u201cSo do ya want our help? Or are we wastin\u2019 our time here?\u201d</p><p>I glance up at Noah, and he gives a slight nod. I move across the room and stand directly in front of Rhine. His eyes flash interest, and strangely enough, I detect no fear. Not one ounce. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good or bad. I\u2019ve got to know more. We can\u2019t have their young mortal lives balancing in our hands, especially when I don\u2019t know what the hell is going on with my own psyche. I\u2019m as unstable as Eli. With my gaze fastened on his, I grasp his hand and hold it between both of mine. His pupils dilate, just a fraction. Then I close my eyes.</p><p>I stand in a dank brick courtyard amid tall oaks and overgrown shrubs. A stone apartment complex rises before me. A window on the second floor is open, and a ripped curtain hangs in the gaping hole. No lights are on. I can\u2019t tell what time of day it is; no sun, no shadows. Just murky gray. A light rain falls. Shouting falls from the open window, and a thick, heavy accent trails out.</p><p>\u201cYa fookin\u2019 loser!\u201d The sound of fist connecting to bone rings out, and a slight whimpered growl follows it. \u201cI told ya tae give me all o\u2019 it! Dunnae ya hide the quid from me, boy!\u201d Another punch. Another growl. \u201cWhat do ya have tae say for your pathetic self? Pathetic, aye, just like your fookin\u2019 useless mother!\u201d A slap this time, and another. Another. A scream this time. A woman\u2019s scream. Laughter. \u201cOch, boy, you dinnae like your whore mum tae be slapped, aye? Too fookin\u2019 bad, then.\u201d Slap.</p><p>I can move, and I race toward the doorway leading into the apartment. Inside, the stairwell is cold and smelly, and I creep up the steps to the next floor. I open the door and move into a hallway lit by a single bare bulb at the end of a corridor. Beneath my feet, ratty red-and-blue-plaid carpeting. Three doors to my left, I stop and listen. The door is cracked, and I step inside.</p><p>The moment I\u2019m inside, I see Rhine. He\u2019s kneeling beside a woman, lying on the floor. Rhine looks a little younger than he is now. Maybe fifteen. His hair is longer, and it curls at his ears, the nape of his neck. He has a huge red welt across his porcelain cheek, and one eye is swollen and blackened, and his nose is bleeding. His lip is split and bleeding. He looks a goddamn mess.</p><p>All from the hands of his father. I know it\u2019s his father. Rhine looks exactly like him, only his father is older, bigger, meaner. And drunk as hell. Holy shit.</p><p>Rhine is comforting his mother, who\u2019s whimpering, sobbing. He\u2019s shielding her from the hands of his abusive dad. God, I hate abuse. In any form.</p><p>Rhine\u2019s father grabs him by the back of his hair and hauls him off his mother. I stare at Rhine\u2019s face, and it\u2019s awash with so many emotions; I feel each one. Fear. Hatred. Love. Loathing. Pain. His father yanks his head back and turns him, slamming the young Rhine against the wall. The older man holds him there by his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou dinna fook wi\u2019 me, lad,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you and that whore on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Rage illuminates Rhine\u2019s green eyes. Just as a burst of energy surges out of him, and he uses all of his young might to throw his father off him, a figure moving so fast I almost don\u2019t notice it hovers over the woman on the floor. He stands there, looking down, and I can only see the back of him. Tall. Broad shoulders. Dark blond hair, long, tied back.</p><p>And pulseless.</p><p>I blink. A vampire?</p><p>\u201cWhat the fook are ya doin\u2019 in my house?\u201d Rhine\u2019s dad yells. He shoves Rhine down and faces the newcomer. Rhine scrambles to his mom, grabs her by the shoulders, and helps her up. Rhine\u2019s father is a big guy\u2014easily six feet five\u2014and the vampire is eye to eye with him. Then the drunken man glances at Rhine and his mom, then back to the vampire. He throws back his head and laughs. \u201cOch, you fookin\u2019 that whore? You fancy that, aye?\u201d He laughs again, and the vampire remains silent. \u201cYou best check your cock, make sure it hasna rotted off\u2014\u201d</p><p>The drunk man\u2019s words die in his throat as the vampire lunges, morphs, and piranha-like fangs drop jagged from his gums. Without a single sound, he clamps down on the man\u2019s jugular, shakes his head a time or two, and Rhine\u2019s father\u2019s head comes clean off. The vampire spits it out and it rolls across the floor and stops an inch from my feet. Widened eyes filled with frozen disbelief stare up at me. Blood oozes from the torn ligaments and flesh. I fight the urge to throw up. The rest of the body on the floor begins to quake, convulse.</p><p>Rhine\u2019s mother screams; Rhine throws his arms around her and pulls her face to his chest, guarding and shielding her, and she sobs against her son. Those haunting green eyes of his stare at the vampire, who\u2019s now completely changed back. I can feel the pounding of Rhine\u2019s heart as he battles his fears, and as adrenaline charges through his veins, it also rushes through mine. The vampire crosses the room and stops a foot in front of Rhine. For the first time, he speaks. I can see his face now. Chiseled jaw. Straight nose. Long lashes. Gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I had to do that,\u201d the vampire says. \u201cI had no choice.\u201d</p><p>His accent is . . . not Scottish. It\u2019s something else. Not English. Not Irish. Something I can\u2019t place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLela, \u2019tis me.\u201d The vampire reaches a hand out to Rhine\u2019s mother. Rhine slaps his hand away, and the vampire smiles. But his mother turns her head, and she gasps.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she asks the vampire. She looks up at Rhine and caresses his cheek with her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, son. He willna hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Rhine\u2019s heart is beating hard; his breath is fast. He holds his mother tightly. He says nothing, but his eyes drift to the form of his headless father, lying crumpled and dead on the floor in a pool of blood.</p> <p>\u201cRhine, I\u2019ve loved your mum for as long as I can recall,\u201d the vampire says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pained me to see you both endure this hell. \u2019Tis over now. This . . . is no more.\u201d</p><p>Rhine slowly lifts his gaze to meet the vampire\u2019s.</p><p>The vampire reaches into the pocket of his long black trench and pulls from within a sheathed knife. Flipping the snap that keeps the blade secured, he takes it out. He shows it to Rhine. \u201c\u2019Tis pure silver, boy, and \u2019tis the only thing that will kill others like me. They\u2019re no\u2019 all good. Most are killers. Your father was one. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Rhine, wordlessly, nods.</p><p>I\u2019m slightly in shock. Rhine\u2019s father was a vampire? An abusive, drunken wife- and child-beating vampire? What the hell? How is that possible? Didn\u2019t see that one coming.</p> <p>The vampire turns the blade, hilt first, and offers it to Rhine. He takes it.</p><p>\u201cKeep it with you, boy,\u201d the vampire says. \u201cStraight into the heart is the fastest kill. Be sure before you use it. We\u2019re not all killers.\u201d The vampire casts a long, loving glance at Rhine\u2019s mother. \u201cYou\u2019re a fine son. Keep a watchful eye over your mum here. She loves you verra much.\u201d He again reaches into his trench; this time, he withdraws an envelope. He hands this to Rhine as well. \u201cTake this and go. Gather what little means something to you, and leave this hellhole. There\u2019s enough here to buy a house, new clothes, a car, and whatever else you might need. For years.\u201d He glances at Rhine\u2019s dead father\u2019s remains: a pile of ashes. \u201cJust leave that here.\u201d</p><p>Before Rhine can respond, the vampire moves. He\u2019s gone. Out of the apartment. I glance around. He\u2019s nowhere.</p><p>I blink, and I\u2019m back, standing in the guesthouse, directly in front of a grown-up Rhine. My hands still hold his, and his green eyes, aged beyond his years, stare down at me. He doesn\u2019t say anything; he\u2019s waiting on me.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what just happened?\u201d I ask.</p><p>A grin tips his mouth. \u201cAye. My theory\u2019s accurate. You\u2019re a bloody voyeur.\u201d</p> <p>His friends laugh.</p><p>I glower at him, and he gives me a nod. \u201cAye. You saw a rather nasty chunk o\u2019 my life.\u201d He sighs. \u201cAnd now ya know my horrors.\u201d</p><p>I drop his hands. \u201cBut you\u2019re human.\u201d</p><p>One side of his mouth lifts into a smirk. \u201cYou\u2019re no\u2019 the only one wi\u2019 a few tricks, girly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have traits, like me,\u201d I say. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Rhine shrugs. \u201cNo\u2019 much, mind ya. I canna run, or jump like you. I canna go at will into others\u2019 memories.\u201d He sighs. \u201cBut I can sniff out a bloodsucker. My hearing\u2019s pretty sick.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m fairly strong.\u201d</p><p>His band members chuckle. \u201cOch, that\u2019s the verra least, eh, Rhiney boy?\u201d Pete says.</p><p>Rhine shrugs again. \u201cI\u2019m no\u2019 much of a braggart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d Noah says from behind us. He walks up and stands next to me. He looks at Rhine. \u201cYou have tendencies? Care to clue me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father was a vampire,\u201d I offer, keeping my eyes on Rhine\u2019s. He stays silent and lets me do the talking. \u201cHe carries traits, like a human with tendencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather was?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>\u201cMy da had a unique disorder,\u201d Rhine says, and we\u2019re still watching each other. \u201cLiquor fooked him up.\u201d His eyes soften a little. Saddened, maybe. \u201cHe wasna always like that, though. I can remember him as a wee lad. He . . . treated me and my mum well.\u201d He sighs. \u201cBut once the liquor got in him, it dulled his vampirism. Eventually, it overcame him. He became a typical, fooked-up drunken vampire. Similar to drunk humans in that they eat very little whilst they drink ou\u2019 of their gourd. He still fed on human blood occasionally. But his body became absorbed with alcohol. It changed him. Still a vampire, aye, but only a shadow o\u2019 one. Sloppy. His brother came one day and, what would you call it?\u201d He smiles at me. \u201cIntervened?\u201d</p><p>The pain in Rhine\u2019s eyes makes me sad for him, and I know he can tell it. \u201cAnyway, my mum died no\u2019 too long after that. Cancer. My uncle came back after that, made sure I finished school and didna become a street punk.\u201d He grins at his friends. \u201cTaught me things. Valuable things.\u201d His green eyes turn stormy. \u201cThen a couple o\u2019 years ago we had a surge in rogue vampires here. My uncle was killed. And it\u2019s been me and my mates ever since.\u201d</p><p>Noah glances at me, then the rest of the band. \u201cAnd what sort of tricks can you little humans perform?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, they\u2019re just the fiercest fightin\u2019 fookers you\u2019ll ever meet, lad,\u201d Rhine tells him. \u201cThey\u2019ve helped me keep Inverness fairly cleaned up ever since. No one faster with a blade o\u2019 silver.\u201d He glances at me. \u201cExcept mayhap the dragon girl here.\u201d</p><p>Noah rubs his eyes, and sighs. A big, exaggerated, airless vampire\u2019s sigh.</p><p>\u201cWe need the help,\u201d I offer to Noah.</p><p>He glares at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d Then his silvery gaze turns to Rhine. \u201cWhat you saw in the club? Even we aren\u2019t certain what we\u2019re dealing with. The male?\u201d He inclines his head toward me. \u201cThat\u2019s her fianc\u00e9. He hasn\u2019t always been a prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d I say.</p><p>Noah goes on. No holds barred. Holding nothing at all back. \u201cHe\u2019s possessed or something. And you saw the female. She controls him and has a power even I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p><p>A smile lifts Rhine\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s a characteristic of his that\u2019s pretty damn appealing. Poor, poor young human girls.</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>Me and Noah both look at Rhine. The others chuckle.</p><p>Rhine rubs his jaw. \u201cAs I said before, you\u2019re in the Highlands, my friends. \u2019Tis a place unlike any other. Like a kaleidoscope, \u2019tis nothing ever the way you think it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop with the rhymes and tell us what you mean,\u201d Noah says. \u201cMy patience is growing thinner by the second.\u201d</p><p>Rhine laughs. \u201cAye, well, that female? She\u2019s old. An\u2019 before she was a vampire, she was a fookin\u2019 witch.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s almost . . . funny, the way the Scots swear. It\u2019s not as menacing, or as vulgar, as the American version. Like, it\u2019s okay to swear. It\u2019s almost distracting. Every time Rhine says fookin\u2019, I want to laugh. \u201cSo, how do you know all of this?\u201d</p><p>Rhine shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve seen one like her. When my uncle was killed. Fookin\u2019 witchpire cast a bloody spell that controlled his mind long enough for her tae take his bloody head. I\u2019ll ne\u2019er forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never seen Carrine before?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNever. That night at the club was the first time. She\u2019s a slippery one, though. We\u2019ve no\u2019 been able tae track her. Fookin\u2019 witchpire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, she\u2019s a witchpire. Great,\u201d Noah says. \u201cSo you boys are experts on all things paranormal, or just vampires?\u201d</p><p>Rhine shares a look with his bandmates, then turns to meet Noah\u2019s gaze. \u201cAye, we\u2019re pretty much experts on everythin\u2019. Ghosties, vampires, werewolves\u2014you name it. We keep Inverness safe. My uncle taught me everything he knew before he died.\u201d</p><p>Noah glances at me. \u201cHow ya holdin\u2019 up?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cOkay so far.\u201d I know he means my mind, and whether or not Carrine is prying into it again. I look at Rhine. \u201cHave you heard of St. Bueno\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Rhine gives a single nod. \u201cAye. O\u2019 course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fianc\u00e9 and another were cast into another realm. A Hell-like realm. I went after them. Got them both out. Only my fianc\u00e9 changed.\u201d I hold his gaze, filled with questions, curiosity. \u201cI think he\u2019s being commanded to kill me now. And he and the female may be behind the random killings here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s shit luck, lass,\u201d Pete says. \u201cDamn sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>With a slight nod, I acknowledge Pete\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of those realms,\u201d Rhine admits. \u201cNe\u2019er been in one myself, though.\u201d His eyes search mine. \u201cYou\u2019ll have tae tell me about it, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo just you five keep Inverness safe?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019re more of us,\u201d Rhine claims.</p><p>Noah and I share a quick glance. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cAfter my mum died, it left just me,\u201d Rhine begins. \u201cAnd my band here, o\u2019 course. We\u2019ve grown up together. But I knew it was up tae me, tae us, to keep this city right. There was nowhere else for us tae go, so we set out tae make sure the bloodsuckers stayed clear. We went tae the streets, gathered forces.\u201d He gives me a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Rhine shrugs. \u201cFifty or so.\u201d</p><p>Impressive. \u201cAll human?\u201d</p><p>Rhine nods. \u201cThere\u2019re a few English in the bunch. Do they count?\u201d</p><p>The other Ness boys chuckle.</p><p>Rhine holds my gaze. \u201cMany make the mistake you both did. Thinkin\u2019 we\u2019re street thugs. It keeps us covered well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know where to look?\u201d I ask.</p><p>There\u2019s a flash in Rhine\u2019s green eyes that makes me like him. \u201cWe just make ourselves seen,\u201d he admits. \u201cAnd we always run in packs.\u201d</p><p>I grin back. \u201cLike some vampire-hunting Lord of the Flies ring, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOch, girly,\u201d Tate says. \u201cWe hardly limit ourselves tae vampires only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that would be bloody boring,\u201d Gerry claims.</p><p>I turn, looking at Noah. We can use their help. We\u2019re running in circles right now, and Jake and the other WUP members are tied up in a wolfy war.</p> <p>They\u2019re humans, Riley. No offense, but any one of them could be killed, at any given time.</p><p>Noah. We\u2019re outnumbered and alone. Rhine and these guys? They run in packs. You take a lion. Fierce. Lethal. Deadly. But you surround it with a pack of angry men with spears and guns? Lion doesn\u2019t have a chance. We need them.</p><p>We stare at each other, me convincing, Noah deciding.</p><p>\u201cOch, you two are bloody talkin\u2019 tae each other, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d Tate asks.</p><p>I slide a look his way and lift an eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cMagic,\u201d he says in a low voice. I soon realize Tate is the Ness Boy with no filter.</p><p>All right, Riley. I guess we\u2019ve got no choice.</p><p>We don\u2019t. And I trust them. Whatever happens, I trust Rhine. He went through some major shit as a kid. It\u2019s made him stronger. Like me.</p><p>Noah gives me one last, long stare, then turns to Rhine. \u201cThere\u2019re a few things you need to know.\u201d He inclines his head to me. \u201cAbout her.\u201d</p><p>Rhine meets my gaze and nods. \u201cThen it\u2019s best if the whole lot o\u2019 us knows at once.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI dinnae know \u2019bout you, but I hate repeatin\u2019 myself. You can stay at our place.\u201d He looks at Pete and the others. \u201cMeet the boys o\u2019 the \u2019Ness.\u201d</p><p>Noah gives me a quick glance, and I nod. Pretty cute bunch of guys. Yeah, they look like punks, but if you look deep and hard enough, you\u2019d think you were staring at a hooded lot of Abercrombie models. Yet they fight vampires. Who would\u2019ve thought?</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s pack up,\u201d I say.</p><p>So we do. As Rhine and the others wait, Noah and I gather what little belongings we have, throw our weapons into our gear bags, and clean out the fridge. An unexpected turn of events, to be sure. I mean, who in the hell would ever have guessed a gang of human boys was running the show in Inverness? Rhine being the only one with a tinge of tendencies. It blows my mind. They all must be some tough little bastards.</p><p>Being good tenants, we place the trash in the can outside, and the key in the drop box. Rhine walks up to me at the curb. \u201cYour chariot awaits.\u201d</p><p>I glance over his shoulder at the two Rovers, parked with engines running.</p><p>\u201cNeed a hand wi\u2019 those?\u201d he says, inclining his head to my two duffels.</p><p>I shrug out of the one holding my clothes and hand it to him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Rhine takes it and walks to one of the Rovers. He opens the hatch and throws it in. Noah\u2019s at the other Rover, and he glances at me. \u201cSee ya there,\u201d he says, and climbs in.</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re ridin\u2019 wi\u2019 me then,\u201d Rhine says with a mischievous grin. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He quickly introduces me to the driver, Chess, and we head out.</p> <p>The Scots, I notice again, have a wicked accent. I never tire of hearing it. We climb into the backseat, and both Rovers pull out onto Montague Row.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re we headed?\u201d I ask Rhine.</p><p>\u201cMy da\u2019s brother left me a fair bank account when he died,\u201d he says. \u201cI used it wisely, as he had advised me. Invested some, saved some, and bought the Rovers, a motorbike, and an old hotel on the other side of the river.\u201d He stares at me. \u201cSo tell me about this fianc\u00e9 o\u2019 yours.\u201d He mock-frowns, his dark eyebrows stark against his alabaster skin. \u201cYou sure you want tae marry a bloodsucker? Or is there a chance you might fancy a younger human wi\u2019 no\u2019 so many tendencies?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cObviously excessive flirting is one of them.\u201d I glance out the window as we cross the river. \u201cI\u2019d die trying to save Eli from whatever fucked-up hell he\u2019s in,\u201d I say, then turn back to Rhine. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Rhine\u2019s eyes soften. \u201cI dinnae mean tae be disrespectful,\u201d he apologizes. \u201cAlthough I\u2019d be lying if I said I wouldna give it a go if he weren\u2019t a factor.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cI can read minds, junior. You could lie, but I\u2019d catch you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flash, then move to my inked wing at the corner of my eye. \u201cYou took a glance into my past,\u201d he says. \u201cTell me about yours.\u201d He nods to my ink. \u201cI see you fancy body art. I gotta admit, I fancy it on ya.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help laughing. Rhine is kinda like a junior version of Noah. \u201cBefore . . . all of this, I spent my days and a lot of nights at my ink shop. I\u2019m a tattoo artist by trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. And that dragon\u2019s tail winding round your arm there,\u201d he says, inclining his head. \u201cWhere does that lead?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cMy back. I\u2019m slightly famous for my work in the States.\u201d</p><p>Rhine nods appreciatively. \u201cWell, then, we\u2019ll just have tae exchange ink shows once we\u2019re settled.\u201d</p><p>Pete turns around from the front passenger seat and looks at me. \u201cMaster ink artist, aye? Have you more than just your dragon and wings, then?\u201d</p><p>I grin. Pete\u2019s cute, with expressive blue eyes, wiry, and a scar on his chin in the place so many kids get them after slipping off the monkey bars on the playground. \u201cA few more.\u201d</p><p>Pete returns the smile. \u201cThen a fine exchange we shall have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete here\u2019s chicken tae get inked,\u201d Rhine says. \u201cScared o\u2019 needles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fook up,\u201d Pete argues.</p><p>\u201cScared o\u2019 needles but doesna mind pokin\u2019 a bloodsucker in the heart with a blade,\u201d Chess adds. A little older, maybe twenty-one, Chess has a matter-of-fact mannerism that belies the mischievous glint in his hazel eyes. He grins at me through the mirror, and I grin back.</p><p>I stare at the three Ness boys with interest. They\u2019ve all taken me by surprise.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take us long to reach Rhine\u2019s hotel-turned-slayer\u2019s shack\u2014and it\u2019s far, far from a shack at all. After we cross the river, the Rover turns down several streets until we\u2019ve just reached the edge of the city limits. Chess turns down a long tree-lined drive that leads to an ivy-covered stone building, four stories high. It\u2019s flanked by enormous trees with wide spread branches.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the Crachan,\u201d Rhine announces, and he puts on a proper British accent, so different from his sharp guttural Scot\u2019s brogue. \u201cI do hope you enjoy your stay immensely.\u201d</p><p>Laughter erupts from Chess and Pete. We pull in, winding around a large half-circle drive. It sort of reminds me of Gabriel\u2019s Crescent . . . just not as creepy. There are a few vehicles parked along the front, and several motorcycles. The Rover stops, and we get out. The other one arrives, and Noah joins me. We stare up at the Crachan, pronounced Cracken. It\u2019s a pretty big place.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the Hotel California?\u201d I sing to Noah.</p><p>Noah eyes me. \u201cShould I worry about the kid?\u201d</p><p>I move my gaze to Rhine, who\u2019s now on his cell phone a few feet away. His back is to us, but I hear the muffled snort. \u201cHe heard you,\u201d I say, and smile. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot like you, Miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I asked if I should worry.\u201d</p><p>I shift my duffel on my shoulder, the weight of the blades and scatha almost a comfort. Rhine stuffs his cell in his back pocket, shoulders my other duffel, and joins us. He nods at Noah. \u201cThis way.\u201d He turns and we follow, making our way up the graveled walkway. I notice it\u2019s not too shabbily kept for a bunch of guys. Impressed again.</p><p>We walk through a pair of tall, intricately carved and thick wooden doors and into a cavernous open hall. Like many old manors, I notice, it has a massive fireplace occupying one wall. A huge flat-screen takes up another wall, and a few sofas, several chairs, and a long wooden coffee table sit before it. A few guys occupy the chairs and sofa. They glance our way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show ya tae your rooms,\u201d Rhine says. \u201cMost of the others aren\u2019t home yet.\u201d He leads us to a sweeping staircase at the end of the foyer. \u201cOne of the top requirements to reside here.\u201d He glances at me as we start up the steps. \u201cGotta be employed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Noah says. \u201cWhat\u2019s another requirement?\u201d</p><p>Rhine stops at the second floor and steps onto the landing. He grins. \u201cCan\u2019t be a fookin\u2019 scaredy-cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood requirement,\u201d I say. Rhine inclines his head, and we follow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put you two across the hall from each other,\u201d Rhine says, and looks at me as he stops. The room number is 208. The door is wide open. \u201cI\u2019ll get your keys whilst you both settle in,\u201d he says, and walks into the room, sets my duffel on the floor in front of the bed, and comes back out. When he passes Noah, he grins. \u201cAye. You\u2019ve plenty tae worry about.\u201d Then he hurries up the hallway at a jog and disappears down the steps.</p><p>Noah looks at me from the hallway. \u201cHe\u2019s a little more intense than I first thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you he heard you. Besides, he\u2019s got a lot on his young shoulders,\u201d I return. \u201cHe\u2019s all right in my book.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiles. \u201cI know that.\u201d He shrugs on his bag. \u201cI\u2019m going to call Andorra and give him an update. And check back with Gabriel about Carrine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be over here,\u201d I say, and turn and walk into my room. The hotel itself is old, as in a hundred years maybe, and although large, it\u2019s modest with a blue-and-black-plaid theme, sparsely furnished, but clean. A double bed stands against one wall, a tall chest of drawers, a straight-back wooden chair and desk. Walking to the bed, I drop my weapons duffel on top of it. I unzip the bag and pull out my scatha.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a wicked piece of armor,\u201d Rhine says at my side. I\u2019d heard his footfalls as he climbed the steps, so it didn\u2019t surprise me for him to be speaking in my ear. \u201cWhat is it? A crossbow?\u201d</p><p>I like the way his r\u2019s roll and his o\u2019s sound like ooh. \u201cIt\u2019s an ancient device, newly built.\u201d I hand it to him, and he palms it gently. \u201cIt\u2019s a scatha. Medieval design.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turns it over, inspecting it thoroughly. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d</p><p>Digging into a side pouch of the duffel, I retrieve one of the empty cartridges Gawan Conwyk had left me. \u201cYou take a prefilled cartridge of mystic St. Bueno\u2019s Well holy water.\u201d I reach over and drop the loading lever. \u201cLoad, lock, and pull back the release.\u201d I look at him, and his eyes glint with interest. \u201cThen you blast to hell all sorts of demons and whatever else is lurking in the shadows of the underworld.\u201d</p><p>Rhine\u2019s large hands move deftly over the scatha, and as if he\u2019d been doing it all his life, he quickly unloads the cartridge and hands it back to me. \u201cAnd you plan on going back into this demon-filled underworld, aye?\u201d</p> <p>I shrug, and he hands me the scatha. I run my fingers over the cool metal, then look at him. \u201cI will if I have to.\u201d</p><p>Understanding gleams in his eyes, and he gives a slight nod. \u201cI hope one day your fianc\u00e9 knows what he\u2019s got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always said he was a lucky fuck,\u201d Noah says, striding into the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to agree wi\u2019 ya there,\u201d Rhine adds. \u201cReady tae meet the Crachan boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one thing, Rhine,\u201d Noah says. \u201cSomething you need to know about Riley here.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cBesides having the DNA of four vampires, along with newly acquired traits of a fallen angel, she can move faster than any vampire I\u2019ve encountered\u2014myself included. She can scale a three-story building in under ten seconds. Her fighting skills are unmatched. Lethal. And she can read minds at will.\u201d He glances at me. \u201cHer fianc\u00e9 is being controlled by the witchpire, Carrine, who has decided to crawl into her brain and try and drive her crazier than what she already is. She\u2019s up to her eyeballs in deep, emotional shit. Just so you know.\u201d</p> <p>Rhine nods. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d He inclines his head. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We follow Rhine down the corridor, and I take notice of his demeanor, his movements, and I realize that we\u2019ve really never been completely introduced.</p><p>\u201cYou got a last name, Rhine?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks down at me as we walk, and smiles. \u201cMacLeod.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cPoe.\u201d I incline my head to Noah. \u201cMiles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re all like bloody family,\u201d Rhine says. We hit the landing and I\u2019m slightly overwhelmed by the small crowd that\u2019s gathered in the great hall. My eyes scan the group, and including the other three I already know, plus Chess, there\u2019s at least, I don\u2019t know, thirty guys from what appear to be between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five. They\u2019re parked in sofas, on chairs, and on the floor. No lie, it\u2019s a gruff-looking bunch, and if I ran into any of them on the street, I\u2019d almost bet my life they were thugs.</p> <p>I have a feeling I\u2019m about to get schooled. Again.</p><p>Rhine jogs ahead of us and moves over to the hearth. He beckons to us, and we stand next to him and face the crowd.</p><p>\u201cRight, then, I know some o\u2019 you\u2019ve already heard about these two,\u201d Rhine says. His voice carries over the hall, a raspy sound that belies the crooning tone he creates when he sings. \u201cNoah Miles, Riley Poe. Both from America. They\u2019ll be stayin\u2019 for a bit, and they need our help.\u201d</p><p>Total silence. Not a single solitary word comes from the guys. Their eyeballs are all focused on us, interested and curious, but no one speaks. So I decide to break the silence. I glance at Rhine, just to make sure he\u2019s cool with it, and as if he knows what I\u2019m up to, he nods once. I face the crowd of slayers.</p><p>\u201cYou know there\u2019re vampires in Inverness,\u201d I begin. \u201cMiles and I belong to an organization\u2014Worldwide Unexplained Phenomena\u2014and we\u2019re assigned to take care of it.\u201d I meet the questioning eyes of the guys. \u201cUnfortunately, one of the vampires is my fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>A few jaws drop. A few brows furrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a human with tendencies. Venom from four vampires, plus a little something from a fallen angel that I haven\u2019t quite nailed yet\u2014no pun intended\u2014clinging to my DNA.\u201d I nod at Noah. \u201cHe\u2019s been a vampire since the American Revolution.\u201d I smile at the wide-eyed crowd. \u201cWe won that, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFookin\u2019 English,\u201d one guy says. They all chuckle.</p> <p>Scotland, I\u2019ve noticed, is still fiercely proud and fiercely independent from Mother England.</p><p>I also notice a few of the guys getting restless, glaring at Noah. I focus, scan a few brains, search through a couple of thoughts. I point at a guy now sitting on the edge of the sofa, scowling. Young, twenty maybe, edgy. Solid as a pile of bricks. \u201cYou throw the blade you\u2019ve got jammed into your boot there and I\u2019ll be on you in a bad way, before you draw your next breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFookin\u2019 whatever\u2014\u201d</p><p>I fly, straddle him, and yank the blade from his boot. I hold it to his jugular. Icy blue eyes widen as they stare at me.</p><p>\u201cFookin\u2019 sick,\u201d one says beside me.</p><p>I glance at him, the blade still pressed to the throat of the one I\u2019m straddling. \u201cYou ever hear of a Strigoi?\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes fix on mine. \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have three gens in me,\u201d I add. \u201cDon\u2019t fook with me.\u201d</p><p>The guy swallows hard enough it almost echoes.</p><p>Just that fast, I\u2019m off the lap and handing the guy his blade, hilt first. He takes it and nods. \u201cSorry, then,\u201d he says.</p><p>I look out at every single face there. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, and I don\u2019t know any of you,\u201d I say. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to stop the killing of innocents, just like you are.\u201d</p><p>Several nods make it clear to me that I have their attention now, and I return to stand between Noah and Rhine. Next, I give in detail Noah\u2019s and my history regarding the Gullah, Savannah, and Charleston, and how Noah isn\u2019t salivating by all the strong young pulses gathered in the room. More than a few look at poor Noah with notable discomfort, but I put them all at ease by letting them know his eating habits. His role in Charleston as Guardian finally puts them at ease.</p><p>Then Noah steps up and clears his throat. \u201cOne thing more you need to know about Riley,\u201d he says, his Southern drawl commanding, raspy. \u201cBecause she has the most fucked-up DNA in existence, she doesn\u2019t typically sleep every day, like you. She unexpectedly falls into a narcoleptic coma every few days or so.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cAnd she\u2019s due one at any time.\u201d He looks back at the guys. \u201cShe does exhibit a few signs you might want to look out for. Disoriented. Stumbles. Weakness. Difficulty expressing words. Eyes start rolling in her head. If you notice, she has no trouble at all with any of these. And when her body has had enough, she\u2019ll start to slow down. Then fall out, sometimes for two days. So if you notice her acting bizarre, catch her before she hits the ground.\u201d</p><p>I pass an uninterested glance at the TV, but something catches my eye. It\u2019s the local news. \u201cCan you turn that up?\u201d I ask the one who is closest to the remote. He nods, and ups the volume. A young woman is broadcasting. Her smooth skin belies the fear I can see in her eyes as she reports.</p><p>\u201cTwo more bodies were discovered this morning, both in close proximity to the Eastgate Shopping Centre,\u201d she says. Behind her is the entrance to the center, the large Eastgate letters standing out from the Celtic design behind it.</p><p>\u201cShoppers are encouraged not to linger after dark,\u201d the reporter says. \u201cThis may be the handiwork of a serial killer. Take full precaution as the victims are neither all men nor all women. So, everyone, be careful. Rachel Canns, Inverness Live.\u201d</p><p>I look at Noah. I don\u2019t say anything. I can\u2019t. Two more victims, right out from under our noses. Was it Eli? Has he become nothing more than a blood-seeking monster? Carrine is controlling him. She can make him do whatever she desires. Maybe she\u2019s making him do the killing now? The thought totally sickens me.</p><p>Noah barely shakes his head, reading my thoughts. He turns to Rhine. \u201cWe need to hit the streets. What\u2019s your method?\u201d</p><p>All humor has disappeared from Rhine\u2019s face. His mouth is pulled tight, eyebrows drawn. \u201cWe break into lots o\u2019 no less than six. Scour the city. Run the streets.\u201d He glances to the guys and inclines his head. \u201cJep there, we\u2019ve known each other since we were wee lads. He knows every nook an\u2019 cranny in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Jep answers. He\u2019s tall, lanky, maybe twenty. His hair is longer, pulled into a ponytail. A scar slashes across his forehead, through one eyebrow, and disappears. He looks like he can kick some serious ass. \u201cWe got six groups now. More will join as they get off o\u2019 work and such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019re a few still in school,\u201d Rhine says. \u201cThey never miss a day.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cPretty little organized freaky society you got here,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do all right, yeah,\u201d Rhine agrees. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I nod. Several others voice their ayes and yeahs. Most stand up, shuffle their feet, and glance around, waiting on instruction, I suspect.</p><p>\u201cI guess we should split up,\u201d Noah says to me. In his eyes I can see doubt; he so doesn\u2019t want to split up. We have no choice, though. To have me and Noah together wouldn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, we should. Spread the powers around a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, you can run wi\u2019 Jep and his crew,\u201d Rhine says. He grins at me. \u201cO\u2019 course, it\u2019s only right if you run wi\u2019 me, lass. In case you drop into one o\u2019 your comas.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my gaze. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>We break up into six groups. The adrenaline gaining speed and rushing through the Ness boys is palpable. I can almost see it floating in the room. It all but quakes with their readiness, their hunger. Like a live thing. It\u2019s absolutely incredible.</p><p>My group forms, and besides me and Rhine, there\u2019s four others I\u2019m introduced to. I\u2019m terrible with groups of names at once, so I push that worry to the recesses of my brain; the last thing I need to concentrate on is trying to keep straight thirty names. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>From now on, they\u2019re the Ness boys to me. All of them, except Rhine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take city center,\u201d Rhine announces to the others. \u201cEveryone else spread out and take our regular routes. After hours, we\u2019ll slip into Eastgate, see what\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>Many voices agree with varying degrees of accent, and the groups disperse. Outside, the sky has fallen in dark shades of gray and purple. Duel lampposts at the end of the Crachan\u2019s drive are lit, illuminating the street beyond. I inhale, and a sensation of pure evil washes over me. Different from Edinburgh, but still evil. It\u2019s met with a sense of urgency, too. Something else that I can\u2019t put my finger on. I\u2019m sure it has to do with the fact that it all revolves around Carrine and Eli being the cause of it.</p> <p>And that straight up makes me ill.</p><p>I close my eyes, inhale again, and let it out slowly. I gotta do this. I have to make things right. Whoever is calling the shots for the killings, they have to be stopped. If Eli\u2019s involved, and can\u2019t be saved . . .</p><p>My body shivers at the thought. Panic wells up inside me for a moment. Eli\u2019s face flashes behind my closed eyelids, and he\u2019s the old Eligius. My Eli. Sexy. Loving. Noble.</p><p>Then, in a blur, that face of his changes and he\u2019s the Eli in Hush 51, the same one with the hateful glint to those cerulean eyes I love so much.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Rhine says. He\u2019s standing by my side, a good six inches taller, and seeming far older than his nineteen or twenty years. Those knowing green eyes study me for a second. Study me like he\u2019s known me longer than a few days. \u201cYou gonna be okay?\u201d</p> <p>I glance around me, up toward the darkening skies, and watch as the Ness boys separate and start their routes. If a pack of humans are hell-bent on keeping their streets and innocents safe, then I can do no less than every single thing I\u2019m capable of.</p><p>I decide to put my own desires aside.</p><p>The old Eli wouldn\u2019t expect anything less.</p><p>My gaze returns to Rhine\u2019s, and I give him an assuring nod. \u201cI will be. When all this is over, and the killings are stopped, and this city is safe again, then yeah, I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>His mouth lifts at one corner and the smile lingers in his eyes. \u201cMagic. Let\u2019s get goin\u2019, then, aye?\u201d He inclines his head toward the street.</p><p>I push my heavy heart aside and fill the void with sheer determination. We start off down the drive, four other Ness boys behind us.</p> <p>We\u2019re on a vampire hunt.</p><p>I have a feeling there\u2019ll be bloodshed from both sides.</p><p>Part Six</p><p> SEDUCTIVE FOE</p><p>If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour . . . you\u2019re going to see some serious shit.</p><p>\u2014Dr. Emmett Brown, Back to the Future, 1985</p><p>Yeah, Riley. I don\u2019t know her all that well, but what I do know, she doesna take much shite off no one. That includes me, Miles, and more than likely, her bloodsucker boyfriend. As a human wi\u2019 tendencies myself, I can sense a power wi\u2019in her that is unlike anything I\u2019ve yet seen before. Miles said she had fooked-up DNA. I can goddamn well believe it. Yeah, what I wouldna give to keep her.</p><p>\u2014Rhine MacLeod</p> <p>We walk up and down the streets of Inverness until well after ten p.m. Rhine has gotten a few calls on his cell, but nothing panned out. We\u2019re making our way up High Street for the umpteenth time, and I glance at the city center. Newer buildings mixed in and side by side with the older ones; some with coned turrets, others with tall spires. All flat fronts with colorful store signs above the doors. And the ever-present double arches of McDonald\u2019s gleaming golden yellow in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cThis time o\u2019 year we mostly have just the locals runnin\u2019 the streets,\u201d Rhine says beside me as we walk. There\u2019re three of us on one side of the street, three on the other. I nod and glance at the patrons. Foot traffic has definitely slowed down for the night, and most of the businesses are closed. \u201cMostly university students,\u201d Rhine says, and shoves his hands into the pockets of his brown leather jacket. He\u2019s wearing a dark blue skully, and it stands stark against his pale skin. \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>I tune my hearing, keying it to a lower frequency, and I pick up only small bits of animal pulses, baby hiccups, and so many heartbeats it creates a low hum in my ears. I shake my head and look at him. \u201cNothing out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re on the streets for another two hours before I see him.</p><p>At the far end of the sidewalk, standing against the building. The shadows swallow him, but I can see. I can smell.</p><p>It\u2019s Eli.</p><p>Beside him, Carrine.</p><p>The moment she sees me, she smiles. My eyes drift to Eli, and his gaze collides with mine. He stares at me, and that expression of recognition flashes in his eyes. Carrine moves in front of Eli, presses her body seductively against him, and I notice the muscles flexing at his jaw, and his brow furrowing. He looks angry. Then all expression fades, his gaze clouds, and he widens his stance to accommodate her. His arms go around her waist as they start making out, and his hands grope her buttocks and pull her hard against his crotch. His soft moan rides the breeze and hits me in the gut. We\u2019re walking toward them, and my pace quickens. Rhine\u2019s hand closes over mine, holding me back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he warns. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>No sooner does he say it than Eli lifts his head and looks directly at me. We\u2019re about fifteen yards away when a young woman rounds the corner close to them. So fast I\u2019m unsure it happens, Carrine grabs the girl by the arm, pressing her between her own body and Eli\u2019s, and when I blink, they\u2019re gone.</p><p>The young woman\u2019s heartbeat is racing. That much I can hear.</p><p>\u201cFookin\u2019 A,\u201d Rhine says under his breath, and starts to jog. I fight not to pass him. \u201cSo that\u2019s your bloody boyfriend?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer. \u201cAnd the female. Carrine.\u201d</p><p>As we run, and round the corner, we find it empty except the long shadows stretching across from the buildings. Rhine grabs his cell and makes a call. \u201cAt the Eastgate shopping mall. Round the back entrance.\u201d He ends the call and stuffs his cell into his pocket. At the same time, he withdraws a silver blade. The other Ness boys from across the street have joined us.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asks me, and I nod. \u201cGood. We\u2019ll take the male alive if possible, aye?\u201d he clarifies to the others. \u201cBut dinnae endanger yourselves, lads. Us first. Then him.\u201d</p><p>Rhine grabs my hand and tugs me toward the alley. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Squeezing between two buildings through a narrow cobbled close, we slip through the back of Eastgate and Rhine climbs the first-story fire escape. He glances back at me, still on the ground. I leap up to him. Admiration glints off the streetlight shining in his eyes. \u201cNow?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I listen closely; the human\u2019s racing heart is coming from within the mall. \u201cStill alive. In there.\u201d</p><p>Rhine leads me up to the roof. I could have climbed and leaped a lot faster, but I would\u2019ve had to just pace waiting on him. We breach the top and he leads us to a single door. It opens under his hand, and we hit the stairwell leading back down and into the mall. I don\u2019t even ask questions as to how he just opened a rooftop door to a public shopping center. I figure he\u2019s got connections.</p><p>Inside the building, the human\u2019s heart races wildly. We exit onto the ground floor, and we\u2019re in some old-fashioned-looking market section. High wooden-arched beams peak like a cathedral above our heads. Several shops, their doors closed and locked down, line the walk.</p><p>\u201cThe Victorian Market,\u201d Rhine offers. \u201cDepartment stores and food court that way.\u201d He points. \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>I listen. Footfalls. Faster. Louder.</p><p>Just then the young woman comes running from around the corner up ahead. Her heart is floored, and the fright on her face, the sheer terror, drops my own heart to my stomach.</p><p>Out of nowhere, a figure flies down and tackles her.</p><p>I leap. No thought. No process. Only action.</p><p>Vaguely, I notice Rhine and the others hauling ass behind me. And others, around, swarming in. I focus on the woman and just as the male\u2014not Eli, just a rogue\u2014drops his teeth, I lunge and knock him on his back. With my hands around his throat, I spare a quick glare at the woman. \u201cRun. Toward those boys. They\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>She simply stares at me, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d I yell.</p><p>Something flashes in her eyes, and she scrambles up, whimpering, and the last thing I hear are the rubber soles from her hikers squeaking on the tile.</p><p>Hoping Rhine and the others deal with her, I turn my attention to the rogue. He\u2019s strong as shit, young. Newblood. His eyes are red, flecked with yellow. His face is fully morphed, and as I hold his mouth away from me, his jaws are snapping like a goddamn rabid dog\u2019s. We struggle, fall backward, and he throws me against the wall. The moment my back hits I lunge back at him as he\u2019s darting away, heading for the running woman. I grab his ankle, yank him down. He\u2019s on top of me again, holding my hands pinned above my head. Drool falls from his jagged teeth and onto my chest.</p><p>I focus, stare at his face until it becomes a pinpoint; then I suck in a long breath, and just as his head hurls toward my chest, I explode power. He flies off me and lands against the far wall. He\u2019s up and lunging at me, but now I\u2019ve yanked my silver from my waistband. I thrust it into his heart as he falls against me.</p><p>The rogue drops to the floor, quivering.</p><p>Done.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d Rhine\u2019s voice yells from above me. I glance up. There are Ness boys everywhere. As there are vampires everywhere.</p><p>It\u2019s hard at first glance to tell them apart.</p><p>At first.</p><p>Then they\u2019re all perfectly crystal-clear.</p><p>Males. Females. I spot them now, scattered over the mall, hanging from the upper floor, pacing the food court. All young. Void of heartbeats. Void of emotion or compassion. Vampires.</p><p>Just like Savannah, when my little brother, Seth, was bitten by Strigoi Valerian Arcos.</p><p>Goddamn, I hate that they\u2019re so young. My eyes scan the upper floor of the mall. No sign of Eli or Carrine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One vampire, a female, lunges directly at me.</p><p>Everything happens in slow mo after that.</p><p>Somewhere, from a music store, I suspect, Kansas cranks out \u201cDust in the Wind\u201d over the mall intercom as I take down the female. She\u2019s out of her mind crazy with bloodlust, and I waste no time in ending her swiftly. She falls into a quaking heap at my feet, and I withdraw my blade and wipe it on her coat. Her teeth are still snapping as she begins to disintegrate.</p> <p>My eyes are everywhere now, and for a brief second or two, I catch Rhine and some of the other Ness boys in action. Rhine fights up close, and he sincerely reminds me of a younger version of Noah. Fights like a mad dog.</p><p>The other Ness boys throw, and within ten seconds I notice three vamps are taken out on an air-lifted silver blade. The moment it does the job, the Ness boys retrieve their blades. I catch sight of Pete, who\u2019s joined us. He\u2019s fast.</p><p>Just then I see Eli. He catches my eye and disappears around an upstairs turn. I free-run up to the food court, determined to confront him. Or kill Carrine. Preferably that.</p><p>My heart, although megaslow from all the vampire venom coursing within me, still feels like it\u2019s slamming against my ribs as I see Eli disappear. Thoughts race through my head as I spare a glance down at Rhine and the others. There are still a few rogues left. After watching what I\u2019d just seen, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll question Rhine and the Ness boys. Ever. Badasses, every one of them.</p><p>Not bad for humans.</p> <p>The moment I round the corner, I draw up short. So fast I almost lose my breath. Eli\u2019s standing directly in front of me. It\u2019s like swallowing a sword, standing there looking at him, looking at me, with bloodred eyes laced with hatred. Then they focus, lock on to mine, and lighten. Recognition passes over his face. I can see it, plain as day, even through the shadowy closed mall. He stares hard at me, cocks his head to one side, studying me. For a moment, those blood-lusted red eyes return to cerulean blue.</p><p>I push aside my aching heart and concentrate. I focus on his face, then beyond, deeper, to his memory. Eligius. It\u2019s me. Riley. Please, can\u2019t you see me?</p><p>Again, Eli cocks his head to the side, his eyes focusing on me.</p><p>Eli? Please . . .</p><p>Kill him, Riley. He\u2019s no longer your love. You must do it.</p><p>The voice startles me. It\u2019s not Eli\u2019s. I\u2019m . . . not sure who it is. Can\u2019t worry about it now. Focusing again on Eli, I take a step back as he advances slowly. His eyes are unchanged. He is focused solely on me.</p> <p>\u201cEli,\u201d I say out loud. If I had something to hit him with, I would. Right in the head. Maybe that would knock him out of his bloodsucking trance.</p><p>Then Eli stops. He\u2019s still staring directly at me, but in silence. I can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s doing. I focus on him once more, hard. Trying to worm into his thoughts. There\u2019s something there\u2014I can\u2019t see. Can\u2019t get through.</p><p>It\u2019s no use, Riley. He\u2019s no longer the same as before. There is no conscious thought left in his memory. Not of you. Not of his family. Only bloodlust. You know this. Don\u2019t you?</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d I yell at the voice. My eyes, though, remain locked on Eli\u2019s. I can sense a buildup of power, of strength. Like a lion stalking its prey, like a cat in the yard with its ass in the air, stalking a butterfly. The buildup is so intense it sends waves of electricity toward me. Eli\u2019s eyes fade, then turn red. Any second. He\u2019s going to lunge, rip my throat out . . .</p><p>My hand slides to the back of my waistband, grips the silver blade there, lowers. My fingers tighten around it. I\u2019m ready. I don\u2019t want to be, but I am.</p><p>Kansas is still playing over the intercom. \u201cCarry On Wayward Son.\u201d</p><p>How freaking ironic.</p><p>Do it. Go on.</p> <p>I hear it before I see it. I react.</p><p>And it all happens at once.</p><p>Behind me, a whirring noise. I know it\u2019s a blade. I leap. Grasp it. Catch it by the blade. It tears through my skin, and it\u2019s sharp as hell. Warm blood trickles down my outreached hand, down my arm, beneath my leather jacket.</p><p>Eli leaps toward me.</p><p>We clash in midair.</p><p>The weight of his body takes us both down to the tiled floor, and he lands on me. With one powerful swipe, he\u2019s knocked the blade from my hand. His gaze slides over to the blood oozing from my palm. His head shakes, so fast it blurs, and jerks to a sudden stop. No longer Eli now. Our eyes meet, just for a split second.</p><p>\u201cEli, please,\u201d I whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Before I can gauge his reaction, a body flies out of nowhere and slams into Eli. He\u2019s knocked to the floor.</p><p>Noah.</p><p>And he\u2019s fully morphed, too.</p><p>\u201cNoah, don\u2019t!\u201d I yell.</p><p>Then everyone freezes. No one moves. No one even slides a glance. But I can see her. Hear her.</p><p>Carrine moves from the shadows of a storefront, and into my view. She\u2019s wearing tight leather pants, black heeled boots, and a black leather vest over a billowy white shirt. Her hair hangs long. Her face, flawless, white as snow. Lips red. Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as powerful as you think, Ms. Poe,\u201d she says. She steps over Eli and Noah, frozen in a locked position on the floor. I can do nothing more than stare at her. A lazy smile stretches plump red lips over her teeth. She walks toward me and stops a foot away. Her eyes travel over me, down to my boots, then back up. \u201cDo you know what I was before all this? Before sucking the blood from human vessels became my only means of survival? No? Well,\u201d she says, moving in a circle around me. \u201cI was a master of the dark arts, from a long family of proud Highland witches. You see, I have Pict blood running through me, Ms. Poe.\u201d She laughs. \u201cWell, I used to. And \u2019twas verra old blood. Filled with magic and spells and potion recipes that I\u2019d honed over the years.\u201d She stops again and faces me. With a long, elegant finger, she pushes a hank of my hair from my eyes. \u201cThen I was changed. My life, stolen. But,\u201d she says, moving again. \u201cI . . . adapted. Yes, that\u2019s the perfect word for it. Adapted.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m frozen to the floor. My joints and limbs paralyzed. What the hell! I stare into her insane blue depths. She is not going to kill me. I\u2019m not going to die. Not like this.</p><p>Leaning forward, she presses her lips to mine, lingers, and pulls back. \u201cYou will,\u201d she says.</p><p>In that brief moment, I think she\u2019s right.</p><p>Then she grins. \u201cBut not now. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not time. You see, I am under intense orders myself. My savior freed me from my prison. \u2019Tis the verra reason I\u2019m even walking the Earth again. I have no choice but to wait.\u201d She smiles at me. \u201cBut when it\u2019s time, you\u2019ll know it.\u201d She turns, walks back toward Eli and Noah, clutched in a frozen frantic fighting stance on the floor. Carrine stares down at them. \u201cOch, damn,\u201d she breathes. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine one, too.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cI can smell his erotica.\u201d She looks at me. \u201cHowever do you stand it? I want to fuck him right now, just standing here.\u201d</p><p>I can do nothing more than stare hatred at her.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cSuch a pity.\u201d</p><p>Fear, fury, and the need to make sure nothing else happens to someone I love gathers in one place, deep inside me. Everything else around me blurs but Carrine. She is up and at the forefront. Although slowly at first, I draw in a long, deep breath.</p><p>When I exhale, it\u2019s a maelstrom of fury.</p><p>The sonic boom that comes forth from me isn\u2019t as colossal as the one Carrine had delivered back at Hush 51. But it\u2019s big enough. Forceful enough.</p><p>It blows Carrine off her heeled and booted feet.</p><p>Then my joints release; I can move. It hurts at first, but I break free.</p><p>At the same time, Carrine, who\u2019s landed several feet away, leaps to her feet. She yells in an unfamiliar language to Eli. Beckons him. He shakes free of Noah and, without sparing me a glance, runs to her. They disappear into the shadowed recesses of the storefronts. Just as I leap to take off after them, my ankle is grabbed and I hit the floor.</p><p>Noah has a grip and he isn\u2019t letting go.</p><p>On my stomach, I turn and look at Noah Miles. He\u2019s on his stomach, his arm outstretched, his strong fingers gripping my ankle. We stare like that for a moment. I know now I can\u2019t go after Eli and Carrine. Another time, maybe. Not now.</p><p>Only when I notice Rhine moving toward us do I try again to get up. This time, Noah lets me go. We both stand, and in seconds we\u2019re surrounded by Rhine and no fewer than fifteen Ness boys.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Rhine says, and he yanks off his skully and rubs his hand over his short-clipped hair. \u201cThat was . . . interesting.\u201d</p><p>The low drone of the others talking in hushed voices buzzes in my ear. I look at him. \u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly. She could have walked up and killed every single one of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitchpire,\u201d Rhine says. \u201cLooks like I may have underestimated her a wee bit.\u201d</p><p>I stare. \u201cA wee? That\u2019s more than a fucking wee, Rhine.\u201d</p><p>Several of the others chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOy, lass,\u201d he says, and chucks me under the chin. \u201cNo need tae worry about us Ness boys.\u201d He glances out across his brethren. \u201cWe just have a bit more studyin\u2019 tae do. That bloodsuckin\u2019 bitch willna get the better o\u2019 us again.\u201d</p><p>Several ayes from the Ness boys affirm his words.</p><p>\u201cIt coulda been the end o\u2019 you, fool,\u201d I return in my best Scottish accent.</p><p>That brings out a deep laugh from Rhine.</p><p>Even Noah chuckles.</p><p>\u201cRight, then,\u201d Pete says from the crowd. \u201cAt least we killed us quite a lot o\u2019 bloodsuckers this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and saved that wee girl, too,\u201d another said. \u201cThat\u2019s, eh . . .\u201d He starts counting on his fingers. \u201cEight bloodsuckers down, one fine lassie saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fookin\u2019 heroes!\u201d</p><p>I glance at the watch on Rhine\u2019s wrist, and I pull it closer. It\u2019s almost five in the morning.</p><p>Where did all the time go?</p><p>Everythong\u2019s looking hazy. Did I just say everythong? I mean everything.</p><p>I\u2019m staring at Rhine, and his face is blurring, too. I squint, stare harder, trying to focus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think we should go,\u201d I say, and start to move. \u201cI\u2019m hungry as holy fucking hell on goddamn wheels.\u201d</p><p>I take one step, swagger, then two more steps, and I\u2019m walking straight toward Rhine. A large, cocky grin spreads across his face, and straight white teeth glare at me. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s so funny?\u201d I say. I shake my head, trying to clear the fog. \u201cI gotta get something to eat. Sugar\u2019s low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t it, darlin\u2019,\u201d Noah says. \u201cRhine?\u201d</p> <p>Just as the words leave Noah\u2019s mouth, I start to fall. The Kansas track playing over the mall\u2019s intercom has been set on repeat, apparently. We\u2019re back to \u201cDust in the Wind.\u201d I fall into Rhine\u2019s arms, and his face is inches from mine. \u201cI love that song,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I wish they\u2019d play \u2018M-M-M-My Sharona.\u2019 The Knack. I love that one, too.\u201d</p><p>His cocky grin is the last thing I see. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>Blackness washes over me, and I feel weightless; voices around me soften, mumble, and weave together until I can\u2019t understand anything anyone is saying. It\u2019s a low hum, vibrating around me. Sleep washes over me, and I float until I feel . . . only peace.</p><p>My eyes flutter open, and a thick white mist floats all around me. The ground is slightly squishy beneath my feet, but still solid. The scent of clover and something else unique and twangy fills the air, my nostrils, and I inhale. I see nothing but the sallow vapor around me. I\u2019m outside. On a slight incline. I\u2019m climbing.</p><p>After a while, I stop and squint, trying to peer through the mist. What am I doing here? Where am I? I continue looking around, searching . . . for something. Or someone. I don\u2019t know right now.</p> <p>Then, ahead, I see a figure. The mist thins enough for me to make out a little. Tall. Wearing all black. Dark hair. Wide stance. Arms hanging at his side. Then he lifts one of those arms and beckons me with his outstretched hand.</p><p>Is it Eli? I think it is. My pace quickens, and I hurry, stumbling up the hill, using my hands now to grab on to clumps of dead heather to pull myself along. Not sure why I don\u2019t just hurl myself upward. I try . . . try to jump, move as fast as my tendencies will allow. They don\u2019t work here. I\u2019m breathless from the climb. I\u2019m just a regular ole human.</p><p>Go figure.</p><p>I\u2019m closer now, and the figure\u2014it\u2019s Eli, I can tell\u2014stands at the top. The wind picks up, catching the tails of his trench and billowing it open, like a black cape, or the outstretched wings of a giant raven. He awaits me. I sense no threat. No hatred. No violence. Only . . . desire.</p><p>I reach the top, and a space of about six feet separates us. The wind tears through the vapor, scattering and swirling it into a mass of white soup around his body, obscuring his face. I step closer. \u201cIs it really you?\u201d I ask. \u201cEli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak,\u201d he says. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p> <p>An uncertainty claws at me, but I\u2019m helpless to stop my feet from advancing toward him. His arms open, like raven wings, and unable to do anything else, I walk into them. His arms close around me, pulling me against his lukewarm body. His hand splays against the back of my head, holding me securely to him. Lips caress my temple. His other hand lowers, caressing my lower back, and then lower still, over my buttocks. When he pulls me against him, his hardened state of arousal is evident as it pushes at my groin. Something worries me; I can\u2019t figure it out. So overcome by finally having his arms around me, I ignore the worry. I only want him. Eli.</p><p>In the next instant, he leans, catching me under my knees, and scoops me up. I still can\u2019t see his face; so much mist. He begins to walk with me, and I rest my head against his chest. It\u2019s hard, muscular, as are the arms that hold me.</p><p>He leaps, and we\u2019re weightless for a few moments, and then he lands solid on the ground, his arms tightening around me. He\u2019s walking now, and I can\u2019t see anything. We stop. A door opens. Creaks as it closes behind us. His footfalls sound against a hard floor, echoing in my ears. It almost sounds as though we\u2019re in a tunnel.</p><p>I try to open my eyes. I want to see. We\u2019re inside now, so the mist can\u2019t obscure. I try to speak, but my throat tightens. I can\u2019t talk. I can\u2019t move. Panic seizes me, and I feel my heart pound. Adrenaline surges within me as my alarm rises. I\u2019m paralyzed.</p><p>\u201cShh, shh,\u201d he soothes. He presses his lips to my temple, and it calms me.</p><p>He continues to walk with me, and now we\u2019re moving up. Stairs. We\u2019re climbing now, and finally, we level once more and he moves with me down a corridor. I inhale, and all I can smell is his spicy scent. It\u2019s . . . somewhat familiar. A door opens. Closes.</p><p>He lowers me, my back sinking into a soft, downy bed. I can see now, but the room is cast in shadows. No candles. No lamps. Only a sliver of moonlight through the small crack in the drapes across the room. I can see his silhouette. He pulls his arms out of his trench, drops it to the floor. His fingers begin to unbutton his shirt, and soon he drops it, too. I see only his outline. He\u2019s bare from the waist up.</p><p>When he moves over me, his body settles over mine. A heavy, muscular thigh wedges between my legs, pushing them apart. Bracing his weight on his elbows, his hands on either side of my head, he slants his mouth over mine and kisses me.</p> <p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d he commands in a whisper against my lips.</p><p>Unable to stop myself, I do as he says. My hands encircle his back and trail up his spine, and the muscles bunch beneath my fingertips. He deepens the kiss, tasting my lips with his tongue, then moving his mouth to my throat. His groin grinds against me, his erection hard against my thigh, and his hand moves from my head to my breast, lowering over my stomach until his hand finds my skin beneath my tank. Over my ribs, he pulls my bra aside to find more skin, and caresses me. His mouth finds mine once more, and he kisses me hard, frenzied, and panic seizes me once more.</p><p>Something is terribly, terribly wrong.</p><p>He lifts his head then, leaving my lips. His hand covers my breast. His heavy cock pushes against me.</p><p>The moonlight catches enough of his profile for me to see.</p><p>Shock.</p><p>Fury.</p><p>Panic.</p><p>With all of my might, I shove him off, and I leap up. Free at last.</p><p>He leaps, too. He\u2019s off the bed. Standing, backing away from me, wordless.</p><p>Anger surges inside me, and I lunge\u2014</p><p>\u201cFook me!\u201d a voice grunts beneath me as we hit the floor. My vision is foggy at first, but soon starts to clear. I stare at the figure below me. I blink several times. It\u2019s getting clearer now.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I mutter, and scramble off Rhine, who I\u2019ve got pinned beneath me on the floor of my room at the Crachan. I extend a hand. \u201cRhine, I\u2019m sorry! Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Rhine grabs my hand and I yank him up. The fool is grinning at me.</p><p>Grinning.</p><p>\u201cAye, ya did,\u201d he says, still smiling. \u201cBut I was warned.\u201d He rubs his jaw, his eyes locked on to mine. \u201c\u2019Twas worth it, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still somewhat dazed; I glance around the room, at the window. Light gray spills from behind the drapes. It\u2019s daylight. Late afternoon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out for forty-six hours,\u201d Rhine explains. \u201cThat\u2019s some bloody dream you were havin\u2019 there.\u201d</p><p>I walk to the window and pull the drapes aside. Cars and pedestrians are moving along the street at the end of the Crachan\u2019s entrance. I turn my head and look at Rhine.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I say.</p><p>Rhine rubs his chin and walks to me. He ducks his head. \u201cYou dinnae remember what you just did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared to ask.\u201d</p><p>Rhine chuckles, a throaty, guy sound. \u201cMiles warned me no\u2019 tae wake you, but you yelled. I came in, and you were breathin\u2019 hard, like you were angry, and trapped maybe.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI shook you, called your name.\u201d He grins now. \u201cNext thing I know, you\u2019ve got me on the floor. Like I said . . .\u201d His smile widens. \u201c\u2019Twas worth it.\u201d</p><p>My mind searches, scrambles to make sense.</p><p>All at once, it hits me. My dream.</p><p>I pray it was a dream.</p><p>Panic seizes me. Panic and a deep, cellular fury.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Eli.</p><p>I fly to the door and yank it open.</p><p>\u201cEh, Riley?\u201d</p><p>I turn and look over my shoulder at Rhine, still standing at the window. His eyes lower, down my body, then back up. \u201cNo\u2019 that I\u2019m no\u2019 appreciatin\u2019 the beauty o\u2019 it, but I\u2019m feelin\u2019 a bit stingy and unsharing.\u201d He inclines his head toward me. \u201cDinnae ya want tae get some clothes on?\u201d</p><p>Only now, when I glance down at myself, do I realize I\u2019m standing in my Crachan room, with Rhine at the window, staring like a hungry wolf, in only my sports bra and boy shorts panties.</p><p>Jesus H. Christ.</p><p>I rush over to my duffel and start yanking out clothes. My mind wonders briefly who exactly pulled the other ones off me, and I quickly push the thought aside.</p><p>I\u2019ve got new worries now. Newer and bigger.</p><p>\u201cThat is . . . simply amazin\u2019,\u201d Rhine says.</p><p>I look at him. He\u2019s staring at my back. I turn to my duffel, pull out a pair of soft, old, faded jeans, complete with raggedy holes, and pull them on. \u201cThanks,\u201d I answer. I\u2019ve got other things on my mind, though, and Rhine\u2019s appreciation of my inked dragon is not top priority. Finding a white long-sleeved tee, I yank it over my head and stuff my arms into the sleeves. Turning, I sit on the bed and start pulling on clean socks. \u201cWhere\u2019s Noah?\u201d I ask. Spying my boots, I grab them, yank them on, and pull the zipper on each.</p><p>\u201cOch, he just went out,\u201d Rhine says. \u201cAs in fell asleep. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks.</p><p>My dream washes over me as I stand, and it almost makes me dizzy.</p><p>No way is this happening.</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d Rhine says. He\u2019s moved closer. Concern lights his green eyes.</p><p>I shake my head and go to my weapons duffel. I pull on my leather holster and start loading my sheaths with blades. I shove one in its place at my ribs, and I look at Rhine. \u201cThat dream? It included an unwanted and unexpected intruder.\u201d I shove the last blade in and find my jacket draped over the end of the bed. I pull it on. \u201cI gotta fix it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhoa, lass,\u201d Rhine says, and moves to block me at the door. \u201cNoah made me swear that I\u2019d watch o\u2019er ya whilst he sleeps.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYou ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere wi\u2019out me.\u201d</p><p>I see the determination in Rhine\u2019s eyes. I also know that I can render him paralyzed if I want to. But maybe it\u2019s not a bad idea to have a backup? Might prevent me from what I\u2019m not too sure I can\u2019t restrain myself from doing.</p><p>Killing the fucker from my dream.</p> <p>Just thinking it makes me boil inside with fury.</p><p>\u201cHow long\u2019s Noah been out?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m standing in front of Rhine now.</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour and a half,\u201d he answers.</p><p>His eyes search mine curiously. I know he\u2019s trying to figure me out. Wondering if I\u2019m going to throw some crazy hoodoo whammy on him. It\u2019s damn tempting, but I don\u2019t. Instead, I give him a nod. \u201cCome on. I can use the backup. Just you and me, though. No Ness boys this time.\u201d</p><p>Rhine studies me hard for a second or two, then opens the door. \u201cAye, the two o\u2019 us, then.\u201d He heads out into the hallway. My eyes drift across, to Noah\u2019s closed door. My hand is reaching for the knob now, and I open and step into his room.</p> <p>Noah\u2019s crashed on the bed, under the covers like some regular ole human, bare from the waist up. One arm is resting across his abdomen. His chest doesn\u2019t rise and fall with breath; I still can\u2019t grasp that sometimes. I stare at his face, so peaceful and still. Long lashes brush his flawless skin. Sun-bleached dreads hang loose around his shoulders.</p><p>He\u2019s not waking anytime soon. Unlike what most humans believe, vampires don\u2019t hunt all night and sleep all day. The ones I know only have a few hours of rest every few days or so. Sometimes daily, depending. Noah hasn\u2019t rested in . . . I can\u2019t remember when. A long time. He may sleep for hours now.</p><p>And what I have to do can\u2019t wait.</p><p>He\u2019ll be so pissed.</p><p>He\u2019ll get over it.</p><p>I back out of Noah\u2019s room and quietly close the door. In the hallway, Rhine waits. Wordlessly, we start up the corridor and hit the steps at the same time. Downstairs, the flat-screen is on. Three Ness boys sit on the sofa and chair. I pause when I see the movie they\u2019re watching. E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial. Memories from my youth, before I turned into a wild child, crash over me. My mom sitting on the sofa in our little apartment, watching it with me.</p> <p>\u201cGreat picture,\u201d Rhine says beside me. \u201cOne o\u2019 my favorites.\u201d</p><p>I look at him and grin. \u201cCintus Suprimus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZero Charisma.\u201d He gives me a crooked smile.</p><p>I\u2019m impressed that Rhine, who is at least eight years younger than me, can quote one of my favorite random quotes from a favorite movie. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>When we get outside, the sky is still light, with fading lavender and gray hues. I start toward the drive.</p><p>\u201cI got a better idea,\u201d Rhine says, and inclines his head toward the row of motorcycles parked on the side of the Crachan. \u201cSince it\u2019s just the two o\u2019 us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I agree, and start toward the bikes.</p><p>What is it about me and guys and bikes?</p> <p>Rhine swaggers up to a black Harley, straddles the seat, and turns the key. He starts the engine and it rumbles to life. With his legs, he pushes it backward and stops where I\u2019m standing. \u201cGet on,\u201d he instructs. He pulls on a helmet and pushes a pair of shades on and hands me a helmet off one of the other bikes.</p><p>I strap it on, straddle the seat behind him, find the foot pegs, and slide my arms around his waist.</p><p>He turns his head. \u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCity center,\u201d I say without hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019ll park and walk from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Rhine says, and clicks the gears. He takes off down the drive and turns the bike toward Inverness\u2019s city center.</p><p>My mind races as Rhine weaves through traffic. The sun, previously hidden by the looming Scottish winter skies, cracks through now, just a golden orange thread between shades of purple and gray. The wind hits my face, and it\u2019s brisk and biting, and I inhale deeply. Rhine\u2019s body is hard and warm. I can hear the thumping of his young, healthy heart. Humanity. Something I sorely miss. I squeeze tighter, and his head tilts slightly toward me in response. I hope I\u2019m not sending the wrong signals to him. I just feel a sense of vulnerability overcome me that I want squashed out. I don\u2019t want to feel it. I want to do what I have to do, fix what needs fixing, and be the hell done with all of this. I want to sit back and watch E.T., eat some pizza, and not worry about the safety of others. I want Eli beside me. I want him out of whatever hell he\u2019s in.</p><p>Jesus, I miss him.</p><p>My heart aches, like someone is physically squeezing the life out of it.</p><p>Rhine pulls his bike along the curb and stops it. I dismount and take off my helmet. He stays straddled and tugs his helmet off and hooks it on the handlebars.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks. He takes his shades off. The late afternoon is fast turning into an early Scottish winter\u2019s eve. Dark at four thirty. That\u2019s such bullshit. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>I glance around, taking in my surroundings. We\u2019re on a side street, close to High Street. There are pedestrians moving about. Mostly locals. I\u2019ve learned to tell them apart now. Tourists are more, I don\u2019t know . . . colorful. And the expression of the locals is different. Friendly, but unimpressed. If that makes any sense. \u201cI will be.\u201d Looking at him now, I sigh. \u201cBelieve it or not, I\u2019m actually glad you came with me. Sometimes I really need a warm-blooded, human hug.\u201d</p><p>That sounds stupid as hell. But I had to say it.</p><p>Rhine grins. \u201cOy, what do ya know? I\u2019m warm-blooded and human.\u201d He winks. \u201cHug me anytime ya get the urge, lass.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and fight a grin. I feel like I\u2019ve got two Noahs now. I give in and smile, then glance up the street. Then I study Rhine. He has to know what\u2019s going on. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to keep it from him. I sigh. \u201cWhat we\u2019re walking into here is a nightmare, Rhine. This vampire? I\u2019ve dealt with him before. He was the first one to poison me with his Strigoi venom, back in Savannah. He didn\u2019t want me dead, though. He wanted to keep me. Make me become his mate. And I\u2019m pretty damn sure now he\u2019s behind everything here. Carrine, Eli\u2014it\u2019s him. Valerian Arcos. He\u2019s powerful as all holy hell. Just so you know.\u201d</p><p>Rhine\u2019s eyes shine with understanding. \u201cAye, I\u2019ll keep all that in mind. But I willna leave ya, lass.\u201d</p><p>With a nod and a deep breath, I focus. Everything around me goes silent, and blurry. I hear and see no one. I\u2019m singling out one in specific. Like flipping through the channels on satellite, my mind spins and spins.</p><p>Then I\u2019ve got him.</p><p>The hairs on my neck stiffen, and I stare down High Street. Past the double arches of McDonald\u2019s, a sidewalk caf\u00e9. The shade of the building falls over the sidewalk tables, but he\u2019s there. I sense him.</p><p>And he senses me, too.</p><p>He knows I\u2019ve come.</p><p>I\u2019m sure he knew it all along. He\u2019s controlling everything. Every goddamn thing.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d I say to Rhine, and I start up the street. Past several storefronts, past McDonald\u2019s, past the tartan shop, I walk steadily toward the outdoor caf\u00e9. The only sound I hear is my boots making contact with the sidewalk. I vaguely see Rhine, slightly behind and beside me. I know he\u2019s not going anywhere. It would\u2019ve been useless to try and get him to stay behind. Knowing him, he would\u2019ve chanced waking a sleeping vampire, just to make sure I wasn\u2019t stepping into danger.</p><p>I may still be.</p><p>But I don\u2019t think so.</p><p>At the caf\u00e9, our eyes meet. I know he\u2019s watched me, from the moment I turned into view. Seeing him here, now, is slightly shocking. Infuriating. Disgusting. My hands clench at my sides into fists. Fury boils inside me.</p><p>I walk directly to the table, and before I realize it, Rhine is pulling the seat out for me. I sit down. He stands behind me, his hand on my shoulder. A few other tables are occupied by humans. All of them sipping tea and coffee, having a bite to eat, chatting. Wrapping up their day. None of them have any suspicion that a coldhearted murderer is in their midst.</p><p>I\u2019m looking at the one sitting at the table, facing me.</p><p>A smile touches his mouth. His chocolate brown eyes soften as they stare directly into mine. His dark hair is pulled back into a perfect ponytail. His features are flawless.</p><p>He\u2019s a monster inside all of that beauty.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d he says seductively. He draws a deep, exaggerated breath, as if air could move through those lifeless lungs. He spares Rhine a brief glance before lowering his gaze back to me. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to bring along a chaperone.\u201d</p><p>Rhine\u2019s grip tightens on my shoulder. It comforts me.</p><p>I steady my gaze directly into that of Valerian Arcos. \u201cDoes your father know you\u2019re here?\u201d I ask. \u201cOr your brother?\u201d</p><p>An easy smile falls on Valerian\u2019s full lips. \u201cOf course not. Why would I tell them such?\u201d His gaze drops to my breasts, then back up. \u201cAnd have them ruin our time together?\u201d</p><p>Fury seethes within me, and I briefly focus on one mind. Vic, your brother is here in Inverness. I can\u2019t talk right now, but you need to know. And warn your father. I may very well kill the fucker. \u201cWe\u2019ll have no time together,\u201d I say calmly. \u201cWhat do you want here, Valerian? You\u2019re breaking serious codes, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCodes my father and ridiculous little brother vowed to uphold,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cNot me. Besides,\u201d he says, his voice lowering, \u201cI\u2019ve come for a much different reason than you think.\u201d</p><p>I cock my head and study him. \u201cI\u2019m not a helpless human you can push around,\u201d I remind him. \u201cSo you\u2019d better tell me what it is you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have fucked you in your sleep, love,\u201d Valerian corrects, interrupts. His voice is low, almost crooning. And it\u2019s all matter-of-fact. \u201cYou enjoyed every touch, every swipe of my tongue. You liked it. And you were powerless to fight me.\u201d He smiles. \u201cBut you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tension building in Rhine\u2019s body surges through him to his fingertips, where his grip tightens.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always known that about you, Valerian,\u201d I say. \u201cI know something else, too.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and strokes his chin. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>I lean forward, my gaze locked with his, and run my fingertip over his knuckles. \u201cThat you\u2019re such a pussy, the only way you can get inside girls\u2019 panties is in a dream.\u201d</p><p>Valerian\u2019s face hardens, for the briefest of seconds. Then he smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s what I adore most about you, Riley Poe. Crass American that you are, you\u2019ve got that special, oh, I don\u2019t know . . .\u201d He in turn grasps my hand with his. \u201cFuck appeal. It\u2019s terribly irresistible.\u201d</p><p>I yank my hand away.</p><p>Rhine moves forward, and I reach up and grasp his hand with mine. It stops him. His heart is pounding a mile a minute. Fury rolls off him in waves. I know Valerian notices it. And of course, he doesn\u2019t even acknowledge it. Arrogant bastard.</p><p>\u201cBut as I insisted before, that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here,\u201d he says, and leans back in his chair. He\u2019s dressed in head-to-toe black. His skin clashes seductively. \u201cYou see, I\u2019m so enamored of you that I cannot sit back and watch you be killed mercilessly. \u2019Twould be . . . quite a loss.\u201d</p> <p>I narrow my gaze. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>His smile is cold. \u201cYour fianc\u00e9, Riley. You do realize there\u2019s no saving him now, hmm?\u201d He leans forward again. \u201cHe\u2019s partaken of too much human blood, love. He\u2019s awash with it. He can no more control it than you can control me. His vampiric brain is crazed. He doesn\u2019t know you anymore. Or his family. He knows only the female. And his next meal. And I can promise you, my love. No root doctor potion can fix him now.\u201d His brown eyes soften as he looks at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put him out of his misery.\u201d</p><p>Valerian\u2019s words hit me hard. I fight not to gasp. \u201cWhere are you getting your meals from?\u201d I ask. \u201cAnd since when do you care enough about Eli\u2019s misery to want it ended? And what do you know of the female?\u201d Carrine\u2019s words ring in my ear. \u201cYou see, I\u2019m under intense orders myself. My savior freed me from my prison. \u2019Tis the verra reason I\u2019m even walking the Earth again. I have no choice but to wait.\u201d</p><p>Valerian gives a slight shrug. \u201cI\u2019m merely en route to my destination and thought to stop by and encourage you,\u201d he says. \u201cLike I mentioned before, I hate to see such fine fucking material as yourself wasted. And if you wait too long, trying to\u201d\u2014he waves his hand in the air\u2014\u201csave Dupr\u00e9\u2019s soul, you will get killed yourself.\u201d His eyes turn molten. \u201cAnd I truly do hate that thought.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve only fed once since my arrival. I\u2019m not greedy, you know, but I must survive.\u201d</p><p>I pin Arcos with a glare. \u201cYou freed Carrine, didn\u2019t you? And you\u2019ve given her orders to control Eli.\u201d I cock my head, staring. \u201cWhy? Why go through all that? If you simply wanted me, why not just take me? And how did Victorian end up in Romania? How did he simply vanish from the forest?\u201d I draw closer to him. \u201cWhat are you, some fucking magical fairy bloodsucker?\u201d</p><p>Valerian\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t change. His chocolate eyes lock on to mine and he stares. \u201cThat female he\u2019s with? She\u2019s a witch, no?\u201d He shrugs. \u201cMaybe she used her magic to send my brother back home. Perhaps you should ask her all of your questions. I don\u2019t have the answers.\u201d</p> <p>Anger rages through me, and I grab his arm. His eyes light up with interest. \u201cLeave here, Arcos,\u201d I warn. \u201cAnd don\u2019t touch another human.\u201d I rise and lean over the table. \u201cI will kill you myself.\u201d</p><p>Valerian\u2019s brown gaze flashes at the challenge; then he chuckles softly. \u201cOh, Riley. How easily you forget.\u201d He looks at me. Turn your lovely self around and kiss that paltry human boy you\u2019ve brought along with you. Go on. Do it.</p><p>I turn where I stand, slip my hand around Rhine\u2019s neck, and pull his mouth to mine. I kiss him, deeply.</p><p>Do you see the power I still possess? You may stop now. The sight sickens me. I simply wanted to prove myself to you. Now you must kill Dupr\u00e9. He\u2019ll only hurt you in the end. Kill you. Dead. Do what you wish to his lover.</p><p>I pull away from Rhine\u2019s mouth. His eyes are glued to mine, green flashing curiosity. I turn and look at Valerian.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Arcos,\u201d I say, and I move away. \u201cI\u2019ve known what has to be done since I arrived here. Now leave Inverness,\u201d I warn. \u201cBefore I call the House of Arcos and tell Daddy what you\u2019re up to.\u201d I won\u2019t tell him I\u2019ve already sent word home to Vic. Better if they surprise him.</p><p>Valerian casts an unworried smile. \u201cAs I said, I\u2019m just passing through. Heading to Ireland for a jaunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too close,\u201d I advise. \u201cGo farther. And stay out of my head.\u201d</p> <p>Valerian chuckles. \u201cOr what, pray tell?\u201d</p><p>I edge closer to Valerian\u2019s chair and straddle his lap. In my peripheral I notice several bypassers and other caf\u00e9goers turn their glances toward me.</p><p>I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Valerian\u2019s eyes widen as my hand pushes open his black woolen coat. His stomach is hard, lined with lean muscle. Not bulky strong. Just . . . well, aristocratic strong, if that makes sense. I let my hand move over his ribs, distracting him.</p><p>My other hand grasps the silver blade tucked into my boot and I lift it.</p><p>One hand on his crotch.</p><p>His eyes turn darker.</p><p>My other hand goes to his heart with the blade.</p><p>Just that fast, Valerian\u2019s eyes flash the tiniest bit of fear. Just before they ice over.</p><p>I smile. \u201cSo you see,\u201d I say, and press the blade just a little harder, beneath his coat. I grab his crotch harder, too. \u201cI\u2019m not the pushover you think I am.\u201d I lean my mouth to his ear. \u201cI could end you right now, Arcos. It\u2019d be so easy.\u201d I move my face in front of his, our eyes inches apart. \u201cAnd all I did was use a little bit of pure, unadulterated human female skill.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me. \u201cThat, my love, would be a mistake,\u201d he advises. \u201cOne day, you may just seek my help.\u201d</p><p>I slip my blade back into my boot and get up. \u201cI highly doubt that. Now go. Tonight. Or I\u2019ll make the call. Not just to your father. But to Eli\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Again, a tinge of fear replaces the cocky spark of fire in Valerian\u2019s brown eyes. He gives a slight nod. \u201cVery well. You\u2019ll see what I mean soon enough,\u201d he warns. He spares Rhine a glance. \u201cPerhaps your little human friends can keep you safe enough.\u201d He smiles. \u201cFor a while.\u201d He rises from the table and buttons his woolen coat up to the throat. He stands in front of me now, looks down at me, and I briefly wonder why vampires are so goddamn beautiful. What a waste.</p><p>His smile bares straight white teeth. \u201cVery well, my dear Riley. I\u2019m on my way. But if you need me at all, please . . .\u201d He lifts my hand and brushes his lukewarm lips over my skin. \u201cCall me. I will hasten to be by your side.\u201d</p><p>With one last lingering stare, he gives a slight bow, turns, and heads down High Street. I stare at him until the shadows swallow him up.</p><p>Then he\u2019s gone.</p><p>And I mean gone. Just that fast, he\u2019s out of Inverness. On foot, I sense his presence getting farther and farther away. I can\u2019t believe he even dared approach me. Or maybe he really is stupid enough to pull all that shit and not think I would eventually recognize him?</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>I turn and meet Rhine\u2019s gaze. A sheepish expression crosses his face, and he smiles. \u201cDo . . . you remember wha\u2019 you just did?\u201d</p><p>I smile and punch his arm. It\u2019s funny to me that Rhine\u2019s brogue is void of the letter t. \u201cYou mean that kiss? Yeah, I knew I was doing it.\u201d I incline my head in the direction of Valerian. \u201cBut it\u2019s better if we let him think he made me do it. I may never have gotten rid of him otherwise.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes flash. \u201cI\u2019m no\u2019 sure if I like the idea of you doing it unawares, or on purpose.\u201d</p><p>I smile and we start back toward the bike. \u201cI can\u2019t let everyone know all of my secrets,\u201d I say. \u201cHad Valerian realized he wasn\u2019t overpowering me, I may not have been able to slip inside his head like I did.\u201d I knock shoulders with him. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to use you, Rhine. For what it\u2019s worth, you are a fab kisser.\u201d</p><p>Rhine cuts his eyes at me and shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that a time or two,\u201d he admits. \u201cNever by an older lass, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch how you say that word older,\u201d I warn. \u201cI\u2019m fast creepin\u2019 toward thirty and not liking it much.\u201d</p><p>When we get to Rhine\u2019s bike, he throws his leg over it and sits for a moment, staring at me. The sun has dropped now, and a streetlight casts his face in half shadow. He watches me, studying me closely. I\u2019m sorely tempted to slip back inside his brain, just to see what he\u2019s thinking.</p><p>But I don\u2019t.</p><p>Finally, he shakes his head. \u201cGet on.\u201d</p><p>We pull our helmets on, and I crawl onto the back of the bike and wrap my arms around Rhine\u2019s middle. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a vampire to awak- en,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd trust me when I say shit\u2019s about to hit the fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it,\u201d he says, and pulls into traffic.</p><p>Oh yeah. Shit is definitely about to hit the fan.</p><p>What Arcos doesn\u2019t know certainly won\u2019t hurt him.</p><p>And I\u2019ve got a wealth of information, just from our little caf\u00e9 chat.</p><p>And I love that he doesn\u2019t even know the secrets he gave to me.</p><p>That\u2019s what he gets for fucking with a human with vampiric tendencies.</p><p>And a little fallen angel dust, thrown in to boot.</p><p>Part Seven</p><p> SOULLESS</p><p>This one, this one right here. This was my dream, my wish. And it didn\u2019t come true. So I\u2019m taking it back. I\u2019m taking them all back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2014Mouth, The Goonies, 1985</p><p>Oh, dat girl of mine. She crazy in da head and gonna git herself kilt if she don\u2019t look out. I\u2019m worried about dat Eli, too. I think he might be too far gone for even me to help him, that\u2019s right. He done slipped way into dat mess of bloodlust. My baby girl might have to make a choice she ain\u2019t gonna like too much. If she does, well, den, we will have to go and get her. No tellin\u2019 what she\u2019ll do.</p><p>\u2014Preacher</p> <p>The second we walk into the Crachan, I can tell Noah is still asleep.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what it is, or how I can sense it. It\u2019s just one of those qualities I\u2019ve acquired that have no rhyme or reason in my human brain. Which is really a joke, considering. As if anything in my world makes sense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to wake him,\u201d I tell Rhine. \u201cBe right down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Rhine answers, and disappears through the hall.</p><p>I hit the stairs and take them two at a time. One plus for long legs, I guess. I take the corridor at a jog and ease into Noah\u2019s room.</p> <p>I\u2019m not prepared for what\u2014or who\u2014I see sitting in the chair against the wall, opposite Noah\u2019s bed.</p><p>My little baby brother.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d I choke out. I hurry to him, and at the same time he rises and launches at me, full weight. I catch him, and we embrace.</p><p>I\u2019m shocked we\u2019re no longer eye to eye. Rather, I have to look up at him. And I\u2019m wearing spike-heeled boots.</p><p>\u201cRi!\u201d he says into my neck. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you!\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I forget all the craziness that\u2019s become my world, forget vampires, blood, silver blades, and saving humans. I just inhale the familiar scent and feel of my little brother. I squeeze him tightly, and it takes me back to . . . before. That in-between time when I ran Inksomnia with my best friend, Nyx, and I tattooed for a living, and ordered Chinese food and had low-country boils with my Gullah family. I let it engulf me, for just a minute.</p> <p>Then I pull back and scowl up at my brother.</p><p>My eyes widen. \u201cHoly crap, Seth.\u201d I finger his chin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got freaking whiskers!\u201d</p><p>Seth Poe grins, and the fact that he\u2019s now almost seventeen blows me away. His dark hair is close-cut, like Eli\u2019s brother Phin. Nicely arched dark eyebrows frame green eyes, just like mine, with long lashes most girls envy. But there\u2019s a hardness about him now that wasn\u2019t there before. In a way, I\u2019m glad. He\u2019s strong, and he\u2019s grown.</p><p>And in another way, it saddens me. Innocence gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been growing whiskers for a year now,\u201d Seth says.</p><p>\u201cFour single whiskers do not count, bro,\u201d I remind him, and he grins. \u201cWhat are you doing here anyway?\u201d I stare at my brother, amazed at his physique. Although his are not nearly as severe as mine, he, too has tendencies. Strigoi tendencies. It\u2019s what started all of this hell. Seth, on a dare by his pain-in-the-ass buddies, accidentally set free the entombed and deadly Arcos brothers. Seth was then drawn into Valerian\u2019s Lost Boys\u2019 cult in Savannah, and . . . Jesus Christ, I almost lost him.</p><p>Thanks to Eli and his family, he was saved.</p><p>And we realized Victorian Arcos wasn\u2019t nearly as lethal as his brother, Valerian.</p> <p>It\u2019s been quite a hellish ride ever since.</p><p>\u201cYour inspection of me, Ri, is kinda creepin\u2019 me out,\u201d Seth says with a grin. \u201cAnyway . . .\u201d He takes both my shoulders in his hands. \u201cI kept having this bad feeling about you here,\u201d he admits. \u201cPreacher did, too. So he and Eli\u2019s dad sent me.\u201d</p><p>Eli. God Almighty, just hearing his name hurts. And saying what I have to say will hurt even more. \u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, why are there so many Poes in my room?\u201d Noah says, awakened. He\u2019s sitting up now, still in bed. Dreads all over the place. He leaps from beneath the covers and, thank God, he\u2019s wearing a pair of black workout pants. He\u2019s barefoot, and in two steps he and Seth meet in the middle of the room. Noah pulls my brother into a fierce bear hug.</p><p>\u201cWhat in Sam Hill are you doing here, boy?\u201d Noah asks Seth. Noah\u2019s Charleston drawl is appealing, and a little sensual. Especially when he\u2019s serious. It gets, I don\u2019t know . . . stronger. Almost like the old Noah, prevampirism, Revolutionary War Noah, is there, in his voice. Appealing.</p><p>Seth shrugs. \u201cI got a bad feeling.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cAbout her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tends to stir that feeling in almost everyone she meets,\u201d Noah says. He\u2019s looking at me hard now, and I can tell he knows something\u2019s up.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know to come here?\u201d I finally ask.</p><p>Seth looks at me. \u201cJake Andorra told me you were in Inverness. Once I got here . . .\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI first went to the guesthouse you were supposed to be staying in. When you weren\u2019t there, I just walked around until I . . . sensed you. I guess we look enough alike that the guys who were here let me in.\u201d His eyes are questioning now. \u201cWhat is it you have to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Eli,\u201d I say, and my throat constricts. I\u2019m keeping focused, not dwelling on the fact that the very soul I love with all my might is the same one who\u2019s turned dark, killing innocents, and doing so has made it almost seem surreal. To explain it? Say it out loud?</p><p>Pain. Deep, throbbing pain that starts in my gut and twists up my spine, to my throat and grabs on so fiercely I find it hard to even breathe normally.</p><p>But I do.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Eli?\u201d Seth asks.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s turned, Seth,\u201d Noah answers for me. \u201cFor the very worst.\u201d</p><p>I look at Noah first, and I know he sees the appreciation in my eyes. Seth sits down in the chair he\u2019d been in when I first walked in, and I finish telling him everything about Inverness. About how I\u2019d gone into the alternative realm, dragged both Victorian and Eli out, and saved them. How Victorian had ended up back in Romania. And how Eli had grown fond of human blood, and Carrine. The killings. The Ness boys, and Rhine. Everything. My little brother sits in stunned silence the whole time I speak.</p><p>Then I have to tell both Noah and Seth the latest.</p><p>About Valerian Arcos.</p><p>Now I have two pair of stormy eyes staring at me. One green. The other pure liquid silver.</p><p>Both mad as hell.</p><p>Noah speaks first. \u201cWhat the hell, Riley?\u201d he says. \u201cYou knew it was him and you went anyway?\u201d</p><p>I shoot a glance at Seth. He\u2019s waiting on an answer, too.</p><p>\u201cI took Rhine with me,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cNo, Rhine insisted on going because I made him swear he would watch out for you while I slept,\u201d Noah corrected.</p><p>\u201cNah, that\u2019s no\u2019 exactly right, either,\u201d Rhine says from the doorway. \u201cI\u2019d have gone, no matter what.\u201d He eyes Seth for a moment.</p><p>\u201cRhine MacLeod, my little brother, Seth Poe,\u201d I introduce. Rhine walks over and shakes Seth\u2019s hand.</p><p>The two look each other over, and Seth nods. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tendencies.\u201d</p><p>Rhine nods in return. \u201cSome.\u201d He glances at Noah. \u201cShe kissed me.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s brow lifts. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, glare at Rhine, and sigh. \u201cClarification. I had to make Valerian think he had one over on me so he would leave. He instructed me to do it.\u201d I slide a sideways glance at Rhine. \u201cSo I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did he want?\u201d Seth asks. \u201cDoes his father know he\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI slipped Victorian the message, but Valerian doesn\u2019t know that. Anyway, when I threatened to tell his dad, he didn\u2019t seem overly concerned. He basically told me that Eli was far gone\u2014too far for help. And that I needed to kill him before he killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he mention the female?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>Again, I nod. \u201cSaid she\u2019s just some female latched on to Eli. But I think he knows a lot more than what he\u2019s letting on. Carrine told me at Eastgate that her savior had freed her of her prison. That she was basically under his command. Could be Valerian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we know she\u2019s a witchpire,\u201d Rhine adds. He looks at Seth. \u201cWitch. Vampire. Old as bloody hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Valerian wanted his presence known,\u201d I say. \u201cHe claims he\u2019s killed only one innocent here in Inverness.\u201d I look at Seth. \u201cSo far there\u2019ve been five. And that\u2019s not including the newbloods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing?\u201d Seth asks. \u201cTo keep the city safe?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Rhine and Noah, then at my brother. \u201cSame thing we were doing in Savannah. Run the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the lot of us, we\u2019re human,\u201d Rhine says. \u201cI\u2019m the only one wi\u2019 any tendencies, and they\u2019re mild compared to your sister\u2019s abilities.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s pacing now, and pulling on a white T-shirt over his head. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d He ties his dreads back with a leather band. \u201cThere\u2019s more to Arcos\u2019s appearance than to simply tell you how much he doesn\u2019t want you to die. He\u2019s full of shit. He knows something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, that\u2019s no\u2019 all he said,\u201d Rhine offers. \u201cHe fancies Riley here.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>Noah makes a sound, almost a swear, in his throat. \u201cI can only imagine. Still,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s something else going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI can sense his absence. He\u2019s gone from Inverness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, unfortunately, Eli is still here,\u201d Noah says. \u201cAnd Carrine. And they have to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just capture Eli and bind him?\u201d Seth asks. \u201cTake him back to Savannah so Preacher can take him to Da Island for detox.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cLike we did with Ri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not Eli?\u201d I offer. I walk to the window and pull the drapes. The city is ablaze with streetlights. The castle is illuminated on the hill. \u201cWhat if the killings continue, even without Eli as a factor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll kill Carrine, too,\u201d Noah offers. \u201cI\u2019ll make a call to Andorra.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMeanwhile,\u201d says Rhine, \u201cwe\u2019ll be hittin\u2019 the streets tonight.\u201d He looks at Seth. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarved,\u201d Seth admits.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s go get some grub.\u201d Rhine inclines his head to the door. \u201cRiley?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down in a sec,\u201d I say, and look at my brother.</p><p>He reads my mind because he comes straight to me, pulls me into another embrace.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, sis,\u201d he says into my hair. \u201cWhatever it takes, we\u2019ll get Eli home and Preacher will make all of this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, bro,\u201d I say.

I\u2019ll be down in just a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Seth says, and leaves with Rhine.</p> <p>\u201cI have to admit, Riley,\u201d Noah says. He\u2019s kicked off his black workout pants and is pulling on a pair of dark jeans. \u201cSomething doesn\u2019t sit right with me about Arcos.\u201d He buttons his fly, his stare remaining on mine. \u201cThere\u2019s just more to it than him slipping into your dreams, then telling you to kill Eli. That\u2019s just . . . too simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer. \u201cWhat motive would he have? Why doesn\u2019t he just kill Eli himself? Why go through all this?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s standing in front of me now, and he taps me on the nose with a forefinger. \u201cBecause, darlin\u2019,\u201d he says. His mercury eyes all but are illuminated. \u201cThat would be a big fucking no-no, now, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d A smile lifts his mouth. \u201cHe can\u2019t touch Eli Dupr\u00e9. The Gullah, not to mention Eli\u2019s entire family, would storm Romania and the House of Arcos would become a bloody vampire battleground. Senior Arcos knows it. And so does Valerian.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. It\u2019s almost too stupid to say out loud. \u201cSo Valerian seriously thinks he can simply put the Arcos whammy on me and make me kill my own fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugs and pulls on his boots. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, indeed.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, grabbing Noah\u2019s leather jacket off the foot of the bed. I watch as he sheathes a few silver blades in the holster he\u2019s now strapping on over his shoulders. \u201cWhether Carrine is commanding the rogues, Eli, or Valerian . . .\u201d I shake my head. \u201cEither way, they have to be stopped. Maybe Eli doesn\u2019t have to die.</p><p>\u201cWhy the rogues? What\u2019s the\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014rationale? If Valerian in fact set free, resurrected, whatever\u2014Carrine, why?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Noah strokes his chin. \u201cMaybe Valerian doesn\u2019t have as much control as he thinks. Or,\u201d he says, meeting my gaze, \u201cmaybe he does, and he\u2019s just a sick bastard who gets off on the chase. The killing of innocents. And it\u2019s no secret he loathes Eli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he set Carrine free in order to use her for her witch powers?\u201d I muse. \u201cValerian mentioned that could be how Vic disappeared and made it back to Romania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d Noah answers.</p><p>I move to stand directly in front of Noah. I look up. \u201cIf there\u2019s even a slight chance of capturing Eli and getting him back to Da Island, we gotta make it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than just us to subdue him,\u201d Noah says. \u201cHe\u2019s . . . full-on rabid, Riley. You were bad enough as a human with tendencies.\u201d Noah takes the jacket from my hands and eases into it. His eyes never leave mine. \u201cWhen we took you to Romania? God Almighty Damn, girl.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cYou nearly tore the plane\u2019s wiring out of the walls. You were some kind of out of control. Can you imagine what a full-blooded, blood-lusted two-hundred-plus-year-old vampire would be like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s strong, Riley. Damn strong,\u201d he says.</p><p>I head to the door and stop, and Noah\u2019s right behind me. I look up. \u201cYou scared?\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cHell yeah, I\u2019m scared.\u201d He shoves his hands into his jacket pocket and spreads it out like a cape, exposing the leather holster, sheaths, and blade hilts. \u201cJust as I\u2019m scared as hell that I\u2019m gonna poke myself with one of these goddamn silver blades and turn to dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn to dust, Noah,\u201d I answer, and we both step out of the room. He closes the door and locks it, and we start up the corridor. Suddenly, I stop.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ll meet you downstairs,\u201d I say, and turn back to my room. \u201cI need to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Noah asks, and starts up the hall. He throws a grin over his shoulder. \u201cCan\u2019t you run in them things?\u201d</p><p>I take a look at the high-leather heeled boots I\u2019m wearing, and shrug. \u201cI can. For a while.\u201d</p><p>Noah waves and hits the staircase. I turn and hurry into my room. I shut the door behind me and walk toward the bedside table. The moment my fingers graze the knob, I freeze. It\u2019s dark, with only a small haze of streetlight shining in through the cracked drapes. The window is open, and cold November Highland air rushes in.</p><p>I\u2019m not alone.</p><p>A sensation washes over me, and slowly, I scan the shadows. I search the other side of the room, and I turn back.</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>Eli is standing in front of me. A foot\u2014twelve inches\u2014is all the space that\u2019s between us. His body is tense\u2014so much I can feel the power rolling off him\u2014and every muscle is rigid, hard. His eyes are red\u2014not the beautiful cerulean I\u2019m used to. But he\u2019s not morphed into his vampirism. Only his eyes are different.</p><p>My vocal cords are frozen. My body is paralyzed. I stare hard at him, wishing him to recognize me. Why is he here? How the hell did he get in here?</p><p>His head cocks to the side, and he\u2019s studying me so hard I feel adrenaline surge through me and realize it\u2019s fear. I want to scan the room. Is Carrine here? Commanding him to kill me? Or to torture me, as Athios had warned? I want to run. I want to call out to him, scream his name, make him see me.</p><p>I want to touch him. So badly it hurts. Maybe if I do, he\u2019ll remember me. He\u2019ll remember us.</p><p>I concentrate. Focus. Holding his bloodred gaze, I breathe in. Out. Slowly, I lift my arm, reach my hand out to him. I\u2019m grabbing blindly, gently when I feel his hand beneath mine.</p><p>For a split second, confusion flashes over Eli\u2019s features. So quick I almost miss it. He could kill me so fast. I\u2019ve seen how swift he turns. It\u2019s little more than a blur, and his jaw extends, jagged teeth drop sharp and white, and he\u2019ll go for my throat. He could snap my head right off like a dandelion. Right now he\u2019s hesitating. And he\u2019s alone. Is his resistance to Carrine\u2019s control strengthening? Is he remembering me?</p><p>I swallow, pushing past my fear. My heart throbs inside my ribs, and I have to concentrate to keep my breathing under control. Staring, willing him to recognize me, I hold my hand against his.</p><p>\u201cEligius Dupr\u00e9,\u201d I whisper. \u201cEli, please, come back to me.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s nostrils flare. His head cocks farther to the side, and his eyebrows pull together into a frown. He\u2019s considering. Studying.</p><p>Or remembering?</p><p>\u201cRiley, what\u2019s the holdup?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s voice startles me, and on instinct, I drop my hand and glance toward the door just as he enters. His face hardens, just that fast.</p><p>I turn my head back to Eli.</p><p>He has disappeared. My eyes move to the window, and the drapes are still fluttering. Hurrying over, I peer out into the night, my eyes searching the shadows, the street, the walk.</p><p>Eli\u2019s gone.</p><p>At the window, I sag against it.</p><p>Noah\u2019s beside me, his hand on my shoulder. \u201cHe could have killed you, Riley.\u201d He squeezes me, his fingers digging into my bones. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop him, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree. \u201cI know that.\u201d I look up at him. \u201cHe hesitated, though. Looked as if he was trying to figure something out.\u201d I shrug. \u201cOr figure me out. Do you think he remembered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to say.\u201d He grasps my jaw gently and turns my face up to his. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s capable of reaching a vampire through a bloodlust phase, it\u2019s you.\u201d He kisses me, a fast brush across the lips. \u201cYou\u2019re kinda unforgettable, you know. And I\u2019d like to keep you around for as long as possible, so if Eli approaches you again, call me.\u201d He taps my temple. \u201cIn here.\u201d He drops his hand and shakes his head. \u201cSwear to God, for a human with so much power, you don\u2019t utilize a third of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I wasn\u2019t thinking,\u201d I admit. \u201cExcept to try and make him see me.\u201d</p><p>Noah chucks me under the chin. \u201cI know.\u201d He inclines his head. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I finish changing, Noah helps me gear up, even though I don\u2019t need the help, and we head out. Downstairs, Seth and Rhine stand together, talking.</p><p>Riley, please. I can barely stand this\u2014being here, and not there. How are you holding up?</p><p>Vic, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve got a little unexpected help from a group of hunters here in Inverness. They\u2019re apt. Kick-ass apt. We\u2019re doing fine. I promise.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, Riley. I don\u2019t like it. I have a horrible feeling about everything. I should come.</p><p>No. You stay put. At least until we get things figured out here. Eli is here, Vic. And he\u2019s not himself. He\u2019s being controlled by a witchpire, of all things.</p><p>Damn me. Haven\u2019t heard that term in quite some time. Please. Don\u2019t be overzealous with your abilities. Keep Miles with you at all times. I beg you.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I have a choice anymore. He\u2019s on me like glue.</p><p>Good. And a warning: The moment I feel you\u2019ve upset the balance of safety there, I\u2019m on the first plane to Inverness. I swear it.</p><p>I\u2019ll keep you posted, Vic.</p><p>You\u2019d better.</p><p>I finish my mind convo with Victorian Arcos and hit the living area. My eyes scan the room. My brother. He\u2019s here. And I haven\u2019t seen him in . . . weeks. Since before Edinburgh. I walk up to him, and he drapes a lean arm around my shoulders and pulls me close. I look up at him. \u201cWe run together tonight, bro,\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLads, you know where tae go,\u201d Rhine says to the twenty or so Ness boys gathered in the hall. A few faces are ones I haven\u2019t seen yet. \u201cRob, Tate, Jep\u2014you\u2019ll run wi\u2019 us.\u201d</p><p>The Ness boys break down into groups and start filing out of the door. Noah walks over to us and places a hand on mine and Seth\u2019s shoulders. He squeezes us both.</p><p>\u201cYou two Poes don\u2019t stir up any extra unwanted trouble,\u201d he warns. \u201cAnd don\u2019t approach Eli or Carrine alone. If you cross paths, call me.\u201d</p> <p>I nod. \u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Arcos\u2014either one\u2014tries to get to you, don\u2019t entertain that, either.\u201d</p><p>I throw Noah a grin. \u201cYes, Mother.\u201d Noah probably never will trust Victorian Arcos, but I do. He\u2019s on our side, and I don\u2019t think he ever was as evil as everyone claims. I feel lighter now. More hopeful. The possibility that Eli is trying to resist Carrine lifts my spirits. I want to save him. So bad.</p><p>Noah waves and disappears out the door. We\u2019re right behind him.</p><p>Outside, the air is cold and the wind brisk; a fine mist falls, and I pull my hair into a ponytail. Scanning the front of the Crachan\u2019s lot, I notice Noah\u2019s already disappeared with his group. With Rhine in the lead, we head off.</p> <p>We run the city for four hours before I notice anything. Seth and I have scaled a row of buildings, and we leap the rooftops as Rhine, Tate, Rob, and Jep jog the sidewalk below. It\u2019s just after ten p.m. I stop, listening.</p><p>Seth stops, too. The thigh-length leather coat he\u2019s wearing conceals as many silver blades as I have on me. A skully keeps his hair plastered down. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I lift my chin, smell the air, zone all city noises out. Streetlights illuminate side streets, and I cast a glance over the cityscape. Coned turrets and spires from the city center jab the air, and the castle sits light up on the hill, holding sentry over the city.</p><p>But something\u2019s not right.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Seth asks again. He, too, scans the skyline.</p><p>I shake my head, stare at the rooftop under my feet. I close my eyes.</p> <p>Then I hear it. Not a faint word, but a voice, in my head.</p><p>Ah, ma ch\u00e8re. There you are. Bon. I want you to remember something very important, oui?</p><p>My eyes flutter open, then shut again; I\u2019m desperate not to lose what was happening.</p><p>\u201cRiley, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Seth says at my side. He grabs my chin and forces me to look at him. I do, but I smile, press two fingers to his lips to silence him, and close my eyes.</p><p>Yes, ma ch\u00e8re, there you go. I need your complete concentration to speak with you as such.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dupr\u00e9,\u201dI say in my head. \u201cYou could\u2019ve just called me on my cell.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s father chuckles. \u201cNow, what good is having such fine, combined inhuman tendencies if not to use them thusly? My dear girl, I won\u2019t keep you long, but I want you to know only this. My son loves you deeply\u2014more than his own existence. Never has he given his heart away to another, since our human life. Only to you. And other than my love for my beloved wife, I\u2019ve never seen another vampire love so completely. If anyone can dredge him from the hell he is in and save him, it is you, my darling. Remember the blood coursing through you is filled with more than simply Arcos\u2019s Strigoi. You have Dupr\u00e9 in you as well. You always will. Bring my son home, ma ch\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Mr. Dupr\u00e9. I swear it,\u201d I answer. \u201cI . . . ache inside without him. All the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, well, that\u2019s because he\u2019s the other half of your soul, ch\u00e8re. You, us, and what we are? It was meant to be. From the very start. Take care now, and stay close to that Miles boy. He\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Strong hands are shaking my shoulders with violent force.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d Rhine growls.</p><p>I ignore him for a moment more.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mr. Dupr\u00e9. Could you please send your other sons to help? Time we start wrapping things up here. I\u2019m so ready to come home. With my fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, ma ch\u00e8re, how often must I remind you to call me Gilles? And Eligius\u2019s brothers are already on their way. They\u2019ll be in Inverness by morn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gilles. I promise, I will bring him back safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never doubted that you will.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes to find Rhine and Seth glaring at me. I smile. \u201cI\u2019m okay, fellas. Just having a little head convo with my future father-in-law.\u201d Jake Andorra must have spoken with Eli\u2019s father. I pray I can keep my word. I incline my head to the street, where Rhine has been staring holes at me for the last few minutes. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Seth follows me down to the street, finally leaping to the ground. Rhine stares hard at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a little help coming in the morning,\u201d I offer. \u201cFor now, take us to the darkest dregs of Inverness.\u201d</p><p>A knowing gleam shines in Rhine\u2019s eyes. \u201cThis way,\u201d he offers, and turns and heads into the shadows.</p><p>With a nod, Seth and I follow Rhine and the other Ness boys into the darkness.</p><p>I\u2019m tired of all this bullshit.</p><p>I want my fianc\u00e9 back.</p><p>I want that witchpire bitch to turn to dust.</p><p>And I want to get the fuck out of here.</p><p>Part Eight</p><p> BLOODBATH</p><p>You must make your own life amongst the living and, whether you meet fair wind or foul, find your own way to harbor in the end.</p><p>\u2014Captain Daniel Gregg, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, 1947</p><p>It must be bad if Riley and Noah are sending for us. I don\u2019t like it. And Eli must be fucked-up in a serious way. That has to be driving Riley completely insane. There is no one else for Eli except Riley. They\u2019re meant to be together. Even in bloodlust, I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s not tried to get at her. And whatever or whoever is controlling my brother? Vampire, witch\u2014doesn\u2019t matter. Dead fucking meat.</p><p>\u2014S\u00e9raphin Dupr\u00e9</p><p>There really aren\u2019t dark seedy dregs in Inverness. The city is pretty clean and kept up. But because Rhine knows the underground fight circuit, as well as which clubs operate from the back room, so to say, he knows a few places to hit. The kind of place that might be harboring a vampire or two. Maybe even Carrine.</p><p>I refuse to say Eli\u2019s name with hers now. It\u2019s totally clear to me that he\u2019s being controlled by her; she has some ancient witch power that makes him do what he does. But he proved to me the night before that something in his brain still remembers me. The way he looked at me, as if trying so hard to remember. Despite his bloodred eyes\u2014totally opposite of how he typically is when he turns, which is white eyes with red pinpoint pupils. We\u2019ll fix this. Make it right. Once and for all.</p><p>One place Rhine knows in particular is tucked away near the outer city limits, in the upper floor of an older apartment building. I\u2019ve been in places just like it back home. We encountered a place very similar in Charleston, and the vampire fight club.</p><p>Sometimes you just can\u2019t keep the rotten apples out of the barrel.</p><p>Even with the Ness boys around.</p><p>By now, I\u2019ve called Noah and him and his group has joined us. I quickly tell him about my head convo with Gilles, and that Phin and Luc are on their way over now.</p><p>Noah nods. \u201cGood. I told Andorra we needed to separate Eli from the female and get him back home to Preacher.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be one hell of a plane ride back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d I answer, then glance up at the darkened apartment complex. Chunks of sandstone and brick are missing; the window is cracked on the entrance doorway. \u201cWe gotta clean this mess up first.\u201d</p><p>Noah inclines his head. \u201cLadies first.\u201d</p><p>I give him a sidelong glance. \u201cYou know, I really miss the old Noah.\u201d</p><p>He quirks an eyebrow. \u201cWhat old Noah?\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cYou know. The one who used to egg me on in a fight? Remember how proud you were in Charleston when I killed my first newling?\u201d I chuckle. \u201cRemember that nasty fight club we went into there?\u201d I mock-glare at him. \u201cYou were ringside, laughing. Cheering me on.\u201d</p><p>Noah grins. \u201cYeah. That was before the vow.\u201d</p><p>My eyes soften at him. \u201cYeah. I know.\u201d</p><p>Memories light his silvery eyes, though, and he punches my arm. \u201cThat was some crack shoot- in\u2019 in that ring, though, Poe.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s what you said then, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRi, you\u2019re not fighting tonight, are you?\u201d Seth asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot if I don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese fights move round fair quick,\u201d Rhine offers. Seth is standing beside him. \u201cRough bunch of lads, ya ken? They\u2019re in it for the money. An\u2019 you dinnae fook wi\u2019 their quid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ken,\u201d I answer. \u201cJust a quick appearance. Just to see if we can flush her out.\u201d</p><p>Her meaning Carrine.</p><p>We slip into the complex and climb the stairs. Shouts, swearing, and the acrid scent of blood, sweat, and cigarette smoke fill the air in the corridor. The moment we clear the stairwell, I see a large, bald, inked guy standing outside one of the rooms.</p><p>I look at him. Move over and let us in. Don\u2019t follow.</p><p>By the time we near him, he glances away, steps aside, and we walk directly into a large room. Dimly lit, smoke filled, and after a quick glance it looks like several rooms gutted out. Fifty humans fill the area, and it\u2019s shoulder to shoulder as we all separate and scan the arena.</p><p>So far, nothing but humans. Mean, tough-as-shit, fighting humans. But still humans. Music thumps, hard, heavy, and mixes with yells carrying through the room. Two guys fight in the center of a human ring of onlookers. Bare from the waist up, and barefoot, both of their faces already bloodied. Both of equal size, I can barely tell them apart. Both have close-shaven heads. One has a chunk of chain mail inked into his shoulder. There. That\u2019s the only difference I can make out.</p><p>That same guy lands an elbow punch to the other guy\u2019s nose and blood starts spurting. He hits the floor, writhing in pain. He doesn\u2019t get up. Cheers fly from the patrons\u2019 mouths; money is exchanged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then the lights flicker. Several glance upward, to the bare bulbs swinging overhead. One by one, the bulbs crackle and break, until the very last one lighting the room pops out. The room is cast into darkness.</p><p>Noah, get my brother out of here.</p><p>Too late. The room is filling with newbloods. I can sense them now. Ravenous. Crazed.</p> <p>I sense her. Carrine.</p><p>The screams begin.</p><p>Filled with shadows and terror, it\u2019s total chaos in the closed-in makeshift arena. I can\u2019t see. I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m getting knocked from all sides, trapped in a sea of panicking human bodies. Had she followed us here? Followed me here? What\u2019s her drive? I\u2019m lost, but one thing I know for sure. I can\u2019t let these people die. And my brother is in here. Rhine. Noah. The other Ness boys.</p><p>Souls I love and care about.</p><p>I brace myself, standing with my legs apart, stiff, and I inhale. I close my eyes, ignore the bodies slamming into me, and push all of my focus, my power, my concentration, to my center. My core. I feel it, burning as if I\u2019ve swallowed gasoline, followed by a lit match. It scorches me until I throw my hands up and release it.</p> <p>Before it leaves me, I stop it. Midair. Suspended.</p><p>Everyone is still. Frozen. I can\u2019t see faces, and I can\u2019t see who is who. But I can tell no one is moving.</p><p>I focus my words, choose them carefully. All humans, leave. Now.</p><p>Immediately, bodies start to hustle. Heartbeats have slowed down to normal, and they\u2019re all around me. Feet are shuffling out of the door.</p><p>After a few moments, I can see how many figures are left. I see Noah\u2019s dreads. Beside him, Seth and Rhine. I can plainly tell them from the other four left standing. All males.</p><p>And they\u2019re vampires.</p> <p>We\u2019re trapped in a dark building with four other vampires.</p><p>I feel my control slipping.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re weak,\u201d a female voice carries to me. \u201cPathetic and weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask Carrine in the dark. She can read my mind. She thinks she can control me. She\u2019s got another goddamn think coming.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cEli? What do I want?\u201d</p><p>My heart drops at his name on her lips.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>My eyes shift as I wait. Eli\u2019s resisting her again. He\u2019s getting stronger. My heart soars with hope.</p> <p>\u201cEli!\u201d Carrine screams. The sound vibrates within my chest. Makes the fine hairs on my neck stiffen. Witchpire. More like banshee in full-blown menopause.</p><p>\u201cHer blood, sliding down your throat,\u201d my fianc\u00e9 growls from the shadows. I hear the hesitation, the contempt in his voice. He\u2019s fighting her.</p><p>Carrine laughs. \u201cOh, my love, you know me oh so well.\u201d</p><p>Sickness pools in my stomach. None of this makes sense. My mind whirls as I struggle to hold the other vampires in the room in place. Yet my thoughts race around the fact that there\u2019s no good reason Carrine wants me, out of all the blood she can choose from. Why?</p><p>I hold my concentration, and I\u2019m straining every internal muscle I have to do it. \u201cWhy me?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cYour unique blood could empower me beyond conception,\u201d Carrine admits. \u201cI would never have to be under another\u2019s control again, like I have been for so many centuries. It\u2019s a private hell, a torture I\u2019ll no longer endure. Now bring her to me,\u201d she commands.</p><p>I see his figure weaving between the dead-still bodies of my loved ones, and the other four vampires. I know his swagger, no matter that it\u2019s bloodlust driven. Eli\u2019s fiery gaze lights on me, close. He pauses, those bloodred eyes fixated on mine.</p><p>A blinding light accompanies a sonic boom, and we\u2019re separated, all of us knocked backward. The light remains, and the bodies are stirring. Eli stands before me, confusion darkening his reddened eyes. I duck beneath him, pulling my blades, and by the time I reach Carrine I\u2019ve left three of the rogue vampires convulsing on the floor.</p><p>Carrine\u2019s eyes flash the tiniest bit of fear; then she laughs, swipes her hand out, and another boom knocks me backward. I land on my backside and skid hard. The wall stops me, stuns me for a second.</p><p>The light is still blaring when I look up. There is no sign of Carrine and Eli.</p><p>Seth takes out the rogue who lunges at him, driving a silver blade deep into its heart.</p><p>And standing in the center of the room is someone I don\u2019t expect.</p><p>It\u2019s not my light, my boom that just chased away Carrine.</p><p>My eyes blink, and I walk toward Athios.</p><p>A once-fallen angel. Now condemned to . . . something. Somewhere. I\u2019m not entirely sure what. He\u2019s nothing short of breathtaking. Tall. Elegant, yet very masculine. The white long-sleeved linen shirt pulls at his broad shoulders and grips his biceps. Thick, muscular thighs are encased by perfectly tailored dove gray slacks. Long silvery blond hair hangs straight past his shoulders, and he wears it pulled half back and secured with a silver clip. His eyes are nearly the same color as his hair, a shade darker maybe. Silvery. Not mercury, like Noah\u2019s. He\u2019s . . . beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no\u2019 much time,\u201d Athios says, and grasps my shoulders. His eyes fall on my face, and he pulls me to him in a tight embrace. I allow it. He kisses my temple and pushes me gently back. \u201cForgive me for that. I cannot help myself. And it pleases me that you think me beautiful. Not that it does me any good in the long run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, I\u2019m so glad to see you. What are you doing here?\u201d I ask him. Noah, Seth, and Rhine have joined me.</p><p>\u201cYour skills are no\u2019 honed enough,\u201d he says to me. \u201cAnd I couldna allow her to kill you, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I give a short laugh. \u201cWell, thank you for that,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to lure them,\u201d Athios says quickly. \u201cBack into the realm. There, you must kill Carrine. She is no\u2019 here naturally.\u201d</p><p>I look at him, his pure illumination making his face chiseled, beautiful in the shadows. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerian Arcos,\u201d Noah answers for him. \u201cAm I right?\u201d</p><p>Athios spares Noah a glance. \u201cYou are.\u201d He looks back at me, and his eyes soften. \u201cI couldna see it before, clearly. But I finally broke through Carrine\u2019s mind. She had a fiercely guarded charm protecting it, but I saw. Valerian has resurrected Carrine. But she\u2019s far more powerful than even Arcos suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a witch, aye? As well as a bloodsucker?\u201d Rhine asks.</p><p>Athios faces Rhine. \u201cAye, a lethal combination.\u201d</p><p>Rhine slides a glance to me.</p><p>\u201cValerian Arcos encountered Carrine centuries ago. The dark evil she delved in as a witch rivals that of the Black Fallen. Combined with her beauty, she became an obsession for Valerian.\u201d He glances at everyone, then back to me. \u201cEven back then, the magic controlled her. Nothing mattered more to her. She convinced Valerian to change her\u2014that the combined powers of a witch and a vampire would leave them invincible. Like now, she grew too greedy. Valerian entombed her. But . . .\u201d Athios strokes my chin with his knuckles. \u201cYou rise above all of that. Your blood, Riley. Your DNA. It\u2019s like a moth to light for Valerian Arcos. He felt she, of all souls, could be the one to defeat you. But Arcos didna count on Carrine\u2019s lust for power to overcome her. She\u2019s an ancient, with Pict blood and dark magic coursing through her. She hungers now for your unique and powerful blood, Riley,\u201d Athios continues. \u201cShe is overpowering Arcos. She\u2019s using her witchery to fight against him, even though he\u2019s been commanding her. She\u2019s breaking free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Eli?\u201d I ask. I grasp his hands. \u201cPlease, Athios.\u201d</p><p>His profound stare sinks straight through me. \u201cIt\u2019s because of my love for you that I cannot see you suffer,\u201d he claims. \u201cWhilst Carrine is strong, Eli is, also, extremely powerful. He\u2019s resisted killing innocents. But Carrine has fed him. Her victims. She\u2019s shared, and their blood has inevitably turned him into full bloodlust.\u201d Athios\u2019s eyes soften. \u201cValerian is forbidden to kill Eli. Which is why he\u2019s engaged Carrine into trying to force you to do the deed. You were lured here by the killing of innocents. Carrine has beckoned the rogues, and has turned a few newbloods herself. You must lure them both\u2014Carrine and Eli\u2014into the realm, and be prepared for a fight. You have to kill her in there, and \u2019twill no\u2019 be an easy task tae accomplish. She will have all of her faculties about her, Riley. But you\u2019ll also have yours as well. You\u2019re as strong as she. And you must kill her.\u201d He looks hard at me. \u201cAnd leave your love inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave Eli inside the realm?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cUntil you kill Arcos.\u201d Athios glances up. \u201cI must go. \u2019Tisna safe. For any of us.\u201d He kisses me again, briefly, and nods. \u201cUntil\u2014\u201d he says.</p><p>The light snuffs out, and we\u2019re alone once more.</p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone love you so much, Riley?\u201d Rhine asks in the shadows. \u201cHave you bewitched every male around you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I answer, and I\u2019m searching for the way out. \u201cIt\u2019s the ink.\u201d</p><p>Noah chuckles. \u201cThis way, Poe,\u201d he says.</p><p>We find our way out of the darkened complex and run the streets until dawn. Now that I know Carrine, originally controlled by Valerian Arcos, has been pulling away from his control. Causing the disturbances in the city without his command.</p><p>And Eli is trapped in the middle.</p><p>All because of some insane obsession Valerian Arcos has with me? Rather, my blood. That\u2019s the trigger. Not me, Riley, the person. Arcos doesn\u2019t know me. He doesn\u2019t know that I love The Goonies, can quote most of Young Guns, and like to bake. He doesn\u2019t know me at all. It\u2019s all warped and twisted around my dumb-ass blood. He\u2019s always wanted it, even while entombed in Savannah, before he and Vic were set free. And now that my DNA has Strigoi and Black Fallen traits, he\u2019s insane with wanting it. He\u2019ll never get it.</p><p>Some of the other Ness boys had called it quits earlier. Jobs. Real life. I\u2019m pretty impressed they\u2019re all juggling it so well. So organized, for such a young group of humans. Males at that. The rest of us, Rhine included, encountered a few stray rogues Carrine had set upon us earlier. Two more innocents had died while we fucked around in that complex. We ran until we flushed them out. One male, one female. Rhine shocks me with his speed and accuracy with the silver. The Inverness police were already busy at the scenes, and by the time they find the vampiric remains, they see it as nothing more than little piles of ash. It\u2019s all over the news, and even in the caf\u00e9 we stop in to grab coffee, it\u2019s the talk of the shop. Serial killer running amok in Inverness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>People are scared. I can smell their fear.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired, Ri,\u201d my brother says as we walk up the sidewalk. He drapes an arm over my shoulder. The people of Inverness are hustling about, going to work, school, getting on with their lives.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m feeling it,\u201d I answer, and meet Seth\u2019s worried gaze. \u201cHow you holding up, bro?\u201d</p> <p>Seth ducks his head. \u201cHoldin\u2019. Riggs told me to tell you he misses you,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cZetty, too. And of course Preacher and Estelle, and Nyx.\u201d He scratches his head. \u201cAnd all of the Dupr\u00e9s, I guess.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cPretty much everyone.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I lay my head on my brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI miss them all, too.\u201d Sliding an arm around his waist, I squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you most, though.\u201d</p><p>Seth kisses the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too, sis. All this will be over soon. It\u2019ll be right again. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh, you two are just so darn sweet,\u201d Noah says from behind us.</p><p>Rhine chuckles.</p> <p>Suddenly, the hair on the back of my neck bristles. My gaze lifts, away from the sidewalk I\u2019m walking on, and it cuts across the street.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>But everything inside me screams Eli. He\u2019s watching me, curious.</p><p>Back at the Crachan, I shower, change, and in thirty minutes meet the others downstairs. I\u2019m starting to wind down, feel weary, but I want to go with Seth, Noah, and Rhine to pick up Eli\u2019s brothers at the airport. I\u2019ve missed them. And, I confess, there\u2019s some comfort in having Luc and Phin close. Almost like having a piece of Eli with me.</p><p>We take two Rovers, and I ride with Rhine. Although the sun is hidden, the gray-white of daylight is bright. He wears a dark pair of shades as he weaves through the streets to Inverness\u2019s airport. Noah and Seth follow behind us in the other Rover.</p><p>\u201cI can go wi\u2019 you, ya know,\u201d Rhine says. \u201cInside the realm.\u201d His gaze is straight ahead, on the road, but I can tell by the clenching of his jaw that he\u2019s worried.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou\u2019re strong, and fast as hell with the silver.\u201d I cover his hand with mine. \u201cBut no way could you keep up in there. I\u2019d constantly be worried about what you were doing instead of concentrating on what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>An amused grin lifts one side of his mouth. \u201cYou worry about me, Poe?\u201d</p><p>I punch his arm. \u201cHell yeah, I worry.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t see his eyes behind the shades, but his mouth gives it all away. He full-out grins. \u201cThat makes me sor\u2019 o\u2019 feel like a baby. Havin\u2019 a lass worry o\u2019er me so much.\u201d</p><p>Rhine\u2019s accent is heavy, and at times I have to concentrate on what he\u2019s saying to get the meaning. \u201cGet used to it,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do. Ask anyone who knows me.\u201d</p><p>Rhine hits the volume to the radio, and a tune filters through the speakers of the Rover. His gravelly, unique voice overtakes the artist\u2019s, and he claims the song. I listen, amazed, and when he pulls into a parking spot and shoves the Rover into park, I smile at him. \u201cI think I could listen to you sing for hours,\u201d I admit. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to send me some music when I leave.\u201d</p><p>Rhine takes off his shades, and green eyes study me. \u201cI\u2019m gonna hate tae see you go.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou probably say that to all your band groupies.\u201d</p> <p>Opening the door, he steps out. \u201cOnly tae you.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Seth join us, and together the four of us hurry into the small airport to await Phin and Luc\u2019s flight. It\u2019s on time, thankfully, and just hit the tarmac. I stand, staring out of the huge Plexiglas overlooking the runway, and watch other planes land and take off. Memories assault me, and I can\u2019t help tracing time back to the day I first met the Dupr\u00e9 family. The first time I understood that vampires existed. Luc and Phin were both so eager to show off their skills. I remember how they leaped like frogs on crack across Gilles\u2019s parlor. Scared the holy shit out of me back then. Cracks me up to think about it now. Seems like I\u2019ve known them all for years. Eli? Forever.</p><p>\u201cHey, come on outta there,\u201d Noah says by my side. \u201cBefore you start bawling all over the airport.\u201d He drops his arm over my shoulders and gives me a shake. \u201cLook at Luc and Phin. They\u2019re tripping over each other to get to you first.\u201d</p><p>My memory of Eli and our first official introduction simmers inside me as I focus on the present, and Eli\u2019s two younger brothers pushing past each other and the passengers filing out. Each has a duffel swung over his shoulder. Phin\u2019s dark blond buzz cut and black shades stand in contrast with his perfect pale skin. Luc, whose hair is longer, brushing the collar of his black leather jacket, has a wide white smile. Both are making a beeline straight to me. When they reach me, they drop their duffels in unison. Phin reaches me first, throws his arms around my waist, and picks me off the floor. I fall into his embrace and squeeze.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Poe,\u201d he mutters against my neck. \u201cI\u2019ve missed the holy hell outta you!\u201d</p><p>A wash of emotion hits me, and I breathe in his familiar scent. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>In the next instant, I\u2019m pulled directly out of Phin\u2019s arms and am now enveloped into Luc\u2019s strong embrace. \u201cSis,\u201d he says against my hair. He\u2019s a little quieter than the rowdy Phin, and his French accent is a little stronger. Every feeling he has rushes through me, too. He pulls back and kisses me on the cheek. The trademark Dupr\u00e9 cerulean blue eyes stare down at me, so much like Eli\u2019s it almost hurts to see them. \u201cIt\u2019s not been the same without you guys around.\u201d</p><p>Phin laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s been flat-out boring as hell at home without you.\u201d</p><p>Luc kisses my cheek once more. \u201cThat is for Gilles and Elise. They miss you terribly.\u201d</p><p>I stare into his gaze. \u201cWe\u2019ll all be home soon.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Seth exchange manly bro shakes and side hugs with Eli\u2019s brothers, and then introductions are made between the Dupr\u00e9s and Rhine, and we make our way through the semicrowd of people filing out of baggage claim.</p><p>As we leave the building, I\u2019m sandwiched between Eli\u2019s brothers, each with an arm draped over my shoulders. We cross the parking lot, and at the Rovers, Phin doesn\u2019t let me go. He inclines his head to the backseat, and we climb in. Luc shoots him a glare and then jumps in the front with Rhine. We head back to the Crachan, and by the time we arrive, I\u2019ve updated Luc and Phin on all the events to date in Inverness. They are not surprised when I tell them Valerian Arcos is behind it all, and that he resurrected Carrine to control Eli, making me believe my only choice was to kill him. Fury makes their eyes turn dark, and I know that if Valerian makes the mistake of showing back up, he won\u2019t survive.</p><p>And that, of course, will start an epic war between the vampire families.</p><p>They needed to stand in line, though. I\u2019ve already had fanciful visions of shoving silver into Valerian\u2019s heart myself.</p><p>Luc and Phin are completely impressed with Rhine and the Ness boys\u2019 work in the city, and by the time Rhine pulls into the drive, they\u2019re pretty much up to speed.</p><p>Noah and Seth join us, and we all walk in. Pete is squating down in front of the hearth, stoking a roaring fire. Two other Ness boys are plopped onto chairs, eating bowls of cereal. I\u2019m pretty sure, by the furtive glances Pete and the others pass Luc and Phin when they\u2019re introduced, they\u2019re freaked out by their houseful of vampires.</p><p>We sit on the sofa, Luc and Phin on either side of me. Noah and Seth fall into chairs. Rhine throws himself down in front of the hearth, onto the floor.</p><p>We discuss our next move.</p><p>\u201cIf Carrine is everything you say she is,\u201d Phin says, rubbing his buzz-cut head, \u201cshe\u2019ll know when you try to get to St. Bueno\u2019s to fill those cartridges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why me and a few of the other lads should go alone,\u201d Rhine offers. \u201cShe\u2019ll focus on you, Riley.\u201d He inclines his head to Luc and Phin. \u201cAnd on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Noah agrees. He looks at Rhine. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do this now.\u201d He inclines his head to me. \u201cThe longer she waits, the stronger Carrine becomes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to go in alone, Ri?\u201d Seth asks. His green eyes are hazy with worry. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I answer my baby brother, \u201cour theory is, since Carrine was a powerful witch before she became a vampire, she can manipulate inside the realm. I saw a piece of it before.\u201d I smile at him wryly. \u201cWhat if she, I don\u2019t know\u201d\u2014I incline my head to Luc\u2014\u201cmanipulated him to act against me?\u201d I shake my head, the thought making me sick inside. \u201cI couldn\u2019t face having to fight one of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I for one am dying to see this scatha of yours,\u201d Phin says. He looks at Rhine. \u201cWhen will you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sooner the better,\u201d Rhine says in his brogue. He glances at me. \u201cAn\u2019 from the looks o\u2019 it, lads, Riley here is about tae crash.\u201d</p><p>I focus on the handsome young Scotsman, and realize my vision has in fact gone blurry.</p><p>\u201cYeah, look at that goofy look on her face,\u201d Phin says, leaning back and staring at me. He lifts his hand in front of me. \u201cHow many fingers am I holding up?\u201d</p><p>I stare. \u201cOne. And your mother would beat you if she saw that,\u201d I say.</p><p>I am feeling weary, though. \u201cI\u2019d feel better if Seth went with Rhine and the others,\u201d I mumble, and lay my head over onto Luc\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMake sure at least . . . eight of you go, huh?\u201d I try to focus on Rhine, but his face has become distorted. My eyelids grow heavier and heavier.</p><p>\u201cOch, there she goes,\u201d Rhine says, his voice fainter now. His voice sounds like he\u2019s talking from a concrete tunnel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her up,\u201d Noah says, his voice even fainter. \u201cYou boys will find some V8 in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>I feel my body go weightless as Noah leans down and slides his arms under my knees and shoulders, lifting me into the air. The room is spinning as he\u2019s taking me upstairs, and I concentrate on his features to keep from becoming dizzy. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be a way to fix this narcolepsy,\u201d I mumble. \u201cDon\u2019t like it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head rests against Noah\u2019s chest, and his deep rumble vibrates against my ear as he chuckles. \u201cNone of us like it, Ri. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d He stares down at me. \u201cWe\u2019ll get Preach to figure something out once we get home.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re moving down the corridor now, and I feel like I\u2019m floating, Noah\u2019s movements are so fluid and graceful.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d he says, grinning. His white teeth flash in the shadowy hallway as he makes his way to my room.</p> <p>\u201cKey\u2019s in my pocket,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>The slight pressure of his fingers slipping into my back pocket keeps me focused. He unlocks my door, and we ease inside. When he lowers me to my bed, he pulls off my boots, unfastens my leather holster, and pushes the straps over my shoulders and sets it aside. His hands search for blades, find them, and set them on the bedside table. Silver free, he pushes me back and pulls the woolen plaid blanket up to my chin. He tucks me in.</p><p>Through my fading consciousness, I grin and ease my hand out from beneath the wool. I graze his cheek. \u201cThanks, Noah. What would I do without you?\u201d</p><p>The room is gray and shadowy, but I can still see his face. With his hands, he grasps both sides of my face, lowers his mouth to mine, and kisses me gently. I\u2019m conscious enough to know it\u2019s not a sexual gesture\u2014surprising, since it\u2019s coming from Noah. When he lifts his head, the mercury silver of his eyes soften. \u201cYou won\u2019t ever have to find out, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head into my pillow and the weightiness of sleep lulls me in. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell Eli you kissed me like that,\u201d I manage to mutter. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna kick your ass.\u201d</p> <p>Noah\u2019s soft chuckle is the last thing I hear. \u201cHe\u2019ll understand completely.\u201d</p><p>Then I\u2019m swallowed up in shadows. In my sleep, unavoidable memories assault me as I lie here helpless. Memories of Eli. The first time he touched me. The first time I had him inside me . . . and the first time he told me he loved me.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flutter open, and I\u2019m no longer in my bedroom at the Crachan. I\u2019m . . . nowhere. In darkness. Suspended in weightless pitch. But the voice I know. I should be fearful, but I\u2019m not. It\u2019s Eli.</p><p>\u201cI saw you through my storefront window, back home,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cSavannah. You\u2019re one of the city\u2019s guardians, Eli. You and your brothers, Luc and Phin. Your little sister, Josie. And your parents. Gilles and Elise.\u201d I sigh, and it hurts my chest.</p><p>\u201cGuardians for what?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cAgainst rogue vampires. You keep the humans safe, Eli.\u201d</p><p>At first, he\u2019s silent. Several moments pass. \u201cI want to know more about . . . you.\u201d</p><p>I blink back tears, but I\u2019m in sheer darkness and can\u2019t even tell if they fall onto a surface. I\u2019m suspended, like floating on a cloud. \u201cI\u2019m your fianc\u00e9e, Eli. We\u2019ve . . . been through a lot together. You\u2019ve saved my life more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about . . . us?\u201d Eli inquires. I can tell he\u2019s treading on treacherous ground. He\u2019s curious. Not trusting. Unsure of himself. Of me.</p><p>\u201cCan you touch me in here?\u201d I ask. \u201cIn this place?\u201d</p><p>He pauses. \u201cOui.\u201d</p> <p>My insides are shaking like crazy. \u201cCome here, then.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t see him; don\u2019t see him move. But I feel a shift in atmosphere, and in the next instant, Eli\u2019s here, in front of me. \u201cBe still,\u201d I command. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot . . . safe,\u201d he mutters. I can tell he\u2019s losing control.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me,\u201d I say. I\u2019m not completely sure of that, but I can\u2019t help trying this. I lift both my hands, and my palms grasp his firm, stubbled jaw. Energy radiates from him, and fear rolls off him in waves. I pull his head down, closer to mine. Gently, I press my lips to his.</p><p>The moment of contact feels like lightning. The current that surges through me, through Eli, is palpable. Energy pings through every nerve ending, shooting down my legs, out of my arms, and harboring in my core. I gasp, and he does, too. I kiss him gently, and in that kiss, I show Eli every raw emotion I possess. All for him. At first, he holds dead still. He\u2019s so still I wonder if he\u2019s ready to sink his fangs into my flesh. To kill me. To lose his will to fight.</p><p>Then, hesitantly, he kisses me back.</p><p>Although I can\u2019t see him, he\u2019s everywhere. His lips move almost shyly against mine, as though it\u2019s a teenage boy\u2019s first kiss. Endearing. Heartfelt. And I drink him in.</p><p>I press my body toward his, seeking comfort. The comfort of Eli.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her, Eli,\u201d Carrine\u2019s voice interrupts.</p><p>Eli goes still, but his lips remain against mine.</p><p>A surge of power fills the weightless space we\u2019re suspended in, and her bansheelike scream fills my body.</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d</p><p>Fear and instinct make me force the energy building from my core out of my limbs, and now I\u2019m hurling through the darkness, so fast I\u2019m dizzy. . . .</p><p>\u201cCalme, l\u2019un a peint enbas,\u201d a voice says gently. A hand grips my shoulder. \u201cRiley, wake up.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flutter open. Phin is staring down at me, the lamplight spilling over his chiseled features as he studies me. I smile. \u201cPainted One. I haven\u2019t heard that one in a while.\u201d He\u2019d said quiet down, Painted One. Something Eli had said to me. It\u2019s what the Gullah and the Guardians all call me. Painted One. Because of my ink. That seems like such a long, long time ago.</p><p>\u201cYou were . . . dreaming,\u201d Phin says with a half-cocked grin. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it was of my brother\u2014ow!\u201d Phin rubs his forehead where I\u2019ve just thumped him.</p><p>Although I\u2019m joking at first, my humor fades and is quickly replaced by an almost . . . panic. Pain. Dread. \u201cPhin, I miss him.\u201d My eyes sting from tears. \u201cI have to get him back. Just then, he was trying to remember me. Us. Our life before all of this.\u201d</p><p>Phin traces the inked wing at the corner of my eye. \u201cHe will, sis.\u201d His mouth tilts in a grin. \u201cMy brother\u2019s will is stronger than you think. And his love for you is a powerful thing. I gotta say, though. He\u2019s one lucky bastard.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and push the tears from my cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s borderline perverted of you to pitch a tent in my dreams about your brother. My fianc\u00e9, don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>Phin shudders. \u201cI didn\u2019t stay long.\u201d He eyes me. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were okay. At first, you were calm. Then you started to freak out. So I woke you. You\u2019ve not been sleeping that long. Less than fourteen hours.\u201d He pushes my hair back, picks up a fuchsia strand, rubs it between his fingers. \u201cThink you can make it, ch\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>I push up on my elbows and stretch. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m ready to get on with it. Did Rhine and Seth and the guys get the cartridges filled?\u201d</p><p>Phin nods. \u201cOui.\u201d He reaches down and pulls up the scatha, and grins. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait. This thing is sick.\u201d</p><p>Luc pokes his head in the door. \u201cYou woke her?\u201d he asks, eyeing his sibling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I did,\u201d Phin says, grinning at Luc\u2019s puzzled expression. I slap his arm. He holds the scatha up to his brother. \u201cCheck it out.\u201d</p><p>The bed sags as the other Dupr\u00e9 brother sits down. He grasps the weapon and turns it over, thoroughly inspecting it. I tell them of Edinburgh, and how two ancient knights\u2014one a once-Earthbound angel to boot\u2014taught the WUP team how to properly use a broadsword. Both were now completely mortal, but badass to the bone and a wealth of knowledge. \u201cGawan told us where to find the mystical sacred water to fill the cartridges.\u201d I reach over to the medieval-designed crossbow and show them where the cartridges load. They both watch on in interest. Phin\u2019s buzz cut and Luc\u2019s fashionably longer-haired heads both bent over the scatha. \u201cAnd he instructed me to seek out the alternative realm there. I want this to be over. I . . . need Eli back.\u201d</p><p>Both of Eli\u2019s brothers look up, understanding and love making their eyes glassy. Luc grabs my shoulder and squeezes. \u201cI know, sis. We\u2019ll get him.\u201d</p><p>I lean my head against Phin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy sometimes to just want to . . . walk away. Be normal.\u201d I incline my head toward the window. \u201cLike them. Everyday people, going about their daily lives without a clue. Ignorant.\u201d I inhale Phin\u2019s unique scent. His vampiric scent. Reminds me of a cedar fire. \u201cI want to be ignorant sometimes. But that\u2019s so damn selfish. I hate even thinking it.\u201d</p><p>Luc ducks his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll get him, ma ch\u00e8re,\u201d he says. \u201cI vow it.\u201d</p><p>Then, at once, I stiffen. Luc and Phin feel it, too, because both of their backs go straight, and Luc stands and walks to the window.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s not right,\u201d I say, and I kick out of the covers and stand. A draft catches the skin on my legs, and I glance down, not remembering Noah taking off my pants. I spy them at the foot of the bed, and I hastily shove my legs into them. Grabbing my boots, I sit on the bed and yank them on, too. I\u2019m crossing the room now, and I find my silver holster and shrug into it, stuffing blades in all their proper places. When I\u2019m finished, I leave the leather halter I\u2019m wearing in place, forgo the jacket, and hurry to the window. Next to Luc I stand, peering out. Shadows shift, stretch.</p><p>Movement. Above us, below us.</p><p>A sinking feeling crashes over me. Familiar. Terrifying.</p><p>\u201cThis place is surrounded,\u201d Phin says, peering over my head. \u201cFucking bloodsuckers.\u201d</p><p>It barely registers in my head that my soon-to-be brother-in-law, who is a vampire, is calling other vampires bloodsuckers. The Gullah would be so proud.</p><p>\u201cLuc, take the stairs. Tell Noah and the others what\u2019s going down,\u201d I say, pushing up the window as easy as I can. \u201cPhin?\u201d I stick my leg out, straddling the sill, and make eye contact with Luc. \u201cWatch Rhine and my brother,\u201d I ask. \u201cPlease.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know I will,\u201d Luc says, and he disappears from my room. I give Phin a silent nod, and he\u2019s blurring with rage. Pulling my legs up, I grasp the ledge and push hard. My body flips upward and I land on the roof. Crouching, I search the darkness. Phin lands beside me, and together we move over the top of the Crachan, keeping low.</p><p>I see them.</p><p>It\u2019s almost too many to believe.</p> <p>It\u2019ll be a goddamn bloodbath.</p><p>Just then they swarm. From the wood, the surrounding trees, the street. And at the same time, Noah, Luc, Seth, Rhine, and the Ness boys fill the Crachan\u2019s courtyard.</p><p>Like a medieval war, both sides charge.</p><p>Without waiting for Phin, I leap down, draw a blade, and jump in. Just as I land, I\u2019m grabbed, and as curses and screams fill the air, I\u2019m forcefully dragged into the shadows.</p><p>Part Nine</p> <p> CHAOS</p><p>We\u2019re gonna need a bigger boat.</p><p>\u2014Sheriff Martin Brody, Jaws, 1975</p><p>Of course I fucking love her. What kind of a dumb-ass question is that?</p><p>\u2014Noah Miles, when asked if he loves Riley Poe</p><p>A strong, rock-hard biceps is wrapped around my throat, dragging me back into the shadows behind the Crachan. His familiar scent, burned deep into my memory and sensory, hits me in waves. So much that, for a second, I\u2019m powerless to defend myself. Powerless to escape. It\u2019s tempting to just let him drag me off and do . . . whatever.</p> <p>At least it\u2019s him. Eligius. And for a split second, we\u2019re together.</p><p>Eli goes stone-dead still, turns, and looks down at me. He hesitates. In the half shadows, I see his face. Conflict and confusion war in the depths of his red eyes.</p><p>I stretch my hand out to graze his jaw. \u201cEli\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh no, you don\u2019t, Riley. Fight. Get away from him. He\u2019s not your love right now. He\u2019s your enemy. Run. Now. Or all chances of saving him are gone.</p><p>Athios\u2019s words hit me in the gut; it doesn\u2019t take much. I\u2019m not suicidal, or so awash with grief that I don\u2019t want to survive in this chaotic world I live in without Eli. The faces of Seth, my Gullah family, the Dupr\u00e9s, Noah, Rhine\u2014they all flash before me.</p><p>I focus, forcing all of my energy to my core, and when it gathers, builds, and then explodes, Eli is thrown back. I don\u2019t turn around, and I don\u2019t stop to wonder where he was thrown to. I run. Haul ass, straight for the back entrance of the Crachan.</p><p>I\u2019ve got to get the scatha.</p><p>Carrine\u2019s voice catches my ear. \u201cGo after her, imbecile!\u201d</p> <p>I know what I\u2019ve got to do.</p><p>When I reach the door, it\u2019s partially open and I hurry inside. The lights are out, and darkness and shadows stretch and distort my surroundings in a building I\u2019m already not overly familiar with. I\u2019m in the kitchen, and the sounds of the fight outside waft in from several broken windows. I push the thoughts and visions aside and make my way to the staircase.</p><p>I\u2019m not alone.</p><p>Eli\u2019s right behind me. There\u2019s no use in hiding from him. I know he can sense me, smell me, just like I can him. On my way through the hall, I grab an iron poker from the hearth, leap over the sofa, and dash for the stairs. Just as I reach them, my arm is grabbed.</p><p>Eli has a tight grip on my wrist.</p><p>Without hesitation, I swing the iron poker and clobber him. His head snaps to the side, and his grip loosens just enough for me to break free. I run. Through the darkness, I take comfort in knowing that, no matter how hideous it sounded and looked, that iron poker didn\u2019t do anything to my fianc\u00e9 except stun him for a second.</p><p>It\u2019s not like I poked him with silver.</p><p>I\u2019m running up the corridor to my room when I\u2019m slammed into and I hit the wall. A newling. Female. Face distorted, ragged teeth dropped and snapping at me.</p><p>I drop the iron poker, yank a blade from a sheath, and ram it into her heart. As she falls, I leap over her and into my room. Grab my scatha off the bed where Luc left it, and just as I\u2019m slipping the newly packed duffel filled with cartridges over my head, Eli grabs me and yanks me around. His grip is tight. And I\u2019ve dropped my nonsilver weapon.</p><p>He starts to drag me now, back toward the door. Eli\u2019s eyes are bloodred, his expression blank. He\u2019s wearing a black T-shirt, and his biceps bulge as he yanks me hard. My heart plummets; confusion webs my brain, and part of me wants to scream, wrap my arms around his neck, and kiss him, or hit him, until he wakes the fuck up! Recognizes me!</p><p>\u201cEli! Please!\u201d I holler.</p><p>For a split second, he hesitates. His grip is still tight, but he stops. Studies me. And confusion flashes in his eyes.</p><p>I don\u2019t waste time. Instead, I focus my energy. It\u2019s happening faster now. I\u2019m gaining more control over my Fallen powers. In the next second, Eli is tossed across the room. I\u2019m stunned at the force and exactness of my powers, but I don\u2019t hang around. I head straight for the window and leap out.</p><p>At the bottom, I land, crouched, and in the middle of . . . chaos. There\u2019s fighting all around me, Ness boys fighting vampires. Blood. Piles of quivering dead newlings. I catch sight of Noah, and Seth and Rhine are close by.</p><p>He turns and sees me, then glances up.</p><p>Eli lands behind me, and I take off. I head straight for Rhine, and he doesn\u2019t even look at me as he reaches into his pocket and throws me the key to his bike. I catch it and keep running, and I jump the last few feet and land, straddling his bike, jam the key in, and hit the engine. Just as Eli nears, I peel out down the drive. No time for a helmet. Eli\u2019s on foot, right behind me. So close I can hear his grunts in my ear.</p><p>I run over two vamp bodies, and hit another one as he surges toward me; then I skid out into the street and take off. Vehicles are sparse, but still on the road, along with trash cans and plastic recycle bins as I nudge my way through and make it to the bridge. I glance over my shoulder; Eli no longer follows on foot.</p><p>But I know he and Carrine will follow me.</p><p>It\u2019s me she wants.</p><p>And I fucking want her.</p><p>I hit the A-9 and let the throttle out. I\u2019m heading for Dingwall, Ivy Cottage, and the standing stones. I\u2019m going into the realm.</p><p>And I know Carrine and Eli will follow me.</p><p>I squint against the frigid Highland wind pelting into my eyes. In my rearview mirror, I see a single headlight. It\u2019s growing closer. Faster. I look straight ahead and pray Rhine\u2019s bike can outrun the one behind me.</p><p>The one carrying Eli and Carrine.</p><p>As I fly through Strathpeffer, then Dingwall, I\u2019m pushing the bike to its limit. It\u2019s pretty fast, and I\u2019m relieved I don\u2019t have to take the time to convince a local cop not to chase me down. Luckily, the cars are few and far between, and by the time I\u2019m heading out of Dingwall and up the steep incline next to the car dealership, there are no cars at all. Ducking my head against the wind, I fly toward Ivy Cottage. At the drive\u2019s entrance, I hit the brakes and skid sideways, coming to a stop. Kickstand down, I grab the key, stuff it in my pocket, and take off up the drive on foot. There\u2019s a light in the living room of the crofter\u2019s house, and I\u2019m hoping he didn\u2019t hear or see Rhine\u2019s bike. It\u2019s dark, and clouds obscure most of the moonlight. But I know where I\u2019m going, and I rush past Ivy Cottage at the top of the hill, jump the sheep\u2019s fence by the barn, and tear up the path toward the stones. In the distance behind me, I hear the roar of another motorcycle.</p><p>I\u2019m running top speed through dead gorse and heather, the big prickly clumps catching my boots so much that I have to take large leaps to get over them without falling. Higher I climb, and before long, the moon slides out of the clouds, and the silhouettes of the stones rise before me. I stop, looking around me as I reach into my duffel, grab a handful of cartridges, and quickly load the scatha. I snap the lever in place and, without a glance backward, step into the stones.</p><p>The air shifts around me; a mist gathers and swirls up, crawling higher and winding around my legs and my torso and obscuring my vision. Then it begins to thin out, before me. Here, time is lost, from the world I just left, and this one. It\u2019s unpredictable, and I might as well not hurry. I\u2019ll fuck up if I hurry, and this is not the time for a fuckup. What I want is coming. Eventually. And I have patience this time. My head is clear. My will is stronger than it has ever been. And I have control.</p><p>I\u2019m facing a slight incline: a hill, with a path walked smooth. I follow it, and notice a black iron gate ahead. As I walk, my fingers tighten around the scatha; my pack is slung over one shoulder. My arms are bare in my leather halter top, and yet the cold doesn\u2019t bother me at all. Walking through the gate, I descend stone steps embedded into the cliffside, and at the bottom, a long, barren street. Abandoned cars line the curb on either side, tires flat, windows broken out, doors and trunks open. At the end of the street, another pair of tall black gates. A cemetery. I\u2019m walking down the center of the street, unwilling to get too close to the buildings on either side. Some have doors; others have black, cavernous mouths. No way am I getting close enough to those, so I stay walking straight down the middle of the street. My gaze roves back and forth, up and down, searching. The building has no glass in the windows. No drapes. No lights. The lone click-clack of my black leather heeled boots against the paved street makes echoes in the silence, the solitude.</p><p>Only then do I see eyes staring at me from the shadowy windows and doorways.</p><p>Dozens and dozens of them. Red. Unblinking.</p><p>Then music. I hear it, coming from some back room in the building beside me. I glance over, the top-floor window glassless and dark, and the music grows louder. Billy Idol. \u201cWhite Wedding.\u201d</p><p>Then the eyes disappear, and a rustling, scratching noise begins, growing louder and louder, and then out of the doors and windows pours dozens and dozens\u2014maybe hundreds\u2014of cats. They crawl atop the abandoned cars and line the streets, and their eyes follow me as I walk, as Billy\u2019s voice carries out through the upper window.</p><p>Cats? Am I really going to have to blast cats?</p><p>They don\u2019t set one paw in the street; they stick to the curb. And as I slowly pass them by, they crack open their mouths and smile, their little cat lips pulling back over complete, perfect sets of human teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019re not moving toward me, not rushing me. Not attacking me. So I continue on my way to the large iron cemetery arch at the end of the street.</p><p>Then one solitary cat yawns, and its mouth widens to a disproportionate size: a big black jagged, gaping hole that takes up most of its head.</p><p>And it screams.</p> <p>At once, they all stand on their hind legs, straight up, and join in the screaming. They look like some discombobulated Meerkat Manor of the alternative world, and the minute they launch at me, I take off. I run, hesitating to use my cartridges on a bunch of fucking big-mouthed cats.</p><p>The first one latches on to my hip, and those human teeth drop long and sharp and sink into my flesh. With my free hand I grab it by the scruff and fling it off, but it\u2019s soon replaced by another, and another, and now they\u2019re all lunging at me from their curbside perches. It\u2019s the first time Billy Idol has ever, ever annoyed me.</p><p>I now have hundreds of vampire cats flying through the air and attacking me.</p><p>I focus, zero in on them, envision in my head a room filled with cats, and I release my energy. The shock wave rocks them all back, sends them flying against the buildings. I run top speed to the iron gates in front of me. Glancing over my shoulder, I see the cats are dazed, but shaking their heads and watching me. Then they run after me. I hurry.</p><p>The moment my feet cross the cemetery\u2019s threshold, the cats disappear. I breathe a quick sigh of relief that A: I didn\u2019t have to blow a cat away. And B: I still have all of my cartridges.</p> <p>As I glance around, the cemetery shifts, and tall Celtic crosses bend unnaturally to the side and back, and the marble statues, blackened with age, begin to move, walk, drag themselves toward me like stone zombies. Cemetery. Bad choice, Poe.</p><p>Only choice. Consecrated ground. Sanctuary. Better than out in the open, with rabid vamp cats throwing themselves at my throat. I hurry.</p><p>Just as I think, Where the hell is Carrine? she appears. Slipping from behind a leaning crypt, she emerges. She\u2019s wearing clothes similar\u2014no, almost identical\u2014to mine. Tall black boots, leather low-riders, leather halter. Her hair is down, and her eyes are bloodred. Behind her, Eli stands still, watching me. Silent. Silent, but seething in bloodlust. Bloodlust and . . . confusion. He\u2019s fighting her. I can tell it, sense it, feel it. I can feel it where I stand. But will he be able to withstand the brunt of her power if she enforces it? Jesus, I don\u2019t want to kill my beloved.</p><p>\u201cAre you wondering if we just followed you here for the hell of it?\u201d Carrine says to me. She smiles and lifts her hand, pulls Eli\u2019s mouth to hers, and traces his lips with her tongue. She looks at me, slightly shaking her head. \u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t speak. I just watch. I know now that Eli is heavily under her spell. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. And that eases the pain somewhat. My forefinger flips the lever on the scatha, and my palm tightens the grip. I wait. I can\u2019t hit Eli with my aim.</p><p>Carrine laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ll hit nothing with that toy, silly girl.\u201d With a swipe of her hand, she sends my scatha flying. The force of her power knocks me back several feet, and I slide against the gravel and rock, slamming into a gravestone. I shake my head, dazed, but I stand. Carrine slowly walks toward me, taking long, exaggerated runway model steps.</p> <p>I jump up, face her. She looks at me, first at the ink at my cheek, then at my dragon tails down my arm. Her gaze lifts to mine. \u201cPity to waste such a . . . unique shell,\u201d she says. \u201cBut your blood is much more important. It\u2019s something I must have, you see. To add to mine.\u201d The smile that stretches over her face chills me. \u201cYou canna conceive the power your blood and mine combined will produce. It\u2019s almost . . . erotic, the thought of it\u2014\u201d</p><p>I swing with my fist and catch her jaw. Her head rocks to the side, and she snaps her gaze back to mine. She smiles, but her face is contorted with hate.</p><p>In the next breath, she morphs, and she\u2019s ugly as holy fucking hell. Her face shakes and blurs, then elongates; jaws unhinge, and her teeth drop from her bleeding gums in long jagged shanks. Her mouth resembles the cats\u2019: disproportionate and taking up a lot of her face space.</p><p>With as much energy as I can focus, I turn and roundhouse kick her in the mouth. Carrine spins, and when she is righted, her foot is airborne and catches me in the shoulder. I stumble, and she\u2019s lunging toward me, teeth snapping together, coming an inch from my throat. I fall against a crypt and slam her body against it, once, twice. She lets go, and I turn and dive for my scatha. My fingers touch it, but Carrine grabs my ankles and she flings me away from it. I roll, and she hits the ground I just vacated. Leaping up, she faces me. We\u2019re both crouched, eyes trained on each other. Slowly, we circle.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t survive me, Riley Poe. I thought I\u2019d never escape that hell Valerian entombed me in.\u201d She laughs, but her gaze is locked solid on to mine. \u201cMuch to my surprise, he set me free. Thought his power over me was enough to make me obey his commands.\u201d She laughs again. \u201cWhat a foolish, selfish little prick he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know? We finally agree on something,\u201d I say.</p><p>I stare at Carrine, her lips pulled back into some weird catlike gaping-hole-of-a-mouth specter as an unfamiliar language pours from her lips. A curse? Black magic? I don\u2019t know, and I honestly don\u2019t give a damn. Forcing all of my energy to the center of my body, I draw a deep breath, pulling the energy from my core to my fingertips. I . . . throw it at her.</p><p>And her arms rise, too, and her energy is thrown right the hell back at me.</p> <p>Together we stand, our energy forces colliding in an electric punch, and I can feel her severe witchpireness. It\u2019s strong. Tough as shit.</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t have a fianc\u00e9. A life. A family.</p><p>Somewhere deep inside me, it all collides together, and like a tornado it rips from my body. Carrine is flung back, far, and her body crashes against a contorted Celtic cross.</p><p>I dive toward the scathe, palm it, and roll to my back. Carrine is in the air, almost upon me.</p><p>I fire. Direct hit, right in the heart.</p><p>Carrine\u2019s scream pierces the air as her body bursts into shards, and by the time the pieces hit the cemetery ground, they\u2019ve turned to dust. It\u2019s like a volcanic ash fallout.</p><p>My body is thrown to the ground, and my head hits hard. Stunned and shaken, I take a second or two to realize Eli has moved. He stares down at me now, has me trapped.</p><p>For some reason, I\u2019m only worried about Carrine. Not once does it occur to me that Eli would be a danger, regardless of whether he knows what he\u2019s doing.</p><p>I know it now.</p><p>I\u2019ve misjudged him.</p><p>Eligius Dupr\u00e9, my love, my fianc\u00e9, may not be under Carrine\u2019s control any longer, but he\u2019s in full-blown bloodlust, and he hovers over me now, fully morphed, his face contorted and disjointed. His red gaze focuses on the pulse at my throat. I dive left, and his hand encircles my ankle and yanks me down, my head slamming into the ground. I feel his hand go around my throat, squeezing, lifting me off the ground. For a split second, I\u2019m eye level with him. His bloodlust ones stare hard into my human ones. He doesn\u2019t see me, Riley Poe. He sees what he craves, what surges within my still-human veins, and his body is propelled by the desire to have it. My blood. Yet he cocks his head to the side, studying me. Again, hesitating.</p><p>Dread fills my insides, even as I slide my hand to the back of my pants and grip the hilt of a silver blade. I ease it out. Without changing expression, Eli\u2019s fingers tighten around my throat, and my eyes bulge from the pressure. His other hand covers mine holding the blade, and he squeezes until the pain is too much and I drop it.</p><p>He\u2019s going to lunge. Sink his teeth into me. Drain me of blood until I\u2019m an empty shell, then throw me aside. I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m paralyzed. With fear, dread, and an overwhelming broken heart. My brother\u2019s face flashes before me, Preacher\u2019s and Estelle\u2019s, Nyx\u2019s, even my dog Chaz\u2019s. I\u2019ll never see my loved ones again. . . .</p><p>My eyes close. I\u2019m powerless to move him.</p><p>I\u2019m going to die by Eli\u2019s hands. . . .</p><p>Then, unbelievably, he loosens his grip, and I\u2019m free. . . .</p><p>My eyes snap open, just in time to see Eli smash into a tree.</p><p>Standing before me, Valerian Arcos stares down at me. His face is unmorphed, aristocratic, and beautiful. Perfect. He smiles at me, reaches a hand toward me. \u201cCome to me, my love. At last.\u201d</p><p>My feet begin to move. Toward him. His full lips pull over perfect white teeth in a victorious smile. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he croons. \u201cCome here, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I focus. Concentrate. Imagine my core a fireball of energy.</p><p>Valerian merely smiles at me wider. \u201cStop that, Riley. \u2019Tis a waste of time. You should know me well enough by now. When I desire something, I get it. Just like I desired Carrine\u2019s power to coerce you into killing Dupr\u00e9,\u201d he sighs. \u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t count on him fighting her control so much. Nor her being so rebellious.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Eli, who is standing now. Shaking off his injury.</p><p>\u201cOh, wait,\u201d Valerian says. \u201cYou took care of her rather well, my darling. You have quite the power within in. But trust me. I have full Strigoi in my veins. You\u2019ve got . . . simply a dusting of it. And by the way, your little message to my idiot brother? He always was a weak one. He didn\u2019t have the balls to tell my father.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cJust so you know.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. Hatred pools inside me. Not a feeling I relish, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see here. Ah yes. Let me finish this . . . distraction.\u201d He glances at Eli. \u201cShall you do the honors?\u201d Valerian asks me. He grins. \u201cYes. I think you should. I can\u2019t very well be the cause of a vampiric war, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t work this time, Valerian,\u201d I challenge. I grin.</p><p>\u201cWe shall see.\u201d His expression hardens. \u201cGo to him. To Eli. And take your silver and plunge it into his heart. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>My fireball core is boiling hot. I stand, staring at Valerian. Again, I grin. And I don\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cGo now!\u201d he commands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel his will, his strength, trying to penetrate my core; it doesn\u2019t. I smile at him. \u201cGo fuck yourself, Arcos.\u201d</p><p>Valerian\u2019s brow pulls into a hideous frown. \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll risk a war\u2014\u201d</p><p>Everything happens so fast after that.</p> <p>Valerian\u2019s features morph into that of the hideous Strigoi bloodsucker that he is. He lunges at Eli, and I throw my cored energy into my legs and leap at them both. Valerian and Eli are entangled, fighting, jaws snapping, and I wedge between the two and, with all the power I can control, throw Eli as far as I can. His body sails, knocking over tombstone after tombstone like dominoes as he crashes. Only then, once I see Eli on the ground, do I feel the piercing of skin, ripping of artery, and fiery intrusion of Valerian\u2019s poisoned toxic fang as it enters me. I turn and look at him, my hand flying to my throat. He snaps back, his face confused, contorted. Filled with agony. I stumble backward, something warm and sticky trickling between my fingers at my throat. Already, my vision begins to blur.</p><p>A rumble rises, roars, and vibrates within me as a body flies past and rocks into Valerian. I shake my head to clear my vision. Shock steals my breath.</p><p>Victorian Arcos, in one fierce twist, takes the head of his very own brother.</p><p>Another roar pulls my attention back to Eli. I\u2019m falling now, stumbling like I\u2019ve had too much tequila, and I see another figure fighting him. They tangle, twist, and the other figure throws his head back, dreads pulled into a queue, and Noah sinks his jagged fangs into Eli\u2019s throat.</p><p>I stumble back, horrified, dizzy, and I hit the ground on my backside. My energy is spent. My scatha\u2014I\u2019ve been clutching it the whole time\u2014drops from my hands. I fall back on the cold cemetery ground and stare skyward. No stars. Just blackness. Oh yeah, I\u2019m in an alternative world. Nothing\u2019s real here anyway except the creatures and souls within. . . .</p> <p>Victorian\u2019s flawless face and warm brown eyes stare down at me. His mouth is moving furiously, and he is shouting my name. I can\u2019t hear him. But it\u2019s my name. He grips my shoulders and shakes me, and he falls to his knees and scoops me up. He must be running with me . . . somewhere. My body begins to convulse, my breath quickens, stops in my lungs, and I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m clawing at Victorian\u2019s shirt, his hair, but he\u2019s running fast, his head turned yelling at someone over his shoulder. I can\u2019t hear who. His face is drawn tight in fury and concern, but he doesn\u2019t look down at me again. I think I see tears streaming down his face. Fear pits my stomach, but I can only stare. Only straight ahead. I grow weak fast, and now my arms fall helpless. I feel like I\u2019m floating again. Where\u2019s Noah? Please, God, please at least let Noah get out. A black curtain is pulled over my eyes, wrapped around my head until I can\u2019t breathe, and I see nothing, hear nothing . . .</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Nausea. Ears drumming. Voices. I don\u2019t know where I am. I try to get up, can\u2019t move my arms. My legs. I can\u2019t even turn my head. Eyes won\u2019t open. Pain. My flesh is ripping apart!</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s moving around too much,\u201d a voice says.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t break out of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that the last time she broke out of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up and just tighten them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tighten them.\u201d</p><p>I try to speak. My mouth is frozen, stuck in place, like my lips are sewn together</p><p>Finally, I give up. . . .</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Pain roars through me, skidding along every nerve and pathway inside my body, and I scream so hard my insides quiver. I still can\u2019t see\u2014something\u2019s tied around my eyes. I force my core energy to my arms, my legs, and I push so hard with my mind that whatever\u2019s holding them down flies off. Curses, shouts, as whatever I\u2019m in rocks back and forth, jolting me forward. I catch myself, and just as my fingers fly to my eyes to remove the blind, a body hits me. We crash to the floor.</p><p>Suddenly, I\u2019m overcome by a powerful sense of . . . sexuality. Erotica. Deep-core horniness that makes me scream and grope at the body pinning me down.</p><p>\u201cSomeone better fucking hurry up over here,\u201d the voice on top of me says. \u201cIf she gets loose, someone\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>His breath brushes my lips as he speaks. I reach, wriggle beneath him. Gotta have him . . .</p><p>\u201cHold her still,\u201d a voice says.</p><p>\u201cI might like her kind of trouble,\u201d a new voice comments. Accent . . . funny. Hard to understand. Familiar.</p><p>\u201cThis is as still as she gets,\u201d the voices says on top of me. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>A pinprick, and as soon as the sensation has begun to claw at the body hovering over me, it disappears. I settle, ease, and the pain leaves me as I drift into a weightless black cloud of nothingness. . . .</p><p>The ebb and flow of waves against the shore pull me out of my deep slumber. The heavy brine of salt and sea life wash over me, and I inhale. Familiar.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d a voice says gently. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m on my back, a thick softness below me, and a chilly breeze lifts my hair. I open my eyes and blink rapidly as the light pours in. Finally, my eyes can tolerate the sudden change and I focus on the figure kneeling beside me. His face grows closer, and he reaches out and strokes my cheek. I lift my hand and thread my fingers through his.</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d I say, and my voice comes out croaky and broken. My throat feels as if someone has dragged a handful of thorns across it.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he says, and covers my lips with his finger. He leans closer, mercury eyes searching my face. \u201cHow ya feeling?\u201d</p><p>I look at him. \u201cMy whole body aches.\u201d My gaze goes beyond Noah\u2019s figure, to the lean-to palm roof I\u2019m lying under. Several feet away, the edges of the sea wash up onto the shore. It\u2019s late afternoon, and a low sun falls somewhere behind us. \u201cI\u2019m at Da Island?\u201d</p><p>Noah nods. \u201cYeah, darlin\u2019, you are.\u201d</p><p>I stare up at the palms covering my head. Fear chokes me into a panic, and my breath hitches in my throat, quickens. \u201cNoah?\u201d I don\u2019t even know what to ask, or what to say. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d he asks. His hand squeezes mine.</p><p>I concentrate. \u201cThe realm. Victorian.\u201d I squeeze my eyes shut. \u201cJesus Christ, he killed his brother,\u201d I say. Then my eyes flash open and I force myself to sit up. \u201cYou,\u201d I say on a painful whisper. \u201cEli\u2014you bit him. Noah, Christ\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d Noah says with a smile. \u201cFine, no, not yet. Far from it. He\u2019s in deep detox. Deeper than you, Riley. Couldn\u2019t even keep him on the same island as you. I\u2019m surprised even on the same continent. He\u2019s not out of the woods yet. He\u2019s . . . in it bad.\u201d</p><p>I sit back and my brain hurts from trying to sort things out. I push my fingertips to my temples, massaging, trying to force the memories out. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d</p><p>Noah chuckles, and another biting breeze whips through. \u201cYeah, I guess you don\u2019t. Another hell of a plane ride. Had to take two jets. You on one, Eli on the other.\u201d</p><p>I stare up at the fading sun peeking through the makeshift roof made of scrub palms and pine limbs. I\u2019m not as settled as I should be, hearing that Eli made it out of the realm. \u201cTell me everything, Noah,\u201d I say. Tears choke my throat and claw behind my eyes, and finally, they escape. \u201cWhere\u2019s my brother? Preacher? Victorian? Rhine?\u201d</p><p>Noah reaches over with a finger and wipes my cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me here, darlin\u2019. We have the island to ourselves. Rhine and the Ness boys are fine. Had to make that young pup return to Inverness. He wanted to come here, watch over you, insisted on flying back with us. He left a couple of weeks ago, and he calls or texts me every day, asking about you. And yes, everyone else is . . . alive.\u201d He narrows his eyes. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re up to this?\u201d</p><p>With a gusty sigh, I nod. \u201cMight as well be.\u201d Relief washes over me. Rhine and the boys are safe. Everyone is alive.</p><p>Noah scoots close, pulls me up in his arms, and settles me against his chest. He pulls the patchwork quilt\u2014one I recognize is made by my Gullah grandma, Estelle\u2014over my legs and waist. \u201cThis is going to take all night.\u201d</p><p>Part Ten</p><p> SACRED VOWS</p><p>I\u2019m your density. I mean . . . your destiny.</p><p>\u2014George McFly to Lorraine Baines, Back to the Future, 1985</p><p>Before this is all over I am probably going to lose my mind. I don\u2019t remember ever being so off track and restless. I\u2019ve got chunks of time missing in my memory, and I can\u2019t seem to get a straight answer out of anyone. What I thought was one thing turns out to be something else. What have I become? Something feels different this time, something inside me is different. Almost . . . like I have two people inside me. Or more.</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what?\u201d I ask, almost jerking out of the comfort of Noah\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cSettle down, wildcat,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s mid-January.\u201d</p><p>No longer comforted, I sit up, turn around, and face Noah. He\u2019s sitting with his back against the pile of quilts and pillows. \u201cHow in the hell can it be mid-January, Noah? We were in Inverness in early November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I blink, awaiting a decent answer.</p><p>Where has all the time gone?</p><p>Noah rests his forearms against his drawn-up knees and looks at me. \u201cDo you remember everything that happened in the realm?\u201d</p><p>I think about it. \u201cI killed Carrine. Then Eli attacked me.\u201d I look at him. \u201cValerian tried to make me kill Eli. But . . .\u201d I think hard, my memories starting to blur. \u201cVictorian showed up. He killed Valerian.\u201d Panic rises in my throat. \u201cI saw you . . . bite Eli. Then Vic picked me up and ran. Everything else is a . . . blur.\u201d</p><p>Noah nods, his gaze locking on to mine. \u201cIt\u2019s called a cluster fuck, Riley. I had to subdue Eli. He was . . . out-of-control sick. His bloodlust . . .\u201d He shakes his head, and a long dread falls over his shoulder. \u201cIt was greater than any I\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cEver.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do, Noah?\u201d I ask. My fear has risen and turned to bile. My stomach hurts.</p><p>\u201cI gave him my venom. Maybe too much. It was the only thing to do at the time. He was going apeshit crazy in there. It made him calm enough to get him out of the realm and back to the Crachan. I had him in chains by the time Jake and Gabriel showed up. And then, hell. There was you.\u201d</p><p>I look at him, waiting.</p> <p>\u201cJake, Gabriel, and Luc took one jet with Eli, back to Savannah. I grabbed another one with you, Seth, Phin, Rhine, and Arcos. Preacher, his cousin Garr, and Eli\u2019s parents were waiting for us at the airport. Preacher accompanied Eli\u2019s parents to the other island with Eli. Jake, Gabriel, and Luc went, too. Garr set us up here. Arcos, on another island.\u201d</p><p>I cock my head, puzzled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugs. \u201cBetween Preacher and Garr, and Eli\u2019s parents, they insisted that if Arcos was going to hang around here, he had to be cleansed. It didn\u2019t take long. He was pretty cooperative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Noah rubs his chin with his hands. \u201cLucky for us, Vic killed his own brother, instead of me killing Valerian. He\u2019s back in Romania right now, clearing things up with his family.\u201d</p> <p>I notice Noah is telling me everything there is to know about everyone . . . except me.</p><p>And that\u2019s got me a little worried.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here alone?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Noah\u2019s penetrating, serious silver gaze makes my heart leap. \u201cNoah?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cThe bite you took from Valerian Arcos?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant for you. It was meant for Eli. To kill him.\u201d</p><p>I blink, confused. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou . . . went through a few changes.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ve had Arcos venom before, Noah\u2014three times. Why is this different?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cArcos venom overload? Don\u2019t exactly know yet, Riley. But your DNA may have . . . crossed over.\u201d</p><p>The air swooshes out of my lungs. \u201cCrossed over? As in full-blown vampire?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s hand reaches for mine, and he squeezes. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure yet. You\u2019ve been detoxed in the most aggressive ways possible. Eli, too. And Victorian. Going on nine weeks now.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cEli . . . he\u2019s not exactly remembering things, Ri.\u201d He stares at me. \u201cLast time I saw him, he didn\u2019t remember me. He may not remember you.\u201d</p><p>My heart plummets. I thought all we had to do was get him alive. Detox him. The thought never crossed my mind that Eli wouldn\u2019t remember me. His family. His old life. I take a deep breath and push myself to my feet. My legs are wobbly, weak, and Noah\u2019s up and beside me. His hand slips under my elbow, and I look up at him. \u201cWhy are we here alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEli needed all hands, so to speak. Once your detox was complete, and you only needed a guardian, I volunteered. The others are all with Preacher and Garr at the other island. Besides . . .\u201d He gives me a warm smile. \u201cA vow\u2019s a vow. I promised Eli I would keep you safe. Remember?\u201d</p><p>I lean my head on his shoulder. \u201cYeah, I do. And I appreciate it.\u201d Outside the makeshift lean-to, the waves roll up onto the sand. \u201cI need to walk,\u201d I say.</p> <p>Noah drapes an arm over my shoulders and guides me out. \u201cThen let\u2019s walk.\u201d</p><p>We start out of the lean-to, and I stop, looking up. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say.</p><p>Noah flashes a grin\u2014different from the sexy, cocky one he usually portrays. \u201cAnytime.\u201d As we walk, he reaches in the pocket of his jeans and pulls out his cell.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake,\u201d he says into the phone, and hangs up.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m barefoot, and the sand squishes between my toes as we walk along the shoreline. Gulls scream overhead, and sandpipers scurry along the tide, poking their long beaks into the sand. The familiar briny scent washes over me, and I breathe it in. It settles me, comforts me. It\u2019s home.</p><p>Noah pulls me against him. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. And by the way . . . I saw what you did with Carrine.\u201d Affection and admiration lighten his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re sick, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I give a wan smile. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Noah kisses the top of my head. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up on Eli, darlin\u2019. No one\u2019s giving up on him. You got that?\u201d</p><p>His words comfort me. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Riley? How are you, love?</p><p>Vic . . . I\u2019m fine. How are you?</p><p>Ready to leave this drafty old Arcos castle. I just wanted to hear your voice. I\u2019ll be along to the States as soon as I can. Please, mind your Gullah brethren. And mind Miles. I beg you.</p><p>I will, I will. See ya soon, Vic.</p><p>Not soon enough.</p><p>A few minutes later, the purr of a boat motor carries across the inlet, and as the sun\u2019s setting I see the boat heading toward us. Two dark figures, and a handful of light ones.</p><p>The boat pushes up onto shore, and my heart leaps.</p><p>\u201cDere\u2019s my girl,\u201d Estelle says, her beautiful ebony skin splitting at the mouth in a wide grin, showing off her stark-white teeth. \u201cSomebody git me outta dis ting.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s brother Phin scoops her up, and Estelle squeals like a little girl. He sets her in the sand, and she makes her way to me. I rush into her arms and squeeze her tight.</p><p>\u201cGrandma!\u201d I say into her neck. She smells of spices and Dial soap, and it\u2019s never smelled so good.</p><p>Estelle pats me on the back several times. \u201cOh, now. Dere, dere, child. Don\u2019t go gettin\u2019 my dress all wet, right?\u201d She laughs, and the familiar sound goes straight to my soul. \u201cI\u2019m almost too old to be jumpin\u2019 from island to island, watchin\u2019 out for you young\u2019ns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRi!\u201d Seth says, leaping out of the boat and rushing over to me. Estelle steps back and my baby brother wraps his arms around me and picks me up. \u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u201d he says into my hair. He pulls back, and is searching me all over, as though he might find a cut or a scratch, or something out of place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Seth,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou wasn\u2019t so fine before, girl,\u201d Preacher says, ambling up to me with a slight limp. His dark eyes regard me. \u201cYou might not be too fine now.\u201d He smiles. \u201cBut we\u2019ll keep ya, dat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and throw my arms around my surrogate root-doctor grandfather\u2019s neck. \u201cPreacher Man,\u201d I say against him, then kiss his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, and that odder Arcos boy,\u201d he says. \u201cNot so bad. But your fianc\u00e9? He\u2019s been a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can I see him?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Preacher\u2019s dark face stares back at me. \u201cSoon. Not now.\u201d</p><p>Phin walks over and pulls me away from Preacher. \u201c\u2019Bout time you woke up,\u201d he says, and kisses me. \u201cYou scared us all for a while, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, too, gar\u00e7on,\u201d I joke.</p><p>\u201cWe thought you were in a quickening,\u201d Phin says, and concern replaces his usual joking gaze. \u201cFreaked me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still don\u2019t know, boy, so watch your neck,\u201d Estelle says, and giggles to herself. \u201cDat girl bites you, it\u2019s gonna be bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s staying with Eli now?\u201d I ask. We all walk toward the lean-to. Seth and Noah pull out lawn chairs, and we all sit.</p><p>\u201cPa-pa, Jake Andorra, Garr, and Gabriel,\u201d Phin says. \u201cMa m\u00e8re and Josie remained in the city with Nyx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been quiet,\u201d Seth says. \u201cVic went back home to deal with his family. But he\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>I sit in the sand at the feet of my surrogate grandparents, and let their conversation wash over me. I\u2019m home. I don\u2019t know how right I am, but I\u2019m home. There\u2019s something missing, a piece of me that feels incomplete, and I know it\u2019s Eli. The fear that he won\u2019t remember me terrifies me. I guess I could go on in my life\u2014whatever that is now\u2014and carry on, being content that at least, he\u2019s alive. But I\u2019m greedy, and I want more than that.</p><p>I want him.</p><p>I\u2019m not too sure how long I can wait to find out if he wants me, too.</p><p>Or just wants to kill me.</p><p>Preacher decides he\u2019s happy with my recovery but wants me and Noah to remain on Da Island a few more days. A thought suddenly comes to me, and I pull from my grandfather\u2019s arms and look at him.</p><p>\u201cAre his eyes still red?\u201d</p><p>Preacher gives a short nod. \u201cThey are, yeah.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cDere\u2019s somethin\u2019 missin\u2019, dat\u2019s right. But I don\u2019t know what it is yet.\u201d He kisses my nose. \u201cWe\u2019ll figger it out, girl. Don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s progressin\u2019 good enough, I reckon.\u201d</p><p>After hugs and kisses and tears, everyone leaves me and Noah alone. Seth accompanies Estelle back to Da Plat Eye, where she and Preacher live in the shop\u2019s upstairs apartment. Preacher and Phin head back to Eli.</p><p>Eli\u2019s eyes are still red. And everyone expects me to just sit . . . and wait?</p><p>I am Strogoi. I am Dupr\u00e9. And I am a Fallen.</p><p>I can do more than just kick a little ass now.</p><p>\u201cI do not like that look in your eye.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, as I hear the purr of Preacher\u2019s boat fade in the distance, I smile at Noah.</p><p>He does not smile back.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d he warns. \u201cWhatever it is you\u2019re cookin\u2019 in that pretty little head of yours, stop.\u201d</p><p>I take a step toward him. \u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>His hand eases up, reaches down his shirt, and grasps his satchel of herbs. \u201cDon\u2019t make me throw this in the water.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I shake my head. \u201cAre you seriously using your sex appeal against me, Noah Miles?\u201d He grins. \u201cTsk-tsk, you crazy vampire.\u201d Take your sexy backside and go sit in the lean-to. Now.</p><p>Without hesitation, Noah drops his hand from his satchel, turns, and walks into the lean-to. He plops down on the pile of stacked quilts.</p><p>And simply sits.</p><p>Dusk has taken over the sky, throwing swirls and lines of purple and gray and burnt orange in a canopy overhead. I listen closely to Preacher\u2019s boat motor, and gauge the direction. A quick glance at my beach attire\u2014cutoff jeans and a fuchsia Inksomnia T-shirt\u2014and I decide that will do just fine in the chilly winter waters of the Atlantic. I turn my gaze to the end of Da Island, two hundred feet of shoreline and sand, and I launch myself into a full run. Ten feet from the edge I gather my strength and leap, landing thirty feet in a dive. The water rushes over my head, and I kick a few times before surfacing. Taking a deep breath, I turn in the direction of Eli\u2019s island. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swim. Fast and hard.</p><p>An old fear rises while I swim, and I laugh it off. Sharks? Hell, I\u2019ll punch one in the nose now, no second thought. Within a few minutes, I see the lights strung in front of a lean-to similar to mine, and Preacher\u2019s boat is just pulling up onto the sand. I stop, wade in the water, and wait for Preacher and Phin to get out. Then Seth and Estelle leave, cutting across the sound toward Savannah.</p><p>I ease toward the other side of the island and climb to shore. Soaking wet, but unaffected by the cold, I creep toward Preacher\u2019s camp. Remaining are Gilles, Preacher, Jake, Gabriel, Garr, and Phin.</p> <p>That\u2019s three vampires, two powerful root doctors, and . . . whatever Gabriel is. Plus Eli.</p><p>Seven. Against me.</p><p>Whatever I am.</p><p>I got this.</p><p>Through the maritime scrub forest, I make my way to the opposite shore. When I see Preacher and Garr, standing just outside the lean-to, I stop. Everyone except Eli is outside, by the shore. I close my eyes and concentrate. Pushing my energy until it forms a fiery ball in my center. I will it outward, to my fingertips.</p> <p>And then like some crazy half-cocked inked wizard, I point my hands in their direction.</p><p>Everyone take a seat. Do it now.</p><p>To my surprise, every single one of them scrambles to find a seat in the sand by the shore.</p><p>Look nowhere except out to sea. Ignore me. Ignore Eli. Only stare out to sea. And stay in your seat.</p><p>As if on cue, every one of their heads turn toward the water. Since there were only two lawn chairs out, Gilles and Preacher take those. The others plop right down onto the sand. Still as zombies, they stare out.</p><p>I smile to myself and make my way to the lean-to.</p> <p>Palm fronds and pine needles crunch under my bare feet as I push open the quilted doorway and look inside. Eli is lying on a pallet, similar to the one I was on earlier. He looks so peaceful, lying there with his eyes closed, his full, sexy lips soft, slightly parted. His dark hair sweeps over one side of his face, obscuring his eye.</p><p>A stick snaps behind me, and I look over my shoulder. A rabbit looks up at me, then hops away, startled. His little white tail flips in the dark.</p><p>When I glance back, I gasp.</p><p>Eli\u2019s gone.</p><p>The hair stiffens on my neck, on my arms, and I know before I look, he\u2019s behind me. Slowly, I turn.</p><p>Bloodred eyes stare down at me. Wordlessly, yet with a gentleness that surprises me, Eli grabs my throat with one hand.</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>Then I rear back with my free hand and punch him in the side of the head.</p> <p>His hand drops from my throat.</p><p>My knee goes up\u2014hard\u2014into his groin, and he groans.</p><p>I don\u2019t wait for a reaction. I take off.</p><p>Scrub palms and thick underbrush scrape my legs and feet as I rush through the maritime forest, and Eli\u2019s right on my tail. He lunges, grabs my feet, and we both go down.</p><p>I turn and kick him in the jaw, and he flies backward. I scramble up on hands and knees and cut a path through the wood. Just as the sandy beach is in my view, I\u2019m tackled. Eli and I hit the ground in a tangled grunt, and I writhe and clobber him with a piece of driftwood I find next to us. He rolls off me and I\u2019m up and running again. I leap, hit the water, and start swimming. The big splash behind me lets me know Eli\u2019s not giving up.</p><p>Good.</p><p>My arms cut the water, my legs scissor fast, and I swim as hard as I can to the next little barrier island in the sound. The shore in sight, I kick into high gear, and before long the sandy bottom settles under my feet and I pull myself up onto shore.</p><p>Just as I right myself, I\u2019m hit from behind and fall face-first in the sand. The wind is knocked out of me, and a big body lands full-on atop me. My shoulders are grabbed, and I\u2019m flipped over. My hands are trapped, held above my head.</p><p>Eli stares down at me, his face drawn in puzzled fury. Bloodred eyes blazing. Confusion. An inner struggle.</p><p>I focus. Stare fearlessly into those eyes. Eligius, it\u2019s me. Riley. Your fianc\u00e9e. Please remember me. I demand you remember me!</p><p>He cocks his head to the side, studying me hard. His dark eyebrows furrow.</p><p>I\u2019ve missed you, Eli. Come here. Lower. Press your mouth against mine.</p><p>Eli hesitates; then slowly, he lowers his head. I brace myself, those venomous teeth inches from my throat.</p><p>I\u2019m lost the second Eli\u2019s lips press against mine. He doesn\u2019t move, doesn\u2019t taste. Just . . . lets them be against mine. I inhale, and only then do I notice . . . I can inhale. Air into my lungs. My heart is pounding.</p><p>I have a heart.</p><p>Eli\u2019s scent seeps into me, and yet I keep my eyes fastened on his, so close to me.</p><p>Kiss me, Eligius Dupr\u00e9. Kiss me like you mean it. Kiss me and remember. . . .</p><p>Eli\u2019s mouth settles, shifts, and nudges mine apart. His tongue brushes against mine and he kisses me. Gentle at first, he explores and tastes. I lose myself, pushing aside the thought that I\u2019m commanding him to do this with my Fallen powers, to kiss me like this, and it\u2019s not really Eli, but a puppet. At the moment, I don\u2019t care. Couldn\u2019t care less, actually. I can make out with an Eli puppet.</p><p>All I think about is Eli\u2019s body pressing into mine, his fingers entwined with mine, pushing our hands into the sand, and his mouth moving erotically over mine. . . .</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d he whispers against me. His voice is throaty, raspy, and his hands move from mine to hold my head on either side. He rises, looks at me. With those bloodred eyes fastened to mine, he kisses me again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk me into kissing you, ch\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>My heart leaps\u2014and at the same time, confusion webs my brain. \u201cEli?\u201d I dare to breathe his name. I\u2019m scared it\u2019s all going to fade away. That he\u2019ll morph, grab me, kill me. My heart slams against my ribs, and my breath lodges in my throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he says, and presses his lips to mine again. \u201cWhy\u2019d you run?\u201d</p><p>I look at my fianc\u00e9, wide-eyed at first, and then I laugh. \u201cBecause you . . . chased me!\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s head drops, his hands move down my body, and he\u2019s kissing me so deep, so hard, the sand bites into my back, my head. A deep-throated groan escapes his throat, and it rumbles against my chest. \u201cGod, woman,\u201d he says, almost whispering, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could last another day without you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m kissing him back, and running out of breath doing it. I don\u2019t care. \u201cEli, your eyes,\u201d I manage in between kisses. \u201cThey\u2019re still red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, tracing my lips with his tongue, then sucking on the bottom one. He rolls, pulls me on top, and I stare down at him, amazed. He grazes my jaw with his thumb. \u201cPreacher says they\u2019ll eventually turn back, but for now, I\u2019m stuck with them.\u201d</p><p>I throw my head back and laugh, and then fall into a long, sexy kiss with my fianc\u00e9. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re okay,\u201d I breathe. \u201cEli, I\u2019ve never been so scared in all my life.\u201d</p><p>His hands are gripping my thighs, and trails up my back. \u201cMe, too, baby,\u201d he admits. He holds my jaw steady, threads his free hand through my hair. \u201cI can\u2019t stop looking at you.\u201d</p><p>I shove my hands into his silky hair and kiss him softly, and he lies still while I explore his mouth. I suck his bottom lip, slowly, then trace his teeth with my tongue. The unshaven scruff on his jaw against my palm turns me on and makes me writhe against him. I slide my hand down his throat, and he runs his hands over my bared thighs and pulls me hard against him and deepens the kiss. My mind goes completely blank as his tongue slowly grazes mine, and his mouth moves erotically over my lips, and everywhere his hands touch makes me burn for him. On fire.</p><p>Then he stops.</p><p>\u201cRiley.\u201d He looks at me as I pull back, out of breath.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cCan we get married now?\u201d</p><p>The moonlight is dim, only a slice hanging low above the water, and it casts Eli\u2019s face into sexy planes and shadows. His teeth gleam white as he grins.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cAre you safe?\u201d I inquire. \u201cI mean, you were being guarded by vampires, root doctors, and . . . whatever Gabriel is.\u201d I brush his bottom lip with my fingertip. \u201cAre you . . . dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were just taking extra precautions. I want to get married. Soon. And get off this island.\u201d He pulls my bottom harder against him, and I feel his arousal pushing against me. \u201cI want you, every day.\u201d He nuzzles me.</p><p>Suddenly, my eyes fill with tears. \u201cEli,\u201d I say, and the thoughts of the recent past are choking me, making me hyperventilate. \u201cEli, oh my God, I thought you were dead.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIn Edinburgh. It was the most pain I\u2019ve ever experienced. Then, with Carrine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRi, I\u2019m . . . so sorry,\u201d he says, and wipes away my tears. \u201cIn all of what\u2019s happened, I remember two things. One.\u201d He holds up one finger. \u201cThe hell I was stuck in after I left you at Waverly in Edinburgh.\u201d He closes his eyes briefly, as if pushing aside horrifying memories. \u201cTwo, you, head-to-toe leather, the scatha, dragging me and Victorian Arcos down a gravelly street by our wrists.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to speak, but I saw you, and all I could think was That\u2019s my woman. She\u2019s dared an alternative Hell, and has rescued me.\u201d A smile tugs at his lips. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you were badass, Riley, but Jesus.\u201d</p><p>I sniff, and smile. \u201cI\u2019d die for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could, I\u2019d die for you, too,\u201d he answers me, and pulls me close. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what I did while in Inverness\u2014only what Miles has told me. I have flashes, though\u2014of you, trying to get through to me. And you did. Even if for a split second, I remembered.\u201d His lips move over mine, frantic, desperate, and every fear he\u2019s ever had, I feel, and I drink him in. He raises his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. For all the hell I\u2019ve put you through. I have a pain inside that won\u2019t stop, and I know it\u2019s from the things I\u2019ve done. I tried hard to fight it, not to drink human blood. I tried hard as hell.\u201d</p><p>With my knuckles, I graze his jaw. The contempt and self-loathing I see in the depths of his red eyes nearly choke me. I can\u2019t imagine his suffering. I look at him hard, long. \u201cYet look at us now.\u201d I smile. \u201cWe survived all of that. And we\u2019re here, together.\u201d I kiss him. \u201cForever. And this is the last time you need ever mention apologies, Eli. You were not you. A freaking witchpire had you under her dark control.\u201d I narrow my eyes. \u201cI kicked her ass to Hell, by the way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One side of his sexy mouth lifts in a half grin. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>For a few moments, we\u2019re silent, just drinking each other in.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Eli breathes against my mouth. \u201cYou. Me. Nuptials.\u201d His fingers lace through mine, and his brow lifts. \u201cWhere\u2019s your engagement ring?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApril,\u201d I answer. \u201cBest time of year in Savannah for a wedding. And I left it in Savannah, safe with your mom, so it wouldn\u2019t get lost.\u201d</p><p>Eli breaks the kiss. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to remedy that, first thing. And April? That\u2019s . . . weeks away.\u201d</p><p>I grin, start to rise. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d he says, and fastens his hands at my hips. \u201cWhere are you going, ma ch\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, and trust me when I say it, it is not easy, \u201cwe have to save something sacred for our wedding night.\u201d I leap off him and stand, leaving Eli lying in the sand. \u201cFrom now until our wedding night, consider yourself celibate.\u201d</p> <p>Eli\u2019s mouth drops open. It makes his red eyes even more menacing. \u201cWhat?\u201d He leaps up, grasps my shoulders. \u201cRi, we\u2019ve had . . . tons of sex!\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cYeah, I remember. Every single time. A lot of it nasty.\u201d I rise and brush my lips across his. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ll have to savor those memories until we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I changed my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to get married yet.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and lace my fingers through his. \u201cToo late. Won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s face draws into a mask of pure agony. He pushes his hands through his tangled wet hair. \u201cOh, Jesus Christ. I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die, Eli. Besides,\u201d I say, experiencing a bit of agony myself, \u201cit\u2019ll be worth it. Trust me.\u201d</p> <p>Eli\u2019s red eye peeks from between his fingers. \u201cThat alone makes it worth it.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, and my fianc\u00e9 pulls me into his embrace. He holds me, our bodies still soaked from our swim, and his chin rests on top of my head. \u201cAre we going to be okay, Eli?\u201d I ask. Uncertainty clouds my joy, and a worry starts in the pit of my stomach. \u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more alive,\u201d he whispers. \u201cThe one thing that was lacking in my detox was you.\u201d He grasps both sides of my face with his hands and stares at me. \u201cI don\u2019t remember much, except the pain. But the one thing I do remember is thinking, What am I missing? Something\u2019s not right, something is supposed to be here, and it\u2019s not.\u201d He smiles, and the moonlight glances off his jaw. He\u2019s so sexy it hurts. \u201cYou. I felt empty, dead without you.\u201d</p><p>Love and contentment spread through me, and I realize now that, no matter what else happens, we can handle it. We\u2019ll be okay. I frown then, staring up at him. \u201cSwear to God, Eli. If those creepy red eyes of yours aren\u2019t changed back to that engaging cerulean blue by the wedding, you have to get contacts.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me then, and I fall into his embrace. After the kiss starts to get heated, I pull back and peck him on the jaw. \u201cDo you remember the first time we were together?\u201d</p><p>Eli cocks a dark eyebrow. \u201cTogether together?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYes. That.\u201d</p><p>He lowers his head and brushes his lips to mine. \u201cEvery last detail.\u201d</p> <p>I breathe him in, and the memory of it rocks me. . . .</p><p>The brush of his tongue against mine, his skin, my skin, bare and moving together. His hand caressing every inch of me, his mouth making love to mine. The way he completely filled me, rocked me to my core, and made me all but crawl with need. I couldn\u2019t get enough. . . .</p><p>It takes me a few seconds to breathe, and when I do, my eyes flutter open and stare into Eli\u2019s bloodred ones.</p><p>A grin lifts his mouth. \u201cDamn, Poe.\u201d</p><p>Strangely enough, I feel a blush creep up my neck. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like we . . . watched. Us. Together.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen. \u201cYou saw that?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s deep laugh cracks the night. \u201cYeah. I damn sure did.\u201d</p><p>My mouth goes dry at the memory. \u201cMaybe we can negotiate the celibacy.\u201d</p><p>Lacing his fingers through mine, Eli pulls me to the water. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Poe. You called it. Now let\u2019s go free up all the folks you mind-whammied.\u201d He kisses me one last time. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wedding to plan.\u201d</p><p>Even as we both dive into the chilled Atlantic water, my mind can\u2019t wrap around the fact that Eli is okay, he recognizes me, and we\u2019ll be getting married in a handful of weeks. As we swim together through the darkness, I realize Eli is more than my fianc\u00e9. Way more than the best sex I\u2019ve ever had or ever will have.</p><p>He\u2019s my other half. My mate.</p><p>For as long as I live.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>NUPTIALS</p><p>Unorthodox doesn\u2019t even cover it.</p><p>And I say this with all the love and affection I have in my heart.</p><p>This is one fucked-up life I have.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>I\u2019m staring out of my balcony, over River Street and at the Savannah River. It\u2019s been weeks since I awoke on the little barrier island with Noah, and then zapped him and, Jesus, even old Preacher Man, into a zombielike state, all so I could get my fianc\u00e9 alone. Just to see if he\u2019d remember me.</p><p>Oh, remember he did.</p><p>I almost beat the hell out of him. He wasn\u2019t so gentle with me, either. I kinda dug it, too.</p><p>In the distance, the clop-clop of a horse pulling a carriage makes his way through the moss-draped oaks of Savannah\u2019s historic district. The brine off the river is refreshing, slightly pungent. Perfect. The sun is shining. There\u2019s a slight chill in the air. And not a mosquito in sight. How perfect is that?</p><p>Today\u2019s April seventh. My wedding day. I can barely wrap my brain around it.</p><p>And I\u2019m marrying a two-hundred-plus-year-old vampire.</p><p>That\u2019s not as hard to grasp as one might think.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God!\u201d My door flies open, and my best friend, Nyx, rushes into my apartment. I\u2019ve set the living room up as a getting-ready bridal suite, with a long full-length oak mirror in one corner. I\u2019m standing in front of it now, and Nyx sashays up behind me. She slips her arms around my middle and hugs my bare back.</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful, Riley!\u201d she exclaims, looking over my shoulder at my reflection in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much. I was so scared you wouldn\u2019t come home.\u201d</p><p>I smile at Nyxinnia Foster. She and Josie, Eli\u2019s little sister, are my bridesmaids, and we\u2019d gone shopping together. I\u2019d let them choose their dresses, and they\u2019d done a jam-up job.</p><p>Fuchsia silk, above the knee, with a haltered top, and a narrow black velvet strip just under the breast. Solid black wedge shoes. Black velvet chokers. Their bouquets are faded green hydrangea and calla lily. Both have their hair down and swept to the side with a black velvet clip. \u201cYou look beautiful yourself, Ms. Foster.\u201d</p><p>Nyx slips her hand over my shoulder and wiggles her ring finger, where a beautiful platinum engagement ring holds a fairly impressive cluster of sparkling diamonds. She grins. \u201cNot Foster for long,\u201d she sighs. \u201cWe\u2019ll actually be sisters, Ri. Isn\u2019t that exciting?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s brother, Luc, had asked Nyx to marry him. She\u2019d said yes.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t be happier.</p><p>I pull her gently to me and kiss her cheek. \u201cAlways sisters.\u201d</p><p>A tap at the door sounds, and we both jump, then burst into giggles. Phin and Luc both stick their heads in the door. \u201cEverybody decent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d Nyx and I both holler out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s a\u2014 Whoa.\u201d Phin lets out a low whistle. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cPerv.\u201d My gaze moves to Eli\u2019s other brother, Luc.</p><p>His eyes are bugged out as he inspects Nyx. \u201cYou two are the most gorgeous creatures I\u2019ve ever seen. In. My. Life.\u201d He walks over to Nyx and pulls her into a quick embrace and a kiss, then moves over to me. \u201cSister, I am speechless,\u201d he says, and studies me. \u201cEli is going to freak. You\u2019re breathtaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d I say, and I\u2019m surprised to find myself nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m freaking,\u201d Phin says with a grin.</p><p>\u201cBro, watch it\u2014that\u2019s my sister you\u2019re freaking over,\u201d my brother says, entering. His eyes light up when he sees me, and he hurries over to pull me into a gentle hug. \u201cMom would\u2019ve loved being here, you know? You look amazing. But . . . this feels so weird, Ri,\u201d he says against my hair. \u201cYou, getting married? Almost like I\u2019m losing you or something.\u201d</p><p>I pull back and look at my baby brother. \u201cI\u2019ll always be here,\u201d I assure him. \u201cAlways together, me and you. I promise. Despite Rhine and the Ness Boys asking you to join them in Inverness.\u201d</p><p>Seth grins. \u201cI haven\u2019t said no to that yet.\u201d</p><p>I return the smile. After what had gone down in Inverness, Rhine had asked Seth to join the Ness Boys. As in live there, with them at the Crachan, to keep Inverness and the Highlands safe. After Carrine\u2019s reign of terror, there\u2019s no telling how many newbloods are roaming the glen. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if Seth accepted, too, no matter that he\u2019s hesitating. Might be good for him, although he\u2019d probably have to take Eli\u2019s little sister, Josie. Now that I think about it, she\u2019d also be quite an asset to the Ness Boys. Knowing Rhine, it\u2019s probably his master cunning scheme of getting me back to Scotland. \u201cI know you haven\u2019t, but if you do, it\u2019s totally okay.\u201d I step back and admire. \u201cYou guys look fabuloso,\u201d I say. The guys are decked out in black tuxes and Luc and Phin each sport a fuchsia bow tie. Luc\u2019s dark blond hair brushes his tux collar. Phin\u2019s dark blond buzz cut makes him look simply badass. Both have blue eyes that sparkle. My brother? When did he grow up into such a handsome guy?</p><p>\u201cHeard all that,\u201d Phin says, reading my mind. He looks at Seth. \u201cShe thinks you\u2019re cute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I mock-glare at Phin.</p><p>Luc looks down at Nyx. \u201cReady, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should wed Riley, instead of Eli,\u201d Phin says, rubbing his jaw with a knuckle. He winks at me. \u201cHe\u2019s so damn old.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cPlease take him out of here,\u201d I tell Nyx.</p><p>She gives me a kiss on the cheek and links her arms between both brothers. \u201cSee ya out there,\u201d Nyx says sweetly. \u201cI can\u2019t wait! Come on, Seth Poe. You, too.\u201d</p><p>My brother gives me a sweet, wide smile. Words aren\u2019t needed. I\u2019ll always remember that smile of his, on this day. My wedding day.</p><p>Just as they step out the door, Noah walks in. He looks at me, and I grin.</p><p>\u201cGod Almighty, woman. You just killed me,\u201d he says, and walks to me. \u201cNo, wait. I\u2019m dying now.\u201d He places a hand over his heart. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Ri. It actually hurts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCut it out,\u201d I say, and twirl in a circle. \u201cToo much?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he says, and shakes his head as he studies me from head to toe. \u201cDupr\u00e9, that lucky fuck. He better thank me later that I didn\u2019t bite him a little longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah!\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>His mercury eyes dance with merriment. \u201cKidding. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>He walks over to me and stares at me through the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>I look at my reflection. I admit, I do feel like an inked and slightly unconventional version of Cinderella. My hair is a messy updo, with fuchsia tendrils swirling down toward my collarbone. My dress is pretty simple, A-line, antique white, with a layer of fine lace overlay, strapless, backless\u2014almost obscenely so. I turn in the mirror, inspecting my inked dragon that goes up my back and down my arm.</p> <p>\u201cI want to do just one thing before I put you on the back of Eli\u2019s bike and drive you to your wedding,\u201d he says, and turns me around to face him. He\u2019s wearing a black tux, just like Luc\u2019s and Phin\u2019s, complete with a fuchsia bow tie. So very handsome. With my white strappy heels on, I\u2019m just about eye to eye with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Gently, he takes my face in his hands, turns my head to the side, and presses his mouth against mine.</p><p>And kisses me. I kiss him back.</p><p>It\u2019s not a short kiss.</p><p>But it\u2019s not perverted and obscene, either. I\u2019m a little stunned.</p><p>And I\u2019ll never, ever forget it.</p><p>He pulls back, and his eyes are softened. He smiles. \u201cI will always love you, Riley,\u201d he admits. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll always regret the day Eli met you first. But . . .\u201d He pulls me into a hug. \u201cI am satisfied just loving you as a friend. And I will always, forever be here for you. No matter what.\u201d</p> <p>I smile, adjust a loose dread that has escaped the velvet tie at the nape of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest girl alive,\u201d I admit. \u201cTo have you, Eli, and so many others. I\u2019ll always love you, too, Noah. You\u2019ll always be more than a friend to me.\u201d</p><p>His mercury eyes sparkle. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be serious. And yes, I mean it, but not in a nasty, sex way. I do love you.\u201d I kiss him quickly on the lips. \u201cBut I can only be in love with one. And it\u2019s always been Eli.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile cracks his beautiful face in two. \u201cI know. And I know what you mean.\u201d He inclines his head toward the door. \u201cReady, gorgeous?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and ease it out. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>We head to the door, and he hands me my bouquet. \u201cI told Eli I was gonna do that, by the way.\u201d</p><p>I smile at him. My feelings are deep for Noah, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without him. We\u2019ve been through a lot. \u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Noah grins and holds the door open for me. \u201cLast chance.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, Noah hands me my shades, and I slip them on. I inhale a lungful of Savannah springtime air, hike up my dress, and let Noah help me onto the back of Eli\u2019s Martin Brother\u2019s Silverback. White silk streamers and tin cans are tied all over the back and fenders, and trail behind us as we ignore the helmet law and move through the streets of Savannah. I slide my arms around Noah\u2019s waist and hold on, and smile at the passersby on the sidewalks as we make our way to Forsythe Park. Azaleas and wisteria are in full bloom, and honestly, it couldn\u2019t be a more perfect day.</p><p>If only my mom could be here to see it.</p><p>We get to Forsythe. Noah pulls into a space, and parks. He helps me off and tucks my hand in the crook of his arm as we make our way to the fountain.</p><p>The invited crowd of loved ones is way too large for an indoor church wedding. Outdoors was the only way to go, and I\u2019d chosen the fountain because, well, it\u2019s beautiful, and my mom had always loved it. God, how I miss her on this day.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s watching you, love,\u201d Noah says in a quiet voice. \u201cShe sees.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Noah Miles is one sweet man. I pray he finds a woman one day who deserves him. Luckily, I\u2019ll be around long enough to ensure that. I pull him closer. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He walks me to a large moss-draped tree, where Preacher awaits me. His white smile nearly blinds me as Noah hands me to my surrogate grandfather.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see ya up there,\u201d Noah says with a wink, and disappears up the walk.</p><p>Preacher tucks my hand into his large ebony one. Callused, familiar, and loving. \u201cYou are a painted beauty, girl, dat\u2019s right,\u201d he says with love. \u201cMe and your grandmudder are so proud of you. Dat boy\u201d\u2014he inclines his head toward the front, where Eli awaits\u2014\u201che loves you in de same way I love Estelle. The forever kind.\u201d He gives a single nod. \u201cDat\u2019s all I want for my baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I say, my voice choked.</p><p>Preacher kisses me on the cheek. \u201cI know dat.\u201d</p><p>I suppress a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna take dem tings off your pretty face?\u201d</p><p>I slip off my shades and ease them into the pocket of Preacher\u2019s black tux. \u201cThanks,\u201d I say.</p><p>He grins and faces forward.</p><p>The music starts up.</p><p>It\u2019s not your conventional wedding.</p><p>Rhine, Tate, Gerry, and Pete are playing my wedding march.</p><p>Rhine wrote it himself. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard it.</p><p>It\u2019s nearly breaking my heart.</p><p>\u201cDat\u2019s a fine boy, too, dat Rhine,\u201d Preacher informs me quietly. \u201cGood boy. Nice voice, dat\u2019s right. Your grandmudder ordered his CD on Amazon. Plays it all da time, she does.\u201d</p><p>I look at my grandfather and laugh. Lord help the world, Estelle has discovered the Internet.</p><p>Through the crowd, I see Rhine with his bass, and I have to agree. He\u2019s a great guy.</p><p>Ahead, a small line starts to move toward the fountain, where Garr, also an ordained minister, awaits us. Noah is Eli\u2019s best man, and the pair stand at the fountain, on Garr\u2019s left. But Noah is standing in just the right position, so I don\u2019t have a good look at Eli yet. My insides ping with nerves. Ahead of me, Nyx and Luc make their way up an aisle covered in dogwood blooms. Guests are seated in white wooden folding chairs on either side of the fountain.</p><p>They\u2019re filled to the gills with people I love.</p><p>Next, Phin grasps his sister\u2019s arm and they head up the aisle. He returns for his mother, Elise, who is stunning in a champagne silk gown with a diamond choker. Gilles follows behind them. Luc returns and escorts Estelle down the aisle then, but not before she turns, her eyes wide, and a big grin stretches across her aged ebony face. She\u2019s wearing a soft light dove gray dress that shimmers in the sunlight. It reminds me of Noah\u2019s eyes. She\u2019s my beautiful Gullah grandmother, and she kisses me, then heads up the aisle.</p><p>I glance out over the crowd gathered before me, and I\u2019m in absolute awe of my life and all who is in it.</p><p>First, my baby brother, who sits on the front row. This whole thing started when he and his silly friends inadvertently set the Arcos brothers free of their graves. What would have happened if they hadn\u2019t done that?</p><p>I shudder at the thought.</p><p>All things happen for a reason. I\u2019m so totally convinced of that.</p><p>Next to my brother, of all souls, is Victorian Arcos. One of the entombed devils, who turned out not to be such a devil after all. He smiles at me, and I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s behaving so well. Not once since our last mind convo has he entered my thoughts. I think Eli must have had a talk with him.</p><p>Gabriel and Sydney are here, Lucien and Ginger. Jake Andorra, and he has a date, which makes me slightly curious. Victorian Arcos is next to Jake\u2019s date. My WUP family. Perfect. They\u2019d settled the wolf war in the Highlands, by the way.</p><p>And then all of my lovely Gullah family.</p><p>Jack and Tuba, Preacher\u2019s nephews, flanked by big Zetty the Tibetan, are nearly taking up a row all themselves. Preacher\u2019s family. Garr\u2019s family, and several of Noah\u2019s Charleston crew have gathered.</p><p>It\u2019s all pretty fantastic.</p><p>Werewoves. Gullah. Humans. Vampires.</p><p>And whatever Gabriel is.</p><p>I am not there, Riley, but I can see you. I\u2019m envious of Eli, and I\u2019ll always love you. I\u2019m here to watch over you. All you have to do is call me.</p><p>Thanks, Athios. Because of you, this is possible. I\u2019ll never forget it.</p><p>I\u2019ll never forget you, my love. And Miles is right, by the way. Your mother is here. She sees. Her happiness for you makes her light brighter.</p><p>Tell her I love and miss her so much, Athios.</p><p>She knows.</p><p>My eyes mist with tears. My mother\u2019s watching. Of course she\u2019s an angel. She was in life. Why would she be anything less in death? A joy fills me, and I know it\u2019s her.</p><p>Thank you, Athios. What do you know? My own guardian angel.</p><p>My eyes drift to the other side of the guests.</p><p>The side that is nearly taken up by the absolute largest men I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Tristan de Barre of Dreadmoor Keep, his wife and brood, along with Jason, Gawan, and Ellie, and all of their children, have crossed the Pond to attend the nups. Tristan\u2019s men have come as well, and let me tell you, it\u2019s an impressive bunch of once-medieval fellas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To think of all the lives that have been lived. Lost. Relived.</p><p>Shocks me to the core.</p><p>\u201cTime to go, baby girl,\u201d Preacher whispers to me.</p> <p>Rhine starts a new tune\u2014another he\u2019s written\u2014and Preacher and I start up the dogwood-petal-strewn aisle.</p><p>My eyes are fixed now on only one soul. My breath leaves me.</p><p>His eyes are mostly back to that beautiful cerulean color I love. But there are still flecks of red embedded in them that may never go away. I\u2019d decided that it\u2019s him, and I wanted all of him. No contacts needed. Our gazes are locked as I make my way toward him. The look on his face reveals much. Jaw muscle flexing, and he\u2019s fighting a smile, but soon loses that fight as his beautiful lips stretch into a wide grin.</p><p>I think he\u2019s freaked.</p><p>He meets me and Preacher in the front of the fountain. Preacher kisses me and places my hand in Eli\u2019s. Then he joins them together and sits beside his wife.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop shaking,\u201d Eli whispers in my ear as we face Garr.</p><p>My heart leaps.</p><p>Garr goes through the typical ceremony, and I hear every single word he says. Through sickness and in health. Yes, yes, of course. For as long as you both shall live? Is there any other choice? Longer than that, maybe? His words register, and Eli and I both answer. Inside, though, I\u2019m a quiver of nerves. My wedding day. To Eligius Dupr\u00e9.</p><p>How did I get so lucky?</p><p>\u201cYou wish to say your own vows, dat\u2019s right?\u201d Garr asks.</p><p>Eli nods and turns me to face him. He holds my hands and slips a platinum band over my ring finger. It nestles next to the engagement ring he\u2019d given me, before Edinburgh. It feels right, like it\u2019s belonged there all along, and my breath hitches. \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve waited for you, Riley Poe. You\u2019re everything I could ever want, no matter how many lifetimes we live. You make me full, complete, and I\u2019ll spend every single day making sure you never regret marrying me.\u201d</p> <p>My heart is in my throat, and I swallow past it. Eli\u2019s words sink to my core. Love makes my nerves tingle. My eyes meet his, and I hold his gaze. My heart flutters. \u201cI worked hard to pull out of the dregs that were once my life,\u201d I say, and I ease the wide platinum matching band over Eli\u2019s ring finger. My hands are shaking. The sun beams overhead but is filtered through the canopy of live oaks. Dapples of sun light on Eli\u2019s face, and just looking at him I feel my heart melting. His mouth lifts on one side, fighting a grin. \u201cBut to love you is the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019ll love you till the day I die, Eligius Dupr\u00e9. You\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. You\u2019re my life.\u201d</p><p>I hear Nyx sniffling behind me, and I fight my own tears.</p><p>\u201cWell, den,\u201d Garr says. He\u2019s dressed in a dark gray tux and a slick hat to match. \u201cI think you two belong togedder, forever. In the eyes of God, and all dese folk, I pronounce you wife and husband, for as long as you both exist.\u201d Garr grins at Eli. \u201cWell, den, kiss her, boy!\u201d</p><p>My whole body is humming with love and excitement as Eli grasps my face with both of his hands and presses his mouth to mine. It\u2019s a sweet, long, sleight-of-tongue kiss, and I melt into him. He pulls back and looks down at me, and the love in his mostly blue eyes takes my breath away. He smiles. I smile back.</p><p>You\u2019re mine, he says.</p><p>Nuh-uh, you\u2019re mine, I correct.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Eligius Dupr\u00e9, all hitched and legal!\u201d Garr hollers.</p><p>Someone in the crowd whistles, and I know without looking it\u2019s Tristan. The sound pierces the air and rivals that of a screeching falcon. The crowd roars then, clapping and rising to their feet. Eli takes my hand and we make our way right into the center of them all, and we stand there forever greeting, hugging, and rejoicing.</p> <p>\u201cMy God, woman,\u201d a deep voice rumbles at my ear. \u201cI thought you were a vision wearing a battle helm and yielding a broadsword.\u201d I turn and look up\u2014way up\u2014into the strange blue eyes of Tristan de Barre. \u201cBut I fancy this dress, for sure!\u201d</p><p>I throw my arms around Tristan, and for the first time, meet his lovely wife, Andi. In turn, I hug all of the Dragonhawk knights, Gawan of Conwyk and his wife, Ellie, and all of their children combined. It\u2019s like a small army. Eli shakes their hands, and they\u2019re none satisfied with that. They pull him, too, into a tight bear hug.</p><p>It\u2019s a day of hugging I\u2019ll not soon forget.</p><p>\u201cYou did well, gel,\u201d Gawan\u2019s strangely accented voice says in my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re a strong-willed lass\u2014that\u2019s for sure. No one else woulda survived that realm, save you.\u201d</p><p>I grasp his large hands in mine. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be here if it not for you, Gawan. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Gawan holds my gaze for a moment, and together we share a silent understanding. He nods, then joins his family.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d a familiar voice sounds off to my left. \u201cI guess this means you two need paid vacay.\u201d</p><p>I turn and throw my arms around Jake Andorra\u2019s neck, and he hugs me tightly. Then he slaps Eli on the back. \u201cGood to see you, Dupr\u00e9. You both look fitter than ever. Can you two wrap up your honeymoon so we can get back to work? I hear there\u2019re unexplained ghostly slayings in an Irish asylum. Could use your help.\u201d</p><p>Eli and I pass a look.</p><p>And grin.</p><p>Jake walks off, shaking his head.</p><p>We greet the WUP team, Ginger and Lucian, as well as Gabriel and Sydney, and I\u2019m thankful for all of the eclectic souls in my life.</p><p>Including the one I\u2019m now married to.</p><p>My brother hugs me close and kisses my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re the prettiest bride I\u2019ve ever seen, Ri,\u201d he says. Still the sweetest kid ever. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, bro,\u201d I tell him. I\u2019ll later let him know what Athios told me about our mother.</p><p>\u201cHow about me?\u201d</p><p>I turn and, without hesitation, throw my arms around Victorian Arcos. He\u2019s handsome, velvety black hair still pulled into a queue, and looking positively polished in an Armani tux. \u201cSlick threads,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I, you,\u201d he answers. Then sighs. \u201cI suppose this is the end?\u201d</p><p>I lift an eyebrow. Vic and I had spoken on the phone after he\u2019d settled things with his family. I owe him my life. He\u2019d sacrificed so much. I couldn\u2019t imagine, well, life without him. I smile. \u201cNever the end, my friend. But yes. I\u2019m married now. Your chances with me are officially over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected as much.\u201d</p><p>Eli laughs and claps Vic on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, old boy. You\u2019ll find someone. I\u2019ve no doubt.\u201d</p><p>No one like her.</p><p>I smile at Victorian for slipping that one past Eli, and kiss him on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cSo this is the lucky one,\u201d an accented voice says at my side. I turn and find Rhine grinning. He sticks his hand out to shake Eli\u2019s. \u201cI almost stole her from you, ya know.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s grin is genuine. \u201cAlmost,\u201d he says. \u201cThank you for watching after her. She\u2019s not stopped talking about you. Quite impressive.\u201d</p><p>Rhine leans over and brushes a kiss across my lips. \u201cAnytime,\u201d he says. His green eyes flash with mischief. He shakes his head and walks over to talk to his band.</p><p>\u201cSo, here we all are, full circle,\u201d Noah says. He drapes an arm over my shoulder. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>Eli grins and shoves Noah\u2019s arm off me. \u201cNow we honeymoon. For a long time. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and lay my head against his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re overwhelming, Miles,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like I have two husbands.\u201d</p><p>When I glance at Noah, his eyes are twinkling.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think it,\u201d Eli warns.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed me before we came here today,\u201d I tattle.</p><p>\u201cShe kissed me back,\u201d Noah adds.</p><p>\u201cBut I get to take her home,\u201d Eli says, looking down at me. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not now, silly boy,\u201d Eli\u2019s mother, Elise, says at his elbow. She kisses me and hugs her son. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a huge reception planned. You\u2019ve got to go to that first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Nyx says at my other side. Luc is beside her, and Phin won\u2019t stop staring at me, grinning. Their youngest sibling, Josie, is holding Seth\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHow long will you guys be gone?\u201d Josie asks me. \u201cI haven\u2019t hardly been able to catch up with you, Ri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I answer, then look at her brother.</p><p>My husband.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks, shorty,\u201d Eli tells his sister. \u201cThen I\u2019ll share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have your word on that?\u201d Phin asks, grinning. \u201cMy new sister here is supposed to ink me when you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhin\u2019s letting me design it, too,\u201d Josie says. \u201cWait till you see it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy new daughter,\u201d Gilles says, stepping close and hugging his wife. \u201cYou\u2019re simply stunning, ch\u00e8re.\u201d He lifts my hand and kisses it, and I\u2019m briefly reminded of the first time I met him. It brings a smile to my face. He grins in return. \u201cI\u2019m ever so glad to have you and Seth in our little family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d I say, smiling.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201d Seth cries. \u201cI\u2019m starving!\u201d</p><p>The whole party moves to the Dupr\u00e9 family home for a reception. Eli and I do all of the traditional things a wedding party does: cut the cake, sans squashing it in each other\u2019s faces; the toast. The throwing of the bouquet, and the flinging of the garter, which Phin catches with a grin. A photographer who\u2019s been taking pictures the whole time smiles to herself, apparently proud of her work.</p><p>I\u2019m just glad vampires really can be seen in photos.</p><p>Rhine and his band play, and we dance. We eat. We party. I share a dance with, God Almighty, everyone. Rhine, Noah, Victorian, Gabriel, Lucian, Jake, Tristan, Gawan. Jason, and every single one of the Dragonhawk knights. Gilles, Preacher, and Garr. By the time I\u2019ve danced with the last of my Gullah family, I am thinking I will pass out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luckily, Preacher had slipped me a little root doctor concoction before my wedding, to prevent me from falling out in a narcoleptic coma. Jesus, that would\u2019ve been a disaster. Me. Asleep. On my wedding night. As it is, I\u2019m wide awake. Anxious. Elated.</p><p>Filled to the rim with a joy I can\u2019t even begin to explain.</p><p>More hugging, more kissing, and more memories are made. I truly am a lucky girl.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t get out of here within the next five minutes I\u2019m going to maul you here in front of everyone,\u201d Eli whispers into my ear. I look at him, and his eyes shine. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>I grin.</p><p>I believe him. \u201cWell, let\u2019s go, Mr. Dupr\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Eli grins. \u201cAs you wish, Mrs. Dupr\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Yes. We\u2019re that annoying couple who relishes calling each other by their newly married name. I love it. I can\u2019t say it enough.</p> <p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Noah suddenly says at my shoulder. He grins down at me. \u201cI must love the hell out of you both. Assisting in your honeymoon getaway.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cWhat have I become?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best friend a man could ask for,\u201d Eli says, and hugs him. \u201cLead the way, my good man.\u201d</p><p>We weave through the back of the house, and outside, Eli\u2019s Silverback awaits. Cans and streamers sill hang behind it. Noah helps me onto the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of everything until you get back,\u201d he tells Eli. Then leans over and kisses me. \u201cI love you, Mrs. Dupr\u00e9. See ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, Mr. Miles.\u201d</p><p>Noah grins and waves us away.</p> <p>I hold on to Eli\u2019s waist, and I have absolutely no idea where we\u2019re going. He told no one\u2014except Rhine and the band, who\u2019d helped him get whatever he\u2019s gotten ready ready. He pulls the Silverback up to the landing on River Street and helps me off. Wordlessly, he takes me down to the dock and helps me onto a small boat. Without saying one word, he pulls me against him and starts the engine. We take off into the harbor.</p><p>A half hour later, and ahead, through the darkness, one of the small barrier islands is awash in moonlight. On the beach, a fire flickers. Eli runs the boat up onto the sand, jumps out, and lifts me up. He carries me to a lean-to, sits me on my feet.</p><p>Not any old run-of-the-mill lean-to.</p><p>Our wedding night lean-to. He steps through the gauzy white material of a doorway and looks back at me.</p><p>In his eyes shine possession, fierce longing, and something way deeper than I\u2019ve ever seen before in those blue depths. \u201cCome in here,\u201d he says, and grasps my hand, pulls me inside. I follow.</p><p>His eyes are trained on mine. \u201cStand still.\u201d</p><p>I do as he says.</p><p>Slowly, Eli\u2019s deft fingers move over my skin to the tiny buttons at the lower back of my gown. Loosening each one, he pushes my gown off my shoulders, his lips falling against my skin. My eyes close as his fingers trail down each hip, and he helps me step out of my dress. He removes my shoes. When he stands, I take off his tux jacket. Push his suspenders off his shoulders. Unbutton his shirt. When my hands move to his belt, air hisses from his lips. I slowly push his slacks over his muscular hips, and I\u2019m not surprised to see he\u2019s gone to his wedding commando-style. He grins, kicks off his socks and shoes, and scoops me up and lowers his head. Full lips brush over mine, and he kisses me until we reach the massive pallet of quilts thrown together for our wedding bed. He follows me down.</p> <p>My body involuntarily shakes.</p><p>He comes to me then, close; his body brushes mine, his fingers ease over my bare shoulders, across my collarbone, down the front where my strapless bra clasps between my breasts. He releases it, eases it down, and I wince. With a gentleness that no longer surprises me, he pushes the silky material off my body and drops it to the ground.</p><p>Inside, I\u2019m dying.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby,\u201d he says, reading my mind. He slips his fingers through the waistband of my panties and eases them off. \u201cI\u2019m going to fix that.\u201d</p><p>My heart leaps.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he whispers. I do.</p><p>Eli\u2019s mouth moves over my skin, tasting erotic samples of each rib, over my abdomen, each breast. I can feel the heat building inside me. It\u2019s been so long. I reach for him.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that,\u201d he whispers. \u201cStay with me, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>His seductive mouth against my skin makes my nerves leap. \u201cTry harder.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s hands glide over my shoulders, down my arms, intertwine his fingers with mine, and draw me close. His hard body presses close to me; his lips seek the top of my shoulder, my throat, my ear, my jaw, and slide to my mouth. In a slow, erotic kiss, his tongue grazes mine, his teeth scrape my lips and capture the bottom one, and he suckles gently.</p><p>Inside, I grow heavy with desire; my knees weaken, and I lift my hips; his breath catches in his throat; he captures my hands in his hands and lowers them.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, Riley,\u201d he says, his voice strained, his French accent thick. I move my hands to his chest, trail the muscles there, his breath brushing against my ear. \u201cYou touch me, I explode. Just . . . be still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t kiss me like that,\u201d I insist.</p><p>I feel his smile against my skin. \u201cNo promises there.\u201d</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he says against my cheek.</p><p>I do, and he pushes my hair over one shoulder and moves his mouth over my skin. It takes even more control not to touch Eli.</p><p>There\u2019s a hot, sexy, naked vampire in the marriage bed with me.</p><p>Eli chuckles, reading my thoughts. I think of nothing but Eli, his touch, and the craving he stirs within me. His hands glide over my body, every inch passed makes my eyes roll back in bliss; I want him everywhere, inside, out, and I never, ever want him to leave again.</p><p>His hands move over my hips, encircle my stomach, and pull my body against his. I feel his muscles pressing into my spine, his hardness pressing against the small of my back. His arms tighten around me, his mouth at my jaw. \u201cI swear, I\u2019ll never leave you again,\u201d he whispers, his voice strained, somewhat painful. \u201cI\u2019m yours forever.\u201d</p><p>I turn in his arms and lock my gaze on his. His dark hair falls across his eyes, and I reach up and push it aside, graze his jaw, run my thumb over his sexy lips. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>His mouth seeks mine. \u201cI promise,\u201d he whispers, his tongue tasting mine.</p><p>I push him back. \u201cGood. Now you be still.\u201d</p><p>A small smile tilts his mouth. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I lose myself in his drugging kiss; my hands glide over the muscles in his back, over his tight ass, over his hips. The feel of his tongue against mine, his teeth scraping my lips, makes me hot, wet, crazy. Blind with need, I move my hands over the cut ridges of his abdomen, lower, and grasp his hardness. He gasps in my mouth, groans deep, kisses me deeper.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Riley,\u201d he says, pained. \u201cControl\u2019s slipping.\u201d His hands are roaming all over me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d I mutter against his throat, my hands stroking him. \u201cNeed you,\u201d I pant, pressing my body to his. \u201cNow, Eli.\u201d</p><p>Without words, he moves over me, sinks his hard length in until Eli fills me completely. My head drops back, drugged, weightless. Eli\u2019s mouth tastes my skin; his tongue teases the hardened, sensitive peaks of my breasts, first one, then the other. With his fingers digging into my hips, he moves, the feel of his hardness sliding inside me making me crazy high. His mouth caresses me, makes love to me.</p><p>\u201cEli,\u201d I gasp, and hold on, our rhythms matching, and somewhere deep within me, an intense orgasm begins like a faraway storm. We move together, fast, out of control, until the storm grows in strength and finally crashes, wave after wave of climax claiming us both; I lose my breath, spasms rack my body. Eli holds me close; his mouth presses to my throat. The world tilts still; Eli\u2019s lovemaking has that effect on me. I can do nothing more than hold on to him.</p><p>Through the darkness, Eli\u2019s eyes search mine. Slowly, he lowers his head, captures my mouth, and kisses me. Now his control has returned and he uses it to savor my lips, my tongue, to speak to me with just his mouth: actions that speak volumes over any words he could have whispered to me.</p><p>Until he does.</p><p>Eli pulls me close against him, my head resting on his chest, his arms completely around me, holding me to his body. He pulls back, just enough so I can see his face. With his fingers, he finds my wedding ring. Caresses it.</p><p>Serious, cerulean eyes with tiny flecks of bloodred bore into mine. \u201cI love you, Riley Poe Dupr\u00e9.\u201d He brushes a thumb over my lips. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d die for you. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d He kisses me then, slowly, erotically, then looks at me again. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>I pull his mouth back to mine and kiss him until I\u2019m breathless. \u201cYou\u2019re mine forever, Eligius Dupr\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>He smiles against my mouth and pulls me closer. \u201cNot long enough, but it\u2019ll do for now.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
