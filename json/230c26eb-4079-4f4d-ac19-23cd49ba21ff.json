And if he\u2019d had any inkling of how hard he would fall, he would have had them shot for the lack of warning.</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe in love, in any of its stages: at first sight, over a series of dates, or people who\u2019d been friends for years suddenly snogging each other at the local pub.</p><p>Sebastian believed in facts, figures, and results.</p> <p>Fact: His annoying cousin, Alexander, was moping around, and kept calling him.</p><p>Fact: Sebastian had Alexander\u2019s calls blocked.</p><p>Fact: Alexander had resorted to popping up everywhere Sebastian had the unfortunate luck to be at the time.</p><p>Figures: This had been going on for six weeks, which was five and a half weeks too many.</p><p>Result: Sebastian had boarded a jet and flown to the States to collect a woman, in order to not to kill his cousin and land himself in jail.</p> <p>Or so he had convinced himself.</p><p>Never would he admit to anyone that this entire scheme was the result of the fact he actually owed it to his cousin to meddle in the poor bloke\u2019s relationship due to (also a fact) all the years Alexander had been forced to do his uncle\u2019s (and Sebastian\u2019s father) dirty work.</p><p>The soles of his shoes crunched on the salt and sand coating the formerly icy sidewalks of Holland Springs. Christmas decorations adorned nearly every storefront, bright red and green attracting the last minute shopper.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you Christian Romanov?\u201d a woman dared to ask.</p><p>Slicing his gaze her way, he raised a brow. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She tossed long blond hair over one shoulder, her brown eyes assessing. Knowing. The smell of freshly cut lawn, coconut, and sea breezes drifted to him. Summer. She smelled of summertime.</p> <p>\u201cBut you look just like him.\u201d She matched her stride to his, the heels of her boots tapping out a rhythm.</p><p>Jaw clenching, he bit out, \u201cCoincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>An escape route appeared and adrenaline flowed through him, but he kept his steps measured. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He made a sharp right. The echo of her boots went silent and he shoved his hands in his coat pocket, surveying the area. The little side street was blessedly devoid of people.</p><p>Exhaustion hit him hard, and he mulled over taking a breather on a convenient bench. Just as he leaned in the direction of resting for a minute or two hundred, tastefully twinkling white lights caught his eye.</p><p>Crossing the street, he felt the beginnings of a smile on his face when seasonally decorated cupcakes activated his sweet tooth. Pausing, he glanced up at the name, The Sweet Spot. Pink and brown dots surrounded the curly letters, underneath was a name, Daisy Barnes, and a phone number.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time for this. There was a woman to be found, a company to run into the ground, and a father to commit to the worst and slowest imaginable death possible.</p> <p>Really, what more could be expected of him during the holiday season?</p><p>Sugary candy canes placed in the center of cupcakes topped with green icing made him pause once more. All glittery red and white under a spotlight. Just sitting there, waiting to be eaten. He\u2019d never been one to deny his culinary cravings. There were very few things in life that he gave himself permission to enjoy. Sweets were at the top of his list.</p><p>\u201cOnly a quick pop-in and I\u2019m done,\u201d he muttered to himself. A few more steps and he pushed open the door. Bells jingled. Bing Crosby crooned in the background. Customers sat at tables with Menorahs, Christmas trees, and Kwanza candles as centerpieces, drinking and eating various desserts.</p><p>There was a line at the register, so he queued up for his turn. He shoved his hands into his coat pockets, palming his phone. Any minute now, he expected a text from his driver or one of his bodyguards for the location of Rose Holland.</p><p>He turned his attention towards the display of sweets, mentally sorting out the ones that he wanted to buy.</p><p>\u201cNow you know those \u00e9clairs aren\u2019t good for your diabetes. What will your wife think of you sneaking these?\u201d a melodic voice asked, her voice teasing. \u201cShe\u2019ll come in here and fuss at me for enabling you.\u201d</p><p>That was well done of her, Sebastian thought. It was good business to take care of one\u2019s customers.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want that to happen,\u201d the elderly gentleman in front of him said.</p><p>\u201cThen how about something healthier, like a pretzel, with some low-fat, sugar-free yogurt on the side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSound disgusting,\u201d the man said and Sebastian nodded in agreement. It sounded horrid.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yummy,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI tried it myself first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your taste buds are on the fritz,\u201d the man grumbled.</p><p>The woman laughed, full and hearty, and as melodic as her voice.</p><p>That laugh made him look up and over the man\u2019s shoulder. Had he known it would become the moment of moments, he would have turned around and never darkened this street or town again instead.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t know. So he looked. And what Sebastian saw made him freeze.</p><p>Forget moving\u2014he couldn\u2019t speak or even hear anything, his heart pounded too loudly in his ears.</p><p>She smiled, hazel eyes shining and orange hair bright under the lights.</p><p>Everything inside of him came alive. His palms were sweaty, his knees all weak, and he felt the earth move beneath him.</p><p>The man in front of him paid for his purchases and walked away. Now all of her attention was on him.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>A sort of croak emanated. From him.</p><p>Her smile fell as her head tilted to one side, and he was gutted. It was his mission to make her smile again. Finding Rose Holland was rapidly sinking to the bottom of his to-do list because of that smile.</p><p>That smile was beautiful, sweet, kind, and lovely, so very lovely. He was in love with that smile\u2014that face. Everything. Oh, holy hell and kill him now.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, and he blinked. Apparently, she felt nothing he did. She hadn\u2019t felt the connection or the earth tilt on its axis. It was just another day, another customer for her. \u201cWould you like for me to call your brother? I don\u2019t think he and Zoe have left town just yet.\u201d</p><p>That she knew exactly who he was made it worse. Heat rising to his face, he took a breath and drawled, \u201cNot necessary. However, may I speak to the owner?\u201d Hopefully, Daisy Barnes would take this woman\u2019s place and spare him any more embarrassment.</p><p>Lush lips twisted a little. \u201cI am the owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Daisy Barnes?\u201d he barked, accusation and disbelief in his tone. Oh, bloody great.</p><p>Those lips of hers flattened a little, and then her smile returned. No, not the same smile. This was a hurry-up-and-state-your-business-and-get-out smile.</p><p>His heart pinched and he fought the urge to rub his chest in that very spot.</p><p>\u201cFor the last twenty-four years I have been.\u201d She nodded a little, and then said, \u201cYou\u2019re Sebastian Romanov. We\u2019re practically related, you know.\u201d</p><p>Stupefied, he could only reply, \u201cWe are?\u201d in an even sharper tone. Shut it, he mentally told himself. He was totally mucking this up.</p><p>Daisy, bless her, kept her smile in place. \u201cYour brother married my first cousin. Zoe\u2019s dad is my uncle. That makes us cousins by marriage.\u201d</p><p>Cousins by marriage? \u201cIt most certainly does not,\u201d he snapped. No way in hell he wanted to be related to the woman who made him all sweaty, shaky, and gutted.</p><p>Hazel eyes widened, and her face paled a little in obvious embarrassment. \u201cWhat can I get you before you leave?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t blame her wanting him out of her store, and he couldn\u2019t help but admire how she stood up to him. He couldn\u2019t help but notice it only upped his love-struck state. There was no way he could stay here any longer, not in her shop at least.</p><p>So, he blurted the first thing that came to mind, \u201cI\u2019m looking for Rose Holland.\u201d</p><p>A dark brow lifted and she tucked a strand of orange hair behind her ear. \u201cHave you tried her store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot,\u201d he said. The hell he wasn\u2019t. No greater idiot had ever existed before him.</p><p>She crossed her slender arms over a rather ample chest, tantalizing him with a glimpse of lace and creamy swells of flesh, and then she frowned when she caught him noticing. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Yes, dear God, for this entire conversation to be over. \u201cYour best cupcake.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>A confident smile graced her lips. \u201cThey\u2019re all my best.\u201d</p><p>Cheeky, he thought, all bemused and bewitched. \u201cI\u2019ll take the lot\u2014all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll\u2014\u201d she glanced at her case, brows furrowing. \u201c\u2014thirty five?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d He lifted his chin, falling back on what he did best\u2014intimidate and hold at bay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only ridiculous every other Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday is Tuesday,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>She smiled wickedly, and he nearly swooned like a school girl at a One Direction concert.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>This most perfect of all women had to stop, because if she didn\u2019t, he\u2019d most likely end up on bent knee, proposing marriage and babies. Two things he\u2019d always told himself that he never wanted and never deserved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a dozen,\u201d he said, pulling his wallet out. He\u2019d simply pay for his purchases, leave, and eat his cupcakes in private while nursing his embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cWhat flavors?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering like a decent human being, he smacked his credit card on the counter and snapped, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bloody matter.\u201d</p><p>Taking a step back, she grabbed a container and marched to the display. He half expected her to toss each one in and shut the lid so hard that the cupcakes would be a smashed mess by the time he opened it again, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, she began to hum as she carefully selected and placed each cupcake in a green box, closing the lid carefully and tying a silver bow around it. Her head was bent as she worked, her back to him. He couldn\u2019t stop staring at the exposed nape of her neck. Her bright orange hair was caught up in a bun, two chopsticks\u2014one green and one red\u2014holding it in place.</p><p>While she worked so efficiently, oblivious to him, erotic thoughts appeared out of nowhere\u2014all over that smooth expanse of skin. Thoughts transformed into mental images of him kissing the nape of her neck, while he slowly moved inside of her. Of her hair, tumbling around her shoulders before sliding across his thighs while she put that lush mouth of hers on his body.</p><p>He swallowed, willing the images away and instead filled his head with to-do lists.</p><p>Fly to Holland Springs.</p><p>Search for Rose Holland.</p><p>Find Ms. Holland and convince her to fly to England for the holidays.</p><p>Daisy whirled around, placing the green box on the counter. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Come back to Holland Springs, find Daisy Barnes again, and convince her to fly anywhere with him.</p><p>Ha! Voicing that particular addition to his to-do list was not something he could afford. Ever. Not even if she were amenable to the idea. Most certainly, she would not be amenable due greatly in part to the top-notch conversation he\u2019d been having with her up to this point.</p><p>Honestly, the best thing he could do at this moment would be to cut his losses and leave.</p><p>\u201cMs. Barnes, I truly apologize for insulting you and taking up your time,\u201d he said, and then grabbed his credit card and the box of cupcakes. He gave Daisy a stiff nod, ignoring the most treacherous part of him that now beat out her name, and walked out of her shop.</p><p>Daisy stared after him, jaw on the floor. \u201cWhat in the world?\u201d she whispered. He\u2019d been unresponsive, rude, insulting, and then completely apologetic. There was no mistaking the look in his beautiful blue eyes.</p><p>Sebastian disappeared around the corner, green box under his arm.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t pay for anything,\u201d she said as reality hit her. She checked the register to make sure she wasn\u2019t mistaken. \u201cCheese and crackers! He didn\u2019t pay for a darn thing.\u201d</p><p>Hurrying around the counter, she shoved the door to her store open and ran up the sidewalk, cold December air finding its way through the thin cardigan she wore.</p><p>A hard body rammed into her or she rammed into it. Either way, she was falling, until a large hand jerked her up and steadied her.</p><p>\u201cMr. Romanov said to give you this.\u201d The enormous man held out a fifty-dollar bill.</p><p>She gaped at the money, and then at him. \u201cThat\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Romanov said keep the rest for your trouble.\u201d</p><p>Then the man, who had to be Sebastian\u2019s bodyguard, let her go, still holding out the money. She took it and slipped it in her back pocket. \u201cTell him thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she cried as he turned to go.</p><p>\u201cDa?\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips. \u201cWhy is Sebastian looking for Rose Holland?\u201d Please let him be here for something good, not to do something horrible to Rose, she thought, because she would have no choice but to tell the police or CIA.</p><p>A wide grin split the man\u2019s face. \u201cHe wants his cousin to stop pestering him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander Romanov.\u201d The man had a weird obsession with her cheesecakes, before he\u2019d left town suddenly. Rose was almost as bad. Anyone with eyes could see the two of them were sweet on each other.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does my friend Rose fit in with his plan?\u201d she said, stressing the word friend. A gust of wind made her shiver and she crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cMr. Romanov will take her to his cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake her-take her, or ask her to go?\u201d Her lips had to be turning blue. She was not a fan of the cold at all, but none of that mattered. She had to make sure Rose was safe. The poor girl had been through enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAsk,\u201d he said, staring at her with admiration or irritation, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>She stomped her feet, not out of exasperation, but rather to warm up. \u201cAnd if she says no, then what?\u201d</p><p>The man looked her over, making her feel about two feet tall with his size. \u201cWe leave, without her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromise,\u201d she asked, her teeth beginning to chatter.</p><p>\u201cYes, we promise. I\u2019m not a monster, Ms. Barnes,\u201d Sebastian said from behind her and she turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Ms. Holland doesn\u2019t want to go, then she and her daughter stay here, in Holland Springs,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She shivered again and his icy blue eyes narrowed. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get your arse inside, then I won\u2019t be held responsible for tossing you over my shoulder, without your permission, and hauling you to your store myself,\u201d he growled. \u201cThat I promise as well.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her chin, refusing to be intimidated by him. It wasn\u2019t like she was going to stand out here all day, just as long as she needed to. \u201cAll you need to promise is that you\u2019re not here to hurt Rose or her daughter.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed even more and his mouth thinned. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you promise if she says no, that you\u2019ll leave, without her?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head for a moment, then gazed back at her. \u201cIf you\u2019re so damned worried, I\u2019d be happy to ask her in front of you, in public. Perhaps right here on this corner.\u201d</p><p>Weighing his words in her mind, she thought of all the positives, of all the things she did know about him. He was a public figure, a viscount, not some underworld mob boss, and his twin brother lived in Holland Springs with her cousin. This wasn\u2019t some stranger, and he had no reason to lie to her.</p> <p>Plus, he\u2019d ended up paying for the cupcakes. Evil didn\u2019t pay full-price, and then some for cupcakes, did it?</p><p>\u201cYou promise to do that, then go through with it, and I won\u2019t call the cops on you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cOr the CIA,\u201d she added quickly.</p><p>He smiled, all the way to his eyes, and she felt something warm grow inside of her, finding its way around and making her all soft. Something that had never happened when she\u2019d been around his brother who was his twin, for goodness sake, so it couldn\u2019t be just his looks.</p><p>Although, his looks were very pleasing to her eye. Pale blond hair, all slicked back, crystal blue eyes, full lips and to-die-for cheekbones.</p><p>Then that gorgeous smile turned into a smirk and she stepped back. \u201cI promise,\u201d he said and took her hand. He shook it, like they\u2019d just conducted a business transaction, and let it go, but not before a thrill of something ran up her arm. \u201cOff you go before I make good on my promise to haul you back inside.\u201d</p><p>Just as she opened her mouth to protest, another gust of wind blew right through her sweater and jeans. Sebastian stood there, with his bodyguard, neither of them bothered at all by the sudden drop in temperature, which meant that neither of them would leave before she did.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, her teeth chattering. \u201cMerry Christmas to y\u2019all.\u201d</p> <p>She practically ran back to her store, and spent the next hour drinking hot chocolate while chatting with her customers, until they all left. Not quite convinced Rose was completely safe, Daisy stayed open later than usual to keep an eye on things.</p><p>At four-thirty Rose Holland, along with her daughter, walked inside Daisy\u2019s store and pop rocks began to zing around Daisy\u2019s stomach.</p><p>Rose asked for her usual while Daisy contemplated the best way to tell her Sebastian was looking for her. But she didn\u2019t want to make Rose worry, when she had nothing to worry about. And what if he\u2019d already left town? She'd look stupid for getting Rose all worked up over nothing. Plus, he\u2019d promised, and from what she knew of him, what she\u2019d read of him (yes, she was unabashedly nosy about Sebastian Romanov, the twin brother of her cousin\u2019s husband, and his title and his world and his, well, everything.) and what she\u2019d heard of him, his word was everything.</p><p>Still...she had to do something.</p><p>Mind churning, Daisy wiped down all her counters and tables, swept the floors, and turned her sign from open to closed. \u201cStay as long as you like,\u201d she said, then she shuffled to the back of her store, emptied the dustpan, and hung up the broom. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Daisy. Tell the woman.\u201d</p><p>The bell on her door rang and she heard Rose call out her good-bye.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap.\u201d Daisy turned sharply, slipping on the floor and falling. She caught herself on her hands. She scrambled to her feet, snagged her cell phone, and raced outside.</p><p>A black Mercedes idled by the curb. Rose stood at the corner, her back to Daisy, while Sebastian stood facing her, as the two of them talked.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d Sebastian clapped his hands and rubbed them together. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Daisy skidded to a halt, clutching her phone so hard that her knuckles hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she heard Rose ask.</p><p>Rose didn\u2019t sound afraid or coerced. She sounded excited. Daisy relaxed her grip on her phone and slid it into her back pocket.</p><p>He gently tweaked Rose\u2019s daughter on the nose and said, \u201cTo jolly old England, of course.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d worried for nothing. Sebastian had kept his word, like he said he would. Like she\u2019d known in her heart and brain he would.</p><p>He was not a monster.</p><p>His eyes met hers over Rose\u2019s head. Daisy smiled sheepishly at him. He simply stared at her, then turned his attention to the woman in his arms and guided her into the waiting car.</p><p>Suddenly, for some reason Daisy couldn\u2019t explain, she wished it was her in his arms.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>For the second time in a month, Sebastian stood just outside The Sweet Shop, contemplating the desserts in the display window, or so he told himself.</p><p>Actually, he wanted to see Daisy again.</p><p>Pushing open the door, he walked inside. The shop was empty. Daisy stood, with her back to him, humming while she worked behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said and she whirled around, her eyes widening.</p><p>That same feeling hit him again. His palms grew sweaty, his knees weak and the earth tilted on its axis. Oh hell. It hadn\u2019t been a fluke. \u201cWhat in the world are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She sounded less than pleased to see him, and he seriously considered cutting his losses and leaving. Again. \u201cI\u2019d like to order more cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cWill you pay before you walk out of my store this time?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid you help Rose and Alexander get back together?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey seem happy.\u201d He shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cAlexander\u2019s stop pestering me.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to one side. \u201cWhy was your cousin pestering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed it was because he was lonely and missed Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you miss him pestering you?\u201d</p><p>Yes. He pulled a face. \u201cYou really don\u2019t expect me to answer that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d She winked at him, and dusted off her hands, then moved to a nearby sink to wash them, returning with a smile. \u201cSo, how many do you want, Viscount?\u201d she asked, her full lips twitching. \u201cOne bwa-ha-ha, or two bwa-ha-ha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d Sebastian began, flustered. Daisy sighed, her face flushing a little. \u201cSorry, that wasn\u2019t very nice of me, and you probably have no idea what I\u2019m talking about. So, how about one on the house to make up for it?\u201d</p><p>Her apology sounded sincere, something he rarely encountered. So when it did make an appearance...\u201cHow about two...bwa-ha-ha?\u201d Things like that happened. Although a part of him wanted to say\u2014See, I can be humorous, too. As for her Sesame Street reference, his brother had guest starred on the show. Though Sebastian would never admit it, he had watched everything Christian had ever been in.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blinked, pretty eyes going round. \u201cTwo...it is.\u201d Licking her lips, she glanced down and picked out the two he\u2019d been coveting the most, then placed them on a green and silver plate. \u201cSomething to drink: coffee, hot chocolate, water, mil\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater.\u201d</p><p>She handed the plate to him. \u201cMost people want coffee or milk.\u201d</p><p>Biting into the Christmas confection sent thrills of pleasure streaking through his taste buds. \u201cNot most people,\u201d he said around the first cupcake. What did one need with coffee or milk? Neither, in his opinion, served to enhance the flavor. Give him a roomful of sweets and an unlimited supply of water.</p><p>The bells on the door rang.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but I have another customer.\u201d</p><p>He raised a questioning brow and concentrated on not dropping a crumb. Not only because he was fastidious by nature, but this manna from Heaven couldn\u2019t be wasted. When Daisy returned, he practically had his nose against the glass, searching for the next candidate.</p><p>\u201cBerry Lemon is a customer favorite,\u201d she said. \u201cOr Red Velvet Dream.\u201d The bells rang again. \u201cHold that thought, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, watching Daisy as she handed an older gentleman a white box tied up with a green and silver bow. The man waved good-bye, and then went on his way, paying no mind to Sebastian or the two rather large Russian bodyguards standing on each side of her door.</p><p>\u201cWhere were we?\u201d She smiled and he scooted closer to bask in the warmth of that smile. \u201cMake a decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like the two you recommended.\u201d</p><p>In no time at all, she\u2019d given him what he\u2019d wanted. He walked to the closest table and sat down, centering the plate in front of him. To his eternal surprise, she sat down at the table for two, directly across from him. She placed a glass of iced water beside his plate.</p><p>\u201cWho are you looking for this time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>You. \u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you up to something again?\u201d she finally asked, her gaze assessing. It felt as though she could see through him, as though she could see through the mask he constantly wore in public. Outside his inner circle, he wasn\u2019t exactly known for being the most gregarious bloke.</p><p>\u201cWorld domination,\u201d he said. Not a total lie.</p><p>Sighing, she placed her chin in her hand. \u201cCan\u2019t help you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sitting with me?\u201d he asked, and then wanted to kick himself.</p><p>\u201cI like people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>She dipped her head to hide a smile, but he\u2019d caught it and wanted her to do it again. \u201cYou kinda have a funny way of showing it.\u201d She glanced at the watch on her wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s almost lunch time. Can I fix you something, or...I know! Want to help me fix lunch? After the first of the year, I\u2019ll be offering cooking class. You can be my test subject.\u201d</p><p>If her cooking was anything like her sweets, he\u2019d never leave Holland Springs without her. \u201cExpanding your horizons?\u201d</p><p>Rising to her feet, she shrugged. \u201cThinking ahead. Can\u2019t ever tell what will happen in business.\u201d</p><p>Smart woman. \u201cWhat does helping you \u2018fix lunch\u2019 involve?\u201d he asked, standing and following her to the back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to take off your coat and put on an apron.\u201d Her hips swayed as she walked, enticing him to quicken his pace. \u201cMaybe even a hair net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hair net?\u201d He practically growled the question.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m teasing.\u201d</p><p>He stopped when she turned to face him, her breasts brushing his coat. Desire burned through him, making his clothes too tight and his skin scorching hot. \u201cAnd the apron?\u201d he asked, his voice deeper than usual to his ears.</p><p>Her full lips parted. He wanted to kiss her, to taste her lips and nibble at them. Sweet or tart, he had to know. Dipping his head, he closed his eyes and\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s non-negotiable,\u201d Daisy squeaked, sidestepping him, completely unable to stop looking at his gorgeous face.</p><p>His eyes opened, blue as the sky in winter. \u201cWasn\u2019t aware this was a contract in the making.\u201d</p><p>Heart pounding, lust raging, and knees wobbling, she fanned herself. \u201cIt\u2019s hot back here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She almost kissed him! Well, he almost kissed her, and she\u2019d almost let him. What in the world was she thinking?</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t take the heat...\u201d</p><p>Narrowing her eyes at him, she said, \u201cDid you just try to make another joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said, his gaze roaming around her kitchen. Assessing and weighing everything he found it seemed.</p><p>\u201cAre you allergic to anything, besides people and good manners?\u201d She almost smacked her hand over her mouth.</p><p>A smile quirked his lips. He unbuttoned his coat and shrugged out of it, hanging it on a hook beside hers. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your bodyguards?\u201d Two men stood like sentinels on either side of her front door. Whether they scared off any day-before-New-Year\u2019s-Eve customers remained to be seen.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be joining us.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing two aprons, she handed one to him and tied the other around her waist. What a contrast between the faded apron and fine suit he wore. Oh my mercy, she thought, he still had on his suit jacket. \u201cYou might want to take off that, too. Maybe roll up your sleeves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlan on getting down and dirty, darling?\u201d he asked in that accented voice of his, once again removing more clothes and bringing back the raging lust and wobbly knees.</p><p>She washed her hands and dried them. \u201cUh...no.\u201d That really wasn\u2019t a question he needed to be asking her, mostly because it should be a statement of fact. God help her if he ever took off all his clothes in front of her. She was liable to burst into flames and go all gooey inside, like a roasted marshmallow. \u201cWash your hands, too, please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wordlessly, she began sorting the supplies they would need. Something simple and hearty would be good. Maybe turkey with avocado slices. There was yesterday\u2019s chicken rice soup that could be reheated, enough remained of it for the two of them to share.</p><p>Sebastian moved closer, standing behind her. \u201cWhat shall I do first?\u201d</p><p>Grabbing a breast of turkey, she plopped it down in front of her. \u201cCut this into thick slices, please.\u201d</p> <p>His arms came around her, settling on each side of the cutting board. \u201cShow me how thick...please.\u201d He selected a knife from the stand and held it out to her.</p><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d Taking the knife, she sliced through the meat. Just as she began to set the knife down, his large hand covered hers.</p><p>\u201cAgain...please,\u201d he murmured in her ear. He had to stop with those pleases. Those pleases with that voice...a total recipe for her undoing. \u201cI want to make sure it\u2019s perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>Muscle memory kept her from totally losing her composure as his skin, hot and smooth, caressed hers. They moved together, the knife an extension of them. \u201cAlmost an inch thick, that way it\u2019s still juicy and tender when you bite into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d His lips brushed the lobe of her ear. \u201cAnd the avocado? I\u2019m rather afraid I need more guidance before tackling that on my own. Please.\u201d</p> <p>Could she hire him as permanent help? They could prepare everything like this, hand to hand, back to front, his voice in her ear and his mouth on her skin. Yeah, her lady parts were all for that.</p><p>Her lady parts were out of their mind.</p><p>Flexing her fingers under his, she dropped the knife. \u201cYou\u2019ll manage.\u201d She ducked under his arm and almost ran to the freezer. Nothing she needed was in there, except the cold air. A cold shower would be better, but she would work with what she had.</p><p>What a day this had turned into. She leaned against the door.</p><p>Four years to the day, her mother\u2019s passing still made her heart ache. Still served to remind her that she was alone. Then he had walked in again, all beautiful and cold. And practically giddy over her desserts this time</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but smile and tease him.</p> <p>Sometimes, there were people you met and BAM!\u2014instant connection (even if it did take a second meeting). Not love at first sight or this is my soul mate. Just...this person makes me feel something other than loneliness. Or sorry for myself. Based on what she\u2019d read about Sebastian on the internet, he was more alone than she was.</p><p>An estranged brother, an indifferent cousin, and a seriously evil father in the hospital. Not to mention his mother. However, Sebastian wasn\u2019t exactly a saint. He maneuvered, bought, and sold companies like they were part of a Monopoly set. Then there were the rumors of the Russian Mafia connection, and of his family\u2019s English title being bought from the rightful heirs.</p><p>Don\u2019t even get her started about all the women he\u2019d been rumored to have been with\u2014socialites, princesses, and models. All accused him of being scorching hot in the bedroom and cold as Antarctica everywhere else. His response to it all\u2014absolutely nothing. He neither denied nor confirmed.</p><p>It was almost gentlemanly.</p><p>She blinked. Maybe she should stop reading those gossip sites. Who knew if any of it was true?</p><p>\u201cAll done, Daisy,\u201d he called out. He sounded happy, maybe even a little proud, while she felt lower than low dwelling on his personal life. One he wasn\u2019t choosing to share with her or anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the soup.\u201d Hurrying to the refrigerator, she searched the second shelf and found the plastic container. Prying off the lid, she placed the container in the microwave, set the time, and pressed start.</p><p>Her thoughts drifted back to the scorching hot in the bedroom comments. Now that she could believe. She sighed. But really, she couldn\u2019t be too hard on herself for thinking about him like that. Going without sex for two months straight tended to make a woman a little grouchy. Oh, who was she kidding? She was horny as all get out and taking things into her own hands sucked.</p> <p>Tracing the collar of her cardigan, she let her mind go to all sorts of dirty places involving one viscount, a tub of warm chocolate, and her. She could spread it on his\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour thoughts,\u201d Sebastian said, appearing out of nowhere and making her jump.</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d Heat rising to her cheeks, she concentrated on the countdown currently underway and thanked God that only fifteen seconds remained. With ten seconds remaining, she looked up.</p><p>He edged closer. \u201cI brought my work with me.\u201d Holding out a plate filled with slices of cheese, bread, turkey, and avocado, he bit the side of his lip. \u201cSo...your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>I think I should strip you naked and have my way with you. The microwave dinged. \u201cUh...ah.\u201d She bent her head, studying the plate. \u201cGreat job.\u201d She meant it. He\u2019d cut almost every piece as thick as she had shown him. Looking up, she smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re very handy with a knife, practically a natural.\u201d</p><p>Something gleamed in his pale blue eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d He set the plate down. \u201cI\u2019ll get bowls for the soup, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go turn my sign to \u2018closed\u2019 while I bring everything else to the table where we were sitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your customers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s usually slow on the day leading to New Year\u2019s Eve for in-house customers. I doubt anyone\u2019s shopping for dessert right now. Besides, all my pick-up orders have already been, well, picked up.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head and headed to the front. She made quick work of gathering everything they needed and placed it on a large tray. As she entered the room, he waited for her by the table, her chair pulled out.</p><p>Just as she set the tray down, he leaned over and whispered, \u201cI got over my allergy of good manners.\u201d</p><p>She bit back a smile and sat down. \u201cI might have found mine again, too.\u201d</p><p>He piled a thick piece of bread with turkey, avocados, and cheese. A charming smile appeared on his face, making her stare at him in wonder. \u201cShall I call you Daisy instead of Ms. Barnes? I thought if are to break bread together\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreaking bread together? Aren\u2019t you old-fashioned?\u201d She wiggled her brows. \u201cI lik\u2014\u201d</p><p>That charming smile disappeared, replaced by nothing. Absolutely nothing. He didn\u2019t smile, he didn\u2019t do anything, but kept his handsome face blank. \u201cMy apologies. Lunch. I wanted us to be on a first name basis before we ate.\u201d It was then Daisy realized that she had embarrassed him.</p><p>She placed her hand over his. \u201cI was going to say that I liked the sound of breaking bread together, especially during this time of year. It\u2019s nice...Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, her explanation didn\u2019t work, because he ate the rest of his meal in silence. She stayed quiet as well, but she couldn\u2019t help but notice that his gaze kept straying to her display of desserts, of all things.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he stare at her boobs like a normal guy? She ate the last bite of her sandwich, washed it down with water, and then leaned back in her chair. \u201cGuess I better clean up and re-open my store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me.\u201d</p><p>Openly watching him as he cleared their dishes, she tried to think of something to say before he left. Something nice. Something friendly. Something\u2014</p><p>Sebastian beat her to the punch. \u201cMay I take your picture to remember this day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-okay.\u201d She stood, and then moved to stand in front of the tiny Christmas tree she\u2019d placed in the corner at the first of the month. Grabbing the Santa Hat from the top of the tree, she pulled it over her head. \u201cHow\u2019s this? It\u2019ll hide the I-was-out-of-my-mind orange.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, a corner of his mouth kicked up. \u201cVery enterprising.\u201d Holding up his phone, he snapped a couple of pictures.</p><p>She felt a little silly standing there, so she plopped the Santa hat on his head and giggled at the sight. He looked so serious with his suit, then so silly with the hat. She wasn\u2019t surprised he\u2019d put his jacket back on. His overcoat lay neatly over a nearby chair. \u201cMy turn to take a picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d he glanced up at the ceiling, \u201c\u2014is that mistletoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I put it in the corner so no one would feel obligated to kiss.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dropped to her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t feel obligated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d She inched closer, carefully placing her palms on his chest. Dear God, his chest. Even though the layers, it felt broad and muscular. \u201cOh my mercy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He dipped his head and this time when his eyes closed, she didn\u2019t pull away. She didn\u2019t speak, she didn\u2019t think. Instead, she rose on her toes, grabbed the lapels of his jacket, and kissed him. And kissed him some more.</p><p>\u201cSebastian,\u201d she murmured against his lips.</p><p>\u201cBastian,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI prefer Bastian, Daisy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastian,\u201d she whispered. A better name. Something a girl who was sweet on him would call him between kisses. Like she was doing now.</p><p>The kiss deepened, his hands threading in her hair, pulling at the chopsticks that held her bun in place. They hit the floor with a clatter, and then her back hit the wall.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>He slid his tongue inside, flicking it at vulnerable spots she didn\u2019t know existed. Or maybe they had and were waiting on him to find them.</p><p>Her hair fell, glides of silk over her sensitive skin. His fingers gently touched the sides of her neck. A sensuous path that had her thighs trembling.</p><p>Further down his fingers went, hands cupping her shoulders, skimming down her arms, dipping to her chest, and then covering her breasts.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>She sucked his tongue deeper and he squeezed, making her nipples hard and wanting. Hooking a leg around his waist, she jerked him against her, the delicious weight of him making her moan into his mouth. His hand found her thigh, gripping it tight as she ground against him.</p><p>Suddenly, he pulled away, his pale eyes unfocused, and then sharpening to their normal frost. \u201cChrist,\u201d he swore. \u201cI hadn\u2019t intended for this to happen.\u201d His grip eased and she lowered her leg. She let go of his lapels as he let go of her breast.</p><p>A smile threatened to curve her lips, but she didn\u2019t want to give him the wrong impression. She didn\u2019t want him to think she was laughing at him. Instead, she stroked the side of his cheek. His jaw clenched and she did it again, wanting to ease his tension.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t apologize,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d His chin tipped up, full lips thinning. He held up his cell phone. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>Cold washed over and through her. There was no reason she should be embarrassed, but she was. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>He strode to the chair and shrugged into his overcoat, then cast a look at her over his shoulder. \u201cDamn it,\u201d he muttered and started for her again, long strides eating up the distance.</p><p>Heart swelling and desire rising, she met him halfway and wrapped her arms around his neck. Words weren\u2019t needed in this moment.</p><p>His hands settled on the sides of her face. \u201cDaisy.\u201d A statement or a question, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>She blinked up at him, this time allowing herself to smile at him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>For a minute, his mask slipped and longing shone in his eyes. \u201cHappy New Year\u2019s in advanced, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year\u2019s, Bastian.\u201d She licked her dry lips. \u201cI hope you find whatever it is you\u2019re looking for while you\u2019re here.\u201d I hope you come back to my store tomorrow, because I\u2019ll be waiting.</p><p>He searched her face, as if weighing her words for sincerity. \u201cI already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his head to hers, he breathed deeply and then pressed a kiss to her forehead. \u201cThank you, darling.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed. He held her or rather she held him, their bodies pressed tight once more,so tight that she actually felt his cell phone vibrate against her stomach.</p><p>Finally, she opened her eyes and looked up at him. Pale blue greeted her. He smiled. An honest-to-goodness smile. His cell phone vibrated again. Her amazing response, \u201cDon\u2019t you need to answer that?\u201d</p><p>The mask returned, hard and cold, and she wanted to kick herself. Why couldn\u2019t she have kept her mouth shut and enjoyed the moment?</p><p>His hands dropped and he fished his cell phone out of his pocket, reading the screen. Without another word, he pivoted and walked out her front door. Enormous, burly bodyguards followed close behind, their matching black coats swirling around them as they disappeared from her sight.</p><p>\u201cOh my mercy,\u201d she whispered, legs going shaky as she stumbled to a chair and plopped down in it.</p><p>Her door jerked open again. Sebastian was back. Her heart jumped up and down in her chest as he drew closer. Wordlessly, he held out his hand and she took it.</p><p>He pulled her to him and said, \u201cIf I could spend New Year\u2019s with you, I would. I want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you?\u201d she asked, her knees shaking. This wasn\u2019t what she expected him to say. Honestly, she didn\u2019t know what she expected him to say.</p><p>He dipped his head, forehead resting on hers. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t deserve to.\u201d Then he kissed her. Softly. Sweetly\u2014so achingly sweet. Breaking their kiss, he turned away from her and left, for good this time, leaving her standing there, staring at empty space.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Music blared, lights danced, and the drinks flowed freely at Poor Boys, Holland Springs most popular (and only) country music bar.</p><p>Daisy sat with her two closest friends, Haven Crawford and Isabella Edwards, at a high table, waiting on another round of drinks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFound anyone yet?\u201d Haven asked. She twirled a long lock of pink hair around her finger.</p><p>Isabella made a face. \u201cYou really expect us to go through with it?\u201d</p><p>Haven snorted. \u201cEither it\u2019s one of these jokers or each other.\u201d</p> <p>Daisy raised a hand. \u201cI vote each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on! It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve. We have to find someone to kiss,\u201d Haven said. \u201cIt\u2019s a like a rule.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, the image of Sebastian Romanov filled her head, all tall and lean, with his serious eyes and sexy mouth.</p><p>\u201cOooh, who are you thinking about, Daisy?\u201d Isabella asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, no one.\u201d She\u2019d never told her friends about that really strange encounter with Sebastian. Or the fact she\u2019d had dreams about the man. Erotic dreams that involved him, her, and a bowl of warm chocolate.</p> <p>\u201cSure you\u2019re not,\u201d Haven said with a little laugh.</p><p>Searching for a way out of revealing all, Daisy grinned as a familiar face caught her attention. She waved enthusiastically at her cousin, Heath Ambrose. He waved back, and then ambled up to the bar.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about you instead, Haven. Heath could be the one kissing you at\u2014\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head, her silver eyes narrowing. \u201cNot happening. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Isabella placed a comforting hand over Haven\u2019s. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t bother me if you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Haven. Bella and Heath never dated. They kissed once, like in tenth grade or something. So, you\u2019re in the clear,\u201d Daisy pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Isabella said. \u201cAnd since I actually have date tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hasn\u2019t bothered to show up.\u201d Haven tapped her phone\u2019s screen. \u201cHe\u2019s got fifteen minutes, lady.\u201d</p><p>Isabella made a tsking noise. \u201cStop trying to change the subject. Besides, Peter\u2019s on his way. He\u2019ll be here in five minutes. So...\u201d</p><p>The waitress dropped off their drinks, and Daisy picked up her bottle of beer, tipping it in Haven\u2019s direction. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s just you and me, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>But Haven wasn\u2019t paying her any mind. She was too busy burning holes in the back of Heath\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\u201cGo ask him,\u201d Daisy said, giving her friend\u2019s shoulder a little shove. \u201cYou know you want to.\u201d She motioned for Heath to come to their table.</p><p>Heath raised a glass in their direction and they all raised theirs right back. Well, everyone but Haven raised their glass. She turned up her nose and rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe has such an ego,\u201d she griped as Heath started in their direction.</p> <p>Daisy and Isabella exchanged glances, and then they both said, \u201cHello pot.\u201d</p><p>Haven made a face, huffing as Heath joined him. \u201cDon\u2019t you have other things to do, like knitting a brain for the empty space between your ears?\u201d</p><p>Heath smiled, slow and easy. \u201cKnitting club\u2019s on Wednesday nights, after church service. You interested in coming, baby doll?\u201d</p><p>Haven flicked her eyes over him. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019m interested in.\u201d Then she stood, grabbed her phone, and walked away.</p><p>Heath sucked in some air through his teeth. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>Isabella gave him a sympathetic smile. \u201cYou know you shouldn\u2019t have called her baby doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know it.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut I figured I\u2019d give her an actual reason to be rude to me.\u201d</p><p>Daisy had no idea why Haven had a problem with Heath. Heath was a down-to-earth, nice guy, and she wasn\u2019t just saying that because he was her cousin. He hadn\u2019t let his fame as a major league catcher go to his head. Every chance he got, he came home and helped his parents on their farm. He volunteered at the Boys and Girls Club, funded a camp for kids whose parents couldn\u2019t afford to send them, and a whole bunch of other projects.</p><p>Thing was\u2014Heath was like that growing up too. Sure, he\u2019d been a little cocky at times about his abilities, but Haven could hardly complain about that. The woman was practically a genius, who had no problem showing off her intelligence to anyone and everyone. She had been class valedictorian and had graduated from Duke with a degree in economics. Yet she had chosen to come home to run her grandparents\u2019 Bed and Breakfast when their failing health had prevented them from keeping it up properly.</p><p>Not something anyone had expected from the girl who\u2019d proclaimed Holland Springs wasn\u2019t big enough for her. Maybe being around Heath forced Haven to eat crow, more often than she already did.</p><p>\u201cEight minutes to kissy face time,\u201d Isabella announced, her face lighting up as her fianc\u00e9, Peter, joined them. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Peter leaned down to kiss her friend on the forehead, and then he flashed a smile at Heath. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little young to be out past eleven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in bed, old man?\u201d Heath asked, with a shit-eating grin.</p><p>\u201cOnly if Isabella is with me,\u201d Peter said. He held out his hand to Isabella. She took it, kissing Daisy on the cheek before she stood.</p><p>Heath\u2019s jaw clenched and he muttered something intelligible under his breath. Maybe Heath wasn\u2019t over Isabella like she\u2019d thought he was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be alone at midnight,\u201d her friend called out as she and her fianc\u00e9 disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>Daisy nodded and then sighed thickly. \u201cAwesome. I\u2019m stuck with my cousin, on New Year\u2019s Eve, and the ball\u2019s getting ready to drop.\u201d</p><p>Heath punched her lightly on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. We can toast and hug, but I think someone else might want to get in on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Daisy\u2019s brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey,\u201d a man said from behind.</p><p>\u201cGlen,\u201d she squeaked, turning around in her chair. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure if she were happy or sad about seeing him. They\u2019d broken up right after Thanksgiving, and the only time they talked was to arrange for their dog, Cici, to have visitation.</p><p>Heath grabbed his bottle of beer. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as my cue to leave.\u201d</p><p>Daisy managed a faint good-bye. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like coming to places like this.\u201d</p><p>Glen leaned down, his chocolate eyes all seductive. \u201cIt\u2019s taken me some time, but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that wherever you are, is where I want to be. Even\u2014\u201d he made a face of disgust and she recoiled a little, \u201cplaces like this. Besides, it\u2019s not like you come here that often.\u201d Actually she did. She, Haven, and Isabella had a weekly girls\u2019 night out here, but apparently, that had escaped Glen\u2019s notice.</p><p>\u201cI think we owe it to ourselves to give our relationship one more try,\u201d he added.</p><p>She looked at him skeptically, and he took her hand, kissing it softly. \u201cI missed you, Daisy. Haven\u2019t you missed me at all?\u201d</p><p>Actually, she had. No matter his faults, she\u2019d genuinely missed him. He\u2019d been one of her best friends growing up, and she didn\u2019t want to let go of that.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me another chance, honey. It\u2019s almost a new year. Let me show you the new me.\u201d</p><p>Caving, she stood and let Glen wrap his arms around her as the crowd began the final countdown. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he lowered his mouth to hers right as the bar went crazy.</p><p>The smell of bacon frying woke Daisy. She sat up in bed and glanced around, just as Glen, wearing nothing but a pair of boxer briefs, walked into the room. He smiled at her, and her stomach dropped.</p><p>All at once, everything came back to her: the kiss, her drinking waaay more than she should have, the drive to her house, their clothes all tangled around them, his hands on her breasts, and the room spinning...then nothing.</p><p>\u201cDid we spend the night together?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean, did we have sex?\u201d</p><p>He sat down beside her on the bed, taking her hand in his. \u201cWell, one of us did.\u201d He traced her lips with a finger. \u201cI\u2019ve missed these lips, and what they can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...I\u2014you...were the only one\u2014\u201d</p><p>Letting go of her hand, he held his own up. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not turning down a blow job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t return the favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell asleep,\u201d he said and her stomach roiled. He\u2019d used her and she\u2019d let him. \u201cDon\u2019t pout. I guess I could return the favor now.\u201d</p><p>Warning bells sounded in her head at the words guess and favor. Loving one another this way shouldn\u2019t be about favors. It should be mutual. \u201cWay to make me feel all special, Glen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to make you feel special.\u201d</p><p>Her reply died on her lips when he pushed her back on the bed and tore the sheet away. Who was this guy? Glen had always been a weird mix of timid and always-on-top missionary-style type of guy. Or maybe she didn\u2019t inspire no-holds-barred sex. Maybe all that came to mind with her was quiet, reasonable, and placid sex. Nothing to share with your girlfriends or have to take a couple of aspirin in the morning, because you were amazingly sore from the attention.</p><p>Apparently, only Haven had nights like that. Isabella was saving herself for marriage. So that left Daisy firmly in the middle and firmly on the boring side.</p><p>Gah.</p><p>His kissed a path down her stomach, ever closer to where she began to throb, and all feelings of unease and self-doubt began to dissolve like sugar in hot tea.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never wanted to do this before,\u201d she said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cFirst time for everything,\u201d he said, breath hot against her hipbone.</p><p>The timer dinged.</p><p>He shot up from bed and she sputtered a protest, \u201cNo\u2014wait...where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cinnamon rolls. I have to get them, or they\u2019ll burn.\u201d He kissed her on the forehead and looked into her eyes. She could have sworn she saw relief in them, but maybe that was just her own insecurities. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad. I made breakfast for you.\u201d He practically ran from the room.</p><p>Anticipation turned to ash.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have something else right now,\u201d she called after him, grabbing a pillowcase and biting it. This was dumb. She never should have let him come home with her. She should have stayed the hell away and taken Haven\u2019s advice by finding a guy to kiss at midnight who wasn\u2019t her ex. She tossed the defenseless pillow to the side.</p><p>But she was weak. And he was Glen. Her first everything.</p><p>A few minutes later, Glen walked into her bedroom again. This time he had a tray, loaded with plates and glasses of orange juice and water. A small rose bloom sat in a vase. It was nice he remembered she loved roses.</p><p>He set it across her lap and smiled like a little kid who\u2019d finally tied his shoes all by himself. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She picked up a fork and looked at her plate.</p><p>\u201cEggs over-easy and bacon extra crisp, just like you like it.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. She didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him that the eggs weren\u2019t done at all, or that the bacon was burnt. This was the first time he\u2019d ever attempted to cook for her, and for someone who cooked for others all the time, it was the sweetest thing ever.</p><p>\u201cThanks for fixing me breakfast.\u201d She leaned over and kissed him. No matter what, she\u2019d choke down the bacon, and she could swallow the eggs whole, without actually having to taste them.</p><p>\u201cI know last night happened a bit fast for us, but it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know each other.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she said noncommittally. \u201cVery true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe timing\u2019s perfect though, with my lease running out.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cYour lease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. So, when do you want me to move in, roomie?\u201d Glen asked as she took her first bite of eggs.</p><p>Daisy gave him a faint smile, chewing slowly and carefully. If she thought really hard, she could vaguely remember a conversation about his lease being up and needing a place to stay.</p><p>\u201cTake your time. I don\u2019t have to be out of my apartment until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>This time she dropped her fork.</p><p>Flowers. He could send flowers.</p><p>Sebastian shook his head. \u201cToo overdone.\u201d</p><p>He clicked on the Bulgari website, searching their inventory of bracelets, rings and\u2014ah, ha!\u2014chopsticks. They were made of jade, decorated with platinum filigree and diamond accents. Perfect for her hair. The green would contrast nicely against the bright orange.</p><p>\u201cExclusively made for Bulgari by Sam Max. One pair only. Call for details.\u201d He twisted his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d Just as he picked up the phone to call, the door to his study opened and his cousin walked in.</p><p>\u201cBad time?\u201d Alexander Romanov asked. As usual, his clothes were the very latest trend. At times Sebastian thought it a little much, but his version of being trendy was wearing a plaid tie instead of a striped one.</p><p>Closing his laptop and setting his phone down, Sebastian blew out an annoyed breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d Alexander sat down in the nearest club chair and crossed a leg over his ankle. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could we possibly have to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d Alexander said cheerfully. \u201cRose was the one to tell me to come here in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian leaned back in his office chair, steepling his hands together. \u201cAnd you did as you were bid.\u201d</p><p>Alexander shrugged. \u201cI rather fancy having Rose and our daughter in my life.\u201d</p><p>Trust Alexander not to be put out in the least by his insult. Very few things could ruffle the man, and try as he might, Sebastian wasn\u2019t one of them. However, that didn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t stop trying to get under his cousin\u2019s skin. \u201cObviously you\u2019ve come to thank me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is that.\u201d A smile played on Alexander\u2019s lips. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m grateful for the lie you told to get her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let her to believe you were Christian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was the only way,\u201d Sebastian said lightly. I\u2019m not a monster. The words echoed in his mind. All lies, he\u2019d told Daisy. Truth be told\u2014he would have kidnapped the woman and her daughter, in order to bring them here. But he\u2019d made a promise to a certain baker, and despite the monster that lived inside of him, his word was everything.</p><p>Alexander gave him a skeptical look. \u201cIt would have been easier for you to have sent someone to Rose\u2019s place, and encouraged her to come here.\u201d</p><p>They both knew what encouraged meant, and it wasn\u2019t the definition one would see in Webster\u2019s Dictionary. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ve decided to turn over a new leaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the Queen will step aside and let Prince Charles rule.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian forced his hands to his lap. No need to let his cousin see him agitated. The man wouldn\u2019t stop if he did. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p> <p>His cousin rose to his feet, seemed to think the better of it, and sat down again. \u201cOut with it.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian pressed the tips of his fingers against mouth. Maybe Alexander could give him a little insider knowledge about Daisy, without Sebastian ever having to admit who he needed insider information about.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this woman,\u201d Sebastian began.</p><p>A smile kicked up the corners of Alexander\u2019s mouth. \u201cIsn\u2019t there always?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian flattened his lips. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind...\u201d</p><p>Alexander waved a hand. \u201cGo on, go on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis woman...let\u2019s call her Petunia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. That\u2019s a dreadful name. Might as well name the woman Shrub.\u201d</p><p>Suppressing an eye roll, Sebastian continued, \u201cAnyway, Petunia lives in Holland Springs, and I should like to send her something. Flowers are out of the question\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Alexander snorted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid jewelry might be a little too much, too soon.\u201d He\u2019d buy the chopsticks anyway and save them for later. \u201cMaybe chocolates or the like...wasn\u2019t there some confectionary shop that you couldn\u2019t stop going on about when you were moping over Rose?\u201d</p><p>His cousin\u2019s green eyes fixed on him, and Sebastian knew a moment of dread. \u201cThe Sweet Spot. Daisy Barnes owns it. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought it best to shop local, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought it best to know about the owner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne can\u2019t do business with just anyone,\u201d Sebastian agreed. This would be easier than he thought.</p><p>\u201cEspecially when you\u2019re attracted to said owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Alexander smirked and raised his brows.</p><p>Dammit. \u201cNo. I...ah.\u201d Sebastian clamped his mouth shut. No way around it. He\u2019d been caught.</p><p>His cousin leaned forward. \u201cLet me help you out, mate. You met the beauteous Daisy, and yes, I noticed\u2014I am a man\u2014and it was like lightning struck the poor sod otherwise known as Sebastian Romanov. The earth moved and yet, your Daisy felt nothing. You responded in the usual way, with arrogant comebacks and demands, completely ruining any chance of ever wooing said lady.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian stared at him in horror. \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with spies,\u201d Alexander said, smirk still firmly in place. \u201cOr the ability to remotely activate mobile phones whenever the mood strikes and listen in. Never know what one might hear. And you\u2019re you, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I want to know more about Daisy Barnes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, Sebastian,\u201d Alexander crooned, as if he were talking to his daughter and not a grown man of twenty-six. \u201cNow the rest, or I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. Sebastian crossed him arms and then smiled. \u201cI\u2019m in love with Daisy Barnes.\u201d</p><p>Alexander blinked and his mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019re sure Daisy Barnes isn\u2019t a metaphor for money or her business that you want to buy and turn into some kind of cupcake empire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m truly sorry to say your Daisy belongs to another.\u201d</p><p>The world that had shifted under his feet blew itself to pieces. \u201cShe\u2019s married?\u201d He didn\u2019t recall seeing a ring, but maybe in her line of work, rings were a hazard.</p><p>\u201cNo. Back with her ex. According to Rose, Glen moved in with Daisy a couple weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>So this was what heartbreak felt like. He rubbed at the spot in the center of his chest. \u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>This time Alexander stood and moved to the door. \u201cNormally I\u2019d give you hell, but it looks like you\u2019re already there.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian could only nod his head and stare, at nothing really. His cousin and the contents of the room had all become vague shapes.</p><p>\u201cBest thing about Daisy Barnes is her friendly nature. I ordered a few cheesecakes online from her last week, and we\u2014including Rose\u2014managed to exchange emails, which is how she found out about the ex.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Sebastian wanted to hear about was cheesecakes and Alexander\u2019s email exchanges with Daisy\u2014his vision sharpened, and he fixed his gaze on his cousin. \u201cShe personally responds to emails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did for us.\u201d Alexander stroked his chin. \u201cYou know, I was never a fan of getting back together with an ex, because usually there\u2019s a reason why an ex is your ex in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve shown you the open window, mate. Send an email through it.\u201d With that, his cousin strode out the door.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cOne cupcake again, Jules?\u201d Daisy stared at the order for a moment, then rechecked the on-line form. One red velvet cupcake to be sent to a Mr. Jules Westmoreland in Surrey, England. One cupcake a week. Just like every order he\u2019d made for the last three months. This was getting ridiculous, not to mention she felt guilty as heck that she\u2019d let it go on as long as she had.</p><p>She tapped out a tune on her keyboard with the tips of her fingers.</p><p>So far, she\u2019d shipped each one via FedEx per his request at the tune of over a hundred and fifty bucks just for shipping. It would be cheaper for him if he\u2019d just order all four at once, and she really should let Jules know.</p><p>Brow scrunching, she began to type:</p><p>Dear Jules,</p><p>How is your dad doing? Has he stopped being a difficult patient yet? When my mother was convalescing at home, there were days I wanted to pull my hair out, because she was so darn stubborn and didn\u2019t want my help. If you have to, leave the room for a minute, or hire someone to help him.</p><p>Be strong!</p><p>I also wanted to let you know that you could save a lot of money by ordering and having me ship all four cupcakes (baked however you want and whatever flavor icing you want) at once. Please don\u2019t mistake my email as a complaint\u2014I truly want to do what\u2019s best for my customers (and my friends, no matter how recently made) and that includes pointing out where they could save some money.</p><p>Let me know if you\u2019d like to change your order.</p><p>Smiles,</p><p>Daisy</p><p>Mr. Westmoreland\u2019s response came faster than she expected. Heck, it was almost nine at night and there was a five-hour time difference.</p><p>Daisy,</p><p>He remains the same\u2014arrogant, bad-tempered and non-cooperative\u2014and that\u2019s on his good days. Thanks for asking.</p><p>How goes negotiations with the insurance company? Still insisting the procedures weren\u2019t covered?</p><p>I rather like the arrangement we have, but if you feel it would be best to change, I suppose I could order four a week (and run the ten extra miles it would require to eat them).</p><p>Make it so.</p><p>Your servant,</p><p>Jules</p><p>She let her head fall against her palm. That\u2019s not what she meant at all. And had he really just quote Captain Picard from Star Trek? She laughed.</p><p>J.</p><p>Let me know how everything works out. You know you can email me anytime if you need to!</p><p>Ugh. Not going there with the insurance. At this rate, I\u2019ll have to sell the house and move in with my best friend, then Glen and I\u2019ll never be able to afford to get married. :}</p><p>BTW, I didn\u2019t mean you had to order four cupcakes every week, you goose! I meant you could order all four at the beginning of the month, and I would mail all of them to you at the same time, then all you would have to do is follow my instructions for keeping them fresh.</p><p>So sorry for the misunderstanding. I apologize.</p><p>Ten points deducted from Hufflepuff.</p><p>D.</p><p>Daisy,</p><p>Clearly, our email exchanges aren\u2019t quite getting our points across.</p><p>May I invite you to chat? We\u2019re using the same email provider.</p><p>Jules</p><p>Her stomach flipped. She sat back against her bed, her laptop sliding to one side before she righted it, and took a deep breath. What was the harm? They\u2019d been emailing back and forth for months now about personal stuff.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Jules: Daisy?</p><p>Daisy: I\u2019m here. Look, I feel really bad that you only order one cupcake at a time and pay so much for shipping, when you could order four at once, maybe at the beginning of the month, and I could ship with directions on how to keep them fresh.</p><p>Jules: You are lovely to think of me like this, but you lose absolutely no money with the arrangement we have.</p><p>Daisy: True, but I can\u2019t, in good conscience, let you keep doing that without knowing all your options. And I feel guilty that I hadn\u2019t thought of it before now. \uf04c</p><p>Jules: Again, you are a lovely person to think so, but I\u2019d be rather sad if I didn\u2019t receive my weekly update from you regarding my order and my well-being, my father\u2019s well-being, what episode of Downton Abbey I\u2019m up to now, or debate the merits of a female Dr. Who. However, if you feel it\u2019s for the best, we can only exchange emails once a month.</p><p>If she and Jules condensed their exchanges to once a month, it wouldn\u2019t be that much of... Suddenly, she got a funny feeling in her stomach.</p><p>She would miss talking to Jules each week, she realized.</p><p>Ridiculous, maybe, but true. Sometimes it seemed like she talked to Jules more than she did Glen, but then, Jules listened to her. Glen mostly grunted and crashed, claiming he was tired.</p><p>Jules: Daisy...? I apologize if I\u2019ve overstepped.</p><p>Daisy: NO! We can change your order to save money, but, um, we can still talk each week, if you want.</p><p>Jules: I\u2019d like that. And Daisy...</p><p>Daisy: Yes?</p><p>Jules: You have no idea how much your weekly emails (and cupcakes) have helped. Thank you.</p><p>Warmth spread through her, down to the tips of her toes. It was nice to be appreciated, for someone to acknowledge the little things. Glen wouldn\u2019t notice if she walked through the house wearing nothing but do-me-now red lipstick.</p><p>Daisy: They mean a lot to me, too, Jules.</p><p>Jules: Would it be odd if I chatted you up more often? The American version of chatting, not English, that is. Glen has nothing to worry about. In fact, he\u2019s welcome to join in again.</p><p>Jules was so thoughtful, so not Glen.</p><p>She smiled at the computer screen, and then guilt pricked at her, quick and sharp, though there was nothing inappropriate about her relationship with Jules. Heck, Glen had talked to Jules, several times. They\u2019d given each other a hard time over sports. Something about football versus rugby.</p><p>Daisy: Let me think about it.</p><p>Jules: Of course. Good night.</p><p>Daisy: Night.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she cleared her thoughts. If she and Glen were going to work out, she had to stop comparing Jules to him. It wasn\u2019t fair of her to do so, and if she didn\u2019t stop, then she\u2019d have no choice but to stop talking to Jules. As much as she hated the whole \u201cowed it to him\u201d saying, she did think Glen deserved a second chance. Years of friendship before it turning into more had been the total basis for trying to work things out.</p><p>She set her laptop to one side and jumped out of bed to fix herself a little snack, padding across her bedroom and into the hallway, the wooden floor creaking as she went. Along the way, she paused in the living room to check to see if Glen\u2019s truck was in the drive.</p><p>Pushing the sheer curtains aside, she peeked through the window. The space beside her Honda was empty.</p><p>Where was Glen?</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t texted or called to let her know he\u2019d be late. Something he\u2019d been doing a lot lately, and had been blaming on his extra work duties. But honestly, how much of an extra workload could a high school history teacher/assistant football coach have in the off-season?</p><p>Maybe it had been a mistake to get back together with him, or to allow him to move in with her, since his lease had been up and they were planning to get engaged someday anyway...or so he had implied. Maybe she\u2019d just been too darn lonely to say no.</p><p>But this was Glen. Her Glen. Someone she\u2019d known since seventh grade.</p><p>Walking to the kitchen, she shook her head and muttered, \u201cI love Glen and he loves me. There\u2019s no reason at all to think that he broke up with me right before the holidays so he wouldn\u2019t have to buy me a gift and then got back together once his lease had been up.\u201d</p><p>Cici\u2019s claws tapped on the floor as she ran up to Daisy, wagging her little stump of a tail and banishing Daisy\u2019s less than charitable thoughts of her now on-again boyfriend.</p><p>Daisy knelt on the floor to pet her sweet puppy, if she could call a five-year-old, fifty-two pound dog of indeterminable origins a puppy, but Cici was having none of that and decided she\u2019d rather be a lapdog, tackling her.</p><p>Laughing, Daisy fell on her butt, wet sloppy kisses covering her face. \u201cNeed a little attention, do you?\u201d Gosh, she loved this dog. Three years ago, when she and Glen had first found Cici at the shelter, an instant connection had been made. They had taken one look at that dog\u2019s blue and brown eyes and fallen in love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The back door swung open. Glen walked in, a smile on his face when Cici bounded over to him.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t there a saying about dogs being a good judge of people?</p><p>Slowly, she rose to her feet, dusting off her pajama bottoms. \u201cI was getting worried about you. I made you an extra plate, and I can heat it up if you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p> <p>The smile faded from Glen\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s not want I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know what I cooked tonight,\u201d she said.</p><p>He held out his hands, palms up. \u201cI mean, this isn\u2019t what I want. You\u2019re not what I want.\u201d</p><p>A ball of what felt like dough that\u2019d been left out in the open for too long hit the bottom of her stomach. \u201cIt isn\u2019t? I\u2019m not?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cOh Lazy-Daisy\u2014\u201d Her eye twitched at his juvenile nickname. She\u2019d always hated when he\u2019d call her by it. \u201cNot really. I\u2019ve been thinking and I\u2019m not in love with you anymore. Well, I love you, but more like a friend. There\u2019s no spark, no life to our relationship, and I\u2019m bored. Gina told me to give you another chance, so I did, but it\u2019s not working.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Gina?\u201d she asked, anger merging with furious to make one ticked off baker.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the new guidance counselor at work,\u201d he said slowly, as if speaking to a small child. \u201cI told you all about her.\u201d</p><p>Crossing her arms, she pursed her lips. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you listen to anything I say,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re too busy baking and talking to some guy in England.\u201d</p><p>Blood rushed to her face, heating it. How dare he turn this on her? \u201cExcuse me? I own a bakery, and Jules is a customer.\u201d</p><p>Glen smirked. \u201cYou talk to all of your customers that often?\u201d</p> <p>In fact, there were some she talked to every day and knew everything about, including when their next doctor appointments were and who had hemorrhoids. So sue her if she had a lot of senior citizens for customers. \u201cDon\u2019t make what Jules and I have into something dirty.\u201d</p><p>Petting Cici, he motioned for the dog to go to bed. She went happily and Daisy wished she could join her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d She swallowed and briefly closed her eyes. \u201cDid you cheat on me, Glen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in my heart, with Gina. We really love each other. It\u2019s a mature love, with a woman who has less baggage than you. I can\u2019t handle your baggage.\u201d</p><p>Gaping at his answer, she fought back the tears of anger and frustration. Any love she felt for him was gone, and for it to have left so easily meant it hadn\u2019t really been there in the first place. At least, not this time. \u201cYou\u2019re my baggage, you asshat!\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to one side, a move that she normally thought was endearing, but now it made her want to smack him. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad, honey. A clean break is what\u2019s best for both of us.\u201d</p><p>Pressing her fingers to her temples, she tried to process their conversation. This Glen wasn\u2019t the Glen she loved in high school, or the Glen that had been there for her when her momma had died. No, this Glen was unrecognizable. They\u2019d grown apart while growing up.</p> <p>Hurt raked through her. How could he do this? How could he have led her on? Oh, she knew how, because she had let him.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my house.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cRight this minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself\u2014a clean break is what\u2019s best for both of us. So why draw it out, Glen? Get your crap and leave,\u201d she said, proud that her voice didn\u2019t waver. No matter what, she would be strong.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snapped, marching out of the room.</p><p>While he packed, she paced the kitchen and began to pull out the items she needed to bake...something. By the time she had out everything but the milk and butter, Glen was back, one large suitcase in each hand and Cici on his heels.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I supposed to go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She set the whisk in her hand down on the counter, more for his safety than hers. \u201cTry Gina\u2019s. I\u2019m sure she could counsel you on what to do next.\u201d</p><p>He glanced away from her. \u201cShe still lives with her ex.\u201d</p><p>Daisy snorted. \u201cYou both are idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you suck in bed,\u201d Glen snapped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s entirely your fault, since you\u2019re the only guy I\u2019ve ever slept with,\u201d she replied sweetly. \u201cMaybe Gina will teach you something new, since I\u2019m the only woman you\u2019ve ever slept with.\u201d A fact that had thrilled Daisy to no end. Maybe she could hold on to that memory of him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only woman,\u201d he mumbled, his cheeks heating.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She could barely choke out the word.</p><p>\u201cGina and I, after we broke up...we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the reason why we haven\u2019t had sex in the past two and a half months?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flew to hers. \u201cYou\u2019ve been counting the days?\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, more stupefied than ever. \u201cJust get out, Glen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re a bitch when you want to be.\u201d He turned and Cici followed, wagging her tail. It was at that moment Daisy noticed the leash.</p><p>\u201cNot Cici,\u201d Daisy cried, trying to grab the leash, but Glen simply blocked her body with his and her hands fell helplessly to her sides.</p><p>\u201cShe likes me better, and you know it,\u201d Glen said.</p><p>Daisy did know it, but it still hurt for him to say the words. \u201cBut she\u2019s our dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Cici.\u201d The dog only whined once and then followed Glen out the door, her little stump of a tail wagging happily.</p><p>Daisy managed to keep it together. She didn\u2019t utter a sound as the door shut, or as she heard the car start up and back down her driveway. But as soon as she heard him hit the gas, she sank to the floor in a crumpled heap and cried her eyes out.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she stood up to him? Why hadn\u2019t she refused to let Cici go?</p><p>Because Glen would more than likely grow tired of caring for Cici, like he had before, and he\u2019d call Daisy to come get her, the rational part of her brain reminded her. All Daisy would have to do is be patient.</p><p>\u201cI can be patient and strong,\u201d Daisy whispered.</p><p>Refusing to cry any more tears over that asshat, she scrubbed her tears away and stood, marching to her bedroom. She grabbed her laptop and plopped down on the bed, messaging the first person that came to mind.</p><p>This time, it wasn\u2019t Isabella, her best friend since first grade. It wasn\u2019t Haven, who\u2019d been her other best friend since ninth grade.</p><p>Daisy: Jules! I need you. Please!</p><p>Oh God. Why had she done that? Feeling foolish, she moved the mouse to delete and\u2014</p><p>Jules: I\u2019m here, darling.</p><p>Her hands froze for a moment, and then she began to type. Her hands shook so much that her sentences ran together in places, but she didn\u2019t care. She had to get everything out.</p><p>Daisy: Glen just broke up with me. I told him to get out. He took my dogandhesinolvewithanother woman. Hecheated on me withsomewoman named Gina! He doesn\u2019t love me except as a FRIEND. Cici left me too. He took my DOG with him.</p><p>Jules: I\u2019ll hunt the bastard down, cut off his testicles, and make him eat them.</p><p>She half laugh-half sobbed at his reply.</p><p>Jules: I\u2019m not joking, love. Say the word and it shall be done.</p><p>Daisy: Thank you, but I\u2019d rather you stay out of jail. I could use a shoulder to cry on though.</p><p>Jules: I can be there by seven AM your time.</p><p>Daisy: Six fifty-five. Tell the pilot to fly faster.</p><p>Jules: If you give me a minute, I\u2019ll arrange it. What are your favorite breakfast foods?</p><p>Daisy: Everything is my favorite food. I love to eat.</p><p>Jules: I\u2019d love to feed you. Honestly, I only want you to feel better.</p><p>Daisy: You don\u2019t have time to listen. It\u2019s late and I have to talk things out. I\u2019ll\u2014</p><p>Jules: Time is all I really have, and it\u2019s all yours. I guess you can say that my time belongs to you.</p><p>From that point on, she shared everything that had ever mattered to her with Jules. Her dad\u2019s death in Afghanistan when she was barely three, her mother\u2019s death from cancer four years ago, the insurance bills that still cropped up every so often she had to pay, and how damn alone she\u2019d felt afterwards, even with her best friends, Isabella, Haven, and Glen being there for her every step of the way. Which was why his betrayal hurt so bad. Glen had been her best friend. Her everything that Isabella and Haven couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Daisy: The worst part is that I think Glen was right. We really did love each other as friends...only friends don\u2019t do that, you know. They don\u2019t betray you like that.</p><p>Jules: Do you want to salvage your friendship with Glen?</p><p>Daisy thought she\u2019d need time to think it over\u2014time to weigh the pros and cons, but she didn\u2019t. Her fingers did the deciding for her.</p><p>Daisy: HELL NO!</p><p>Jules: Then it\u2019s settled. Concentrate on making new friends.</p><p>Daisy: Like you?</p><p>Jules: I thought we were already were friends.</p><p>Daisy: The very best.</p><p>The sky started to lighten, and she blinked her sleepy eyes. They felt dry, scratchy, and raw, just like the rest of her.</p><p>Daisy: Are you almost here? I don\u2019t think I can stay awake any longer and you have to be exhausted.</p><p>Jules: Don\u2019t fall asleep on me now. My shoulder is ready for you. Ah, there is your driveway.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>The sound of tires rolling over gravel made her blink. She was hearing things. She glanced at the clock. 6:55 on the dot.</p><p>Daisy: lol. My mind is playing tricks on me. I swear it sounded like a car just drove up. I have to go to bed now. Besides, isn\u2019t your virtual shoulder wet from all my virtual tears?</p><p>Jules: I changed clothes. Are you quite sure you don\u2019t need me?</p><p>Daisy: I did need you and you were there for me. You even kept me from chewing a hole in my cheek. It\u2019s a bad habit of mine.</p><p>Jules: I\u2019d say so. You really need to work on not doing that when you\u2019re upset.</p><p>Daisy: I\u2019ll do my best. \uf04a Now I really need to sleep. Thank you, Jules, for everything. Talk to you tomorrow?</p><p>Jules: Of course. My time belongs to you. Night, love.</p><p>Daisy: Night. \uf04a</p><p>She closed her laptop and let her head fall to her pillow.</p><p>Later that afternoon, she opened the front door and a bouquet of flowers, in every color imaginable, awaited her. Beside it was a large cooler. She opened it and found containers of food, along with a handwritten note.</p><p>Daisy,</p><p>I hope you enjoy this traditional English breakfast, and the flowers. Any time you need me, say the word and I\u2019ll be there\u2014virtually or in real life.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Jules</p><p>PS: This cost a lot more to have delivered than a single cupcake, and it was no hardship. So stop feeling guilty.</p><p>PPS: Glen\u2019s a wanker.</p><p>PPPS: Talk to you tomorrow\u2014I need sleep!</p><p>PPPPS: You can text me anytime. I\u2019ll be able to answer you more quickly.</p><p>He\u2019d given her his number. She clutched the note to her chest and smiled dreamily, while wondering if she\u2019d ever get to meet him.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad, you know that, right?\u201d the voice on the phone barked.</p><p>Sebastian hit send on the email he\u2019d just finished composing, and replied, \u201cIf by mad, you mean genius, then yes.\u201d He ended the call just as his other phone buzzed and smiled.</p><p>Daisy: My date sucked last night.</p><p>Jules: But you went on one and that\u2019s the first step to getting back in the game, as the kids say.</p><p>Daisy: Ugh. I\u2019d rather be on the sidelines. He was all handsy and committed too many fouls.</p><p>Sebastian fought the rising tide of jealous, and lost. He didn\u2019t want another man\u2019s hands on her, another man\u2019s mouth kissing her, or worse, another man\u2019s arms around her, comforting her or encouraging her while knowing all the very mundane things about her that Sebastian would give away his entire inheritance to be privy to.</p><p>Jules: Shall I take care of this miscreant?</p><p>Daisy: lol. No, I took care of him. How are things going with Kate?</p><p>Jules: They\u2019re not.</p><p>The door to his office burst open, and Liam Stewart strode in, his dark eyes narrowing. Liam was Sebastian\u2019s oldest friend. They\u2019d met their first year at Eton, and there was no one else he trusted more.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong and you know it. Hanging up on me won\u2019t change the fact that the deal you made with Javenesky is so incredibly wrong and shady. He\u2019s a rumored arms\u2019 dealer.\u201d The door closed with a slam behind him. \u201cPut down the damn mobile phone, Sebastian, and listen to me,\u201d he snapped, stopping just short of the massive desk that sat in front of a wall of windows.</p><p>\u201cMy last name is Romanov. Everything my family does is wrong and shady,\u201d Sebastian pointed out. By making a deal with some even shadier underworld types, he would seal the fate of Romanov Industries. Once the public knew, his father would be humiliated and then the business would have to be sold, piece by piece, and he would be done. He would have peace. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll put down my mobile when I\u2019m bloody well ready.\u201d</p><p>Daisy: Breaking up with her? That\u2019s so sad.</p><p>He was a little sad but he\u2019d tried, because Daisy had been the one to encourage him to date in the first place. Perhaps he hadn\u2019t tried as hard as he could have, with Daisy constantly on his mind and in his computer and phone, but he\u2019d tried to be a good boyfriend to Kate, only being one required time he didn\u2019t have. Romanov Industries came first\u2014as did Daisy. They were in a dead heat.</p><p>The best thing he could say he\u2019d done for Kate was not to have slept with her. If he had, their breakup would have been more disastrous than it already was. He knew Kate was in love with him and would have been willing, but he couldn\u2019t take advantage of that love to satisfy his base needs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daisy: But I bet it will be less confusing for you.</p><p>Jules: ?</p><p>Daisy: Every woman in England is named Kate. What do you do when you can\u2019t find each other out in public? If you yell Kate, a million women answer you. ;)</p> <p>He made a noise, a cross between a snort and a grunt.</p><p>Jules: Don\u2019t quit your day job, darling.</p><p>Daisy: I am funny. You said so last night.</p><p>Liam exhaled. \u201cThis scheme of yours will get you fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s what I want to happen,\u201d Sebastian muttered as his fingers flew over the keys.</p> <p>Jules: I was drunk.</p><p>Daisy: Tea makes you drunk? What in the world did you add, besides honey and lemon?</p><p>He inwardly grinned. She knew exactly how he took his tea, and that he liked to drink it right before bed.</p><p>Jules: Fine. You were uproariously hilarious.</p><p>Daisy: Knew it. \uf04a</p><p>\u201cPerhaps when it does, you\u2019ll get yourself sorted out,\u201d Liam murmured and Sebastian stopped typing.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d</p><p>Leaning against Sebastian\u2019s desk, his best friend ran a hand through his dark hair and worked at his tie. \u201cOrdinarily, I classify you as not in the \u201che\u2019s not a tosser group\u201d, but this... It\u2019s going to hurt the wrong people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only person it will hurt is Vladimir, and since he\u2019s off in Morocco with his latest mistress, I\u2019ll try not to get all\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door to his office swung open, and Ivan, his head of security walked in, grimmer than usual. \u201cIt\u2019s been reported that your father\u2019s yacht has exploded.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian wasn\u2019t surprised, not with the enemies Vladimir had made over the years. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll purchase a new one straightaway.\u201d</p><p>Ivan shook his head, and Sebastian suddenly felt queasy.</p><p>\u201cNyet. Mr. Romanov and his friend were on it at the time.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s vision blurred and there was a foreign pressure on his shoulder, squeezing him tight. He couldn\u2019t breathe. There wasn\u2019t enough air in the room and his tie was strangling him. He shot to his feet, his desk chair toppling to the floor with a loud bang against the marble, and clawed at the collar of his shirt.</p> <p>\u201cBastian,\u201d he heard Liam say.</p><p>An image of his father lifting him and Christian high in the air came to mind. The day was cold and sunny. Their mother had suggested an outing at the park. Vladimir had smiled at the three of them, his eyes bright blue and kind, as they ate their lunch. Contentment had flowed through his little body as they ran, trying to hoist a kite made of construction paper and straws into the sky.</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d he whispered, small child and grown man at the same time.</p><p>\u201cMr. Romanov?\u201d</p><p>The image faded. \u201cChrist,\u201d he swore and pushed Liam away. He didn\u2019t need his comfort. He didn\u2019t want his comfort. \u201cTake what you need, Ivan, and find out who\u2019s responsible so they can be properly dealt with by the authorities.\u201d</p><p>Ivan nodded. He knew exactly what Sebastian meant, and Sebastian was the only authority his head of security and personal bodyguard would obey.</p><p>He clenched his jaw and turned to face the window. God, he hated the view and the office, but he couldn\u2019t leave. He was trapped by years of training, years of discipline by his father.</p><p>So, although he wanted to go with Ivan, he didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t. Hadn\u2019t his father drilled the keep-your-nose clean mantra into his head for years? Sebastian, the Golden Child. The heir to the throne of the Romanov Empire. The one to make it above board in all things. Totally legitimate and legal.</p><p>Until now. Until Sebastian\u2019s carefully laid plans had been thwarted by someone who hated his father more than he did.</p><p>\u201cI know you and Vladimir weren\u2019t on the best of terms, but still, bloody hell, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Liam said softly from behind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d Sebastian bit out and pivoted to face his friend. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t blow up the bastard myself.\u201d Then he walked out of his office, down the hall, and made his way outside, into the dreary English afternoon.</p><p>Two weeks later</p><p>Daisy: Did you get the cupcakes I sent?</p><p>Jules: I did. Thank you.</p><p>Daisy: You\u2019re welcome. You know...if you need a shoulder to cry on, I have one available. Or just lean on, since men don\u2019t cry. But if you do, that\u2019s okay. I won\u2019t tell.</p><p>Jules: I\u2019ll sort it all out on my own, but thank you.</p><p>Daisy: You\u2019re welcome. So...how\u2019s the weather?</p><p>Jules: Dreary, like my soul.</p><p>Daisy sent Jules an image of two people hugging. Ever since his father had passed away in his sleep, Jules had been noticeably quieter, not that she expected him to be chatty over e-mails and texts, but he was subdued, and there was nothing she could do about it, other than send him cupcakes and be there for him, in whatever way he needed her.</p><p>He sent her back a heart, and her heart danced in her chest, making it feel lighter than it had in days. Last week, after making no progress at all with the insurance company for the most recent and most expensive bill she\u2019d ever been required to pay, she finally put her house up for sale. Her realtor had already secured a showing for this afternoon. Too bad the woman couldn\u2019t have waited for a Monday, so Daisy could at least have the distraction of work.</p><p>Jules: What are you up to today?</p><p>Daisy glanced around Holland Springs Meadows before sitting down on a bench under a leafy green tree. Flags were placed on the graves of the fallen, including her dad\u2019s, in honor of their service.</p><p>Daisy: Visiting my parents.</p><p>Jules: Does it ever get easier?</p><p>Tears blurred her vision, and the screen of her phone became unreadable.</p><p>Daisy: Not as fast as I\u2019d like, but with friends like you, Haven, and Bella, it doesn\u2019t get any harder.</p><p>Jules: Is there\u2019s hope for me?</p><p>Daisy: Always.</p><p>One month later</p><p>Jules: I miss him, and I hate it. It\u2019s like he\u2019s all around me, and I can\u2019t purge him fast enough.</p><p>Daisy: Take deep breaths. You don\u2019t have to do it all at once.</p><p>Jules: So it\u2019s okay for me to feel this way?</p><p>Daisy: As long as you\u2019re feeling something, I think so.</p><p>Jules: What if I told you I was glad he was dead?</p><p>Daisy: Then I\u2019d listen.</p><p>Jules: And?</p><p>Daisy: And what?</p><p>Jules: Obviously, that makes me a monster.</p><p>Daisy: No, it makes you human.</p><p>Jules: Thank you.</p><p>Daisy: What about your mom? Where does she fit in all this?</p><p>Jules: She practically danced on his grave. We don\u2019t speak much.</p><p>Daisy: Maybe when all of this is over and everyone\u2019s feelings have had a chance to settle, you\u2019ll be able to speak to her a lot more.</p><p>Jules: Doubtful. Tell me something about your day. Something to make me smile and forget.</p><p>Daisy: This morning I put salt instead of sugar in my blueberry pie. It was disgusting. One of my customers ate an entire slice before telling me. She didn\u2019t want to hurt my feelings. So I made her two whole pies, the right way, and sent them home with her.</p><p>Jules: God, I wish I could hold you right now...please disregard if I\u2019ve overstepped my bounds.</p><p>Daisy: I\u2019ll book a flight and you can hold me by tonight.</p><p>Jules: Save your money. I\u2019m not fit for company, and the place I\u2019m stuck in doesn\u2019t help.</p><p>Daisy: Then go somewhere that has good memories for you.</p><p>Jules: I don\u2019t have a place like that.</p><p>Daisy: Then make one. I\u2019ll mail your cupcakes there.</p><p>Three months later</p><p>Jules: Finally sold the house I\u2019d shared with my father, and bought a new one in a village called Cheam. The house is all brick, with ivy growing up the front. There\u2019s a heart-shaped door knocker on the front door. The kitchen made me think of you\u2014shiny appliances and lots of counter space. The garden in the back is nice. There\u2019s a place where you can dine al fresco. I think you would love it.</p><p>Daisy: Send me pictures and I can pretend I\u2019m there with you, cooking for us in your kitchen and eating outside while the birds sing and the breeze blows.</p><p>Jules: Do you think other people text like this?</p><p>Daisy: Who cares what other people do?</p><p>Jules: I care about what you think.</p><p>Daisy: Me too.</p><p>Jules: Do you have a Bucket List?</p><p>Daisy: I do. First thing on it: Go to England</p><p>Jules: I\u2019m flattered.</p><p>Daisy: Um...I wrote it three years before I met you. Sorry. What\u2019s your first one?</p><p>Jules: Ouch! A place to call home, with the woman who loves me waiting inside.</p><p>Daisy: That\u2019s a very nice first.</p><p>Jules: Wishful thinking is always very nice.</p><p>Five months later</p><p>Daisy: Someone bought my house, for more than I hoped to get.</p><p>Jules: This makes you happy, yes? You can pay off that one last pesky insurance bill.</p><p>Daisy: I\u2019ve never lived anywhere else. I feel like I\u2019ve sold a piece of my heart.</p><p>Jules: Maybe the new owner will rent it out to you.</p><p>Daisy: I don\u2019t want to rent it. Sending a check every month would remind me of what I\u2019ve lost.</p><p>Jules: So what now?</p><p>Daisy: I found an apartment. It\u2019s in town.</p><p>Jules: You can make happy memories there.</p><p>Daisy: Come stay with me, and you can be a part of them. Promise I won\u2019t bite, and I\u2019m not insane.</p><p>Jules: I\u2019d love to, but I\u2019m still not fit for company. In fact, I won\u2019t be around for a month or two, if not longer.</p><p>Daisy: What are you up to, Jules? I\u2019m worried for you.</p><p>Jules: Very bad things. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s hard to kill a monster.</p><p>Daisy: You\u2019re not a monster. Stop beating yourself up.</p><p>Jules: I think it\u2019s best if we don\u2019t talk for a while.</p><p>Daisy: Although that\u2019s not what I want, I\u2019ll respect your wishes. Please find someone to talk to. I think you\u2019re having a harder time with your dad\u2019s death than you think.</p><p>Jules: Good-bye, Daisy.</p><p>Sebastian strolled down a dark street in West End, without his bodyguards in tow. Not the smartest idea he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>Lately, however, whatever had seemed smart was immediately discarded in favor of really bad ideas. Or in this case, really bad parts of the city. On a foggy (what else?) night.</p><p>Honestly, he didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d been living life like his twin used to live: carelessly and selfishly. His affairs were public, his partying endless, and his behavior extremely rude.</p><p>So much so, that his closest friends had stopped going out with him. Hell, all but Liam had stopped answering his calls. Even Kate avoided him, and she\u2019d known him for as long as Liam had. Though he was sure their very public breakup had something to do with it.</p><p>Not that he cared anymore. He didn\u2019t care about anyone or anything. Well, that wasn\u2019t entirely true.</p><p>Try as he might, he could not put one woman out of his mind. Daisy filled his waking hours, sober or not. She filled his dreams. Her name was constantly on his lips, no matter whose lips were on him.</p><p>This, of course, made him the worst sort of ass. It made him a user. It made him his father.</p><p>Pausing in front of a darkened shop, he exhaled and wondered for the first time if what he was doing made any sense. How was being this way getting back at Vladimir if he was becoming exactly like him? Or at the very least, a pale imitation of the man.</p><p>There were some things Vladimir had done that Sebastian would never lower himself to do. Some things he would never use his power, position, or strength to do to another human being.</p><p>All at once, he heard a smack and then a woman screamed. His first instinct was to call 999 for help, and stay firmly put in order help the police. His second instinct was to take matters into his own hands.</p><p>Another scream and he took off, running as fast as he could. He just could make out the blurred shapes of two people, one noticeably bigger than the other. The fog cleared and Sebastian was practically on top of them.</p><p>The woman shoved at the man. \u201cGet off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange your mind yet?\u201d The man raised his arm, one hand a beefy fist ready to strike.</p><p>Without thinking, Sebastian stepped forward, grabbed the man\u2019s wrist, and spun him around. He jerked the man\u2019s arm up and pressed it against his back. \u201cBetter keep your hands to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian shook his head. \u201cAh, but it does. It concerns every man when a woman\u2019s being abused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hit me first,\u201d the man whined. \u201cAnd she owes me money.\u201d</p><p>Cold fury rose inside of Sebastian. Vladimir used to make the same excuse whenever he would lay a hand on Sebastian and Christian\u2019s mother. She made me do it. She hit me first. Always, his father blamed the victim. They had it coming.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d the woman spat. She turned pleading eyes on Sebastian. \u201cHe sold me to one of his mates. I can\u2019t go through that again, but I\u2019ve a little one at home, and she needs to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were willing enough, until this guy showed up,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Sebastian tightened his grip and turned the man\u2019s hand at a rather painful angle\u2014something Sebastian knew from firsthand experience. The man let out a scream when the wrist bone on the right cracked. \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll stay away from her. Just let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Sebastian said coldly and then turned to the woman standing beside him. Her face was battered and bruised, her clothes torn on her skinny body, and her hair stringy, but she didn\u2019t have the look of a junkie, not that it mattered to him. He would help her and her child (if she really had one), regardless.</p><p>The man struggled against him, landing a blow to the side of Sebastian head. His ear rung and his vision blurred, but he\u2019d had suffered worse. Far worse. These were like love taps compared to what his father and his father\u2019s former bodyguards had done to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sebastian smiled. \u201cHit me again.\u201d Or else wasn\u2019t said or unsaid. The statement was there.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHit me again,\u201d he repeated.</p> <p>The man\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re insane. Who the hell smiles after getting punched in the head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Sebastian turned his attention to the woman, still standing there. Trembling in fear and cold. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, love?\u201d he asked softly. He didn\u2019t want to scare her.</p><p>\u201cMolly B\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need a surname.\u201d Sebastian smiled gently. \u201cNow, would you\u2019d be so kind as to grab my mobile from my left coat pocket, go to my contacts, and call Ivan?\u201d</p><p>Molly hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019d trust me to not run off with it?\u201d</p> <p>No, he didn\u2019t. \u201cLet me help you, Molly. Call Ivan and he\u2019ll come round with a car. We\u2019ll go pick up your little one and take you both to a very safe place where no one can hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Molly stretched out her hand. It shook. \u201cHow do I know you won\u2019t hurt me more than Frank has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d He looked at Frank, who stared back at him like he was the very Devil. \u201cWhatever you decide, I\u2019ll take care of this one. Won\u2019t I, big boy?\u201d Then he applied more pressure and finished breaking the rest of Frank\u2019s wrist bones.</p><p>Two days later, Sebastian stood outside the back entrance of the safe house, with the director. She was a no-nonsense woman who he had complete confidence in and used the money he sent every month wisely. The former mansion could house up to thirty women and children. It wasn\u2019t the only one he supported. There were twenty more like it throughout Scotland, Ireland, and England.</p><p>Helping these women and their children wasn\u2019t something he bragged about, and not because he was a humble man either. He wasn\u2019t. It was shameful that these houses had to exist in the first place, but they were needed. And so, he had provided them.</p><p>\u201cMolly\u2019s fitting in very nicely here, Mr. Romanov. Her little one\u2019s already playing with the others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cShe asked for your name,\u201d the director said.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised. Molly had asked him on the limo ride over, right before she put her hand on his crotch and offered to pay him back. He\u2019d let her down gently, moving her hand away. She\u2019d collapsed against him, crying, and he\u2019d let her, offering his handkerchief when she was done.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d he asked, already knowing the answer. She\u2019d say nothing at all, of course.</p><p>\u201cThat names weren\u2019t important around here, only deeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve need of a director for a new house in Glasgow. Know anyone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The director didn\u2019t blink. A breeze blew a lock of platinum hair over the scarred side of her face. Her ex-husband had taken a razor to her, and since owning a gun hadn\u2019t been an option, the restraining order had become just as shredded as her face when he\u2019d broken into her flat.</p><p>A nosy neighbor had saved her, and brought her to Childers, where his father had been a patient at the time. Sebastian heard the story, and had paid for her to be moved to a nicer place, with private medical care.</p> <p>She\u2019d healed, written him a thank you note, and he\u2019d responded by offering her a job, but not before doing a thorough background check on her.</p><p>\u201cI might have someone in mind. Unfortunately,\u201d she said.</p><p>He watched as the director went inside, using a code that even he didn\u2019t know, and locked the door behind her.</p><p>Suddenly, he realized that he was tired. That he was lonely, and he wanted his old life back. It was time for him to quit feeling sorry for himself and move forward.</p><p>Two days later</p><p>Jules: I\u2019m back.</p><p>Daisy: Better?</p><p>Jules: Getting there.</p><p>Daisy: I missed you. Did you meet someone?</p><p>Jules: Would it have mattered if I had?</p><p>Daisy: Yes, and it only took a week of not talking being able to you everyday to realize it.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s fingers froze over the keyboard. It was time to end the charade. He was in too deep and was dragging her after him. But the place he was in right now, the place he\u2019d most likely forever be, was no place for her. He had to end things. Make up an excuse, tell her that he had in fact met someone, or lie, like he\u2019d been doing all along.</p><p>Only he couldn\u2019t, because he loved Daisy.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t all sorted out, yet.</p><p>Jules: Give me time, darling, and I\u2019ll be all yours.</p><p>Daisy: My time belongs to you.</p><p>Oh yeah, he was done for, and completely confident he could find a way to reveal the truth to her and make their virtual relationship a reality.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>One month later</p><p>Sebastian sat at his desk, going over the fine print of the Xeron-Chang Contract, when Liam walked in his office.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d Liam said, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>Actually, Sebastian thought he\u2019d be elated at the outcome, but he felt as though someone had punched him in the gut and the groin. Simultaneously.</p><p>Fact: He had planned for this, by making shady deals with even shadier characters on project guaranteed to lose money.</p><p>Fact: He\u2019d wanted this to happen. The total embarrassment of his father had been his ultimate goal.</p><p>Fact: His father had been killed, most likely murdered, so that goal was no longer attainable.</p><p>Result: Well, Liam had given it to him.</p><p>None of that signified, however. He could repair the damage, and convince the right people to see thing his way once more. \u201cI can\u2019t be fired,\u201d Sebastian said, glancing at the paper in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSebastian.\u201d</p><p>He forced himself to look at the man standing to his right. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Liam stared at him, worry and concern shining in his dark eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve been voted out. Five ayes, one no, and an abstain.\u201d</p><p>The voice of his dead father slithered inside his head. You are nothing without me. You are nothing without Romanov Industries. I made you.</p><p>Steeling himself, he cleared his throat. \u201cI assume you were the abstain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I voted aye.\u201d Liam\u2019s dark brows drew together. \u201cYou really can\u2019t expect me to let you continue down this path of self-destruction. You can\u2019t punish everyone else for your father\u2019s crimes.\u201d</p><p>So Liam knew. \u201cShall I collect my things and be off?\u201d</p><p>Liam held up a hand. \u201cI made a motion that you be allowed stay on, and the Board agreed.\u201d He canted his head to one side. \u201cIn a completely limited role, of course, as a consultant and point man for the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow magnanimous,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but saying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very magnanimous, you pompous ass,\u201d Liam snapped. \u201cI put my reputation on the line for you.\u201d Shoving his hands into his pockets, his best friend began to pace the room. \u201cThey think you\u2019re a loose cannon, like your father, in regards to your personal life, and this little \u2018Oh I\u2019m back and will be so very good, sir\u2019 act is just that to them\u2014an act. No one trusts you.\u201d</p><p>Not even you, Liam? he wanted to ask, but he didn\u2019t want to know the answer. \u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could actually start properly dating a woman, perhaps let it lead to an engagement, sort out things with your brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to lie?\u201d</p><p>Liam stopped in front of Sebastian\u2019s desk, placing his hands on the top and leaning forward. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend to have grown a conscience in the past two minutes.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian shot to his feet, getting right in his best mate\u2019s face. \u201cI am not Vladimir Romanov, and you, of all people, should know that,\u201d he growled. He slammed his fist against the desk, but the only reaction he got out of Liam was a mocking smile.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s phone buzzed, but he didn\u2019t answer it.</p><p>Liam\u2019s gaze went right to where Sebastian\u2019s phone set on his desk, and that mocking smile turned into a smirk. \u201cOh, what a tangled web we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it,\u201d he muttered, straightening. He smoothed back his hair and readjusted his tie.</p><p>Palms up, Liam stepped back. \u201cSeriously, get back together with Kate. Hell, fill her in on the entire scheme. Make it look like you give a damn about anything and anyone who isn\u2019t you. Make them think you want this job. Be the exact opposite of your father and make your family want to be around you.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian wanted to defend himself, and say that he wasn\u2019t a cold bastard like his father, but since his father\u2019s death, he had actually become one. Most of his friends, like Liam, had overlooked it for the most part, since he\u2019d seen the light. He owed them his gratitude, and an apology.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather try to repair things with Christian than re-open an old wound with Kate,\u201d he said, already deciding he would leave right after work and board the company jet to fly to the States, to the very town where the woman he adored from afar lived and waited on him. No, not him. Jules.</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s the Sebastian I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad my family doesn\u2019t know him.\u201d Sebastian smiled wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a bad man, Sebastian, to those of us that know you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think my family\u2014my twin brother of all people\u2014should know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only let them see glimpses of the real you,\u201d Liam reminded him.</p><p>Sebastian raised his brows. \u201cAh, but did they bother looking?\u201d</p><p>Plopping down in her office chair, Daisy tossed the certified letter she\u2019d just received onto her desk. \u201cStupid insurance company.\u201d</p><p>Dealing with them was going to be the death of her, and she only had a month to decide whether or not to go through with arbitration.</p><p>Yeah, because money was suddenly going to start growing on trees and she could just go outside and pluck off a few hundred grand to pay for everything.</p><p>Her lawyer had been the one to recommended arbitration and to get it over with as soon as possible.</p><p>She pushed the letters from the insurance company and her lawyer to the side and frowned. It seemed like every time she thought she was free, something else rose up to bite her on the rear.</p><p>It had turned out that the final six months of her mother\u2019s life spent at the best hospice insurance could buy hadn\u2019t been covered after all. A clerical error was to blame, and now she\u2014once again\u2014had to pay up.</p><p>What was she going to do?</p><p>All of her money was in her business and she had just hired some part-time help that would start as soon The Sweet Spot was up and running in its new location.</p><p>She and Isabella had decided to join forces and open a bakery/bookstore in the town. Unfortunately, the only building they could afford to rent was in the middle of major renovations. On the bright side, they\u2019d signed a lease in time for the renovations to include a state-of-the-art workspace for Daisy.</p><p>Every time she saw the design, she wanted to swoon and tell Jules, but she hadn\u2019t yet. She had wanted to surprise him with her new adventure into expanding her business.</p><p>Only now she wanted to go back and not agree to anything at all, which made her the worst business partner and best friend on earth.</p><p>Isabella swept into her office.</p><p>And there was the best business partner and best friend on earth, Daisy thought glumly.</p><p>Dressed in dark jeans and a lime green sweater, Bella radiated happiness as she brushed a strand of caramel-colored hair behind her ear. \u201cHi\u2014oh, no. Did Glen text you again?\u201d</p><p>A little laugh escaped Daisy. \u201cNot since the last one, where he said he\u2019d changed his mind and was really in love with Nina now and not Gina. Gosh, that man has a thing for rhyming.\u201d Every so often, she would get a random text from Glen, saying that he missed her, that he\u2019d been wrong and they needed to work things out. She had deleted every last one, and would then call Bella or Haven to tell them.</p><p>And Jules. She shared everything with Jules.</p><p>\u201cOh good. I\u2019d hate to go all medieval on him.\u201d</p><p>Daisy rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat happened to turn the other cheek, preacher\u2019s daughter?\u201d Although she wanted to thank God Isabella didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on. Not exactly the best business move, but what could Daisy tell her that wouldn\u2019t send her best friend into a panic?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going for the smite thy best friend\u2019s no good, rat bastard of an ex-boyfriend that keeps bothering her with texts months after the break-up type of thing. After all, that\u2019s exactly what Jesus would do.\u201d</p><p>A giggle escaped the confines of her mouth. Rising to her feet, Daisy walked around her desk and gave Isabella a hug. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Want a taste of the menu I\u2019ve made for Christian and Zoe?\u201d</p><p>The unmistakable sound of a hammer being wielded made Daisy and her best friend wince. Maybe she had moved in too soon. Renovations on the historic building seemed to be taking forever, mostly because almost everything the owner did had to be approved by the town\u2019s historical society. The plans alone had taken almost a year. Thank God for their General Contractor.</p><p>\u201cOnly four more weeks of construction, D, four more weeks,\u201d Isabella said.</p><p>\u201cAt least they leave by six PM.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sweetheart for putting up with it.\u201d Isabelle picked up a bite-sized cucumber sandwich and popped it in her mouth. \u201cI could eat this entire plate.\u201d She reached for another one, but Daisy smacked her hand.</p><p>\u201cI said a taste, you glutton.\u201d Daisy took the plate and placed it back in the fridge, then turned to face her friend. \u201cWhat brings you by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d Isabella asked, tawny eyes shining. \u201cPeter and I are going to elope this weekend instead of waiting until October to get married. I hope you\u2019re not mad. I mean, you are\u2014were\u2014supposed to be my maid of honor and all. Haven\u2019s not speaking to me over this, but I hope you won\u2019t take it so hard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Having that honor taken away was the last thing that concerned Daisy. She had a really bad feeling about this, but it wouldn\u2019t do any good to share that with Isabella. Daisy knew without a doubt she wouldn\u2019t be able to change her stubborn best friend\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cHaven is Haven. She\u2019ll be back to her old self soon. As for me\u2014I\u2019m excited for you.\u201d She smiled at her best friend. \u201cWhen y\u2019all come back, I\u2019ll throw you the biggest party Holland Springs has ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Isabella raced around the island and gave Daisy a tight hug, then released her. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet, but we all know that our resident movie star\u2019s wedding is going to blow all our minds.\u201d</p> <p>Thinking about what the wedding planner had shared with her, Daisy nodded. \u201cFireworks and one of the big name pop acts and that\u2019s only for the rehearsal dinner. The ceremony itself will be insanely over-the-top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be famous, once all those celebrities taste your amazing food.\u201d Isabella tilted her head to one side, studying Daisy until she flushed. \u201cAnything I can do to help you with the insurance stuff?\u201d</p><p>Eyes rounding, Daisy said, \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Isabella waved a hand in the air. \u201cThat stupid letter has been on your desk for days, and you drove all the way to Wilson last week. On a Thursday\u2014that\u2019s restocking day and you never veer from schedule.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling, the tightness in her chest eased a little. \u201cMy lawyer is confident we can work something out that\u2019s manageable for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure catering the Wedding of the Century doesn\u2019t hurt things either.\u201d</p><p>Well, it wouldn\u2019t not hurt things. \u201cExactly. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, Mrs. Peter H. Mitchell-to-be, I have celebrity clients to impress.\u201d Daisy glanced at the clock on her oven. \u201cUnusually late clients. Christian and Zoe are always on time. Maybe I should text\u2014\u201c</p><p>Her phone vibrated and Isabella snagged it from the island, then handed it to her with a wink. \u201cMust have known you were talking about her.\u201d</p><p>Zoe: Unexpected visitor. We\u2019ll be thirty minutes late. \uf04c Is that okay?</p><p>Daisy: See you in thirty. \uf04a Or we can reschedule. I\u2019m flexible.</p><p>Well, this week Daisy was, because she didn\u2019t have any clients scheduled. In fact, she had lightened her workload considerably since she\u2019d agreed to go into business with Isabella. Something that now made her panic.</p> <p>Zoe: We\u2019ll be there in thirty. Thank you. Xo</p><p>\u201cLate, right?\u201d Isabella got a paper plate from one of the cabinets and loaded it up. \u201cThis will make a great lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNature of the beast.\u201d Realizing what she was implying, Daisy hastily added, \u201cNot that Zoe\u2019s a bridezilla. She\u2019s the exact opposite. Aunt Leah, however...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to explain, I\u2019ve been a passenger on that crazy train before,\u201d Isabella said around a sandwich as she headed to the door. \u201cBest thing ever when Zoe and my brother decided not to get married. Although, I wouldn\u2019t have minded having Zoe as my sister-in-law, but her mom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Leah\u2019s not all bad,\u201d Daisy protested weakly, but she knew the truth. The woman was exacting, demanding, and opinionated. Something Daisy had a hard time stomaching. However, Aunt Leah had been Daisy\u2019s mother\u2019s best friend growing up and had married Daisy\u2019s uncle. Family had to stick with family. \u201cShe\u2019s...herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so are you, which she should be thankful for. Wish me luck and say hello to Jules for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Good luck!\u201d Furrowing her brows, Daisy filled up a glass pitcher with ice and water, and then set it on the island. \u201cWait, what for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter and I are heading to his grandparents\u2019 place up in Martha\u2019s Vineyard for an engagement party. Supposedly, the President has been invited,\u201d she said, clearly teasing. Peter and Isabella had been engaged for three months. His family owned a national baseball team, not to mention the ears of politicians.</p> <p>Daisy grinned. She liked Peter, for the most part. His twenty-two-year-old widowed stepmother, not so much. That tart was always giving Peter looks, and sometimes, she thought Peter gave them right back. It was a sore subject for Isabella, so Daisy and Haven had agreed to stop bringing it up and instead concentrate on being happy for their best friend.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, Miss High Society. Sure you\u2019ll be able to mingle with the commoners when you get back?\u201d she asked, wiggling her brows.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. See you in a few days.\u201d Isabella blew her a kiss. \u201cAre we still on for dinner, before the silent auction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>After Isabella left, Daisy moved to her desk again and sat down. Her email notification pinged and she enlarged the tab.</p><p>Grin transforming into a full on smile, she opened the email from her Englishman.</p><p>Daisy,</p><p>I won\u2019t be able to place my usual order. I\u2019m out of town on business. Actually, it\u2019s family stuff. Bloody, boring family business stuff. I hope to have all this behind me within the next two weeks, so that you and I can concentrate on other things.</p><p>How are things with you? Everything sorted with your mother\u2019s latest bill, yet? Sure I can\u2019t order ONE BILLION CUPCAKES to solve all of your problems, and then we can run off together into the sunset?</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Jules</p><p>She grabbed her phone and began to text him.</p><p>Daisy: I don\u2019t think they make enough sunscreen to protect our skin if we did that. ;)</p><p>Jules: Har, har. Sorry about the lack of order this week and the next.</p><p>Daisy: You think I only talk to you for your business?</p><p>Jules: Sometimes. ;)</p><p>Daisy: Fine, then in order for me to continue talking to you, you have to order ONE BILLION of them.</p><p>Jules: I really could, you know.</p><p>Daisy: You and Dr. Evil.</p><p>Jules: A fair comparison. Can you see my pinky finger held just so? Perhaps I\u2019ll get my mini-me to take a selfie.</p><p>Daisy: Are we really ready for pictures? Gosh, after nine months, we might be moving too quickly. ;)</p><p>She was halfway joking. In all this time, she\u2019d never seen him, not even on Facebook. Not that that was odd. Most guys she knew didn\u2019t have an account, or either used it sparingly. Heck she barely had time for her personal page and devoted most of her time to The Sweet Spot\u2019s page.</p><p>Jules: It wouldn\u2019t do my or your imagination justice. I already know you\u2019re a glorious creature.</p><p>She twisted her lips. He\u2019d totally sidestepped that one.</p><p>Daisy: Ha! Flatterer. Send me your celebrity look-alike instead. Then I\u2019ll send you mine.</p><p>For a few minutes, Jules didn\u2019t reply and she wondered if she\u2019d said something wrong. Maybe he didn\u2019t like being compared to a guy with a really bad past. Or\u2014</p><p>Jules: How about him?</p><p>She opened the attachment and laughed.</p><p>Daisy: You\u2019re hilarious. I can\u2019t be lusting after my cousin\u2019s husband.</p><p>Jules: What about his twin brother? She\u2019s not married to him, is she?</p><p>Daisy: Seriously? His twin brother\u2019s nice looking enough, I guess.</p><p>Jules: Which means you think he\u2019s handsome.</p><p>Daisy: Does not!</p><p>Jules: Daisy.</p><p>Daisy: Okay, so I find him, and not his twin brother, who\u2019s married to my cousin, attractive. Sue me. I swear, Jules, if you ever tell anyone, I\u2019ll strangle you through the screen.</p><p>Jules: Just attractive? Be honest.</p><p>Daisy: Fine. I think he\u2019s hot. Happy?</p><p>Jules: You have no idea. Where\u2019s my picture?</p><p>Daisy: I don\u2019t think I look like anyone famous...</p><p>Jules: If pictures make you uncomfortable, that\u2019s okay. I can wait.</p><p>Daisy: You\u2019re sweet, and yes, I\u2019d rather wait. What if what we look like doesn\u2019t do it for each other?</p><p>Jules: What if they did?</p><p>Daisy: I\u2019m a chicken. Anyway, I\u2019m sorry that you have bloody boring family business stuff. Sure I can\u2019t send some cupcakes to where you\u2019ll be going?</p><p>Jules: Like I said, I can wait. And I\u2019m positive. But seriously, Daisy, is there anything that can be done?</p><p>Daisy: Don\u2019t worry. It will all work out for the best.</p><p>After typing out their goodbyes, she leaned back in her office chair. The smile evaporated from her face as she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cConsider hiring a butler,\u201d Sebastian said as he stepped inside his twin\u2019s home and followed Christian down the hall. \u201cI had to wait an inordinate amount of time for you to answer the door.\u201d</p><p>His brother stopped mid-stride and turned to face him. \u201cDo you actually mean the things that come out of your mouth?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t in fact, but a lifetime of habits was hard to break. A lifetime of being on the defensive and striking first lay like a minefield between Sebastian and his goal.</p><p>At the moment, his goal was to be reinstated as President so life could resume as normal, with work that defined who he was. Or so he reminded himself before he had boarded one of Romanov Industries jets last night. Again, during his brief stay in New York City while he drank alone and stared out at the skyline, wishing he had Daisy with him, sharing the view. And yet again on the limo ride over and then a fourth time before knocking on his brother\u2019s front door and waiting.</p><p>Affecting a bored tone, he said, \u201cMerely trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, try starting out with, \u2018Hullo, Christian.\u2019 or \u2018A\u2019right mate?\u2019 Things of that nature.\u201d Christian moved to the living room and sat down. \u201cYou know, but for the occasional text, I haven\u2019t heard from you since our father\u2019s timely death. Thought you\u2019d forgotten about me.\u201d</p><p>Never. Despite Vladimir\u2019s best effort to teach Sebastian that he ought not miss Christian, or to even think about his twin. Their father was truly the most evil man to have roamed the planet.</p><p>\u201cMissed me, have you?\u201d Sebastian asked, glancing around. The room was quite cozy and warm, with pictures of family members everywhere. Surprisingly enough, several included him, though they weren\u2019t recent. In fact, they were of when he and Christian had been little, two or three years old at the most.</p><p>\u201cLike a toothache,\u201d his brother said in a cheerful tone that set Sebastian\u2019s teeth on edge.</p><p>Sebastian wandered to the fireplace, picked up a pirate-themed PEZ dispenser, and examined it. How long would his brother go on collecting these? With a shake of his head, he replaced the candy dispenser.</p><p>\u201cSee anything you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I were eight and female.\u201d Oh, that was bleeding brilliant. Here to make nice and he not only complained about time frames, but insults his brother\u2019s wife in the process.</p><p>Sebastian thrust his hands into his coat pockets and palmed the gift he\u2019d brought for Christian in one of them. He really should apologize to his brother.</p><p>As he was about to do just that, Christian shot him two fingers. \u201cSod off, Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWit at its finest,\u201d he snapped, falling into their normal routine of bickering. \u201cYou are bloody brilliant.\u201d</p><p>Christian tapped his fingers on his thigh, a sign he was irritated as hell. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian smirked. Some things, like irritating one\u2019s little brother, actually came naturally to him. \u201cWanted to make sure the in-laws hadn\u2019t carted you off to the middle of nowhere and left you for dead...y\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a blithering idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pretending to be you,\u201d Sebastian murmured. Casually, he placed an arm on the mantle and leaned against it, letting the Pez dispenser slide off his palm and onto the mantle.</p><p>\u201cEnglish, successful, handsome, and adored by millions? Don\u2019t kid yourself, because right now you\u2019re batting one for four,\u201d Christian shot back, sounding more American than ever. \u201cI\u2019ve read the London papers. The Board voted you out as President, because of\u2014and I quote\u2014your unpredictable behavior and unsettling financial schemes were making shareholders nervous. So you\u2019re here to make nice with me, look like a bloke who wants to sort out things with his family, all the while hoping the Board votes you back in. Predictable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting I be more like you? Perhaps a quickie Vegas wedding to make them forget my unpredictable behavior and unsettling financial schemes?\u201d Sebastian mocked.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian rubbed his chin. \u201cHave you anyone in mind? Liam suggested Kate, but we all know that\u2019s not going to happen. Ever,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe a relative of your wife\u2019s is in desperate financial trouble.\u201d Give me the excuse I need, he silently commanded, though I don\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d His brother\u2019s pale blue eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t be here if he weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>Before he could reply, his brother\u2019s wife, Zoe, rushed into the room. Coins jingled on the hem of her skirt. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d Brows furrowing, she glanced from Christian to Sebastian, then back at Christian again. \u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t tell us apart, love?\u201d Christian asked as he rose to his feet and crossed the room, pressing a kiss to her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing.\u201d She stood on tiptoe and kissed him back.</p><p>Feeling a bit awkward standing there, Sebastian adjusted his cufflinks. Though truth be told, he was massively happy for his brother.</p><p>After being the black sheep of the family for as long as their father was alive, Christian deserved someone who loved him unconditionally. Something Sebastian had failed to do. Weren\u2019t brothers supposed to support each other? He hadn\u2019t a clue, because once their mother left, Vladimir did everything in his power to pit Christian and Sebastian against each other. Successfully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was, in Sebastian\u2019s opinion, shameful.</p><p>Another woman walked in the room, dressed the opposite of his brother\u2019s wife in a conservative dress with sensible heels.</p><p>\u201cOh my word, Christian, you didn\u2019t tell us that your brother was visiting.\u201d She smiled and held out her hand, palm dropping. \u201cLeah Ambrose, mother of the bride.\u201d</p> <p>Staring at the woman, he raised his brows. \u201cCharmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Leah let her hand fall and curtsied. \u201cI\u2019m Leah Ambrose, mother of the bride, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand up, Momma.\u201d Zoe rushed forward and tugged on her mother\u2019s arm. \u201cHe\u2019s a \u2018my lord\u2019, not a \u2018Your Grace\u2019, and you don\u2019t have to curtsy.\u201d</p><p>His sister-in-law was correct, of course. Earl\u2019s were never addressed as Your Grace. Sebastian wished he were never addressed that way at all, and not because the newness of being an earl hadn\u2019t worn off. The whole damn title was tainted, because of his father\u2019s unstoppable greed.</p><p>\u201cThought it was a lovely \u2018Welcome to America\u2019 gesture,\u201d Sebastian said, shifting his weight to one side. \u201cBetter than the one I received earlier.\u201d</p> <p>Christian made a face.</p><p>\u201cDid you say mother of the bride?\u201d Sebastian asked, fully realizing what Leah had said.</p><p>Leah moved to Christian, patting his shoulder and flashing a proud smile. \u201cMy son-in-law is giving my daughter the wedding she deserves. Finally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma,\u201d Zoe said with an edge to her voice.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that the way to talk to your mother in front of royalty?\u201d</p><p>Zoe groaned, covering her eyes with a hand and peering through the slits between her fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s not royalty.\u201d</p><p>It had to be a trick of the light, because his brother practically had help me written all over his face and his eyes were pleading for Sebastian to do the rescuing.</p><p>\u201cI assume my lack of invitation was an oversight.\u201d Sebastian plucked an imaginary bit of lint off his coat sleeve as the two women quit arguing.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know what they say about assumptions,\u201d Christian said.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s heart sank a little, not that he should really care about a stupid piece of stationary, but he did. Enormously. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>His mother-in-law gasped. \u201cYou are certainly invited to their wedding,\u201d she cried, placing a dramatic hand on her chest.</p><p>At least Zoe\u2019s mother seemed to be on his side. \u201cI don\u2019t need an invitation, Mrs. Ambrose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall me Leah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah, I\u2019d consider it an honor to assist in any capacity.\u201d He sliced his gaze at Christian, whose help-me face had given way to what-the-hell-are-you-about face. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to propose something along the lines of best man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can shove your proposition up your arse,\u201d Christian growled. \u201cSit in the audience, on my side, if you like, but I\u2019ll be damned if you make a mockery of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll donate five million pounds to your Back to School organization. Surely there are loads of unfortunates around the world that could use B.T.S\u2019s services.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t buy your way into being the best man,\u201d Zoe said, her disdain apparent.</p><p>\u201cThe hell he can\u2019t.\u201d Christian strode to him and thrust out his hand. \u201cWelcome aboard, best man.\u201d A mischievous gleam entered his brother\u2019s eyes as they shook hands. \u201cAs such, it\u2019s your job to take care of the things I don\u2019t have the inclination to endure, like the menu for the reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Christian?\u201d Zoe crossed her arms. \u201cThat\u2019s so not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were my favorite son-in-law,\u201d Leah said, adopting the same pose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, hire a French chef and be done with it.\u201d There. That should help.</p><p>Two pairs of eyes glared at Sebastian, one green and the other blue. \u201cI\u2019m not firing Daisy Barnes,\u201d his sister-in-law said.</p><p>\u201cDaisy the baker, owns The Sweet Spot?\u201d he asked, the words slipping out before he could stop them. The trio blinked at him. \u201cMakes dreadful cupcakes.\u201d When lightening didn\u2019t strike him for that very awful lie, he relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s Daisy the caterer.\u201d A speculative look entered his brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhen did you sample her cupcakes?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s memories of his only two face-to-face meetings with Daisy washed over him, drowning him in her taste and scent. He cleared his throat. \u201cLast year, at Christmas time. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>Christian grunted, completely and transparently unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cI agree with my daughter, especially with the latest round of insurance bills that girl has to pay.\u201d Leah patted her hair and smoothed out her wrinkle-free dress. \u201cBless her heart\u2014I don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll manage to keep the business Kaye started. Stubborn little thing won\u2019t take any money to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, the two of you,\u201d Zoe pointed to him and Christian, \u201ccan discuss other things while we\u2019re gone. We\u2019re supposed to be at her place in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>A plan unfolded in his mind. Maybe he could help out Daisy with her insurance bills and she could help him out in return by posing as his fianc\u00e9e while he worked out how best to tell her who he was. \u201cActually, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Christian stopped him in the hallway, while the women were chatting about bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. \u201cWhat\u2019s in that head of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>His brother\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cDaisy\u2019s family. You can\u2019t just go in there and proposition her. She won\u2019t take your offer anyway. Zoe and I tried to give her money, but she wouldn\u2019t take it. Daisy actually thinks she\u2019ll find a way out.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s because Daisy had pride and determination. Only Jules knew her weaknesses. Only Jules knew she was actually worried. He could read through her texts and emails.</p><p>Sebastian adjusted his cufflinks, bowing his head a little so his brother couldn\u2019t read his face and discover all his secrets. Christian had a knack for that. \u201cShe\u2019s not my family. As for the other\u2014I can and I shall.\u201d Then he brushed past his brother, headed out the door, and got into the waiting limo.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Nothing could have prepared Daisy for the sight of him walking into her office. She blinked a couple of time to make sure she wasn\u2019t seeing things, or wishing that it were him and not his brother.</p><p>\u201cSebastian?\u201d Her heart thankfully waited until after she said his name to leap in her throat. He was here! He was back!</p><p>His chin ticked up as he drawled, \u201cI\u2019m here to sample the menu in lieu of the bride and groom, and make sure it\u2019s up to their standards.\u201d</p><p>He was a jerk! Her heart tumbled back to her chest, and then further to her toes. \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited,\u201d she said with a little twist to her lips.</p><p>Pale blue eyes narrowed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing exciting about food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, you\u2019ve been eating the wrong food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful.\u201d He unbuttoned his coat slowly, one dark button at a time. The very non-sexual act made her hot all over. Wearing a dark grey three-piece suit with a black shirt and tie underneath, there wasn\u2019t a strand of short blond hair out of place. \u201cTake care of this, will you?\u201d</p><p>An annoyed-as-hell simmer replaced the hot flash. What was wrong with him and what was wrong with her? The last time they\u2019d been in the same room, things had been easy. They\u2019d been sweet and vulnerable. Now all she wanted to do was kick him.</p><p>\u201cYou can hang it there.\u201d She pointed at the coat rack hanging on the wall behind him. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s the servants\u2019 day off, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYanks and their obsession with royalty,\u201d he complained as he hung up his coat and strode back to her. \u201cFifteen minutes ago, the bride\u2019s mother curtsied and addressed me as \u2018Your Grace\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to impress me, Your Lordship?\u201d she snapped. Horrified at her tone, she turned around and faced the window. Normally, she wasn\u2019t this snappy, mean, or downright ugly. Sure, she liked to tease and had teased him before, but now she sounded like a harpy and he sounded like a jerk.</p><p>His footsteps echoed lightly as he walked around her apartment. \u201cMost people would be entirely impressed,\u201d he said, his voice in her ear and she shivered. \u201cBut not you. And that impresses me.\u201d</p><p>Daisy didn\u2019t want to impress him. She wanted the other Sebastian back, the one she\u2019d met at Christmas. Lifting her chin, she whirled around.</p><p>Eyes the color of a winter sky threaded with drops of blue greeted her. His face was handsome as ever. Hollywood to die for handsome with sexy, full lips that made a woman sigh. Those perfectly sexy lips had made her sigh the first time he had come into her place and eaten cupcakes. Well, actually it had been the kiss he\u2019d given her that had made her sigh.</p><p>Heat crept up her neck and she forced her thoughts back to business. \u201cAre you ready to sample the menu?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIn a moment.\u201d Stepping back, he glanced around her office/bakery/apartment. \u201cDo you live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The studio apartment had been a godsend when she had to sell the house she\u2019d grown up in last year. The kitchen could be bigger, but it suited her needs for the time being. \u201cUntil the renovations downstairs are finished, I conduct business and cook in my apartment.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at the ceiling. \u201cNice lighting.\u201d Four skylights broke up the monotony of the very white drywall. \u201cVery nice lighting.\u201d He nodded at the queen-sized bed along the far wall. \u201cShall I sit there and let you serve me?\u201d</p><p>An image formed in her mind. One of her walking across the hardwood floors with a tray of desserts. Only when she reached him and offered her goodies, he threw the tray across the room and tackled her to the bed.</p><p>Oh my mercy. She had to stop. \u201cSo....\u201d She scooted around him and moved to the island in her kitchen. \u201cWhat do you want to sample first?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. Instead he circled her desk, reminding her of a Great White she\u2019d seen on Shark Week. \u201cIs this the final bill?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open as he picked up the letters from the insurance company and her lawyer. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d He read over the documents and then set them down. \u201cYour lawyer\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you got your law degree where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to be a solicitor to know this won\u2019t be in your favor, love,\u201d he said casually, as if he called women love all the time. As he\u2019d called her in the past. \u201cThe business will have to be sold. Insurance companies don\u2019t work for free.\u201d</p><p>Bristling at his know-it-all attitude, she picked up a sponge and began cleaning the already spotless countertop of the island. \u201cI didn\u2019t say they did.\u201d</p><p>Joining her, he selected a shrimp and avocado roll and ate it. \u201cFrom which culinary school did you learn your craft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a fancy diploma to know what tastes good.\u201d Shaking her head, she took a deep breath and tossed the sponge back into the sink.</p><p>She\u2019d walked right into that one. Before her mother had succumbed to stomach cancer, Daisy had dreamed of going to culinary school. But money had been tight and being an only child, she couldn\u2019t just leave her mother, not even with all the help and support she\u2019d received from her dad\u2019s side of the family.</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Instead of responding, she popped an avocado roll in her mouth and chewed until even the rice was pulverized. He snagged another piece of sushi, and then another, finishing off her lunch.</p><p>Now what was she supposed to eat? Now what was she supposed to say? Everything both of them said came out wrong. Well, at least for her it came out wrong. Who knew what he thought.</p><p>Crossing her arms, she frowned while he just looked at her.</p><p>And looked.</p><p>Sebastian was gobsmacked.</p><p>There was no other explanation for why he\u2019d stood for so long in the entrance of Daisy\u2019s apartment, simply drinking her in and saying nothing at all.</p><p>It was why he still stared at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, petal-pink lips moving in the most fascinating of ways.</p><p>Do you have any inkling at all who you are to me? Do you know I\u2019m dying inside to touch you, to kiss you, and to assure you I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make sure you never have to sell anything ever again just to get by? He wanted to say all of that, and much more, but he couldn\u2019t, else he\u2019d forfeit his right to ever talk to her again, even as Jules.</p><p>His gaze settled on her hair and he blinked. \u201cWhat happened to the bright orange?\u201d And why hadn\u2019t she told Jules? Perhaps it was because he was a man, he reminded himself.</p><p>\u201cGot tired of it,\u201d she said with a smile, and then her smile turned into a grin. \u201cYou didn\u2019t recognize me, huh? That\u2019s why you stood there with your mouth hanging open.\u201d</p><p>Damn, he\u2019d become rather fond of the orange. He\u2019d dreamed of her with orange hair. Of it sliding over his skin as she kissed him. \u201cYou fancy this color better?\u201d</p><p>Tentatively, she brushed a strand of hair behind a delicate ear. It reminded him of a seashell, perfectly formed. Although, he had never wanted to nibble on seashells. \u201cThis is my real color, well mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the bottom, it\u2019s all different colors,\u201d she said, her hazel eyes never leaving his. There was a connection between them, she had to feel it. He felt it; it had never left. \u201cPink, purple, green, and blue, but I\u2019m a brunette.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And how gorgeous you are, no matter the color.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d he began without thinking.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Daisy,\u201d she said, firmly. \u201cUse it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, I apologize,\u201d he murmured, his arms aching to hold her.</p><p>She gave him an odd look, and he wanted to leave. He was acting like a bumbling, bemused boy.</p><p>\u201cWell, now that we got my change in hair color out of the way, would you like to try what I fixed for Zoe and Christian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, following her to the island in the middle of her kitchen.</p><p>She made him a plate, placing bits of this and that on it.</p> <p>He ate without speaking. The fact that he was in her presence was enough for him. Well, almost. He was a man after all, and he wanted her. He wanted to touch and kiss her, but he couldn\u2019t walk into her apartment and say that, now could he?</p><p>\u201cEveryone around here loves chicken salad, and the fruit compote\u2014it\u2019s my great aunt Pearl\u2019s recipe,\u201d she said, describing the food. God, he missed her voice. It sounded as pleasing as ever. She stopped talking and looked at him expectantly.</p><p>Nod, he told his head. Fortunately, it listened.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been listening to a thing I said, have you?\u201d She poured a glass of water for him.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he admitted, taking a quick sip. He was parched, he realized. Most likely from nerves. Oh, if his mates could see him now. Anxious over a woman who barely knew he existed in the world.</p><p>Her eyes widened, and her cheeks pinkened. \u201cOh, okay. Um, so what did you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis menu seems a tad boring. You\u2019ll need to dazzle the guests at my brother\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t like anything?\u201d she asked, staring at him in obvious disbelief.</p><p>Oh God, he\u2019d hurt her feelings. He\u2019d rather slit his own throat than hurt her. \u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pasted on a smile, much like the one she\u2019d given him before. \u201cZoe said she wanted traditional southern, and that\u2019s what I made, but if you think the people who come won\u2019t like it, then I can try something different.\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell. There had to be a way he could fix this. He glimpsed a plate of sweets and his mouth began to water. \u201cThe cupcakes with the light brown icing look promising,\u201d he said, trying to repair the damage.</p><p>Wordlessly, she slid the plate in front of him.</p> <p>He picked up a cupcake and bit into it. Salty and sweet with a hint of savory hit his tongue, and he nearly moaned his appreciation. Sublime. Her cupcakes were sublime in every way. So was she.</p><p>\u201cLook, you can\u2019t expect to impress people with such simple fare, though if you fed them these, they\u2019d fall at your feet and worship you.\u201d He blinked at the expression on her face. \u201cWhat did I say wrong now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Her nose had scrunched up on one side and her brows had crashed together. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to leave, and please tell Zoe to come in person next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said around the last bite, and then wiped his hand on a cloth napkin decorated with green and silver squares. He might as well make a go of it, even knowing he had less of chance with her than with the Board. At least they were willing to reconsider restoring his position as President.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it involves you taking a really long walk off a really short pier into shark-infested waters, count me in,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>He fought back a grin. \u201cBloodthirsty little American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver consider it\u2019s people like you that made us bloodthirsty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d He brushed an errant crumb off a cuff link. \u201cPeople adore me.\u201d Well, people who weren\u2019t his brother, his cousin, his mother...or her, apparently. Actually, she adored him when he was conversing with her as Jules.</p><p>Jaw working, she looked nearly ready to bludgeon him to death. \u201cYou\u2019re demented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly, and in light of what I\u2019m about to propose, certifiably.\u201d Taking another drink of water, he looked straight into Daisy\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll pay off your insurance bill if you agree to pretend to be my fianc\u00e9e for a period of no longer than three months. Then we shall part as friends, with goals met.\u201d</p><p>It was perfect, really. He could have the best of both worlds this way, until he found a way to tell her the truth.</p><p>Hazel eyes rounded. \u201cWho told you about the bills in the first place? You didn\u2019t seem that shocked when you read the letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Aunt Leah, of course,\u201d he said, grateful the chatty woman had provided him with an airtight alibi.</p><p>Daisy crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cOf course she did,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cThink about it: all you\u2019d have to do is pose as my fianc\u00e9e for three months, and in return I\u2019ll pay off your insurance bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you get out of it?\u201d</p><p>You, he thought, I get to spend time with you. \u201cMy position as President of Romanov Industries. I\u2019m here to make nice with the brother, acquire a fianc\u00e9e, etcetera, so they will vote me back in. I won\u2019t bore you with the details.\u201d</p><p>Rounded eyes narrowed. \u201cTry anyway.\u201d</p><p>Clever girl. One should always know the specifics, and as he recalled that blustery winter day where she made him promise not to do anything to hurt Rose, she always wanted specifics. \u201cMy vice president, Liam Stewart, suggested fabricating a relationship to make me look more...stable. Quite Machiavellian of him, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d become reckless after his father\u2019s death by making shady deals with shady people, acting out of character in his personal life by making it public fodder, and worst of all, had for a brief period set out to destroy Romanov Industries from the inside. And he hadn\u2019t told anyone, not even the person that meant the most to him.</p><p>So much for the very untouchable golden child of Vladimir Romanov.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been myself for a while, and it wasn\u2019t good for Romanov\u2019s bottom line. We have shareholders to answer to, you know. So, I\u2019m out, until I\u2019ve proven myself to be different or rather the same.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Sometimes, I\u2019m not sure who they want me to be. Hell, I\u2019m not sure who I want to be,\u201d he added in a murmur, gazing off into the distance.</p><p>She stroked the sleeve of his suit jacket, bringing his attention back to her. \u201cBless your heart. I\u2019m sorry about your dad, by the way. Zoe said he\u2019d died in a boating accident a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>Her softly spoken words touched him while at the same time made him feel vulnerable. Without a computer or phone between them, he was awkward, something he\u2019d never been in his life. He shifted his weight from one leg to the other. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s what the Board wants, so that\u2019s what they\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m a means to an end,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>No, you are so much more. \u201cAs am I. This is mutually beneficial, lo\u2014er Daisy. I need your help with this bloody family business, so be quick about it. I have appointments to keep.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>God, were all British men like him? Daisy thought. Arrogant one minute\u2014nervous the next.</p><p>No, not all of them, she reminded herself. Jules was charming and funny...and nice. Christian and his cousin, Alexander, were both devoted to their wives, and actually carried on conversations without insults.</p><p>So it couldn\u2019t be a family trait.</p><p>It had to be because Sebastian had lost his ever-loving mind. Sure she felt bad for him, because he was obviously still suffering over losing his dad in a horrible explosion. She\u2019d felt that way when her momma had died, but at least she had her family and friends to help her get through it.</p><p>Still... fake engagement, and she should hurry up, because he had an appointment? She had no idea if this was the way he normally conducted business, but if it were, no wonder the Board voted him out.</p><p>\u201cTime\u2019s a-wasting,\u201d he said..</p><p>\u201cGo sodder yourself, Your Royal Pain in my Buttliness,\u201d Daisy snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bugger. Impossible to do to oneself, by the way, but I\u2019d be happy to demonstrate the technique on you,\u201d he said in his English accent that simultaneously annoyed and made her knees weak.</p><p>\u201cPart of your fake fianc\u00e9e package deal?\u201d</p><p>His chin dropped and his eyes grew dark. \u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish.\u201d Liar, liar, a little voice in her head mocked. Whatever his temperament, her body sure liked him, but no matter what, she wouldn\u2019t act on it, because what kind of woman was into a man like Sebastian Romanov?</p><p>\u201cWe are agreed then.\u201d He reached for the last cupcake. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>Making a noise that was a cross between a snort and a grunt, she transferred the food he hadn\u2019t eaten to plastic containers and stored them in her refrigerator. \u201cI didn\u2019t say yes.\u201d</p><p>There was no way she\u2019d say yes. Then again, maybe she should. After all, the insurance bill was hanging around her neck like an anchor, pulling her down and drowning her. However, making a deal with a man like Sebastian Romanov\u2014aristocratic, arrogant and aggravating as all get out\u2014was akin to dealing with the devil, but his money would solve so much.</p><p>Sighing as she closed the refrigerator door, she turned to face him and jumped. \u201cDon\u2019t sneak up on me like that.\u201d</p><p>Tapping on his very expensive watch, he said, \u201cI need an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight this second?\u201d she asked, stalling for time. She needed time to think, time to hash it out with someone who was reasonable and circumspect...and Jules. She needed to talk to Jules about it. Isabella and Haven, too. Wait, she couldn\u2019t. Bella was out of town and Haven would freak out.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so worried about?\u201d he asked, pulling her from her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to commit a crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fraud.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, it\u2019s not fraud. It\u2019s to be paid for services rendered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be lying per se. For all intents and purposes, we\u2019d actually be engaged for the duration.\u201d She opened her mouth to speak, but he held up a finger. \u201cTo sweeten the pot, I\u2019m willing to pay any and all future insurance bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were to agree, what would being your fianc\u00e9e require?\u201d she asked, trying to get all her ducks in a row, so when she talked to Jules, he could help her do a pros and cons list. Or tell her to run far, far away.</p><p>A confident smile kicked up the corners of his mouth, as if he already had the ring on her finger. \u201cNot much. Be my date at events, and actually go on dates to non-business events, royal get togethers and the like. You know, the usual things couples in love would do with each other.\u201d</p><p>Royal get-togethers? Her mind swam at the possibilities while her stomach did flips. No way she\u2019d fit in his life.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re an earl and I\u2019m not,\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>\u201cThe title isn\u2019t bestowed upon women.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve been keeping tabs on me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe just a little. \u201cUm, your brother lives here and we\u2019re practically related, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you reminded me,\u201d he said with a frown. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>What was so off-putting about being related to her? \u201cLook, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m what you need. You\u2019re like the twenty-first century version of Downton Abbey and I\u2019m a generation removed from the Dukes of Hazzard.\u201d</p><p>Confusion filled his icy blue eyes. \u201cThe what and what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, forget it.\u201d Jules would have totally gotten her comparison, and as soon as Sebastian left, she would fire off an email to Jules about this entire conversation instead of waiting until their usual time.</p><p>Placing a hand on Sebastian\u2019s suit jacket, she tried to explain herself further. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is\u2014we go together like peanut butter and\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014fish sticks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t eat peanut butter.\u201d Edging closer to her, his suit jacket brushed against her breasts. Dear God, he smelled good.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think people will see right through us?\u201d</p><p>His chin lowered a fraction. \u201cI think they\u2019ll like what they see\u2014aristocracy falling madly and completely in love with a commoner. Look at William and Catherine. The press adores them, as do members of the Board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about sex?\u201d she blurted, her cheeks heating and her hand falling away. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t expect sex. I mean, you\u2019re not paying me for sex. I don\u2019t have sex for money. Sex is free with me.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop saying \u2018sex\u2019 and there was no one around to duct-tape her mouth shut. \u201cBut we\u2019re not a real couple, so our sex would be fake sex.\u201d</p><p>His arms came around her then.</p><p>She took a step back, hitting the cold front of the fridge. Bracing a palm along each side of her, he dipped his head. Her heart sped up until it beat so hard and fast that she had to take in great gulps of air.</p><p>\u201cI prefer the real thing, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice sounding nothing like it usually did. Her gaze fell to his lips, full and totally kissable when they weren\u2019t stretched into a thin line. In fact, right now they were parted and oh so dangerously close. Tempting. \u201cBut not with you. I mean, I don\u2019t know you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou could get to know me,\u201d he said and her eyes rounded, but she didn\u2019t move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Time seemed to stand still. His lips seemed to draw closer and his eyes became all slumberous. Heat spread through her, languorous waves that made her want to touch him, to see if he felt it too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good idea,\u201d she said. Her breasts ached. They felt heavy and she wanted his hands on her. Oh God, she was a hussy. A slave to her lust, all over a man she\u2019d only met twice before, yet wanted to jump as soon as she\u2019d seen him. All three times.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a very good thing I\u2019m of the same opinion.\u201d He stood, letting his hands fall away. \u201cI\u2019ll transfer half of the amount you require to your account within the hour. The rest will be transferred upon the ending of our engagement. Afterwards, you will notify me should more bills suddenly appear and I\u2019ll make them go away.\u201d</p> <p>Make them go away? God, it must be nice to have that kind of power and freedom. \u201cNow what do we do?\u201d she asked, slipping past him. Her skin felt overheated. She poured herself a glass of water and drank greedily.</p><p>Tilting his head to one side, he let his eyes roam her body. Her nipples tightened and desire pooled in her belly, spreading low between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cWe pretend to fall in love. I\u2019ll be by Wednesday for your answer, and to sample your next menu offering. Think tropical.\u201d With that, he strode to her door and grabbed his coat along the way.</p><p>\u201cAnd Daisy,\u201d he asked, pausing at the door.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have kissed you, if you\u2019d asked me.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to wipe away the smug smile that appeared on his face. \u201cGuess you\u2019ll never be kissing me then, because I will never ask you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, his smile fell. She blinked and it was back, maybe her imagination had wished it had fallen. \u201cNever say never.\u201d Then he opened the door and left, letting the door close softly behind him.</p><p>\u201cOh God, oh God, oh God,\u201d she chanted, rushing to her phone. Forget emailing Jules. She had to talk to him now.</p><p>Sebastian glanced at his phone as it buzzed and climbed inside the limo.</p><p>Daisy: Are you there? Do you have a minute or five million?</p> <p>Jules: All my time belongs to you.</p><p>Daisy: You\u2019re not a Duke or something, are you?</p><p>He grunted. Oh, he was something all right, but Jules would only answer her Duke question.</p><p>Jules: Not for at least thirty more years.</p><p>His mother\u2019s father was bound to live for at least that many years, and Vladimir had made the Duke of Everham sign a binding contract that his title and the estates would go to him upon his death. Only Vladimir was dead and Westmoreland was still kicking.</p><p>Rather poetic justice, Sebastian thought.</p><p>Daisy: Good.</p><p>Jules: Why?</p> <p>The text bubble had the ... in it while she typed.</p><p>Daisy: I met someone.</p><p>Jules: Should I be jealous?</p><p>Daisy: No, kittenpartybasketbagel</p><p>He made a face. What the hell was that?</p><p>Jules: What the hell was that?</p><p>Daisy: Ugh. Autocorrect. Can I call you? It would be easier.</p><p>Oh hell no. She\u2019d hear his voice, recognize him, accuse him of being a liar (rightly so), and never speak to him again. There was no way he could let that happen.</p><p>Jules: Sorry, darling, but I\u2019m actually in a meeting.</p><p>His driver opened his door, and he got out, heading inside a chain restaurant on the outskirts of town. Some meeting he was having.</p><p>Daisy: OMG. I\u2019m so sorry.</p><p>He smiled. Now that he\u2019d heard her voice again, he could actually hear her saying the words.</p><p>Jules: No worries.</p><p>Daisy: Talk to you later?</p><p>Jules: Of course. I\u2019ll text you ASAP.</p><p>Daisy: Jules?</p><p>He sighed. Whenever she typed his name like that, she had something serious to ask or tell him.</p><p>Jules: Yes?</p><p>Daisy: I like it when you call me darling or love. Just wanted you to know.</p><p>He frowned. Yet, Sebastian wasn\u2019t allowed to call her anything but her given name. Why should he? Sebastian didn\u2019t know Daisy, not like Jules did. But he was also Jules, so he did in fact know her as well as Jules did.</p><p>\u201cOh good God,\u201d he muttered. He was becoming jealous of himself.</p><p>Jules: Laters, darling.</p><p>He took extreme satisfaction typing that last word out before pocketing his phone. Sebastian Romanov might be on the outs with the sexy little caterer, but Jules Westmoreland sure as hell wasn\u2019t, and he would use that to his advantage.</p><p>\u201cStill no butler,\u201d Sebastian said with a frown as his brother greeted him at the door.</p><p>Christian raised his brows. \u201cYour powers of observation are truly frightening.\u201d He gestured for Sebastian to come inside. \u201cNow that you\u2019re back, maybe you can help me with something.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian followed his brother into the living room. \u201cDiffusing the situation between your bride and her mother not enough?\u201d</p><p>Turning to face Sebastian, Christian gave him a look. \u201cYou only helped, because it served your purpose.\u201d</p><p>Removing his coat, he draped it over a large, flowered chair by the fireplace and sat down. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t pretend you did me any favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did do you a favor.\u201d</p><p>His brother\u2019s mouth opened and shut. Taking a deep breath, Christian moved to stand beside the fireplace mantle. \u201cDoing me a favor was still self-serving.\u201d</p><p>Why did it bloody matter what the purpose was or who it served? \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>Christian rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cGood to know some things don\u2019t change.\u201d He picked up the Owl Whistle Pez Dispenser and held up to the light. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you\u2019d care to share how this suddenly appeared in my collection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your predicament\u2014magically appearing candy dispensers? How incredibly wonderful that\u2019s your only pressing problem in life.\u201d His brother peered at him, identical blue eyes growing frosty as a winter morning in St. Petersburg as Sebastian\u2019s insult hit its mark. \u201cTruly fascinating.\u201d</p><p>An evil grin lit Christian\u2019s face. \u201cIt was you.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, but claiming ownership didn\u2019t signify in the greater scheme of things. Sebastian loosened his tie. \u201cAny Russian Standard in your cupboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. You\u2019re not getting out of this.\u201d Christian carefully placed the dispenser back on the mantle and clapped his hands, briskly rubbing them together. \u201cI thought Vlad had destroyed my entire collection, right after Francesca left him. Thank you for returning it to me.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian remembered the day well, though he chose to keep the memory locked away, but his damned brother had a way of making him remember all those things best left in the past.</p><p>All of twelve, Sebastian hadn\u2019t shown a lick of emotion when Lady Francesca had tearfully kissed and hugged her sons good-bye. He hadn\u2019t hugged her back, merely stood there in his Eton uniform and had told her to take an umbrella for the storm on its way.</p><p>Utter drivel he\u2019d spouted. As for the events that had eventually followed...</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Christian said, pulling Sebastian out of his bitter memories. \u201cCan\u2019t you be human for once?\u201d He slammed his fist on the mantle. Crystal fairies clinked together and Pez dispensers toppled over. \u201cStop pretending nothing bothers you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pretending.\u201d He couldn\u2019t to let anything bother him. Hell, he\u2019d been trained from birth to be the perfect, non-temperamental golden child.</p><p>\u201cFuck it.\u201d Slashing his hand in the air, his brother\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cAre congratulations in order for you and Daisy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will be.\u201d Sebastian would fly to New York City tomorrow just for the hell of it. Just to make anyone who was tailing him think that he was shopping for jewelry. Only he didn\u2019t need to shop for a ring. He\u2019d already purchased it, before he\u2019d left England, with Daisy in mind.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you went through with it and talked her into your mad plan as well.\u201d Christian shook his head. \u201cGod help Daisy Barnes, and God help you if you hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an adult, fully aware of the lack of emotions I possess.\u201d Gazing into the fireplace, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a business transaction, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know Vladimir Romanov\u2019s legacy lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so bloody different? You married Zoe to improve your image,\u201d he snapped, without thinking. Well, that wasn\u2019t entirely true. His twin had fallen in love with Zoe and married her\u2014in Vegas of all places.</p><p>Though they\u2019d gotten off to a dreadful start, with Christian and Sebastian\u2019s father\u2019s interference in the marriage, his brother and Zoe had gotten through it.</p><p>And because his brother was so enamored with his wife, he was giving her a real wedding, with all the pomp and ceremony she could ever want.</p><p>Firelight and disgust highlighted Christian\u2019s face. \u201cI should kick your arse out, but\u2014and it pains me greatly to say it\u2014you are more than welcome to sleep in our guest room.\u201d</p><p>It might have pained his brother to say it, but it shocked the hell out of Sebastian to hear it. \u201cThank you, and I apologize for my thoughtless words. It\u2019s been a rather trying few months.\u201d</p><p>His brother gave him a look, as if he had expected him to say something different, which in the past would have been the truth. Finally, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d Christian strode out of the room and down a hallway.</p><p>Sebastian heard a door opening, and then laughter as the door closed.</p><p>Sinking back in the chair, he crossed one leg at the ankle and rubbed the back of his neck. He supposed he could have admitted that he had given his brother the candy dispenser, but then he\u2019d have to explain how it wasn\u2019t actually Christian\u2019s, but his\u2014the one that hadn\u2019t been tossed out with the rubbish.</p><p>Both of them used to collect the silly dispensers, but Sebastian hadn\u2019t been the one to anger their father enough to ransack a room and throw away everything he held dear.</p><p>In any other circumstances, twins should have found solace in one another, bulwarks against the madness of Vladimir and his schemes. Unfortunately for both of them, that hadn\u2019t happened.</p><p>At least he had Romanov Industries. Or he used to have Romanov Industries.</p><p>The floor creaked and he glanced up.</p><p>His brother\u2019s wife stood in front of him, with a small smile on her face. \u201cThank you for giving his owl whistle back. It\u2019s the only one I hadn\u2019t been able to find.\u201d</p><p>Damn, his twin was a lucky bloke. \u201cSomething the two of you do for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you care about your brother.\u201d</p><p>Perceptive woman, but he wasn\u2019t inclined to agree with her out in the open. \u201cI\u2019m here to make nice so I can be President of Romanov Industries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d Zoe\u2019s eyes were dark, darker than Daisy\u2019s, but their hair color and build were nearly identical.</p><p>\u201cHow exactly are you related to Daisy Barnes? She said your dad\u2019s her uncle.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at his change in subject. \u201cMy dad and her mother are...were brother and sister. Aunt Kaye died of stomach cancer a few years back. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t done a background check on her yet.\u201d</p><p>Trust Christian to spill all Sebastian\u2019s secrets to his wife, but he couldn\u2019t really blame him. Pulling out his iPhone, he waved it at Zoe. \u201cWaiting and ready to be read,\u201d he said dismissively, and then slipped it back in his pocket. There was no reason for a background check on a woman he already knew everything about. Besides, he wanted to be left alone at his pity-party for one. \u201cRiveting information, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>A thick sigh left Zoe. \u201cWell, good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d he said, but she didn\u2019t leave. For God\u2019s sake, what would he have to say to get her to leave him in peace? \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have donated the money if Christian had said no?\u201d</p><p>He already donated money to B.T.S., but no one knew and he intended for it to stay that way. \u201cIt\u2019s worthwhile organization, despite being headed by him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d Shaking her head, she sighed again. How in the hell did his brother put up with her sighs? \u201cI hope it\u2019s worth it, in the end, when you\u2019re all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that very heart-warming platitude.\u201d Rising to his feet, he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be off to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d she said as he left the room.</p><p>He grabbed his overnight bag and climbed the stairs. Opening the door to the guest room, he went inside and placed his bag on the dresser, then pulled out his phone and texted Liam.</p><p>Staying at Christian\u2019s. Daisy has all but agreed.</p><p>Liam\u2019s response was swift and to the point, something Sebastian had admired about his friend for years.</p><p>Excellent news. Pictures?</p><p>Of course. Paparazzi would go mad for even a hint that he was seeing someone.</p><p>Will have to you in 15. Send to usual contacts.</p><p>By morning, the London papers would have him and Daisy linked together. Hell, he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they weren\u2019t calling for an engagement before the weekend. Perhaps he should consider heading it off, or would it be better to play it close to the vest? Shouting his love and adoration for Daisy would be a dead giveaway of the farce, mostly due to the fact that he did not shout his love and adoration for anything.</p><p>Quickly, he made a mental list of all the events Daisy could attend as his fianc\u00e9e. Taking her home with him was absolutely necessary. Maybe there, on his own turf, he could confess all to her.</p><p>Rolling his shoulders, he attempted to relieve the pent-up tension. What he wouldn\u2019t give for a round with his bodyguard, Ivan. The man didn\u2019t care in the least what title Sebastian held and tried to beat the shit out of him every time they sparred. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tapping his fingers against his thigh, he glanced up and then at his phone, noting the time. He had several hours before he had to be back at the airport. Although, he could have left earlier and slept on his jet. Then again, he wouldn\u2019t have been photographed driving to his brother\u2019s home.</p><p>Still, the tension was driving him mad.</p><p>He canted his head side to side, rolled his shoulder again, and then gave up. Tension wasn\u2019t the worst of his problems, not by a long shot.</p> <p>His phone buzzed.</p><p>Daisy: Jules, are you around? Can I call you?</p><p>Jules: No, I\u2019m in the...</p><p>Where the hell could he be that didn\u2019t allow chatting on the phone?</p><p>Jules: the library, reading about the history on the house I bought in Cheam.</p> <p>Daisy: Oh, fun! I love the library. Sure Google is easier, but there\u2019s something about holding the real thing in your hands.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t agree more. He\u2019d rather be holding her than this phone in his hands as they talked.</p><p>Daisy: Wow. Your library is open late!</p><p>Oh hell. He\u2019d forgotten about the time difference between them.</p><p>Jules: It\u2019s near a university\u2014students and the like use it.</p><p>Daisy: That\u2019s nice. Okay, so you swear to keep a secret and an open mind?</p> <p>Jules: Yes.</p><p>Daisy: I had a guy proposition me today, and I need your advice.</p><p>Jules: What?!</p><p>Daisy: Not like that!</p><p>Jules: What did Isabella and Haven say?</p><p>Daisy: I didn\u2019t tell them. Bella\u2019s gone out of town for the next couple of days and needs to concentrate of engagement stuff. Haven would freak out, and that\u2019s not helpful.</p><p>This ought to be interesting.</p><p>Jules: Go on.</p> <p>Daisy: Funny thing...So, you know that picture you sent me of your celebrity look-alike?</p><p>He did remember, and he remembered her response as well. She thought he was hot. Him. Sebastian Romanov, and not his brother.</p><p>Daisy: Well, his twin brother showed up out of nowhere, all weird and stuck up about my hair color and my food, and then proceeded to ask me to be his fake fianc\u00e9e so he can get his company back. He said he\u2019d pay me for it.</p><p>Well, that certainly was one way of looking at their meeting.</p><p>Jules: Did you tell him to get the hell out?</p><p>Daisy: No.</p><p>Jules: Why not?</p><p>Daisy: He\u2019ll pay off my mother\u2019s insurance bills and any future bills if I do, but...</p><p>Jules: But what?</p><p>Daisy: I\u2019d have to lie to everyone about our relationship. I don\u2019t know if I can do it. I\u2019d feel like a prostitute or something.</p><p>Jules: Are you exchanging sex for money?</p><p>Daisy: Seriously, Jules?</p><p>Jules: Sorry, but if all this bloke wants is for you to pretend to be his fianc\u00e9e and nothing more for money that would make your problems go away...honestly, I fail to see how this is a problem.</p><p>Yeah, he was a selfish bastard, but dammit, he wanted to help her. He wanted her. This was his only chance to accomplish both goals.</p><p>Daisy: So you think it\u2019s okay? You won\u2019t think less of me for agreeing? I mean, there will most likely be pictures and it might show us all lovey-dovey or something.</p><p>Jules: Yes, I do. No, I won\u2019t. And unless you\u2019re madly attracted to the bloke, I\u2019ve nothing to worry about, do I?</p><p>Nothing appeared for a while, but the ... while she typed, erased, and retyped. He blinked and the fine hair on his neck stood. Was she really that attracted to him?</p><p>Daisy: Beyond his looks and body, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inside of Sebastian Romanov that could keep my interest. I\u2019d rather have you, Jules. Any day.</p><p>He supposed he should be happy that she was choosing him over him, but he wasn\u2019t. He wanted her to like him as Sebastian, too.</p><p>Jules: I was never worried.</p><p>Daisy: So what should I do to get the upper hand? He strikes me as the type who likes to be in charge of EVERYTHING.</p><p>\u201cOh, I do, darling,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>Jules: Maybe flirt with him a little, tease him, and stroke his ego (and only his ego).</p><p>Daisy: But that\u2019s what I do to you, or at least try to do. *blush*</p><p>His heart beat wildly in his chest. Did she now?</p><p>Jules: Did you do that to him?</p><p>Daisy: No, he was too busy ordering me to make a decision because he had more important people to see. *eye roll*</p><p>Jules: Try it, see how he responds. If it doesn\u2019t work, then we\u2019ll regroup and try a different tact so you feel comfortable.</p><p>Daisy: All right. I\u2019ll try it your way. Night, Jules.</p><p>Jules: Good night, darling.</p><p>Letting the phone fall to the bed, he scrubbed a hand over his face. He was bloody tired of this charade already and he\u2019d been here less than a day. However, once he got back from New York, nothing would stop him from charming the hell out of Daisy Barnes.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Daisy sat outside on a wrought iron and wood bench, eating her lunch. The sun shone cheerfully in the sky and the unseasonably warm weather should have made her happy.</p><p>Key words: should have</p><p>Only Jules\u2019s advice had her all irritated. She didn\u2019t want to flirt with Sebastian, or tease him, or any of the things she did with Jules. It felt wrong, but her stupid body got all happy about it. Even her brain got in on the action last night, and made her have a dream about the arrogant earl.</p><p>He\u2019d kissed her everywhere she\u2019d always wanted to be kissed. He\u2019d turned her over and made her hold on to the frame of the bed while he whispered how beautiful she was, how out of control she made him feel.</p><p>If only she\u2019d never kissed him under the mistletoe. If only she didn\u2019t know how nice he could be when he wanted. If only she knew what to believe about him.</p><p>If, if, if.</p><p>She took a savage bite out of her defenseless sandwich, rolling her head side to side to ease the tension in her neck.</p><p>Her phone vibrated, and her heart leapt into her throat.</p><p>\u201cJules,\u201d she murmured as she picked it up.</p><p>I\u2019m on my way. Be there \u2013S</p><p>She frowned. Of course it was him and not Jules. Just her luck. Zoe must have given him her cell phone number. According to the card that had come with the huge flower bouquet he\u2019d sent her, he\u2019d been in New York City, conducting business.</p><p>Thanks for the heads up, Your Lordship. ~D</p><p>After replying to Sebastian, she sent a quick text to Jules. I already suck at this. One text and I\u2019ve gone all harpy on him.</p><p>Jules: Everyone gets a mulligan. Try again. Remember\u2014if you agree, then all your bills are gone.</p><p>\u201cStupid insurance bills,\u201d she muttered, but Jules was right. Sebastian Romanov was a gift from Heaven. Or at least his money was.</p><p>\u201cStupid what?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes snapped open, mortified to find her ex, Glen, and his new girlfriend, Nina, staring at her with twin expressions of look-at-the- single-and-talking-to-herself-crazy woman.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She set her lunch to the side and took a drink of water, before standing and brushing off her skirt. \u201cHow are y\u2019all doing?\u201d</p><p>A little dog with beady eyes stuck his head out of Nina\u2019s purse and Daisy stifled a scream.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scare Jelly Belly,\u201d Nina admonished, stroking the brown rat on the head.</p><p>\u201cSorry I wasn\u2019t expecting that\u2014it, er, him?\u201d</p><p>Jelly Belly growled at Daisy.</p><p>Nina frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s a girl. Can\u2019t you see the diamond collar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Sorry. Where\u2019s Cici?\u201d</p><p>Glen wouldn\u2019t meet her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s, um...now don\u2019t get mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do with my dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave her to my mother.\u201d</p><p>Daisy\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>Nina patted Daisy\u2019s arm. \u201cJelly-Belly and Cici couldn\u2019t get along, so Glen thought his mother would love the company, since she\u2019s all by herself.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m all by myself, Daisy wanted to shout, but didn\u2019t. Pride made her keep that thought to herself. Instead, she jerked away from Nina and fixed her eyes on Glen. \u201cHow could you do something like that, without talking to me first?\u201d</p><p>Glen gave her a tight smile. \u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome to go over to there and take Cici from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right. You want me to take some little old lady\u2019s dog from her and say what?\u201d Daisy threw her hands in the air. There was no way she could go to Glen\u2019s mother and take Cici away. Cici loved that woman more than Daisy and Glen combined, and she was by herself. Her son only visited her on Sundays, after church, so he could get some home cooking.</p><p>Still, it hurt.</p><p>Tears pricked at the back of her eyes and her throat grew tight. \u201cGod, you\u2019re an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow Glen, I thought you said Daisy was fine with us giving Cici to your momma,\u201d Nina said and Daisy blinked, tears thankfully staying at bay.</p><p>\u201cGlen says lots of things,\u201d Daisy said before Glen could lie to the poor woman even more.</p><p>Nina shook her head, her brow furrowing. \u201cNow Daisy, that\u2019s hardly productive. Maybe we can all get together for dinner one night and work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a great idea, sweetie,\u201d Glen said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I agree with Glen.\u201d</p><p>Instead of looking disappointed, Nina smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s a step in the right direction, you two. Maybe one day we can all be friends and do something together again. Glen really misses your friendship, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Eyes widening, Daisy took a step back, wishing for someone to come save her. She should just save herself and leave, but she had a feeling they would follow her inside. \u201cSoooo, what brings you out here today?\u201d</p><p>Glen and Nina looked at each other and grinned, then back at Daisy. Nina\u2019s arm shot out and punched her. Well, not punched her, but the woman came pretty darn close as she wiggled her fingers at Daisy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re engaged!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEngaged?\u201d Daisy\u2019s gaze slid from the ginormous diamond ring to Glen\u2019s face. His brown eyes crinkled as he smiled at her. This was almost too surreal.</p><p>Glen was supposed to have married her. Glen supposedly couldn\u2019t afford to get married for at least five more years. Seems like Glen had lied about a lot, more than she ever suspected.</p><p>And finding out hurt more than she ever expected.</p><p>Unable to take his smile, she forced her attention to the woman beside him.</p><p>Nina nodded, taking the dog out of her purse and kissing it on the head. \u201cJelly Belly will be the flower girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the best, most precious flower girl ever,\u201d Nina added in high-pitched baby voice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked.\u201d Glen wrapped an arm around Nina. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t wait to share the news with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two walked down here just to tell me, your ex-girlfriend, that y\u2019all are engaged?\u201d Of all the nerve. Who did that?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pout, Lazy-Daisy,\u201d Glen said with a laugh and she ground her teeth together. \u201cWe want to hire you to cater our wedding reception\u2014June twelfth, by the way. So mark your calendar.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she wanted to mark something all right.</p><p>\u201cI told my Nina-Bina that if Holland Springs only caterer was good enough for a Hollywood movie star, then she was perfect for us,\u201d he added.</p><p>Was that ass-backward compliment supposed to make her jump up and down for joy? Did it really matter? This was more business for her. Money was money, even from name-rhyming used-to-be boyfriends who had promised forever, especially since she hadn\u2019t agreed to Sebastian\u2019s offer.</p><p>Swallowing her pride, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, I cannot allow you to over-extend yourself like that,\u201d Sebastian said as joined the threesome. \u201cSorry for my tardiness, love, but my meeting with the Prime Minister\u2014never mind\u2014boring business stuff that shouldn\u2019t have too much of an effect on the American economy.\u201d He gave her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cFull disclosure\u2014I planned a holiday in France, at the Chateau le Camarguais, for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was to be a surprise,\u201d he added. \u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>Her draw dropped open and somehow she managed to close it. Then she realized everyone was looking at her, awaiting her response. \u201cSure,\u201d she croaked, and then cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d Nina breathed, unable to take her eyes off Sebastian. Not that Daisy could blame the woman. Wearing a dark blue, three-piece suit and a smile, Sebastian looked dashing and charming. \u201cAnd very French sounding. Oui, oui!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a marvelously entertaining woman you are,\u201d Sebastian said, reducing Nina to a giggling mess. \u201cI suspect you and your fiance communicate for hours by merely gazing into one another\u2019s eyes. Adoringly, of course. Brain empty of every rational thought. Or any thought for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan someone tell me what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Glen asked. \u201cI thought you were getting married to Zoe Ambrose for the third or fourth time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my brother, Christian. He\u2019s giving his wife the wedding she always wanted. Something a man who adores his wife should do. A man that would never dally with another woman, or take her dog.\u201d</p><p>Daisy\u2019s gaze flew to Sebastian. How did he know about that?</p><p>Glen shifted his stance to one side. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone around here knows Daisy needs the money to pay the insurance company. Thought I\u2019d help her out.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks grew hot, even as her body turned cold. \u201cGee, thanks, Glen.\u201d Wavering between punching her ex in the throat and making him a groom\u2019s cake in the shape of the middle finger, she glanced longingly at the door.</p><p>Sebastian moved closer to her ex. \u201cThought you\u2019d pop down to Daisy\u2019s shop and give her some charity? Flash some diamonds and make her work for it?\u201d Leaning in to Glen, he said, \u201cFeel like a real man now, yeah? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somewhere between one and thirty seconds ago, her arrogant earl had turned into a London wanna-be brawler. Something she read about once in a romance novel. Okay, so she\u2019d read that baby until it had become dog-eared.</p><p>Glen sputtered, \u201cAh...no. I mean yes... Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you leave,\u201d Sebastian growled and Jelly Belly whined, shaking her tail. The dog looked as though she wanted Sebastian to pet her. \u201cAnd your little rat, too.\u201d</p> <p>Nina let out a horrified gasp. \u201cWhy I never!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you have,\u201d Sebastian snapped.</p><p>Yeah, this was not going to end well. Grabbing Sebastian\u2019s arm, Daisy said, \u201cLet\u2019s get you something to eat.\u201d She shot Nina and Glen an apologetic smile. \u201cHungry always equals grumpy, you know.\u201d</p><p>The couple hurried away, giving them both odd looks over their shoulders.</p><p>Good riddance, Sebastian thought. He turned his attention to Daisy. \u201cI am not hungry.\u201d</p> <p>She tilted her head to one side. \u201cHow did you know Glen was my ex? And how did you know he took my dog?\u201d</p><p>Oh hell. Think, dammit, think. \u201cYour conversation carried.\u201d</p><p>Glancing down, she wiggled a foot. \u201cThat\u2019s not embarrassing at all.\u201d</p><p>He gently hooked a finger under her chin and applied a bit of pressure so she\u2019d look at him. Her hazel eyes were shiny and there was a tell-tale blush on her cheeks. \u201cNever be embarrassed with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know you,\u201d she said softly, her lashes fluttering down.</p><p>\u201cLike I said before, get to know me,\u201d he said, his thumb stroking the line of her jaw. She trembled and so did he. Unable to help himself, he dipped his head and brushed his lips over hers. Her hands came between them, pressing on his chest.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>\"You can.\" He kissed her again. \"One more kiss, Daisy.\"</p><p>Mouth trembling, she kissed him back. Soft, chaste, and so sweet that he melted inside, even as she melted in his arms. If only they were inside right now.</p><p>Deepening the kiss, he teased her mouth open and slid his tongue inside. She gasped and he slanted his head, fitting his lips more firmly to hers as his hands came up to cup her face. She tasted of honey and mint. She tasted exactly how he\u2019d dreamed she would, and yet no dream could ever do justice to the taste of Daisy.</p><p>Her fingers curled into him, pulling tight on his suit jacket. \u201cSebastian, please,\u201d she whispered again his lips. \u201cPlease, stop. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>He was going too fast for her, and they were in public. \u201cGet to know me, Daisy.\u201d Pressing a kiss to the corner of her mouth, he smiled. \u201cI promise I\u2019m not that bad, once you get past all the prickly stuff.\u201d</p><p>She pushed him back and looked up at him, the tips of her fingers pressed to her mouth. Her breasts rose and fell rapidly. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kiss me again,\u201d she choked out, her eyes swimming with tears. Tears that he knew he\u2019d somehow caused.</p> <p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d he snapped, close to his breaking point. Jesus Christ, he hated this. He\u2019d kissed her with a passion borne of late night chats and constant emails. Of shared nightmares and midnight confessions. Of dreams and wants that each had sworn to only to share with the other.</p><p>He\u2019d kissed her like he loved her, like he knew her, because he did.</p><p>Yet she felt none of it.</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s someone else I\u2019m saving my kisses for,\u201d she whispered, and ran inside.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Sebastian started after her, then froze as a crew of constructions workers came through the door, cutting on the radio and resuming their work. The sounds of music, hammer, and saws filled his ears, but it still felt as if every eye were on him.</p><p>He stood there a good five minutes before it hit him\u2014Daisy was saving her kisses for Jules, for him.</p><p>Victory roared and just as swiftly, his rational side reminded him that to Daisy, he was Sebastian, and she didn\u2019t want his kisses. Thank you very much.</p><p>However, he was a Romanov, and Romanovs went after what they wanted. And he wanted Daisy. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d he muttered, then dashed up the stairs and into her flat where he found her bent over a portable table.</p><p>She was sketching. It looked to be a wedding cake and she was quite brilliant at it. Hell, he wanted to eat it. Then again, he had the most annoying sweet tooth and she made the most spectacular desserts.</p><p>The tip of her pencil broke. \u201cYou would,\u201d she muttered, then glanced up. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for kissing you, without your permission,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven; just don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>He supposed he should be thankful that she didn\u2019t make him promise not to kiss her again, because he had every intention of doing so. \u201cIs that for my brother\u2019s wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Studying her design, he said, \u201cYou could bring out the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I give you pointers on world domination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoonshine could be the official drink, to pay tribute to your family.\u201d</p><p>Hazel eyes crinkled at the corner. \u201cSo you do know who the Dukes of Hazzard County are.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stay mad at him. A point her favor, and in his since he was the beneficiary of her benevolence.</p><p>\u201cBoredom struck last night. I bought the series, as one does.\u201d</p><p>Her head dipped as she sketched, adding more flowers to the second tier. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t hire the actors to come to your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he snapped, and then clamped his jaw shut.</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cI was teasing you, Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>Like Jules had told her to do. \u201cNoted.\u201d Placing his hands behind his back, he wandered around her flat. \u201cMay I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if it isn\u2019t an insult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather narrow parameters you\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she placed her pencil to the side. \u201cJust ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you made up your mind, or did our impromptu kiss persuade you not to take my offer?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, small and tight. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t ask who the other man was, then again, you don\u2019t concern yourself with stuff like that, do you? You probably expect me to break up with him and be with you, because it\u2019s on your to-do list.\u201d</p><p>Ordinarily, yes, but this was no ordinary circumstance. Everything was on the line. \u201cOkay, who\u2019s the other man, and when can I meet him?\u201d</p><p>Her face paled, and then turned red. \u201cHis name is Jules, and you can\u2019t, because he doesn\u2019t live around here.\u201d</p><p>He kept his expression neutral, despite never being happier at being categorized as the other man. \u201cSure you\u2019re not making him up?\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not sure?\u201d</p><p>One cheek hallowed. Oh yeah, he\u2019d ticked her off. She was chewing on the inside of her mouth. A bad habit he\u2019d once told her to stop. \u201cHe\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you he doesn\u2019t live around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem for me. I own a jet.\u201d</p><p>She chewed harder and he inwardly winced. She really needed to stop. \u201cDid you ever think that maybe I didn\u2019t enjoy kissing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cGod, you\u2019re conceited.\u201d</p><p>Guilty. \u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d He took a step closer to her. \u201cYou enjoyed every minute of our kiss. In fact, I\u2019d bet you\u2019d like to do it again.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI would not,\u201d she said faintly, but the lie was loud in her tone.</p><p>He smiled, confident as he\u2019d ever been. \u201cSay yes, Daisy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kissing you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay yes to this.\u201d He dug a box out of his pocket and opened it. Her eyes widened at the pink diamond inside. \u201cPretend to be mine while you really get to know me. Who knows, maybe next time, you\u2019ll be the one to kiss me.\u201d He set the box down on the counter and strolled out of her flat, without waiting for an answer.</p><p>He was barely in his car before Daisy texted him. Well, not him, Jules. He frowned.</p><p>Daisy: I really need someone to talk to. Can I call you?</p><p>It was time to let doubt enter their relationship.</p><p>Jules: Actually, no. I\u2019m rather busy at moment.</p><p>Daisy: Oh. Sorry, I thought you\u2019d be home from work by now.</p><p>Jules: I\u2019m out with some friends. New club in Mayfair.</p><p>Daisy: Oh. Okay. Well, I\u2019ll talk to you later.</p><p>Jules: Probably not tonight. How about I text you when I have a moment?</p><p>Daisy: Sure. Have fun.</p><p>Jules: Thanks. Bye!</p><p>Hating himself, Sebastian threw his phone in the passenger seat beside him, and started up the Mercedes.</p><p>He was taking a big risk by doing this, the biggest he\u2019d ever taken. In the end, he could be without Romanov Industries and Daisy\u2014if he ever manned up and revealed his deception.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>At precisely nine o\u2019clock the next morning, Sebastian parked his Mercedes beside Daisy\u2019s Honda. He got out and walked along the tree-lined path. A few minutes later, he caught sight of her, sitting beside a headstone, flowers in her lap, and her head bent.</p><p>He paused, not wanting to intrude upon her prayers or private thoughts. Perhaps he\u2019d been too hasty in coming. Only he knew that she visited her parents\u2019 graves once a month, on the fifteenth, which was today</p><p>The wind picked up, sending a few petals from the bouquet in his hand floating.</p><p>Daisy lifted her head, her eyes meeting his. An O formed on her mouth, and then a little smile. She waved at him.</p><p>Still feeling like an intruder, he shuffled over and kneeled beside her. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said softly, and then read the inscription on the headstone. Words like Beloved Mother and Beloved Father jumped out at him, as well as the dates. God, her parents had been young and so had she.</p><p>His heart constricted for her.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she said. The wind gently blew, her scent of vanilla and honey reaching him. \u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>Damn it, he was tired of lying, but the end justified the means. She needed him. \u201cZoe informed me that you\u2019d be here this morning instead of your flat right as I was leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her lips trembled.</p><p>He handed her the bouquet. \u201cThese are for your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She took the bouquet and placed it beside hers in the urn situated between the two headstones. Her shoulders shook a little and he reached for her hand, lacing his fingers through hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said again, her voice whisper-thin now. \u201cAfter all these years, I shouldn\u2019t feel like crying. I know my parents are in Heaven, happy and with each other. I know this, but...I\u2019m tired of being alone, Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>As was he. He could be surrounded by business colleagues, friends, or extended family, yet still feel so damn alone that it left an acrid taste in his mouth.</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cI know this might not mean much, but right now, at this moment, you\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m...I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>She turned and gazed up at him, tears threatening to spill over black lashes. Today her sweater was dark blue and she wore even darker jeans, with little black flats on her feet. The chopsticks in her hair were black as well. Such a somber sight she was and that manage to break off a little piece of his heart.</p><p>\u201cEven if I told you that I think this whole fake fianc\u00e9e thing is a bad idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, surprising himself. He\u2019d leave this instant if she wanted.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked, tears now falling down her cheeks.</p><p>Her shoulders shook harder and he pulled her into his arms, stroking her back as she cried without a sound. \u201cTruly,\u201d he whispered in her hair and he meant it.</p><p>Funny how his own father\u2019s death was still fresh in his mind, yet he didn\u2019t feel a tenth of the sorrow she did. Most likely, he never would. As for his mother... She\u2019d made her choice\u2014money over her own sons. Something he hadn\u2019t shared with Daisy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she sniffed, capturing his attention once more. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone that you\u2019re really a sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Lips thinning, he shook his head. He was the exact opposite of a sweetheart. Everything he did was for his own gain, his greater purpose. Except when it came to Daisy. His very awful, drawn-out lie to her didn\u2019t count.</p><p>\u201cNo one would believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d know the truth,\u201d she replied, as if that was all that mattered.</p><p>And in that moment, her knowledge of the truth was all that mattered to him.</p><p>He followed her to town, parking on the street in front of her flat, and met her at the entrance of the building. She smiled at him, and he took it for a positive sign.</p><p>\u201cI really need an answer, Daisy. I don\u2019t have much time, and if you\u2019re not agreeable, then I\u2019ll need to find someone else, which isn\u2019t a problem for me, but you\u2019ll still have the same medical bills looming over you.\u201d He swallowed the boulder in his throat. His threat was empty. There wasn\u2019t a clock running down in the background. The Board didn\u2019t care how quickly he got his life back together. Romanov Industries most likely ran just as well without him, or it had before he\u2019d mucked things up by making a deal with just-this-side-of-legal companies.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, her shoulders slumping.</p><p>\u201cAfter this morning, I would have thought your answer would be yes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her jaw worked. \u201cYou only showed up so I\u2019d agree?\u201d</p><p>Reeling from her accusation, he quickly said, \u201cNo, of course not. I wanted to be there for you.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms. Gone was the woman who\u2019d cried in his arms and told him that she believed the best about him. In her place was a woman who didn\u2019t trust him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause...because\u2014\u201d He ran a hand through his hair, and then pulled at his tie. \u201c\u2014I thought you needed me.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw softened, but only a little. \u201cI did need someone.\u201d</p><p>Jules, he thought savagely. She wanted bloody Jules, and not him, even after the brush off he\u2019d given her. \u201cI\u2019d like to take you out for dinner tonight, around six.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have other plans, with my friend, Isabella.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cInvite Bella along, or does she know about this Jules?\u201d</p><p>Daisy\u2019s eyes narrowed and his heart began to beat faster. He had to stop doing that. \u201cHow did you know she goes by Bella? Never mind, I\u2019m sure Zoe told you. She sure is chatty about me.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea, he thought grimly. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she knows about Jules, but not...everything. Besides, Bella is never going to believe that I\u2019ve fallen for you. We\u2019ve been friends since first grade\u2014nothing gets past her. Nothing.\u201d A small smile curved her sexy lips. \u201cSo you might want to sit this one out.\u201d</p><p>A challenge\u2014he loved this. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal, one that you can\u2019t refuse, and more than likely will end up in your favor. Interested?\u201d He knew she loved a challenge just as much as he did, maybe more.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can convince Bella that I\u2019m madly in love with you, then you agree to pose as my fianc\u00e9e for the next three months. Bills, present and future, all paid off, etcetera, etcetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll pay you the money anyway and look for someone else.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cWhy would you give me the money anyway?\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019d do anything for you, you daft woman. \u201cFor your trouble,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cBut there is one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cGo on then. Give me your condition.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, slowly. \u201cYou have to play along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said with a toss of her head. \u201cBut you can meet us at Jack\u2019s Fine Italian Dining. No need to drive together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we kiss on it?\u201d he asked, leaning closer. \u201cYou know, to make it official.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes fluttered and she licked her bottom lip. She took a step closer to him, her eyes trained on his mouth. Oh yeah, she was thinking about their last kiss, and she was thinking of kissing him now, too.</p><p>Suddenly, she stuck out her hand and he took it, rubbing his thumb over her skin. He let it slide down to her wrist, where her pulse was beating wildly. Slowly, giving her time to deny him, he raised her hand to his lips and kissed it, dragging his mouth over her skin and savoring the taste and feel.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you could kiss me,\u201d she gasped, yanking her hand out of his grasp.</p><p>He glanced down at her and smirked. Daisy\u2019s nipples were hard against her sweater, and it wasn\u2019t from the cold. The day was temperate. Perfect, really, even if it had started off with a rather solemn visit.</p><p>\u201cAh, but you didn\u2019t stop me either.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened and closed a couple of times, before she glared at him.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is say the word, and I won\u2019t do it again, except for tonight. See you this evening.\u201d Without waiting for her answer, he turned, got into his car, and drove away. A quick glance into his rearview mirror let him know that she still stood there, staring after him.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cExplain to me again how you\u2019re suddenly dating Sebastian Romanov,\u201d Isabella said, tawny eyes narrowed. Oh yeah, her best friend\u2019s you\u2019re-so-full-of-it detector was on high alert.</p><p>No telling what Haven would have said\u2014if she\u2019d been able to join them.</p><p>Bella tapped the table. \u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start at the beginning\u2014when a guy likes a girl, he generally asks her out to get to know her better. Those events are called dates. And sometimes, when two people fall in love after all those dates, they lead to other things like...\u201d Daisy paused, unable to get out the word engagement.</p><p>Her phone vibrated and she grabbed it, thankful for the interruption.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cText from the earl,\u201d Daisy said.</p><p>Sorry, I\u2019m running late \u2013S</p><p>Oh, I hadn\u2019t noticed. ~D</p><p>&gt;:-S</p><p>Good. He didn\u2019t need to know that she\u2019d checked the entrance to the restaurant at least a thousand times since she\u2019d arrived, or that her heart had sped up each time she thought he was the one opening the door.</p><p>Isabella tilted her head, her nose scrunching up on one side. \u201cI go out of town for two days and suddenly you\u2019re in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d The blush that heated her cheeks most likely gave credence to her words. Daisy grabbed the nearest roll from the breadbasket, turning in over and over in her hands. \u201cI, we...he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best news ever,\u201d Isabella squealed, making Daisy drop the poor roll she\u2019d been tearing apart.</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Daisy asked, nonplussed by her friend\u2019s reaction. She\u2019d thought Isabella would call her out on it.</p><p>\u201cGosh, yes.\u201d Her best friend took a quick sip of water. \u201cThe only man you talk to is virtual, and who knows if he\u2019s anything like you say he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Jules since yesterday. He\u2019s acting a little strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, who cares? You have a real live man that wants to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I care, for one. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Isabella waved a hand in the air, effectively cutting Daisy off. \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you, okay? The whole Jules thing is a little sketchy. I mean, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a really nice person and all, but you\u2019ve never seen him, never talked to him in person... What if he\u2019s really some teenager or a fifty-year-old perv who got a hold of a woman while she was vulnerable?\u201d</p><p>All of that and more had occurred to Daisy, but Jules was Jules. He didn\u2019t talk like a teenager and she hoped like hell he wasn\u2019t a fifty-year-old perv. But wouldn\u2019t a perv ask her about what she was wearing? He never did that. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Bella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019re like me, inclined to believe the good about people. Then when Glen broke up with you, you were vulnerable. Who says he didn\u2019t take advantage of that?\u201d</p><p>Daisy shook her head. \u201cYou know, it would have been really nice for you to have told me all of that nine months ago.\u201d</p><p>Isabella grabbed her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey, and you\u2019re probably right, but I thought Jules was what you needed at the time. And now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I don\u2019t need him because there\u2019s a real live man who\u2019s interested in me,\u201d Daisy mumbled.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Isabelle beamed, giving Daisy\u2019s hand a little squeeze before she let go. \u201cI\u2019m freaking thrilled for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I,\u201d Sebastian said as he slipped in the booth to sit beside Daisy. He caught her hand and turned it to kiss her palm. \u201cMissed you, darling.\u201d</p><p>Of course he took the opportunity to kiss her. She hadn\u2019t told him no and, per their deal, she wasn\u2019t supposed to tell him no, because they had to look like a couple in love. Gah! But he hadn\u2019t said that she could do her darndest to trip him up.</p><p>Too bad Haven was out of town this week, having gone to a wedding in Alaska, of all places. The town she would be staying in still had dial-up internet and no cell phone towers, only satellite connection or something like that</p><p>\u201cWhat did you miss about me the most, sweetheart?\u201d She batted her lashes at him and raised her wine glass to her lips, taking a sip.</p><p>\u201cListening to you hum whilst you bake.\u201d</p><p>Daisy almost spit the wine all over his fancy suit. Instead, she forced the liquid down and smiled. How in the heck did he know that about her?</p><p>Isabella\u2019s eyes widened and she smacked the table. \u201cIsn\u2019t it crazy how she always does that? And if it\u2019s something she really likes she breaks into\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSong,\u201d he finished.</p><p>God, she was really going to have a talk with her cousin.</p><p>Shaking her head, Isabella laughed. \u201cBut the words are so, so wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least she\u2019s in tune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you,\u201d Isabella said with a wry smile, and then she turned to Daisy. \u201cHave you shown him your Harry Potter collection?\u201d</p><p>Daisy shot Isabella a look. Was nothing sacred? \u201cNot yet.\u201d Slicing Sebastian a glance, she tipped up her chin, daring him to make fun of her.</p><p>He rubbed his chin. \u201cSo that was Hedwig on your desk.\u201d</p><p>Daisy blinked. He knew who Hedwig was? \u201cUm, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re totally outed, sweetie.\u201d Isabella laughed. \u201cOne time she made me drive two hours just to get a limited edition\u2014who was it again\u2014Hagar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHagrid.\u201d Not that her best friend actually listened. Oh no.</p><p>\u201cAssertive and persuasive, eh?\u201d Sebastian chuckled. \u201cTell me more about this trip.\u201d</p><p>Frowning at the two of them as they shared stories about her, Daisy pulled her hand from his grasp. Great.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s smile turned from nice to positively sinful. Of course, Isabella noticed. Her cheeks got all red and she did that little hair flippy thing that men liked.</p><p>Jealousy, that evil bitch, tried to nudge Daisy into throwing the bread basket at her best friend. Wait, she didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s tail about Sebastian\u2019s flirting. He could flirt with everyone that caught his eyes and it didn\u2019t matter to her. What mattered was finding out why Jules had blown her off.</p><p>Giving herself a mental shake, she took several breaths, and then dug into her pasta. Let Sebastian convince Isabella he was in love, without her help, because it didn\u2019t seem like he needed it. She\u2019d just sit here and watch the\u2014</p><p>Sebastian turned to her, his eyes blue as the summer sky instead of their usual frosty lake. So blue, they were, and growing darker by the second. His gaze dipped lower, to her breasts. Her nipples responded, tightening to hard points.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, love?\u201d</p><p>At that moment, she\u2019d agree to anything he said. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He turned away, breaking the spell she\u2019d been under. Oh God, she\u2019d just said he was right. She was so going to have a talk with her libido.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I have an important call to make.\u201d He kissed her cheek and, despite everything, her body got all happy and tingly from it. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll survive without you near me.\u201d Sliding his gaze to Isabella, he grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve become quite used to having her at my side.\u201d</p><p>Isabella sighed dreamily while Daisy forced herself not to puke up what she had eaten. He made her sound like his favorite pet.</p><p>As soon as Sebastian was out of earshot, her best friend grabbed her hand. \u201cI totally approve of this relationship.\u201d</p><p>Of course she did. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m being too impulsive?\u201d</p><p>Isabella snorted. \u201cIn less than twenty-four hours, I\u2019m heading to the Bahamas to elope, without having told anyone but you and Haven. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>A little feeling of disloyalty snaked through Daisy. \u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows\u2014maybe I\u2019ll come back from my honeymoon and you\u2019ll be engaged. Then we get to plan your wedding of the century.\u201d Isabella lifted her glass in the air. \u201cHere\u2019s to true love.\u201d</p><p>Here\u2019s to true lies, Daisy thought glumly. The only thing Sebastian loved was Romanov Industries, not that that mattered to her. Nothing he did mattered to her.</p><p>Except, he\u2019d saved her from embarrassment with Glen. He\u2019d sat with her by her parents\u2019 grave and held her. No one had been around to witness that. The street had been virtually deserted when Glen and Nina had shown up, and the cemetery wasn\u2019t exactly a town hotspot.</p><p>And Sebastian had sounded completely sincere when she\u2019d asked him about why he\u2019d done it.</p><p>They clinked their glasses together and Daisy fought the urge to spill her guts.</p><p>Her phone vibrated. She fully expected another text from Sebastian, but it was a reminder to get her tail down to the library. \u201cCheese and crackers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hors d\u2019oeuvres are already there and ready to go. The library wanted something simple since only twenty-five guests RSVP\u2019d.\u201d Grabbing her purse and slipping on her jacket, she slid out of the booth. She reached into her wallet and pulled out enough money to cover her tab, placing it on the table. \u201cBut I promised to help hand out the listing of items as people arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in charge of the money.\u201d Isabella followed her to the door. \u201cOne of the volunteers had to cancel, so I\u2019ll get to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Flashing a genuine smile, Daisy texted Sebastian as she waited for Isabella to put on a coat.</p><p>Headed to library ~D</p><p>Which one? \u2013S</p><p>Only one ~D</p><p>Figures -S</p><p>The cold March afternoon air went straight thru the gap in Daisy\u2019s coat. She quickly buttoned it, and then turned to her best friend. \u201cWanna walk with me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot in these shoes,\u201d Isabella said, sticking out her leg. She wore leather booties with heels at least three inches tall. \u201cIt\u2019s a ten minute walk to the library and that\u2019s nine too many. Besides, I have to run over to my parents\u2019 house to get my cell phone. I can drop you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s in the opposite direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in a bit,\u201d Isabella called out, before sliding in her car.</p> <p>After waving good-bye, Daisy set off in the direction of the library. Streetlights flickered on and the wind blew. Wishing she\u2019d driven her Honda, she shoved her hands in her pockets and quickened her pace.</p><p>Her phone vibrated just as she entered the library. She checked the screen as she hung up her coat.</p><p>Safe?\u2013S</p><p>A strange feeling passed over her. Why did he care if she were safe? She hadn\u2019t had anyone worry about her safety or lack thereof for over a year, besides Jules. Glen had always assumed she\u2019d get where she was going to in one piece.</p><p>The only other person who\u2019d ever worried about her was her momma. Which was why she was here tonight to help raise money for the library to buy more bookmobiles to service the rural parts of the county.</p> <p>Those bookmobiles had been her mom\u2019s only way to escape from the pain while she convalesced at home. Every Wednesday, just like clockwork, the bookmobile would show up at their house.</p><p>She glanced at her phone again.</p><p>Yes ~D</p><p>See you soon \u2013S</p><p>The new head librarian rushed to her, and Daisy smiled. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Daisy Barnes. Sorry, I haven\u2019t had a chance to introduce myse\u2014\u201d</p><p>The woman shoved a stack of pamphlets into Daisy\u2019s hands and dragged her by the arm to the entrance. \u201cWe can do introductions later. Right now, I need for you to stand here, look pretty, and...well, if you don\u2019t mind, get that earl of yours to bid on something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>The woman gave her a look. \u201cPlease, everyone is talking about y\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d Daisy repeated, her voice weak. Apparently, the new librarian wasn\u2019t that new. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t get me started about him leaving your place the other day, after an extended period of time. Or the bouquet of flowers he had delivered. Looks like romance runs in the family with those Romanov boys.\u201d</p><p>Daisy blinked. \u201cAh, well, menus and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowtime.\u201d The woman smiled, talking through her teeth as the group of patrons walked inside. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to ask him to bid.\u201d</p><p>Well, wasn\u2019t that special. Everyone already thought they were a couple. It was too perfect. It was too much of a lie. Closing her eyes, she let her head fall back against the glass wall behind her.</p><p>\u201cDaisy,\u201d the librarian hissed.</p> <p>Her eyes snapped open and she took a deep breath. Time to focus on something that she could make a positive impact on.</p><p>Her earl showed up right before the presentation started.</p><p>Automatically smiling, she handed him the last pamphlet just as he leaned in to kiss her. She turned her head so it would land on her cheek, but somehow he ended up brushing his lips over hers. Her knees went as wobbly as a Jell-O mold.</p><p>Dang it.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling quite well?\u201d he asked, brushing back a stray piece of hair. \u201cYou look a bit flushed, love.\u201d</p><p>It seemed as though every person in the building stared at the two of them. This might actually work in her favor. There was no way he\u2019d ever cause a scene in front of anyone, especially since the town\u2019s only newspaper reporter was here with his camera.</p><p>Swallowing, she looked into his eyes. \u201cYou won the bet,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I can\u2019t go through with it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed, hot and bright like a flame. His fingers tightened, then loosened but didn\u2019t let go. \u201cWe had an agreement.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze, staring at her flats and wishing she were anywhere but here. \u201cI know, but I can\u2019t... I can\u2019t lie to the people I love.\u201d Like Jules. She was betraying Jules with her lusty thoughts for a man she hardly knew. A man she had to pretend to like and love. A man she really wanted to hold and kiss her. Kiss her hand, her lips...every part of her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to your place and talk,\u201d Sebastian said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a shake of her head. \u201cI promised I\u2019d be here to help raise money for the bookmobiles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfterwards then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me before everyone gets the wrong impression.\u201d Slowly, she met his furious gaze and swallowed. He smiled, a baring of teeth that made her stomach drop. She\u2019d really made him mad, and it was all her fault. \u201cAre you allowed to sit?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He walked away, tugging her along. She almost ran to keep up with his long strides, sitting beside him in the second row. He let go of her fingers, only to place a possessive hand on her thigh.</p><p>Sebastian kept a neutral, if not bored, expression on his face, but inside he seethed. Promises. She had a bloody promise to keep to the damn library? What about to him? He\u2019d taken up her challenge and convinced her best friend that he was a man in love, that he thought her to be adorable and fun to be around.</p><p>Things he thought constantly about her. Until now.</p><p>\u201cSebastian, let go of my leg,\u201d Daisy said in his ear, lips brushing against the lobe and sending waves of torturous pleasure down his neck. \u201cI need to give a speech.\u201d</p><p>He allowed his hand to fall away, but he could still feel the firm shape of her thigh under his palm. Daisy scooted by, the scent of honey and vanilla hitting him.</p><p>How pretty she looked, all soft and feminine, in her usual cardigan and swingy skirt. She wore her long hair in a loose bun, but the chopsticks holding it in place were a vibrant blue instead of this morning\u2019s black.</p><p>She walked to the front of the room and began to speak, telling the audience why she valued the bookmobiles\u2019 services so much. She spoke of her mother\u2019s battle with cancer and how books had helped them both get through the not-so-good days. There wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the room (except for his) by the time she finished.</p><p>His anger flowed out of him, like a ship sailing on the tide. Of course, this actually meant something to her. It served a greater purpose than his position on the board or even her insurance bills. She was truly one of those people that cared about others and tried to make the smallest of differences.</p><p>With a smile, she gestured to her table. \u201cSo tonight, I hope you\u2019ll be generous when you bid on a year\u2019s supply of cupcakes, personally baked and delivered by me once a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo million,\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you got three million dollars sitting in the bank, Noah,\u201d someone called out and the crowd laughed.</p><p>Craning his neck, Sebastian found the arse who dared to bid against him. Some dark-haired bloke wearing a navy shirt who\u2019d crossed his arms over his chest and smirked.</p><p>In that moment, Sebastian didn\u2019t care if the man had any money or not. \u201cFour,\u201d he said as faced the front once more. He wasn\u2019t about to let some other man eat her cupcakes.</p><p>\u201cAll yours, Romanov,\u201d the man said with a low laugh. \u201cMust be some damn good cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>A murmur rippled through the crowd.</p><p>Daisy\u2019s hazel eyes narrowed, her hands fisting on her hips. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be silent, you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite so, darling.\u201d Pulling out his phone, Sebastian texted Daisy his offer and winked when he was done.</p><p>She glanced down, and then held her phone out for the other woman to read. The tall redhead didn\u2019t waste any time as she yelled, \u201cSold.\u201d</p><p>The town\u2019s online reporter took Sebastian\u2019s picture, and then gave him a thumbs-up. Brilliant. The Board would be pleased once they got wind of it, and he knew without a doubt they were keeping tabs on him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a round of applause for the Earl of Spenserfield\u2019s generous donation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, except, I adore her cupcakes.\u201d Rising to his feet, he collected a stunned Daisy and headed out the door. \u201cDarling, a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave. I have things to do. Hors d'oeuvres to replenish.\u201d Once outside and away from nosy stares, she tried to pull out of his embrace, but he wouldn\u2019t let her. \u201cMy purse and coat\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her protesting mouth, his hands cupping her shoulders.</p><p>She melted against him, her arms winding around his neck as she pressed closer. The feel of her curvaceous body against his threatened to break through his armor of self-control. Every intention of not initiating their next kiss completely flew out the window. Hell, those intentions flew so hard and swift that they shattered the glass.</p><p>\u201cSay no. Tell me to stop, and I will.\u201d He dug his fingers into her skin and she whimpered, then slipped her tongue inside of his mouth. Their tongue slid against each other, hot and wet.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say no,\u201d she whispered against his lips. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you to stop.\u201d</p><p>Some cruel part of him had to ask, \u201cWhat about Jules?\u201d</p><p>Leaning back in his arms, she shivered, hazel eyes glazed with passion. For him. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules, the man you sworn to be saving your kisses for,\u201d he said, cursing himself for even bringing Jules up. But here he was again\u2014jealous.</p><p>\u201cScrew you, Sebastian Romanov,\u201d she spat, her eyes blazing as she shoved him away from her.</p><p>The cold March wind brushed the exposed skin of his neck, but he was too damn heated from their kiss. She shivered again, and he felt like an ass for not doing something about it the first time. Hell, he was an ass for everything he\u2019d just said to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Taking off his coat, he draped it around her. \u201cIf you will excuse me, I\u2019ll be on my way back to England.\u201d He turned to walk away.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she cried out and he stopped. \u201cWhy did you pay so much for my cupcakes?\u201d</p><p>Examining his motives or even explaining them to anyone was unthinkable, but this was Daisy. She deserved the truth, or at least as much as he could give her, and now that he\u2019d messed everything up, he\u2019d go back to being Jules Westmoreland, apologize for being an ass, and love her from afar while making excuse after excuse about why he couldn\u2019t ever meet her in person.</p><p>\u201cI bid on the blasted cupcakes, because this event was important to you.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cBecause you were crying and talking about your mum.\u201d</p><p>Her pretty eyes searched his face. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d he asked, hoping against hope she really did mean what she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be your fianc\u00e9e,\u201d she said.</p><p>Screw Jules Westmoreland. \u201cWould you take the chance on getting to know me?\u201d He was taking a big risk by saying this, by purposefully not answering her texts for the past day and a half. He\u2019d been in agony over it, but he was, at heart, a risk-taker. She blinked up at him, and he could practically see her mind working. She was weighing and assessing him. Weighing and assessing what Isabella had said tonight about Jules not being who he said he was, while he, Sebastian, was in the flesh.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d eavesdropped and he\u2019d do it again if he thought it would help him.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d like that,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>Victory was his. \u201cHave a good night, Daisy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your coat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pop down to your flat tomorrow to retrieve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Sebastian,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI prefer Bastian, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled, and his heart turned over in his chest. \u201cNight, Bastian.\u201d</p><p>The urge to kiss her again came upon him so quickly that he took a step towards her. A deep breath sustained his self-control. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Pivoting, he nearly sprinted to his car and got in, driving away, but he couldn\u2019t help but glance up at his rearview mirror.</p><p>Daisy still stood where he\u2019d left, beneath a halo of light, his coat wrapped around her.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Lifting the collar of his coat, Daisy buried her nose in the fabric. It smelled so good. So him.</p><p>She was so in trouble.</p><p>Sighing, she turned to head back inside the library. Just as she pushed open the first set of door, Isabella barreled into her. Daisy grabbed her, Sebastian\u2019s coat sliding to the floor. They knelt at the same time, her best friend handing her the coat.</p><p>\u201cLate for your flight?\u201d Daisy asked with a smile. Then she got a good look at Isabella and gasped. Her tawny eyes were rimmed in red and her face was all splotchy. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Fat tears rolled down Isabella\u2019s cheeks. \u201cHe l-left me for that woman. I got a text message with their Vegas Wedding picture. The coward.\u201d She sniffed and looked up at the ceiling, then back at Daisy. \u201cYou and Haven were so right about him. I\u2019m so stupid.\u201d</p><p>Heart breaking for her best friend, Daisy helped Isabella to her feet and wrapped her arms around her. She stroked her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid and it\u2019s not your fault the rat bastard left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all rat bastards. Every last one of them,\u201d Isabella said, her voice shaky. \u201cNot Sebastian, of course. I\u2019m sure you two are perfect for each other.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Daisy turned her head. Isabella\u2019s older brother walked in. All tall, dark-haired and devastatingly handsome, but without the swagger of someone who needed the world to acknowledge it. Growing up, Daisy had a huge crush on him, but he\u2019d only had eyes for Summer Holland. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daisy had a sneaking suspicion he still only had eyes for Summer.</p><p>Her best friend began to sob as her brother caught her up in a hug. \u201cD-don\u2019t l-lecture m-me, Gab-briel,\u201d Isabella managed to say.</p><p>\u201cThought you might need a ride home when this was over,\u201d Gabriel said, his voice low and soothing. \u201cBut there\u2019s something you should know.\u201d</p> <p>If that womanzing asshat had gotten that woman he\u2019d run off with pregnant, Daisy would hunt him down herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to say it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her best friend gripped his coat. \u201cSpit it out, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all over the news. Everyone knows.\u201d He hugged Isabella tighter. \u201cSorry, honey.\u201d</p><p>Daisy caught Gabriel\u2019s eye. \u201cTake Bella home. I\u2019ll cover for her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Isabella sniffed, stepping out of her brother\u2019s embrace.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go on a vacation, Bella. Maybe to the Bahamas or someplace where people won\u2019t bother you.\u201d Daisy raised her brows, trying to convey her thoughts while keeping her own tears at bay. \u201cI\u2019ll hold down the fort while you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d Isabella dashed a hand over her eyes, glancing up at her brother and then at Daisy. \u201cAnd you know what else?\u201d</p><p>Daisy gave her a watery smile. She hated to see anyone cry alone, especially her best friend. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Isabella grabbed her hand, squeezing it so hard that Daisy almost gasped in pain. \u201cI love you, Daisy Starr Barnes.</p><p>Daisy watched her friend leave, waving as Gabriel\u2019s truck pulled out of the parking lot. By the time she returned to the fundraiser, people had already eaten, bid on the items they had wanted, and were putting on their coats.</p> <p>Smiles and laughter were a good indicator tonight had gone well. Heading to the long table of now empty food platters, she cleaned and packed up her supplies.</p><p>\u201cThanks for all of your help, Daisy,\u201d the new librarian called out as she hefted the first bag. \u201cBe sure to tell Isabella not to worry either. Poor girl, migraine hitting her at the worst possible time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, and I will.\u201d Daisy wanted to smack herself as the woman ducked into an office. She still hadn\u2019t gotten her name.</p><p>Daisy nodded, and then made two trips to her car before wishing everyone who was left a good night. Twenty minutes later, she was in her favorite pjs and relaxing in bed while checking her email.</p><p>One in particular caught her attention\u2014mostly because it sounded like one of those foreign you\u2019ve-won-the-lottery emails.</p><p>My dearest Daisy,</p><p>It has come to my attention that you have become acquainted with my beloved son. I do hope that you treat him well.</p><p>If you find it in your heart, and have the time\u2014</p> <p>\u201cGive me a break,\u201d she muttered at the screen.</p><p>Fuming, she drilled her fingers on the laptop and wondered if she should bother to tell Sebastian. The woman wanted information, that Daisy knew for sure. However, the part about her beloved son...Yeah, a little over the top, and Daisy wasn\u2019t responding to some poser looking for dirt, not that she had any. But there was the urge to email this Francesca, Countess of Spenserfield and tell her off for pretending to be somebody\u2019s momma.</p><p>Daisy turned and stared at the wall, taking in all the pictures she had of her family. Tons were of her and her mom, at all stages of life and cancer. There weren\u2019t that many of her dad, who had been killed in Iraq during the first Gulf War, when she\u2019d been a toddler. Some were of her extended family in Holland Springs and down in Georgia. At any given time, she had more relatives in federal prison than out.</p><p>What would they think of her agreement? She snorted softly. They\u2019d be all for it.</p><p>Her email notification dinged again. This time it was from Jules. Her heart began to beat like crazy in her chest and her palms grew damp. She licked her dry lips and then clicked on the email.</p><p>Daisy,</p><p>I happened to see some pictures of you and Sebastian Romanov at dinner. The two of you look great together. Happy, even.</p><p>It\u2019s led me to believe that what you and I need is a real relationship, with real people. As much as I enjoy talking to you, darling, this isn\u2019t ever going to work. My schedule, etc. makes it impossible for me to come to the States, and let\u2019s face it, you don\u2019t have the finances to come here for an extended amount of time.</p><p>\u201cWho are you and what have you done to my Jules?\u201d she whispered brokenly.</p><p>So let\u2019s not gently tug at the Band-Aid. Let\u2019s just rip it off, and each go our own way. It\u2019s for the best.</p><p>I love you too much for you not to live in the real world.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Jules</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried at the screen and reached for her phone. She texted Jules. She called Jules. She left message after message, begging and pleading with him to call her back.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jules,\u201d she sobbed, as her heart broke into a million pieces. This was worse than her breakup with Glen. This was worse than anything she\u2019d ever felt except for her mother\u2019s death. Or maybe it was worse, because Jules was out there living his life, while she had to stay here. Alone.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, please. I need you. Don\u2019t leave me like this. Who else can I talk to? Who else will listen to me? It\u2019s not fair you made this decision without me. DAMMIT JULES, call me back.\u201d</p><p>There was only one person who was responsible for this entire mess, and only one person that could fix it\u2014Sebastian Romanov.</p><p>Come tomorrow, he\u2019d explain everything to Jules.</p><p>Or else.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, Sebastian, if you pull out a handkerchief to wipe off anything, I\u2019ll beat your arse,\u201d Christian threatened as they walked inside the local pub.</p><p>Dropping the silk material while easing his hand out of his pocket, Sebastian smirked. \u201cI was merely ascertaining where to best keep my wallet so it doesn\u2019t get nicked.\u201d</p><p>Christian rolled his eyes. \u201cCould you stop with the Masterpiece Theater talk? You\u2019re twenty-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does my age have to do with the perpetual lowering of the standards of elocution?\u201d There was nothing in the world he liked doing more than goad his twin, especially when he was in a foul mood. Breaking up with Daisy had put him in said foul mood.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Sebastian put his hands behind his back and tried to look as though he was having fun. But he wasn\u2019t and they\u2019d just arrived. He was miserable as hell over the email he\u2019d sent, and the first of her texts and voice mails had only begun to show up.</p><p>\u201cOh my giddy aunt,\u201d Christian groaned. \u201cStay here and I\u2019ll get us a couple of pints.\u201d He headed to the bar.</p><p>Sebastian shifted to his right, stepping in something sticky and most likely vile. He grimaced and took in the place. Country music blared on an old jukebox. A band set up their instruments on the stage. Bras and jock straps hung from the ceiling.</p><p>His foot tapped to the beat of the music. The band was quite good and the pub was crowded. It seemed as though the entire population of Holland Spring\u2019s over-eighteen crowd was in attendance. Except her. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Daisy.</p><p>\u201cHere, and remember what I said about the hanky.\u201d Christian thrust a bottle at him, the cap off.</p><p>\u201cThis where you get up to regularly?\u201d Sebastian surreptitiously wiped the top off on his coat and followed his brother to an empty table. No one seemed to care that a world-famous actor was among them. Perhaps that\u2019s why Christian loved living in Holland Springs so much, aside from his wife.</p><p>Setting his beer down, Christian studied him. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t have something sarcastic to say along the lines of Zoe allowing me out of the house.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian gave his brother a look. \u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomanov men aren\u2019t allowed to do anything. We just do,\u201d Sebastian said in all seriousness. And the thing he would do tomorrow\u2014make Daisy his fianc\u00e9e so that they could get to know one another in the real world by putting that damned ring on her finger.</p><p>\u201cJust when I thought there was hope.\u201d Christian grabbed his beer and raised it. \u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian copied him, and then asked, \u201cIs this the only pub around?\u201d</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Christian set the bottle down and nodded at someone behind Sebastian. \u201cYes, and I\u2019m sorry it doesn\u2019t meet your high standards.\u201d</p><p>His brother knew nothing of his standards. Sure, this place wouldn\u2019t be his first choice, but Sebastian\u2019s favorite pub wasn\u2019t exactly a five-star dining establishment.</p><p>For the next ten minutes, neither did anything other than drink and look around the bar.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t awkward at all, Sebastian thought grimly. He held up his bottle of beer. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It was surprisingly good. Actually, it was better than good. He\u2019d like to take home a keg of it.</p><p>\u201cHomebrew. Company\u2019s called Two Bugs Brewing.\u201d His brother grinned. \u201cThe blokes that make it want to start up a micro-brewery, and I\u2019m thinking of investing. They\u2019ve already a massive following.\u201d</p><p>Finally, a topic that interested him and one he could contribute to, even help out his brother. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a copy of their profit margin, marketing campaign, distribution\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian took another drink and set the bottle down. Undeterred by his brother\u2019s thank you, he started again, \u201cA background check is needed as well as a look into their finances. One can\u2019t be too careful these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there ever a time you can talk about anything other than business?\u201d His brother shook his head. \u201cYour conversations with Daisy must be scintillating, poor girl. \u2018What\u2019s the profit margin of your catering business? Have you considered this brand of flour instead of brand x? There\u2019s a two percent savings with that one.\u2019\u201d</p><p>No, his conversations with Daisy were anything but business. \u201cWhy did you bring me here, Christian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo help you out with your little problem, of course.\u201d His brother\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cShould there be another reason?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo. However, I appreciate you sacrifice. You wife\u2019s company is surely preferred to mine.\u201d His eyes kept straying to the door. Maybe if he willed Daisy to walk through she would. Maybe if he texted her. He slipped his hand into his pocket, palming his phone. Maybe he should leave her the hell alone tonight. Jules had broken her heart after all.</p><p>\u201cDamnable pride,\u201d Christian said, capturing Sebastian\u2019s attention. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian let go of his cell and frowned. \u201cFor once you were thinking instead of doing, that\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich gets us nowhere.\u201d Christian slapped some money on the table. \u201cI\u2019d hoped\u2014ah, bugger it. Ready to go?\u201d</p><p>Before Sebastian could answer, his brother had already turned and walked away. He hated this, this wall between them that couldn\u2019t be scaled with conversations about anything. He didn\u2019t know what to do or what to say to make things better.</p><p>And why should he?</p><p>Christian didn\u2019t need him. His brother had a wife and a family that cared for him. There was no way Sebastian could compete with that, not with their history, and as his brother constantly reminded him\u2014Vladimir Romanov\u2019s legacy lived on in Sebastian.</p><p>Jaw and fists clenching, he followed his brother out of the pub. Then he got in his car, and made himself listen to every last one of Daisy\u2019s voicemails to Jules.</p><p>Repeatedly.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>As soon as Sebastian woke up the next day, he went straight to Daisy\u2019s. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what he\u2019d say or do to make her feel better, but he had to do something.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t expecting him exactly, but he had said he\u2019d be back to get his coat and there was still the business of securing his position with Romanov Industries.</p><p>Unfortunately, the more time he spent here, the less inclined he was to worry about it, and that worried him. Never before had he purposefully put business at the bottom of his everyday to-do list. Normally, it ranked up there, at the very top. Or it had, until he\u2019d met Daisy.</p><p>She resided at the top, everything else second and third, and in some cases falling off his list completely.</p><p>Today was no different. Today he had to fix things for her.</p><p>Just as he raised a hand to knock, the door was jerked open and there stood Daisy, eyes puffy and mouth thin.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she growled. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come inside so we can have a little talk?\u201d</p><p>She knew. Oh bloody hell, she knew. \u201cOkay.\u201d With a tight smile, she moved out of his way and he stepped inside. The door slammed shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d she cried, marching up to him and shoving a finger in his chest. \u201cI hadn\u2019t agreed to anything yet.\u201d</p><p>Wait, she didn\u2019t know. He blinked, encircling her wrist with his hand and keeping it against him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are pictures of us, everywhere. I looked on the Internet. Jules saw, and he-he\u2014\u201d She bit her bottom lip and looked away. Tears fell from the corner of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd he what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe broke up with me,\u201d she said, her voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and he was. He hated hurting her.</p><p>Her fingers tightened in his shirt, pulling on it. \u201cHe was nice about it, and said I needed to have a relationship in real life. Is there something wrong with me, Sebastian? Am I so horrible that I can\u2019t even keep a virtual boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>With his free hand, he smoothed her hair as best he could. It was pulled on top of her head, in a rubber band instead of her usual chopsticks. \u201cNo. He\u2019s the asshole. Not you. You were honest with him, and he took the easy way out. Maybe it\u2019s for the best.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Guilt scraped over his body, leaving him raw.</p><p>You did this, a voice in his mind whispered. You made her cry.</p><p>And I can make her feel better, he swore. I\u2019ll make her forget all about Jules, if it\u2019s the last damn thing I do.</p> <p>\u201cBella would agree with you,\u201d she sniffed.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come have dinner with me, at Christian\u2019s house? The entire family will be there and we can announce the engagement.\u201d Forward. Always moving towards his goal.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess that would get my mind off of Jules.\u201d</p><p>At least she hadn\u2019t said no. Still...He let go of her wrist and stroked her cheek. \u201cWould you wear my ring?\u201d She didn\u2019t flinch. She didn\u2019t lean in. In fact, she did nothing at all. Her hazel eyes were dull.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling lower than anything that had every stuck to the bottom of a rubbish pile, he murmured, \u201cI\u2019ll wait outside by the car while you change.\u201d</p><p>Daisy watched as Sebastian strode around his car, his body tall and lean. His strides were purposeful and sexy. He was powerful and compelling.</p><p>While she was helpless and weepy, eyes all puffy and rimmed in red. Makeup had helped a little. The shiny ring on her hand had helped her a little, too. She wouldn\u2019t apologize about that either; it was pretty and sparkly. Two things that always made her feel better. He opened her door and smiled, \u201cShall we, darling?\u201d</p><p>Darling. Jules called her darling all of the time. \u201cDon\u2019t call me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, force of habit,\u201d Sebastian said with a smile and gently pushed the hair out of her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s better. I can see your pretty face now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a look, but she didn\u2019t care. She needed compliments from a man. She needed to be assured that she was pretty, smart, and fun to be around. That she didn\u2019t drive men away, especially the ones she loved.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious what I think about you?\u201d he answered as they walked up the steps of the front porch.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she answered.</p><p>He stopped at the door and looked at her. The lights by the door highlighted his handsome face. \u201cAsk me.\u201d</p><p>She let out a shaky breath. \u201cWhat do you think about me?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian cupped her face, tipping it up. \u201cI think you\u2019re sexy, beautiful, kind, and smart. Any man, including Jules Westmoreland, who\u2019s not willing to do anything short of murder to be with you, doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That hadn\u2019t been the compliment she\u2019d craved. Oh no. It was much, much better and really, really unexpected. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p> <p>Rising on her toes, she licked her lips and waited for him to kiss her. She wanted him to kiss her. He was close enough for her to kiss. All she had to do was lean forward and\u2014</p><p>The door opened right as his hands fell away.</p><p>Zoe stood there, her gaze going from Daisy to Sebastian and then back to Daisy. \u201cHope you like pasta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love pasta,\u201d Daisy said, as she stepped inside, keeping her strides all casual. Dear God, she hoped her cousin hadn\u2019t seen anything. Or worse, Aunt Leah was here and thought she saw something.</p><p>Sebastian followed, not saying a word.</p><p>Her cousin stopped in the dining room. The table was set for four, and Daisy breathed out a silent sigh of relief. All she really could handle tonight was Zoe and Christian, not the entire Ambrose clan.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all got here at just the right time,\u201d Zoe said as Christian brought in glasses and a bottle of wine.</p><p>\u201cThis ought to be great fun,\u201d he said with a wink at her and his wife.</p><p>She felt nothing, absolutely nothing, while looking at him. Sneaking a glance over her shoulder, she smiled up at Sebastian. He didn\u2019t smile back, but her heart rate went into overdrive.</p><p>\u201cShall I pour?\u201d Sebastian held out his hand to take the bottle of wine from his brother.</p><p>Christian offered the bottle, only to take it back at the last minute. \u201cBefore I do, I want to know what we\u2019re celebrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure the two of you will understand, more than anyone,\u201d Daisy began.</p><p>Zoe shook her head, giving Daisy a sympathetic smile. \u201cWe already know. Everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Daisy waved a hand in the air, making sure her ring caught the light. Zoe\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cYay for fake engagements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice ring,\u201d Christian said with a glance at his wife. Zoe gave him a secret smile that made Daisy jealous. Why couldn\u2019t she have that? Oh wait, she had had that, and the guy broke up with her. Over the Internet.</p><p>Christian cleared his throat when no one said anything else. \u201cShall we sit?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian pulled out her chair and she sat down. He sat beside her and, after blessing the food, he began to eat. His table manners were beautiful, like him. Everything he did was gorgeous, from the way he ate to the way he drank from his wineglass.</p><p>Only he was so silent, so serious.</p><p>She wanted to muss his hair and make him laugh. Make him unserious. And oh dear God, was she turning into one of those women? Broody equals sexy challenge?</p><p>Sebastian glanced her way, sexy blue eyes slowly raking over her. No, he wasn\u2019t a challenge. She knew he was attracted to her. Hadn\u2019t he kissed her often enough in the past few days to prove it?</p><p>\u201cDid you know I brought Sebastian to the dark side, without cookies,\u201d she said, and the table went silent. \u201cHe, um, bought The Dukes of Hazzard County series and watched it.\u201d</p><p>Christian nodded, and then raised his glass of wine. \u201cBastian\u2019s always been a pop culture buff. Star Trek\u2019s his weakness. Regularly quotes Picard like a good Trekkie.\u201d.</p><p>Like Jules. Ugh. She had to stop thinking of Jules, but she couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking of Sebastian either. So she focused on the man that was real, and in the seat beside her. \u201cYou are? It is? You do?\u201d</p><p>He chewed and chewed, until there couldn\u2019t possibly be any more food in his mouth, before answering. \u201cYes.\u201d Then he twirled another forkful of pasta in a spoon and resumed eating.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoads. Of. Fun.\u201d Christian finished the rest of the bottle and Zoe shot Daisy an apologetic smile.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some dessert?\u201d</p><p>Just as Daisy was about to answer, she happened to glance down at Sebastian\u2019s free hand. It was practically balled into a fist. He was uncomfortable, but she wasn\u2019t sure why. Maybe he and Christian were still on the outs.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a little tired. Today was one of those days, you know?\u201d Not a lie. She\u2019d spent all night tossing and turning, trying to figure out where she\u2019d went wrong with Jules.</p><p>Zoe\u2019s smile turned sympathetic, and then she turned to Sebastian. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead and take Daisy home?\u201d</p><p>Daisy scraped back her chair. \u201cAt least let me help with the dishes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got them,\u201d Zoe said with a wave of her hand and began to rise. \u201cYou two go on.\u201d</p><p>Christian shot to his feet. \u201cSit, love. I\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you cooked,\u201d she protested, her eyes on her husband\u2019s face.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re sleepy.\u201d His gazed dipped to Zoe\u2019s stomach and Daisy barely suppressed a gasp. Her cousin hadn\u2019t had anything to drink, other than water. Instead she grinned, happy as anything for them.</p><p>\u201cI was up late last night writing,\u201d Zoe said, sitting back down again. The unmistakable glow of a pregnant woman shone on her face.</p><p>\u201cA baby,\u201d she whispered to herself. Daisy had always wanted one or two of her own. Growing up as an only child had only reinforced her someday fantasy of a husband and kids. Being alone all the time was overrated in her opinion.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sebastian asked.</p><p>Not wanting to give Zoe and Christian\u2019s secret away before they were ready, she shook her head. \u201cCupcakes. I baked some today. You can have them for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, and after saying good night to Zoe and Christian, they headed back to her apartment.</p><p>Driving around her building to the parking lot in the back, Sebastian parked his car and \u201cHang on a minute and I\u2019ll walk you inside.\u201d</p><p>He opened his door and then opened hers, helping her out.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to have fun tonight,\u201d she said as they walked across the parking lot.</p><p>He spun the keys to his car around his pointer finger. \u201cI\u2019m not known for my hilarity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd things are still tense with Christian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were trying to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one heck of a poker player, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked with a teasing smile.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck, and then opened the door that led to the stairs to her apartment. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I don\u2019t expect you to all chatty with me. Er, the American version, that is,\u201d she said, heated blush rising.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of any other version?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me an example, then.\u201d</p><p>At the top of the landing, after unlocking the door, she turned to face him and rose on the tips of her toes, wrapping her arms around his neck. \u201cSure you don\u2019t want to come inside?\u201d</p><p>A war played out on his face, and she hoped to God that she\u2019d be the winner. \u201cIs this what you thinking chatting is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo an Englishman it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you know of Englishmen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to know I\u2019d like this particular Englishman to spend the night.\u201d She pulled on the back of his neck, but he wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s best if I went back to Christian\u2019s.\u201d His hand came up, stroking the side of her face, and she leaned into his touch.</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d she whispered, pressing a kiss to his throat. She felt him tremble. Peering up at him, his face was a mixture of panic and desire.</p><p>\u201cI know what you think you need, Daisy, but you\u2019d regret it in the morning, and the last thing I ever want to see in your eyes is regret.\u201d</p><p>Kissing his chin, she said, \u201cLet me be the one to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nipping his bottom lip, pulled it into her mouth and sucked. He groaned, his hands coming up to cup the back of her head. \u201cThis is wrong,\u201d he said, but he opened the door to her apartment anyway and pulled her though with him.</p><p>The light on the table she kept in the foyer gave off just the right amount of light for her to see him. She kicked the door closed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a kiss,\u201d he murmured, dipping his head. \u201cNothing more.\u201d</p><p>Their lips met, a slow pass of soft, warm flesh against one another. Her heart sped up, fast as hummingbird wings. Her hand slid down to press against his chest and she smiled. His heart beat faster than hers.</p><p>She teased the seam of his lips open, sliding her tongue inside to touch his. To taste him, like he had done to her so long ago. Slow, wet glides and soft nips of lips and teeth. Her body responded of its own accord, arching against him.</p><p>His fingers tightened in her hair, his free hand gliding down her back to cup her bottom. \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse. Shaky.</p><p>\u201cJust a little bit longer,\u201d she coaxed and he slanted his mouth over hers, searching and wanting, and making her feel exactly how she wanted: desired, beautiful, and sexy.</p><p>Then his kisses turned light, concentrating on the corners of her mouth and the sides of her neck, causing shivers to race up and down her spine. Sebastian would stop soon, she knew this. She also knew she didn\u2019t want him to stop.</p><p>Fumbling with the belt of her wrap dress, she undid the knot and shrugged out of the material, until she stood in nothing but heels and lacy panties. Normally she wore a bra, but tonight she hadn\u2019t and for that she was grateful.</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian pulled away as soon as her dressed pooled around the hand that still cupped her bum. He refused to look any lower than her gorgeous face.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Hating and cursing himself, he replied, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her face paled a little. \u201cAre you worried about the contract we have, because this has nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Glancing away from him, her cheeks heated, \u201cAt the risk of sounding desperate, I want you to stay with me tonight.\u201d Then she looked at him, eyes all dark and vulnerable, mouth trembling. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Jules! I need you! God he wanted to help her, because she needed him as Sebastian. He wanted to stay, but the deception remained.</p><p>\u201cMy heart\u2019s broken, Bastian,\u201d she said, stepping closer to him. \u201cMake me feel better.\u201d</p><p>Still he didn\u2019t look down. \u201cYou want to use me for sex?\u201d</p><p>A bittersweet smile curved her lips. \u201cIsn\u2019t that every man\u2019s fantasy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to use me just for sex. I want you to\u2014\u201d He wanted her to love him, like he did her. This was killing him. He wanted her in the worst way possible, because she made him feel something and forget who he was all at once.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d She took his hand and placed it in the middle of her chest, just where her breasts curved. If he moved even the smallest of distances to the right or left, he would touch her bare skin there, feel her bare nipple as it hardened against his palm.</p><p>He swallowed, desire rushing through him and knocking down every good intention of leaving her the hell alone tonight. \u201cI want to make love to you, like you deserve.\u201d He\u2019d had fantasies about seducing her, with wine and candlelight. With charming conversations and witty sparring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that wasn\u2019t him. He was blunt and no-nonsense. The worst kind of lover in his opinion.</p><p>Her mouth formed a little O. \u201cMake love?\u201d She made the words sound foreign. Maybe her relationship with Glen had been worse than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>Running his knuckles across her cheek, he said, \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever been made love to? Did Glen ever touch you, kiss you and hold you like you were the most precious, sexiest creature ever made? That every part of him was meant to pleasure you, to make you forget everything, but the two of you together...joined in the most intimate of ways.\u201d</p><p>A pink tongue darted out, licking her lip. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAsk me to do all of that, and I\u2019ll stay the night.\u201d</p><p>A heartbeat of hesitation and\u2014\u201cMake love to me, Bastian.\u201d</p><p>He crushed her to him, lifting her up by her thighs as she wrapped her arms around him. He navigated his way to her bed and placed in her in the middle of it, settling his body on top of hers. He braced his elbows on either side of her as he simply gazed at the woman he loved and took in every little detail. The way her hair curled at the ends, the way her eyes were green and brown with tiny flecks of gold, the way her lips parted...the tiny freckle on her cheek. Her perfect for him breasts with pink nipples, the hour-glass curve of her waist, and the plump thighs that gave way to shapely legs.</p><p>His fantasy brought life by a deception he\u2019d perpetrated, but he right now, at this moment, he refused to feel guilty.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking me like that?\u201d she asked, starting up at him.</p><p>Because he would never get this moment back\u2014the first time they made love. Maybe the only time. \u201cBecause you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she ran her fingers down the side of his face. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but smile back. He couldn\u2019t help but kiss her, soft and sweet at first, then fastening his mouth to hers, he became hungry, greedy. He tasted, took and gave. He felt her hands on his shirt, her fingers undoing the buttons and a gasp of surprise.</p><p>\u201cTattoos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore in other places?\u201d she asked between kisses.</p><p>He bit the soft flesh of her ear lobe. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She pushed his shirt off his shoulders, and he undid his cuff-links one awkward hand at a time. His trousers were next to go, then his boxers, socks, and shoes. She wiggled out of her panties.</p><p>\u201cKeep the shoes on,\u201d he ordered gently, and she blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Not until they were touching, hip to hip, chest to chest, legs entwined with one another, did either of them speak.</p> <p>\u201cI have a confession,\u201d she said, not meeting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>She began chewing on the inside of her cheek. \u201cI suck in bed.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, nibbling on her bottom lip. \u201cMen like that, I hear. As for me, I\u2019m an enormous fan of sucking. \u201d</p><p>Laughing, she lightly punched him in the shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Her laughter faded. \u201cGlen said I sucked and he had another woman to compare me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he suck in bed?\u201d Sebastian asked lightly, though inside he wished he had cut off Glen\u2019s testicles and fed them to him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s the only guy I\u2019ve ever been with,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like to go places, so I thought that sucked.\u201d</p><p>He furrowed his brow. \u201cGo what places?\u201d God, this was hard, hearing about how much of an arse her ex-boyfriend had been. Hell, he was hard and trying to have a conversation was incredibly difficult. He wasn\u2019t a slave to lust, but his erection kept brushing at her dark curls. Her nipples scraped at his chest and her hips cradled him perfectly. A dainty foot brushed at his ankle and he took a sustaining breath.</p><p>Her lashes flicked. \u201cDown.\u201d</p><p>Though he caught her meaning, he played dumb and kissed her breasts. \u201cHere?\u201d He teased the tip of one nipple. \u201cWhy would any man not want to suck and nibble on these very perfect pair of breasts?\u201d</p><p>She moaned, \u201cNot there. Lower.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the underside of her breasts, satiny skin scented in vanilla and honey. She tasted divine. Making a wet trail with his tongue, he navigated his way down her stomach, over to her hip, where he scraped his teeth and made her squirm.</p><p>Parted her delicate flesh with his thumbs, he blew lightly. She was swollen and pink. Wet. Hot. \u201cThis low enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever beg me, Daisy,\u201d he growled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a chore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d He kissed a plump thigh. \u201cWash up the dishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss, and then a teasing tip of his tongue to her very swollen clitoris. \u201cHelp you bake a cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastian, pl\u2014now,\u201d she said, her body flushing and knees shaking. \u201cLick me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d He nibbled a path up her neglected thigh and tongued a letter S there. \u201cWhat about here?\u201d Another lick. Oh so close this time to where she was parted\u2014pink and wet for him. \u201cI need very specific directions, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetween where your thumbs are,\u201d she cried, her cheeks pinker than he\u2019d ever seen as she watched him.</p><p>Giving her a wicked grin, he licked her slowly, leisurely. Savoring the tangy sweetness as she shook and moaned. He used his lips, tongue, and teeth to pleasure her.</p><p>\u201cBastian,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut them on me, pull my hair...clutch at my shoulder.\u201d Another lick and she moaned his name again. He loved that sound. He loved her. \u201cNothing is wrong between us.\u201d</p><p>He placed his tongue against her clit and massaged it, then worked a single finger inside of her. Her inner muscles tried to push him out, but he was a patient man and he waited for more of her arousal to coat his finger. However, that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t help things along.</p><p>He sucked her swollen clit into his mouth and her hips jerked against him. This time when he pushed, his finger went deep and he groaned. Her thighs widened and her knees bent. He placed her legs on his shoulders.</p><p>Glancing up, he watched her eyes widen. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. You\u2019ll like it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cBe as loud or as quiet as you want.\u201d Then he lowered his mouth and started at the beginning.</p><p>She screamed and tugged on his hair as she shook. \u201cOh God...I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>And she did, long and loudly. Music to his ears and his heart. He was pleasuring her, this woman he loved. He was giving her everything she needed, and she needed him.</p><p>\u201cInside me,\u201d she panted. \u201cI need you inside me.\u201d Grabbing a condom from the drawer of the nightstand, she practically threw it at him. He opened the foil and rolled it on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pierced there?\u201d</p><p>Peering at her, he grinned wickedly. \u201cIt appears so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I felt something.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the base of his erection and rubbed it against her. She fell back, her back arching and her thigh widening to accommodate him. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She tugged at his shoulder, urging him on. Slowly, he entered her, the blunt head of him stretching her. She made a little noise, her face contorting slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re very big.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her nose. \u201cAnd you\u2019re very tight.\u201d A quick roll of his hips and he was seated halfway inside. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>Eyes glazed with passion blinked up at him. \u201cFeels too good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo such thing.\u201d He withdrew a little and then thrust inside. Hard. She grabbed his shoulder and dug her nails into the skin. He hissed in pleasure. So much pleasure. So much everything.</p><p>Nothing had ever felt so good, and he didn\u2019t think it was only the physical aspect of it. No, he knew it was the emotional aspect. He was making love to Daisy.</p><p>She whispered his name, sex words, and how much she loved what he was doing. But not him. She didn\u2019t love him. She didn\u2019t know him.</p><p>It would have to suffice.</p><p>Instead of dwelling on what she didn\u2019t feel, he concentrated on what he could make her feel. He concentrated on her, on every sigh, every moan, and every flutter her lashes made. He rocked inside of her, rolling his hips... withdrawing and reentering with measured thrusts.</p><p>\u201cDo you like this?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d Her eyes went wide. \u201cOh God. I love that.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head to the pillow, just beside hers, and breathed her in, his body at her command. And it felt so damn good to do it. It felt so damn good to feel her sweat slick skin sliding against his, her pants against his shoulder and her hands on his body. She stroked his back, grabbed his shoulders, and wrapped her legs around his waist, high heeled shoes scraping his ass.</p><p>\u201cI think I have to come again,\u201d she said, bewilderment in her tone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head for a moment, keeping his body moving exactly how she wanted. \u201cThen come. I can wait.\u201d</p><p>The beginnings of a sweet smile began to grace her lips, then he slipped his hand between them and rubbed her where she was wet and swollen.</p><p>Her mouth opened wide on a gasp. His name on her lips.</p><p>That was all he needed, his orgasm taking over, making him lose control, not caring about tempo or thrust. Just the nearly mindless pumping of his hips that had him shouting her name.</p><p>Daisy came back down to earth, like a feather floating on the breeze. She was boneless, sore, and satisfied. Unable to stop, she pressed kisses to her lover\u2019s neck and jaw. He smiled against her skin and rolled off her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been kidding when he said he wanted to make love to her, to focus on her pleasure...her everything. She\u2019d never felt so loved. It was a little strange, if she had to be honest, because she knew Glen had loved her and she\u2019d loved him, yet sex had never felt like this.</p><p>Sebastian did everything she liked, asked questions, and expected answers.</p><p>And the way he\u2019d looked at her, the way he touched her...if she didn\u2019t know any better, she would have thought that he was sweet on her. Maybe even more than sweet...maybe\u2014his fingers brushed hers and she felt him curl his hand over hers.</p><p>She smiled and closed her eyes, laying there beside him for what seemed like hours. It didn\u2019t matter that he didn\u2019t talk. Heck, she didn\u2019t feel like talking.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to be held now or shall I dispose of the condom, first?\u201d he asked and she turned her attention to him, his lickable tattooed chest and hard abs slowly rising and falling, while he stared up at the ceiling.</p><p>Pulling her hand away, she switched on the light beside the bed. \u201cUh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I can leave if you like.\u201d He sounded like he was ready to leave. He sounded like he\u2019d lied to her about the whole heart-stopping, panty-melting let me make love to you speech.</p><p>Oh God. The realization of what she\u2019d done hit her, making her body actually ache. She\u2019d just slept with a man that she didn\u2019t know, the day after she\u2019d been dumped, and oh yeah, he was paying her to be with him.</p><p>\u201cDaisy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever,\u201d she said, trying to sound cool and calm while inside she raged and wanted to crawl into a hole for being so dumb. For being so unlike herself.</p><p>He turned to look at her, his face unreadable. \u201cI think I\u2019ve said something wrong, but I\u2019m not sure what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t what you said; it was how you said it.\u201d She blew out a breath. \u201cOkay, so it was what you said, too.\u201d She covered her eyes with a hand and waited for him to get up, but the bed didn\u2019t move. She peeked through her fingers. He still lay there, sexy as anything, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cMy confession: I suck at the what-to-do-after-sex part,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cIf you would explain your preferences, I\u2019d gladly put them in action.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, all the doubt, all the anger, and all the self-loathing melted away, like a bowl of sorbet sitting in the summertime sun. \u201cWell, it was nice when you held my hand.\u201d Immediately, he grabbed her hand again, and she smiled. \u201cI bet you want to use my bathroom.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, he let go of her hand and rose from the bed.</p><p>Daisy had the pleasure of watching walk across her apartment, his stride purposeful, the large tattoo of his last name on his back rippling as he stretched along the way.</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>A minute later, he walked back to her, his body lickable no matter which way he was facing. And dear God, was he built. Everywhere. The piercing didn\u2019t hurt things at all. He paused at the foot of the bed. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>In answer, she held her arms open. He practically jumped on the bed and gathered her to him as he asked, \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She kissed him and rested her head on his chest, tracing the outline of a star tattoo. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have one here?\u201d She lightly touched the space over his heart.</p><p>\u201cOut of respect,\u201d came his cryptic answer.</p><p>\u201cDo your tattoos mean anything?\u201d There were stars, skulls, knives, and words written in languages she couldn\u2019t read, beautiful but deadly looking.</p><p>His pale eyes found hers. \u201cThey mean I survived.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Sensing the need to change the subject, Daisy held up her hand and examined the ring Sebastian had given her. \u201cThis is very pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. Actually, I bought it with you in mind.

We\u2019ll take off at seven.\u201d He rolled her under him and she was astonished to find him hard. \u201cI know how we can spend the duration of the flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared of flying,\u201d she whispered, even as her body responded to the slow caresses he\u2019d started giving it.</p><p>His hand drifted lower, to between her thighs, and he slid a finger inside of her. She sucked in air. \u201cI\u2019ll take very good care of you,\u201d he murmured, dipping his head to her chest. Using his teeth, he tugged on a nipple, and then swirled his tongue around it. \u201cSay yes.\u201d</p><p>Another finger joined in, his thumb pressing on her clitoris and he sucked her nipple deep inside his hot mouth. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Daisy woke to Sebastian gently shaking her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re starting our descent.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked up at him, then yawned and rubbed her eyes. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Instead of him taking very good care of her, she\u2019d ended up taking a sleeping pill and crashed on his couch about thirty minutes into the flight. The last thing she remembered talking about was the Church of St. Clemmons.</p><p>\u201cFour-thirty AM your time. Nine-thirty mine,\u201d he said with a rueful grin. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d The plane bounced, and then slowed as it taxied on the runway. Pressing her nose against the closest window, she took in the sight of Heathrow Airport. \u201cIt seems like I just got on the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile for me, it was endless torture of you humming in your sleep,\u201d he said and she turned to face him, giving him a come-on look</p><p>\u201cHumming in my sleep?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe me, eh?\u201d He unbuckled his seatbelt and joined her on the sofa. \u201cI videoed you with my mobile.\u201d His thumb glided over the screen of his cell.</p><p>Her mouth fell open. There she lay, alternately mumbling and humming in her sleep. \u201cThat\u2019s so wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said and she lightly punched him in the shoulder as he pocketed his cell. \u201cWatch it. Very fragile equipment could be damaged.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOops.\u201d Splaying her fingers, she admired her pretty ring. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll be more careful with your jewelry.\u201d</p><p>Taking her hand, he kissed the tip of each finger. \u201cI meant these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed, so charmed by him that she couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say.</p><p>\u201cCome here, beautiful,\u201d he said with a smile. She scrambled to him, throwing her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worried about me messing up your suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s enough starch in this to withstand even your pawing,\u201d he said dryly, and then pressed a kiss onto the top of her head.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cBetter watch it. Or else.\u201d</p><p>A familiar, smug look came over him, one she called his I\u2019m-the-earl-and-you-must-quiver-before-me look. Only she quivered for entirely different reasons. \u201cElse what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. More. Cupcakes. For. You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruel, Miss Barnes. Doing away with my daily cupcake ration is in violation of the Geneva Conventions.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am always serious, darling,\u201d he said with a frown, but his eyes twinkled as he lifted her from his lap and stood. \u201cAh, the limo is here. Customs first though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I have something to tell you,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone claiming to be your mother has been emailing me and wanting to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrist, squeezing. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Daisy stepped into him, tracing the pattern of his tie with the fingers of her free hand. His grip lessened, but the look on his face chilled her. \u201cI blocked her as spam, but I thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have your email account monitored.\u201d He pulled his cell from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Thumb frozen over the screen, he blinked at her. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmails are private, unless you\u2019d let me monitor yours,\u201d she said, letting her arm fall and pulling her wrist out of his grasp. She grabbed her purse as the plane came to a stop.</p><p>\u201cOut of the question,\u201d he snapped before nodding at the flight attendant to open the door to the plane.</p><p>They descended the stairs, and with every step, Sebastian\u2019s stance became more rigid. When he paused at the bottom to offer her his hand, she almost stumbled at what she saw. Face tight, eyes like glaciers and a little sneer in his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked softly, then slipped her hand in his, or tried to. He directed her fingers to his elbow, like they were at a fancy party.</p><p>He paused. \u201cLook, in Holland Springs, I was more...relaxed than usual.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open slightly. He\u2019d been relaxed? \u201cIs that why you won\u2019t hold my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in nursery school, darling,\u201d he said as custom officers came to them, with their equipment and questions.</p><p>Hurt rose inside of her, swift and deep. What did nursery school have to do with hand holding? And where had the man whose lap she\u2019d sat in on the plane gone? The man who had said that Jules Westmoreland\u2014wait a minute...How did he know Jules\u2019 last name?</p><p>Her diamond flashed along with the unmistakable click of cameras, pulling her out of her thoughts.</p><p>Oh, yeah, the man she\u2019d slept with was her fake fianc\u00e9. Emphasis on the word fake.</p><p>He\u2019d placed her hand directly in the line of sight for the paparazzi watching them. She couldn\u2019t forget that. No matter how amazing the sex, how charming or sweet he could be to her, (and apparently only in private or back home), this relationship of theirs wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak again, until they were in the limo, and that was only to inform her where they would be going first\u2014his house in Mayfair on Berkley Square. Then his phone rang and for the next three minutes, she listened with half an ear to his conversation, then directed her attention to what was outside her window.</p><p>The limo practically flew past pastures, then streets, houses, and shops. A traffic snarl and his sudden silence had her fiddling with her engagement ring.</p><p>\u201cDaisy,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt your feelings, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up a hand, then lowered it and took a deep breath. \u201cYou can\u2019t apologize then qualify it with a \u2018but\u2019. It makes it meaningless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rarely apologize.\u201d</p><p>Tilting her head to one side, she frowned. \u201cIs that supposed to make me feel special?\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned before he went straight back to work on his phone. She sighed and lurched forward, then back against the leather seat when the limo took a left. She heard a sharp crack and part of her bun went all loose.</p><p>\u201cDang it,\u201d she said as she tried to fix her hair. Unfortunately, she came back with half a chopstick. The light green ones were her lucky pair. She pulled out the other one and tucked them in her purse. Guess they weren\u2019t so lucky anymore.</p><p>Sebastian cleared his throat and she glanced up at him. He held his hand over his phone. \u201cSorry, but could you keep it down? I\u2019m on a very important conference call.\u201d</p><p>Her phone vibrated in her coat pocket and she fished for it, snagging it with the tips of her fingers. Better to answer that than him, because she did not have very nice things to say.</p><p>Isabella: Sunny in the tropics. \uf04a How are things with S?</p><p>Her frown gave way to a real smile. Isabella had added a picture of herself posing by the pool with a couple of hot lifeguards.</p><p>Daisy: Fine. Making friends, I see. ;)</p><p>Isabella: Yep, from yesterday. Ack! Why are you up?</p><p>Daisy: I\u2019m in London with the earl of crap apologies. Why are you up?</p><p>Isabella: Getting ready for bed. Don\u2019t judge. Plane leaves early tomorrow. Also, London??? Crap apologies???</p><p>Daisy: Not even. Did you ever mention Jules\u2019s last name to Sebastian?</p><p>Isabella: No.</p><p>Daisy: K. Maybe Zoe did. Anyway, be safe. Will email you all the details later. K?</p><p>Isabella: Fine. *pouts* Better be some juicy ones! Xoxo</p><p>Daisy: Night. Xoxo</p><p>\u201cAt least someone is making you smile,\u201d Sebastian said and Daisy jerked her head up.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know Jules\u2019 last name was Westmoreland?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Before he could answer, the limo came to a stop. A doorman rushed over and opened the car door. Guess she\u2019d have to ask him again later. She shivered in the cold morning, glancing up at the imposing building. \u201cIs this your house?\u201d</p><p>He placed one foot out of the limo, and then paused. \u201cNo, I\u2019m headed to work. Henshaw will see you to Number Forty-Eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just leaving me alone? In a place I\u2019ve never been before? Without friends or family? Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Daisy. Calm down. You\u2019re in London, not some third world country.\u201d He got out of the car and bent down slightly. \u201cSee you for dinner tonight.\u201d His cold eyes travelled over her. \u201cConsider something different than what you\u2019d usually wear.\u201d</p><p>The door shut, while her mouth dropped open. \u201cI\u2019m totally cutting you off from cupcakes and me,\u201d she finally managed, watching through the tinted glass as he walked away.</p><p>That was not well done of him.</p><p>Sebastian pressed the button for the top floor and waited, mentally berating himself. Would it have hurt to see her home himself? Or even to have spent the day with her, showing her around London?</p><p>She\u2019d talked non-stop about all the places she wanted to go before falling asleep mid-sentence. Tourist traps, the lot of them. However, he could have taken the time with her, playing the part of fantastically in love man while actually being a fantastically in love man.</p><p>However, there was work to be done. The multiple phone calls he\u2019d received had reminded him of that. It was familiar. Purposeful. Nothing had changed there.</p><p>Romanov Industries still needed him, even if he had been voted out. He was still the go-to guy. Years of grooming by his father had seen to that.</p><p>Perfection, drive, and a firm dedication to the family business were top priorities. Little time spent pursuing anything else, unless it benefitted Romanov.</p><p>So polo matches and football teams were turned from great fun into business deals. Though he did love to win, and win often he did. Consideration, of course, was always given to the Princes. Never play better than Royalty does, even if you\u2019re on the same team.</p><p>The lift doors opened and he stepped out. \u201cAh, there you are, Mr. Romanov,\u201d his secretary said, blackberry in hand.</p><p>Striding towards his office, he nodded at his office staff. \u201cCancel my six o\u2019clock meeting with Meldinski. Reschedule for tomorrow at nine,\u201d Sebastian said as they entered his office. The first thing he had done after his father had passed was to move Romanov Industries to this block of Berkley Square. All ten thousand square feet of fully staffed modern and classic office space.</p><p>\u201cVery good, sir. I\u2019ll leave you to your tea.\u201d His secretary quit the room.</p><p>A butler brought in a tray of tea and scones, placing it on a table near the window. Routine. Efficiency. Thank God for it.</p><p>Though as he bit into one, he couldn\u2019t help but compare it to Daisy\u2019s sweets. Maybe he could get her to try making some for him.</p><p>He made a noise. Doubtful, since he\u2019d royally mucked things up. The butler would sooner tap dance his way out of Sebastian\u2019s office.</p><p>Perhaps he should offer an olive branch. He pulled his mobile out of his pocket.</p><p>You may take a nap in any bedroom you choose \u2013S Especially his, he wanted to add, but didn\u2019t.</p><p>Less than a minute later came her reply: That\u2019s so generous of you ~D</p><p>Yep, he was an ass, and he had to think of an explanation for how he knew Jules\u2019s last name. He was pretty damn sure she wouldn\u2019t go for his Zoe told me, and he suspected she\u2019d already quizzed Isabella about it.</p><p>Pocketing his phone, he exhaled.</p><p>A discreet knock on his office door and it opened. His best mate, Liam Stewart, strode in with a grim look on his face.</p><p>\u201cSebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHullo, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCancel whatever plans you have for the next day and a half, we\u2019ve meetings with Liang Technologies and need to prepare.\u201d</p><p>Successful negotiations with the Hong Kong based company would greatly improve his standings with the Board. \u201cOf course.\u201d Guilt pricked at him like sharp needles of a cactus. He would have to find something for Daisy to do while he closed this deal. \u201cIs Verity in the country?\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head. \u201cLeft this morning. Why?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian set down his cup of tea. \u201cThought she could spend time with Daisy, maybe give her a tour of all the tourist traps.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI forgot about your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d Liam poured himself a cup of tea, adding sugar and a lemon. \u201cHave her taken to The Hall, or the dowager\u2019s house. Your mother would be thrilled to meet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet my mother? You can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be President again or not?\u201d</p> <p>Sebastian clenched his jaw. \u201cMy mother has been emailing Daisy, which made my fianc\u00e9e uncomfortable.\u201d That was putting it mildly. She\u2019d seemed genuinely upset and had handled his asinine response with her usual finesse and sweetness, until he\u2019d refused to hold her hand. Something so simple, yet he\u2019d been so furious he didn\u2019t trust himself to touch her again.</p><p>\u201cShall I have her email monitored?\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of his tongue to say yes, but he couldn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t violate Daisy privacy or ignore her wishes. \u201cNo need. She sent the woman to spam.\u201d A smile kicked up the corners of his mouth. \u201cImagine, Lady Francesca, eldest daughter of the Duke of Everham, denied entry into an inbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201d Liam grinned, his dark eyes crinkling at the corners. \u201cWhen do I get to meet this Daisy of yours?\u201d</p><p>Daisy of yours? Sebastian picked up his cup of tea again. He liked the sound of it. His Daisy. \u201cShall we get everyone together at G.R.\u2019s to celebrate my engagement and successful negations?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPositive visualization\u2014I like it.\u201d Liam finished his tea and set it down on the tray. He straightened his tie. \u201cLet me pop down to my office, get the paperwork we need on my end, and meet you in conference room three in about fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian moved to his desk, clicked on Outlook, and began to read his emails. \u201cSee you then.\u201d Liam exited the room, the door closing with a soft click.</p><p>Ten minutes had passed before he remembered he needed to inform Daisy of his plans. God, she was going to be furious with him, possibly hurt. Although she was already mad enough at him not to even care if she didn\u2019t see him for a couple of days.</p><p>Still...</p><p>Change of plans. You\u2019ll need to find something to do today, tonight, and most of tomorrow. Dinner with my friends has been moved to Wednesday night at seven thirty. I have business meetings that cannot be missed. Shall I arrange a tour for you?-S</p><p>There. He\u2019d informed her of his plans and now she could make her own, with any help from him she needed.</p> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Daisy stared at Sebastian\u2019s latest text. Was he serious? He was going to leave her alone for the next two days? To do what? Oh yeah, take a tour he would arrange for her.</p><p>Bless his heart.</p><p>No thank you. Have fun at your playdate. Tell the other dictators I said hi and you suck. ~D</p><p>Crap. Not he sucked, which he did, but the other guys. Not you suck, btw. They suck. ~D</p><p>&gt;:-S</p><p>Whether or not he meant to be funny, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>The maid showed her to one of the six guestrooms in the five-story mansion. Another servant, dressed in a dark suit, brought up her suitcases and set them on a low dresser.</p> <p>\u201cShall I unpack for you, ma\u2019am?\u201d the maid asked with a smile.</p><p>Daisy returned her smile. \u201cNo, thank you. But could you tell me what\u2019s the best way to tour London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I wouldn\u2019t know, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks anyway,\u201d Daisy said as the maid left the room.</p><p>Sighing, Daisy padded to one of several windows overlooking a green square with several huge trees, heavy with green leaves. Men, women, and families walked around. A few gathered in small clusters in the shade of the trees.</p><p>Maybe she could join them.</p><p>The nap she thought she had to have was replaced by the thrill of being in a foreign land, doing foreign things, and loving every minute of it.</p><p>\u201cConquer the bucket list,\u201d she sang.</p><p>After taking care of her most pressing needs, she grabbed her coat and purse, and headed downstairs. Just as she opened the front door, the bodyguard she\u2019d met in Holland Springs intercepted her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked, his accent thick. Russian, she\u2019d bet.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cTo the park across the street, and then who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know.\u201d Leather creaked as he crossed his arms.</p><p>Her smile faded. \u201cI can\u2019t just explore and see where the day takes me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She tried again. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Romanov would fire me, if I let you go...exploring.\u201d</p><p>Well, she didn\u2019t want to get the man fired and she understood that here things would be different. Like Sebastian had been. But understanding and actually experiencing were two very different things. \u201cOkay. Well, I guess I\u2019ll figure out my itinerary and give it to you.\u201d So much for spontaneity.</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cAnd clear it with Mr. Romanov.\u201d</p><p>Clear it? Like she had to have his approval? She opened her mouth to argue again.</p><p>\u201cMr. Romanov values your safety above his own. He left me here with you, instead of Boris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better than Boris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa. I trained Boris.\u201d</p><p>Though she knew she shouldn\u2019t be swayed by that, she felt the tiniest bit of anger and resentment slip away. \u201cThen shouldn\u2019t he be just as good as you?\u201d</p><p>His jaw worked. \u201cI\u2019m still the teacher and he\u2019s still the student.\u201d</p><p>Well, she couldn\u2019t argue with that logic. \u201cIt would have been nice to have been told all this ahead of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa. Make your plans, Countess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a countess.\u201d She never would be.</p><p>\u201cYou will be.\u201d His mouth twitched. A smile maybe? \u201cI\u2019ll take you where you want to go. Mr. Romanov left a credit card for you to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her heart felt heavy as she jogged back up the stairs and walked inside her room. Pulling out her phone, one that Sebastian had equipped with a new sim card, she began searching for and saving all the places she wanted to see.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she\u2019d made her list and texted it to Sebastian, since she didn\u2019t have his email address.</p><p>Have fun \u2013S</p><p>I will. Your bodyguard\u2019s a riot. ~D</p><p>I don\u2019t pay Ivan to be funny. I pay him to keep you safe \u2013S</p><p>You paid me to be your fianc\u00e9e, which meant spending time with you, not your bodyguard. ~D</p><p>And why are we still ending our texts with our initials? I know it\u2019s you. You know it\u2019s me. ~ D</p><p>&gt;:-S</p><p>Setting her purse on the dresser, she removed her wallet and stuck it, along with her phone, into her coat pocket. Determined to make the most of her trip, she marched to the door, down the hallway and the stairs, calling out Ivan\u2019s name when she reached the bottom floor.</p><p>The enormous bodyguard appeared, sunglasses on, weapon concealed, and leather coat creaking. \u201cWhere to first, Countess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Tower,\u201d she said as he opened her door. \u201cI want to see if they have any vacancies.\u201d</p><p>It was nearly midnight when Sebastian arrived home. He trudged up the stairs, rubbing the back of his neck. For the time being, everything was going according to plan. Liang Technology wanted to do business with Romanov Industries. The details merely had to be worked out. But the devil usually cropped up in those, so he had to be wary and hire his own translators to make sure the agreement would be profitable for both companies.</p><p>He blinked, his jaw cracking on a yawn. He needed to sleep and check on Daisy. The report from Ivan said they\u2019d visited the Palace today and the Tower. Though he hadn\u2019t needed one from his bodyguard.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Daisy had texted him at every opportunity, usually with a picture attached. His favorite was of The Tower, her standing beside it and holding a sign that read, Vacancy. Earls Only.</p><p>God love her.</p><p>A grin kicked up the corners of his mouth as he made his way down the hall to his room. Perhaps he could find a way to have breakfast with her in the morning.</p><p>The soft glow of light from one of his guestroom caught his attention and he strode to the door. Knocking softly, it swung open.</p><p>\u201cDaisy?\u201d he called out, then stepped inside and found her asleep in bed, arms and legs sprawled. Black lashes fanned her cheeks and all her gorgeous hair confined in a fat braid, bright colors weaving in and out.</p><p>An odd pang hit him. He\u2019d missed her, he realized. He\u2019d truly missed spending the day with her. Tomorrow evening he would make it up to her, and then spend the rest of her stay making it up to her.</p><p>Only he had to get through these negotiations first. He rubbed the back of his neck. There was always something interfering with his best-laid plans. He flicked his gaze to her sleeping form, highlighted by moonlight. Or by someone.</p><p>Leaning down, he pulled the covers up to her shoulders, turned off the bedside lamp, and tucked an errant curl behind her ear. \u201cGood night,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Daisy made a small noise, her eyes blinking sleepily. \u201cSebastian?\u201d</p><p>Now was his chance. He could apologize properly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being such an arse to you. You didn\u2019t deserve it and I hope you\u2019ll find a way to forgive me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cHmpf. You only want my cupcakes. Off with your head,\u201d she said with a frown on her full lips.</p><p>He bit the inside of his cheek to stop himself from laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll try again later, my queen of hearts.\u201d</p><p>She turned over with a huff, presenting him with the back of her head. Though he wanted to kiss her, he refrained. Instead he stood and shoved his hands in his pockets. With a great sigh, he left her room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re who again?\u201d Daisy asked, unable not to stare at the woman she\u2019d been summoned to meet in the first floor reception room.</p><p>Sweeping off her hat, the tall woman with hair the color of coffee beans smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Kate von Lichtenstein, a close friend of the Romanovs, and I\u2019ve come to take you shopping.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, she\u2019d been right. Every woman in England had been named Kate.</p><p>\u201cSebastian sent you to help me pick out a new wardrobe?\u201d Daisy asked. Was she supposed to start dressing like this chick? Not that she would mind, really. Kate\u2019s dress was gorgeous and...Daisy peered more closely at her. Kate looked really familiar.</p><p>Unfortunately, Daisy\u2019s mind blanked when she tried to place her face. Mostly because she\u2019d just woken up thirty minutes ago, after a restless night of sleep, and hadn\u2019t eaten breakfast yet. She hadn\u2019t seen Sebastian this morning either. Guess he wasn\u2019t ready to apologize to her again when she wasn\u2019t half-asleep, or explain himself.</p><p>Earlier, Ivan had informed her that Mr. Romanov had come home at midnight, then left again at five. His normal hours. There was nothing normal about working a body to death. And for the first time since they\u2019d arrived, a big part of her had felt sorry for him. Romanov Industries was all he had left of his family.</p><p>\u201cNot precisely.\u201d Kate\u2019s gaze skittered and her smile fell away.</p><p>Now this was interesting. \u201cWould Sebastian be happy if I went with you?\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s shoulders dropped a little. \u201cNot precisely.\u201d</p><p>Even more interesting. Maybe Kate could give her some tips about what to wear to dinner tonight. And right now, the last thing she wanted to do was to make Sebastian happy. Although she wasn\u2019t setting out to make him unhappy. Heck, she wasn\u2019t even that mad at him anymore. He\u2019d apologized and this was his life. She was only his fake fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps this wasn\u2019t such a great idea, after all,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>Grabbing Kate\u2019s hand, she gave it a little squeeze. \u201cWe\u2019re totally going shopping. Right after I eat breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Daisy and Kate made their way down High Street, window shopping, until Kate found the perfect shop and pulled Daisy inside.</p><p>\u201cChampagne, please,\u201d Kate called out to the sales clerk, and then she turned to Daisy \u201cLet me see your ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pink and chocolate diamond,\u201d Daisy said, not really knowing how much she should share about her engagement, as she held it out for Kate\u2019s inspection. \u201cSebastian said he thought I\u2019d like it, because the diamonds around the middle looked like bits of frosting.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s assessing gaze found hers. \u201cDid he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d</p><p>Daisy let her hand fall. She adjusted one of her chopsticks and looked around the shop. She blinked, twice. \u201cKate,\u201d she loudly whispered. \u201cWhere are the price tags?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future Countess of Spenserfield has no need to concern herself with price tags,\u201d Kate informed her. She passed her a glass of champagne and held up her glass. \u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>Belatedly remembering the black American Express card Sebastian had left for her, Daisy smashed her lips together. Yep, she was fitting right in.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>Lifting her glass to Kate, she copied her, and then drank the entire thing.</p><p>\u201cWould you like another?\u201d Kate asked, jade-colored eyes wide.</p><p>Daisy hiccupped. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you call him Sebastian instead of his nickname?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get right to the point, don\u2019t you?\u201d Daisy smiled. \u201cSebastian must love having you for a friend.\u201d</p><p>Kate seemed to flinch when Daisy had said love, but she wasn\u2019t really sure. \u201cBastian loves many things, but none of them include me.\u201d She grabbed a dress off the rack and held it up to Daisy. \u201cThis would be perfect for your first dinner out together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should wear this tonight?\u201d Daisy wasn\u2019t sure. The dress was a little old fashioned, the pattern heavy and not at all her style. The most it had going for it was that it looked elegant, but she didn\u2019t want to embarrass Sebastian or herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBastian would love it on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t want to wear the wrong thing, but this dress is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kate made a noise of dismissal. \u201cTrust me.\u201d Smiling, she took a sip of champagne. \u201cNow, tell me all about how the two of you met.\u201d</p> <p>Daisy panicked. She and Sebastian hadn\u2019t really been over this. Why hadn\u2019t they been over this? \u201cWe met Christmas before last, when he came to town to see Rose Holland.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cThe two of you started dating, then?\u201d she asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked how we met, not when we started dating,\u201d Daisy pointed out.</p> <p>Kate blinked, her cheeks coloring little. \u201cSo I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ah...the next time I saw him, he...We fell in love, just like that.\u201d Daisy snapped her fingers. \u201cNext thing I know, he\u2019s proposing and I said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSebastian Romanov spontaneously proposed to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, trying to sound convincing. Lying had never been something she\u2019d been good at doing. \u201cIt was very romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomantic?\u201d Kate\u2019s jade-colored eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you quite sure we\u2019re talking about the same man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d Daisy said, starting for the counter with the dress. Ivan waited near the register, and she breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>\u201cCountess?\u201d His gaze swept the area before settling on Daisy.</p><p>\u201cAfter I pay for this, I\u2019ll be ready to go back home,\u201d she said, walking faster. A light pressure on her arm made her pause.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Daisy. I\u2019m being rather horrid to you, all in the name of protecting my friend,\u201d Kate said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go. Let\u2019s spend the rest of the day getting to know one another, and perhaps in the future, the two of us could be good friends as well.\u201d</p><p>In the not-so-distant future, Daisy and Sebastian would no longer be engaged. Would Kate want to be her good friend after that? She didn\u2019t want to be rude, but she was pretty sure that one of two things would happen as the day wore on:</p><p>One: She would snap at Kate, because she was grumpy and tired, and not in the mood for twenty questions.</p><p>Two: She would discover that Kate was in love with Sebastian, which he obviously didn\u2019t return, since he hadn\u2019t asked Kate to be his fianc\u00e9e. Or worse, he didn\u2019t know Kate loved him. Then she\u2019d feel lower than low for lying about everything.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not in the best mood right now. I\u2019m tired and grumpy. How about you come to dinner with us, instead?\u201d Daisy gave the woman a gentle smile. \u201cI\u2019ll text you when I find out the place and time.\u201d</p><p>Kate considered her offer for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re going to G.R.\u2019s\u2014Sebastian personally knows the man. Text me the time when you get a chance.\u201d Leaning in, Kate bussed Daisy cheek. \u201cSo very nice to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>Sebastian knew G.R., too? Wasn\u2019t this a small world.</p><p>A wave of dread washed over Daisy. Something wasn\u2019t right. Sebastian needed to explain how he knew Jules\u2019s last name.</p><p>She could ask Kate, but she was afraid of the answers she\u2019d get. Instead, she waved good-bye and watched Kate leave the store.</p><p>By tonight, after dinner\u2014she could give him that long\u2014, Sebastian had better be ready to tell her everything.</p><p>Fishing her phone out of her purse, she wavered on contacting Jules, then...</p><p>I miss you.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s other phone buzzed and he picked it up, reading the text Daisy had sent to Jules. Closing his eyes, he leaned back his chair and pinched the bridge of his nose.</p><p>She missed him.</p><p>Even after the email Jules had sent her, even after the night she\u2019d shared with him, Daisy still wanted Jules. How in the hell could he compete with an online version of himself?</p><p>She thought him to be stiff, formal, arrogant, and unyielding. He was those things, but those few adjectives weren\u2019t the entire sum of his parts. There was so much more to his personality he was dying to show her, but fear held him back. The fear she\u2019d discover he was a fraud and would think he\u2019d been playing with her emotions all along.</p><p>He guessed it was time to pay the piper, and tell her the truth. She deserved the truth. She deserved the best of everything, even if the best didn\u2019t include him anymore.</p><p>Texting his driver, he made his way to the parking garage underneath the building, slipped inside his car and nearly fell into the backseat, after Boris closed the door behind him. He was exhausted, mentally and physically.</p><p>Tonight he would wine and dine Daisy, introduce her to his best mate, his friends, and G.R. Later when she was happy, rested, and hopefully comfortable, he would tell her the truth.</p><p>Decision made, he headed home, heart heavy.</p><p>Yet as he strode inside, anticipation flowed through him. The earth tilted on its axis, his palms grew damp, and his breathing became erratic. Daisy glided down the stairs in a lovely coat that hid her dress from him, but not her shapely legs. Her hair was styled in an elegant up-do.</p><p>Yet, she felt nothing for him. Only Jules.</p><p>She smiled, her pretty eyes crinkling at the corners, and he stopped thinking about her feelings for Jules. Hell, he stopped thinking at all.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, coming to a stop a couple of feet in front of him. \u201cYou look nice.\u201d</p><p>His heart skipped a beat. \u201cThank you.\u201d Then he noticed the three-inch heels she wore and his gut clinched. \u201cI brought you something.\u201d He procured the rectangular box from his suit jacket and held it out. \u201cWear them tonight.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance flashed in those hazel eyes. \u201cYes, milord.\u201d She dropped him a curtsy and took the box. \u201cMay I open it now, or should I wait for you to count to three first?\u201d</p><p>He deserved that, he supposed, for his high-handedness. \u201cYou may open it whenever you like.\u201d Of course, that was so much better.</p><p>She placed a hand over her heart. \u201cThank you for giving me permission.\u201d</p><p>Rocking back on his heels, he clenched his jaw. This was not how he envisioned tonight. \u201cDaisy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, still holding on the box from Bulgari. \u201cYou came bearing gifts of apology and I\u2019m went all grumpy cat on you.\u201d</p><p>He almost laughed, but would she believe Sebastian knew anything about that damn cat? Not likely. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is \u2018grumpy cat\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold this.\u201d After giving him back the unopened box, she whipped out her phone, thumbs flying over the screen. \u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><p>Their fingers brushed as they traded phone for box. Briefly their eyes met, sparks of want in her gaze. \u201cNow will you open my gift for you?\u201d he asked, his voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, he wished he\u2019d asked an entirely different question that could elicit that exact response. Something along the lines of\u2014Do you want to skip dinner and head straightaway to bed, with me?</p><p>He turned his attention to her phone. While he perused pictures of the especially unhappy looking cat, she opened the box. \u201cHonestly, I fail to see what this cat has to be so grumpy about. He has his picture taken on a daily basis, inside mind you, and seems to be well-fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are beautiful,\u201d she breathed, paying no mind at his failed attempt at humor. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you noticed I\u2019d broken my lucky pair.\u201d</p><p>How could he not notice everything about her? \u201cI\u2019m quite good at multi-tasking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you put them in?\u201d Turning, she waited for him, but all he could do was stare in horror at her hair. All the colors were gone, stripped from the ends. \u201cDo you like my new \u2018do\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very pretty.\u201d His hands shook as he carefully placed the diamond and jade chopsticks in her elegant bun. \u201cDone,\u201d he said and she whirled around, her eyes dancing in excitement.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me we were going to G.R.\u2019s restaurant?\u201d</p><p>Why had she changed her hair color? \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was important,\u201d he said as they walked arm in arm to the waiting car. Had she got it in her head that he didn\u2019t like her hair? All over his consider wearing something different remark. If she had, he was going to shave his head in mourning.</p><p>\u201cNot important? It\u2019s G.R.!\u201d she said, getting in the car. \u201cHe\u2019s world famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had known you were such a fan, then I would have arranged for a private dinner for the two of you,\u201d he said dryly as he joined her. The door closed behind him and the car merged into traffic. \u201cInstead you\u2019ll have to settle for me and a few of my friends. Maybe I can get G.R. to make an appearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want dinner with G.R., I want cooking classes.\u201d She unbuttoned her coat and placed her hands in her lap, fingers clutching at a small purse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already a fantastic cook, Daisy.\u201d</p><p>Smiling at him, she fiddled with the beading on her purse. \u201cThank you, but I want to be even better. I love learning new techniques and dishes. Once I get them down, I try to put my own spin on it. But sometimes, you can\u2019t improve perfection.\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her, taking in her smile, her beautiful face, her sexy body, and every inch of perfection that was Daisy Barnes. \u201cIndeed you cannot.\u201d</p><p>They both grew quiet and he was content just to ride with her, breath in the scent of vanilla and honey that she hadn\u2019t changed, unlike her hair. He frowned. Maybe he could persuade her to change it back.</p><p>He heard a distinctive click, then another. Slicing his gaze to her, he found Daisy opening and closing the purse in her hands. She stared straight ahead, her brow wrinkled. The closer they got to the restaurant, the faster the purse clicked open and shut.</p><p>\u201cDaisy,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll stop. I know it\u2019s annoying, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not annoying me.\u201d Holding out his hand, he said, \u201cTake my hand.\u201d</p><p>She looked from his hand to his face, then back at his hand again. Her hazel gaze returned to his face, pretty eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, her fingers laced his and he pulled her hand to his mouth, brushing the knuckles with his lips. He let their joined hands settle in his lap and she scooted closer to him. The purse remained closed the rest of the way.</p><p>Dinner was exactly what Sebastian expected\u2014his closest mates joking and laughing, giving him an extraordinarily hard time about the engagement.</p><p>However, Daisy wasn\u2019t anything like he expected\u2014she remained by his side, quiet and thoughtful. Speaking only when spoken to and in almost a subservient manner, like everyone there was her better. Sure his mates consisted of aristocracy and business moguls, but they were a relaxed, down-to-earth group. He was the only outlier, but supposed every circle of friends had one.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked softly as the majority of their group ambled over to the bar. Only his closest mate, Liam, and Kate Von Lichtenstein remained. Sebastian really wasn\u2019t sure who\u2019d invited her.</p><p>Daisy\u2019s fork froze halfway to her mouth. \u201cFine. The food is delicious.\u201d Then she set her fork down on the side of her plate, her hand hovering for a minute before she placed it in her lap.</p><p>\u201cI thought the food was delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you eating?\u201d</p><p>Kate and Liam laughed at a picture on his cell phone, and then toasted one another. Really, what was she doing here and with Liam of all people? It didn\u2019t make sense. Besides, Liam was engaged, though his fianc\u00e9e was on a photo shoot in Spain or Italy at the moment, and completely faithful to the woman. And Kate wasn\u2019t one to go after men who were already taken.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at the pair.</p><p>A soft intake of breath. \u201cBecause...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, Liam, the ring is gorgeous. Bigger than your fianc\u00e9e, really. What did Verity\u2019s parents say when you two broke the news?\u201d Kate gushed in her usual way. \u201cI\u2019m dying to know.\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed. \u201cThey were pleased. And Verity said to remind you that you are the only woman allowed to accompany me about town while she\u2019s away.\u201d</p><p>Snatching Liam\u2019s phone, Kate grinned. \u201cLet me text your soon-to-be bride and assure her that I will keep a keen eye on her soon-to-be groom.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so Liam had invited her, with Verity\u2019s blessing. Sebastian relaxed. Now that made sense. He grinned at Kate. \u201cTell Verity you are keeping all the birds away from Liam, with your intimidating scowl.\u201d</p><p>Kate winked at Sebastian.</p><p>Sebastian winked back.</p><p>Daisy drew in a shuddering breath.</p><p>All through dinner, it seemed he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off Kate, the woman that had supposedly given her great fashion advice and wanted to be great friends.</p><p>Daisy pleated the napkin in her lap, and then moved on to her dress. An overwhelming urge to stand up and walk out came over her, but she remained firmly seated, even when Sebastian joined Liam and Kate.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s blond head bent close to Kate\u2019s dark one. They made a beautiful couple, so striking and fashionable...and English! While she sat there, like some poor cousin, all alone and feeling sorry for herself, in a dress that itched and hair that felt like it had been shellacked to her head. The sales clerk at the dress shop had recommended the hair salon.</p><p>If only Jules\u2014she struck that thought from her brain. Jules no longer existed. She would have to deal with that fact. He hadn\u2019t answered her last text, and thankfully, she\u2019d stopped herself from texting him thirty more times.</p><p>With that last thought, she excused herself and headed to the bathroom, intent on texting Isabella. Mercifully, it was mostly empty in the powder room. She sat in a plush chair and began to open her purse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere you are, Daisy,\u201d Kate said, sailing through the leather and gold studded door, all smiles, as if she hadn\u2019t been flirting with Sebastian. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to get a word with you.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s because you\u2019ve been too busy flirting with my fianc\u00e9, Daisy thought grimly. Not that she should care. She and Sebastian were pretend, no matter the very real feelings he\u2019d stirred inside of her when he\u2019d put\u2014okay, so those thoughts were off limits too.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Kate took the seat beside her. \u201cWhat did Sebastian think of tonight\u2019s ensemble?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said my hair looked pretty.\u201d His compliment had sounded strained, like he hadn\u2019t meant it.</p><p>Daisy glanced at Kate, at her perfectly coiffed hair and perfectly tailored outfit that looked nothing like the one she\u2019d picked out for Daisy. Kate was all High Street fashion while Daisy was evening strip-mall formalwear. Maybe the woman had tricked her and had been secretly making fun of her by dressing her in some overdone, itchy material meant for a woman three times her age.</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Kate frowned. \u201cThe outfit was perfect for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen maybe he should have worn it.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired woman laughed. \u201cWell, at least one outfit in your arsenal is guaranteed to stun him. I think you should wear the mint green Valentino to tomorrow evening\u2019s gala. It was in the slew of dresses I had sent over as an apology.\u201d</p><p>Daisy wouldn\u2019t touch anything in her \u201carsenal\u201d. Mint green Valentino or not. Sebastian\u2019s favorite color or not. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I done something dreadful?\u201d Kate\u2019s brows drew together and there was concern in her pale green eyes. Eyes that the Valentino dress matched perfectly. Eyes that matched Sebastian\u2019s favorite color perfectly.</p><p>Daisy\u2019s stomach dropped to her manicured toes. \u201cWho are you to Sebastian?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cMerely a family friend, like I told you,\u201d Kate insisted, but her gaze skittered away, like before.</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe grew up together, our fathers were business associates and... Daisy, I think you might get the wrong impression if I tell you the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in love with him,\u201d Daisy said, hoping against hope she was wrong. Hoping against hope that her memory hadn\u2019t just kicked in and she was imaging that she had seen pictures of Sebastian and Kate together, arm and arm.</p><p>Kate\u2019s porcelain complexion pinkened. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how I feel anymore, because he\u2019s in love with you now.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Sebastian wasn\u2019t in love with her at all, but she couldn\u2019t tell Kate that, could she? Daisy jumped to her feet, all at once embarrassed and angry. \u201cMaybe it would be better if we don\u2019t hang out anymore.\u201d Mostly because Daisy would feel like a fraud the entire time.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Kate cried out, standing and rushing over to her. \u201cI completely respect your boundaries and I\u2019ll stay away, but I want you to know...no, I need you to understand that I wanted to help you this evening and your entire stay, with your clothes and everything I could think of, because he does mean something to me. I enjoyed spending time with you as well, and I can see why he loves you.\u201d</p><p>Frozen to the spot, Daisy stared at the woman. Something along the lines of \u201cAh...uh...\u201d came from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cRight, then. Please treat him well. He works too hard. Make him have a little fun. He needs some fun in his life.\u201d Kate hugged her, and then left the room.</p> <p>She gazed around the ornate bathroom, at the burgundy walls infused with gold veins, and the large mirrors with ornate black frames. Her reflection stared back, eyes wide and face pale. She didn\u2019t recognize the woman in the mirror.</p><p>The vision wavered.</p><p>She wanted to go home.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>\u201cAre you mental?\u201d Liam asked, his dark eyes scanning the room.</p><p>Sebastian made a face. \u201cIt was your brilliant plan, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Daisy. She\u2019s lovely, beautiful, and charming.\u201d</p><p>Of course she was, Sebastian thought, but he wasn\u2019t too keen on his friend noticing. \u201cThen who?\u201d</p><p>His friend slashed a hand through the air. \u201cHer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer who?\u201d Sebastian signaled for the server to bring the check.</p><p>Liam set down his drink. \u201cKate, your ex-girlfriend. Did you honestly think it was a good idea to have the woman who wanted to marry you in the same room, dining at the same table, as the woman who is supposedly marrying you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on a minute, \u201cSebastian said, leaning forward. \u201cI thought you invited Kate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave you that impression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I give you that impression?\u201d</p><p>Good God, they were quickly becoming the X Factor\u2019s Ant and Dec. Sebastian took a deep breath and tried again. \u201cThe texts from Verity about Kate accompanying you around town.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Liam gave him a wry smile. \u201cAccording to Kate, your fianc\u00e9e invited her to dinner, with your expressed approval. They went shopping together this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck me.\u201d Practically leaping to his feet, Sebastian strode off in the direction Daisy had gone.</p><p>She met him halfway, her face pale. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he murmured, taking her by the arm. \u201cDid someone\u2014\u201d Jesus, he was a coward and an idiot for not warning her, for not blurting out the truth before now.\u2014\u201csay something to hurt your feelings?\u201d</p><p>A slight hesitation and his heart sank. \u201cNo. I\u2019m just tired, is all. Some of us aren\u2019t used to jetting around the world.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, he grinned. There was his Daisy. \u201cLet me pay the check and we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>The car ride to his home was as quiet as earlier in the evening, only this time tension invaded the space, thick and suffocating like a wet blanket.</p><p>It seemed as though she tolerated his presence, because as soon as they arrived and the doorman let them in, she\u2019d nearly ran to her bedroom. He had no idea what he\u2019d done wrong and no idea how to repair things.</p><p>Maybe he should wait until tomorrow to tell her about Jules.</p><p>After showering, he brushed his teeth and pulled on a pair of pajama pants. For a full ten minutes, he paced his room. There was no way he would wait until tomorrow to talk to her. Best to sort things out now.</p><p>He strode to the door and headed down the hall. Her room was only a few feet away. Light shone from her doorway. He knocked once and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cDaisy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She let out a squeal, clutching the dress she had worn to her chest, but that didn\u2019t obstruct his view of her bare bum or thighs or the dangerous curves of her waist. The mirror behind her had seen to that.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stepped in the room and shut the door behind him, never taking his eyes off her reflection. Then he noticed her hair and forgot why he\u2019d come to talk to her. A riot of curls in every shade imaginable fell to halfway down her back.</p><p>\u201cYour hair,\u201d he said, closing the distance between them and cupping her bare shoulders. Sliding his hands down her shoulders and around her back, he slipped his fingers in long strands. \u201cYou didn\u2019t cut it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of what I said about your wardrobe yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Her chin tipped up. \u201cMy hair isn\u2019t a part of my wardrobe.\u201d She looked away, her shoulders falling, and he suddenly realized how fatigued she must actually be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have bothered you,\u201d he said softly, letting hands fall away.</p><p>He stepped back, taking in her barely concealed body and the engagement ring on her finger. She was his. The very primal part of him wanted to dominate her, wanted to take her against the mirror, until she screamed his name. But the very civilized part of him won out and he pivoted, moving to the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask Kate to marry you, instead of this fake fianc\u00e9e stuff with me? It\u2019s obvious the two of you belong together.\u201d</p><p>That stopped him cold. He turned to face her again. The dress still clutched tight to her front. \u201cIf we belonged together, I would be with Kate, already married and not enduring this fake fianc\u00e9e stuff, as you so eloquently put it, with you,\u201d he snapped, then immediately regretted. He held up his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>Hazel eyes rimmed with lavender regarded him. \u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d</p><p>Hurt flared in her eyes. \u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>Taking a step towards her, he nodded. \u201cIf Kate and I belonged together, I would be with her and married. But we\u2019re not. Because we don\u2019t belong together.\u201d</p><p>Daisy stepped back, inching closer the mirror. \u201cShe still loves you.\u201d</p><p>Even as it came out of his mouth, he knew how bad it sounded, how vulnerable it made him, but it had to be said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t love Kate. I don\u2019t want to be with her and she knows this. I\u2019d rather be with you, my fianc\u00e9e, however fake. I\u2019d rather touch you, kiss you and be inside of you. I\u2019d rather listen to you hum and talk in your sleep.\u201d For the rest of his life.</p><p>Her lips parted, gaze raking over his chest. Yeah, she liked what she saw. Once more, he flicked his eyes over the mirror, taking in her nude reflection. And so did she. Her eyes darkened and his body responded, his dick growing hard. She was remembering what had happened between them, as did he.</p><p>He remembered every minute detail, down to the way her lashes flutter when she orgasmed.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you flirt with her and not me?\u201d she asked, her voice accusing.</p><p>Flirting? Now this was interesting. \u201cI wasn\u2019t flirting.\u201d</p><p>She nodded emphatically, sending those colorful curls he loved to touch flying. \u201cYes, you were. You laughed and smiled with her. And smiled...and was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI laughed and smiled with my mates as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Actually he hadn\u2019t a clue, until now. \u201cWere you jealous, darling?\u201d He smiled and her eyes went wide.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, but he didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u201cYou were.\u201d He closed the distance between them again, stopping a few inches shy of touching her. Heat radiated from her body, the dress she still clutched the only physical barrier between them. \u201cShall I smile and laugh with you, even when you\u2019re not speaking to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You looked beautiful tonight.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI was dressed like the Queen tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like vintage,\u201d he insisted, then gave her a wicked smile and raked his eyes over her. \u201cAu naturel is more to my taste.\u201d</p><p>She let go of the dress. It fell to the floor, landing on his bare feet. He made himself keep his eyes on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my shoes?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw them earlier.\u201d He dipped his head, brushing his lips across hers. She shivered, her hard nipples and soft breasts brushing against his chest as he embraced her.</p><p>\u201cI hate this,\u201d she whispered and he froze. She slid her arms around his back, stroking the lines of his tattoos. \u201cNot this, not you...it\u2019s...I can\u2019t sleep with you and not have it affect me.\u201d</p><p>At her confession, he kissed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m not that bloke, you know. The one they sometimes still show on the telly and the Internet\u2014a spoiled aristocrat sleeping around, partying like there\u2019s no tomorrow, punching out his father, and doing his level best to take down a corporate empire. I won\u2019t leave you for no reason.\u201d Like Jules had.</p><p>As if she were reading his thoughts, she asked, \u201cHow did you know about Jules\u2019s last name? You never answered me in the car. \u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to tell the truth, but the monster that lived inside spoke for him, \u201cI did a background check on you, your family, your friends\u2014virtual and real life\u2014before asking you to pose as my fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>Petal-pink lips made an O shape, and then a glimmer of anger shone in her eyes. Suddenly it faded. \u201cI guess that\u2019s reasonable, but I wished you would have told me sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know every humiliating thing about me.\u201d She sniffed, her hands falling to hang listlessly her sides. \u201cI must look like a total\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked strong to me. Determined. Unwilling to let anyone or anything keep you down.\u201d He cupped her shoulders, letting his hands slide her arms and encircle her wrists. \u201cTell me what to do to make this right. To make you comfortable and have this affect you in a way that makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, with so much emotion in her gaze that he wondered if he\u2019d done irreparable damage. Damn his selfish ass, tomorrow he would fly her back to Holland Springs, give her all of the money they\u2019d agreed to, and take the consequences like a real man.</p><p>\u201cTake me sightseeing.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. That was the last thing he expected her to say. \u201cSightseeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, all the places I missed, like the Harry Potter train ride... I want to do it all. With you,\u201d she said, a mischievous grin curving her lips. \u201cThen take me to a pub, so I can eat fish and chips and drink a pint of ale. Oh, and buy me a t-shirt, with the Union Jack on it.\u201d</p><p>A t-shirt? Oh, his giddy aunt. He swallowed. \u201cIs that all?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot by a long shot,\u201d she whispered against his lips as he released her wrists. \u201cI want to go to the house where they film Downton Abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly, you\u2019re fatigued and in desperate need of copious amounts of sleep,\u201d he said, before she could add to her list. Though her list charmed him, as did she.</p><p>She rubbed against him, her very hot body doing things to his that had him groaning and wrapping his arms around him. \u201cYou know when you\u2019re so tired that you can\u2019t go to sleep without some help?\u201d</p> <p>Right now he knew nothing, but the way she felt in his arms and beneath his palms. Satiny skin and a plump bum. He cupped her there, pressing her against his dick and creating a friction that set his teeth on edge. \u201cShall I be your sleep-aide, like the other night?\u201d</p><p>Her lips found his throat and kissed him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Sliding his hands from around her bum to her thighs, he lifted and carried her to the bed. He set her on the edge, letting his hands coast down her legs, to her feet, then he placed them on his shoulders. Like this, she was open and pink, completely vulnerable to his touch. Christ, he wanted her. And she wanted him.</p><p>But not yet.</p><p>\u201cYour shoes are fantastic,\u201d he said, peering up at her.</p> <p>She looked down at him, her cheeks flushing. \u201cTechnically they\u2019re your shoes, since the sales clerk suggested I open an account at Louboutin\u2019s, the one on Mount Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope you bought the lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have, with your preference for me to leave them on during sex,\u201d she said, wiggling her feet and smiling cheekily. She knew him so well. Her shoes sparkled with crystals. \u201cThese are the best shoes evah. Isabella will be so jealous.\u201d</p><p>He might have to buy the entire store, if those shoes made her that damned happy. Of course, they made him happy. High heels made every man happy, or they should in his opinion. \u201cWhat else did you buy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop talking, Sebastian, I\u2019ll make you take me to Stonehenge,\u201d she threatened.</p><p>Tilting his head to one side, he gave her a smug smile. \u201cPretty sure you\u2019re the one at my mercy, right now.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes glittered. She trailed a hand down her chest, lightly cupping her breast. She pinched a hard, pink nipple. He licked his lips and his erection became rock hard.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re at my mercy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMutual imprisonment? I think not.\u201d He leaned forward and wrapped his arms around her thighs, effectively pinning her to the spot. So very trusting, she was...and vulnerable. \u201cNot when I have you like this. Completely vulnerable to my mouth.\u201d He kissed her and her hips jerked. \u201cMy tongue.\u201d He traced a path to her clitoris and circled it, smiling when she smacked her palms on the bed and gasped his name</p><p>\u201cShall I tell you what to do with your hands?\u201d he said, and then softly blew hot air against her clit.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re holding me uh-up,\u201d she said, her voice rising.</p><p>He licked her again. \u201cFast learner, darling. Impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of sight-seeing,\u201d she panted, her breasts lightly bouncing.</p><p>Undeterred by her second warning, he continued his leisurely explorations. \u201cStratford-on-Avon is very popular,\u201d he said, and then sucked her clit into his mouth. She grabbed his hair, pulling and tugging as he ate her, as he feasted and gave her what she needed. Every lick, every nibble serving her. He served her, kneeling on the floor between her thighs and concentrating on bringing her to orgasm.</p> <p>\u201cBastian...ung...I\u2019m going...oh my,\u201d she said, her voice beautifully breathless.</p><p>Another graze of his teeth over her swollen flesh and she screamed, her fingers nearly ripping his hair out. He winced a little, but didn\u2019t stop. Instead, he watched her as she came apart, as her sexy body flushed and goose bumps dotted the landscape of her skin. Her lashes fluttered, eyes closing and luscious mouth parting.</p><p>When she finally subsided, he laid his cheek against her thigh. She unwound her fingers from his hair.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d she said, and then smiled sheepishly. \u201cMight need to tie me up from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He raised a brow, but that sexy woman didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>Sheepish gave way to seductress. \u201cMmm-hmm. I think I would like it.\u201d</p><p>Unhooking his arms from her legs, he stood and leaned in to her. \u201cYou\u2019d only like it?\u201d</p><p>She nipped at his jaw. \u201cI might love it if you do it\u2014one day. Need to ease into stuff like that.\u201d Flopping back on the bed, she scooted to the middle.</p><p>\u201cNaughty Daisy.\u201d His hard-on screamed for relief. But he didn\u2019t deserve to be inside of her, not tonight. Tonight was only about her. On second thought, if she wanted to have sex, he would have no choice but to concede to her demands.</p><p>He gazed down at her face. Sleepy eyes glowing with satisfaction blinked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a great sleep-aid, but further testing is needed to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I get other participants?\u201d he teased.</p><p>She pouted, full lips so kissable that he couldn\u2019t help himself. For long, torturous minutes, he kissed and stroked her body, while her hands explored his. He growled when she found his erection and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d He kissed the corner of her mouth, then worked his way to her ear and took the lobe between his teeth.</p><p>She arched her neck and turned her head. \u201cYou need sleep, too.\u201d</p><p>God, he was going to hate himself in the next few minutes. \u201cToday was a long day for me,\u201d he said, trying to ignore her hand that had moved from the outside of his pajama bottoms to the inside. She rubbed his piercing with her thumb and he bit his lip to keep from moaning.</p><p>\u201cNaughty Sebastian,\u201d she said, and then laughed a little. \u201cI want this inside of me.\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes. Then he remembered what he didn\u2019t come prepared for... Oh shit and kill him now.</p><p>\u201cBut not tonight. I\u2019m too sleepy,\u201d she said on a yawn, then gave him a little smile and let go of him, her hand falling to the bed. \u201cAnd satisfied.\u201d</p><p>Grimacing, he stood, painfully aroused. \u201cSee you in the morning,\u201d he said as she rolled on her side, and slipped off her heels. Desire hit him hard again, all those curves and bare skin so close, yet he didn\u2019t have permission to touch her. He crossed the room and opened her door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to wear your sightseeing suit,\u201d she called out.</p><p>He paused. \u201cI don\u2019t bloody have a sightseeing suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d She yawned again. \u201cWhatever you say, your suitliness.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, he shut the door behind him and padded to his room. He scrubbed his hand over his face and walked inside. He glanced down at his erection and exhaled. Guess he\u2019d have to take matters into his own hands.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cWake up, sleepyhead,\u201d Daisy sang, lightly tapping her very own Sleeping Beauty on the nose. \u201cDaylight\u2019s a-wasting.\u201d</p><p>Drowsy blue eyes blinked up at her. \u201cGood God, you\u2019re one of those people.\u201d He turned and buried his face in the pillow, giving her an unobstructed view of the tattoos she wanted to trace with her tongue.</p><p>Later, she reminded herself. First, she had to make him pay. Although what did it say about her that she had to blackmail him into spending time with her? Then again, no one had blackmailed him into giving her an orgasm that had made her see another universe full of stars that outshone the sun.</p><p>She smiled. Yep, she\u2019d lost her mind and then found it reading some poetry.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Sebastian. You promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked, his voice muffled.</p><p>Unable to stop herself, she traced the large R on his upper back with the tip of her finger and he growled. She laughed. \u201cSix AM. I let you sleep in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, woman, go back to bed,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>\u201cAre all world domination plotters this whiny in the morning? Need your cup of special world domination beverage to get you going first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it, Daisy.\u201d</p><p>Her smile grew wider as she traced another tattoo on his back. \u201cBless your heart. Maybe if I fed you first, you wouldn\u2019t be so ornery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I plan to be ornery all\u2014hang on,\u201d he said, turning over. His gaze landed on the nightstand. A tray loaded with plates of biscuits, grits, bacon, sausage, fruit, and muffins sat on it. \u201cDid you make all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had to pass the time somehow. I\u2019ve been up since three,\u201d she said, leaning over to grab the tray as he sat up. She placed it over his lap and smiled. \u201cHope you like it.\u201d</p><p>He dug in, then seemed to remember his manners and asked, \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI always eat while I cook. It\u2019s why I have to exercise every day. Else, I\u2019d end up looking like my Aunt Jeannie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI approve of your methods,\u201d he said around a mouthful of biscuit and ran an appreciative eye over her. He swallowed. \u201cAm I off cupcake rationing?\u201d</p><p>She had baked four dozen cupcakes this morning. \u201cDepends on you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his brows. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll make arrangements for this Saturday and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>One brow went higher than the other. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the earl\u2019s tour or even Sebastian Romanov\u2019s tour. I want the real deal tour, for tourists. In fact, I found a walking tour for us that we do at our own pace.\u201d She grabbed her phone from the nightstand and scrolled through it. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the infamous Wizard Tour this morning, right after you call in sick to work.\u201d</p><p>His chin dipped. \u201cYou\u2019re quite serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite pleased,\u201d she said, imitating his accent. And he looked less than pleased. He looked a little scared. \u201cIt won\u2019t be that bad mingling with the commoners, Your Lordship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the problem.\u201d He speared some helpless strawberries. \u201cI\u2019ve never called in sick to work, much less lied about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a first time for everything,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never lied before.\u201d She wriggled her fingers at him, engagement ring prominently displayed. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t say you\u2019re sick, then say I made you take me.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian burst out laughing. \u201cMade me?\u201d</p><p>Pouting, she batted her lashes at him. \u201cCall in sick for me?\u201d</p><p>He stopped laughing. \u201cPut those away,\u201d he ordered, pointing the fork at her lips.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She picked up the tray, grabbed his fork, and set all of it on the nightstand, then crawled into his lap and straddled him. \u201cIs this better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarginally,\u201d he said, but his hands settled on her hips.</p><p>She leaned forward, brushing her lips over his. \u201cBastian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>Another brush over his lips and she tugged the lower one into her mouth, sucking on it. Her heart sped up and her panties grew damp. This was a very dangerous game she was playing. Well, in that she might decide to spend the day with him in bed, instead of wandering the streets of London.</p><p>His hands tightened and he grew hard between her legs. She pressed against him, acutely aware of how empty she felt and how she wanted him to fill her. To stretch her and make it so she could feel him for days later. Her sex throbbed and pulsated with need, but she could be strong. She could make him wait.</p><p>\u201cTake. Me. Please,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Putty in her hands. \u201cGreat!\u201d She sat up, scrambled off the bed, and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll take the tray with me and finish cleaning up the mess I made in your kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Stunned didn\u2019t begin to describe the look on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave me, like this?\u201d Gesturing to his lap, his erection tenting the thin sheets.</p><p>Pretending not to notice his current state, she shook her head and grabbed the tray. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d He lunged at her.</p><p>She danced out of his reach, the plates sliding together with dull thuds. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to wait for you to get dressed first. Seriously, Sebastian, we\u2019d be mugged if you went outside looking like that.\u201d By horny women salivating over him.</p><p>\u201cAt least allow me to go by the office before we begin,\u201d\u2014snagging her phone from the bed, he read from the screen\u2014\u201cthis magical journey around London. Be sure to have your broom at the ready.\u201d He ran a hand down his face. \u201cWhy do you insist on torturing me?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cSpending time with me shouldn\u2019t be torture.\u201d Whirling around, she marched to the door. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not going to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking me mad so I won\u2019t want spend the day with you.\u201d She opened the door with her foot. \u201cI think you need to have some fun. Lots of it, for the entire time I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I need to have fun?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Casting a glance over her shoulder, she said, \u201cYes and Kate agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of you talked about me?\u201d His blue eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cNothing too personal,\u201d she fibbed.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say exactly?\u201d</p><p>Daisy swallowed. She had to tell him the truth. \u201cThat she still cared about you and it was the reason she was trying to help me fit in with your friends and dress the part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, his gaze assessing and maybe even hopeful.</p><p>Daisy\u2019s heart pinched. All that talk about him not loving Kate anymore, she realized, might be just that. Talk. \u201cYes. She thinks you work too much and need to have fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, she would know better than anyone.\u201d He jumped up from bed and strode to the bathroom. \u201cThe office first, then we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Daisy left his room, trudging along the hallway. She should be happy that he agreed. She should be happy that he was going to spend the day with her.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>Because all she could think about was the look on his face when he learned about Kate\u2019s concern for him. Worse than that, she didn\u2019t want to think about how much it hurt her heart to see it.</p><p>Sebastian ran a critical eye over Daisy as they waited for his driver. She wore one of her usual cardigans and a pair of dark jeans with hot pink flats that matched the chopsticks in her hair. Lovely, but not very practical for springtime English weather.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop staring at me?\u201d she asked, her brow wrinkling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not staring.\u201d She gave him a look. \u201cOkay, so I am\u2014er, was staring. I\u2019m actually concerned about how warm you\u2019ll be. Did you pack any jumpers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t worn one of those since I was eight,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you think I\u2019ll be too cold wearing jeans, then what in the world would make you think a dress could keep me warm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA jumper is a sweater,\u201d he said on a grin.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her face flushed. \u201cOoooh, so that\u2019s what Ron\u2019s mother made Harry. All this time I thought the woman had made him a dress for school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cForeign country, foreign-to-me customs. Plus, the book is fantasy. People can wear whatever they want in those.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and his fantasy would be to see her wearing nothing but the jewels that belonged to the future Countess of Spenserfield. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see the films? That explained what a jumper was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a purist. Usually when books become movies, they\u2014\u201d her eyes narrowed. \u201cHow would you know what was in the movies?\u201d</p> <p>Because his brother had been in the first two, as an extra, and he\u2019d always made a point to watch every film Christian had been in, no matter how small the roll. However, watching the rest of the films had been completely voluntary. \u201cI might be a fan.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cUh-huh. Bet you know lots of trivia and where everything was filmed around here, more than the website\u2019s tour.\u201d</p><p>Her bet would be correct. He grimaced. Time to change the subject. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done at the office we can pop down to High Street and find a coat for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean coat coat or coat as in a pot holder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA coat\u2019s a coat, Daisy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is.\u201d She winked at him, buoying his general outlook for the day.</p><p>He looked forward to spending time with her, all day, every day she was here. Time was fleeting, only two weeks here and then... He didn\u2019t know what exactly. Go back to Holland Springs with her or stay here, without her?</p><p>His phone vibrated in his pocket. Pulling it out, he glanced at it. Liam. Something had to be wrong. \u201cI need to take this. Do you mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo right ahead and bully all the world leaders you want, but can you start with the guy in North Korea, first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right on that,\u201d he said, answering the call and walking a few feet away. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems those pesky pictures of your brother and his night of revelry have resurfaced, this time with irrefutable proof it\u2019s him and not you,\u201d Liam said. \u201cSomeone posted the YouTube video of you speaking at Drayton\u2019s Charity event on the night in question.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch. Christian had finally made headway with his reputation, with everything he\u2019d worked so hard for, and had been forgiven by those who had accused him of remaining the cocked-up, playboy who only cared about himself. \u201cI\u2019ll have James issue another statement\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think the Board need be reminded of this incident?\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ, could his situation get any worse? No good deed ever went unpunished. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t, but hanging my brother out to dry isn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p><p>Liam let out a harsh breath. \u201cFigure out what\u2019s more important to you\u2014Romanov Industries or your family.\u201d</p><p>His family? \u201cWhich side\u2014my mother\u2019s, who loathes my very sight, or my father\u2019s, who given the choice between murdering me or inviting me to dinner, would choose blowing my fucking head off every time?\u201d All because he\u2019d cut ties with them. Bloody Russian Mafia.</p><p>\u201cYour call, mate,\u201d Liam said calmly. He hadn\u2019t become Vice President of Romanov Industries by staying in the dark, no matter how embarrassing it was for Sebastian\u2019s best mate to learn all his family\u2019s dark sins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d He ended their call, jaw clenching. There was nothing he\u2019d like more to do than smash his damn phone against the wall, or go a few rounds with Ivan.</p><p>\u201cYour driver\u2019s here, Sebastian,\u201d Daisy said, placing a hand on his arm. Concern was plainly written on her face. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to disappear again, to hide out in a place no one would ever accuse him of going. But he couldn\u2019t. He had his brother to look out for, a sister-in-law, and his damnable cousin, Alexander.</p><p>And now he had Daisy to protect, for the rest of her life. She\u2019d never know, of course, but he would do it. Perhaps he should have explained that bit of his family\u2019s business dealings to her. Briefly, he closed his eyes and slid the phone back into his pocket. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go sightseeing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll go by myself, or take Ivan the Terrible with me.\u201d</p><p>Trust her to lighten his mood, no matter what. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t call him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s his pro-wrestling name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormer pro-wrestling name.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cHe still wrestles on his days off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget about the driver, darling.\u201d Her face fell and he caressed her cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re walking.\u201d</p><p>Her enchanting smile returned as he grabbed an umbrella and her hand. \u201cYay! Does this mean you\u2019re open to wearing matching Union Jack t-shirts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He opened the door, gesturing for her to go first. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even think about pouting or batting your lashes at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatching hats?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Good God. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sidelong glance. \u201cMatching jumpers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your sense of adventure?\u201d</p><p>They stepped out onto the street and he breathed deeply, then checked behind him. Boris and Ivan followed at a discreet distance. \u201cWith my sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like I got my work cut out, then.\u201d She tugged on his hand. \u201cHurry up, I want to hear the song about the lemons at the church.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, right in the middle of the sidewalk, and took her in his arms. \u201cDaisy, there\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I agreed to a half day.\u201d She tilted her head to one side, her brows drawing together. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t call in sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not calling in at all.\u201d He dipped his head, kissing her softly. Looking into her hazel eyes, he said, \u201cToday...my time belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a nice English saying,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an\u2014\u201d He clamped his jaw shut before he could finish his sentence. He\u2019d nearly mucked up their day. Tell her, the very standup part of him said. Later, the monster inside of him roared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very lovely saying,\u201d he agreed as they linked arms.</p><p>Daisy gazed wide-eyed and a little terrified at the London Eye. She wanted to experience everything of London, but that Ferris wheel made her knees shake.</p><p>\u201cLast stop,\u201d Sebastian said, sliding his phone in his pocket.</p><p>She opened her mouth to tell him that she really, really didn\u2019t want to go on The Eye, but he stopped her with an engaging smile and hands held up in surrender.</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t want the earl\u2019s tour of London or even the Sebastian Romanov\u2019s tour, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I\u2019ve arranged a private capsule for us to have Afternoon Tea. They had one for couples in love, but I thought it a bit much,\u201d he said, looking so pleased with himself she didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him no. He held out his hand. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Lacing her fingers through his, she smiled and then began to pray\u2014silently\u2014for courage and not to pass out. \u201cHow long is the ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Her vision swam as they bypassed a line of tourist waiting in line for tickets. She almost stumbled. \u201cThat long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems rather short to me.\u201d</p><p>It would seem like a million years to her. Heights terrified her. Planes were necessary evils and only by taking something before she got on, so she could fall asleep, helped her not panic.</p><p>They entered the capsule and a spread fit for the Queen\u2019s Afternoon Tea greeted them. In the middle of the room, a long table was covered with a white cloth. Plates of sandwiches, desserts, and a delicate tea service sat on top of that and in the center was a huge bouquet of flowers. All her favorites.</p><p>She should enjoy this. She wanted to enjoy this. Come hell or high altitudes, she would enjoy this.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Boris and Ivan? Don\u2019t they want some tea and crumpets? Or is vodka and caviar more their thing?\u201d she asked, trying to joke around. \u201cIs there vodka for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had entertained the thought of Champagne, but thought you\u2019d like this more. In any case, Boris is in the capsule behind us and Ivan is in the one in front of us.\u201d Sebastian wiggled his brows. \u201cIt\u2019s only the two of us. I declined being attended by servers or a host.\u201d</p><p>Oh goody. He\u2019d be the only one to see her lose her ever-loving mind.</p><p>The door closed behind them. Her heart sped up. She wanted to drop to the floor and crawl to the nearest chair. She turned to face the stunning view of the city.</p><p>Sebastian joined her. \u201cJust wait until we get to the top.\u201d</p><p>The Ferris wheel began to move. \u201cOh God,\u201d she croaked, her arm shooting out to find the wall...something to keep her upright. Finding nothing, she sort of half-crumpled, half-slid to the floor and pressed her fingertips to her eyes, breathing deeply.</p><p>\u201cDaisy.\u201d She felt Sebastian sit beside her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said on a sniff and looked up at him. Compassion on his face. \u201cI\u2019m scared of heights, but I didn\u2019t want to ruin your surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me anyway.\u201d He stroked her hair, taking out the chopsticks and placing them on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m not too fond of confined spaces, really. This capsule was pushing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not? It is?\u201d She searched his face. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Soft compassion melted away, leaving nothing behind. His pale eyes were hard and his mouth drawn tight. For long minutes, he said nothing, then, \u201cMy father\u2019s favorite punishment was to lock me in a cupboard under the servants\u2019 stairs for hours at a time.\u201d</p><p>Bile rose in her throat. Locked him up, for hours at a time? \u201cFavorite?\u201d She didn\u2019t want to know this. She didn\u2019t have a right to know this.</p><p>\u201cAchieving perfection comes at a high price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as perfection, not really.\u201d Reasonable people knew this. His father should have known this. His father should have been put in jail.</p><p>\u201cThe punishment must fit the crime, or in my case, receiving a B instead of an A. Or playing a joke on him. Vladimir was a remarkably inventive man when it came to punishments,\u201d he continued, as if he hadn\u2019t heard her. More likely, he didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cAnd God help you if you showed the slightest hint of weakness when it was meted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian had it much worse.\u201d</p><p>Worse? \u201cOh, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter our mother left us, Vladimir ignored him. It was as though Christian didn\u2019t exist. Given the choice, I\u2019d think he would have picked the cupboard, because in some fucked-up way, it meant Vladimir actually cared.\u201d He was matter-of-fact while saying this, like he was relaying the evening news to her.</p><p>Tears pricked at her eyes and gathered in her throat. She slowly reached out to touch his face, the rough stubble of his five o\u2019clock shadow tickling the tips of her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he hurt you and your brother. His job was to protect. People with power should always choose to protect the ones without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing like my father,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me,\u201d she insisted, turning his face to hers. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the most compassionate people I know.\u201d Tears escaped, slipping down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Daisy.\u201d He wiped away her tears with the pad of his thumb. \u201cIt\u2019s in the past.\u201d</p><p>She tried to take a deep breath, but it ended up being shallow and shaky. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right.\u201d He leaned into her touch, his eyes closing. \u201cVladimir fucked me up good, huh?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say to that. Instead, she sat there with him, never taking her eyes off his face as she caressed him. Finally his eyes opened, blue eyes glittering with an emotion she couldn\u2019t define. Or maybe she was too scared to name.</p><p>He smiled tightly, and then kissed her forehead. \u201cYou did it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid what?\u201d she asked as he gently grabbed her wrist and pulled them both to their feet.</p><p>He tipped his head toward the glass. \u201cMade it to the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did? Oh my God, I did!\u201d Refusing to look at the view, she threw herself against him and hugged him tight, mostly because she still hadn\u2019t gotten over her fear of heights.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not letting go of me for the entirety of the ride, are you?\u201d he asked, amusement lacing his words.</p><p>She shook her head, his wool sweater prickly against her cheek. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>After her last sightseeing tour stop fail, Daisy had insisted Sebastian to take her to a local pub. He, of course, wanted to go home. But she couldn\u2019t trust herself to go home with him, not without sleeping with him, and her desire for Sebastian was getting worse by the second.</p><p>The way he\u2019d helped her in their private capsule hadn\u2019t helped at all. Neither had his confession of some of his most secret fears. Or when he\u2019d held her the entire time while they rode The Eye and didn\u2019t take Afternoon Tea. She still felt guilty about wasting all that food and his money.</p> <p>The cab they shared bumped down a narrow road. \u201cHow far away is this pub?\u201d</p><p>Another bump and he slammed into her. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sense of adventure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to eat another one of my cupcakes ever again, do you?\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand on her thigh and leaned closer, his sweater-covered chest brushing against her breasts. \u201cI could eat your cupcakes for hours, for days on end, and always come back for more.\u201d</p><p>Oh my mercy. Heat pooled low in her belly and she managed a weak laugh. \u201cSweet talking me won\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>He wriggled his brows and grinned. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t hurt things either.\u201d</p> <p>The cab stopped, saving her from answering as Sebastian got out to pay the driver. Why he didn\u2019t pay the man while they were in the car made no sense to her, but who was she to judge? She stepped out of the cab and made her way to the entrance of the\u2014oh Dear Lord\u2014she gaped at the name. \u201cThe Cock and Beaver?\u201d The rooster painted on the wooden sign was practically straddling the poor beaver. \u201cHe wants me to order food from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite place,\u201d Sebastian said from behind her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to tell anyone I ate here.\u201d She busted out laughing, tears forming in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTranslations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe speak the same language.\u201d He opened the door for her and held it. \u201cA cock\u2019s a cock and a beaver\u2019s a beaver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my mercy,\u201d she giggled, then dug her phone out of her purse and took of picture of the sign, sending a text to Isabella and Haven. Hopefully, Haven would have cell service soon. She would love this. \u201cWhen in Rome, I\u2019ll eat at the Cock and Beaver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Daisy, I don\u2019t understand why the name is so amusing.\u201d</p> <p>She bit back another smile. \u201cI\u2019ll explain it to you when you\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>The pub wasn\u2019t too crowded and it fulfilled the hyped-up vision she\u2019d had of an English pub. Low ceilings stained with smoke from a huge fireplace, exposed wooded beams and an ancient bar. There was a dartboard off to the side, with a chalk scoreboard. A couple played at the moment, drinking beer and giving each other kisses after each throw.</p><p>\u201cShall I order, while you find a table or would you rather sit at the bar?\u201d</p><p>She pointed to an empty table in a shadowy corner of the bar. \u201cI want to people watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s her day,\u201d she heard him mutter.</p><p>After practically running over to the table, she sat in a chair that faced the room and pulled one up for Sebastian beside her.</p><p>\u201cTwo pints\u2014one for the lovely countess,\u201d the server said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat countess?\u201d More honest-to-goodness titled people? \u201cWhat does she look like?\u201d She searched the room, thinking she\u2019d see a woman wearing a crown and a ball gown, as one did in a bar in the middle of nowhere, but the only person who stuck out was Ivan, wearing a grim expression as he surveyed the room.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should hold off on ordering another one until you\u2019ve eaten something.\u201d Setting the drinks down, the server gave her a this-woman-is-clearly-already-drunk look. \u201cSebastian said to tell you he had to take a call and would return in a bit. Fish and chips should be right up.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the server meant her. Daisy grinned sheepishly, her shoulders rising. \u201cThanks. Can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>Before Daisy could further make a fool of herself, Sebastian appeared and sat down beside her. \u201cDoes my pub meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in you own it or this is my most favorite place ever and I like to come here all of the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe latter.\u201d</p><p>She took a drink of her ale as their food arrived. \u201cCouldn\u2019t say it, could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to invite Boris and Ivan to join us?\u201d The two had been following them all day, mostly at a discreet distance, but she wasn\u2019t dumb. Sebastian lived a life that required security. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be too weird not to have large men with guns following her around when she and Sebastian went their separate ways.</p><p>Her heart pinched. She didn\u2019t want to think about separate ways.</p><p>\u201cNo drinking on the job.\u201d He toasted her, smiling so bright that she couldn\u2019t see anything but him. \u201cTo more days like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen more at least,\u201d she said, lightly hitting her glass against his. She had to be wary of that smile, of his actions\u2014like surprising her with a hat, a jumper, and a t-shirt with the Union Jack on it. \u201cThen it\u2019s back home for me,\u201d she reminded him, really herself. This was not permanent.</p><p>\u201cRight. Can\u2019t forget that.\u201d He looked off into the distance, his smile disappearing into his drink.</p><p>With a heavy heart, she dug into her food, eating fish and fries that tasted so good she wanted two more orders of it. Sebastian ate his as well, but kept quiet.</p><p>On her second glass of ale, music began to play and a woman picked up a microphone, singing along. A nearby television displayed the words and highlighted them.</p><p>She halfway rose out of her chair. \u201cDo you ever Karaoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She sat back down again. \u201cOh.\u201d Something on his sweater glittered and she peered closer. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing the flag pin I got you.\u201d</p><p>He flushed. \u201cGuilty.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled her eyebrows. \u201cWe match, like a real couple and everything.\u201d Her heart soared and a smile curved the corners of her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite pissed, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWhy would I be mad at you for wearing my pin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissed means drunk, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...You really are sweet,\u201d she sighed. \u201cAnd nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sweet or nice.\u201d His voice lowered. \u201cAnd if you weren\u2019t drunk, I\u2019d take you home and shag you senseless to prove it.\u201d</p><p>Blood pounded in her ears. Desire unfurled, winding through her body and making itself at home. She throbbed. She ached. She wanted him. Her nipples grew hard, her breasts heavy and sensitive against her lace bra. \u201cI\u2019m not drunk, Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>He leaned into her, nibbling on her neck. \u201cI\u2019m not too sure about that.\u201d His large hand covered her breast, gently squeezing.</p><p>Shutting her eyes, she moaned. His fingers slipped up and under her sweater, finding her nipple with ease. He tweaked the hard nub and her breath hitched. \u201cSomeone might see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo dark.\u201d He pinched her nipple again, sending sparks of pleasure right to where she throbbed and pulsated for him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she panted. Although she wasn\u2019t sure if it was a plea for more or for him to stop.</p><p>His palm ground against her clit and she wished she didn\u2019t have on jean or panties. \u201cI have a place nearby.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered, and he covered her mouth with his, tongue tasting and exploring. She grabbed his bicep and thigh, letting that hand go up to where he was hard for her. \u201cHow far away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Jumping to her feet, she grabbed her purse and phone. \u201cPay the bill and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They made it in twelve minutes.</p><p>She kissed him as he unlocked the door, as they tried to run up the stairs and into his bedroom. Finally, Sebastian grabbed her by her thighs and lifted her up, lurching down the hall. Muscle memory his guide.</p><p>He flipped on the lights, slammed the door shut, and set her on her feet. She kissed him again, plunging her tongue in his mouth until he moaned.</p><p>Sebastian ripped her sweater open, buttons popping and pinging as they hit priceless artwork and vases. He kissed his way down her neck, to her chest, and took the tip of a lace-covered breast into his mouth. She moaned his name, her hands going to the edge of his sweater and tugging.</p><p>\u201cI want this off,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d He stopped kissing her long enough to get their clothes out of the way. Then he cupped her face and kissed her deeply.</p><p>She brought his face down to hers, with one hand on the back of his neck. \u201cI want you,\u201d she said, biting his lip.</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d he growled, shoving his hand between her thighs. She was hot, wet, and swollen. He eased a finger inside of her, then another. \u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes..ung...yes.\u201d Moaning, she moved against him, hard nipples scraping his chest and hips rolling. In her next breath, he\u2019d grabbed a condom from his pants pocket and dropped to the floor, pulling her on top of him. \u201cRide me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in this position before,\u201d she whispered and he tore open the foil of the condom and rolled it on.</p><p>Glen was an idiot. He should be shot, castrated, and hung out to dry, and Sebastian was more than happy to do all three to the man. Determined not to let his shock or inner thoughts at her confession show, he leaned up to kiss her. \u201cRise up on your knees, darling.\u201d</p><p>Biting her lip, she did as he instructed. He grabbed the base of his dick. \u201cNow sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d The tip of him went inside her, where she was hot, tight, and wet.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Encouraged, she took all of him, bottoming out on his groin. He grabbed her hips, helping her move. Faster and faster, he urged her to ride him. Damn, but she was a quick learner.</p><p>\u201cI needed this,\u201d he said on a groan. \u201cI needed to be inside of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she whispered. Leaning forward, she balanced her hands on his chest and rode him hard. Breasts bouncing, nipples tight points, and hair falling out of its bun.</p><p>\u201cThere...like that.\u201d Grabbing a thick lock, he wrapped it around his wrist and tugged her forward, grinding his body against hers. She came, blindingly fast and screaming his name.</p><p>Another desperate thrust into her tight, hot flesh, and he joined her. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he muttered as she stopped moving upon him. Her chest heaved and his rose in time as well. He swiped a hand over his face, opened his eyes, and smiled up at her. \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think woman-on-top is a new favorite of mine.\u201d</p><p>He wondered what else she hadn\u2019t tried, and made a mental note to ask her that later. \u201cShall we adjourn to the bed?\u201d</p><p>Giggling, she fell against him, her face fitting perfectly in the crook of his neck. \u201cI vote aye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ayes have it.\u201d Somehow, he managed to get them both to their feet, make use of the loo, and return to find her lying on her back in the middle of his bed, black lashes resting against her cheeks. She was right where she belonged.</p><p>The mattress dipped a little under his weight as he joined her.</p><p>\u201cI like your house,\u201d she said, eyes opening. \u201cWell, what I saw of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll give you the grand tour tomorrow. How would you like to live here for the rest of your visit?\u201d</p><p>She raised her head, resting it in the palm of her hand. \u201cWhat about work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTelecommuting is better for the environment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter for you, too,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what about all the parties and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cParties are overrated and the paparazzi can find us anywhere. So goals will still be met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...good.\u201d She blinked up at him, a little frown forming on her full lips.</p><p>\u201cIt is. I think you\u2019ll like it better here. More freedom to pop down to wherever you like.\u201d</p><p>Her gorgeous smile returned, bright enough to rival the sun. \u201cThank you for thinking of me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNear Surrey, in a village called Cheam.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she didn\u2019t say a word. That\u2019s right, darling, put it all together. \u201cYou\u2019d rather have a vacation here than anywhere else in the world?\u201d</p><p>Here was home, the place he\u2019d bought with her in mind, in order to make happy memories. And now she was here, lounging in his bed. Cheeks flushed and eyes sparkling as if it were their wedding night. As if they were in love. Oh, how he loved her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but if you don\u2019t want to stay\u2014\u201d</p><p>She placed a finger over his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her finger and she drew it away. \u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll explore the village, the park, and take you to The Mansion. Heard they filmed an episode of Downton there last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so sweet!\u201d She gave him a quick kiss and started to rise from the bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep right now. You should, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laughing, he caught her by the waist and pulled the sheets over their heads. \u201cI think you\u2019re more excited about that, than spending time with me.\u201d</p><p>Light from the chandelier filtered through the white sheets, casting her in a hazy glow as she lay down beside him.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s changed between us,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>He slid his hand up and down her arm. \u201cFor the good, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, too,\u201d she said, burying her face into his neck. \u201cOr we made a really big mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlen royally screwed you over, yeah?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her lips on his throat. \u201cJules hurt me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you let me make it up to you?\u201d</p> <p>A thick sigh left her, and her soft body seemed to melt into his. \u201cHow about we forget Jules and Glen ever happened to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish,\u201d he said, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>She lifted her head, looking down on him. \u201cYou know so much about me, but I hardly know anything about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened to Kate.\u201d</p><p>He should have known she\u2019d want to know about his former relationship with Kate. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to know the answer to that,\u201d he said slowly.</p> <p>\u201cTell me anyway.\u201d</p><p>So tenacious. One of the things he admired about her. \u201cBusiness came first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she left you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I broke things off with her.\u201d He still remembered their talk, her face, and the relief he\u2019d felt. Then the guilt that had followed for being relieved. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t her fault I couldn\u2019t change my ways.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cYou mean wouldn\u2019t change your ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld habits are hard to break, but I guess if I had really loved her, then I would have freed myself from them,\u201d he said, increasingly uncomfortable with the direction of their conversation. He knew his shortcomings. He knew he was an almost exact replica of Vladimir Romanov, not in temperament perhaps, but in nearly everything else that counted for something.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou think love makes someone change? You can\u2019t change for someone else, not permanently anyway. Those habits will creep right back up and bite you in the arse.\u201d She grinned for a moment, and then her expression turned serious. \u201cEither change, because you want to change, or don\u2019t bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t change anything about you,\u201d she added in a heated whisper, her words a warm caress of air upon his skin. \u201cYou\u2019re real and honest, and say exactly what you mean.\u201d</p> <p>Stunned, his hands froze on her back. The people closest to him always wanted something different from him. For him to be someone he wasn\u2019t, someone more to their liking and his feelings be damned, not that he hadn\u2019t earned their disappointment on some level.</p><p>Soon she would join them, when he finally confessed the truth, but not tonight. Maybe not even tomorrow, or the next day.</p><p>\u201cWell, there is one thing I\u2019d change about you,\u201d she said.</p><p>His heart sank. \u201cDo enlighten me,\u201d he said, keeping the disappointment out of his voice.</p><p>She threw the covers off them and straddled his lap. All wicked curves, sexy breasts, and delicious pink nipples. The curls of her sex were damp against his skin. \u201cYour favorite pub.\u201d</p><p>A bark of laughter escaped him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the Cock and Beaver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? It\u2019s two substitution words for very naughty parts of the anatomy. I mean, every time I said the name, I expected someone to yell, \u2018That\u2019s what she said.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>A fine blush covered her face, travelling lower over her chest. \u201cWell, cock is a cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rooster?\u201d he asked, knowing full well what she meant. \u201cWhat\u2019s so naughty about a barnyard animal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Rolling her eyes, she shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a cock cock.\u201d</p><p>He had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. \u201cAh, then touch that very naughty part of my anatomy.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her thighs, her hand slipped down and gently grabbed his dick. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Briefly he closed his eyes as he grew hard again, and then peered at her through his lashes. \u201cSo that\u2019s a cock? Who knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d She punched him in the chest and he made an unf sound. \u201cYou knew the entire time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an excellent guesser.\u201d The tip of her thumb rubbed his piercing and he groaned low in his throat. \u201cWhat about the beaver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, it\u2019s, well, you know,\u201d she said, that blush of hers becoming redder by the second.</p><p>He rose up on his elbows, very aware that she had begun to stroke his cock. His hips lifted to meet each down stroke. \u201cIf you can\u2019t use your words, darling, then use your hand. Your less occupied hand.\u201d</p><p>Her head turned to the side as her hand inched toward where he wanted to be again. \u201cI can\u2019t. I know I should be able to, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d He cupped the side of her face. \u201cLook at me. Between us, everything is shameless.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, lips brushing his palm. \u201cWhy would anyone want to change a man who says things like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you do to me.\u201d He pulled her down to him, finding her mouth easily. It opened eagerly under his, their tongues slipping and sliding against the other, as if she couldn\u2019t get enough of him. She kissed him endlessly, taking his breath and making it her own. Taking his heart, his soul...his everything.</p><p>All of him belonged only to her. Forever.</p><p>Rolling her under him, he drove himself inside of her and she gasped his name. The initial clasp of her inner muscles as she tried to accommodate his size was nearly his undoing. She was so damned hot, tight, and wet he couldn\u2019t speak. Couldn\u2019t tell her how bloody good she felt. How perfect she was in his arms. How he was falling in love with her even more.</p><p>It should have scared the hell out of him.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t. It spurred him on, the sound of her sexy moans filling his ears. Her hands gripping him to her, fusing their bodies and sending him closer to the edge.</p><p>Daisy wrapped her legs around his lean hips. She couldn\u2019t get past the sensation of Sebastian inside of her, thick, long, and pierced. She couldn\u2019t get past the sensation that it felt like nothing was between them. Flames of desire licked at every nerve ending, burning her. Sebastian\u2019s hips rolled, the muscles of his back gathering and flexing under her palms.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she moaned. Her back arched, and he was there, tongue licking a hot path up her throat.</p><p>\u201cChrist...I\u2019ve never felt anything so good.\u201d He drove into her hard, unrelenting, as he laced their fingers together. Stretching her arms above her head, he moved in firm, hard strokes. Not sex, not making love...more than that, and yet all of that.</p><p>She shivered, desire and unadulterated lust twining.</p><p>Suddenly, he pulled out of her, kneeled between her legs and gave her sex a long, luscious lick, his tongue firm against her sensitized clit. \u201cI could eat you for hours,\u201d he murmured and she flushed hot. \u201cMake you come on my tongue and my fingers, over and over until you couldn\u2019t take it. Then I\u2019d thrust inside of you, make you come on my cock. I\u2019d come inside you, yeah? Fill you up, until it ran down your thighs. You\u2019d be mine. \u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head to the side, mouth thinning like he wanted to argue. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d belong to me... and I\u2019d belong to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll yours.\u201d His handsome face turned harsh, his eyes glittering as he crawled up her body. \u201cAll mine.\u201d</p><p>Large hands parted her thighs and he thrust deep, jolting her. He set a hard pace, one that she strained to keep up with, until he cupped her bottom and lifted her to meet him. She flung her arms out, hands searching for purchase and finding the headboard. Her fingers curved around the largest of the spindles.</p><p>Rain poured, hitting the windowpanes. Thunder rumbled. Elements outside mirroring their lovemaking.</p><p>For long moments he kept her on knife\u2019s edge, her orgasm at his fingertips. Their bodies became slick, their breathing harsh, and kisses sweetly fierce. His thumb passed over her clit, a sweeping caress that made her hips jerk and her nipples tighten to hard, needy points.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>Another caress, and then firm, circular motions that made stars spark behind her closed lids. \u201cYes.\u201d He thrust deep and her eyes opened. \u201cUng...More.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever my lady wants,\u201d he murmured, and then did something with his fingers that made her sob his name. So close. She was so close that she wanted to scream.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, desperate for this sweet torture to end. Desperate for her climax that only he could give her. He was ruining her. Ruining her for any man that wasn\u2019t him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He ground his palm against her and her body bucked, pleasure tearing through her and carving out a path that only Sebastian could ever travel.</p><p>It was too much.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>A low growl left him. His fingers dug painfully into her left hip as he surged deep, emptying himself inside of her as her sex clenched around him. His sky blue eyes widened as her name seemed to be ripped from his throat.</p><p>He slumped over her, keeping most of his weight on his arms and off her. She pressed kisses to his face and throat, lightly tracing the tattoos on his shoulders with the tips of her fingers.</p><p>His head lifted and he smiled at her, blond hair all mussed just the way she liked it. \u201cAbout work tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose and drew her brows together. After that, he was thinking of work? \u201cWhat about it?\u201d she asked warily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a holiday,\u201d he said and kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cFor a fortnight at least. You can extend your holiday here for a few extra days, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortnight? Translation, please.\u201d</p><p>That sexy smile of his widened. \u201cMy little American. Two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my earl of the enormous cock.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNow that\u2019s better than all the other ignoble titles you\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like all the titles I\u2019ve given you. No one else dares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaring women are very sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are the men who dare to be with those daring women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite. In any event...Was I too rough?\u201d The concern lacing his voice made her heart flip. There he went being all protective on her.</p><p>\u201cYou were perfect.\u201d She\u2019d be sore as all get out in a couple of hours.</p><p>He pulled out of her, rolling to the side and propping his head up with his hand. \u201cThere is a guest room, but I\u2019d rather you sleep with me. The choice, however, is yours.\u201d</p><p>Shifting to hug him, she winced and froze in place as evidence of what they\u2019d done slipped down her inner thighs. \u201cSebastian?\u201d Her voice sounded odd to her ears.</p><p>He smiled at her, running his free hand down her side. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe forgot to use protection.\u201d She gulped and his smile fell. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry about getting anything from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfectly safe with me,\u201d he said, but it didn\u2019t make her feel that much better at all. \u201cWhy do you still look so upset? Crisis averted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on the pill,\u201d she whispered, feeling about as smart as a stump.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Sebastian couldn\u2019t speak for a moment. He\u2019d never done anything so spectacularly stupid in his life.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d came his brilliant answer. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, her face pale. \u201cI stopped taking birth control pills when I was twenty, after I was hospitalized with several blood clots in my legs. I\u2019d been having severe pain in them for days, like I could barely walk, and my ankles were swollen twice their normal size.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor diagnosed me with Venous Thromboembolism. It\u2019s a rare\u2014yay me\u2014side effect of the pill. Glen and I weren\u2019t willing to risk a blood clot forming in my heart or lungs, or brain. We used condoms from then on,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d he asked. The room spun and he blinked. Dear God, he felt dizzy. \u201cI can take you to a clinic and get the morning after pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She visibly swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s a concentrated dose of what\u2019s in birth control pills. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about later...once you found out?\u201d He told himself he would support her decision, whatever it may be, but he\u2019d never been faced with this before, so...who really knew how\u2019d he react?</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t choose to have an abortion, Sebastian.\u201d She gave him a tentative smile, but it didn\u2019t reach her pretty eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s... okay if you don\u2019t want to be a dad. My momma raised me without one, so I\u2019d be fine...I think.\u201d</p><p>That little I think was telling. Daisy no more wanted to raise a child alone than any other woman did, given the choice. And by God he would give her the choice of having him in their lives, should it come to that.</p><p>He cupped the side of her face. \u201cIf you are, then I\u2019d want to be involved. I\u2019d be there for the two of you. You wouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>The tears came then, hard and ugly. This was the last thing she needed. He knew that. She\u2019d been under so much stress and pressure from trying to do it all that she\u2019d finally reached her breaking point.</p><p>She curled into a little ball, crying harder, until he simply gathered her up in his arms and walked to the bathroom. He turned on the hot water in the shower and stepped inside, sinking to the floor and holding her until she stopped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get through this.\u201d Tightening his arms around her, he exhaled. \u201cTogether.</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d she sniffed.</p><p>\u201cI swear it.\u201d</p> <p>She relaxed in his arms, his words calming her more than the heat and steam ever could. He only hoped he could live up to her expectations.</p><p>Daisy was late.</p><p>She placed her hand over her stomach, and then smoothed the material of her long-sleeved shirt down. Then she did it again. And again.</p><p>Sebastian hadn\u2019t touched her sexually in days, but she wasn\u2019t so sure that was a bad thing. In the meantime, he\u2019d taken her everywhere, showing her the sights and keeping her going non-stop until she\u2019d pass out his bed when they would finally get home.</p><p>She knew, like her, he was waiting for when she could take a pregnancy test. Even though she was as regular as rain, she\u2019d given herself a week to account for stress.</p> <p>Today was day eight.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want people speculating on why you\u2019re doing that, then you might want to stop,\u201d Sebastian murmured, his head dipping as he smiled.</p><p>They stood in the family planning aisle of the drugstore. Condoms, lube, and every other contraceptive device known to man and woman were on the same aisle as pregnancy tests and ovulations kits.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think when we buy\u2014\u201d she jerked her head in the direction of the pregnancy tests, \u201c\u2014people will figure it out on their own?</p><p>His lips flattened for a brief moment. \u201cTrue, but it doesn\u2019t mean we have to help them along.\u201d</p><p>Edging closer to him, she chewed on the inside of her cheek. \u201cHow long would you want this to be a secret?\u201d</p> <p>Frosty blue eyes met hers. \u201cFor as long as possible.\u201d</p><p>Her blood turned to ice and her hand shook as she reached for the first brand she recognized. \u201cI thought...you promised you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>His big hand fit over hers and squeezed lightly. The ice in her veins thawed. Slowly, like a glacier melting in the spring. \u201cDespite our rather public engagement, I value my privacy, and I\u2019d rather you not be stressed by the extra attention you\u2019d received if...you needn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cThat you are...um...?\u201d</p><p>Good grief. Neither of them could actually say the word pregnant. Maybe neither of them wanted the situation to be real, or maybe neither of them could handle if it became real.</p><p>Nodding, she chewed on the inside of her cheek. \u201cAnd how I\u2019ll feel if I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a second test and they began to walk down the aisle. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with, shall we?\u201d</p> <p>After paying for their purchases, they walked next door to the village\u2019s grocery store. Every so often, she\u2019d hear the distinct click of a camera.</p><p>\u201cDo you have your list?\u201d Sebastian asked casually. Cheerfully. As if their entire future wasn\u2019t in her purse and possibly her uterus.</p><p>Perplexed by his sudden mood swing, she asked, \u201cWhy are you so happy now?\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows and inclined his head slightly to the right. Another click. The doors to the grocery store opened as a woman, pushing a buggy with a small child in the front, darted through. The little boy babbled about something and the mother, replied with a, \u201cWait \u2018til we get home, Oliver, and then we\u2019ll play.\u201d</p><p>Daisy\u2019s heart rate kicked up. That could be her. Shopping. Alone and talking to her child, without actually understanding anything he was saying. She broke out in a cold sweat and her knees went all wobbly.</p><p>Somehow, she made it inside without falling flat on her face. The cool air and Sebastian\u2019s breezy attitude were actually calming her down. By the time they were done and headed back outside to his car, she was smiling and joking with him.</p><p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re on vacation doesn\u2019t mean I am,\u201d she reminded him, taking the little pot of African Violets from the buggy. \u201cI still have your brother\u2019s wedding to cater, which means more recipes to try out while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He maneuvered the buggy to the cart return. \u201cThere is a God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there is. Which reminds me, you made me forget to say my prayers last night, because I was too exhausted to even remember my name.\u201d They\u2019d climbed eleventy-billion steps at the ruins of an old keep built on the edge of a cliff. Sebastian had held her hand or arm the entire time, cautioning her against slipping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not helpless,\u201d she had joked.</p><p>Sliding his gaze to her stomach, and then back at her face, he had replied, \u201cBut I am.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t think about that. Be in this moment.</p><p>He gave her a funny look. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>She placed a hand on her hip. \u201cMy best friend is the daughter of a preacher. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she need never to meet mine.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The corner of Sebastian\u2019s mouth lifted. \u201cIn his spare time, Liam travels the world, challenging theists on their beliefs.\u201d</p><p>Isabella\u2019s spare time consisted of mission trips to third world countries, running faith-based food pantries and volunteering at women\u2019s shelters. \u201cYe-ah, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this is a topic best left to professionals,\u201d he said with a wink. \u201cReligion\u2019s not really my thing either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Frowning, she got in the car, watching as he jogged to the other side. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on converting you,\u201d she muttered to the interior as he joined her. \u201cExcept to putting the steering wheel on the right side.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door, fastened his seatbelt and started the engine. \u201cIt is on the right side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me.\u201d She gripped the door as he merged into traffic. \u201cI feel all discombobulated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on to your knickers.\u201d Laughing, he raced the car through the streets, making her stomach drop. She glared at him, but it was short-lived.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s house was a short drive from the center of town, or rather the village. It was a beautiful place, all charming shops and sidewalks lines with trees. They even had to drive over a bridge that crossed a river with large rocks and a mill with a water wheel that was still in use. In short, so far, her trip had lived up to every fantasy and Internet image she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>She sighed as they went through the opening in the tall brick wall surrounding his property and pulled onto the semi-circle gravel drive. The newly installed iron gates closed behind them, leaving behind the outside world and prying eyes.</p><p>Three stories of brick with ivy creeping up the sides, back and front, greeted them, with lots of big windows. There was a kitchen garden in the backyard, filled with every herb imaginable. Flowers beds were everywhere. Bees, butterflies, and hummingbird flitted and buzzed from flower to flower. Trees ancient and graceful bent toward the house, with shady bases perfect for reading.</p><p>It was charming.</p><p>Sebastian parked the car beside the old stable turned garage, and then raised her hand to his lips. \u201cYou look exhausted. Let me take care of the groceries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo all earls bring in their own groceries?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, devilishly handsome. \u201cThis earl does.\u201d</p><p>Another sigh.</p><p>He was charming.</p><p>She was in love, and possibly pregnant.</p><p>Oh God. She was in trouble.</p><p>Glancing down at the boxes in her purse, she took a depth breath. In about three minutes, she\u2019d find out just how much trouble.</p><p>Sebastian finished putting up the groceries in record time. Unfortunately.</p><p>He needed to find something else for them to do, because if he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d end up making love to her again.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t do that right now, not until they knew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to, uh...I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Her face turned as red as the roses that bloomed in the garden. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>One look at her retreating form and he sagged against the door to his art studio. He was terrified, not only of possibly becoming father but of the lie that still was between them. The lie he still hadn\u2019t fessed up to.</p><p>After today, he told himself. Let them get through today and he would reveal all. He would confess, move Heaven and earth, and if he had to, walk five hundred miles on his knees to beg her forgiveness.</p><p>He heard the toilet flush, the sound of water running, and the door swinging open. His stomach knotted tight, like a hangman\u2019s noose. He lurched towards the stairs and she met him halfway, her cheeks still bright flags of color.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we have a movie marathon today, instead of going everywhere?\u201d Daisy asked. \u201cI\u2019d like to finish your grand tour of the house, too.\u201d She\u2019d changed into her signature swingy skirt and form-fitting cardigan. The ring he\u2019d given to her caught his eye. Today, her chopsticks were the exact color of the pink diamond in the middle. He knew this, because he\u2019d had that pair made to match it.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mind if I watch whatever you pick through my eyelids,\u201d he said lightly. God, he would need to be at home if the results were positive.</p><p>He followed her up the stairs to the third floor. She entered the theater first.</p><p>\"I think I could live in your kitchen forever,\u201d Daisy said as he sat down beside her on a large sofa big enough for two grown men to stretch out on together. She curled her legs to the side and picked up his iPad.</p><p>\u201cYou only want me for my bun warmers?\u201d He thumped his chest and let out a mock groan of pain, deciding that humor was the only way he could calm them down. \u201cThat hurts, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBless your heart.\u201d She glanced down at his iPad, pressed the home button, and frowned. \u201cSpeaking of buns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>Handing him his iPad, she narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you read this, your royal ogleness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d He glanced at the screen to find a recent image of the two of them, only he\u2019d been captured checking out her ass. The article was filled with questions and quasi-facts. Apparently, the two of them were playing house and a close friend of Sebastian\u2019s told the Internet magazine\u2014in complete anonymity, of course\u2014that Daisy was set on having the new heir of Spenserfield.</p><p>He ignored that part and whistled. \u201cCheck out the bum on that bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bird\u2019s bum is mine, and you\u2019re the perv checking me out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it\u2014you liked it.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. Yeah, she\u2019d liked it. \u201cHmpf. Check out the next page,\u201d she said.</p><p>He swiped the screen. An image of her eyeing his arse loaded. As were the comments. After reading a few, he shutdown the machine. One should never read comments.</p><p>She turned to him. \u201cTime\u2019s up. I left my phone in your car. Be right back. I want to be able to call Isabella and Haven if I need to, that is... if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he murmured. Who would he call? His brother? His cousin? Liam?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute and I\u2019ll get the sticks. We can look at the...results together.\u201d She hurried to the door. \u201cAnd then make plans. Or not.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, listening to her light footsteps as she ran down the two flights of stairs and out the front door. After the first night, they\u2019d taken to using the side entrance to the house, which was a shame because the front door had been what sold the place for him. The heart-shaped knocker something he\u2019d thought Daisy would fanc\u2014he jumped to his feet.</p><p>\u201cShit, shit, shit,\u201d he chanted, running downstairs. Please don\u2019t let me be too late.</p><p>He yanked open the door and there Daisy stood, a sort of blank look on her face. \u201cDoes every house in England have heart-shaped door knockers?\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you buy this house?\u201d she asked, her voice thin.</p><p>\u201cLast spring. A very good friend said I needed to have a happy place,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cSo I bought this house with her in mind.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, and then shut it. Her pretty eyes became shiny with tears.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, darling. Shout at me...I don\u2019t care, but bloody hell, don\u2019t stay quiet,\u201d he said, reaching out to touch her.</p><p>She stumbled back, shaking her head. \u201cWhy? Of all the people in the world you could have messed with, why me? What did I ever do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I care about you.\u201d He took a step towards her.</p><p>\u201cYou only care about yourself,\u201d she spat.</p><p>He recoiled. Hadn\u2019t he said nearly the same words to his father after learning about Vladimir\u2019s deception? About his plans for a future Sebastian had no say in. Hadn\u2019t he done the very same thing to Daisy?</p><p>\u201cYou used me, and you lied to me the entire time.\u201d She struck her fist against her thigh. \u201cYou made me lie to the people I love, over and over again. I had to lie to strangers, to some poor woman, who for some unknown reason, is still in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I take that back. I know why she loves you, because you\u2019re this charming, tortured man who women think they can bring out the best in. You\u2019re the hero in every romance novel I\u2019ve read. A tortured soul who only needs the love of a good woman to save him. Ha! You\u2019re a liar, and the only thing you want is whatever suits you at the time. I refuse to do that anymore and I sure as hell refuse to save you,\u201d she added.</p><p>He stood there, unable to defend himself from the truth. Unable to do anything more than agree with her. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would do it again, Daisy.\u201d</p><p>She fisted her hands on her hips. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took a step towards her. \u201cI\u2019d lie, steal, and cheat to be with you. I\u2019d pretend to be another man if it meant you\u2019d give me one second of your time. If it meant I could show you another side of me, the one that I\u2019m bloody terrified to show anyone but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d really do this to me again? Are you really that obsessed with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI wanted you, I needed to have you, and by God, I got you. And. I. Would. Do. It. Again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou-you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another step and another, until he\u2019d successfully backed her into the corner by the front door. \u201cLet me put it another way, so you can understand the extreme depths of my obsession with you: I saw, I came inside of you\u2014\u201d He gently touched her belly and her hand caught him by the wrist, fingers tightening around it as his hand travelled lower, lower still to cup her through her skirt, \u201c\u2014and I conquered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConquered,\u201d Daisy choked out. \u201cYou conquered me?\u201d</p><p>No. You conquered me. But he was furious, he was a man, and he was a Romanov by God. It wasn\u2019t done to admit she held his heart in her hands, not when she could crush it at any moment. He moved his hand away and let his arms hang down at his side, fists clenching and heart pounding. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The world closed in around Daisy, shrinking and compressing her into a tight knot of raw nerves. How could she have been so stupid? Everything, the entire truth, had been right in front of her. His convenient knowledge of her likes and dislikes, where her parents were buried...everything. Would a background check have told him all that?</p> <p>And now! Now she could be pregnant with his child and tied to him forever.</p><p>Brushing past him, she swiped at her eyes and marched off in the opposite direction of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d she called out over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the results?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t handle anything else right now.\u201d She started walking, and then paused. \u201cPlease give me some time to think.\u201d</p> <p>His face softened. \u201cMy time belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>Biting the inside of her cheek so hard that fresh tears welled up, she took off in a run.</p><p>\u201cChrist. Don\u2019t run, Daisy,\u201d he said, his voice practically in her ear. \u201cYou could slip on the wet grass.\u201d</p><p>Her rain boots squeaked and she slowed to a jog. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone, if you promise to be careful,\u201d he said. The scent of him, all male, all expensive cologne and all... Sebastian seemed to wrap around her. She couldn\u2019t help but breathe him in. She couldn\u2019t help that she was still wet between her thighs from his blatant act of possession. From his reminder of the last time they\u2019d made love.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d Then she slowed even more, until she was walking.</p><p>Hearing the solid crunch of boots, she turned around again, ready to blast Sebastian for not leaving her alone. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Ivan smiled grimly. \u201cMr. Romanov said I must go with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you must.\u201d Frowning, she shoved her hands in her pocket and walked faster, splashing through puddles of water. She slowed down again when her boots slipped on a rock. On and on she walked, phone clenched in her hand, and mind on everything and nothing.</p><p>Here she was in a foreign land, unable to trust the man she thought she loved. Here she was in a foreign land, possibly pregnant by a man who\u2019d admitted he was obsessed with her.</p><p>Though his choice of words had echoed hers.</p><p>He\u2019d been mocking her, she realized.</p><p>Suddenly, a large shape began to emerge. All imposing lines and turrets rising out of the fog, like a fairy tale castle. Daisy forgot all about mocking, obsessions, pregnancy, and love.</p><p>All that was needed was a fancy carriage a la Cinderella racing up the gravel drive.</p><p>\u201cHawkfell Hall,\u201d Ivan intoned. \u201cMr. Romanov\u2019s family estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t live here?\u201d Her jaw dropped. Why in the world would he not want to live here?</p><p>\u201cNot since he was seventeen.\u201d</p><p>As she drew closer, busses and cars came into view. People loading and unloading. Some in formal wear while others were dressed casually, smart phones at the ready. A family posing in front of an intricate fountain had their picture taken by a photographer. Snacks were sold in a medieval-looking building.</p><p>A bride and groom kissed under an ornamental tree while the bridesmaids and groomsmen threw flower petals in the air.</p><p>He\u2019d turned his house into a tourist attraction and wedding venue? I\u2019ve finally sold the house I\u2019d shared with my father...</p><p>Well, she guessed his father would think he\u2019d sold it all right.</p><p>She paused by a beautifully painted sign, describing the grounds and the house. Private quarters are still maintained by the 10th Earl of Spenserfield in the North Wing. An odd pang hit her in the chest. Why didn\u2019t he live here, at least in the part that was still private?</p><p>\u201cThe generous Earl of Spenserfield, my arse,\u201d an older gentleman said, adjusting his cap. \u201cTraitor to God and Crown more like it.</p><p>His companion shushed him. \u201cThe current earl is a distant relative of Chetham. He didn\u2019t sell us to the Nazis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d another cut in. \u201cSo distant even I could be the earl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had that much money, you could\u2019ve bought the title for yourself.\u201d</p><p>The trio wandered off, joining a tour group.</p><p>Curious, Daisy bought a ticket and did the same.</p><p>Visually, the interior was beautiful, something out of a period movie, with high ceilings, large paintings, and ancient hardwood floors that went on for miles. Everything in the house screamed old money and an even older history.</p><p>\u201cThis portion of the Hall was used in Persuading My Lady. A bit of trivia\u2014the earl\u2019s twin brother had the leading role in the film,\u201d their tour guide revealed.</p><p>After a ninety-minute tour, the guide asked them to follow the exit signs out of the house.</p><p>Reluctantly, Daisy followed instructions, keeping with the group even as she spotted the door marked Private. She could pull up the insane amount of pictures on her phone of them to convince the powers-that-be she was the tenth earl\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, but decided against it.</p><p>If he\u2019d wanted to show her this part of his life, he could have, but he hadn\u2019t. So she would respect his decision and his privacy. Even if she thought he didn\u2019t deserve any of it.</p><p>Sighing, she marched past the door and outside, blinking at the sun that had finally chosen to come out from behind the clouds. Quickly finding an empty bench, she pulled out her phone and debated on texting Sebastian. She scanned the area, unable to locate Ivan. Most likely, he was hidden in the shadows somewhere, watching over her.</p><p>Her mind wandered to the results of the tests she\u2019d taken The results.</p><p>The RESULTS.</p><p>At least while she\u2019d been a tourist, her mind had been occupied, but now in the spring air, she watched families with babies. Every baby ever made caught her eye.</p><p>All. The. Babies.</p><p>Her vision blurred. Her eyes watered. Her breathing became shallow. Was she having a panic attack? Clutching her phone, she almost doubled over.</p><p>She let out a shaky breath and closed her eyes, letting the breeze cool her while she concentrated on the sound of bees buzzing and birds singing and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou are incredibly difficult to contact.\u201d</p><p>Eyes popping open, Daisy turned to find a well-dressed woman sitting beside her. She had pale blond hair and eyes the color of the flowers that dominated every bed on the estate. Daisy peered at her closer. The woman looked awfully familiar.</p><p>She really needed to stop closing her eyes out in public. \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d Daisy asked.</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look insane, but Daisy couldn\u2019t be too sure. \u201cUm, you look like a nice, reasonable person, but I can\u2019t help you with whatever you want. Maybe you should ask someone with a uniform.\u201d She stood, pocketing her phone. \u201cHave a nice day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to tour the private wing of the Hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s marked private, because it\u2019s private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nearly family, darling,\u201d the blond said, \u201cand as the future Dowager Countess of Spenserfield, I insist you let me give you a behind-the-scenes tour.\u201d</p><p>Daisy blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re Lady Francesca?\u201d This was the woman who\u2019d been emailing her, wanting to meet?</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d Lady Francesca mocked with a little smile. \u201cNow about that tour\u2014shall we? We have much to talk about, namely Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. If you want to talk to your son, then go to his house and do it instead of dancing on your ex-husband\u2019s grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd which house would Sebastian be occupying right now, darling? Or did he leave you here all alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re living in the village, on Chippleway Stre\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019d pick that one.\u201d Lady Francesca\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThank you for the invitation. I\u2019ll go there straightaway.\u201d</p><p>The fine hairs on Daisy\u2019s nape stood up. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t invite you,\u201d she called after her, but it was of no use.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s mother ignored her and went on her way without stopping.</p><p>Rubbing her temples, Daisy exhaled. She\u2019d had enough drama for one day. Sebastian could deal with his mother without her.</p><p>Sebastian shut the door and crossed his arms, leaning against the wall. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here,\u201d his brother mimicked, and then grinned. \u201cI was thinking there was just too much fun to be had in the world. So I thought to myself, who could remedy this tragedy, this great affliction of laughter and fun upon innocent bystanders? You, of course, came to mind first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSod off, Christian.\u201d Sebastian uncrossed his arms and ambled to the reception room. The bathroom door down the hall stayed firmly shut. He refused to enter it. He refused to look at the results, until she came home.</p><p>\u201cDaisy must love being here with only you for company,\u201d his brother said, his blue eyes missing nothing. \u201cAny biscuits in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>There were, along with every other sweet he liked, but they were made for him by her and he wasn\u2019t in the mood to share. Ever. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Christian shoved past him and made his way into the kitchen. Sebastian followed, stopping to wash his hands at the kitchen sink. He moved the pot of African violets slightly to the left and then dried his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou suck at lying, Bastian.\u201d Christian searched through the pantry, the cabinets, and the refrigerator, taking out everything he liked and needed before carrying it to the breakfast room. He set it all on the table and sat down, opening the closest container.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Zoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolland Springs.\u201d Christian tucked into a slice of lemon pound cake with poppy seed icing, groaning his appreciation. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t in love with my wife, I\u2019d marry Daisy. And if you weren\u2019t in love with Romanov Industries, you would, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. That actually requires feelings. Never mind,\u201d he added, punctuating his insult with a wave of his fork.</p><p>\u201cGet to the point,\u201d Sebastian said, eying the lemon tarts. Daisy had finished baking those right before they\u2019d left for the grocery store this morning. Before she\u2019d found him out and he\u2019d mucked things up with his prideful nature. And the truth. He would do it again. \u201cWhat\u2019s the real reason you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>Wiping his mouth with a napkin, Christian leaned back in the chair. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever expected his brother to say. \u201cAbout me? What for?\u201d</p><p>An uneasy look crossed his twin\u2019s face and he tapped his fingers against the table. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, you\u2019re not yourself. I think you\u2019ve taken things too far.\u201d</p><p>Confronted with his brother\u2019s concern, Sebastian didn\u2019t say anything at first. Instead, he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cI assure you I am exactly the same.\u201d Deceitful, dishonest...listening to the monster that lived inside of his head.</p><p>\u201cSo you say, but... My God, look at what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeans and a t-shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Christian threw his napkin on the table and flicked his hands out. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve been in the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week, but I fail to see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you out of the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He drew his brows together. \u201cShould I have been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, until you turned up,\u201d Sebastian replied without hesitation and his brother shot him the bird. Where was Christian going with this?</p><p>\u201cDid Daisy make you take her on a tour of London, or did you volunteer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little of both.\u201d Everything she\u2019d seen had been an adventure to her. Every church, every tourist trap, and every shop an event worth taking about fifty million pictures.</p><p>He smiled fondly at the memory. At least he would have those. She couldn\u2019t take his memories away.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Christian snapped, rising to his feet.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d Sebastian asked, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cYou never smile like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m not allowed to smile, have fun, or miss work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun...have fun?\u201d Christian began to pace the length of the room, hands clasped behind his back. \u201cThis is the only time you\u2019ve ever missed work, excluding the stunt you pulled when you fucking disappeared for six months, without a bloody word to anyone, including me. Hell, Bastian, you took a lunch hour to attend Vlad\u2019s funeral. Nothing is more important to you than Romanov Industries. I\u2019m right, yes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sebastian didn\u2019t answer. He couldn\u2019t, because he was too ashamed to admit that he had disappeared because he was about to have a mental breakdown. He\u2019d disappeared because he\u2019d been too weak to stand up to Vladimir and running away was his only option. So he\u2019d flown to Alaska, to the most northern part that was habitable by man and simply lived there, in a village, and learned to fend for himself.</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t helped, not really.</p><p>Suddenly, it dawned on Sebastian the real reason why his brother was here. The pictures. Christian needed Sebastian to take the heat again. \u201cI\u2019ve informed James to have the video taken down from YouTube. No one will dispute the bloody pictures. \u201d</p> <p>His brother paused, rubbing a hand over the back of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the pictures. I should own up to them anyway. It\u2019s me in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your career. All you\u2019ve worked for thrown away just like,\u201d Sebastian snapped his fingers, \u201cthat. Are you mad?\u201d</p><p>Christian pointed at him. \u201cYou I recognize.\u201d He plopped down in the nearest chair. \u201cFor a moment, you had me going. Flew all this way for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me keep you from flying back.\u201d Sebastian nodded in the direction of the foyer. \u201cI have plans with Daisy tonight.\u201d</p><p>Christian raised his brows and smirked. \u201cGoing over profit margins for her catering business?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he said lightly, unable to confide his fear to his brother.</p><p>\u201cSome things never change and they never should, I guess. Might make the world stop spinning.\u201d Christian grabbed several biscuits, wrapped them up in a napkin, and stood. \u201cCheers, Bastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a safe flight home, and tell Zoe I said hello,\u201d Sebastian said, walking with Christian to the foyer.</p><p>Christian nodded. \u201cI know the way out.\u201d</p><p>Just as his brother closed the front door, the French doors in the kitchen swung open, and Ivan burst inside, dripping wet. \u201cI lost her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost who?\u201d Panic swelled inside of him, threatening to explode.</p> <p>Ivan flicked water off his hands. \u201cThe little countess disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell did that happen?\u201d The worst possible situations flashed through Sebastian\u2019s mind. She\u2019d left him, without a note of goodbye. Someone had kidnapped her and he\u2019d soon get a note asking for money. A member of his family had kidnapped her and he\u2019d soon receive a package with her finger or hand in it, if he didn\u2019t come back into the family fold.</p><p>Grabbing his phone and shoving it into his pocket, he strode to a large picture on the far wall and swung it open. The safe had been installed the day after he closed on it. He punched in the code, opened it, and reached inside to pull out a Glock similar to the one Ivan carried.</p><p>He examined it. All three safety features remained activated, until he pulled the trigger. Smiling grimly, he shoved it in the waistband of his jeans and pulled his t-shirt over it.</p><p>Starting for the door, he pivoted and headed to the bathroom. Without hesitation, he barged inside, read the instructions she\u2019d left on the counter, and then studied the sticks.</p><p>His heart careened wildly for a moment, relief palpable at finally having an answer.</p><p>\u201cMr. Romanov?\u201d Ivan called from the back.</p><p>Sebastian left the bathroom, determined strides matching his mood. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>They exited the house through the French doors. The wet grass was slick beneath his boots as the sun sank below the horizon. Fog had begun to roll in\u2014naturally. \u201cTell Boris to bring flashlights.\u201d</p><p>Ivan followed. \u201cI\u2019ve secured the perimeter around Hawkfell Hall. No Romanovs, besides your brother and mother, have been spotted in the area.\u201d</p><p>Of course his mother had been there. She\u2019d probably been doing her weekly dancing on Vladimir\u2019s grave routine.</p><p>He and Ivan walked the property for an hour, finding no sign of her. No amount of texts or voice mails made her return his calls. He could only hope she was still too mad and hurt to answer him.</p><p>\u201cSecurity cameras show her dashing off in the direction of the lake,\u201d Ivan said as he hung up his phone.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Pulling out his phone, he texted Daisy one last time. Where are you?</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him and his body became cold. Numb. He\u2019d never forgive himself if something had happened to her, whether by accident or on purpose.</p><p>He ran for the lake.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, he stood at the edge of the water and shielded his eyes with his hand.</p><p>He found Daisy, sitting at the boat launch with her feet in the water.</p><p>Relief shot through him so quickly that his knees went weak. She was safe. She\u2019d been safe the entire time. Relief gave way to righteous anger.</p><p>He handed Ivan his gun. \u201cGive us some privacy.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Small fish nibbled at her feet, tickling her, but Daisy didn\u2019t have the strength to smile or laugh.</p><p>When she\u2019d first found this spot a couple of hours ago, she\u2019d still been mad. Still had been hurt and unwilling to think Sebastian was anything but heartless. Was anything but a man worth knowing.</p><p>But the longer she sat, the more she began to think that she could have been wrong to have let her temper fly so hot. She could have been a little hasty in writing him off. After all, he was still Jules. He was still the man who\u2019d been there for her through the never-ending bills, through her breakup with Glen, through selling her house...everything.</p><p>He was also the man who\u2019d used his knowledge of her to do nothing but good things. Thoughtful things, like showing up when she needed someone. Buying her cupcakes for outrageous sums of money. Telling off Glen and Nina. Remembering everything she liked and didn\u2019t, had offered to pay for her bills by purchasing a billion cupcakes...and a whole host of things that people who cared about each other did.</p><p>But he\u2019d lied to her.</p><p>Only\u2014what made her so pure and good?</p><p>She\u2019d been willing to lie for him for money. He lied to her for no other reason than to get to know her, to let her get to know him. The side, he\u2019d confessed, that he was terrified to share with anyone else.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell haven\u2019t you answered my calls?\u201d</p><p>Turning, she was stunned to see Sebastian standing beside her, his face harsh and his blue eyes like hot flames.</p><p>Her heart stuttered.</p><p>Despite everything he still made her heart beat fast, he still made her sigh, and...he was still her Jules. He was still her Sebastian, and had become everything to her.</p><p>\u201cDid you actually fly to my house the night Glen broke up with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>So her mind hadn\u2019t been playing tricks on her. \u201cAnd when you sent me the celebrity look-alike picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was actually me at a bachelor party for Prince Damien. Christian has the exact same suit.\u201d</p><p>All along, he\u2019d been giving her clues but she hadn\u2019t bothered to investigate them, mostly because it seemed outrageous. Heck, becoming his fianc\u00e9e was outrageous, yet she had done it anyway.</p><p>\u201cDoes your time still belong to me, Jules?\u201d she asked softly, not moving. Sebastian looked dark, dangerous, like he\u2019d pounce on her at any moment if she breathed too deeply.</p><p>His face softened, just a little, and then he held out his hand. \u201cCome with me, love.\u201d</p><p>Time seemed to stand still.</p><p>Slowly, she got to her feet and put her hand in his. He jerked her to him, his fingers going to her hair and taking out the chopsticks. They fell on the cement dock with a small thud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you more.\u201d He started in the direction of The Hall, his long legs eating up the distance. She had to jog to keep up with him.</p><p>\u201cWell, I did want the private tour,\u201d she said as they entered the family entrance.</p><p>Sebastian came to a sudden halt, backing her into a nearby corner. \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m barely holding on by a thread. The things I want to do to you right now aren\u2019t civilized.\u201d</p><p>Desire arched between them. She ran a finger down the front of his shirt, and then slipped her hand underneath. His stomach contracted and he drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat name should I scream when you\u2019re inside of me\u2014Jules or Bastian?\u201d</p><p>He was on her in an instant, fingers digging into her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t care as long as you know it\u2019s me. As long as you know I\u2019m the one making you scream in the first place.\u201d Then his mouth came down on hers, his tongue breaching her lips easily.</p><p>\u201cWhich you\u2014Jules or Bastian?\u201d she asked as his teeth caught the lobe of her ear. She gasped in pleasure. His hand found its way under her skirt and ripped off her panties.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, she did as he asked. He slipped a long finger inside of her sex, finding her shamelessly wet. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want this, tell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this. You,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. She trembled, but not in fear. This was how she always wanted to Glen to be with her. Demanding, yet concerned for her pleasure. Sebastian\u2019s thumb pressed against her swollen clit and she moaned. His finger left her and she began to protest, until she heard the rough slide of his zipper, then the silken nudge of his cock as he bent his knees.</p><p>\u201cTook my piercing out earlier, so...\u201d The head of him entered her and he flexed his hips, driving deep. She cried out in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWait...we don\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He dragged his lips across her throat and slid the smallest of distances inside of her. She grew wetter and groaned. He nipped at her chin. \u201cYes, you are. Two results, same answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hap\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bloody terrified.\u201d He cupped a breast, thumb brushing a hard nipple. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>She arched her throat and he nibbled his way up, finding the sensitive spot just below her ear. \u201cI\u2019m happy and scared...and you\u2019re making it impossible for me to think straight right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk. Later.\u201d</p><p>No further words were needed. He grasped her hips, digging his fingers in. If anyone came down this hallway, they would get an eyeful, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>A delicious friction built up with every thrust. Her entire being centered on where they were joined. Flesh to flesh, their clothes separating them. Tension built. Desire flamed high. She wrapped her arms around him, holding on for dear life.</p><p>Her body burst into flames, tension snapped inside of her, giving way to wave after wave of pleasure. He surged against her, his body growing taut as he growled her name.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Bastian,\u201d she whispered as the tension left him and the room. \u201cNow tell me your real name.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Sebastian could barely drag in enough air, he was panting so hard. Anger and desire had merged together, taking over his body and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI love you, Bastian,\u201d Daisy whispered. \u201cNow tell me your real name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d he asked, leaning back slightly to look at her. She gave him a tremulous smile. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>This required his entire brain, not just the one he\u2019d been thinking with when he\u2019d ripped off her panties. He let himself slip out of her and readjusted his clothes. \u201cEven after all the lies and what I said earlier about conquer\u2014\u201d</p><p>She placed a finger against his lips. \u201cEven after all of that.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the tip of her finger before she gently pushed it away. \u201cTell me your real name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSebastian Julian Westmoreland Romanov. Jules is short for Julian. I\u2019m named for my mother\u2019s father, the Duke of Everham.\u201d He gave her a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cSo you gave me part of the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Brushing back her dark hair, he took her hand, lacing their fingers together. \u201cBut I meant every word of every email, every text, every chat...those were me, Daisy.\u201d</p><p>Truth colored his words, bright and bold.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go home, Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t any shoes on,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOh. Can we stay here or will you get Ivan to pick us up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Taking her hand in his, he steered her down the hallway and to the right, stopping at a bathroom along the way. \u201cI\u2019d rather not stay here. My memories of this place growing up weren\u2019t the best,\u201d he said through the cracked open door while she cleaned up.</p><p>Opening the door, she stepped out and gazed at him, happiness radiating from her.</p><p>The color in her face was nearly back to normal, though he knew the blush in her cheeks and the sparkle in her eyes had been put there by him. She\u2019d fixed her hair, piling it into a large bun on top of her head, streams of multi-colored tips sticking out every which way.</p><p>She was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWhat about now?\u201d she asked, her head tilting to one side.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter...\u201d She glanced down the hall, in the direction they had traveled only seconds ago.</p><p>\u201cOh? Yes, well, that certainly\u2014\u201d He flushed and bit his lip, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>She stared at him in bemusement.</p><p>Yes, he, the Earl of Spenserfield, the former president of Romanov Industries, was actually blushing over sex. But it wasn\u2019t over sex. It was over the connection that flowed between them, the love in her eyes, and his baby inside of her. Dipping his head, his peered at her through his lashes, unable to quite meet her eyes.</p><p>Gently taking his chin in her hand, she tipped it up. \u201cNever be embarrassed with me, Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lo\u2014not here,\u201d he quickly amended. No way he\u2019d tell her here. They needed to be at home, at The Rectory. Safe, dry, and warm while tucked into bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quickly navigating a maze of hallways, they soon arrived in a tastefully decorated room, much like the one in his London home. She paused at the fireplace.</p><p>Above the mantle hung a portrait of Vladimir, Lady Francesca, and two young boys\u2014one small and frail looking, the other strong and tall.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s who?\u201d she asked, head back as she stared at the painting.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the one on the right. My mother always complained I\u2019d stolen Christian\u2019s good health and her figure when we were little.\u201d</p><p>Daisy glanced back at him. \u201cOne twin is always bigger than the other and a lot of times healthier, too. You had no control over that. As for the other...she can get over herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to convey your message to her,\u201d he said, amused and grateful for her defense.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave at seventeen?\u201d</p><p>He almost lied to her. He almost told her that he\u2019d left because he\u2019d wanted to travel the world during his Gap Year, but he couldn\u2019t. \u201cI found out that my title, this house, this estate...my past and my future had been bought from the rightful heirs.\u201d</p> <p>Turning, she gazed up at him. \u201cI saw a show once where the winner won an English title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cMy father paid off the rightful Earl of Spenserfield and took his place. The title and the estate had been sitting here, rotting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he want it or why was it rotting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>She wandered over to a club chair by the fireplace and sat down.</p> <p>He grabbed a remote off a side table and clicked on the fire. \u201cNeat!\u201d she said, unable to contain her excitement, and then she schooled her expression. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. If I were seeing this place for the first time, I\u2019d think it neat as well,\u201d he offered and maneuvered her so that he was the one in the chair and she was in his lap. He placed a possessive hand on her stomach and she leaned back, laying her head on his shoulder and propping her legs across the width of the chair.</p><p>Holding her like this, he felt safe. She lightly scratched at the nape of his neck. He breathed her in, honey and vanilla mixed in the flowery scent of her shampoo. A man could get used to this, even a man who thought himself to be a monster.</p><p>\u201cChetham, the earl at the time, apparently sided with the Nazis during the first World War. The Crown tried him for treason, found him guilty, and took everything away. He wasn\u2019t the only titled gentleman to be tried. There were barons, viscounts, and a duke, I believe. Later, they revised the ruling and declared that any heirs could reclaim their title and the estates. So far, Vladimir has been the only one to do so. It was bad enough to live with the taint of that, going to school and being the heir to a treasonous title wasn\u2019t the easiest thing, but I worshipped my father. He didn\u2019t care what everyone else thought, only his opinion of himself mattered. He was a god in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo, when I found out he\u2019d bought the title, that we weren\u2019t actually related to Chetham at all... Let\u2019s just say that my hero worship began to die a slow, painful death and I let it be known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worshiped him despite all the stuff he did to you?\u201d Daisy asked slowly.</p><p>\u201cI did. I loved him, even when he marked me with the Romanov tattoo on my back,\u201d he said, staring into the fire. \u201cI should be proud, he said. I should be grateful for the blood running in my veins, he said. It could be worse, he said. I could have given you a bloody rose on your chest like Christian.\u201d</p><p>All over a fifteen-year-old boy\u2019s temper, all over Sebastian shouting in front of the wrong people at the wrong time that he hated being a Romanov. For his punishment, he been held down, tied up, and forced to endure hours of pain as one of his father\u2019s bodyguard inked him.</p> <p>\u201cTry denying me now, boy,\u201d his father had spat as Sebastian had struggled to his feet. His back burned, his skin felt stretched and thin.</p><p>He\u2019d stumbled and instead of reaching out to steady him, his father had kicked his legs out from under him.</p><p>The touch of her hand on his pulled him back to the present. \u201cDo you want to talk about it anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He caressed her stomach, slow easy glides that hitched up her shirt and made it possible for him to touch her bare skin. It was hot and smooth beneath his palm.</p><p>\u201cThat feels very nice.\u201d She made a little noise, a sort of purring sound of pleasure. He kissed the top of her head and smiled against her hair, then frowned at her lack of concern. Shouldn\u2019t she be running away from him, yelling at him that monsters bred monsters?</p><p>Like his mother had? Oh holy hell, he had mother and father issues. Actually, he just had issues. Screwed up, needed-to-be fixed issues.</p><p>None of that seemed to bother Daisy.</p><p>Don\u2019t you think it makes me a monster?</p><p>No, it makes you human.</p><p>Even then, when he\u2019d bared his soul to her in their texts, she\u2019d not judged him. She\u2019d listened and given comfort. Maybe it wasn\u2019t so unreasonable to believe he was worth loving.</p><p>She snuggled deeper into his arms, her body relaxing into his in soft degrees until he knew she was asleep.</p><p>Ivan ambled inside, his eyes missing nothing, yet the bodyguard remained the epitome of discretion. \u201cShall I bring the car around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s time I take the little countess\u201d\u2014Sebastian flashed a smile as he stood, cradling the woman he loved against his chest.\u2014\u201chome, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome is where she is, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Ivan\u2019s lips stretched over his teeth.</p><p>Raising his brows, Sebastian nodded once in answer, and started for the private entry on the east side of The Hall.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me, Daisy?\u201d he asked, but he knew she wouldn\u2019t answer. She was still sleeping.</p><p>However, the real question remained\u2014would he have the courage to ask her while she was awake?</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>The next day, Sebastian asked her to attend a swanky charity event with him. Though he hadn\u2019t said the word swanky, she knew it would be.</p><p>So, she\u2019d put on her sexiest dress and highest heels. He\u2019d worn a tux and a charming smile.</p><p>Neither one of them had been able to keep their hands off each other while they were getting ready, while they rode in the back of the limo, or even when they first arrived.</p><p>But no one seemed to care. Some looked downright shocked, but not because they were humping each other in public.</p><p>No, it was the open affection he showed her. The way he brushed her hair away from her face or took her hand and kissed it. Apparently to the people who knew Sebastian that was the same thing as a preacher deciding to streak down the aisle in the middle of a church service.</p><p>Music swelled in the background and she turned her attention to him once more.</p><p>\u201cFeeling alright?\u201d Sebastian placed a hand at the small of her back and brushed her stomach with his free one. \u201cNeed to sit?\u201d Without waiting for her answer, he propelled her to their table at the front and pulled out her chair.</p><p>He looked anxious. He looked a little lost. She inwardly smiled. \u201cMay I have a glass of ice water?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Relief broke over his face. He had needed something to do. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until dinner is served.\u201d</p><p>After pressing a fleeting kiss to the back of her hand, he took off like a shot. She glanced around the magnificent ballroom. It dripped with elegance and money, lots and lots of money.</p><p>There was a sea of tuxes and designer ball gowns. A three-piece band played soothing music while servers in black pants and white shirts buzzed around the tables like bees. She couldn\u2019t help but notice how efficient they were, and how smoothly everything ran.</p><p>Someday she\u2019d like to cater an event like this, but most likely, she\u2019d never get the chance. Holland Springs might have more billionaires and millionaires than the average town, but this cosmopolitan gathering for charity was something straight out of a book.</p><p>\u201cI see you finally wore the Valentino. You look smashing.\u201d</p><p>Daisy blinked at Kate, and then stammered out a thank you.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t follow the two of you here.\u201d Kate waved a cream-colored piece of paper at Daisy, before slipping it into her purse. \u201cI was invited long before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were following us.\u201d Daisy craned her neck, wishing for Sebastian to show up with her water. \u201cWhere are you sitting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Daisy jerked her attention back to Kate. \u201cHere here?\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed, throwing her head back as she did, her ebony hair all caught up in a diamond tiara. She looked like a princess. \u201cHave you bothered to read the name cards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Daisy picked up a card in the shape of a house. Sebastian Romanov, Earl of Spenserfield, was written in silver ink. She set it back down and read the one beside her. Kate Von Lichtenstein. A quick glance to her left let her know that her name wasn\u2019t on that house either. A hot flush stole up her neck and down her chest. Where the heck was she supposed to sit? \u201cSebastian and I just arrived.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s jade eyes were assessing as she raked Daisy with a snooty gaze. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d bring you to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d Kate exhaled. \u201cI coming off as a real witch, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy momma said that if you can\u2019t say something nice, then you shouldn\u2019t say anything at all. So I\u2019m going to keep real quiet while you dig yourself out of this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see you with him. It\u2019s even harder to see him so happy, yet so anxious over you.\u201d Kate gazed out into the ballroom, and Daisy followed her line of vision.</p><p>In the center of it all stood Sebastian, holding a goblet of water while talking with a rather imposing looking gentleman.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my father, the Baron,\u201d Kate said. \u201cHe and Sebastian have much in common.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian turned his head slightly, and she felt an electric surge go through her. It heated her, down to her very toes. Before they\u2019d left this evening, he\u2019d informed her what he planned on doing to her on the ride back home.</p><p>His sexy mouth lifted at one corner and he winked, like he knew she was thinking of that very conversation.</p><p>\u201cAnd it appears you and I have much in common as well,\u201d Kate murmured. \u201cHe is extraordinarily attentive in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHe and I were very young the first and only time we ah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get over the man who\u2019s your first love.\u201d</p><p>Daisy pictured Glen\u2019s face and made a soft noise. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s easier than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m even here.\u201d Kate placed her purse on the table. \u201cThis is torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe music\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Daisy said, hoping Kate would take the hint. \u201cA drummer would be nice.\u201d</p><p>Kate leaned forward in her chair, studying her. \u201cIf you were anyone but his, I would stay here beside you and spend an enjoyable evening. But I can\u2019t. I thought I could, but it\u2019s too damn hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way,\u201d Daisy said, grateful that she could face Sebastian\u2019s ex with the truth on her side. \u201cBut I do love him, and I am his. All that said, I do hope you find someone who makes you happier than he ever could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very sweet. I don\u2019t know if I could be so kind,\u201d Kate said. A tear escaped the corner of one eyes and she brushed it away with a knuckle. \u201cMaybe I should follow the Romanov example and find someone who\u2019s not what people would expect.\u201d</p><p>Then she rose, in a cloud of sweet-smelling perfume and designer silk, and left before Sebastian arrived at Daisy\u2019s side with her water.</p><p>\u201cWas she rude?\u201d</p><p>Daisy took the water and drank greedily. \u201cShe was sad.\u201d</p><p>He sat down beside her. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten she was to be my date for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour date!\u201d Daisy sat her drink down.</p><p>\u201cThe event was planned last year. It was her choice to attend this event anyway. She had to know I\u2019d bring you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill...no wonder she was so upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re glowing, in fact.\u201d He slid his gaze to her stomach and then back at her face.</p><p>She blushed. \u201cNow I am.\u201d</p><p>He eased his hand inside the split in the side of her dress. It stopped mid-thigh but his hand did not. \u201cYou\u2019re very warm, too.\u201d She gasped as the tips of his fingers brushed her most intimate parts. \u201cVery, very warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve placed my bid. Shall we leave before dinner is served?\u201d He slowly slid his hand from where she was wet and slid a finger over his lower lip, then licked it. Her entire body throbbed in response, like one enormous beat of her heart. \u201cMy car is waiting.\u201d</p><p>They stood as one, racing past everyone and not caring who turned up their nose or smiled fondly. Once the car door closed behind them, Daisy launched herself at Sebastian, kissing him hungrily. He laughed into her mouth and she drank in the sound.</p><p>A large hand eased up her dress once more and she moaned. He parted her, entering her with one long finger. Her inner muscles clutched at him. Working at the bodice, he managed to free one of her breasts and wrapped a hot mouth around it. She arched, back bowing off the seat.</p><p>\u201cTake your hair down,\u201d he murmured against her wet flesh.</p><p>With hands trembling, she removed the diamond barrette he\u2019d given her to wear tonight from her hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGorgeous.\u201d He stroked her, easing another finger inside of her and curling them.</p><p>She grabbed his wide shoulders and held on for a moment.</p><p>The car began to move and she fell back against the seat again.</p> <p>He stayed with her, his fingers teasing and the thumb he\u2019d pressed against her swollen clitoris torturing her.</p><p>\u201cDo you always get to third base in the back of a limo?\u201d</p><p>Lifting his head from her breast, he gave her a puzzled look. \u201cThird base?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down. Her dress was around her waist and his fingers were sunk deep inside of her. \u201cThat\u2019s third base.\u201d</p><p>Comprehension dawned and he grinned wickedly. \u201cShall I tell you the truth or\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe truth,\u201d she said. \u201cAlways tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He slid out his fingers and plunged in again. \u201cThird base, second...first...are there any others?\u201d</p><p>She giggled, and then moaned when he nipped at her shoulder. \u201cHome, you forgot home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my home,\u201d Sebastian said, gazing into her beautiful face. Her cheeks were stained pink and her eyes were smoky with desire. He wasn\u2019t a glib man, not like his brother or cousin. He wasn\u2019t given to quoting poetry. Occasionally quoting pop culture references wasn\u2019t by any means romantic, but he could use his hands, his lips, and tongue to worship her. He would use every part of his body to bring her pleasure.</p><p>So he did just that, until she trembled and cried out his name. Watching her come undone in his arms was the most powerful thing he\u2019d ever done in his life.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>Her lashes fluttered, eyes refocusing as she came down to earth. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He couldn\u2019t say it again, not even knowing she felt the same way. Something held him back. \u201cI love the way you look when you orgasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sounded disappointed but he wasn\u2019t sure, because she gave him a blinding smile and kissed him softly. \u201cThank you for a very nice time.\u201d</p><p>Thank you, he wanted to reply, for saving me from my bleak existence, but he didn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.</p><p>Four days later, after dining on an amazing lunch prepared by Daisy, Sebastian took her by the hand and led her away from the kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019ll wash them up later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said and opened the door at the end of the hallway with a flourish. \u201cThis is one thing you don\u2019t know about me. No one does, in fact.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew wide, taking in the paintings and sketches. Some were priceless works by artists long dead while their names lived on while others were his, humble and framed on the opposite wall. Maybe one day.</p> <p>\u201cDid you paint all these?\u201d She gestured to the wall with his work.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her, settling his hands around her waist and clasping them in the front. \u201cDoes that impress you?\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms. \u201cA lot.\u201d Rising on her tiptoes, she kissed him and said, \u201cMaybe our baby will have your talent.\u201d</p><p>Something sweet washed over him. \u201cWould it be so bad if he or she were entirely like you instead?\u201d</p><p>Sympathy clouded her eyes. \u201cI wish you could see yourself through my eyes.\u201d</p><p>He had. He\u2019d seen himself at his worst, cruelly mocking her. \u201cHmm,\u201d he said and guided her to the fainting couch by a set of French doors.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d Sympathy gave way to sparkling anticipation.</p><p>\u201cLie there and don\u2019t move,\u201d he ordered, taking great delight as she did as he asked. He unbuttoned her shirt, spreading it outward and revealing the curves of her breasts and creamy skin.</p><p>For days, he had wanted to share his studio, where he painted and sketched. It was his favorite room in the house, aside from the bedroom, to be in. And now she was here, lying on an antique fainting couch made of silk and velvet.</p><p>She raised her hands over her head and stretched. His mouth ran dry. \u201cLike this?\u201d Her full lips curved and he sucked in a breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to do you justice, but I shall endeavor.\u201d He kneeled beside her and dipped his head, dropping a kiss in the deep vee of her cleavage. \u201cThe bra will have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, son, in the middle of the day?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian jumped up and away from the lounger, heat creeping up his neck as he turned to face their intruder. \u201cHello, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>\u201cNow she shows up?\u201d Daisy muttered. She scrambled off the lounger and onto her feet, buttoning her shirt. She slipped her hand in his and gave it a supportive squeeze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bloody stand there like a plank, Sebastian. Mind your manners and properly greet your mother,\u201d Lady Francesca ordered, sweeping into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Sebastian asked.</p><p>Francesca swept off her hat. \u201cNo maid or butler?\u201d She held out the hat to Daisy. \u201cTake this and put\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sebastian stepped in front of Daisy, obscuring her view of his mother. \u201cShe\u2019s not your servant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever, I\u2019m sure she is serving you. You\u2019ve certainly brought her to the right place.\u201d</p><p>The right place? Daisy frowned. A preacher and his family had lived here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll thank you to keep your opinions to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFact number one: Your father used this house to keep his English mistresses here. Fact number two: I\u2019ve come to warn your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>Daisy stuck her head out from behind Sebastian\u2019s wide shoulders and let go of his hand. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh she speaks, and you allow it.\u201d Francesca smirked. \u201cHow charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Sebastian growled.</p><p>\u201cLeave him. Immediately.\u201d</p><p>Stepping around Sebastian, she faced his mother head on. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now you don\u2019t. Not while he\u2019s so like his father at the beginning of things: charming, lovable, vulnerable...sharing the bits about his oh so very tragic childhood. Poor, misunderstood man that can only be changed for the better with the love of a good woman. How could anyone resist that? I certainly didn\u2019t. But when reality sinks in and you realize that you\u2019ll always be second and sometimes third best, you\u2019ll wish you had listened to me.\u201d Francesca extended her hand. \u201cCome, let\u2019s go for a drive and I\u2019ll give you the real story.\u201d</p><p>Daisy glanced up at Sebastian. There was a tic in jaw and his hands had clenched into fists. \u201cBastian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo if you like,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI\u2019ll not make the choice for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>He slid his gaze to her, his eyes flashing.</p><p>\u201cI choose you,\u201d she said simply, taking his hand and gently prying it open. She pressed a kiss to the center of his palm. \u201cI choose your facts. Your memories over a woman who couldn\u2019t be bothered to stay or even fight for her children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe bothered?\u201d Francesca screeched. \u201cI discovered Vladimir banging my sister on that very lounger, in this very room. And you knew about the affair the entire time.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian shook his head. \u201cChristian knew, not me. He was our father\u2019s lookout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop maligning him! That poor lad has been through enough because of you. You stole everything from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a grown man. And you\u2019ve got your knickers in a wad because he didn\u2019t invite you to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn oversight, I\u2019m sure. Besides, my sources tell me Christian was spotted at Heathrow this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter get new sources, because Christian is already back home. He didn\u2019t come here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Francesca whined. \u201cZoe said she would talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because my sister-in-law is too damned nice to say no.\u201d</p><p>This was not a conversation she needed to continue to hear or witness. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go bake something.\u201d Daisy tried to leave. She inched toward the door and wiggled her fingers, but Sebastian tightened his grip. So, she took a deep breath and stayed by his side.</p><p>\u201cGet it through your head, Francesca. We. Don\u2019t. Want. You,\u201d he said.</p><p>Francesca took a step closer, her hand darting out and slapping Sebastian across the face. \u201cYou\u2019re him all over again. She\u2019ll never be enough for you. Kate wasn\u2019t enough for you. No woman ever will be.\u201d</p><p>Daisy stared in horror at the red handprint that stood out in vivid contrast to his pale face. \u201cPlease Sebastian, if you let go, I can get some ice.\u201d This time he let go of her. She rushed to the kitchen, grabbing a towel and filling it with crushed ice. Her hands shook as she dashed into the room, bits of ice falling to the floor.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why I married that bastard?\u201dFrancesca asked and Daisy skidded to a stop just at the entrance to the room.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s gaze met hers, over his mother\u2019s head, but there was nothing behind his blue eyes. \u201cShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you and your bother. Your father seduced me, on purpose. I had to get married because I ended up pregnant and thought I loved him,\u201d Francesca said, her voice shaking. \u201cVladimir said the first time he saw me, he had to have me. He wanted me like he\u2019d never wanted another woman. Who could resist that? Only I didn\u2019t know the truth until a few years later. Romanovs conquered. They took, without asking, using any means available. He didn\u2019t want me\u2014he wanted what I could give him\u2014respectability and a son who would inherit a Dukedom someday.\u201d</p><p>Daisy swallowed a scream, of denial or outrage, she wasn\u2019t sure. Sebastian\u2019d said almost the very same thing to her. I saw you. I came. I conquered. I wanted you. I needed you. I\u2019d lie, steal, and cheat...and I\u2019d do it again.</p><p>Doubt seized hold of her, razor-sharp claws digging into her heart.</p><p>Was their entire engagement a front for his real purpose? Had he engineered the entire thing: from his firing to his public bad behavior, because he really was obsessed with her?</p><p>The first time I saw you...</p><p>... so you can understand the extreme depths of my obsession with you...</p><p>Sebastian stood, straight and tall, his face impassioned as Francesca began to pace. His eyes closed briefly, then impassioned gave way to raw shame, and Daisy\u2019s heart broke for him.</p><p>If he really was this evil imitation of his father, would he feel anything, least of all shame? Taking a deep breath, Daisy marched into the room.</p><p>\u201cOnly he couldn\u2019t wait that long, so he shamed my family by buying Chetham\u2019s title. That\u2019s why your grandfather won\u2019t have anything to do with any of us.\u201d Francesca shook her head, pausing in front of the wall of paintings, her pretty face contorting. \u201cVladimir\u2019s death hasn\u2019t changed anything, damn him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d Daisy ordered, going toe to toe with the woman. \u201cTake your nasty mouth and nasty lies and get the hell out of our house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, there\u2019s a cast iron skillet in the kitchen, and I know how to use it,\u201d Daisy bluffed. Although she really, really wanted to smack the woman. \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about cooking either.\u201d</p><p>Francesca gasped. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ivan chose that moment to walk into the room.</p><p>Daisy smiled. \u201cIvan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa, Countess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrying pan, the big black one. It\u2019s in the cabinet beside the oven.\u201d</p><p>He lumbered off.</p><p>Daisy crossed her arms, smirking at her. \u201cAnything else you want to say before you leave?\u201d</p><p>Francesca made a face and smashed her hat back on her head. \u201cI\u2019ve said what I needed. If you want to stay with that monster, far be it from me to try and stop you further.\u201d She tipped up her chin and sailed out of the room.</p><p>The front door slammed behind her.</p><p>Daisy turned to Sebastian, uncrossing her arms and holding the towel loaded with ice up to his cheek. \u201cHere, this will help a little.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian stared down at her, his eyes smoldering. \u201cIvan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa, Mr. Romanov?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the maid still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa. She\u2019s cleaning the upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian slid his gaze to Ivan. \u201cHave her pack up Ms. Barnes things.\u201d</p><p>Ivan left the room, cast iron skillet in hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Daisy said, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not staying here a minute longer.\u201d He stepped away from her and crossed his arms, tattoo-covered muscles flexing.</p><p>Apprehension skittered over her, making her stomach drop. \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me here anymore?\u201d Daisy asked.</p><p>Hell, no, Sebastian didn\u2019t want her here, in this house, not when it had been tainted with Vladimir\u2019s sins. His mother\u2019s accusations and revelations. He was ready to burn the damned fainting couch.</p><p>He was ready to burn down the entire house.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He watched the emotions play across her face, leaving devastation behind. He\u2019d caused her pain. Honestly, his mother wasn\u2019t that far off the mark with her assessment of him. He needed to get Daisy as far away from him as possible, before he really hurt her.</p><p>\u201cBut you promised we\u2019d get through this together,\u201d she said, her hazel eyes turning shiny with tears.</p><p>\u201cI promise a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. You\u2019re better than him...you\u2019re not the man she claims you are, and you always keep your promises to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Listening to the confidence in her voice, he almost believed her. Yet another reason to terminate their contract and get the hell away from her. He should never have contacted her in the first place. He should never have listened to his cousin\u2019s open window speech.</p><p>\u201cRomanov\u2019s take. Romanov\u2019s conquer. They want and get.\u201d He slashed a hand through the air. \u201cDid I not say those very words to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut you apologized. Would your dad have apologized?\u201d</p> <p>No, but it didn\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things. \u201cI only apologized for my words, not my deeds.\u201d He turned away from her, moving to the window and looking out.</p><p>\u201cQuit trying to push me away.\u201d She placed a hand on his shoulder and he tensed. \u201cYou\u2019re a better man than he is, and you\u2019ll be a better dad, too.\u201d</p><p>Christ. He\u2019d nearly forgotten about the baby. Yet another reason why he should support Daisy financially and leave her and their child the hell alone. They\u2019d be better off without him. \u201cWhen Vladimir had a stroke, I put him in a hospital that would sooner kill him than heal him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, he had it coming. I don\u2019t feel bad about saying it either since he got out of that place and died in an accident on a yacht with a female friend.\u201d</p><p>He let his forehead fall to the windowpane. \u201cI tried to destroy my brother\u2019s career by letting pictures of him snorting coke go viral on the Internet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis bad decisions, his bad consequences. Besides, you took the blame for him. That\u2019s a great big brother. Looks like their situations were more about results than your evil plans,\u201d she said, her tone on this side of teasing. She was trying, God love her, to make the situation not as bad as it was. As it had always been.</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault Vladimir and his mistress were murdered, because I refused to honor past deals with certain entities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Those world domination fellows mean business.\u201d She snorted. \u201cGuess horse heads are too seventies, huh?\u201d</p><p>Was there nothing he could say that would make her not be on his side? \u201cBloody fucking hell, Daisy, would you be serious?\u201d He whirled around, intent on shaking some sense into her. Instead, he froze at the sight of tears on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, but I can\u2019t.\u201d She shrugged, more tears falling. Her lashes were black and spiky, mascara running at the corners of her eyes. In her hand, she still held the towel that she had gotten for his cheek.</p><p>Because she cared about him. No, because she loved him.</p> <p>In the space of a heartbeat, he held his arms open and she threw herself into them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love.\u201d He tucked her against him, stroking her back. \u201cI need some time...a few hours to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfterward, I\u2019ll come to you at The Hall. We\u2019ll spend the night there and decide what to do later.\u201d He already knew what to do. The money she needed had already been transferred to her bank account, and all that was left was the Board\u2019s vote, but he wouldn\u2019t wait that long. The sooner she was back to her old life, the better.</p><p>Leaning back in his arms, she tipped up her chin. \u201cCan we sleep in the bedroom that isn\u2019t haunted by the ghost of the bride who stabbed herself in the heart after finding her husband doing the maid?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look of disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s the story they\u2019re telling now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone in my tour group ate it up. So I told the one about the ghost who haunted the well that my Aunt Jeannie and her sons use to make moonshine. The Feds won\u2019t go near that place. Except once, but that was during the day.\u201d</p><p>Oh, his giddy aunt. Where the hell had Ivan been? \u201cYou went on a tour, by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ivan was there. You know, he has a really hard time blending in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t pay him to blend in,\u201d he said, fighting the urge to smile. \u201cI pay him to keep us, you especially, safe.\u201d</p><p>A teasing light entered her eyes. \u201cFrom all the other world dictators who get mad when you out dictator them?\u201d</p><p>He guessed it wasn\u2019t the end of the world if she thought his dad had been a regular bloke. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to wait to eat dinner, until you come home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat without me.\u201d</p><p>Those teasing eyes of hers narrowed. \u201cBut you will come home tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise, and you know how I feel about promises made to you,\u201d he said with a playful wink. However, on the inside, all that resided was pain, betrayal, and old memories he had been forced to relive.</p><p>He managed to keep himself in check while the maid helped Daisy pack her things by organizing his art supplies. Though after tonight, he\u2019d never touch them again. Painting was something his mother had taught him to do when he\u2019d been little. But now he suspected she had taught him to do it so he\u2019d leave her alone.</p><p>While Christian had been the talkative actor, Sebastian had been the quiet one. The one who\u2019d rather stay with his mum than venture out to meet new people. Even then she had pushed him away, preferring his brother over him.</p><p>The pencil he\u2019d been holding snapped in two. He threw it away with the rubbish.</p><p>Daisy rushed in the room, bringing her vanilla and honey scent with her. One last kiss goodbye and she was gone. He waited until the gates closed, before he pulled out his phone.</p><p>Text me when you get to the Hall safely.-S</p><p>Which bedroom? ~D</p><p>A grim smile fit his lips. Mine.-S</p><p>Slipping his phone into the back pocket of his jeans, he strode to the lounger.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>It was almost ten by the time Sebastian showed up, hair mussed, scratches on his arms, and smelling of smoke.</p><p>Daisy sat up in bed, her heart beating like hummingbird wings. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He stalked to the bed and picked her up. \u201cI need a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still dressed,\u201d she pointed out. She wanted to talk to him. The entire time he\u2019d been gone, she\u2019d worried. And all that worrying had led to four fingernails bitten to the quick, a burnt pot of soup, and bleach on her favorite shirt.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re nude.\u201d</p><p>She clung to him as he strode to the bathroom and turned on the lights. The shower here was even more impressive than the one at The Rectory. He smacked the wall. Water poured from the interior of the shower and steam filled the air.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>She gazed into his eyes. \u201cYou have me.\u201d</p><p>Stepping inside the shower, clothes and all, he pressed her against the wall and covered her mouth with his, tongue forcing its way inside. \u201cI want to do things to you.\u201d He bit her lip hard, then soothed the sting with a little kiss and let her legs slid to the marble floor. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d like it. Hell, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve ever done what I have in mind.\u201d</p><p>She trembled at the raw lust and darkness in his words. She couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand over his face and groaned. \u201cDammit, Daisy. That\u2019s not what you should say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve only been with one man besides you and he only liked certain things, certain ways, so I\u2019m all up for things I haven\u2019t done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. I should\u2019ve beaten your ex\u2019s arse when I had the chance. Selfish bastard.\u201d Water sluiced down his body, plastering his shirt to his skin. His gaze fixed on her. A gaze so full of despair that she simply hugged him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Bastian.\u201d</p><p>For long minutes, he stood there, his body stiff and his arms at his sides. Slowly, his arms lifted, wrapping around her and holding her tight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to witness that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for her.\u201d</p><p>Unwrapping her arms from around his waist, she helped him peel off his clothes, and then she washed him. Gently scrubbing at the dirt, the smell of smoke on his skin, and the cuts.</p><p>He leaned against the wall and let her, making grunts of appreciation when she ran her hands over his thighs and calves. When she was done, she led him out of the shower and handed him a towel. Then she dried herself off, but he lifted her in his arms before she could dry the ends of her hair.</p><p>Without saying a word, he took her to the large couch by the bay window and laid her down on it, then left her, only to return a few seconds later with a box. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of doing this,\u201d he said as he adorned her with jewelry. A diamond necklace with emeralds around her neck, a string of pearls around her stomach, and dark rubies for her wrists. \u201cMy countess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need jewels,\u201d she said and he raised a brow. \u201cOkay, so jewelry makes this girl happy, but really all I want right now, at this very moment, is you.</p><p>He joined her, touching her reverently, like she was made of glass. Like she\u2019d shatter at his touch, only she knew the truth. She\u2019d shatter if he stopped.</p><p>Sebastian didn\u2019t stop. He kissed her passionately, made her moan as he used his hands to bring her to heights she thought unattainable. There wasn\u2019t a place on her body he didn\u2019t leave untouched.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered in her ear. Then he kissed his way down her body, pausing at her stomach. \u201cAnd I love you, too. No matter what happens.\u201d Another kiss and he fixed his gaze on her, a tender smile on his sexy mouth.</p><p>Tears fell onto her cheeks. He stretched out beside her, touching her face and he kissing the tears away. \u201cWhy are you so sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it feels like you\u2019re trying to tell me good-bye,\u201d she said.</p><p>Instead of relieving her fears or even addressing them, he turned her on her side and entered her slowly, cupping a breast and telling her how good she felt, how beautiful she was. \u201cThere will never be another woman for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m all yours forever.\u201d She pushed her hips back and he lifted her leg up, going deeper. \u201cNo piercing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be too careful with you,\u201d Sebastian said, kissing her neck as he let her words wash over him. All his forever. If only that were possible.</p><p>Pulling out of her, he rolled Daisy to her back and slowly pushed inside of her. She made a noise of pleasure in her throat. \u201cI love looking at you, your body.\u201d He gazed down at the jewelry he had given her, though she didn\u2019t know it now belonged to her. \u201cYour sweet smile.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, and in that smile was the world he wanted.</p><p>It was a world he couldn\u2019t have. But he could have this. He could have this last night with her.</p><p>He dipped his head, capturing a hard nipple in his mouth. He sucked, bit, and tongued her there as his hips moved, as he plunged in and out of her wet heat.</p><p>Tomorrow morning, everything would end between them. Tomorrow morning, he might not ever come back from what he had to do to her.</p><p>She gripped his back, her nails biting into him, and he thought of nothing but her. Nothing but right now, while he was inside of her, and while she loved him. She loved him. Yes, she\u2019d seen the best of him, but she\u2019d also seen the worst.</p><p>Yet she still loved him.</p><p>\u201cHarder.\u201d He had to be marked by her. He had to have some piece of her stay with him. \u201cMark me. Carve your name into my skin.\u201d It was already permanently carved into his heart.</p><p>A slight hesitation and she flexed her fingers, raking her nails down his back. Just like that, he was ready to come. He slipped a hand between them and stroked her swollen clitoris. Her mouth formed a perfect O and she blinked up at him. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>He surged inside of her, desperate for her, and came endlessly while she stroked his back and whispered how much she loved the feel of him, how good he made her feel. How he was perfect for her in every way.</p><p>His body shuddered and trembled. He was powerless in her arms.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said softly, and his heart nearly beat out of his chest. \u201cTear up the stupid contract, because I want to be with you without it. Let\u2019s get married and have lots of babies,\u201d\u2014A shy smile graced her lips. \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re already ahead of the curve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She ran her fingers through his hair. \u201cAll those emails and texts were love letters, before everything went bad, weren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were. They are.\u201d He leaned into her touch. \u201cEvery time I sent you a text or an email, it was another way of saying I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve loved you for a while now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He exhaled, defeated and overjoyed all at once. \u201cI\u2019ll tear up the stupid contact tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Sighing happily, she snuggled against him, the remaining jewelry cold against his skin, almost as cold as he would have to be tomorrow. \u201cBastian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have so many unhappy tattoos, you know, after the one your dad gave you?\u201d</p><p>Well, that was certainly one way of describing them. \u201cEach one represents something horrible done to my brother, my mother, and my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she replied, her expression thoughtful. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sitting up, he got to his feet and held out his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get into bed. The couch isn\u2019t a proper place for you to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you sleep with me?\u201d Her dark gaze searched his face.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Not until after he said those words did she take his hand and allow him to put her to bed. He crawled in beside her and pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cSomeday will you get a happy tattoo, for me?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d do anything for her, but his someday was filled with endless nights without her. \u201cWhat would you suggest?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA cupcake.\u201d</p><p>Grunting, he rolled his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be an evil looking cupcake, with a skull and crossbones on it, if that would make you feel better. All the other world domination guys would want one, I bet, when you showed it off at y\u2019all\u2019s next plotting-to-take-the-world-over meeting. Is there food at those things? I could make you a really evil lunch to take.\u201d She giggled at her own joke.</p> <p>He clenched his jaw. Yet another reminder of what he\u2019d be losing once he sent her away. Her view of him and his world. Her acceptance of his life and all that had been done to him and his brother, without treating him differently or with pity.</p><p>\u201cCan you take me to Scotland tomorrow? Ivan said you have a few houses there that you let families stay in to keep them safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you this?\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, all at once mysterious and playful. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one that has ways of making people talk.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, she was truly frightening and completely perfect for him. Maybe he should be selfish and keep her with him after all.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Sebastian adjusted his tie and turned his attention to the woman he loved lying in his bed as she ate breakfast. Breakfast he\u2019d served her this morning.</p><p>He\u2019d waited as long as he could, as long as he would allow himself to be selfish, but in the end his love for her and his sense of duty to do right by her won out. \u201cI\u2019m sending you back to Holland Springs today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Daisy choked out.</p><p>He fiddled with his cufflinks, then shrugged into his suit jacket and buttoned it like it was his only defense against her look of disbelief and horror. \u201cThe Board voted last night. I\u2019m back in as President. Your services are no longer needed as the requirements of the contract have been filled.\u201d</p><p>She threw her napkin down. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p> <p>Walking to his dresser, he grabbed the iPad and handed it to her, watching as she read the article. Watching as her face went pale, then red and then pale again.</p><p>It gutted him completely. He was empty inside and now he wouldn\u2019t have her love to fill up the space.</p><p>The article confirmed everything he had said. The Board had voted, citing a major deal with a Hong Kong based company, as the major swaying point. Not once was his engagement to her mentioned. It was as if she didn\u2019t exist. Oh, except for the last line about him being repeatedly seen in the company of an American girl, the cousin of his brother\u2019s wife.</p><p>Cruel, harsh, to the point, and utter rubbish.</p><p>\u201cYou never really needed me at all,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d He took the iPad away and set it on the dresser again. \u201cI\u2019ve a meeting in Madrid this afternoon at five. You\u2019ll need to be at Heathrow by one. I\u2019ve arranged for Ivan to take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go with you. I said I could stay longer and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sat down on the bed beside her, longing to touch her. \u201cThere were conditions placed on the vote. One: that I agreed to never attempt to dismantle the company again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to break things off with you and pursue Kate once more, for the connections her family has in Germany.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck just as she began to chew on the inside of her cheek. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cWhat about tearing up the stupid contract? What about\u2014\u201d Her mouth snapped shut.</p><p>Getting married and having lots of babies, he finished saying in his mind. \u201cI think with all of the heightened emotions surrounding the pregnancy, my mother\u2019s appearance, and this entire fake fianc\u00e9e idea, that perhaps we let our emotions get out of hand.</p><p>Her face flushed as her eyebrows raised, but she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cYou get to keep the money we agreed to, since I\u2019m the one in breach.\u201d He tried to give her some cheeky smile, but he couldn\u2019t, not when it felt like he was carving his heart into pieces. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be too hard to manage, without me, eh? You\u2019ll go back to your life, without the Earl of Obnoxiousness at your side, and I\u2019ll go on with mine.\u201d</p><p>Turning her head, she stared across the room, at the beautiful view from his window. The gorgeous estate lake glittered in the morning sun. In the middle sat a small island with a stone gazebo. There was a small dock to the right of it. He would have liked to have taken her there, had a picnic, and made love to her under the sun.</p><p>\u201cDaisy, are you okay?\u201d he asked and she turned her attention back to him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I am not okay. I am the exact opposite of okay.\u201d She chewed harder on her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken everything from me: my best friend and the man I love\u2014just like Glen. Just like every man I\u2019ve dared to love.\u201d</p><p>He had. He was exactly like that ass, but he could justify his actions to himself because it was for her good, not his. There was nothing good in sending the woman he loved away. There was nothing good in sending the woman who made him smile and accepted him for who he was away.</p><p>It was madness. He was mad. He was dying inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the baby?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my lawyers draw up a contract for us that spells out visitation and child support. Of course, the child will live with you the majority of the time. It should live with its mother. Don\u2019t you agree? \u201cThe child. Not our child. Not our baby. It. How heartless he sounded. Well, he had learned from the best.</p><p>\u201cYay for more contracts.\u201d She smiled bitterly. \u201cAlthough, I totally agree with this one.\u201d</p><p>He drew back, golden brows bunching together. That was not the answer he expected, although he knew he deserved it. Perhaps he thought she would fight harder and call his bluff. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You, Kate, and Romanov Industries deserve each other. I bet that m\u00e9nage thing y\u2019all will have going on will make headlines.\u201d She picked up her fork and speared an asparagus. \u201cSince we\u2019re all about confessions this morning, I have one of my own. I got an email from my lawyer this morning while you were downstairs. Turns out, I don\u2019t need your money after all. The insurance company made a mistake. I\u2019ll have the money reversed to your account.\u201d</p><p>She was the worst liar he\u2019d ever met. Not meeting her eyes, he glanced around the room. \u201cYou could keep it, for a stake in your venture with Isabella. I\u2019ve never owned a part of a catering business before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no desire for any part of me to be owned by you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will allow me to pay child support,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you want to be in our child\u2019s life\u2014a paycheck?\u201d</p><p>Hell no, but their child deserved better than him for a father. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I want. It\u2019s what\u2019s best for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Romanov Industries,\u201d he quickly added. He stood and placed his hands behind his back. \u201cI\u2019ll be off. Thank you for letting me be a small part of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d she cried as he began to stride away. \u201cThe only thing you have to say to me, before you walk out, is thank you?\u201d</p><p>He paused at the door, his hand going to the frame. His knuckles whitened and his head bowed. \u201cThe jewelry from last night is yours to keep, all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your damn jewelry,\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours anyway. Perhaps...perhaps we\u2019ll see each other at the wedding and of course, when the baby is born. If you want me there, that is,\u201d he said, and then he left the room, the door shutting softly behind him.</p><p>He knuckled an eye, the lump in his throat suffocating. He couldn\u2019t catch his breath. Closing his eyes, he made himself take a breath. And another. Then a third before he finally could see straight and actually walk out the house and out of Daisy\u2019s life for good.</p><p>The fork Daisy had been holding clattered to the tray. The same tray that he\u2019d placed across her lap this morning, bringing breakfast to her with a smile and a kiss. He\u2019d helped her out of all the jewelry she\u2019d slept in and placed it back in the wooden box, then headed to the shower.</p><p>Like a fool, she\u2019d sat in bed, eating breakfast and exhaling dreamy sighs about him between bites.</p><p>She flexed her fingers, pain shooting through the joints. Her heart pinched so hard in her chest that she gasped and rubbed the heel of her other hand against it.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she fell against the pillows and tried to make sense of it all. But she couldn\u2019t. Eventually the pain ebbed and the sun rose higher in the sky. She set the tray aside and rose from the bed, shoving her arms into his robe and cinching the sash tight, as if it was all that held her together. Which wasn\u2019t far from the truth.</p><p>A maid came to her room and began to pack. Daisy kindly but firmly told her in no uncertain terms that the box of jewelry had to stay here as well as the contents.</p><p>Ivan appeared at the door. \u201cWe need to leave in twenty minutes, Countess.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the word and glanced down at her ring. It shone bright in the sun, a reminder of her time with him. Of when he had thought of her and had tried to be more than what he was. In the end, he\u2019d been right\u2014business mattered more to him than anything else.</p><p>Twisting the ring off her finger, she placed it on the dresser and gave Ivan a wobbly smile. \u201cPlease, call me Daisy.\u201d</p><p>It took her only fifteen minutes to shower and dress. She sat in the back of a dark Mercedes as it wound its way down a perfectly maintained drive. Ivan turned on the main thoroughfare, the car picking up speed. As they got closer to his house, the urge to stop and take a keepsake of her fairy tale time there overwhelmed her. Though in nine months she\u2019d have a permanent keepsake of their time together.</p><p>\u201cIvan, do we have enough time for a quick stop at The Rectory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa, Coun\u2014Daisy.\u201d He grimaced in the rearview mirror. \u201cHe\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see him,\u201d she said, meeting gaze. \u201cWill you stop, please?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he slowed near the entrance and turned into the drive. The gate opened and the car pulled through. Ivan stopped near the front entrance and Daisy got out. For a moment, she leaned against the car and took everything in. The leafy vines climbing up the front, the profusion of flowers that bloomed everywhere. The front door with its heart-shaped knocker.</p><p>For a little while, this had been their home. Tears slipped down her cheeks. For a little while, she had deluded herself.</p><p>She started for the door, surprised to find it unlocked.</p><p>Looking back at Ivan, she asked, \u201cIs it safe for me to go in?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once.</p><p>Opening the door, she stepped inside and slapped her hand over her mouth. It had been destroyed. Holes the size of a man\u2019s fist peppered the drywall. Furniture lay in shambles, pieces and parts strewn everywhere. A sledgehammer lay propped against the stairwell.</p><p>\u201cIvan,\u201d she shouted, finally finding her voice.</p><p>He came running through the door, his heavy footsteps echoing. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Romanov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did this?\u201d She carefully made her way to the kitchen, but it remained pristine. Nothing out of place, not even the towel she\u2019d left by the sink. The pot of African Violets remained where they\u2019d been, to the right of the sink, where Sebastian liked them. Automatically, she moved them to the center, where she preferred them.</p><p>\u201cAfter you left. He ordered us out, but Boris remained behind.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did. Ivan had to protect her.</p><p>She wandered through the rest of the house, her heart sinking with each step, each room worse than the one before it. She saved the art studio for last. Despite thinking that her heart couldn\u2019t get any lower, it dropped to her feet.</p><p>His studio looked as if a bomb had gone off in it. All of his paintings had been slashed, paints dumped, and the fainting couch\u2014oh God\u2014the fainting couch sat outside, its charred remains a violent gash against the gorgeous garden.</p><p>She whimpered, letting her head hit the glass with a soft thud. She pressed her palm against the pane. So many painful memories had overshadowed the new ones they\u2019d created. Or maybe those were false memories.</p><p>Maybe the entire thing had been a dream.</p><p>Or a beautiful nightmare.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Daisy had been home all of six days when her lawyer had contacted her about a serious buyer for her business. They wanted to purchase the rights to The Sweet Spot and operate a bakery in Charlotte.</p><p>She met Isabella for lunch at the park to discuss the offer. The two of them sat on a wrought iron bench, sharing a sandwich and cold pasta salad.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should take the deal?\u201d Daisy asked after catching her best friend up on everything.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to own a bookstore,\u201d Isabella said. \u201cNothing I used to want to do appeals to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re pitiful right now,\u201d Daisy replied.</p><p>\u201cAt least we\u2019re pretty,\u201d Isabella joked.</p><p>Daisy said nothing for a moment, and Isabella gave her a what-are-you-hiding-from-me look. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Isabella\u2019s tawny eyes widened. \u201cOh God,\u201d she croaked. \u201cWhat can I do? What do you need?\u201d</p><p>Daisy laced her fingers with her best friend of seventeen years and said, \u201cI need a friend.\u201d Then she collapsed against her shoulder and sobbed while Isabella held her.</p><p>\u201cI will always be your friend, no matter what,\u201d Isabella said after Daisy had cried herself out. \u201cI love you like a sister.\u201d</p><p>Daisy smiled. At least she still had that. No one could buy her best friend\u2019s love.</p><p>\u201cYou did the right thing, Ms. Barnes,\u201d her lawyer said, adding it to the stack of papers she\u2019d already read over. \u201cNow you\u2019re debt free.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBusiness free, too,\u201d she pointed out, but she refused to be bitter about it. This was the best she could do, without Sebastian\u2019s money, and the insurance company had agreed to reduce the outstanding bill to an even two hundred grand.</p><p>Lucky for her, the buyer had given her enough to pay off the insurance bills and the few outstanding bills she had due to vendors.</p><p>Other than that, all she had left was ten grand in savings. It was enough to keep her head above water, until her catering business took off again. This time without a storefront. Instead, she\u2019d be conducting business out of her apartment.</p> <p>Guess she was getting back to her roots, like her momma had done for so many years. And just like her mother, she\u2019d be raising a child by herself too.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all we need. I\u2019ll have what\u2019s leftover of the check deposited into your account.\u201d Her lawyer stood, extending his hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She rose and shook it, then walked out of his office.</p><p>The spring day was bright and cloudless, birds chirping happily as she made her way to her car. A strange feeling of someone watching her washed over, and she glanced quickly to her right, but no one was there.</p><p>Shaking her head, she unlocked her car and got in. Her mind was really playing tricks on her. While her heart...her heart refused to listen to her mind. Her heart continued to love Sebastian Romanov. Her heart was clearly an idiot that needed therapy.</p> <p>And she needed to cook something, for about a million people, to feel better about how things ended between them.</p><p>With a sigh, she started up her engine and headed home.</p><p>Sebastian glanced down at his notes, then back at the Board. \u201cOur second quarter earnings rose by three percent, outpacing predictions and shoring up holdings. Consumer confidence rose as well, stock in Romanov Industries is currently selling on the American Exchange at Eighty-five and a half.\u201d He took a drink of water and waited for their reaction, bored out of his mind.</p><p>Liam sat on his right. \u201cBrilliant work,\u201d he said, and the six other members nodded their heads in unison. \u201cOn schedule for next month\u2019s meeting\u2014we will take a vote on reinstating Mr. Romanov as President. Any further questions?\u201d</p><p>A chorus of no\u2019s and after two rounds of back patting and handshaking, the Board left the room. Liam closed the door behind the last one and loosened his tie. \u201cDrinks. I\u2019m thinking seven-thirty, at Percy\u2019s new place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one on St. James that doesn\u2019t have an entrance?\u201d Sebastian asked, clearing his app of notes. Two weeks. It had been two weeks since he\u2019d seen Daisy, since he\u2019d talked to her, since he\u2019d texted her. Since he\u2019d been inside of her.</p> <p>He swallowed.</p><p>No use in thinking of her. Just this morning she had signed the child support agreement and had emailed it back to him, with no other communication included in the reply.</p><p>He\u2019d done what was best for Daisy, for the baby too. Even if he had had to lie in order to send her away. Even if he was the most miserable he\u2019d ever been in his life. Nothing appealed to him. Most nights he stayed in his townhouse, locked in his room, vodka his only company.</p><p>Ivan barely spoke to him and Boris, who never said a word, glowered more than usual.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Sebastian,\u201d Liam said, snapping his fingers in front of Sebastian\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cAre you in or out? I\u2019m leaving for Monaco this evening at eleven.\u201d He wriggled his brows. \u201cPlan on surprising Verity with this trip. Strictly business, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He slipped his phone into his coat pocket and followed Liam into the hallway. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there, outside. But if I can\u2019t find the entrance, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Liam punched him in the arm. \u201cText me when you get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d Sebastian said with a curt bow.</p><p>\u201cNone of that here.\u201d Liam pulled a face. \u201cI\u2019m plain Mr. Stewart and you\u2019re my employer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get back to work before I fire your arse, Mr. Stewart.\u201d</p><p>Liam saluted him. \u201cMuch better.\u201d He strode away, hands finding his pockets.</p><p>Sebastian opened the door to his office, intent on pouring himself a cuppa, when he noticed it was already occupied.</p><p>\u201cChristian?\u201d</p><p>His brother stood at the window, still in his coat. \u201cThe wedding\u2019s been moved up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Sebastian moved to his desk, clicking on his calendar. \u201cWhen? I\u2019ll adjust my schedule\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s gaze slid to his brother\u2019s face. It was pale. \u201cYou\u2019re not happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared as hell.\u201d Christian plopped down in the nearest chair and ran a hand over his face. \u201cMe, someone\u2019s father? You know I\u2019ll screw it up somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met our parents.\u201d Christian steepled his hands together, pressing them against his mouth. \u201cWe are destined to mess up our children. It\u2019s in our DNA.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian closed the calendar and came from around the desk to sit in the chair opposite his twin. A part of him still couldn\u2019t believe that Christian needed him of all people. He\u2019d chosen to seek him out. It had to mean something. He hoped like hell that it meant something. \u201cIt\u2019s in every parent\u2019s DNA to mess up.\u201d</p><p>His twin gave him a skeptical look. \u201cLevels, Bastian, levels. I\u2019m predicting mine to be at DefCon One.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian leaned forward in his chair. \u201cJust the fact you\u2019re worried means you\u2019ll be a better father than the one we had. Just the fact you\u2019re faithful to your wife and put her above everything means you\u2019ve already given the finger to Vladimir\u2019s legacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit,\u201d Christian said, letting his hands fall from his face.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for making an effort to reassure my brother,\u201d Sebastian snapped.</p><p>\u201cReassure me? More like lie to me.\u201d Christian\u2019s jaw worked. \u201cYou think you\u2019re just like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you have reminded me often over the years, so do you,\u201d Sebastian said, his hands automatically fisting. \u201cCan we ever have a civil conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we can\u2014as soon as you\u2019re willing to be honest.\u201d The color had returned to his twin\u2019s cheeks and for that, Sebastian was thankful. He hated to see Christian in pain\u2014emotional or physical.</p><p>Sebastian flicked his hands out. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your word that no matter what, you\u2019ll be completely truthful.\u201d</p><p>Jaw flexing, Sebastian bit out, \u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Christian grinned, and then his face turned serious. \u201cDid you really only set out to repair our relationship in order to become President again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian exhaled. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to fix things between us for years now, but my pride wouldn\u2019t allow it. The whole improve-your-image scheme was the excuse I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn your pride,\u201d Christian said with a shake of his head. \u201cAnd damn mine as well. Final question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest not to overwhelm you.\u201d</p><p>A sort of odd tension left Sebastian\u2019s heart, replaced by the burgeoning relationship with his brother. \u201cGo on then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a two-part question.\u201d Christian flashed a smile. \u201cThe first part\u2014do you love Daisy Barnes?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian stared at him. Love, not loved. Or even were you in love.</p><p>\u201cRemember: The Truth will set you free,\u201d Christian added.</p><p>\u201cYes, I love Daisy,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cGood job,\u201d Christian said softly. \u201cThe second part\u2014why in the hell did you send her away?\u201d</p><p>Glancing down at his hands, Sebastian sorted through his lists of reasons why he\u2019d sent her away from him, then, \u201cBecause I thought Francesca was right about me. I thought Daisy deserved better than some bloke who couldn\u2019t put her before everything else in his life. Not even when it counted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou listened to our egg donor?\u201d Christian snapped and Sebastian jerked up his head. \u201cShe\u2019s a self-righteous witch who\u2019s been playing the poor-pitiful-me act for years. Once a month Zoe gets a phone call from the woman and talks to her for hours, because I refuse to give Francesca the time of day. She made her decision, Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a woman who suffered through an abusive marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that gives her the right to be abusive to you how?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian shook his head, trying to make his twin understand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t but she loves you, though. Maybe you should see her. She wants to have a relationship with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. She\u2019s low on cash, since Vladimir died and left her out of his will. The duke refuses to give her anymore than her weekly stipend, despite her claims that he cut her off years ago.\u201d Christian stretched out his legs. \u201cBesides, any relationship that comes with strings attached, isn\u2019t the kind I\u2019m interested in having. I\u2019ve got all the family I need.\u201d He tilted his head to one side and bit his lip. \u201cWell, my family will grow a bit in about six months, but you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t the time to tell his brother that he wouldn\u2019t be far behind in expanding his own. Instead, Sebastian cleared his throat. \u201cAm I a part of that family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked, you bloody git, if I knew,\u201d Sebastian grumbled.</p><p>His brother stood, holding out his arms. \u201cCome give us a hug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the hugging type.\u201d But he stood anyway and kind of lurched toward his brother.</p><p>\u201cLuckily for you I am.\u201d Then Christian grabbed him and nearly squeezed his internal organs out of his body. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you as well,\u201d Sebastian said softly, his voice breaking over the last word.</p><p>Christian stepped back, releasing him from his hold. \u201cNow, about Daisy. You will be at the wedding, yes? It\u2019s actually next weekend. Will that be a problem?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian straightened his tie, adjusted his cuff links, and smoothed his jacket before answering. He needed every extra second he could get to compose himself, before he blurted everything to his brother. \u201cOf course it\u2019s not a problem. I\u2019ve best man duties, but I\u2019m not sure if Daisy can forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do plan on trying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought question and answer time were over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I bloody plan on trying and winning.\u201d Sebastian flashed an easy grin, though on the inside he wasn\u2019t quite so confident. \u201cI\u2019m a Romanov, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...about that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>Christian held thumb and forefinger out, almost pressing them together. \u201cJust a little.\u201d He clapped Sebastian on the back. \u201cNo worries though. I shall assist you in wooing your lady back into your arms.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian made a face. \u201cThink I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d His twin shrugged. \u201cSee you on Thursday? You\u2019re welcome to stay with us. Although, I think my mother-in-law is making Zoe move out until after the ceremony, for good luck or something that goes along with weddings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d Christian strode to the door, calling out over his shoulder, \u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on a minute,\u201d Sebastian said and Christian paused. \u201cZoe isn\u2019t pregnant, is she? This was some big scheme of yours to...to...\u201d He didn\u2019t know what exactly, but his brother was an actor\u2014a brilliant one at that\u2014and had gone from scared shitless to overconfident arse in a matter of minutes.</p><p>\u201cTo make things right with my brother?\u201d Christian asked.</p><p>\u201cAh-ha! Wait...what?\u201d Sebastian asked.</p><p>His brother rolled his eyes. \u201cShe is pregnant and I did need someone to talk to. Who better than my big brother? See you next Thursday.\u201d With that, Christian opened the door and strolled out, leaving Sebastian standing there, staring after him.</p><p>He stared at the door, long after it closed. This was it, his opportunity to make everything right with all the people he loved.</p><p>His phone buzzed. A text from Liam.</p><p>Mark your calendar full for next week. We\u2019ve meetings lasting into the weekend with Chen Software. Seal this deal and you\u2019re in.</p><p>This account was even bigger than the last. Bowing out of negotiations, even for family, would be looked upon unfavorably. Romanov Industries needed him to get this account.</p><p>There were no guarantees that his new relationship with his brother would last. Hell, by next week, they could be at each other\u2019s throats and ready for blood.</p><p>As for Daisy, that was an even longer shot at success. He\u2019d hurt her\u2014really, really hurt her\u2014with his thoughtful lies. With the manufactured webpage he\u2019d built. With the bit about Kate. With everything.</p><p>Every night he made himself relive their last conversation and the shattered look on her face. How it was drawn tight with pain. Her full lips trembling when he\u2019d rejected everything she had to offer, including their child, by firmly placing himself in the absentee father role</p><p>He wanted to be more than that. He wanted everything life had to offer him. And his everything in life was Daisy and their unborn baby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rubbing the back of his neck, he briefly closed his eyes. He\u2019d be lucky if she even looked his way at the wedding, much less spoke to him. Yet another relationship with no guarantees.</p><p>But if he closed the deal with Chen, then he was guaranteed to get his old position back. His old life back, his old everything back.</p><p>Where\u2019s your sense of adventure? He heard Daisy whisper in his mind.</p> <p>His phone buzzed again. Another text from Liam, confirming dates and times. Sebastian\u2019s thumbs hovered over the keyboard for a heartbeat, and then he texted him back.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve outdone yourself, Daisy,\u201d her aunt Leah exclaimed, floating by her with a dreamy smile. \u201cI swear, sugar, your momma would be so proud.\u201d</p><p>Daisy smiled and thanked her, heading to the kitchen with an empty tray. She knew Leah wasn\u2019t expecting a response, not really. She was too caught up in the wedding, but who could blame her? The ceremony had been something out of a fairy tale.</p><p>The reception had been a huge success. She\u2019d given out more business cards in the past hour than she had in all the years she\u2019d been doing business. A quick glance at her email on her phone confirmed that at least a dozen guests had already contacted her about their events.</p> <p>Business-wise, she couldn\u2019t ask for more.</p><p>Personal life-wise, she was an emotionally wreck. All she had done for the past month was cry and watch stupid movies about people who fell in love.</p><p>She\u2019d had doctor appointments, lawyer appointments, more doctor appointments...she\u2019d been probed, blood draw, weighed, and measured. Yesterday she\u2019d heard the heartbeat of the baby, seen it wiggle and move on the screen. All she could think about was that Sebastian should have been there to share the moment with her, and not Haven, who\u2019d let her cry for hours on her shoulder after the appointment.</p><p>All she could think about was she was as alone now as she ever was, but in about six months, she\u2019d be very busy and very not alone. In another week, she\u2019d be three months pregnant. In another three weeks, she\u2019d be able to find out if she were having a little boy or girl.</p><p>The only thing that had gotten her through it all had been the support of Isabella and Haven, and the sudden rush of having to come up with Zoe and Christian\u2019s menu\u2014two months ahead of schedule.</p><p>At least Zoe and Christian had decided to hold the wedding at their house, in their beautiful backyard. A genius move if anyone asked her. They could totally control almost everything, including who was allowed inside the festivities.</p> <p>\u201cMust be nice,\u201d Daisy muttered.</p><p>If she had had her way, there would be one guest that wouldn\u2019t be eating her food. Oh no. And he certainly wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to stand beside his brother, looking like a fairy tale prince come to life in his tux. Right down to the sun shining on his golden hair and the boutonniere pinned to his jacket that was the exact shade of his eyes. She\u2019d been able to steal a few minutes to watch the ceremony, but he hadn\u2019t even notice her. Not that she would know what to do if he had.</p><p>Most likely she would have done something dumb, like run up to him and kiss him, then punch him in the gut for being the earl of Asshatland.</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay?\u201d Isabella asked, intercepting her at the back door to the house. \u201cNot overdoing yourself? Are you drinking enough water?\u201d She looked stunning, wearing a blue and orange chevron printed dress with orange heels. Vacationing in the islands had been good for her, though Daisy knew her best friend wasn\u2019t over what her ex had done to her. Not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks for checking on me.\u201d</p><p>Tawny eyes narrowed and she handed Daisy a glass of water, crossing her arms and tapping her foot until Daisy had no choice but to drink it.</p><p>\u201cThere. Anything else, Dr. Edwards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you to sit down for more than five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant, not dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait until the morning sickness starts.\u201d</p><p>It already had. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve experienced it how many times?\u201d</p><p>Isabella rolled her eyes and then smiled. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll stop being so pushy, but are you sure you\u2019re okay\u2014emotionally, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, but what can I do about pregnancy hormones?\u201d Daisy asked with a little wink. She gave her friend a quick hug. \u201cGo on and have fun. The band\u2019s really good\u2014some guy named Jaxon Hunter is the lead singer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm. I will, but if you need me for back up...\u201d Isabella words trailed away as Sebastian\u2019s best friend walked by. Liam looked back, his dark gaze raking over Isabella before heading to the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam Stewart, best friend of my baby\u2019s daddy.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment shone in Isabella\u2019s eyes before she frowned. \u201cOh, never mind, then.\u201d</p><p>Daisy grinned, the first one that had felt real all day. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be disloyal of you to dance with the man, if you want. I heard from Zoe that his fianc\u00e9e left him for another man. So...you two have a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d Isabella replied, but Daisy noticed her gaze didn\u2019t stray from Liam\u2019s retreating form.</p><p>Sebastian looked their way and caught her gaze. The air electrified. Daisy\u2019s hand automatically went to her stomach and he frowned, then began to stride in her direction.</p><p>Oh God, not now. \u201cI need to go inside, to take a little break, okay?\u201d Daisy whispered and Isabella nodded.</p><p>\u201cMake it a long break.\u201d</p><p>Only pride and everyone watching kept Daisy\u2019s steps measured. Once inside the house, she placed the tray on the island in the middle of the kitchen and bent over it, head falling in her hands. There were no noises beyond the sound of the band outside.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t followed her. Disappointment rose, sharp and painful as it tried to hollow her out. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>For the rest of the afternoon, she kept her heart strong and tears at bay. She laughed, smiled, and urged the wedding guests to eat their fill. When it was over, she joined everyone else as they threw rose petals and blew bubbles at the couple.</p><p>Unable to stop herself, she searched the crowd for him. Maybe...there were no maybes, no wishful thinking that somehow they\u2019d work it out.</p><p>Sebastian had made his choice, and it hadn\u2019t included her. Despite wanting to check on him, on his new life, she had forbidden herself to look at Internet sites that featured stories about him. It was for the best, really, because there was no way she could handle seeing him with Kate.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here, baby girl,\u201d Haven said, giving her a hug. \u201cYour earl left about forty-five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach dropped. So much for wishful thinking she\u2019d told herself not to think about. \u201cHe\u2019s not my anything, and I\u2019m not looking for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s silver eyes narrowed, effectively cutting Daisy off. \u201cYou are, and you know what\u2014that\u2019s okay with me.\u201d</p><p>Daisy chewed on the inside of her cheek as they walked to the back of the house. She directed the clean-up crew while Haven shot murderous glares at Heath. He merely smiled and toasted them, then made a face at the couple\u2014Isabella and Liam\u2014 still on the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cOver her my tail,\u201d Haven muttered.</p><p>\u201cSebastian doesn\u2019t want me, just like Glen,\u201d Daisy finally said.</p><p>Haven turned her attention to Daisy. \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>A soft snort escaped her. \u201cYou got that right: I\u2019m wrong for both of them.\u201d</p><p>Pushing her pink bangs out of her eyes, Haven pursed her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re exactly what you are and it\u2019s exactly the friend I\u2019ve always needed.\u201d</p><p>Warmth spread through her heart and tears gathered. Though she and Haven hadn\u2019t always been the closest of friends, like Daisy was with Isabella, she valued and loved her to pieces. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home? I\u2019ll take care of everything else for you.\u201d</p><p>Normally, Daisy would have declined the offer. But normally, Daisy wasn\u2019t emotionally and physically drained. \u201cI think I will. There\u2019s a hot bubble bath calling my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not too hot,\u201d Haven warned.</p><p>Daisy shot her a look. \u201cNot you, too.\u201d But she didn\u2019t mean it. She was grateful for her friends. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>It took less than twenty minutes to drive back to her apartment, another two to trudge across the parking lot and up the stairs. She unlocked her door and went inside, only to smell food.</p><p>Brow creasing, she sniffed. It smelled like roast beef and carrots and potatoes, but she hadn\u2019t cooked roast. And she sure as heck didn\u2019t remember leaving the lights on. Maybe she had pregnancy nose and memory.</p><p>Her stomach rumbled as she walked further inside and then froze, her jaw dropping to the floor.</p><p>The table in the corner was set for two, with her china and food she knew she hadn\u2019t cooked. In the center of the table sat a very familiar looking pot of African Violets.</p><p>\u201cHullo, Daisy,\u201d a deep, sexy voice she recognized said, and she spun around, only to find her earl standing there.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and rubbed the back of his neck. His shirtsleeves were rolled up and his tie was half-undone. \u201cThought I\u2019d make you dinner.\u201d</p><p>Oh my mercy. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d Her stomach rumbled again.</p><p>Sebastian gave her midsection a pointed look. \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat at the reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I watched you the entire time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you care so much, right?\u201d She swept past him, ready to leave the apartment and go to Haven\u2019s.</p><p>He caught her by the elbow, his grip gentle but firm. \u201cI do care. You look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll day morning sickness tends to make me less than pretty,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cAll day.\u201d Concern lit his blue eyes. \u201cHave you spoken to a physician about this?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t decide whether to be mad at him or cave and weep in his arms. \u201cLook, we have nothing to say to each other, and I\u2019m taking care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you need someone to take care of you,\u201d he said, pulling her toward the table and gesturing at the food. \u201cWeren\u2019t you the one to say grumpy equals hungry?\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched despite her best effort. \u201cYes.\u201d He pulled out her chair and sat down, then began to serve her. Everything looked cooked to perfection. The beef medium, the carrots just this side of squishy and the potatoes soft enough to be pierced by a fork.</p><p>Ravenous, she took a bite before he sat down across from her and almost moaned her appreciation. It tasted perfect.</p><p>\u201cFull disclosure: I did not make this meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmpf,\u201d she said, mouth full of carrots.</p><p>\u201cI had G.R. flown in and he cooked this meal for you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>A faint smile lifted his sexy mouth at the corners. \u201cI couldn\u2019t very well subject you to my cooking.\u201d</p><p>They ate in silence, mostly because she was hungry and didn\u2019t actually want to talk to him, because she might say something stupid like stay with me forever. Then he would laugh at her and leave. Only why go to all the trouble?</p><p>She grimaced, glancing up at him.</p><p>His fork clattered to the table. \u201cIs it the baby? Shall I take you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>It hit her, then, right in the heart. Sebastian only wanted to check on the baby, not her. \u201cThe baby\u2019s fine. You saw the ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>He visibly swallowed. \u201cThank you for sending me the picture, but it\u2019s not enough. I want more. I want you and the baby with me every day.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her chin, her eyes widening. \u201cYou want what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a miserable sod without you.\u201d Sebastian got up from his chair, rounded the table and kneeled beside her, gently stoked the side of her face. \u201cI miss you, Daisy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou didn\u2019t speak to me all day.\u201d</p><p>All through the ceremony and reception, he\u2019d been unable to take his eyes off her. When Daisy had finally sat down to enjoy the ceremony, her face luminous and her smile wistful, he\u2019d stared for so long and hard that he\u2019d nearly forgotten to give Christian the ring.</p><p>\u201cYou had me all tongue-tied.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAs a man in love would be in your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Kate and Romanov Industries?\u201d she asked, shooting to her feet and stumbling back. Her face had turned pale and her hands trembled, as she fumbled for the bar stool behind her.</p><p>Fear raced through him. All this way to see her and because he blurted out his feelings, she would fall and hurt herself. \u201cCareful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to sit down again,\u201d she said, her voice reedy thin.</p><p>Standing, he crossed the small distance between them, scooped her up in his arms. He walked to the bed, then climbed on top of the mattress and settled her against him, stealing a hand up the front of her cardigan to touch her belly. \u201cThere is no me and Kate, or even Romanov Industries. I wasn\u2019t voted in as president and there were no conditions in the first place,\u201d he said, silently cheering as her body relaxed against him. She had to believe him, or she\u2019d still be stiff as a board. \u201cI made the entire thing up so you\u2019d be forced to leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the news on the website?\u201d Her brows drew together. \u201cIt looked real when you gave me the iPad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaid a bloke a lot of money to create it,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I deserved you, and for damn sure you didn\u2019t deserve to put up with someone like me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut that was for me to decide, not you,\u201d she said shakily. \u201cHow can I be sure you won\u2019t do that to me again?\u201d</p><p>Again? Hope beat in his chest. \u201cYou can\u2019t be sure. I can only promise not to, and you\u2019ll have to decide if I\u2019m worthy of your trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just stop saying all the right things.\u201d Tears pricked her eyes and her lower lip trembled as she looked up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not being fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is that, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my stupid pregnancy hormones want me to forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Hope beat in his chest. He lightly caressed her stomach. \u201cDoes your very smart pregnancy hormones want me to keep holding you like this?\u201d</p><p>Her head dropped back on his shoulder. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He tipped her chin up and gently placed a kiss on her lush mouth. \u201cTo kiss you like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Daisy.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cDecide I\u2019m worthy of your trust, and I\u2019ll hold and kiss you like this forever.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a shaky breath, the tip of one finger tracing the top of his hand. \u201cI saw The Rectory...and the fainting couch the day I you sent me away, or what was left of it.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks heated. \u201cI was furious. My father had tainted the only place I\u2019d thought was mine. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you should have talked to me. You should have trusted and believed me, even after you decided to tear the place apart.\u201d Her pretty hazel eyes fixed on him. \u201cWhy on earth didn\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t trust myself, not after listening to\u2014it all boiled down to I loved you enough to let you go and find someone who was a billion times better than me. Someone different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetter than you?\u201d Her body trembled and his heart broke into pieces. \u201cI never needed you to be different. I never wanted you to change. The man I fell in love with went to work with all the other world domination guys. Only my earl of world domination is a good guy where it counts. He just didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me, Daisy.\u201d He pulled her ring out of his pocket and held it between them. \u201cBe my countess. I\u2019ll take you and the baby to every tourist trap, in every country in the world that doesn\u2019t involve heights.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want the world, Sebastian. You\u2019re more than enough. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He slid the ring on her finger and captured her lips with his, leaving him breathless when she finally broke their kiss. Cupping her face with his hands, he said, \u201cSo I bought this shop, called The Sweet Spot, and I need a manager. Know anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the buyer was James Franklin,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cListed him as the contact on the contract. He\u2019s the attorney who handles things stateside for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou really bought my store? Anything else you\u2019re keeping from me, earl of sneaky things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no longer in the running to be President of Romanov Industries. Ever. I gave it all up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He bit the side of his lip. \u201cIt means that I am completely at your service, until you no longer require me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no world domination stuff anymore?\u201d She actually looked a little let down, and he had to grin.</p><p>\u201cOnly the majority shareholder now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of a long holiday. Perhaps a trip around the world, with you.\u201d He raised his brows. \u201cBut if you\u2019re too busy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we start at Alnwick Castle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny Harry Potter movie landmark you wish.\u201d He kissed her nose. \u201cWherever, whenever, however. My time belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sebastian Romanov.\u201d</p><p>He dipped his head and kissed her again, slowly, like they had all the time in the world to rediscover each other\u2014which they did. He grinned at her. \u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>A baby\u2019s cry woke Daisy out of a dead sleep. Before she could move, Sebastian joined her, their son cradled in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI changed his nappy. He\u2019s better now,\u201d he said. \u201cAren\u2019t you, my fine lad?\u201d</p><p>Rhys Westmoreland Romanov, the future Earl of Spenserfield and all of three months old, cooed at his dad. The baby was the spitting image of his father, right down to his pale blue eyes that showed no signs of changing colors. Her momma would have been proud, especially since they\u2019d name Rhys after Daisy\u2019s dad.</p><p>She smiled at the two of them, her heart bursting with love.</p><p>Rhys began to cry again.</p><p>Sebastian gently bounced their son, but the baby wouldn\u2019t stop fussing. \u201cI think he\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot wait for Rhys to meet his baby cousins and his Auntie Bella,\u201d she said, taking the baby from his father. Rhys began to nurse as soon as she put him to her breast.</p><p>Christian and his family as well as Alexander and his were due to arrive this afternoon, then Isabella was coming the day after that. Everyone was staying two weeks.</p><p>Sebastian was outwardly tolerant while she was outwardly ecstatic, yet she knew he was as happy as she. Slowly but surely, he and Christian were repairing the years of damage to their relationship. It wasn\u2019t perfect by any means, but they were trying and that\u2019s what counted.</p><p>Maybe being separated by an ocean helped when things got too tense between the brothers.</p><p>Living in England hadn\u2019t been the easiest decision to make, no matter how much she loved Sebastian. He would have lived in Holland Springs, if she\u2019d asked him, but she hadn\u2019t. She wanted to be free to travel and enjoy life without the responsibilities of running a business. So he\u2019d taken her everywhere while she could travel, and when the time had come, they\u2019d returned to Hawkfell Hall to live in the newly renovated groundskeeper cottage situated on the opposite side of the lake, away from the hustle and bustle of The Hall, and set to making it the home of their dreams.</p><p>She was as happy and content as the baby in her arms. Kissing his sweet little head, she murmured nonsense words at him.</p><p>\u201cLucky,\u201d Sebastian murmured, stroking the baby\u2019s cheek, and then he turned his attention to her. \u201cAre you happy here?\u201d</p><p>He asked her that at least once a day, always worried she\u2019d given up too much to be with him, but she hadn\u2019t given up anything. In her mind, she\u2019d gained the world.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d She leaned against him as he settled down beside her in the bed. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSitting in this very bed, in this very house, with you and our child, was number three on my new and improved Bucket List.\u201d</p><p>New and improved Bucket List? \u201cWhat was number one and two?\u201d</p><p>Placing a knee on the side of the bed, he cupped her face and gazed into to her eyes. \u201cWin back the woman I love and convince her to marry me.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been sitting in bed, she would have swooned. \u201cAnd number four?\u201d</p><p>Kissing the tip of her nose, he grinned. \u201cWho needs a number four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really happy, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beyond happy.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic.\u201d</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>\u201cGobsmacked.\u201d He kissed her cheek.</p><p>She rolled her eyes playfully.</p><p>He kissed her lips. \u201cBlessed.\u201d</p><p>Her heart turned over in her chest. \u201cWe both are,\u201d she said, and then she kissed him back with all the love and hope she felt for their future in it. </p> </body></html>"]
