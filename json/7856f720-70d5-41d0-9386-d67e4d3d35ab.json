They were already sitting down in a booth when we arrived. The waitress showed us to our seats, and Ellery stood there, looking at the booth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to fit in there.\u201d She frowned.</p> <p>Ellery was big, and she looked like she was going to give birth any day.</p><p>\u201cElle, I\u2019m sorry. I should have requested a table. I don\u2019t want you squishing my goddaughter.\u201d Peyton laughed.</p><p>I called the waitress over and told her we needed a table. She accommodated us immediately. We sat down, and I asked Ellery if she was okay. She looked at me as we both started laughing about her not being able to fit in the booth.</p><p>\u201cI better lose all this weight,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to the gym together, and I\u2019ll hire you a personal trainer,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Peyton grabbed Henry\u2019s hand and told us they had an announcement. She held out her left hand and showed off her exquisite engagement ring. Ellery wanted to jump up and hug her, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cPeyton, it\u2019s gorgeous! Congratulations!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>I got up from my seat, kissed Peyton on the cheek, and shook Henry\u2019s hand. \u201cCongratulations to both of you, and may you have a wonderful life together,\u201d I toasted as we all held up our glasses of wine, with the exception of Ellery; she had water. Ellery turned to me and gave me a look as if she was trying to figure something out.</p><p>\u201cYou knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew Henry was going to ask Peyton to marry him, and you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d She glared.</p> <p>I smiled and that was enough to let her know that I knew. \u201cOf course I knew. Who do you think went with him to pick out the ring?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWow, Connor, how could you not tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because it was a surprise, and I know you. You would\u2019ve called Peyton and told her about the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you would\u2019ve, and then you would\u2019ve told her to act surprised,\u201d I said as I kissed her cheek.</p><p>Peyton looked at Ellery. \u201cHe\u2019s right; you probably would\u2019ve,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know, I would\u2019ve,\u201d she said as she rolled her eyes.</p><p>The waitress brought our meals to the table. I looked over at Ellery, but she wasn\u2019t eating like she normally did. She was picking at her chicken. \u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, honey. I\u2019m just not very hungry.\u201d She smiled as she turned to me.</p><p>Henry and I talked about sports as Peyton and Ellery threw around some ideas for the wedding. We had a nice dinner, and we were in the company of great friends. I couldn\u2019t ask for a better evening. I ordered us another round of drinks and dessert for everyone. The waitress had been flirting with me and Henry all night. She brought the desserts to the table and brushed up against me with her br**sts.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Peyton said. \u201cI saw what you just did, and don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed what you\u2019ve been doing all night. That man right there, that you just boob-brushed, is married with a baby on the way, and this man right here is my fianc\u00e9. If his wife wasn\u2019t about to give birth, she would have kicked your ass by now. So back off our men, and go find someone who isn\u2019t already taken.\u201d The waitress glared at her and then looked at Ellery.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what she said,\u201d Ellery spat.</p><p>The waitress turned and walked away in a huff. Henry took Peyton\u2019s hand and started laughing. Ellery put her hand on my leg under the table and squeezed it. I looked over at her as she stared at me.</p><p>\u201cConnor, my water just broke; it\u2019s time,\u201d she said.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Ellery</p><p>Connor stared at me as if he didn\u2019t understand what I\u2019d just told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMy water broke, Connor. The baby\u2019s coming. We need to get to the hospital,\u201d I said as slowly as I could.</p><p>He jumped up out of his chair and helped me out of mine as he looked at Henry and Peyton.</p><p>\u201cHer water broke. It\u2019s time!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>Peyton quickly got up from her seat and ran over to me, while Henry remained calm.</p><p>\u201cOMG! It\u2019s time! Henry, what do we do?\u201d Peyton asked in a panic.</p><p>\u201cEveryone relax,\u201d he said. \u201cEllery, are you having any pain yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. Let\u2019s get in my car, and we\u2019ll get you over to the hospital.\u201d Henry smiled.</p><p>Connor put his arm around me as he guided me out of the restaurant. Before we made it to Henry\u2019s car, I abruptly stopped and doubled over in pain.</p><p>\u201cHOLY SHIT!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Connor stopped with me and put his hands on my stomach.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. Breathe in and out, like we learned in our class.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head and did what Connor said as the pain started to subside. Henry and Peyton told us to wait while they pulled the car up. When Henry drove up to the curb, Connor opened the door for me, and I slid in the back seat. He shut the door and walked around to the other side. Connor climbed in, sat beside me, and pulled out his phone to call Denny. After he hung up, he reached over and pulled me into him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe our daughter is coming,\u201d he said as he kissed my head.</p><p>I buried my face into Connor\u2019s neck as another contraction started. The pain was unbearable; it was worse than my cancer treatments, and I didn\u2019t think that could be possible. Connor held my hand and kept telling me to breathe. I swore I was going to lose it if he said it one more time. Peyton kept turning around and looking at me from the front seat.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Elle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m all right, Peyton?\u201d I said with gritted teeth.</p><p>It seemed like it took forever to get to the hospital. Once we arrived at the ER, Henry got a wheelchair, and Connor helped me from the car. I had only had a couple of contractions, and I was already wishing this was over. Connor wheeled me inside, and Henry led us up to the Labor and Delivery unit. Stopping at the unit desk, Henry gave them my name as the clerk showed us to my room. She handed me a cloth gown and said a nurse would be in shortly.</p><p>I changed into the cloth gown that was all too familiar to me. Connor helped me as Peyton and Henry stepped out of the room. I could feel another contraction coming, and I bit my bottom lip as tears started to fill my eyes. A nurse walked into the room and looked at me and Connor. It was Nurse Bailey. She looked at me with a smile as she walked over and patted my hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, sweetie.\u201d She smiled. She turned and looked at Connor. \u201cAre you still the friend?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Connor grinned, as he replied, \u201cNo; I\u2019m the husband.\u201d</p><p>Nurse Bailey smiled and nodded her head. \u201cVery good. I\u2019m glad to see things worked out for the two of you. I knew they would.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to me as she hooked me up to the fetal monitor. \u201cLook at you! You\u2019re having a baby.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I tried to smile back, but another contraction was starting. I bit down on my bottom lip as Connor grabbed my hand. Peyton and Henry walked back into the room, and Peyton rushed to my side.</p><p>\u201cI paged your doctor, Ellery, but I haven\u2019t heard anything yet,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your doctor, sweetie?\u201d Nurse Bailey asked.</p><p>\u201cDr. Keller!\u201d I yelled through the pain.</p><p>\u201cDr. Keller had a family emergency yesterday and had to leave town for a few days. His partner, Dr. Reed, is taking care of his patients. I\u2019ll go call him,\u201d she said as she patted my hand and left the room.</p><p>The contraction ended, and I felt like I could breathe again. Connor sat on the edge of the bed and softly kissed my lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>Henry walked over and explained to us how the fetal monitor worked. He showed us at which point a contraction was starting, when it was at its peak, and when it was ending. Connor looked intrigued as he studied it. Peyton and Henry left the room to grab some coffee and to bring me back some ice chips.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe Nurse Bailey is my nurse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, I can\u2019t believe it. But I\u2019m glad she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cLook at our daughter\u2019s heartbeat,\u201d Connor said as he pointed to the number on the fetal monitor.</p><p>I smiled as I looked over at it and another contraction began. I grabbed Connor\u2019s arm and dug my nails into his skin. Did I feel bad? No, the pain of my nails is nothing compared to the pain of childbirth.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, baby.\u201d He smiled at me as he stroked my forehead.</p><p>Peyton and Henry walked into the room with a cup of ice chips. She took one out and started rubbing it across my lips.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this will help you feel better,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s going to help me feel better is getting this baby out of me!\u201d</p><p>Nurse Bailey walked in and said she needed to examine me. Henry and Peyton stepped out of the room again while Connor sat on the edge of the bed next to me, holding my hand. She explained that she needed to see how much I was dilated. When she finished, she looked at me and pursed her lips.</p><p>\u201cHmm, you\u2019re only dilated to one centimeter. You said your water broke while you were at the restaurant, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was sitting down at the restaurant when it broke,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Nurse Bailey looked directly at Connor. \u201cYou didn\u2019t by chance have sex today, did you?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Connor, and he looked at me. \u201cThis is your fault!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMy fault? You\u2019re the one who invited me to take a shower with you before we left for the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust relax, Ellery. Everything will be fine. I don\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d she said as she walked out of the room.</p><p>A few hours passed, and I wasn\u2019t any further along. The contractions were getting worse, and Nurse Bailey stepped out of the room to call Dr. Reed. Henry was keeping a close eye on the fetal monitor, as was Connor.</p><p>I was lying on my side, and Connor wiped my forehead with a cool cloth. A contraction had just ended. I let out a deep breath and closed my eyes. I felt Connor kiss me softly on the forehead as he pushed back my hair.</p><p>\u201cGet ready, Elle. Here comes another contraction,\u201d he said as he stared at the monitor.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to tell me, Connor?!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be prepared so you can start your breathing. I don\u2019t want you to be caught off-guard.\u201d</p><p>Every bit of me wanted to kill him at that moment. The pain with each contraction was intensifying, and I felt like my body was trying to rip itself in two. As always, he was right and another contraction came.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Elle. Come on, baby; deep breaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, I think you better lay off; she\u2019s getting pissed,\u201d Peyton said.</p><p>I started screaming in pain. I promised myself that I wasn\u2019t going to be one of those women, but at that moment, I didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t care who heard me, and I didn\u2019t care what they thought. Connor was still telling me to breathe, and that was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me to breathe one more time, and I swear I\u2019ll castrate you, Connor Black!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>I heard Peyton burst into laughter, and Connor looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWow, Elle. That was uncalled for,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo! What\u2019s uncalled for is you making me feel worse than I already do. I don\u2019t want to know when another contraction is coming! I don\u2019t want you to tell me to breathe! I know you\u2019re trying to help me, but all I need from you, babe, is silence.\u201d</p> <p>Connor stared at me and took my face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t, Connor. It just hurts so badly, and I want it to be over,\u201d I said as I interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cI know you do, and I can\u2019t wait to see our daughter. She\u2019s going to be beautiful, just like her mother.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>A tear fell from the corner of my eye and down my cheek as another contraction started; the worse one yet. I looked over at Henry.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Henry, give me an epidural. Please, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEllery, I can\u2019t. You\u2019re not dilated yet. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said as he shook his head.</p><p>I wanted to die. This baby was tearing me apart inside, and something didn\u2019t feel right. Nurse Bailey walked in and told Henry that Dr. Reed asked her to call him when I was dilated to five centimeters. Connor sighed, got up from the bed, and walked over to Henry.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer is she going to be like this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cEvery woman is different, Connor. It\u2019s hard to tell. She\u2019s not even dilated to three yet. This could go on for another twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>Peyton took my hand and started rubbing it softly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Elle. We\u2019re here to help you through this.\u201d</p> <p>Connor turned and looked at me. He tilted his head and gave me a small smile as he walked over and sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cIf I could have this baby for you, I would. I hate seeing you in so much pain,\u201d he said as he grabbed my hand and brought it to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Connor,\u201d I whispered as I closed my eyes and braced myself for the next contraction.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Connor</p><p>Seeing Ellery in pain like that was killing me. My heart ached for her with every scream she let out and every tear that fell from her eyes. I called my mom, dad, and Cassidy to let them know that Ellery had gone into labor. They stopped in the room for a few minutes to talk to her and then took seats out in the waiting room. Ellery and I had discussed that we didn\u2019t want anyone else in the room during the delivery. Peyton had a hard time with our decision at first, but then understood. As Peyton and Ellery talked in between contractions, Henry asked me to step out into the hall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry, but Ellery isn\u2019t dilating like she should be. I\u2019m getting concerned because her water broke, and I don\u2019t want to risk an infection setting in. I think we need to let her get up and do some walking around to try and get her dilated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me not to worry, but you\u2019re worried about an infection,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Dr. Reed and ask him what he advises,\u201d he said as he put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m watching her and the baby very carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for keeping me posted, Henry.\u201d I sighed as I walked back into the room.</p><p>Ellery was lying on her side, panting and trying to breathe through another contraction as she squeezed Peyton\u2019s hand. I walked over to her, sat on the edge of the bed, and grabbed her other hand.</p><p>\u201cEllery, look at me. I need you to focus on me, not the pain.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head and looked at me as her pain continued to spin out of control.</p><p>\u201cOur daughter is killing me, Connor. She\u2019s going to KILL me!\u201d she screamed as the contraction came to an end.</p><p>Ellery closed her eyes. I took the cloth from the table and gently wiped her forehead with it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. I\u2019m here with you, and I\u2019ll get you through this. We\u2019ve been through so much, and this is nothing.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open as if Satan himself took over. \u201cNothing! Did you just say this is nothing?!\u201d she yelled at me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh oh, I think someone\u2019s in deep shit. If I were you, I\u2019d get the hell out of here, and run as fast as you can.\u201d Peyton laughed.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say anything right. Everything I said was wrong and just pissed Ellery off. I got up from the bed and pulled my phone from my pocket. After I had an idea that might help keep Ellery calm, I called up Claire and asked her if she could bring Ellery\u2019s classical music CD and the small painting of the baby cuddled up in the moon amongst the stars. I would stand in the doorway of the nursery, late at night, and watch Ellery as she stared at that painting while rubbing her belly. One night, I asked her about it.</p><p>\u201cThis is the fifth night you\u2019ve been in here staring at that painting.\u201d I smiled as I walked into the nursery and placed my hands on her shoulders.</p><p>She reached her hand up and placed her hand on top of mine. \u201cI feel serene when I look at it. I\u2019m not quite sure why, but I do. So, whenever I start to feel nervous or anxious, I come in here, and it calms me down.\u201d</p><p>As I hung up with Claire, I walked over to Ellery and kissed her on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cClaire is on her way with something that I think will help you relax.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and tried to smile, but another contraction was starting. I sat down on the edge of the bed and let her squeeze my hand as tightly as she needed to. I was in awe of this beautiful woman that I called my wife and what she was going through to give me a child. When the contraction ended, she brought my hand up to her lips and kissed it softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, babe. I know I\u2019m hurting you,\u201d she said.</p><p>I gripped her face lightly with my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re not hurting me, Ellery. I love you, and I love what you\u2019re doing for us. You do what you need to in order to get through your contractions. I\u2019m here for you, baby.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Ellery</p><p>I lay there and stared into my husband\u2019s eyes as he tried so hard to make me comfortable. Peyton was sitting in the chair next to the bed and she looked exhausted.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go find Henry and grab something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you. You\u2019re going to need me.\u201d She smiled as she took my hand.</p><p>Connor looked over at her. \u201cPeyton, I love you, but I\u2019m her husband and the only person she needs right now.\u201d</p><p>Peyton knitted her eyebrows at him. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right, but I want to be here for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are here for her, and I appreciate it, but you really should take a break,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cYou and Henry should go have sex in one of the rooms,\u201d I said as I gave her hand a squeeze.</p><p>A smile brightened her face. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, Elle, but don\u2019t go and have that baby until I get back!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>As Peyton walked out of the room, Claire walked in. Another contraction had started just as she set my favorite painting on the chair next to me.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d I started to scream.</p><p>As Connor looked over at me, he instantly grabbed my hand, and I bit down on my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cLook at the painting, baby. Focus on the painting, not the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Connor. The pain is too horrible. I can\u2019t concentrate on anything but the pain!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Claire grabbed the cloth from the stand and wiped my forehead. \u201cI remember the pain, Ellery. Just remember what the end result of that pain is.\u201d She smiled as she pressed her lips to my forehead.</p><p>As I smiled at her and slowly closed my eyes, Connor got up and walked her out of the room. I heard him in the hallway, thanking her for bringing the CD and the painting. Nurse Bailey came back into the room and told me she had to check me again to see how far I was dilated. She sighed after she finished checking me, and Connor walked back into the room.</p><p>\u201cAny progress?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. She hasn\u2019t dilated at all. I need to call the doctor. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Connor as he leaned over and kissed my head. \u201cI\u2019m scared something\u2019s wrong,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. Everything\u2019s going to be fine. I just think our daughter\u2019s stubborn. She\u2019s starting to remind me of someone.\u201d He smiled as he ran his hand down my cheek.</p><p>Just as I was beginning to relax, another contraction started. Connor looked at the fetal monitor.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be having another contraction already? It\u2019s only been a few seconds since the last one.\u201d</p><p>The pain was different this time. It was more intense and radiated throughout my entire back. The pressure was so bad that I had to push.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I have to push. I have to!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ellery. I don\u2019t think you can do that yet.\u201d</p><p>He held onto my hand as the sweat dripped from my face, and I screamed in pain. Henry, Peyton, and Nurse Bailey ran into the room. As I looked at Nurse Bailey, Peyton came over and took a hold of my other hand.</p><p>\u201cI have to push. I have to. Please help me,\u201d I begged as the tears streamed down my face.</p><p>\u201cEllery, you can\u2019t push,\u201d Nurse Bailey said as she looked at Henry.</p><p>Suddenly, the monitor started beeping and all eyes went to it. Henry stood there and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHer blood pressure\u2019s dropping and so is the baby\u2019s heart rate. We need to get this baby out now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Dr. Reed and he said he\u2019s on his way, but he said it\u2019ll take at least thirty to forty-five minutes for him to reach the hospital,\u201d Nurse Baily said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit how long it\u2019s going to take him. Go make sure an operating room is available, and page an anesthesiologist, STAT!\u201d</p><p>The voices around the room were getting deeper and slower. The room started to spin as Henry clasped my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cEllery, stay with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>I wanted to give up. I couldn\u2019t do this anymore, and I couldn\u2019t stand the pain. My body was tired, and I could feel myself slowly drifting away. Suddenly, I heard Connor\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cBaby, don\u2019t you dare give up. You better not give up on me. We\u2019ve come too far, and we fought too hard to have our life together, and you will not give up! Do you understand me!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Suddenly, a group of people came running into the room and transferred me to another bed. I looked at Connor as I opened my eyes and the tears began to fall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I love you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Another doctor came from behind and put a mask over my face. \u201cI need you to take in a deep breath, Ellery. This will help you to relax.\u201d</p><p>With the mask on my face, I looked over at Peyton and saw that she was crying. They started to wheel me out of the room, but I wouldn\u2019t let go of Connor\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby, I\u2019ll be right there. I promise you that I\u2019ll be there with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 4</p><p>Connor</p><p>I followed them out of the room and stood there as they wheeled Ellery down the hall. I was scared shitless and worried. If something happened to them, I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. I would never forget the look on Ellery\u2019s face as they wheeled her away from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make sure that Ellery and the baby are fine,\u201d Henry said as he put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cGet changed and I\u2019ll see you in operating room.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded my head as Ellery disappeared from my sight. Nurse Bailey handed me a pair of light blue scrubs and told me to change in the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be all right, Mr. Black. Now hurry up and put those on.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>As I walked into the bathroom to change, Peyton went to the waiting room and sat with my family. I quickly changed, and when I opened the bathroom door, Nurse Bailey was standing there, holding a mask in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou need to put this on before we go into the room. It\u2019s for the baby\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><p>As I took the mask from her, she led me down the hallway to the operating room where Ellery was. She told me to wait outside the double doors while she went to make sure they were ready. A few moments later, she walked through the doors and motioned for me to follow her. When she led me into the sterile room, Ellery turned her head and looked at me. Immediately, she held out her hand. I smiled as I walked over to her, gently took her hand, and sat on the stool next to her.</p> <p>\u201cHi.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cHi back,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ellery, let\u2019s have this baby,\u201d Henry said as he started making the incision.</p><p>As she stared into my eyes, I leaned over and lightly rubbed her forehead with my thumb.</p><p>\u201cI remember the first time I stared into your beautiful eyes.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cIn your kitchen, after you accused me of breaking your rule.\u201d She smiled back.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll never forget the feeling that overtook me the moment you turned around and looked at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were an ass,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know you did, and I was, but you changed me, Ellery. You swooped in, broke all my rules, and completely turned my life around.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the cries of a baby jolted us back into reality. Ellery and I looked at Henry as he held our daughter up. \u201cCongratulations, Mom and Dad.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>She was screaming as she moved her little arms and legs around. Henry handed her to the nurse, who took her over and cleaned her up.</p><p>\u201cYou did so good, baby. I\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d I whispered as I kissed her.</p><p>\u201cYou look very sexy in that mask and those scrubs.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was random.\u201d I smiled back.</p> <p>I got up and walked over to where my daughter was being cleaned up. The nurse wrapped her in a pink blanket and handed her to me. I was incredibly nervous to hold her, but it was what I\u2019d been dreaming of since the day Ellery told me she was pregnant.</p><p>\u201cEllery, I\u2019m going to start stitching you up now and, when I\u2019m done, then you can hold your baby,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Henry, for everything.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>As I walked over to Ellery\u2019s side, she held out her hand. I sat down on the stool and brought our daughter closer to her so she could touch her. At this point, she had stopped crying, and she could barely keep her eyes open. She wrapped her delicate little hand around Ellery\u2019s finger. I watched as a tear fell from her eye.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful, Connor,\u201d Ellery said.</p><p>\u201cOf course she is. She\u2019s your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Ellery reached her hand up and softly stroked my cheek. I\u2019d never felt this kind of feeling before. I loved Ellery so much that my entire existence revolved around her. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to love her or anyone else even more. Looking down at my baby girl, seeing the love of my life in this child, and knowing that we both created this miracle, made my love grow even more for both of them.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you about something,\u201d I said as I looked at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI know we talked about a couple of different names for her, but I think we should name her after your mom, Julia.\u201d</p><p>Ellery stared at me for a moment as tears sprang to her eyes. \u201cI love it, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she should have a name that\u2019s a part of all of us. I would like to name her Julia Rose Black.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Ellery</p><p>\u201cI love that name.\u201d I smiled. \u201cJulia Rose Black is a beautiful name, and I think it fits her perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Connor leaned over and kissed my lips. Seeing him sitting there and holding Julia was one of the happiest moments of my life. Anyone who looked at him could see and feel the love he had for that child.</p><p>\u201cAll stitched up, Ellery,\u201d Henry said. \u201cIf you want, you can hold Julia now.\u201d</p><p>Connor looked at me and smiled as he put Julia in my arms.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling great.\u201d I smiled as I kissed Julia\u2019s forehead.</p><p>Henry cleaned up and walked over to me and Connor. \u201cCongratulations, you two,\u201d he said as he kissed my head and shook Connor\u2019s hand.</p><p>The nurse wheeled me out of the operating room and back into my room. I couldn\u2019t believe that our daughter was here. It seemed like only yesterday that I found out I was pregnant. Once I was back in the room and settled in bed, Connor left to go tell our family and friends that Julia had arrived. As she was sleeping in my arms, Peyton walked into the room and instantly covered her mouth with her hands.</p><p>\u201cEllery, she\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said as she walked over and kissed Julia on the head.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she? I just can\u2019t believe she\u2019s here.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Connor walked into the room with his mom, dad, Cassidy, and Denny following behind.</p><p>\u201cLet me see my beautiful granddaughter,\u201d Jenny said with a tear in her eye.</p><p>As much as I didn\u2019t want to let Julia go, I handed her over to Connor\u2019s mom. Denny walked over and sat on the edge of the bed. He took my hand and gently kissed it.</p><p>\u201cYou and Connor have made one beautiful little girl.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day that Connor would become a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest with you, I never thought I would see this day myself,\u201d I said as I looked down.</p><p>\u201cWell, you fought, you won, and now you\u2019ve been rewarded. I can\u2019t think of two other people who deserve this more than you and Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI love you, Denny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Elle.\u201d He smiled as he kissed me on the forehead.</p><p>When Nurse Bailey walked into the room, she announced that it was time for everyone to leave. She took Julia from Jenny and handed her to me, as it was time for my lesson in breastfeeding.</p><p>I walked through the elevator doors to the penthouse. It felt good to be home. The past couple of days in the hospital were uncomfortable and starting to drive me crazy. Connor followed behind me with Julia, and Claire and Denny emerged from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, Ellery,\u201d Claire said as she gave me a light hug.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Claire.\u201d</p><p>The aroma of apple pie filled the air of the penthouse and it smelled wonderful. \u201cAre you making apple pie?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am, and just for you.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>Connor looked at me and then at Claire. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can have some too, Connor,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Connor asked Denny if he could hold the car seat while he helped me up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby. Do you want me to carry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can walk. But thank you for offering.\u201d I smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know what that smile does to me, Elle.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and helped me up the stairs. We reached the bedroom, and I immediately lay down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed this bed.\u201d</p><p>Denny brought Julia up to the room and set the car seat down on the floor. \u201cWelcome home, you three.\u201d He smiled and then walked out of the room.</p><p>As Connor climbed on the bed and lay next to me, we both stared at Julia, who was sound asleep.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s perfect, like you,\u201d he whispered as he softly kissed my neck.</p><p>I smiled and closed my eyes as his lips traveled to the edge of my ear.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to make love to you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cEspecially now that I\u2019m not pregnant anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved making love to you while you were pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Julia started to cry. We looked at each other and smiled. Connor got up and carefully took her from her car seat. I took off my shirt as he gently handed her to me and she latched onto my breast.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more beautiful than seeing you feed our daughter,\u201d he said as he sat down on the bed next to me and kissed me on the lips.</p><p>This was my family\u2014the three of us\u2014and I didn\u2019t want anything more.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Connor</p><p>Six weeks later</p><p>Life was getting back to normal, as much as it could, with a baby in the house. Ellery had trouble breast-feeding after the first week, so we ended up bottle-feeding Julia, which made it easier for me to help out with the feedings. I tried to hire a nanny, but Ellery wanted nothing to do with it and said that she didn\u2019t want a stranger raising our child. I worked from home as much as I could, but I had reached a point when I had to start going into the office.</p><p>I was sitting at my desk, going over some paperwork, when a text message came through from Ellery.</p><p>\u201cYou better be home early tonight. I just left the doctor\u2019s office, and I\u2019ve been cleared to have sex! You better be ready, Mr. Black, because tonight\u2019s the night!\u201d</p><p>Just reading that made me hard. I\u2019d been craving her, and I couldn\u2019t wait to be inside her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home, don\u2019t you worry about it. By the way, I\u2019m already hard.\u201d I quickly replied.</p><p>\u201cGood. You better make sure you stay that way.\u201d</p><p>As I looked over at my computer, I saw that it was six o\u2019clock. I needed to hurry up and finish going over some papers so I could get home to my wife and daughter. I called the florist and had them deliver two dozen roses to the office so I could bring them home to Ellery. Once the flowers arrived, I was finished for the day. I grabbed my things and headed out the door. Denny was waiting for me like usual in the front. When I opened the door, I threw my briefcase on the seat and climbed in.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful flowers, Connor. You shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Denny. I get to have sex with my wife again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Connor. Is someone looking after Julia while the two of you celebrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Why?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>I sighed because I honestly didn\u2019t know what he meant. As I got out of the limo, I told Denny I\u2019d see him tomorrow. The elevator doors opened and all I could smell was Chinese food. I walked into the kitchen and saw Ellery taking the cartons out of the bag while Julia was awake and sitting in her bouncy seat. When I walked over to Ellery and handed her the flowers, I kissed her firmly on the lips. Julia started to whine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful, Connor. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, baby.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably hungry again,\u201d Ellery said as she looked over at Julia.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feed her.\u201d I smiled. I walked over and took her out of her bouncy seat. The minute I held her, she stopped.</p> <p>\u201cI think she missed her daddy today.\u201d Ellery smiled as she set the food on the table.</p><p>I sat down at the table with her and attempted to eat. The minute I picked up my fork, Julia started to scream. Ellery got up and warmed a bottle for her. She went to take her from me, but I wouldn\u2019t give her up.</p><p>\u201cLet me feed her, Elle. You go and eat. You\u2019ve been with her all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you worked all day. I can feed her so you can eat your dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, now give me the bottle, and let me feed my daughter.\u201d I smiled at her.</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She smiled back as she handed me the bottle.</p><p>When I put the bottle in Julia\u2019s mouth, she instantly started to drink it. As I looked over at Ellery, she glanced at me and ran the tip of her tongue across her lips. She was so beautiful, but she looked so tired.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re getting me hard, and I\u2019m holding our daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops. Sorry.\u201d She smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to burp her.\u201d</p><p>I took the bottle from Julia\u2019s mouth and set it on the table. When I put her over my shoulder and patted her back, she let out a big burp and then started crying for more. Ellery got up from her chair and took her from me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn now. I don\u2019t want you eating cold food,\u201d she said as she kissed me.</p> <p>I took the food from the carton and began eating. The only thing I wanted was to get this dinner over with so I could make love to Ellery. When Julia finished eating, Ellery finished her dinner. I got up from the table and cleaned up while she took the baby upstairs to change her into her pajamas. Once I was done, I grabbed a bottle of wine and two glasses and took them up to our bedroom. When I walked in, I found Ellery and Julia passed out on the bed. I looked down at my cock, which was semi-hard. Just knowing we were finally going to have sex aroused me. As I sighed, I set the bottle of wine on the dresser. I walked over to the bed and carefully picked up Julia. She stirred, opened her eyes, and closed them again. I carried her to her room and laid her down in the crib. As I walked back to the bedroom, I changed into my pajama bottoms, climbed into bed, and wrapped my arms around Ellery.</p><p>\u201cSleep well, my love,\u201d I whispered to her.</p><p>Startled out of a sound sleep, I rolled over, gave Ellery a kiss, and told her to go back to sleep. She was exhausted, and it was my turn to take care of Julia. Her cries echoed through the baby monitor as I got out of bed and headed towards her bedroom. I turned on the lamp and walked over to her crib. As I looked down at her, she looked up at me and stopped crying. After I leaned over and picked her up, I sat down in the rocking chair. I sat and stared at her as she moved her little hands around, cooing and kicking her legs within the blanket in which she was wrapped.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much you and your mommy have changed my life,\u201d I whispered as I softly ran my hand across her cheek and slowly rocked back and forth. \u201cI have so many plans for us. I can\u2019t wait to take you to the park and to the beach. I\u2019m going to teach you how to skate, how to ride a bike, and how to swim. You\u2019ll always know how much Daddy loves you because you\u2019ll hear and feel it every day. You\u2019ve already rocked my world, baby girl, and I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Julia closed her eyes and folded her little hands. I looked up and saw Ellery standing in the doorway, smiling, as a single tear fell down her cheek. As I got up from chair and gently put Julia back in her crib, I walked over to Ellery and wiped her tear away. She wrapped her arms around me and held me tight. As I bent down and picked her up, she brushed her lips against mine. I carried her to the bedroom and laid her on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I fell asleep,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, baby. You\u2019re tired, and you need all the rest you can get,\u201d I whispered as my lips traveled to her neck.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me, Connor.\u201d</p> <p>I took down one strap of her nightgown and softly kissed her exposed breast. The soft groan that came from the back of her throat excited me even more. It had been too long, and I was going to make up for lost time. As I took down the other strap from her shoulder, I sat up in front of her and pulled her nightgown off, exposing her entire body. She looked at me and smiled when I shed my pajama bottoms. My tongue made circles around her belly button as I softly kissed the incision from her C-section. While my mouth was devouring every inch of her torso, my hands were fondling her br**sts, taking her puckered n**ples between my fingers. As she threw her head back and moaned, Ellery moved her fingers swiftly through my hair. I grabbed the string of her panties as she slightly lifted her h*ps and took them down. My finger lightly traced the inside of her thigh, all the way up to her clit. I moved myself up to her lips and forcefully kissed her when I felt the wetness and arousal from her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, baby. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I need you so bad, Connor. I need to feel you inside me.\u201d</p><p>I dipped one finger deep inside her and then another. Her moans grew louder as she moved her h*ps up and down, begging my fingers to pleasure her. I climbed on top of her with my fingers moving in and out, rubbing her cl*t and bringing her to orgasm. Her body shuddered and shook as she released her warm pleasure all over me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d I smiled. \u201cOh, how I\u2019ve missed doing this to you.\u201d</p><p>We stared into each other\u2019s eyes as she whispered, \u201cI want you to look at me as you make love to me.\u201d</p><p>I placed myself inside her while I stared into her beautiful blue eyes. As I pushed myself further inside, the corners of her mouth turned up. Her arms were wrapped around me when I slowly moved in and out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, baby. God, I\u2019ve missed being inside you and feeling you like this.\u201d</p><p>She brought her legs up and wrapped them around me as I picked up my pace and moved in and out of her at a steady speed. Our breathing was rapid and our hearts were racing. As I stared into her eyes with each thrust, she stared back, smiling and running her finger across my lips. I could feel her spasms around my c*ck as she was getting ready to come.</p><p>\u201cEllery,\u201d I moaned as I couldn\u2019t hold back anymore.</p><p>\u201cConnor,\u201d she wailed as I poured myself into her.</p><p>Her body tightened as she threw her head back and came. My lips forcefully locked with hers, and I didn\u2019t want to stop. I finally broke our kiss and looked at her. She was smiling at me as I collapsed on top of her. Our breathing was shallow, and our heart rates were beating at the same speed.</p><p>\u201cGod, how I\u2019ve missed hav**g s*x with you,\u201d Ellery said breathlessly.</p><p>I kissed her neck before rolling off of her. \u201cI\u2019ve missed it too, baby. You felt so good,\u201d I said as I ran the back of my hand across her cheek.</p><p>Suddenly, little sounds came through the monitor. Ellery and I looked at the monitor on the dresser. Julia was stirring in her crib. A soft cry came from her and we looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll get her if she continues to cry.\u201d I smiled as I ran my finger across her jaw line.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay; I\u2019ll get her. You just worked very hard.\u201d Ellery smiled back.</p><p>We lay there in each other\u2019s arms, staring at the monitor and waiting for Julia to wake up. She didn\u2019t. As I reached my hand down in between Ellery\u2019s legs, I whispered, \u201cAre you ready for round two?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Ellery</p><p>As I awoke, I reached over to put my arm around Connor, but his side of the bed was empty. I sat up and looked around. I didn\u2019t hear the shower running and Julia wasn\u2019t in her crib. I put my robe on and walked down the stairs to the kitchen. Connor was sitting at the table with Julia in his arms, feeding her a bottle.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, baby.\u201d He smiled as he looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said as I walked over and gave him and Julia a kiss. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me? I would\u2019ve gotten her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked so peaceful sleeping, and I was already awake when she woke up.\u201d</p><p>I poured a cup of coffee and sat down in the chair next to him. He looked so sexy in his black suit, and I wanted to take him upstairs and devour him before he had to leave for the office.</p><p>\u201cIs something special going on today? You hardly ever wear a suit to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go to court today. I told you last week,\u201d he said as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cShit, Ashlyn and the trial. I completely forgot. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You just had a baby and you\u2019re still trying to adjust. Don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said as he put Julia over his shoulder to burp her.</p><p>Denny walked into the kitchen and headed straight to the coffee pot.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d He smiled as he looked at us.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Denny.\u201d I smiled in return.</p><p>As Connor was burping Julia, she decided to spit up all down the back of his suit coat. I jumped up as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d he said.</p><p>I tried so hard to contain my laughter, as did Denny, but we both couldn\u2019t hold it anymore. I took Julia from Connor and held her while Denny handed him a towel.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know by now that you shouldn\u2019t feed a baby while wearing a suit?\u201d Denny asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess I do now,\u201d Connor said as he walked out of the kitchen and up the stairs to change.</p><p>Claire came into the kitchen, and I handed Julia to her. I walked upstairs and into the bedroom where Connor was pulling out another suit from the closet. I stood there with a smirk on my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI just think it\u2019s funny; that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s funny that our daughter spit up all over my five-thousand-dollar suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, and you don\u2019t need a five-thousand-dollar suit anyway. That\u2019s a ridiculous amount of money to spend. No one is going to know it costs that much, and you look just as sexy in a five- hundred-dollar suit.\u201d</p><p>Connor pursed his lips together and put the suit he pulled out back in the closet. As he started walking slowly towards me, I knew the look on his face, and I knew I was in trouble. When he approached me, I put up my hands to prevent him from coming any closer. He grabbed my hands and threw me on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much I love it when you babble on like that.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Connor, whatever you do, don\u2019t tickle me,\u201d I begged.</p><p>Suddenly, we heard Denny\u2019s voice from downstairs. \u201cConnor, let\u2019s go. You\u2019re already late.\u201d</p><p>Connor kissed me on the lips. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky, Mrs. Black. But make no mistake; we will continue this tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d I winked.</p><p>Connor let go of my hands and walked back to the closet and pulled out his suit. I went back to the kitchen and took Julia from Claire. Shortly after changing his suit, Connor came down, grabbed his briefcase, and we walked him to the elevator. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBye, my beautiful little girl.\u201d Connor smiled as he kissed Julia on her head. \u201cAnd goodbye to you, my beautiful wife,\u201d he said as he kissed me on the lips.</p><p>\u201cBye, babe. Good luck and call me.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a small smile before the elevator doors closed. I took Julia upstairs to change her diaper. Since I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the trial, I was pissed that Connor wasn\u2019t talking to me about it. I wanted to be there for him, but since Julia had been born, I hadn\u2019t had time to think about anything else but her, and I was exhausted all the time. I changed Julia\u2019s diaper and carried her downstairs to find my phone. As I grabbed it off the kitchen counter, I dialed Peyton.</p><p>\u201cHello, bestie. Did you and Connor have amazing sex last night?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Peyton, and yes, we did have amazing sex, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I thought you\u2019d want to talk about it,\u201d she said with a disappointed tone.</p><p>\u201cAre you busy today?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cI just have a few errands to run. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor is at the courthouse because the trial is starting today, and I really want to be there for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he ask you to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and he wouldn\u2019t either. You know how he is. I just wanted to know if you could watch Julia for a few hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll watch that beautiful goddaughter of mine!\u201d she squealed.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peyton. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll be over in about thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>As I was putting Julia in her bouncy seat, Denny walked into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back. I need you to drive me to the courthouse,\u201d I said as I looked at him.</p> <p>\u201cElle, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. You shouldn\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if I should or shouldn\u2019t. I want to, and I want to be there for my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that, but I don\u2019t think Connor wants you there.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you know me by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Just let me know when you\u2019re ready.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>I smiled as I walked over and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cThank you, Denny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019ll probably yell at me for doing this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. If he says anything, I\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>I asked Denny if he could keep an eye on Julia while I went to get ready. As I was putting on my black skirt, Peyton came strolling into the bedroom, holding her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this, Elle?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that bitch is crazy, and you haven\u2019t seen her since you punched her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I haven\u2019t and that\u2019s why it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>I put on my black heels, handed Peyton the diaper bag, and kissed Julia goodbye. \u201cEverything you need is in here. If you\u2019re going to take her with you on errands, then you\u2019ll need the stroller and it\u2019s in the hallway by the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom. I\u2019ve got this!\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cDenny, I\u2019m ready to leave,\u201d I said as I grabbed by purse and we stepped onto the elevator.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Connor</p><p>I sat outside the courtroom, waiting for the trial to begin. I hadn\u2019t seen Ashlyn since that day at the gym.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Connor,\u201d Phil said. \u201cShe\u2019ll get what she deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just hope the jury finds her guilty.\u201d</p><p>As we walked into the courtroom and sat down, I looked over and saw Ellery walking towards me. I instantly stood up.</p><p>\u201cEllery, what are you doing here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be here for you, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want you here. I don\u2019t want you involved in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that, Connor. I\u2019m your wife, and whatever you\u2019re involved in, involves me. Now if you don\u2019t want me here, that\u2019s too f**king bad, because I\u2019m here to support you whether you want me to or not. So deal with it, buddy!\u201d she exclaimed through gritted teeth.</p><p>I sighed as I looked at her, shook my head, and sat down. She said hello to Phil and then sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Julia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeyton is watching her,\u201d she replied.</p><p>The lawyers walked into the courtroom and took their seats up front. The guard opened the door off to the side and escorted Ashlyn into the room.</p><p>\u201cRemind me to tell her how becoming that orange jumpsuit is on her and those chain accessories are to die for,\u201d Ellery whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou are to stay away from her,\u201d I warned.</p><p>Ashlyn looked directly at me as she entered the courtroom, and then looked directly at Ellery. I put my hand on her thigh because I was nervous she was going to get pissed and start something. Ellery could have quite a temper. She put her hand on mine and looked over at me.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Connor.\u201d</p><p>I took in a deep breath as the judge entered the courtroom. Ashlyn\u2019s attorney stood up and asked the judge for a postponement due to her change of plea.</p><p>\u201cYour honor, my client is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity due to the mental distress she was put under by Mr. Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>As I gasped, Ellery turned and looked at me. Her eyes were wide and angry. I couldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019d just heard. My heart started racing.</p><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d the judge asked as he looked at Ashlyn.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, your Honor,\u201d she said as she nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cFine. The trial is postponed until one week from today,\u201d he said as he got up from his seat and went into his chambers.</p><p>As the guard walked Ashlyn out of the courtroom, she looked over at me and blew me a kiss. When Ellery went to get up, I grabbed her arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cConnor, this is bullshit!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is bullshit. I need to meet with my personal attorney,\u201d I said.</p><p>As we got up from our seats, I grabbed Ellery\u2019s hand and led her out of the courtroom. When we reached the hallway, I pulled her into me and held her tight.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine, Elle; I don\u2019t want you worrying about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d she said.</p><p>I kissed her on the head and called Lou, my personal attorney. When I hung up the phone from him, I walked over to the bench where Ellery was sitting and talking on the phone. When she hung up, she looked at me with sadness in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho where you talking to?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cPeyton. I was checking on Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She wants to keep Julia a little while longer and then when Henry gets home from the hospital, they\u2019ll bring her home. I invited them for dinner. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, sweetheart,\u201d I said as I took her hand and softly kissed it. \u201cI think we could use some good friends tonight,\u201d she said.</p><p>I helped her up from the bench and put my arm around her as we walked out of the building. As I opened the door to the limo, Ellery climbed in and, instantly, Denny knew something was wrong. I sat down next to her and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened in there?\u201d Denny asked.</p><p>\u201cAshlyn changed her plea to not guilty by reason of insanity, and she\u2019s blaming it on mental distress caused by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>Ellery\u2019s eyes started to swell with tears as she looked out her window. I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her closer as I buried my face into her neck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you upset over this. Things are going to work out,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an evil bitch, Connor, and she\u2019ll go to whatever lengths necessary to destroy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllery, I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well neither am I,\u201d she said.</p><p>I pulled back and looked at her. \u201cYou are to stay away from Ashlyn. Do you understand me?\u201d I said in a firm voice.</p><p>She looked at me with those blue eyes. They had a look in them that I knew all too well; the look of defiance and anger. She tilted her head as her lips formed a small smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, Connor, I understand you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Ellery</p><p>When we arrived home, I went upstairs to change. A few minutes later, Connor came into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I turned around and looked at him as I slipped off my skirt. \u201cNo. Why would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not saying anything and you have that look.\u201d</p><p>The fact of the matter was that I was a little upset with him for using a firm tone with me in the limo.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I\u2019m not mad at you. I\u2019m just a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little what?\u201d he asked as he walked over to me and started unbuttoning my blouse.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you need to stop,\u201d I said as I put my hand up and backed away.</p><p>He inched closer to me with a smile on his face as he slipped off my blouse.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I need to stop? I thought you loved it when I undressed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. It\u2019s just you\u2019re distracting me from my thoughts. To be honest with you, I\u2019m pissed that you used that tone with me earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou use that tone with me all the time, and I find it sexy,\u201d he whispered as his hot breath on my neck made me quiver.</p><p>I bit down on my bottom lip and closed my eyes. He knew damn well what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cConnor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, baby. Just enjoy what I\u2019m doing to you,\u201d he whispered as his hand pushed my thong to the side and he slipped in his finger.</p><p>I gasped as pleasure overtook my body. He stared at me while slowly moving his finger in and out of me as a small smile escaped his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d I moaned as I unbuttoned his pants and slid them down.</p><p>I wrapped my fingers around his c*ck and stroked him up and down. He threw his head back as a groan came from the back of his throat. He removed his fingers and pushed me against the wall. His mouth crashed into mine as I wrapped my legs around him and he buried himself inside me with force. He moved at a fast pace. Our hearts were racing and our breathing was shallow as he moved in and out of me, bringing me to orgasm.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Connor,\u201d I yelled as my body shook.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, baby,\u201d he shouted as I felt his warmth shoot inside me.</p><p>He stood there, my legs still wrapped around his waist, and his hands firmly cupping my ass.</p><p>\u201cNow what was it you were saying?\u201d He smiled.</p><p>I tilted my head back as he slid his tongue across my throat. \u201cWe better get ready. Peyton and Henry will be here soon.\u201d Connor pulled out of me, kissed me on the lips, and walked to the bathroom. I pulled a pair of jeans from the drawer and got dressed. As I sat on the edge of the bed, I started to cry. Connor came out of the bathroom and kneeled down in front of me. He took my hands in his.</p><p>\u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong? Did I hurt you?\u201d he asked in a panic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head. \u201cI miss Julia, and I want her home,\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cAw, Ellery. Come here, baby,\u201d he said as he wrapped his arms around me. \u201cShe\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, I heard voices coming from downstairs. I jumped up from the bed and flew down the stairs. When I saw Peyton and Henry by the door, I grabbed the car seat from Henry\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cJulia, Mommy missed you so much,\u201d I cried as I took her out of her car seat and held her tight.</p> <p>\u201cGod, Elle. Are you okay?\u201d Peyton asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Connor said as he came walking down the stairs. \u201cShe just missed Julia.\u201d</p><p>Connor walked over and kissed Peyton on the cheek. \u201cThank you for looking after her,\u201d he said, and then walked over and shook Henry\u2019s hand. Connor kissed Julia on the head and told her how much he missed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d Peyton asked as she sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cI missed her, Peyton. It was the first time we\u2019d been apart since I found out I was pregnant, and it was hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, sweetie,\u201d she said as she put her arm around me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I should have just brought her home sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, and thank you again for taking care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it go at court today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I looked at her with a sullen look, but I didn\u2019t have to say a word. The single tear that fell from my eye said enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Elle? What did she do, or didn\u2019t, or whatever? What the f**k happened?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it over dinner. I don\u2019t want to talk about it now and then again.\u201d</p> <p>As Julia started to cry, Connor walked over and took her from me so I could get a bottle ready. I got up from the couch and walked into the kitchen. Peyton followed behind.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you fitted for your maid of honor dress,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cUgh, I know. I just have a few more pounds to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you look great, but if you insist, then I suggest you hit the gym and hit it fast. You have one month and then you\u2019re going for your fitting,\u201d she announced.</p><p>I took out the pizza menu from the drawer and looked it over. I grabbed my cell phone and called an order for delivery. I warmed up a bottle and Peyton and I walked back into the living room where Henry and Connor were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feed her, babe,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cI can feed her, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Henry, look at them. They\u2019re fighting over who feeds Julia. That\u2019s so sweet!\u201d Peyton squealed.</p> <p>I smiled at Connor and gave him the bottle. I walked over to the bar and Peyton sat down on the stool.</p><p>\u201cPour me some hard liquor, bartender,\u201d she said with an accent.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do some shots.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I took down two shot glasses and grabbed the bottle of Jack Daniels. I poured a shot into each glass.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to a f**ked up day!\u201d I smiled as I held up my glass.</p><p>Peyton smiled as we both downed our whiskey and slammed our glasses on the granite top of the bar. The burn made its way down my throat. Peyton looked at me.</p><p>\u201cRemind me again why you drink this shit,\u201d she said.</p><p>I laughed as I poured another shot and Connor came walking over to me with Julia in his arms.</p><p>\u201cKeep that up and you\u2019ll be drunk before you know it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLast shot. I promise.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Julia fell asleep, so Connor took her upstairs and put her in her crib. The pizza had arrived and we all went into the kitchen and sat down at the table.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell us what happened today?\u201d Peyton asked as she grabbed a slice of pizza.</p><p>\u201cAshlyn changed her plea to not guilty by reason of temporary insanity due to the distress I apparently caused her,\u201d Connor explained.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! That stupid bitch!\u201d Peyton yelled.</p><p>\u201cConnor, that\u2019s crazy,\u201d Henry said as he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crazy,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, we all know that bitch is crazy. So now what?\u201d Peyton asked.</p><p>\u201cNow, we get to rehash the past and all the shit that went on between her and Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllery, don\u2019t,\u201d Connor said as he looked at me.</p><p>I looked away because I didn\u2019t want to go through this again. Not now; not ever.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Connor</p><p>Peyton and Henry left, and Ellery went upstairs to check on Julia. I walked over to the bar and poured myself a scotch. I could see how upset Ellery was and it killed me not to be able to make it better for her. This was just the beginning of a long and painful road, and I\u2019d do whatever it took to shield my family from it. I walked up the steps and stopped in the doorway of the nursery. Ellery was sitting in the rocking chair, rocking Julia. As I stood there and smiled, she looked up at me with her sad eyes. I walked over to her and knelt down, placing my hands on her legs.</p><p>\u201cI want you to listen to me, Elle. We\u2019re going to get through this. I talked to Lou and he said not to worry about it, and that we\u2019ll talk in the morning. He\u2019s going to do some investigating. You know he\u2019s the best lawyer in the country, and he\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way we\u2019ll get through it, Connor, is together. There can\u2019t be any secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, baby, and there won\u2019t be. You\u2019ll be with me every step of the way,\u201d I said.</p><p>She smiled at me as she ran the back of her hand down my cheek. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>I took her hand and held it against my lips as I closed my eyes. \u201cI love you too, and you better never, for even one single moment, forget it.\u201d</p><p>I stood up and took Julia from her arms. I kissed her tiny head and laid her down in her crib. Ellery took my hand and we walked down the hall to our bedroom. She changed into her satin nightgown and I undressed. We climbed into bed, and I wrapped my arms around her as she snuggled against me and fell sound asleep.</p><p>When the buzzing alarm went off, Ellery rolled over and looked at me. We looked at each other and jumped out of bed.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Julia never woke up last night!\u201d she said in a panic.</p><p>We ran to her room to check on her. As we looked in her crib, she looked at us and smiled. Ellery gasped and put her hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cConnor, she smiled! Did you see it?\u201d she asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I saw her.\u201d I smiled as I picked her up from her crib and stared at her. Her smile was just like Ellery\u2019s, and I knew right then and there, I was in trouble. \u201cShe has your smile, Ellery. That means all the boys are going to fall in love with her, and we\u2019re going to have quite a problem on our hands.\u201d</p><p>Ellery laughed and put her arm around my waist. \u201cThe only problem we\u2019re going to have is if you become one of those overprotective fathers that scare all the boys away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not allowed to date. I know what boys are like and they\u2019re not getting their hands on my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor,\u201d Ellery paused. \u201cDo you realize that our little girl slept through the night?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Ellery, who was beaming from head to toe. \u201cYou\u2019re right. She did sleep through the night.\u201d I smiled as I held her up in the air.</p><p>I passed Julia to Ellery as I ran to the other room to grab my ringing phone. I picked it up and saw that Lou was calling.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lou,\u201d I said as I answered.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Connor. I have a quick meeting this morning and then I\u2019ll stop by your office, let\u2019s say around eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there, Lou, and thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, buddy. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and turned around. Ellery was standing behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is our meeting?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOur meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in this together, babe, and I\u2019m meeting Lou with you.\u201d</p><p>I sighed as I kissed her on the lips. \u201cEleven o\u2019clock at my office. I\u2019ll make sure to have Denny drive you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said as she turned and walked downstairs with Julia.</p><p>I stepped into the shower and stood under the hot water. Thoughts of Ashlyn kept entering my mind and how she could potentially destroy my life, especially with her lies. The thought of my relationship with her and our arrangement coming out made me sick to my stomach. I finished up in the shower, wrapped a towel around my waist, and walked into the bedroom. Ellery was standing in front of the mirror in her bra and panties, staring at herself.</p><p>\u201cAre you admiring that beautiful body of yours?\u201d I asked as I walked up behind her and put my hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m disgusted by how much weight I still have to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. Your body is just as amazing now as it was before you got pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only saying that so you can get laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah! Is that what you really think?\u201d I laughed as I picked her up, threw her on the bed, and started to tickle her until she couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>I stopped and stared into her beautiful blue eyes. The smile that I loved so much didn\u2019t leave her face as she stared back. I pushed her hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Connor,\u201d she replied as she traced my lips with her finger.</p><p>All I wanted was to make love to her at that moment. I didn\u2019t care what time it was. The world could wait when I was with her. I lowered my head and gently nipped her bottom lip. As she softly moaned, Julia\u2019s screams, coming from downstairs, snapped us back into our little family world; a world where it was no longer just the two of us, but now the three of us.</p><p>We smiled at each other as I sighed and got up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re going to have to get used to working our sex schedule around Julia,\u201d I said as I walked to the closet and pulled out some clothes.</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Ellery laughed as she got up, got dressed, and headed downstairs.</p><p>When I arrived at the office, I sat down at my desk and went through my messages. As I turned my chair around and stared out onto the city of New York, Phil walked in.</p><p>\u201cDid you have your meeting with Lou yet?\u201d he asked as he sat down.</p><p>\u201cToday at eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn that bitch. She\u2019s crazy and she\u2019s trying to avoid going to prison for the next 25 years. You do realize that she\u2019ll destroy you and this company in the process, right?\u201d</p><p>I got up from my chair. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d I scowled.</p><p>\u201cShe needs to be stopped, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019ll talk to Lou and see what he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to finish some things up. I\u2019ll be back at eleven for that meeting.\u201d Phil sighed as he walked out of the office.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Ellery</p><p>Julia was being fussy. She was continuously crying, and I felt like I was going to pull my hair out. She wouldn\u2019t take a bottle, she didn\u2019t want her pacifier, and she didn\u2019t want to be put down. Even as I held her, she still screamed. I felt so bad because I didn\u2019t know what to do. Tears started streaming down my face as I paced the floors with her. I didn\u2019t want to call Connor because he had enough to worry about. Just as I was thinking that, my phone rang and it was him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said as I tried to sound as if I wasn\u2019t crying.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby. Why is Julia screaming like that?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hold it together anymore as I broke down. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She just won\u2019t stop and I don\u2019t know what to do for her,\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone else there with you?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m here by myself. Connor, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with her. She just won\u2019t stop crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way, Ellery,\u201d he said as he hung up the phone.</p><p>I tried to tell him not to come home, but he had already hung up. I held Julia up over my shoulder and patted her back. She screamed. I bounced her as I walked up and down the stairs. She screamed. I sat in the rocking chair and tried to rock her. She screamed. I literally was going to lose it. As I walked back down the stairs with her, Connor stepped out of the elevator. He walked over to me and took Julia. As he looked at me, he wiped the tears from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should call the doctor,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow long as she been like this?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cAbout an hour and a half. All she\u2019s been doing is screaming.\u201d I started to cry again.</p><p>Connor walked around the penthouse with her. He tried the same things as I had done and nothing was working. When I grabbed my phone and started to dial the doctor, the doorbell rang. I put my phone down and opened the door. I was shocked when I saw who was standing in front of me.</p><p>\u201cMason! What\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, what the hell is wrong? Why are you crying?\u201d he interrupted as he walked through the door.</p><p>Before I could answer, Connor came back into the room with a screaming Julia.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, give me that baby!\u201d Mason said as he walked over and took her from Connor.</p> <p>The minute Mason held her over his arm, Julia stopped crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Connor said as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cHi to you too, Connor.\u201d Mason smiled.</p><p>\u201cMason, how did you\u2014she has been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gassy. You couldn\u2019t tell that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Connor and I stood there and just looked at him as he rubbed Julia\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cElle, I love you, but you\u2019re a hot mess right now. You need to go clean yourself up.\u201d Mason smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d I said as I walked over and hugged him.</p> <p>\u201cGo on. We\u2019ll talk when you come back down,\u201d he said as he kissed my cheek.</p><p>I went upstairs and into the bathroom. Mason was right; I looked like a hot mess. As I was standing in front of the mirror, wiping the mascara stains from my face, Connor walked in.</p><p>\u201cYou should see him with her. He\u2019s a natural,\u201d Connor whispered.</p><p>\u201cI saw that the minute he took her and she stopped crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby,\u201d he said as he turned me around and wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>I stood there, wrapped safely in his arms, when suddenly, something dawned on me. \u201cConnor, the meeting with Lou!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I rescheduled for later this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a bad mother and wife.\u201d I began to cry.</p><p>\u201cAw, baby. You\u2019re not a bad mother or wife. Don\u2019t ever say that again. You\u2019re overwhelmed. Henry thinks that maybe you\u2019re going through post-partum depression.\u201d</p><p>I pushed back and looked at him in anger. \u201cI\u2019m not depressed, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were depressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did! You just said you think I have post-partum depression. Do you hear the word depression, Connor? Depressed, depression; same thing, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>Connor rolled his eyes and walked away. I followed behind him down the stairs. When I reached the living room, Mason was sitting on the couch talking to Julia and she was cooing. Connor and I looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cHey, she\u2019s happy.\u201d I smiled as I sat down next to them.</p><p>\u201cOf course she is. She\u2019s with her Uncle Mason.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Connor sat down next me and kissed me on the head. \u201cA kiss from an idiot,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll make it up to you later.\u201d I smiled as I kissed the tip of his nose.</p><p>Mason looked at us and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see both of you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too. What are you doing in New York, and why didn\u2019t you tell me you were coming?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cLandon got a job with a top modeling agency, and they wanted him to move here. So, here we are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Landon?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cHe had a meeting with his agent, so I decided that I\u2019d take my chances and see if you were home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you and Landon living?\u201d I asked as I reached over and took Julia from him.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d ask that!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWe\u2019ve rented a loft over on the next block.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. That means we can see you whenever we want.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cWe can take this little princess shopping, and we can hang out at Starbucks! He smiled as he touched Julia\u2019s hand. God, Elle, I\u2019m so excited!\u201d</p><p>Connor looked at his watch. \u201cLou\u2019s going to be at my office in thirty minutes. We better get going. I\u2019ll grab the diaper bag,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>I nodded my head and got up from the couch. \u201cMason, we have a meeting with Connor\u2019s lawyer, so we have to get going. Why don\u2019t we get together for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great. I\u2019ll ask Landon if we have plans. You\u2019re not taking Julia with you, are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, we are, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her here with me. Please, Ellery, let me watch her,\u201d he begged.</p><p>Connor walked up behind me. \u201cI can\u2019t find the diaper bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over there,\u201d Mason said as he pointed by the door.</p><p>\u201cEllery, hand Julia over to Mason so we can leave,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>A wide smile spread across Mason\u2019s face. \u201cGive me the little princess, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly became nervous. I didn\u2019t want to leave her again, but then the thought of her screaming her head off during the meeting frightened me. I kissed her on the head and handed her over to Mason, who was standing there with his arms out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Momma; she\u2019ll be safe with me,\u201d Mason said.</p><p>I smiled and followed Connor to the elevator. I stopped, turned around, and looked at Mason.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get Julia to stop fussing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe gas drops in the diaper bag, Elle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so that\u2019s what that little white bottle was for,\u201d I said as I stepped in and the doors closed.</p><p>Denny was on the other side of town, so Connor drove the Range Rover to the office. Before we reached the building, he called his secretary, Valerie, to send someone down to park it. He pulled up to the curb, walked around, and opened my door. He grabbed my hand as we walked into the building and took the elevator up to the top floor where Connor\u2019s office was. As we stepped off the elevator, I could see the women looking up from behind their cubicles at my husband. I could see the look and hunger in their eyes when he walked by. I proudly held my head up and smiled as I said, \u201cGood afternoon, ladies.\u201d Connor looked over at me and smiled.</p><p>When we reached his office, Lou and another gentleman were already sitting down and waiting. Phil came in behind us.</p><p>\u201cLou, thanks for meeting me,\u201d Connor said as he shook his hand.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I want you to meet Ben. He just joined the firm.\u201d</p><p>As Connor shook Ben\u2019s hand, Lou leaned over and kissed me on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Ellery.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>I took a seat in between Lou and Ben as Connor walked around and sat behind his desk. Lou folded his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you, Connor. This could get very ugly. I\u2019ve decided we\u2019re going after her personally for the Chicago fire. I know you didn\u2019t want to do it, but if she wants to claim that she was temporarily insane because of the mental stress you put her through, then we\u2019ll fight back. I\u2019ve already alerted the district attorney\u2019s office that we\u2019re proceeding with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lou. That\u2019s not even an option,\u201d Connor snapped.</p><p>\u201cWe have no choice, Connor. Ashlyn is forcing your hand on this. She\u2019s going to make sure you go down with her.\u201d</p><p>Connor stood up, put his hands in his pockets, and turned towards the window. \u201cThis is bullshit, Lou. I need you to make this go away,\u201d he said.</p><p>I sat there in silence as I listened to the conversation between Connor and Lou. I could tell Connor was worried, although he\u2019d never admit it. My phone chimed and, as I pulled it from my purse, I noticed a text message from Mason.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with your little princess.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, and Connor asked me if everything was okay. I nodded my head and then watched him glare at Ben. I noticed he did that quite a bit since we sat down. Lou got up from his seat and told Connor that he\u2019d get back with him in a couple of days. As Phil walked Lou and Ben out of the office, Connor called Ben back. He turned around and started walking towards Connor. I stood up from my chair because I didn\u2019t like the look on Connor\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDo you find my wife attractive?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I gasped as my eyes widened. \u201cConnor!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWell, do you? Answer the damn question,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes, Mr. Black,\u201d Ben answered nervously.</p><p>\u201cThen that explains why you\u2019ve been staring at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, that\u2019s enough!\u201d I snapped at him.</p><p>Ben looked at me and apologized. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for staring, but I feel like we\u2019ve met before.\u201d Suddenly, it must have hit him. \u201cI know; you were Kyle\u2019s girlfriend back in college.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, trying to figure out who he was, and then it came to me. \u201cBen? As in Ben Winston, Debate Club President and tech geek extraordinaire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s me!\u201d He laughed. \u201cI knew you looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it.\u201d</p><p>Just as I gave him a hug and Connor gave me a dirty look, Cassidy walked in.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I thought you were alone, Connor,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cassidy. Come on in,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cassidy walked over to me and gave me a hug. \u201cWhere\u2019s my niece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at home with Mason. I would like you to meet Ben Winston. Ben, this is my sister-in-law, Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>They lightly shook hands as I turned and looked at Connor. \u201cYou owe Ben an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know for what, Connor. That was rude and uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>Connor took in a sharp breath and shook his head. \u201cBen, I apologize for being rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mr. Black. If some dude was staring at my beautiful wife or girlfriend, I\u2019d be upset too. Well, it was nice seeing you again, Ellery, and nice to meet you, Cassidy. Mr. Black, we\u2019ll be in touch in a couple of days,\u201d Ben said as he started to walk out of the office. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHold on. I\u2019m leaving too. I\u2019ll walk out with you.\u201d Cassidy smiled.</p><p>\u201cBut, Cass\u2014\u201d</p><p>I walked over to Connor and put my hand over his mouth. \u201cShe thinks he\u2019s hot. Let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d he mumbled.</p> <p>I removed my hand from his mouth and kissed him softly. \u201cLeave your sister alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot yet you didn\u2019t. But you have that look.\u201d</p><p>Connor looked at his watch. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d He smiled as he put his arm around me.</p><p>Chapter 12</p> <p>Connor</p><p>We both climbed into the Range Rover, and I sat there with my hands on the wheel. I looked over at Ellery as she looked at herself in a small mirror. When she stopped looking at herself, she turned her eyes to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what Cassidy did in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? She saw a hot guy and she took advantage of the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you think he\u2019s hot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s cute,\u201d Ellery replied as she put on her lipstick.</p><p>\u201cI bet you thought he was hot back in college too,\u201d I said as I pulled out of the parking space.</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous because I said he was hot, Mr. Black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019m not jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. I can tell by that look on your face.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, babe, but there\u2019s no need for you to be jealous. You know I think you\u2019re the sexiest man alive,\u201d she said as she stroked my cheek and gave me a small smile.</p><p>I smiled and we drove home. Ellery became impatient with the traffic because she wanted to get back to Julia. We didn\u2019t talk about the meeting, but I could tell Ellery was upset about it. I didn\u2019t want her involved in this at all. If I had my way, she wouldn\u2019t know anything. I only wanted to protect me and shield her from this bullshit. She didn\u2019t deserve to have to go through this because of my past mistakes and poor judgment.</p> <p>When we arrived at the penthouse and the elevator doors opened, Ellery threw her purse on the table and walked into the living room. Mason was sitting on the floor and had Julia under her play gym. I walked over to the bar and poured myself a scotch. I pulled out my phone and sent a text message to Cassidy.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you need to see me earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted your opinion on a color for the office I\u2019m redoing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should have stuck around instead of chasing after that guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLol, Connor. Tell Ellery I\u2019ll call her later. Bye.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and set my phone down on the bar. I stared across the room at Ellery as she sat on the floor and played with Julia. She looked up at me with her beautiful eyes and a small smile graced her face. Mason got up from the floor and said that he needed to go. He picked Julia up, kissed her, and then kissed Ellery goodbye. I gave him a simple wave from across the room and told him to take care. When he left, Ellery came walking over to me with Julia. I took the baby from her, kissed her head, and held her in my arms.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to Mason about working for us as Julia\u2019s nanny,\u201d Ellery said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I thought you didn\u2019t want a nanny for Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t at first, but did you see how he was with her? He\u2019s a natural, and Julia seems to really like him. Plus, it\u2019s time for me to start painting again and, with the whole Ashlyn ordeal, I\u2019m going to need help.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I pushed back a strand of her blonde hair. \u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019ve decided that you needed help, and I think Mason would be perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll set up lunch and discuss it with him.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were having dinner with him and Landon tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon told Mason they\u2019d have to take a rain check because they have some event with the modeling agency to attend tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab Julia\u2019s diaper bag and car seat. We\u2019re going out to dinner,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGood, then we need to stop at the store and pick up some diapers and formula,\u201d she said as she walked away.</p><p>We put Julia in the Range Rover and drove to the restaurant. As we were eating, she decided she was hungry and started to scream. Ellery instantly took her from her seat as people in the restaurant started to stare. I grabbed a bottle from the diaper bag and handed it to Ellery as fast as I could. The second the bottle hit Julia\u2019s mouth, she stopped crying. We both let out a sigh of relief. It didn\u2019t last long, because when Ellery went to burp her, she screamed the minute the bottle came out of her mouth. This was an upscale restaurant and the patrons weren\u2019t happy that their quiet dinner was being interrupted by a screaming baby. I gave Ellery a look indicating that she needed to do something.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, Connor?\u201d she growled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; don\u2019t burp her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to be burped.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Ellery looked over at the couple that was sitting at the table next to us and staring. \u201cWhat? Have you never heard a baby cry before? Turn yourselves around and mind your own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllery!\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over this,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ellery got up from the table and headed out of the restaurant. I sighed and called over the waitress for the bill. As soon as she gave it to me, I threw the money on the table and walked out after her. I found her walking down the street, carrying Julia over her shoulder. I quickly caught up with her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, that was inexcusable back there,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know it was, and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said as she kept walking.</p><p>I lightly took ahold of her arm. \u201cElle, stop and look at me. I love you, no matter how much you embarrass me.\u201d I smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to adjust to having to go out with a new baby. We\u2019ll make mistakes along the way, but we\u2019ll get it right eventually.\u201d</p><p>Ellery laughed when I said that. \u201cTrial and error, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby, trial and error,\u201d I said as I kissed her head.</p><p>She handed Julia to me and we walked back to the Range Rover. After we stopped at the store to pick up diapers and formula, we went home.</p><p>After we gave Julia a bath and changed her into her pajamas, I sat on the bed and fed her a bottle while Ellery took a shower. I stared down at her as she was looking up at me. She had the same eyes as Ellery, which made me melt. This little girl was going to be my undoing, and I had a feeling she was going to take advantage of it when she was older.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time me and you had a talk, Julia. You\u2019re beautiful just like your mommy and some issues are going to come up that we\u2019re not going to see eye to eye on. The boys are going to fall all over you and they\u2019re going to want to date you. I just want you to know that you\u2019re never allowed to date boys. You\u2019re Daddy\u2019s little girl, and you always will be. I should be the only man in your life. When I pass away, then you can date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor!\u201d I heard Ellery snap. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that, and you cannot keep her from dating boys.\u201d Ellery laughed.</p><p>\u201cI can try, can\u2019t I?\u201d I smirked.</p><p>I put Julia over my shoulder and burped her. She laid her head down on my shoulder and fell asleep. When I got up from the bed, I walked her over to Ellery so she could kiss her goodnight. When I approached the nursery, I carefully laid Julia down in her crib so as not to disturb her. I needed her to sleep so I could spend some alone time with my wife. Ellery was sitting on the edge of the bed with a towel wrapped around her, putting lotion on her legs.</p><p>\u201cLet me do that for you.\u201d I smiled as I took the bottle of lotion from her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad boy, Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fully intend to be, Mrs. Black.\u201d</p><p>I squirted some lotion on my hands and began rubbing her leg. I moved my hands slowly up and down, applying a light pressure with my thumbs. As I began to rub the top of her foot, she threw head back and moaned.</p><p>\u201cThat feels so good, Connor,\u201d she said.</p><p>My hands made their way to the sole of her foot. I smiled while I watched the look on her face. Pleasuring her was the only thing I wanted to do. Moving my thumbs up to her heel, I applied more pressure as I moved my thumbs in circles. Her groans grew louder as I reached the ball of her foot and massaged it deeply.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Connor. I could come right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, don\u2019t say things like that, and you better not. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>Before massaging her toes, I took them in my mouth and lightly nipped at each one. I was driving her crazy, and I loved every minute of it. I put more lotion on my hands and started on her other leg and foot. As I reached her thighs, I pushed the edge of the towel back and began rubbing small circles all the way up, focusing on her inner thigh. Ellery\u2019s moans grew louder as she lay all the way down on the bed. Since I couldn\u2019t take my lips not touching her skin, I leaned forward and began to kiss each area of her thigh that I massaged. Taking her towel in my hands, I undid it, and I let it fall to the sides of her, exposing her fully nak*d body. My hands made their way up her torso as they clasped on to her beautiful br**sts, pinching and kneading her hardened n**ples.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so hard, Ellery. The things you do to me,\u201d I whispered as my lips made their way up her thigh.</p><p>I pushed her legs further apart as she lay there, open, and begging me to make her come. My mouth explored her moist skin as my tongue lightly circled around her clit. I dipped my finger inside her as she lifted her h*ps and moved them around as my finger played inside her. I placed my thumb on her swollen cl*t and began to lightly rub it as her body stiffened and she grabbed each side of the bed. As she let out a scream of pleasure, my tongue licked its way up her breast and my mouth closed itself around her hard nipple. Ellery was panting and staring at me as I stood up and took down my pants and boxers. I smiled at her as she lifted her arms above her head and crossed her wrists. I slowly climbed on top of her and clasped her wrists tightly. She gasped as my hard cock, which sat between her legs, thrust into her. I leaned my face in closer and tugged at her bottom lip with my teeth as I pounded into her over and over again.</p><p>\u201cHarder, Connor,\u201d she begged.</p><p>I tightened the grip around her wrists and moved quickly in and out of her, smashing my mouth against hers in a passionate kiss. She swelled around me as her legs tightened and her body shook with ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cChrist, baby,\u201d I yelled as I exploded inside her.</p><p>As I collapsed on top of her, I let go of her wrists. She wrapped her arms around me and held me tight. I lifted my head and kissed her on the lips.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize that we made it through a full round of sex without one whimper from our daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Wasn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt sure was, baby.\u201d</p><p>As my lips traced her jawline, we heard Julia whimper. We looked at the monitor and saw her stirring in her crib. I started to get up from the bed when Ellery grabbed my arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo check on Julia,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? She\u2019s only whimpering. Maybe she\u2019s having a nightmare about you chasing all her boyfriends away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Ellery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Connor. She\u2019ll be fine. If she starts to scream, then we\u2019ll get her, but until then, she\u2019s just probably trying to get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>I pulled on my boxers and lay back in bed. \u201cYou\u2019re right, babe,\u201d I said as I wrapped my arms around her and stared at my daughter through the monitor.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Ellery</p><p>One month later...</p> <p>Ashlyn\u2019s trial had been going on for about three weeks, and Connor was under a lot of stress. Julia had started to sleep through the night, so that made things a little easier for us. Connor and I worked out at the gym every morning before he went to the office, and Mason watched Julia. He was so good with her, and it was easy to see how much he loved her. Landon confided in me that he was happy that we hired Mason as Julia\u2019s nanny because all Mason had been talking about in California was adopting a baby, and Landon wasn\u2019t ready for that kind of responsibility yet. So, taking care of Julia had kept Mason busy enough to get his baby fill.</p><p>It was a typical morning. Mason was downstairs with Julia. I was putting on my workout clothes and Connor was getting his things together for work. He seemed really on edge this morning, and it was bothering me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget we have Camden\u2019s birthday party this weekend at your parents\u2019 house,\u201d I said casually to him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can make it. With this trial and everything, I\u2019m behind at the office, so I may have to work all weekend.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his waist. \u201cCamden will be crushed if you\u2019re not there, and you\u2019ve never missed anything.\u201d</p><p>He took a hold of my arms and removed them from his waist. \u201cDon\u2019t start with me, Ellery. I\u2019ve got a lot going on right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me, Connor!\u201d I snapped.</p><p>I sighed and walked out of the room. I didn\u2019t want to start my day off with an argument, and I needed to get to the gym because I was meeting Peyton for fittings and lunch. I went downstairs and into the kitchen. I grabbed my bag and kissed Julia goodbye.</p><p>\u201cMason, tell Connor that I already left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, all right, Elle. Have a good day,\u201d he said.</p><p>I took the elevator down and when the doors opened, Denny was standing there.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go, Ellery? Where\u2019s Connor?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWho cares, and I\u2019m taking a cab. Bye, Denny,\u201d I said as I stepped onto the sidewalk and hailed a cab.</p><p>I was on the treadmill in the gym, listening to my iPod, when Connor stepped on the treadmill next to me.</p> <p>\u201cYou never cease to amaze me. I hope you know that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSorry, can\u2019t hear you. Music\u2019s playing,\u201d I said loudly.</p><p>\u201cEllery, take out the damn ear phones.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and took them out. \u201cThere. Happy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as he ran on the treadmill. \u201cWhy the hell would you not wait for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were being an ass and giving me an attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I said was that I didn\u2019t think I was going to be able to make it to Camden\u2019s party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me not to start with you in an irritated tone. So, I left because I didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you weren\u2019t bothering me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not talking to me. I know you\u2019re not telling me things, and it\u2019s eating you up inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss this any further right now, especially here,\u201d he said.</p><p>I shook my head, and I got off the treadmill. \u201cFine. I\u2019m going over to the spin bike.\u201d</p><p>I walked across to the other side of the gym where a row of spin bikes sat. I knew Connor wouldn\u2019t come over there because he hated the spin bikes. He was irritating me with his attitude and not wanting to talk about the trial. I could understand him being upset and trying to protect me, but he needed to understand that I didn\u2019t need protecting. I was a big girl and I could handle it. What I couldn\u2019t handle was him neglecting his family.</p><p>I stayed on the bike for about forty-five minutes, and then I looked around for Connor. I went to his usual machines but he wasn\u2019t around. I saw Toby, one of the personal trainers, and asked him if he\u2019d seen Connor. He said he that he\u2019d left already. My blood started to boil as anger shot through my body. I couldn\u2019t believe that he left without saying goodbye. I stomped off to the locker room, grabbed my phone from my locker, and quickly sent him a text message.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an a**hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d he replied.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. I didn\u2019t have time for this. I needed to shower quickly and meet Peyton down the street in less than an hour. After I finished getting dressed, I packed up my bag and left the gym. When I walked out the door, I saw Denny leaning up against the limo. I couldn\u2019t help but smile at this all-too-familiar sight.</p><p>\u201cDenny, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust seeing if you need a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I\u2019m meeting Peyton down the street.\u201d I smiled as I started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cEllery!\u201d Denny called out.</p><p>I stopped, turned around, and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know that you and Julia are the things that matters most to Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Denny,\u201d I said as I looked down.</p><p>\u201cHe may not always be right, but he loves you more than his own life, and he would do anything to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Tears began to fill my eyes as I looked up to keep them from falling. I walked over to where Denny was standing, and I gave him a hug.</p><p>\u201cI love him more than life too,\u201d I whispered in his ear.</p><p>Denny kissed me on the cheek and smiled. \u201cGo on and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Smiling back, I turned away and walked down the street to the caf\u00e9 where I was meeting Peyton. Upon arrival, I stepped inside and saw her sitting down at a table.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. What took you so long?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUgh. I\u2019ve had a bad morning, thanks to my husband,\u201d I said as I dug for my phone in my purse.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do? He\u2019s too perfect to cause you to have a bad day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, I need to text him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted you to know that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an a**hole and I love you.\u201d</p><p>Within seconds, a reply from him came through. \u201cI love you too and we\u2019ll talk when I get home. See if Mason can watch Julia tonight and we\u2019ll go out; just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElle, what\u2019s wrong? You look like you\u2019re stressed,\u201d Peyton said as she pushed a cup of coffee towards me.</p><p>\u201cConnor\u2019s been under a lot of pressure with this trial, and he\u2019s been uptight and irritable lately. I need to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>I had the idea in my head that if I went to the jail and paid a visit to Ashlyn that maybe we could talk, woman to woman, and I could convince her to change her plea. I know, wishful thinking, but it was worth a try.</p><p>\u201cAre you busy tomorrow?\u201d I asked as I looked at Peyton.</p><p>\u201cNo, why? What are you planning to do?\u201d she asked with knitted eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI want to go to the jail and pay Ashlyn a little visit.\u201d</p><p>Peyton\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAre you f**king crazy?!\u201d she voiced rather loudly.</p><p>\u201cPeyton! Keep your voice down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but you\u2019re crazy. Connor will kill you, Elle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle Connor, and he won\u2019t know anyway. I just want to pay a friendly visit, woman to woman.\u201d</p><p>Peyton kept shaking her head. I knew she didn\u2019t agree with me, but she was the only person I could trust.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Ellery. I\u2019ll go with you, but I don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>We got up from our seats and headed to the bridal shop for our fitting. As I saw Peyton step out of the dressing room in her wedding dress, my eyes began to fill with tears. She looked stunning, and it reminded me of the day Connor and I were married. I hated the way we left things, and I needed to stop by Black Enterprises to see him. As the tailor was pinning my dress, I called Mason to check on Julia. I missed her terribly.</p><p>\u201cHello, doll face. If you\u2019re calling about the princess, she\u2019s wonderful. We\u2019re getting ready to go to the park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mason. I\u2019m calling to see if you could babysit her tonight while Connor and I go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can. I\u2019ll watch her at my place and then Landon can have some Julia time too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be home in a while,\u201d I said as I hung up.</p><p>I told Peyton we needed to stop at Connor\u2019s office for a minute because I needed to pick something up. She gave me a look of disbelief. I never could pull anything over on her. We stepped off the elevator and headed down the hallway towards Connor\u2019s office. Valerie was sitting at her desk.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ellery.\u201d She smiled as she looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Valerie. Is he in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. Do you want me to tell him you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll surprise him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in a mood today,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know he is,\u201d I said as I put my hand on the handle. \u201cPeyton, I\u2019ll only be a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>I slowly turned the handle and opened the door. Connor was looking down at some papers.</p><p>\u201cValerie, I thought I gave strict instructions that I didn\u2019t want to be bothered,\u201d he said in an irritated tone without looking up.</p><p>\u201cEven for your wife?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Connor looked up and a smile lit up his face. He got up from his desk and walked towards me. I subtly locked the office door and met him halfway across the room. As I approached him, he wrapped his arms tightly around me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just needed to hug you and tell you that I\u2019m sorry for everything that happened today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, there\u2019s no need to apologize. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry,\u201d he said as he rubbed his cheek through my hair. \u201cWhere\u2019s Peyton? I thought you had plans with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s waiting outside the office. I told her I\u2019d be quick.\u201d I smiled as I started to unbuckle his belt.</p><p>Connor\u2019s smile grew as he looked at me. \u201cMake up sex, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, and I can\u2019t wait until tonight,\u201d I said as I unbuttoned his pants, took them down, and pushed him on the couch.</p><p>He sat there staring at me as I did a little strip dance. \u201cOh, God, Elle.\u201d</p><p>As I smiled and climbed on top of him, he grabbed my h*ps and gently eased me down onto him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already so wet,\u201d he whispered as he took my nipple in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you do to me, babe. You don\u2019t even have to touch me. Your looks are more than enough.\u201d</p><p>As I began to slowly thrust my h*ps back and forth, Connor threw his head back and a soft moan came from the back of his throat. He was so hard as I moved my h*ps around in a circular motion, slowly and fluently. He took his hand and reached down for my clit. I grabbed it as I looked at him and winked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPut your hands behind your head, Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad girl, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fully intend to be.\u201d I smiled as I reached over.</p><p>As I held onto his wrists, my br**sts brushed up against his face. He moaned as he took turns sucking each nipple. Reaching one hand behind me, I softly caressed his balls as his body tightened.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby, I can\u2019t hold it anymore,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Suddenly, I felt a warm sensation shoot into my body as I dug my nails into him and released myself all over him.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Ellery, you\u2019re making me want to come again.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>As I buried my face into his neck and tried to catch my breath, he whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re f**king amazing.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and kissed him on the lips as I put my hands on each side of his face. \u201cNow, I can go about my day.\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>He laughed and shook his head as I got off of him. I stood up and quickly pulled on my clothes. As I walked to the door, I put my hand on the handle, stopped, and turned around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bill you for services rendered.\u201d I winked as I walked out the door.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>When I arrived home after my day with Peyton, I was surprised that Mason and Julia weren\u2019t home from the park yet. As I pulled out my phone, a text message from Mason came through.</p><p>\u201cPrincess and I made a Starbucks run. Be home in five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better have an iced latte in hand when you walk through the door,\u201d I replied.</p> <p>When I walked into the kitchen to grab a bottle of water, I saw Denny on the phone, sitting at the table. He instantly hung up when he saw me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Denny. What\u2019s up?\u201d I asked casually.</p><p>\u201cNot much, Ellery. How was your day with Peyton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fine,\u201d I replied as I took a bottle of water from the refrigerator.</p><p>He seemed to be nervous. Almost as if he had just gotten caught doing something or he was afraid that I had heard something while he was on the phone. When I heard the elevator doors open, I ran out of the kitchen and straight to Julia. I smiled as I unbuckled her and held her tight.</p><p>\u201cOne iced latte for you, my dear.\u201d Mason smiled as he handed me the cup.</p><p>\u201cThank you, darling. How was Julia today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlamorous and perfect, like always. You should have seen the people at the park going crazy over her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she\u2019s her daddy\u2019s girl.\u201d I smiled as I held her and kissed her cheek.</p><p>I told Mason that Connor and I would be dropping her off at his place around seven o\u2019clock. He smiled, kissed her goodbye, and stepped onto the elevator. As I was walking up the stairs with Julia, Denny emerged from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDid you work things out with Connor?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI sure did.\u201d I winked.</p><p>He rolled his eyes and smiled as he left the penthouse.</p><p>I laid Julia down in the center of our king-sized bed as I got ready for my date with Connor. While I was in my closet looking for something to wear, I heard Connor walk into the bedroom. He walked over to the bed and sat down next to Julia. The moment she saw him, her little legs started moving all around.</p><p>\u201cLook at how excited she is to see her daddy.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame her. I get excited when I see her daddy too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElle, don\u2019t say things like that,\u201d he warned with a smile.</p><p>I walked over to him. Julia had her hand clasped around his finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still thinking about our little office romp,\u201d I whispered as I wrapped my arms around him and kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cGod, baby, I am too.\u201d He smiled as he turned his head and his lips brushed against mine.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere you want to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about something lately, and I want to talk to you about it.\u201d</p><p>As I pulled my jeans from the drawer, a sick feeling overtook me because I was afraid to hear what he\u2019d been thinking about.</p><p>\u201cI want to get a tattoo, and I was thinking we could go to the place where you got yours.\u201d</p><p>My eyes lit up as I turned around and looked at him. \u201cAre you serious? What kind of tattoo do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that you\u2019re pleasantly surprised by the idea.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI want something with yours and Julia\u2019s names on it, but leave enough room in case we have another child.\u201d</p><p>While pulling up my jeans, I stopped midway and looked at him. \u201cAnother child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why not? Let\u2019s make us a four-person family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about this again in about two years, Connor. I\u2019m not ready to even think about having another baby yet, especially with the problems I had while I was in labor with Julia.\u201d</p><p>As I finished pulling up my jeans, he got up from the bed, walked over to me, and put his hands on my hips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; I don\u2019t want a baby now. I was just thinking in the future,\u201d he said as he kissed me on the head.</p><p>\u201cHow about if we go out to dinner first and then we\u2019ll go see Jack about that tattoo you want to get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good, sweetheart. I\u2019m going to take a quick shower and then we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Julia started fussing, so I picked her up from the bed and took her downstairs. As I was warming up a bottle, I heard my phone chime. I picked it up from the counter and saw that I had a text message from Cassidy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going on a date tonight with Ben! I\u2019m so nervous, Elle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Cass. Don\u2019t be nervous. You\u2019ll have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been on a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust relax and be yourself. Call me tomorrow and let me know how it went.\u201d</p><p>Just as I hit the send button, Connor came walking into the kitchen and took Julia from me.</p><p>\u201cLet me finish feeding her. I missed her today.\u201d</p><p>Connor sat down in the chair and couldn\u2019t stop smiling at Julia as he held the bottle in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cCassidy just texted me, and she\u2019s going on a date with Ben tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you serious?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m serious, and what\u2019s your problem? Your sister deserves to be happy.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I want nothing more than for Cassidy to find the man of her dreams that will come in and sweep her off her feet and make her happy, but I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll get hurt because of Camden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Camden? Why?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause of his autism. It\u2019s going to take a pretty special guy to get involved with my sister under those circumstances. Not a lot of guys want to jump into a relationship like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Ben is that special guy.\u201d I smiled as I got up from the chair and grabbed the diaper bag.</p><p>\u201cDoubt it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed as I looked over at Connor. \u201cAre you still being pissy because I said he was hot?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t look at me and he had a smirk on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re holding Julia, because if you weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I weren\u2019t, then what, Ellery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d I smiled as I walked out of the kitchen and into the living room to get Julia\u2019s blanket.</p><p>Before I knew it, Connor had followed me. He laid Julia down on her blanket, which was on the floor and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cIf I weren\u2019t ... what?\u201d He smiled as he began moving towards me.</p><p>I started to back up as I bit down on my bottom lip. Once again, his look, his walk, his whole demeanor\u2014I knew all too well. I ran up the stairs, but before I could make it, Connor grabbed me from behind and carried me back down.</p><p>\u201cNow, tell me again what you were going to do to me if I wasn\u2019t holding Julia?\u201d he whispered in a sexy voice that sent shivers down my spine.</p><p>His grip on me was tight, and he wouldn\u2019t let me go. I didn\u2019t want him to let me go. When he held me, I felt safe from the world and all my worries disappeared. He put me down, but continued to hold me from behind. I could tell he didn\u2019t want to let go as he buried his face into my neck. Finally, I broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay, baby,\u201d I whispered as I freed my arm and brought my hand to the back of his head.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Connor</p><p>I held onto Ellery, and Julia started to fuss on the floor. I removed her hand from the back of my head and placed her palm against my lips.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get Julia packed up and ready to go,\u201d I said.</p><p>As I walked over and picked her up, Ellery got the diaper bag ready. I put Julia in the car seat and we stepped onto the elevator. We dropped Julia off with Mason and Landon and headed out for dinner.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go for dinner?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Shake Shack,\u201d she replied.</p><p>I looked at her as I twisted my face. \u201cThe what, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Shake Shack, silly! We can get burgers and shakes, plus it\u2019s right by Jack\u2019s Tattoo Parlor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds dirty and greasy.\u201d</p><p>Ellery laughed as she cocked her head at me. \u201cYou\u2019re so adorable. Now, let\u2019s go. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and we headed to the Shake Shack. As I sat there, eating my grilled chicken sandwich, Ellery shoved her burger in my face.</p><p>\u201cHere, taste this. It\u2019s the best burger in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. It looks greasy and disgusting,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself, Mr. Black. I remember a time when you would taste anything I shoved in your face.\u201d</p><p>I sat there and stared at her as she ate her burger and fries. I was mesmerized by how adorable she was, eating that burger full of grease. I couldn\u2019t resist her, so I gave in.</p><p>\u201cBring it here, and let me taste it,\u201d I said as I held out my hand.</p><p>A smile spread across her face. The one thing that I loved most about her was that the littlest things made her happy. I took a bite as she held it up to me and was pleasantly surprised that it was good.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it! I knew you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>We finished up dinner, if that\u2019s what you wanted to call it, and headed out the door. The tattoo parlor was a couple of blocks over, and Ellery wanted to walk. I took her hand in mine and we headed to the parlor. We were walking down the street and looking in the various shop windows as we passed by, when Ellery suddenly stopped.</p><p>\u201cHi, Elle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Kyle,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cConnor.\u201d He nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cKyle.\u201d I nodded back.</p><p>He introduced us to his girlfriend and asked Ellery how she was doing. She pulled out her phone and showed him pictures of Julia. I was uncomfortable and just wanted to get the hell out of there. I could see by the way he looked at her that he still had feelings for her. We said our goodbyes and continued walking down the street.</p><p>\u201cThat was awkward,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I\u2019ve run into him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have? You\u2019ve never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was no big deal. Just a quick \u2018hi\u2019 in passing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can tell he still has feelings for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well. His loss, right?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby, his loss and my gain. If he never would\u2019ve left you, I never would\u2019ve met you, and who knows where I\u2019d be right now?\u201d</p><p>She squeezed my hand lightly as we stood in front of Jack\u2019s Tattoo Parlor.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure. I\u2019ve never been surer about anything in my life, except for you.\u201d I winked at her.</p><p>As we walked through the door of the parlor, Jack looked up from behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cWell, look who decided to drop by; my girl, Ellery.\u201d He smiled as he stepped out from behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jack,\u201d Ellery said as she gave him a hug. \u201cI want you to meet my husband, Connor. He wants to get a tattoo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, Connor, nice to meet you, bro,\u201d Jack said as we shook hands. \u201cTake a seat right over here and tell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about the double infinity symbol in thick black ink, with Ellery\u2019s name at the top and Julia\u2019s name at the bottom. I want it on my right bicep.\u201d</p><p>Ellery looked at me, grabbed my hand, and I could see the tears swell in her eyes. I shook my head at her lightly.</p><p>\u201cSounds good, buddy. Are you ready? Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cAs ready as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>As Jack was halfway into the infinity design, I asked Ellery how she handled getting the tattoos on both wrists.</p> <p>\u201cI was in a very bad place and nothing could hurt worse than the pain I\u2019d felt from losing you.\u201d</p><p>I took in a sharp breath because my heart ached when she said that.</p><p>\u201cEllery was a good sport. She didn\u2019t even flinch,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a strong woman.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Two hours later, and my tat was finished. I looked at it through the mirror and it was exactly what I wanted.</p><p>\u201cConnor, it looks great! I love it!\u201d Ellery exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jack. You did a great job,\u201d I said as I pulled out my wallet and Ellery grabbed it out of my hand.</p><p>\u201cHere, Jack. Thank you for everything.\u201d She smiled as she handed him the money, plus a hundred-dollar tip.</p> <p>I looked at her as she looped her arm in mine and we walked out the door. \u201cWhat is with you giving people such large tips?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe deserved it. Look at the wonderful job he did on your tattoo. I must say that I\u2019m very turned on by it,\u201d she said as a wide grin graced her face.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, it was worth it.\u201d</p><p>We walked down the streets of the city and back to the Range Rover. Ellery pulled out her phone and sent a text message to Mason, telling him that we were on our way to get Julia. As we reached the garage where the Range Rover was parked, I opened the door for Ellery and kissed her passionately before letting her get in.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d she asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cJust because I love you, and I want to have sex right here and right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? In the parking garage?\u201d she asked as her teeth slid across her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cYep, right here, in our SUV, in the parking garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a kinky man, Connor, but what if someone sees us?\u201d</p><p>I leaned closer into her and traced her jaw line with my finger. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to see us, baby; the windows are tinted.\u201d</p><p>She reached her hand down and felt my erection through the fabric of my pants as I reached for her br**sts from underneath her shirt. She moaned and closed her eyes when my bare fingers touched her n**ples.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather do it here, without the risk of Julia disturbing us?\u201d I whispered as my tongue softly licked the tender spot behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cBackseat, and I\u2019m on top,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to argue with you,\u201d I said as I opened the back passenger\u2019s door and we both climbed in.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Ellery</p><p>A couple of days later, as I was getting Julia dressed, my phone rang. I reached over, grabbed it from the bed, and saw it was Sal from the art gallery.</p><p>\u201cHi Sal,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ellery. My brother is opening up a large art gallery in Chicago, and he wants you to be a part of it. He was going to call you, but I told him to hold off until I talked to you first. His art show is going to be big, and he has a lot of influential people and critics attending. This could be a big break for you as an artist. He said he wants at least five of your new paintings to showcase.\u201d</p><p>My heart began beating with excitement as I said yes right away. The thought of painting again thrilled me.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sal. Tell your brother to call me and that I\u2019m very excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Ellery, and congratulations. I know you\u2019ll do fantastic,\u201d he said as he hung up.</p><p>I picked up Julia and did a little happy dance with her. I hadn\u2019t painted since before she was born, and I missed it. Connor had already left for the office, and I was dying to tell him about the phone call from Sal, so I decided that we\u2019d stop by his office after we picked up Camden\u2019s birthday gift. When I took Julia downstairs, Claire took her from me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Ellery.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Claire. Can you keep an eye on Julia for me while I finish getting ready? We\u2019re going to go shopping today for Camden\u2019s birthday and then we\u2019re going to pay a surprise visit to Connor.\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled as she looked down at Julia. \u201cOf course I can keep an eye on this little doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Claire. I won\u2019t be too long.\u201d</p><p>As Denny was driving Julia and me to FAO Schwarz to meet Cassidy, his phone rang. He looked at it and then at me through the rearview mirror. I found it odd that he didn\u2019t answer it. A few seconds later, his phone rang again.</p><p>\u201cYou better get that. It may be important,\u201d I said.</p><p>He picked up his phone and answered it. He kept watching me through the mirror. He didn\u2019t offer much to the conversation except a few \u201cOkays.\u201d This was the second time he had behaved strangely with a phone call while I was around. I was beginning to think that something was going on that he didn\u2019t want me to know about. I decided not to ask him about it just yet.</p><p>Denny pulled up to the curb and Cassidy was waiting outside the store for us. She walked around, opened the door, and took Julia from her car seat. After I thanked Denny for his help, he said goodbye and drove away.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear all about your date with Ben,\u201d I said as the man dressed as a toy soldier held the door open for us.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lot of fun. Not only is he hot, but he\u2019s funny too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I remember him being on the funny side.\u201d I smiled. \u201cConnor was upset that I said he was hot.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cTell Connor he has nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did, but he wants to be the only hot man in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he does. He\u2019s madly in love with you. But the weird thing is, I didn\u2019t think he was the jealous type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quickly put his fears to rest.\u201d I winked.</p><p>Cassidy and I walked around the store for over two hours. Julia had just woken up and she was starting to get fussy. When I stopped the stroller and took her out of it, Cassidy lightly touched my arm. I looked over at her as she stared ahead. My eyes diverted over to where she was looking, and I saw my husband standing there, next to the big piano, with a wide smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I smiled as I walked over to him and he took Julia from my arms.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to take my three favorite girls to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so, now I\u2019m one of your favorite girls?\u201d Cassidy asked him as she kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been my favorite sister.\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cJulia and I were going to surprise you and come to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like I surprised you first,\u201d Connor said as he kissed my lips.</p><p>Cassidy walked over and stepped onto the big piano with one foot. \u201cConnor, do you remember when we were kids?\u201d she asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI sure do. Mom and Dad used to bring us here, and the both of us would try to play a song on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome play with me; just for fun. Like we used to,\u201d she said as she held out her hand.</p><p>There was nothing I wanted more than to see Connor playing on the big piano, but there was no way he was going to do it. As he handed Julia to me, he took Cassidy\u2019s hand and stepped onto the toy with her. I stood there in shock. He took two steps to the left as she took two steps to the right. I put Julia in her stroller and pulled out my phone. This was something that I never wanted to forget, I thought as I hit the video record button. As Cassidy stepped off the piano, Connor stepped a little tune. When he was finished, Cassidy stepped on and played the same tune. Both of them were smiling and laughing. It was so good to see Connor having fun and relax a bit. They were both out of breath when they finished. Cassidy walked past me and I high-fived her. As Connor walked up to me, he wrapped his arms around me tightly and swayed me back and forth.</p><p>\u201cYou looked really sexy doing that.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cWe used to come here all the time. Sometimes when Cassidy and I would be playing on it, one of the other keys would light up that we didn\u2019t step on, and I\u2019d tell her that Collin was here playing with us. It sort of freaked her out.\u201d</p><p>I broke our embrace and put my hand on his chest. \u201cI bet he was here. He\u2019s always with you in spirit.\u201d</p><p>Connor smiled and kissed my head. \u201cCome on; let\u2019s go eat. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>While we stood in line, waiting to make our purchases, Connor took Julia from the stroller and held her up while making funny faces at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, look at Daddy Connor,\u201d I heard a voice from behind say.</p><p>Connor and I turned around and we saw Sarah standing there. Instantly, Connor became nervous.</p><p>\u201cSarah. How are you?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Connor. It\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d She smiled. \u201cEllery, you look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sarah,\u201d I replied as I watched her move closer to Julia.</p><p>Seeing her always put a sick feeling in my stomach. Just knowing how she and Connor had used each other for years, and the things they did, made me irritated, but not as bad as when I looked at Ashlyn.</p><p>\u201cEllery, she\u2019s adorable, and she looks just like you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled politely as she backed away. \u201cIt was good seeing both of you again. You\u2019re a perfect little family, and I would be lying if I didn\u2019t say that I was jealous. Have a good day,\u201d she said as she walked away.</p><p>Cassidy looked at me and then looked at Connor. She didn\u2019t say a word and neither did he. Suddenly, I blurted out, \u201cWell, that was awkward.\u201d</p><p>Connor put Julia in her stroller, stood behind me, and whispered in my ear, \u201cLike it was awkward running into Kyle.\u201d</p><p>I looked around and saw that Cassidy was making her purchase. I discreetly reached my hand back and placed it on Connor\u2019s crotch, giving it a light squeeze. I leaned my head back and whispered, \u201cHe was my boyfriend, not my f**k buddy. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Connor placed his hand on mine as I released my light grip. \u201cBaby, that\u2019s not nice, and we\u2019ll discuss it when we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet we\u2019ll discuss it when we get home; just not with words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I paid for Camden\u2019s birthday gifts and the four of us walked out of the store. As Connor pushed the stroller, I looped my arm around his and smiled.</p> <p>While we were waiting for our food to be served, I asked Connor how he knew we were at FAO Schwarz.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you told me last night you were going there, and when I talked to Denny, he said he\u2019d just dropped you and Julia off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we had already been in there for over two hours. How did you know we were still in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took my chances, Ellery. What\u2019s with the million questions?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and apologized. Something wasn\u2019t sitting right with me, and I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God! I completely forgot to tell you, Connor!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason Julia and I were coming to see you at the office. Sal called me and his brother is opening an art gallery in Chicago, and he wants me to do a showing with five of my paintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news, Ellery.\u201d Cassidy smiled.</p><p>\u201cBaby, that\u2019s wonderful. I don\u2019t think you have five paintings done, do you?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>I looked down as the waitress set my club sandwich down in front of me. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I need to start painting, and quick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the opening?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>As I gave her a perplexed look, I bit down on my bottom lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I was so excited, I forgot to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d Connor smiled as he leaned over and kissed me.</p><p>While eating our lunch, we talked about Camden\u2019s party and then Cassidy had to go and say something she shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cBen\u2019s coming to Camden\u2019s party.\u201d</p><p>Julia began to whine, so I reached over and took her from her stroller. I didn\u2019t want to look at Connor because I knew he was going to be pissed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that look, Connor. I\u2019ll have you know that he\u2019s a very nice guy, and I like him. In fact, we\u2019re going out tonight, with Camden.\u201d</p><p>Connor leaned across the table. \u201cYou\u2019re letting him into Camden\u2019s life?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like him and, from what I can tell, he likes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know about Camden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he does! Do you think I would hide that from him?\u201d</p><p>Putting my hand on Connor\u2019s arm to try and diffuse the situation didn\u2019t help. Cassidy stood up and threw some money on the table.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d better leave before you or I say something we\u2019ll regret. Ellery, I love you and we\u2019ll talk later,\u201d she said as she kissed me on the cheek.</p><p>She walked out of the restaurant, and I looked at Connor. \u201cAre you happy now?\u201d</p><p>Connor shook his head and rolled his eyes. \u201cShe had no reason to get upset like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>By this point, Julia was tired and getting fussy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this now. I need to get Julia home for a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby girl,\u201d Connor said as he took her from me. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get mad at your daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait until she\u2019s a teenager and wants nothing to do with you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cEllery, don\u2019t say things like that,\u201d he said with a shocked looked on his face.</p><p>I smiled as we got up from our seats and walked out of the restaurant.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Connor</p><p>Denny was waiting for us outside the restaurant. Once we reached the limo, I handed Julia to Ellery and I folded up the stroller and put it in the trunk. Ellery buckled in Julia as I slid in and shut the door. When I looked over at her, she was staring at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do, Connor. Why would you start about Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about Ben. I simply asked if he knew about Camden. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave Cassidy a look of disgust when she told you he was going to be at the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I love my sister and Camden very much. She needs to be careful of who she brings into Camden\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Ellery said as she glared at me. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid that Camden will push a guy away and break your sister\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>As I looked out the window, I couldn\u2019t say anything. She was right. I only wanted Cassidy to be happy, but if Camden didn\u2019t like someone or felt threatened, he could be a handful. I didn\u2019t want my sister getting attached and then having her heart broken when the guy left because of him. Ellery reached over and grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I understand that you\u2019re concerned for Cassidy. Trust me, I don\u2019t want to see her or Camden get hurt either, but she\u2019s a grown woman and is capable of making her own decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s capable of making her own decisions, Ellery. I just don\u2019t want her to get hurt. I\u2019ve always protected her and Camden, and I\u2019m not about to stop now because some guy wants a piece of ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor!\u201d Ellery snapped. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that.\u201d</p><p>As Denny pulled into the parking garage, I opened the door and took out Julia\u2019s car seat. Ellery grabbed the diaper bag and followed me into the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I said that. Maybe I didn\u2019t mean it. Hell, I don\u2019t know what I meant. I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens. But I promise you this: if he hurts her, he\u2019ll have me to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Ellery looked over at me and smiled. \u201cOr me, and I\u2019m not really sure which one of us is worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that would be you, my love.\u201d I smiled as I stepped off the elevator.</p><p>Ellery slapped me on the ass for that comment, and I felt a twinge below. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Black. I have a baby\u2019s diaper to change.\u201d</p><p>While Ellery took Julia upstairs to change her diaper, I went into my office. A few moments later, Denny came in, shut the door, and sat down.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell Ellery about Ashlyn?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I have to. I\u2019m keeping her in the loop about the trial and she seems content with that. I don\u2019t want to upset her any more than she already is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you promised her no secrets, Connor, and this classifies as a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t focus on Ashlyn and the trial anymore. She\u2019s going to be doing a showing at an art gallery in Chicago, and they need five paintings. She needs to focus on that without any distractions. Between painting and Julia, she\u2019ll be too busy even to think about Ashlyn and the trial.\u201d</p><p>Denny sat there and shook his head at me. \u201cWill you ever learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what you\u2019re doing about what?\u201d Ellery asked as she opened the door and stood there.</p><p>I had to think fast or she\u2019d start asking a million questions. \u201cDamn it, Ellery. You ruined the surprise,\u201d I said.</p><p>Denny glared at me. I held out my arms for her and told her to come sit on my lap.</p><p>\u201cDenny and I were just talking about your art studio.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>A beautiful smile graced her face as she looked at me. \u201cWhat art studio?\u201d</p><p>As I glanced over at Denny. He rolled his eyes. \u201cThe one I\u2019m building you so you can paint.\u201d</p><p>Ellery threw her arms around my neck and hugged me. \u201cConnor, I\u2019m so excited! So tell me about this studio of mine!\u201d she said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Connor, tell Ellery your plans for the studio,\u201d Denny said smugly.</p><p>\u201cWe can discuss it later,\u201d I said as I tapped her on the nose and shot Denny at look. \u201cYou\u2019ll love it, but I have to finish something up. Please let me surprise you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you know how impatient I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know you are,\u201d I said as I heard Julia cry.</p><p>Thank God for Julia, I thought to myself. Ellery got up from my lap and walked out of the office. Denny got up from his chair and shook his head. \u201cYou better get moving on those plans for that art studio you just promised her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do that right now,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>I pulled out my phone and dialed Paul. It went to voicemail, so I left a message for him to call me back right away. He could locate a place for Ellery\u2019s art studio.</p><p>As I walked out of my office and passed the living room, I noticed Ellery sound asleep on the couch. I grabbed a blanket from the closet and gently covered her with it. I needed a scotch, so I walked over to the bar and poured myself one. The smoothness going down the back of my throat soothed me, as did the sight of my sleeping wife. My eyes gazed at her as my mind was punishing me for keeping something from her. A few moments later, she opened her eyes and looked at me from across the room.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. You were asleep when I came out of my office,\u201d I said as I walked over to her, sat down on the edge of the couch, and pushed a few strands of hair from her face.</p><p>When she sat up, she took the glass from my hand and took a sip. As always, she made the same face when she drank it.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you take a sip when you don\u2019t like Scotch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thirsty.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I leaned closer towards her and brushed her lips with mine. Her lips responded seductively as she hardened our kiss. Just as I laid her back and hovered over her, kissing her passionately, my phone rang. Taking in a sharp breath as I broke our kiss, I pulled my phone from my pocket and saw that Paul was calling.</p><p>\u201cBaby, we have to continue this later. I have to take this; it\u2019s Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Go ahead and take your call. I\u2019ll go check on Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Paul,\u201d I answered as I walked into my office and shut the door. \u201cI need you to find me a space that I can convert into an art studio for Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get on that right away, Connor. Do you have a certain area in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere close to the penthouse. I think she\u2019ll like it better if she\u2019s close to home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll call you when I locate something.\u201d</p><p>I had a good feeling about this art studio. It was something that I should\u2019ve done a long time ago, but with Ellery\u2019s illness, the wedding, and now Julia, she didn\u2019t really paint too much, and I didn\u2019t give it any thought. Perfection was what I needed the studio to be. It needed to be a distraction from the daily grind of the trial.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Ellery</p><p>As I picked up Julia from the changing table, my phone started to ring. I held her up over my shoulder and walked over to take it from where it was sitting on her dresser.</p><p>\u201cHi, Peyton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Elle. I thought we were going to see that bitch in jail.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe are. The day we talked about it was visiting day, so now we have to wait until next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh okay. I was just wondering because you were really adamant about going and then you never mentioned it again. I thought that maybe you\u2019d changed your mind. Actually, I was hoping you\u2019d changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Peyton, I haven\u2019t changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkie dokie, Elle. What are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStaring at my sexy husband as he\u2019s standing in the doorway. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>As I hit the end button, Connor walked over, took Julia, and sat in the rocking chair. My greatest love was watching my husband with his daughter. I took the new clothes I bought for Julia and hung them in the closet. My stomach tied itself in knots when Connor asked me a question.</p><p>\u201cWhat haven\u2019t you changed your mind about?\u201d</p><p>I stood facing the inside of the closet as I hung up the clothes one by one. My skin started to feel fiery and nerves set in. I needed to think of something fast.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I innocently asked.</p> <p>\u201cI heard you say to Peyton that you haven\u2019t changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. It was about going with her next week to look at flowers for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she think that you\u2019d change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t. She was just making sure that I didn\u2019t change my mind,\u201d I said as I looked at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t Henry be going with her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDid you go with me, Mr. Black?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood point.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Emerging from the rocking chair, he took Julia downstairs and put her in her swing. I followed behind as I let out a sigh of relief. If he ever found out that I was going to see Ashlyn, I didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do.</p><p>I picked up toys around the living room and put them in a basket, then walked to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. Connor came from behind and wrapped his strong arms around me, taking in my scent as his hot breath traveled down my neck. As I put my hands on his arms and tilted my head to the side, his lips began their journey across my skin.</p><p>\u201cI wish Mason was here right now to take Julia for a while so I could f**k you on this kitchen counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need Mason. You can still do it. Julia\u2019s being good in her swing. We may not have a lot of time, but we can certainly try.\u201d</p><p>A low growl developed in the back of his throat as he reached his hand between my thighs and started cupping me below. I quickly turned around to face him. He picked me up and set me on the counter while his hands made their way up my shirt and to my br**sts. I brought my hands to his head and ran my fingers through his hair. Our mouths devoured each other. Suddenly, we heard someone clear their throat. I jumped, and Connor looked across the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting something?\u201d Denny asked as he walked to the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Denny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRelax, Connor. Julia would have made sure you two didn\u2019t get any further.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his comment as I got off the counter and straightened my shirt. Just as I was about to say something, my phone rang. I looked over to where it was sitting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a call from Chicago. I bet it\u2019s Sal\u2019s brother. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I said as I walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllery?\u201d a male voice spoke.</p><p>\u201cYes, this is Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, this is Vinnie, Sal\u2019s brother. He said he was going to call you about my art gallery showing here in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Vinnie, Sal did call me, and I\u2019m very interested in doing a showing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Ellery. I\u2019ve seen your work and I think you\u2019re an amazing painter. Is there any way you can fly out to Chicago and we can meet for dinner to discuss the opening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. When would you like to meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sooner, the better. That way, you can get a feel for what I\u2019m expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can probably fly out tomorrow,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be great. Call me or send me a text to confirm, and I\u2019ll make reservations for dinner. I look forward to meeting you, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Vinnie. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Excitedly, I walked back to the kitchen, where Denny was holding Julia and Connor was sitting across from him.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flying to Chicago tomorrow to have dinner with Vinnie. So make sure the plane\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d Connor smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll clear my schedule for tomorrow and fly with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go, Connor. I know how busy you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going alone, end of discussion, Ellery,\u201d he said in a serious tone.</p><p>I looked over at Denny as he raised his eyebrows at me. When I slowly walked over to where Connor sat, he looked up from his phone at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, but if you ever take that tone with me again, I will hurt you. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>The corners of his mouth curved up into a sinister smile. \u201cThen I\u2019ll make sure to use that tone more often, especially in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr in the kitchen, if that\u2019s what you prefer,\u201d Denny chimed in.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh as I walked over and kissed Denny on the cheek.</p><p>After having the best sex with Connor, first in bed and then again in the shower, we packed a light bag, grabbed the diaper bag, put Julia in her car seat, and headed to Mason\u2019s loft to pick him up. Opening the door, he slid into the seat across from us and sat down next to Julia.</p><p>\u201cHello, princess! We\u2019re going to have so much fun in Chicago. Uncle Mason is going to take you to the American Girl store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think she\u2019s a little young for that?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cBite your tongue! You\u2019re never too young for those beautiful and fun dolls.\u201d</p><p>Once we arrived at the airport, we boarded Connor\u2019s plane and headed to Chicago. Upon arriving in the Windy City, we checked ourselves into the Trump Towers and headed to our rooms. Connor handed Mason a key to his own room. Mason looked at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI have my own room? Aren\u2019t nannies supposed to stay with the couple and their child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your own room where you can hang out with Julia when we need you to. Your bar is fully stocked with the best liquor, so please enjoy. But not while Julia\u2019s with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I told you how much I love you?\u201d Mason winked at him.</p><p>Stepping into the suite, I threw myself on the luxurious king-sized bed. Connor asked Mason to take Julia to his room while we got ready for dinner.</p><p>\u201cDinner isn\u2019t for a few hours,\u201d I said.</p><p>Connor walked towards the bed, unbuttoning his shirt. He slid it off and laid it across the chair. I stared at his sexy, ripped abs and shivers ran across my skin. He climbed on the bed and hovered over me while he gazed into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want to make love to you, Ellery Black; right here and right now. I want to touch and feel every inch of your bare skin, and I want to feel your excitement all over me. Then I want to take you into the bathtub and soap up your nak*d body while making love to you again.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. His effect on me was riveting, and I was already wet just from his words. He always made me feel like I was the only woman on Earth, and his constant hunger for me made my body tremble. I stared into his mesmerizing eyes as he slid his hand down my yoga pants, not stopping until he felt how aroused I was.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so wet, baby,\u201d he moaned as dipped his finger inside me.</p><p>I arched my back and threw back my head, begging for more as he ripped off my pants and tossed them on the floor.</p><p>While I freshened up my makeup and fixed my hair, Connor went and brought Julia and Mason back to the room. Mason walked into the bathroom and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cLook at your glowing face, Miss Ellery. You must\u2019ve had amazing sex.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t turn around. I looked at him through the mirror and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it. You knew we were going to when he had you take Julia to your room.\u201d</p><p>Mason took a few steps forward and leaned in closer to me. \u201cJust tell me one thing: is he as amazing in bed as he looks like he\u2019d be?\u201d</p><p>I knitted my eyebrows at him and then smiled. \u201cYes, and amazing doesn\u2019t even describe how skillful he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I knew it.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>\u201cStop dreaming about my husband and help me pick out a dress to wear.\u201d</p><p>As I walked over to the closet and looked at the four dresses I brought, Connor walked into the bedroom with Julia. He laid her down on the bed and dangled her animal keys in front of her. I looked over and smiled, then pulled the red dress and the blue dress from the closet.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d I asked as I held both dresses up.</p><p>\u201cThe blue one. The red one,\u201d both Connor and Mason said at the same time.</p><p>I looked at both of them with a twisted face. \u201cOkay, the black one it is,\u201d I said as I put the red and blue dresses back, and I pulled out the black one.</p><p>\u201cThank you, gentlemen. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a dress to put on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, black works,\u201d I heard Mason say as I walked into the bathroom and shut the door.</p><p>When I finished putting on my dress and black heels, I kissed Julia goodbye while Connor had his hand on the small of my back, pushing me out the door. We met Vinnie at a restaurant called Spiaggia. He had already arrived and stood up when the hostess showed us to the table.</p><p>\u201cEllery Black. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you,\u201d he said as he kissed me lightly on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you as well, Vinnie. This is my husband, Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>The two of them shook hands, then we took our seats and opened our menus.</p><p>\u201cI took the liberty of ordering us a bottle of their finest Pinot grigio. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Connor smiled.</p><p>After deciding what I wanted for dinner, I closed the menu and folded my hands on the table. \u201cSo, tell me about your art gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gallery is about ten thousand square feet. I would like to show you it tomorrow morning, if possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to fly back to New York in the morning. How about tonight, after dinner?\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, tonight will be fine.\u201d Vinnie smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe opening of the gallery will take place in forty-five days,\u201d Vinnie said. \u201cIs that something you can work with?\u201d</p><p>I took a sip of my wine and swallowed hard. I didn\u2019t know if I could do it. But I wasn\u2019t going to let him know that.</p><p>\u201cOf course I can work with that,\u201d I said as I took another sip of wine.</p><p>\u201cGreat. When we go and tour the unfinished gallery, I\u2019ll show you the space I have picked out for your paintings.\u201d</p><p>As we ate our fine cuisine and drank our wine, Connor and Vinnie mostly talked about the business aspect of the art gallery. I pulled out my phone and sent a text message to Mason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s my baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.

We\u2019re going to take a tour of the art gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hurry and have fun.\u201d</p> <p>After we toured the art gallery, Connor and I said goodbye to Vinnie and slid into the back seat of the limo that was waiting for us. Connor reached over and took my hand.</p><p>\u201cDid you like the gallery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved it. It\u2019s going to be amazing once it\u2019s finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be amazing when your paintings are hanging on the wall.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>After I kissed him on the cheek, I laid my head on his shoulder while I was worried about whether or not I\u2019d be able to finish all five paintings in time. When I was single, the worry would never have crossed my mind. But now that I was a wife and a mother, it was going to be difficult, even with Connor\u2019s and Mason\u2019s help. I took in a deep breath as Connor kissed me on my head.</p> <p>Chapter 19</p><p>Connor</p><p>After we had a nice breakfast, we flew back to New York. I had Denny drop me off at Black Enterprises so I could catch up on business before he drove Ellery, Julia, and Mason home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, baby,\u201d I said as I kissed Ellery and then Julia goodbye.</p><p>\u201cBye, sweetheart. Don\u2019t work too hard.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door and walked into the building. As I stepped onto the elevator, my phone rang. It was Paul.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way up to see you. I\u2019m in the elevator.\u201d</p><p>When the elevator doors opened, I walked down the hallway to Paul\u2019s office. I opened the door and sat down across from him.</p><p>\u201cI found a place for Ellery\u2019s art studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat; where\u2019s it at?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIn your building.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him in confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean, in my building? What building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you live, Connor,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>I knitted my eyebrows while I got up and walked over to his coffee pot. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s such a good idea. I wanted it outside of the building.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, Connor. It\u2019s perfect, and I think she\u2019d love it. It\u2019s on the tenth floor, and it\u2019s the end apartment. It has more windows for natural light, kitchen, bathroom, and a bedroom, which can be converted into a storage room. She\u2019ll have everything she needs there and, most importantly, it\u2019s safe. I know how you are with her about safety.\u201d</p><p>I stood there, sipped my coffee, and nodded my head. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll go have a look at it before I head home. Thanks, Paul,\u201d I said as I walked out and headed to my office.</p><p>Later in the day, I decided to call Cassidy. I dialed her number and waited patiently for her to answer. I wasn\u2019t sure if she would or not, considering how we left things the other day.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re calling to harass me about my love life, save it,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a clever way to answer the phone. I take it you\u2019re still pissed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissed isn\u2019t a strong enough word, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the other day. I really am. Now, if you\u2019ll forgive me, then I can tell you the reason I\u2019m calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call to apologize?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, that too, but I also wanted to ask you for a favor.\u201d</p><p>I heard a long sigh on the other end. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at an apartment in my building to convert to an art studio for Ellery, and I would love for you to look at it with me. But please don\u2019t tell her; it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is good for you?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cHow about an hour?\u201d</p><p>I looked across my office and I saw the door open. Cassidy was standing in the doorway. I smiled and hung up the phone, getting up from my chair as she stepped into the office. I gave her a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sis. You know how much I love you and Camden, and I only want the best for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, Connor, and I love you too, but you can\u2019t think that you can rule my life. Let me fall. I\u2019ll get back up and try again. I\u2019m not as weak as you think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re weak at all.\u201d I smiled as I broke our embrace.</p><p>\u201cI have a couple of things to finish up in the other office and then we can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll call Denny to come pick us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. I have my car. You can just drive us there.\u201d She smiled as she left the office.</p><p>There was nothing I hated more than New York City traffic and she knew it. Perhaps it was her way of getting back at me.</p><p>Cassidy and I stepped into the apartment and, instantly, I knew it was perfect for Ellery.</p><p>\u201cI love it, Connor,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cShe\u2019ll love it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice. Tell me your vision for the place. Remember, it\u2019s to be an art studio.\u201d</p><p>As Cassidy walked around the apartment and showed me what she envisioned, I knew that Ellery was going to adore it. The more I thought about it, I knew that Paul was right. It was a lot safer here for Ellery to have an art studio, and I wouldn\u2019t have to worry so much about her. Pulling out my phone, I called the owner and bought the apartment. Cassidy and I walked out the door and, as I pushed the button to the elevator, I hugged Cassidy goodbye. The doors opened and I jumped when I saw Ellery standing inside the elevator.</p><p>\u201cConnor, Cassidy. What are you doing?\u201d she asked with a weird look on her face.</p><p>Fuck, I thought to myself. \u201cBaby, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I asked you first, Connor,\u201d she said as she stepped off the elevator. \u201cWhy are you on this floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d I said as I shook my head. I grabbed her hand. \u201cCome on; I\u2019ll show you the reason.\u201d</p><p>I opened the apartment door and motioned for her to step inside. \u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to your art studio.\u201d</p><p>A shocked expression overtook her face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms around her waist. \u201cThis is your art studio, baby. I bought it for you as a surprise and Cassidy is going to decorate it. This is where you\u2019ll come and do all your painting with no interruptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Connor, I love it! Thank you,\u201d she said as she kissed me.</p><p>She thanked Cassidy with a hug and then Cassidy announced she had to leave.</p><p>\u201cI need to get home. I still have a lot to do for Camden\u2019s party tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Ellery asked her if there was anything she could help her do. Cassidy politely said no and that she had everything under control. After she walked out of the apartment, Ellery shut the door and stood up against it with a smile on her face. I could tell she was up to something.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWe will, after we christen my new art studio.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I felt a twinge below when she said that. She walked over to where I was standing, grabbed the bottom of my shirt, and lifted it over my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give you a proper thank you, Mr. Black,\u201d she said as she unbuckled my belt.</p><p>I was grinning from ear to ear with that thought.</p><p>We pulled up to the long, winding driveway of my parents\u2019 house. The porch was decorated with balloons and a big sign that said Happy Birthday, Camden. Ellery and I both smiled when we saw the sign, knowing that, in the not-too-distant future, we\u2019d be doing the same for Julia. We stopped at our beach house first to drop off our bags and to check on things. It\u2019d been a while since we\u2019d been there because of everything that was going on. Mason and Landon were driving up for the party as well as Peyton and Henry, and Denny and his wife, Dana. I parked the Range Rover and unbuckled Julia\u2019s car seat. Ellery grabbed the diaper bag and Camden\u2019s gifts. As we walked into the house, Camden came running from the family room. I quickly put down the car seat as he ran into my arms.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, buddy,\u201d I said as I kissed his head. He smiled at me and then looked at Ellery and held his arms out to her. She set the gifts on the table and took him from me, hugging him and wishing him a happy birthday.</p><p>As Ellery took Julia from the car seat, Camden led me by the hand out to the backyard. All of our family and friends were there, laughing, talking, and having a good time. The minute my mother saw us, she ran over and took Julia from Ellery. As we made our rounds, Aunt Sadie came up to us and gave us both a hug. She took Ellery\u2019s hand and turned it over. I really hated when she was at family functions. As she looked at Ellery and smiled, she squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very healthy, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Aunt Sadie; that\u2019s good to know.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>Aunt Sadie asked Ellery to bend down and she whispered something in her ear. I watched as Ellery smiled and thanked her.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d I asked when Aunt Sadie walked away.</p><p>\u201cOh, she just told me that she sees a little boy in our future.\u201d She smiled as she hooked her arm around mine.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows at her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Aunt Sadie, we are.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>The thought of having a son thrilled me. A boy that I could groom to take over Black Enterprises like my dad did with me. I leaned over and kissed Ellery on the head.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust because I love you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she gave my arm a squeeze. We walked over to where Denny and Dana were sitting and took a seat next to them. It wasn\u2019t too long after I sat down that my father asked to see me. I followed him into the house and into his office, where he shut the door.</p><p>\u201cHow are things going with the trial, son?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I ran my hand through my hair as I walked over to the bar and poured a glass of scotch. \u201cIt\u2019s going like all trials go, Dad. I just wish this bullshit was over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got yourself into this mess, Connor. What the hell were you thinking, getting into a relationship with that whore?\u201d</p><p>I took in a sharp breath as I looked at him. \u201cI had my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said what those reasons were, and I want to know. I don\u2019t want my company dragged through the mud because you couldn\u2019t keep your dick in your pants.\u201d</p><p>His comment burned throughout my body. \u201cBlack Enterprises is my company now. I turned that company around when you weren\u2019t paying attention to it because you were off with your whore in the Caribbean and your accountant was robbing you blind,\u201d I spat through gritted teeth.</p><p>My father didn\u2019t know that I knew about the woman that he took to the Caribbean two years before I took over the company. He was supposed to be on a business trip for a month in Germany, at least that\u2019s what he told my mother. His accountant had embezzled money and his V.P. made some very bad business deals. My father turned around and wouldn\u2019t look at me as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou never told your mother about that. Why?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause, it would\u2019ve killed her and I didn\u2019t want to see her hurt. My relationship with Ashlyn was out of control. I was in a dark and bad place at that time. Thank God Ellery came into my life when she did. Listen, Dad, Lou has this under control. I don\u2019t want you to worry about it. Hopefully, it\u2019ll all be over soon.\u201d</p><p>As he turned around, he looked at me and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right, son, and I\u2019m sorry for what I said.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a small smile as he walked from behind his desk and patted me on the back. I opened the door and Ellery was standing there.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. I wondered where you had disappeared to,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Ellery. I had to steal my boy and go over a few things with him. Now where\u2019s that granddaughter of mine?\u201d My father smiled at her.</p><p>As we walked out to the backyard, we heard screaming. I looked over to my right and saw Camden on the ground, kicking and screaming at the top of his lungs. I started to go to him and Ellery grabbed my arm. \u201cConnor, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Just then, I saw Ben go over to him. He laid down on the ground next to him and made Camden look at him. He started making gestures with his hands and pointing up at the sky and told Camden to do the same. Ellery looked over at me and smiled as Camden instantly calmed down and did what Ben had asked. Everyone went about their business and continued to eat and talk amongst each other. Cassidy stared at me from across the yard. When I walked over to her, Ben and Camden got up from the ground and walked over to us.</p><p>\u201cThat was impressive, Ben,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMy brother is autistic and I practically raised him before I went off to college. My mom worked double shifts at the hospital and my dad took off when I was nine. Camden is a great kid.\u201d He smiled as he looked at Cassidy.</p> <p>At that moment, I saw something between them. Ellery walked over to and handed me Julia.</p><p>\u201cAdmit you were wrong about Ben,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong about Ben. He\u2019s a great guy.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Ellery</p><p>Connor seemed to be more on edge lately and more irritable. He would go to the courthouse every day and then to the office. He was coming home later than normal because he was behind on work. I did as much as I could to try and take the stress off of him. Even though my studio wasn\u2019t ready yet, I started painting and panic set in, as I was scared that I wouldn\u2019t be able to finish.</p> <p>It was ten o\u2019clock in the evening, and I had just put Julia to bed. As I sat down at my easel, I heard the elevator doors open.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so late. I had a lot of work to do,\u201d he slurred as he kissed me on the cheek and the stench of alcohol overtook my senses.</p><p>\u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI had a couple drinks,\u201d he said as he sat on the couch.</p><p>\u201cAt the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I stopped at the bar before I came home.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out on the couch and put his arm over his eyes. I got up from my seat and walked over to him. \u201cHow did you get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a cab.\u201d</p> <p>I was furious with him for not telling me that he was stopping at the bar before coming home. I was also mad at the fact that he didn\u2019t even come home to see Julia before she went to bed. This wasn\u2019t like him, and something else was going on.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t come home to spend some time with Julia before she went to bed?\u201d I asked with a raised voice.</p><p>He lifted his arm and looked at me. \u201cAre you pissed off or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m pissed off, Connor. You didn\u2019t tell me you were going to the bar after the office. I just assumed you were there working. Who did you go to the bar with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went with Paul. What\u2019s the big deal? Fuck, Ellery, you\u2019re pissing me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pissing you off? You come home at ten o\u2019clock at night, reeking of alcohol, and you expect me not to be upset? It would\u2019ve been different if you would\u2019ve called and told me.\u201d</p><p>Connor got up from the couch and headed towards the stairs. \u201cI don\u2019t need to explain my whereabouts to you, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>I stood there in shock as he walked up the stairs; this wasn\u2019t my husband. I decided it was best to leave him alone and let him sleep it off, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something else was going on. Taking my phone from the table, I dialed Peyton.</p><p>\u201cHello, sexy mama. Henry and I are about to have sex, so I need to make it quick,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you answer the phone, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s you, and what if it was important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor came home drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s not like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s this f**king trial and that bitch Ashlyn. I need to go and pay her a visit tomorrow and you\u2019re coming with me. Remember; don\u2019t say a word to Henry or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow for the fitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Peyton,\u201d I said as I hung up.</p><p>Turning off all the lights, I walked upstairs and checked on Julia before heading to the bedroom. Stepping into the shower, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Connor said to me, and it made me angry. The hot water streaming down my body felt good as I shampooed my hair. I didn\u2019t want to wake up Connor, so I didn\u2019t stay in the shower very long. As I stepped out, I was startled by him going to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Connor, you scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I just had to take a piss.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped the towel around me and as I went to step into the bedroom, Connor grabbed my arm and pulled me into him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I\u2019m sorry about tonight, and I\u2019m sorry for what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are, Connor. You\u2019re under a lot of pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no excuse, Ellery,\u201d he said as he kissed me. \u201cPlease let me make love to you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at his drunken words, and I nodded my head as he removed the towel from me, picked me up, and carried me to our bed.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to say to her when you see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I tried a million conversations in my head,\u201d I replied as we drove to the jail where Ashlyn was.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell Connor you were doing today?\u201d Peyton asked.</p><p>\u201cI told him that you and I were going for another fitting and then going to do some cake tasting.\u201d</p><p>I hated lying to him and it was killing me inside. But I didn\u2019t have a choice. I needed to try and save my family and, most importantly, my husband. I parked the Range Rover and walked the distance from the parking lot to the building. The clerk sitting behind the glass window asked me the name of the prisoner I was visiting. Once I gave him Ashlyn\u2019s name, he typed in the computer and then gave me a strange look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, but she was released from this facility a couple of weeks ago. She\u2019s currently under house confinement.\u201d</p><p>My skin started to get prickly, and suddenly, I didn\u2019t feel well. The thought of that bitch out of jail made me sick to my stomach. As I looked at Peyton, her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cHow the f**k did that bitch manage to get out of here?!\u201d Peyton snapped.</p><p>\u201cShe must have one hell of a lawyer, because according to my records, she was granted bail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said to the clerk as I grabbed Peyton\u2019s arms and hurried out of the building.</p><p>We walked back to the Range Rover, and all I thought about was if Connor knew this. But I knew there was no way he did because he would\u2019ve told me. My husband would\u2019ve told me something as crucial as that.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Connor knew about this?\u201d Peyton asked, as if she read my mind.</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s no way Connor knew.\u201d</p><p>We climbed into the vehicle, and I put my forehead on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cNow what, Elle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, we go to Ashlyn\u2019s apartment.\u201d</p><p>I heard Peyton gasp when I said that. I didn\u2019t care if it was wrong or not. I was going to see her one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cDo you even know where she lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. Remember, Connor was the one who bought her the damn apartment.\u201d</p><p>We drove an hour back to the city and headed straight to Ashlyn\u2019s apartment. I was furious that she was out on bail, and I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it.</p><p>\u201cFUCK!\u201d I screamed. \u201cHow the hell did she get out on bail? I yelled as we pulled into a parking space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>As Peyton and I took the elevator up to the floor that her apartment was on, my body was shaking with anger. The fact that she could burn down a building, admit it, then change her plea, and get out on bail was too much for me to handle. We stood in front of her door, and I gently knocked. A few seconds later, the door opened and Ashlyn stood there. Her eyes grew wide as she stared at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here!\u201d she exclaimed as she tried to shut the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d Peyton said as she threw her body against the door to stop it from shutting.</p><p>The two of them struggled while Ashlyn tried to shut the door and Peyton tried to keep it open.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ashlyn. I just want to talk to you,\u201d I pleaded.</p><p>Peyton managed to push the door all the way open and knock Ashlyn back a few steps. We walked inside and Peyton shut the door.</p><p>\u201cYou better make it quick or I\u2019m calling the police,\u201d she said.</p><p>My pulse was racing, and my skin was on fire as I stood in front of the woman who was ruining my family.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Ashlyn? Just tell me why you want to ruin my family.\u201d</p><p>As she looked at me, her eyes grew even darker. \u201cYou ruined my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I ruin your life?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou took the only person I ever loved away from me. You walked into his life, and he completely ignored me. He was the only person that ever paid attention to me.\u201d</p><p>Standing there, I could see how unstable this woman really was.</p><p>\u201cYou burned down Connor\u2019s building. You hired someone to destroy it. Now you have to suffer the consequences for your actions. Did you think you wouldn\u2019t get caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have gotten caught if that weasel wouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshlyn, do you have any regrets about what you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Connor hurt me deep down to the very core, just like he did my sister, and now I\u2019m going to make him pay for what he\u2019s done. I\u2019m going to make sure he never hurts me again, even if I have to destroy you and his precious little baby.\u201d</p><p>A fire burned through my body like never before and an anger I never knew I had emerged from deep within my soul. She threatened my daughter. To threaten me was one thing, but to threaten my child was another. She had just crossed a dangerous line. I felt like my body was out of control as I lunged at her and knocked her ass to the ground. I sat on top of her as I clutched her face with both my hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever threaten my daughter. Do you understand me, you psychotic bitch?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ashlyn struggled and managed to break from my grip as she pushed me off of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to f**king kill you, bitch! It\u2019s something I should have done instead of burning down that building!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>She came at me and grabbed my hair, knocking me down as I hit my forehead on the table. I heard Peyton scream as she tried to grab her. Suddenly, the door flew open and two men came running in. Connor grabbed me from behind and Denny grabbed Ashlyn and restrained her.</p><p>\u201cEllery, you\u2019re bleeding,\u201d Connor said as he wiped the blood from my head.</p> <p>\u201cShe threatened Julia,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Connor yelled as he looked at her.</p><p>Peyton went and got a cloth from the bathroom and handed it to Connor as he held it over my cut.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in big trouble,\u201d Connor said as he applied pressure to the wound.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, we\u2019re talking about it, Connor.\u201d</p><p>Two police officers walked into Ashlyn\u2019s apartment and took her from Denny.</p><p>One of the officers walked over and asked me what had happened.</p><p>\u201cShe just went crazy and came after me. She knocked me down, and I hit my head on the table,\u201d I said innocently.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to press charges for assault and battery, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be necessary,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>I glared at him in disbelief at what he just said. \u201cYes, I do want to press charges,\u201d I said.</p><p>Suddenly, Ashlyn yelled. \u201cShe came after me first. It was self-defense!\u201d</p><p>The officer looked at Peyton. \u201cWere you a witness, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was, and that woman made a clear threat to kill her and then she came at her and pushed her into that table. I was so scared, I couldn\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>As Ashlyn was screaming in her defense, the officer handcuffed her and escorted her out of the apartment. Denny looked at me and smiled as he walked over to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked as he took my hand.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>Connor removed the cloth from my wound, and it was still bleeding. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need stitches, Ellery,\u201d he said as he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m so angry with you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it, Connor. I\u2019m in no mood for a lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry\u2019s at the hospital. I just talked to him, and he\u2019s waiting for us. I\u2019ll drive the Range Rover and meet you there,\u201d Peyton said.</p><p>I looked at her and nodded my head as I asked, \u201cDid you get it all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure did.\u201d She smiled as she held up the little device she had in her hand.</p><p>As Peyton walked out of the apartment, Connor and Denny helped me up.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me I\u2019ve done this with you before.\u201d Denny smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Peyton get?\u201d Connor asked as we walked out of the apartment.</p><p>\u201cEvidence.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Connor helped me into the limo and then shut the door. He walked around and slid in next to me. The pain in my head was starting to get worse, and I didn\u2019t need him yelling at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you think you were doing?\u201d he asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cTrying to save our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you to stay away from her and you disobeyed me. You know how unstable she is. She could have killed you, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, please stop yelling. My head really hurts,\u201d I said as a tear sprang from my eye.</p><p>\u201cLay off, Connor. The two of you can talk about it later. The most important thing is that we get her head looked at,\u201d Denny said.</p><p>Connor turned away and looked out the window. I reached for his hand, but he pulled away. The last time he was this mad at me was back in Michigan when he found out about the cancer. Denny pulled up to the emergency entrance, and Peyton was waiting for me with a wheelchair. I opened the door myself and started to get out. Connor came around and grabbed my arm. I jerked away from him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I snapped as I sat down in the chair.</p><p>Peyton looked at him and then at me. She wheeled me to the registration desk and the nurse took me back into a room right away. She took the cloth from my head and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cDr. Henry can fix that up for you.\u201d She smiled as she patted my hand.</p><p>After she walked out of the room, Connor stood at the side of the table. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how he and Denny knew that I was at Ashlyn\u2019s apartment. It was bothering me on a whole new level. As I was about to ask the dreaded question that I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to know the answer to, Henry strolled into the room. He stood in the entrance with a smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cIs this d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSort of feels like it, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I replied.</p><p>While Henry stitched me up, he started to ask questions. \u201cSo, why were the two of you over at Ashlyn\u2019s place, but most importantly, what was she doing there? I thought she was in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, she posted bail and they let her out on house arrest,\u201d Peyton said.</p><p>He put the final stitch in and kissed me on the head. \u201cAll fixed up, again.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Connor didn\u2019t say a word. He just kept staring at me with a look of disappointment and anger. \u201cPeyton, I\u2019ll drive you home and Connor can take Ellery home in the Range Rover,\u201d Denny said.</p><p>Great, I thought to myself. I didn\u2019t want to be alone with him. I knew the biggest of arguments was coming, and I didn\u2019t feel good or strong enough to fight with him. He extended his hand to me and helped me off the table. I turned and looked at Peyton.</p><p>\u201cI want you and Henry to come over tonight for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO, Ellery. You need to rest,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. We have some things to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring dinner. So don\u2019t worry about anything,\u201d Peyton said as she walked over and hugged me.</p><p>Connor pulled the Range Rover up to the entrance and sat there. I thought he would\u2019ve gotten out and opened the door, but he didn\u2019t. He was being a complete a**hole, and I didn\u2019t appreciate it. My heart started beating faster when I climbed in and shut the door as he took off out of the hospital parking lot and drove us home.</p><p>The ride home was silent. He didn\u2019t say a word and neither did I. I walked up the stairs and into our bedroom. Mason had texted me earlier, saying that he was at the park with Julia and they\u2019d be back later. I sat on the edge of the bed and waited for Connor to come and start yelling at me. He walked into the room and handed me a white pill and a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cBefore I say a word, you are to answer two questions.\u201d</p><p>His angry eyes glared at me. \u201cYou are in no position to tell me what to do, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Ashlyn was out of jail?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Connor ran his hands through his hair and took in a sharp breath as he turned away and walked across the room. \u201cYes, I f**king knew!\u201d</p><p>As my body shook, I set the glass on the nightstand. \u201cYou knew and you didn\u2019t tell me? You lied to me, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you lied to me, Ellery!\u201d he said with a raised voice. \u201cI told you a hundred times that you were to stay away from her and you didn\u2019t listen. That\u2019s your problem: you never listen. You\u2019re always going off and doing whatever the f**k you want to without any consideration for me or my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to destroy you, destroy us, and our family. I couldn\u2019t sit back and let her do it.\u201d</p><p>Connor became enraged as he stepped closer to me and pointed his finger in my face. \u201cI told you that I wouldn\u2019t let her do that, yet you didn\u2019t believe me and had to take matters into your own hands. You could\u2019ve been killed. She\u2019s crazy like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was there?\u201d I asked as I got up from the bed.</p><p>Once again, he wouldn\u2019t look at me and he turned around. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you having me followed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Then suddenly, my mind kept going back to the times when he would randomly show up at the places where I was. I remembered when he showed up at FAO Schwarz and he knew exactly what floor I was on and what section Cassidy and I were in. I looked over at my phone, which was lying on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou motherfucker! You were keeping tabs on me through my phone?! You were tracking me?!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>The air was thick and he didn\u2019t need to say anything, because his silence said it all. I closed my eyes as I felt dizzy, and I needed to lay down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou had no right,\u201d I whispered as a tear streamed down my face.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me no choice, Ellery. I knew you would do something like this,\u201d he said calmly as he took a few steps closer to the bed.</p><p>\u201cI want you to get out of this bedroom and leave me alone. My head hurts and I need some space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we both need some space,\u201d he said as he walked out and shut the bedroom door.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Connor</p><p>After grabbing the bottle of Motrin from the bathroom cabinet, I walked into the living room and straight to the bar. Shaking two pills into my hand, I popped them in my mouth and chased them down with a glass of scotch.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little early to start drinking?\u201d Denny said as he walked in the room and sat down in the leather chair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too early to start drinking. Would you like one?\u201d I asked as I held up my glass.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he politely declined. \u201cDid you and Ellery have it out already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cI told you she was going to find out that you knew Ashlyn was out of jail. Did she find out how you\u2019ve been tracking her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said as I sat down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI warned you, Connor. I told you that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to keep secrets from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I had a choice. Look at what she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! She would\u2019ve done it anyway. So wouldn\u2019t it have been better to tell her from the start? Because if you ask me, the pain she\u2019s feeling now is far worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, what about me and how I\u2019m feeling, Denny? She lied to me. She lied about what she was doing and where she was going today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied, she lied. You two are perfect for each other. Listen, Connor, I know why you did what you did, and I know why Ellery did what she did. The truth of the matter is that at the end of the day, regardless of all the bullshit that went on earlier, you two love each other more than you did yesterday. I\u2019ll tell you something, though; you were one cold-hearted bastard to her in the limo and at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>I got up from the couch, walked over to the bar, and poured another scotch. \u201cDon\u2019t start with that, Denny.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cDamn right I\u2019ll start it. Your wife, the mother of your baby, is upstairs with stitches in her head because of that psycho girl you used to date, and instead of apologizing to her and comforting her, you\u2019re down here, throwing back scotch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd talking to you, may I add,\u201d I said with irritation. \u201cYou know Ellery, and you know how she can be. She\u2019s pissed off, and she told me to leave the bedroom because she needed space.\u201d</p><p>Denny got up from the chair and started walking towards the elevator. He stopped, turned around, and shot me a look. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel like an ass soon enough.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d I yelled as the elevator doors shut.</p><p>As I sighed and walked over to the bar to set down my glass, I heard the elevator door open. At first, I thought it was Denny, but I was pleasantly surprised when I looked over and saw Mason and Julia.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s my baby girl.\u201d I smiled when I took her from Mason\u2019s arms. \u201cDid you have fun at the park?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a fabulous time. She has made the most amazing friends and all the mannies love her.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Mason in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce a week, I meet the other mannies with their babies in the park. You wouldn\u2019t believe the stories they tell me about the families they work for, and I just sit there and brag about you and Ellery. Speaking of Diva Girl, where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a little accident earlier, and she\u2019s upstairs lying down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Mason exclaimed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fell and hit her head and needed a few stitches. She\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Mason put his hand over his mouth. \u201cDid she fall here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a long story. She\u2019ll tell you all about it tomorrow. She needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to take care of the princess for a while longer?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Consider yourself done for the day. Go home and relax.\u201d I smiled.</p> <p>\u201cIf you need me, just call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mason. I will,\u201d I said as the elevator door shut.</p><p>I looked at Julia and kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cI love you, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>I took Julia upstairs, changed her diaper, and then walked to my room. Ellery was still asleep across the bed. The bandage on her forehead started to bring back the memories of when I almost lost her. But it also reminded me of how close we became during that time. I smiled as I looked at her and then at Julia, who was also looking at her. My emotions were running deep from the events of the day. I was still so angry with her for lying to me and going to see Ashlyn. Julia started babbling, and Ellery opened her eyes. As she looked at Julia, she held out her hand. I walked over to the bed and sat down so Ellery could touch her.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby girl,\u201d she said as she took ahold of Julia\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d she said as she looked down. \u201cI\u2019m still really angry with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m still angry with you.\u201d</p> <p>Ellery sat up and held her arms out. I handed Julia over to her and she took her and hugged her tight. Then Ellery began to cry. It broke my heart to see her sitting there, holding Julia and crying.</p><p>\u201cBaby, don\u2019t,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t there. You didn\u2019t hear how that bitch threatened our daughter.\u201d</p><p>I sighed as my phone rang. I pulled it from my pocket and saw it was Lou calling.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lou,\u201d I answered as I got up from the bed. \u201cYeah, tonight will be fine; see you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Ellery asked.</p><p>\u201cLou\u2019s coming over tonight to discuss the events of today.\u201d</p><p>Ellery didn\u2019t say anything. She laid Julia on the bed and got up and walked to the bathroom. After a few moments, I went in to check on her. She was standing in front of the sink, looking at herself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI have no regrets for what I did today,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss it any more right now,\u201d I said as I stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I just wanted you to know that because, like you, I will not let anyone hurt or destroy my family,\u201d she said as she pushed me out of the way and walked out of the bathroom.</p><p>She picked up Julia from the bed and took her downstairs. As I stood there, contemplating what to do next, a text message came through from Cassidy.</p><p>\u201cEllery\u2019s studio is finished if you want to come take a look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cassidy, we\u2019ll be right down,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Ellery was in the kitchen, heating up a bottle for Julia when I walked down to let her know about her art studio.</p><p>\u201cCassidy just texted me that your art studio is ready. I told her that we\u2019d be right down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said as she held Julia and grabbed her bottle.</p><p>We stepped onto the elevator and rode it down to the tenth floor. As we stepped off, Cassidy was standing there with the door open. She took one look at Ellery\u2019s head and instantly became concerned.</p><p>\u201cEllery, what happened?\u201d she asked sympathetically as Ellery handed Julia to her.</p><p>\u201cI fell and hit my head. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>We walked inside the apartment, and it was finished to perfection. As Ellery smiled, I could tell she was pleased with the way it turned out.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Cassidy. I love it!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to start painting.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to Cassidy and gave her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cThank you, sis. It\u2019s beautiful. You\u2019ve really outdone yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now, I have to get going. Ben and I are taking Camden out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun.\u201d Ellery smiled as she gave her a hug.</p><p>I took Julia from her and continued to feed her as Cassidy left the apartment. Ellery stood in front of the easel that held a big blank canvas on it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start this painting tomorrow,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me with an angry look and left the apartment without saying a word. I looked down at Julia and sighed.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Ellery</p><p>I walked over to the bar and poured myself a shot of Jack. As I slammed it back, Connor stood there with Julia, staring at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to be drinking when you took a pain pill,\u201d he replied as he put Julia in her swing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Connor. One shot isn\u2019t going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Ashlyn could\u2019ve and you seem to think that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not listening to you anymore,\u201d I said as I tore up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou never do anyway!\u201d I heard him yell.</p><p>As I glanced at the time on my phone, I noticed that Peyton and Henry were going to be over soon. After I changed into more comfortable clothing, I went into the kitchen and took out a bottle of wine. I heard the elevator doors open and Connor greeting Peyton and Henry. When they walked into the kitchen, Henry walked over to me and gave me a light kiss.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sore, but I\u2019m okay.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I stood there thinking that at least someone cared. Peyton walked over to me and put her arm around me.</p><p>\u201cAre you and sexy man still fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. God, I\u2019m so mad at him for keeping that from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, but don\u2019t forget you kept something from him too.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and then flinched at the pain from the stitches. I reached up in the cabinet, grabbed four dinner plates, and then Peyton finished setting up the rest of the table. As the four of us sat down and ate our dinner, Peyton took out the recorder she had earlier. First, she looked at me and then over at Connor.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear this or not?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo, actually I don\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s on there. You shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Connor,\u201d I said as I got up and threw my plate in the sink and it broke.</p><p>\u201cWay to go, Elle!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>As I was on the verge of tears, the doorman rang and said that Lou was on his way up. I opened the door just as he stepped off the elevator in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lou,\u201d I said as he leaned over and kissed me on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>We gathered into the living room and Connor poured everyone their drinks. Lou looked at me as he asked, \u201cCan you tell me what happened today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what happened today,\u201d Peyton said as she pressed play on the recorder.</p><p>Connor handed Lou a drink and then sat down in the chair across from where I was sitting. He stared at me and he listened intently. He slowly closed his eyes when he heard Ashlyn say how she was going to destroy not only him, but me and Julia as well.</p><p>\u201cTalk about fatal attraction. Right, Lou?\u201d Peyton said.</p><p>When Lou finished listening to our horrific altercation, he looked at me and smiled. \u201cThat is one damn good confession and threat Ashlyn made. I\u2019m taking that to her lawyer and then submitting it as evidence. If she isn\u2019t advised to change her plea, then we\u2019ll continue to press the charges of assault and battery and she\u2019ll get added time for that. Ellery, I have a question for you and I need you to be completely honest with me. Did you physically attack her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, she did!\u201d Peyton spoke up. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen her. She knocked her ass to the ground and then grabbed a hold of her face and wouldn\u2019t let her go and told her she better never threaten her daughter again. Well, you heard it.\u201d</p><p>Connor looked at me with an expression of shock. \u201cOh, please. I already punched her out once; did you honestly think I wouldn\u2019t go after her when she threatened our daughter?\u201d I said to him.</p><p>Lou sat there, nodding his head. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep that information to ourselves. She doesn\u2019t have a mark on her and you have stitches. So, once the judge and jury hear what she had to say, they won\u2019t believe her anyway.\u201d</p><p>He got up from the chair, and we walked him to the door.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lou,\u201d Connor said as they shook hands.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He smiled. \u201cTake care of that head, Ellery. I\u2019m asking for a postponement and this could all be over within a week.\u201d</p><p>A feeling of relief flowed through me when I heard Lou say that. Peyton took Julia from her swing and walked over to me. \u201cIt\u2019s almost over, sweetie. Henry and I are going to leave. He has to be at the hospital in a few hours. Go take a pain pill, down a couple shots of that shit you like, and you\u2019ll sleep great.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her and took the baby as we said our goodbyes. Connor picked up the dirty glasses from the table and took them into the kitchen. He still didn\u2019t say anything to me, even after hearing what Ashlyn had said. Taking Julia upstairs to change her, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how hurt I was finding out that Connor knew Ashlyn was out of jail and how he was tracking my every move. A sick feeling emerged in my stomach as I laid Julia down in her crib. The only thing I wanted and needed was a hot bath.</p><p>As I started the bath, I poured a capful of bubbles under the stream of the hot water. Closing the bathroom door, I undressed, twisted up my hair, and lay back in the tub. If there was one person I needed the most right now, it was my mom. Tears started to fall down my face as the bullshit of the day settled inside me. I brought my knees up to my chest and wrapped my arms around my legs as I sobbed into them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEllery,\u201d I heard Connor whisper as he opened the door and walked in.</p><p>He climbed into the bathtub, behind me, fully dressed, and wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby,\u201d he began to cry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything you\u2019ve been through today. I just wanted to shield you from the scariness of the world. I wanted to protect you, Ellery. I need you to try and understand why I did what I did and why I behaved the way that I did. I love you so damn much.\u201d</p><p>Bringing my arms to his, he loosened his grip around me and I turned around to face him. He tilted his head as he stared at me and tried to wipe away the mascara stains from under my eyes. Bringing my hand up to his face, I gently wiped away each tear that fell from his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cLook at you; your clothes are soaking wet.\u201d I smiled softly.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter as long as I\u2019m holding you.\u201d He smiled as his hand softly swept across my cheek.</p><p>\u201cDo you forgive me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I forgive you. Do you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I love you way too much not to.\u201d</p> <p>I sat down at my easel to start my third painting. A peaceful feeling was restored throughout my body now that Ashlyn had been found guilty and sentenced to twenty-five years in prison with no possibility of parole. Connor was more relaxed, and so was I without the trial hanging over our heads. Julia was growing so fast, we could barely keep up with her. As the sunlight beamed through the windows, I decided to take advantage of the beautiful day and take Julia to Central Park. I grabbed my sketchpad and headed up to the penthouse. As I stepped off the elevator, I saw Mason and Julia in the living room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you the afternoon off because I\u2019m taking Julia to Central Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh goody, can I come?\u201d Mason asked as he handed me the baby.</p><p>I felt bad telling him no, but I wanted to spend some time alone with my daughter.</p><p>\u201cAw, Mason. I\u2019m sorry, but I really just want to spend some time alone with Julia. Considering all the shit that went on, I feel like a horrible mom that I haven\u2019t spent as much time with her as I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Mama.\u201d He smiled as he kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>\u201cI do need you to do me a favor, though. I need you to go to the spa for me,\u201d I said as I grabbed my purse and pulled out my wallet.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need from the spa?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI need you to get the works done: massage, manicure, and facial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said as I handed him some money. \u201cConsider this a perk because you have done so much for Connor and me, and we appreciate it. I know it isn\u2019t much, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019s awesome. Thank you, doll face!\u201d he said excitedly as he kissed me and headed towards the elevator.</p><p>As I smiled and kissed Julia on the nose, I desperately wished that Connor could join us in the park, but he had back-to-back meetings all day, plus a conference call. I put Julia in her stroller, packed her diaper bag, grabbed a blanket, my drawing pad, pencils, and bottled water. After I made sure I had everything I needed, I pushed the stroller onto the elevator and walked to Central Park.</p><p>The flowers in the Conservatory Garden were as beautiful as always. As I was pushing Julia, I looked ahead and noticed there was no one in my favorite spot. When I reached it, I spread out the blanket on the grass, kicked off my shoes, and took Julia from her stroller.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my favorite place, Julia. I hope that it\u2019ll be yours too someday.\u201d</p><p>I laid her down on the blanket and took off her socks. She started kicking and moving her arms around while making the cutest cooing sounds. I opened up my drawing pad and began drawing the picture I had envisioned for my painting. Looking over at Julia, I started to sketch a field of flowers. A few moments later, I heard my phone ring. As I pulled it from my bag, I smiled when I saw it was Connor calling.</p><p>\u201cLook; it\u2019s your daddy,\u201d I said as I showed Julia the phone. \u201cHello,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby, I was thinking we could have lunch together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds nice. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about now? Turn around,\u201d he said.</p><p>I turned around and watched as Connor walked towards me with a bag in his hand. Grinning from ear to ear, I hung up and set my phone down.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>Before sitting down on the blanket, he kicked off his shoes and took off his socks. \u201cI talked to Mason. I tried to call you earlier and it went straight to voicemail, so I called him and asked him to put you on the phone, and he told that me you and Julia were here,\u201d he said as he sat down and kissed me.</p><p>\u201cI thought you had back-to-back meetings and a conference call today?\u201d</p><p>Connor picked up Julia and started playing with her. \u201cI did. I had a couple of meetings already, but when I found out that my wife and daughter were in Central Park, I wanted to spend the day with them, so I cancelled the rest of my meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here with us.\u201d I smiled as I stroked his cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen it and find out.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the bag and looked inside. \u201cAw, you brought us hot dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how much you love them here.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>As I took the hot dogs from the bag, Connor put Julia in her stroller.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to discuss with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be mad that I didn\u2019t discuss this with you first because it just sort of happened suddenly.\u201d</p><p>As I gave him a worried look, he smiled and cupped my chin in his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing bad.\u201d</p><p>I let out a sigh of relief as he began to tell me what he did. \u201cI\u2019ve invested in Vinnie\u2019s art gallery in Chicago. I\u2019m now his partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cHis partner pulled out at the last minute and left him with a half-finished gallery and not enough funds to complete it and get it ready for the opening. He called me and asked if I would be interested in investing in the gallery and being his partner. I had my business attorney draw up the legal papers and he\u2019s coming to the office tomorrow to sign them.\u201d</p><p>As I sat there and stared at him, I needed to tell him something that I\u2019d been thinking about for a while.</p><p>\u201cCan I be totally honest with you about something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, baby. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you already owned the art gallery and that you didn\u2019t want to tell me.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face was dumbfounded. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just a feeling I had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were wrong. I had nothing to do with that gallery until this morning. I can\u2019t believe you would think that I wouldn\u2019t tell you something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said as I cocked my head and pursed my lips.</p><p>\u201cRight. Point taken,\u201d he said while nodding his head.</p><p>After we ate our hot dogs and Julia had fallen asleep, Connor and I lay down on the blanket. I snuggled up against him as he put his arm around me, and we looked up at the sky.</p><p>\u201cThis is a perfect day,\u201d he said as he kissed my head.</p><p>\u201cEvery day is perfect when we\u2019re together.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day I found you lying here, in the rain. You were so sick, and I was so scared. You broke my heart that day, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cBy telling me you were lying here so that no one would know you were crying. You have no idea how that killed me inside to hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>I lifted up my head and looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. My life was so different then. You saved me from myself.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me and his lips brushed against mine. \u201cWe saved each other.\u201d</p><p>Even though I wanted to stay in this spot forever, our heartfelt moment was soon interrupted by Julia\u2019s cry. We both smiled as we got up and Connor took her from the stroller.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time we head home,\u201d I said as I started packing up.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>After kissing Julia on both cheeks, Connor put her in the stroller and pulled out his phone.</p><p>\u201cWho are you calling?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDenny. I\u2019m telling him to come pick us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Denny I said hi!\u201d I smiled as I took the stroller and started walking.</p><p>\u201cEllery Rose Black! Come back here with that baby!\u201d he said rather loudly.</p><p>I turned my head and looked at him with a big smile on my face. \u201cHave fun in the limo by yourself, Mr. Black! My baby and I are walking home.\u201d</p><p>Before long, Connor was right behind me. \u201cYou are so stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one of a million, baby. Just one of a million,\u201d he said as he put his arm around me.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Connor</p><p>Ellery had been working hard on her paintings. The opening was next month and she still had two more pictures to paint. Mason had gone to California for a week with Landon, so I helped out as much as I could with Julia so Ellery wouldn\u2019t worry about taking care of her. I had given Claire the day off to take her husband to the doctor, and Peyton was out of town with Henry. I had planned to stay home and work, but my attention was needed at the office. I tried to call my family for help, forgetting they were all out of town as well. Ellery had just left for the studio and Phil called, stating that I needed to be at the office for a meeting regarding the new Chicago building, and today was the only day it could be done. I looked at Julia as she sat in her bouncy seat.</p><p>\u201cListen, Julia. Daddy is going to take you to the office and I need you to be extra good. Okay?\u201d</p><p>As she smiled at me, she screeched. She thought it was funny that I asked her to be extra good. I put her in her car seat, grabbed the diaper bag, and stepped into the elevator. Today was Denny\u2019s day off, so I would have to drive the Range Rover to work. I stopped by Ellery\u2019s studio to let her know that I was taking Julia with me. As I walked through the door, she turned around and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey, what\u2019s up?\u201d she asked as she walked over and kissed me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking Julia to the office. I have a few things that I need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, by myself. Do you think I\u2019m not capable of spending the day with my daughter alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think you\u2019re capable. Good luck, sweetie.\u201d She smiled as she bent down and kissed Julia\u2019s head.</p><p>I put my hand on the knob, turned it, and opened the door. Turning around and looking at her, I said, \u201cWas that good luck for me or for Julia?\u201d I asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cIt was for both of you.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>As I put Julia in the back and buckled the car seat, she started to cry. Shit, I thought to myself, and I was already running late for the meeting. She had just eaten so I knew she wasn\u2019t hungry, and I had just changed her diaper before we left. I reached in the diaper bag and pulled out her pacifier. Ellery wasn\u2019t too keen on her having it, but this was an emergency. When I put it in her mouth, she stopped crying. I let out a sigh of relief as I climbed in the driver\u2019s side and headed to the office. Traffic was horrible, and Julia started crying again. I looked in the rearview mirror and her pacifier had fallen out of her mouth. Her screams grew louder as I tried to reach back and grab it. After I finally found it, I put it back in her mouth, but she didn\u2019t want it. She spit it out and started screaming. I didn\u2019t want to call Ellery because I didn\u2019t want her to worry, so I dialed the next best person: Mason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHel\u2014Connor, why is the princess crying like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason, I need your help. I\u2019m taking Julia to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m stuck in traffic, and she won\u2019t stop screaming. She won\u2019t take the pacifier either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou gave her the pacifier? Does Ellery know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and you\u2019re not going to tell her either. Help me; I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any classical music with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook in the diaper bag. There may be a CD in there.\u201d</p> <p>Reaching in the back, I grabbed a hold of the diaper bag and, as I was bringing it up to the front, items started falling out onto the floor. Julia was still screaming, and I was about to have a nervous breakdown.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no f**king CD in here!\u201d I screamed into the phone.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s nothing you can do until you get to the office.\u201d</p><p>After hanging up, I looked at my phone and had an idea. Still stuck in traffic, I downloaded some classical music onto my phone. Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy\u201d was the first song on the list. I hit play and turned the volume up as loud as it would go. I held the phone towards the back and closer to Julia. She didn\u2019t stop crying right away, but the noise was becoming softer. As traffic started moving, Julia fell asleep, and I felt like I could breathe again. Finally, we arrived at Black Enterprises. I pulled into the parking garage and parked in my spot. As I looked behind me, I saw that Julia was still asleep, and I needed her to stay that way. I carefully opened the door and started picking up all the things from the diaper bag that fell on the floor. As I gently unbuckled the car seat, Julia\u2019s eyes opened, and I froze. Grabbing the pacifier that was sitting next to her, I put in her mouth and her eyes slowly closed. I started to sweat at the thought of her screaming bloody murder again.</p><p>Stepping off the back elevator that led to my office, I was instantly surrounded by a flock of women who wanted to see Julia. When I walked down the hallway to my office, I realized that Valerie wasn\u2019t sitting at her desk. Shit, her vacation started today, I remembered as I was counting on her to keep an eye on Julia. Opening the door to my office, I set the car seat on my desk, while I gathered some files for the meeting.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Connor! Why is Julia here?\u201d Phil asked in shock.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t have anyone to watch her, Phil,\u201d I replied with irritation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a manny or nanny or whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on vacation, and Ellery is working on her paintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bring a baby to a meeting,\u201d he said.</p><p>Glaring at his stupidity, I calmly said, \u201cHave you forgotten that Black Enterprises is my company and I can do whatever the hell I want? If I want to bring my daughter to the meeting, then I\u2019ll damn well do it!\u201d</p><p>Phil sighed and walked out of the office. \u201cThe meeting starts in five minutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Julia opened her eyes. I grabbed my files and the car seat and headed to the boardroom.</p><p>Upon entering the room with fifteen men and women, all eyes glared at me when I walked in. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late, but as you can see, I have my daughter with me today and if any one of you has a problem with it, the door is right over there. Are we clear?\u201d</p> <p>While I stood and looked at the people in the room, there was silence. \u201cVery good. Now let\u2019s proceed.\u201d</p><p>As I changed Julia\u2019s diaper, I looked up and saw Ellery standing in the doorway of the nursery with a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby, how long have you been standing there?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cLong enough to hear that little conversation the two of you were having.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a private conversation between me and my daughter.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She walked into the nursery, gave me a kiss, and picked up Julia from the changing table.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go today with your daddy?\u201d Ellery asked her as she held her in the air.</p><p>\u201cThings went fine. I don\u2019t know why you have a hard time believing that I can\u2019t handle my daughter by myself,\u201d I said as I threw the diaper away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Julia? You screamed all the way to the office, and daddy was having a meltdown?\u201d</p><p>Damn it. She must have talked to Mason. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it went down, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard, Connor.\u201d She grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Mason tell you that I called him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Julia? Daddy gave you the pacifier?\u201d She glared at me.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I do anything without someone telling you everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason didn\u2019t tell me, well, not technically. I was on the phone with him when you called, and I made him put it on three-way so I could listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllery Rose! That\u2019s an invasion of privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. I found it amusing and as much as I wanted to come rescue you, I knew you\u2019d figure out what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the confidence,\u201d I said as I put my hands on her h*ps and softly kissed her on the lips.</p><p>\u201cAfter all, you are the CEO of a billion-dollar company. You\u2019ve dealt with worse. I wasn\u2019t worried that one little baby would be the thing to break you. I\u2019ll admit that I was a little worried about something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you worried about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing sexier than a man with a baby, and I could see those vultures at your office taking advantage of that.\u201d</p><p>Smiling at her, I took Julia from her arms and laid her down in her crib.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ellery laughed as I picked her up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one vulture I want taking advantage of me, and I want it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, what about Julia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. She\u2019s safe in her crib, and if she starts to cry, then we\u2019ll stop. But, I want to make love to you now. I don\u2019t want to wait another second.\u201d</p><p>Before laying her down on the bed, my fingers tugged at the bottom of her shirt, lifting it over her head. As my mouth smashed into hers, she reached her arms back and unhooked her bra, letting it fall to the floor. After my hand cupped her breast and tugged at the hardness of her nipple, I picked her up and she wrapped her legs around me as I laid her gently on the bed. I wanted to devour her as I took her breast in my mouth. Her fingers were quickly unbuttoning my pants as I was unbuttoning hers. I stood up and took them down as fast as I could. I ripped my shirt from me and threw it on the floor as she sat up and took her pants off, throwing them across the room. She looked at me with a seductive smile and laid down on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Ellery, you have me so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen put that erection to good use, Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>A growl came from the back of my throat, and I swore I almost came right then and there when she said that. I dipped my finger inside her to make sure she was ready for me, and sure enough, she was more than ready. Hovering over her, I slowly pushed myself inside and began thrusting in and out of her when, suddenly, Julia began to cry.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare stop, Connor!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no \u2018buts\u2019! You cannot and will not stop! I\u2019m so close. Oh God. Oh God!\u201d Ellery screamed as her body tightened and released itself, causing me to explode inside her.</p><p>We lay there as our hearts raced and we tried to catch our breath. All of a sudden, it was quiet. Ellery turned her head and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cOf course she stops crying now.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>That\u2019s my daughter. My love, my life, and my little angel.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Ellery</p><p>As I stood in front of my easel, putting the final touches on my fourth painting, I looked out the large window that overlooked the city. So many thoughts ran through my head about the showing at the gallery, Connor\u2019s new Chicago building, and Peyton\u2019s bachelorette party, which was starting tomorrow at ten a.m. Connor and I had a slight argument about it because he wanted Denny to drive us around the city all day and night. I told him no, and he wasn\u2019t happy. Needless to say, I won. I didn\u2019t understand what he was so worried about, because he was having Henry\u2019s bachelor party tomorrow night as well. I heard the door open and, as I turned around, Connor walked in, set his briefcase on the chair, and then wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cHi, good looking.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt feels so good to hold you. I missed you, baby,\u201d he said as he buried his face into my neck.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those days where if everything could go wrong, it did. Where\u2019s Julia?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at home with Mason.\u201d</p><p>He broke our embrace and looked at me. \u201cNow tell me exactly what you\u2019re doing tomorrow for Peyton\u2019s bachelorette party.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him with knitted eyebrows. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your husband, and I should know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>I was hoping to get away without having to go over the party detail by detail because he wasn\u2019t going to be happy when he heard what I had planned. This could be the start of a huge fight.</p><p>\u201cPlease have a seat, Mr. Black, while I explain to you the details of Peyton\u2019s bachelorette party. You will in no way say a word or comment on the upcoming events. There will be no arguments, no harsh words, and I forbid you to become jealous. If you decide you want to start an argument, then you\u2019ll be cut off from sex for a very long time. This is my best friend\u2019s party and I\u2019m putting everything sexy into it before she gets married. It\u2019s what we women do, and if you can\u2019t trust me, your wife, who loves you more than life, then you need to go and see your therapist.\u201d</p><p>He sat there, with his legs crossed and his hands folded in his lap, and stared at me as I finished my last sentence. \u201cOkay, and the same goes for you.\u201d</p><p>After he said that, I started to get a little worried and a sick feeling crept inside my stomach. But I wasn\u2019t going to let him know that. He didn\u2019t know what I had planned, and I didn\u2019t know what he had planned. We were both going to do our own thing and trust each other. I knew how much he loved me and he knew how much I loved him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d I said as I faked a smile.</p><p>He got up from the couch, kissed me, and said he had some plans to confirm. I knew he did it on purpose because it was killing him that he didn\u2019t know what I had planned, so he was trying to get back at me. I told him that I\u2019d be upstairs in a bit after I finished my painting. Connor\u2019s mom and dad were taking care of Julia for the weekend because Mason and Landon were joining the bachelorette party.</p><p>The next morning, I awoke before Connor. We had dropped off Julia at his parents\u2019 house last night and then we had sex all over the penthouse, taking advantage of the fact that Julia wasn\u2019t here to interrupt us. While I stood in front of the mirror, I put my blonde hair up in a high ponytail. As I brushed my teeth, Connor stood in the doorway of the bathroom in nothing but his pajama bottoms, with his muscular arms against the doorframe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m just admiring your beauty before we part ways in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>I spit in the sink and rinsed my mouth before walking over to him and placing my hands on his bare and sculpted chest.</p><p>\u201cI hate the fact that we aren\u2019t going to see each other until tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. Me too,\u201d he said as he held my face and kissed my lips.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are your plans?\u201d I asked casually.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you a thing. You\u2019re so secretive about your party, so I\u2019m being secretive too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize you sound like a baby, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but only your baby,\u201d he whispered as he licked behind my ear and then slapped me on the ass.</p> <p>I giggled as I packed the last of the things I needed for the party. When Connor was done showering and getting dressed, he grabbed my bag and we took the elevator down to the parking garage, where two limos were waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cYour limo, my love,\u201d Connor said as he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you, darling.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me and pulled me into him. \u201cBe careful, behave, and be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Connor, I\u2019ll be fine. You do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ellery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Connor,\u201d I said as I got in the limo and we pulled away.</p><p>We picked up Mason and Landon, since they lived around the corner, and then we picked up Peyton and the other girls in the wedding party. Peyton was wound up and ready to get the party started. She didn\u2019t have any idea of what I had planned. In fact, nobody did, not even Mason.</p><p>\u201cOkay, bestie, tell me what\u2019s on the agenda for today and tonight and why we had to pack an overnight bag!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see when we get there.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>The limo pulled up to the curb of the Waldorf Hotel and all eyes grew wide.</p><p>\u201cElle, what did you do?\u201d Mason asked.</p><p>I smiled as the driver opened the door and we all stepped out of the limo. \u201cOur day starts here,\u201d I said.</p><p>As we walked through the doors of the hotel, we were instantly greeted by the concierge. \u201cMrs. Black, welcome to the Waldorf.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said as the bellhop took our bags and led us to the elevator. When we reached the Presidential Suite, I put the card key in the slot and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cLook at this f**king place!\u201d Peyton squealed.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve died and gone to Heaven,\u201d Mason said as he looked around the suite.</p><p>\u201cI have hairstylists and makeup artists for each of us coming in to do our hair and make up for tonight.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up!\u201d Peyton screamed as she threw her arms around me.</p><p>I grabbed my phone from my purse and looked at the time. \u201cOkay, everyone, we have spa appointments in five minutes. We\u2019re all getting the works. Massage, facial, manicures, and pedicures.\u201d</p><p>As we walked out of the suite, Mason looped his arm around me. \u201cYou sure know how to do it up, girl!\u201d He smiled.</p><p>We all changed into our luxurious robes and slippers from the spa. I realized that I had left my phone in the suite, and I needed to keep it on me in case there was an emergency with Julia.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I left my phone in the room,\u201d I said as I got up and walked out of the spa.</p><p>While I stood and waited for the elevator, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Connor and how I already was starting to miss him. I was beginning to regret not telling him my plans, but I knew he wouldn\u2019t approve of the nightlife with his safety issues and all. When the elevator doors opened, I gasped and I stood there, unable to move. The man inside of the elevator looked at me. I looked at him. As I swallowed hard, my heart began beating rapidly from the way he was staring at me. His mysterious eyes studied me as they looked me up and down.</p><p>\u201cWhich floor, miss?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThirty-fifth, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpa?\u201d he asked as he stared at the robe I was wearing.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m throwing a bachelorette party for my best friend,\u201d I answered as I bit down on my bottom lip.</p><p>The elevator stopped at the thirty-fifth floor and we both stepped out. \u201cHave a good time at the bachelorette party. Hopefully, I\u2019ll run into you again.\u201d He smiled as I turned right and he turned left. I smiled and nodded my head as I thanked him and walked to my room. I took the key from the pocket of my robe and, as I slid it in, I turned my head and looked in the direction he went, only to find him six rooms down, staring at me. As I opened the door, I quickly stepped inside the room and shut it. Backing up against the door, I let out deep breaths as my heart pounded rapidly in my chest. What the hell is wrong with me? I walked over to where my phone sat on the table and checked it. There weren\u2019t any messages from my in-laws or Connor.</p><p>As I lay on the massage table, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the elevator, the man in it, and the way he looked at me. My heart began to rapidly pick up pace just from the thought. My mind needed to snap back into reality if I was going to pull this party off. After all of us were finished with our spa appointments, we went back to the room and Peyton screamed when she walked in and saw two hot, buff men wearing nothing but little aprons, cuffs and bow ties.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Ellery! I f**king love you!\u201d</p><p>As I laughed at her reaction, Landon walked over to me. \u201cNice touch, Ellery.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>The buff butlers opened a bottle of champagne and handed each of us a glass. It wasn\u2019t too long after that the stylists arrived. I pulled out a rhinestone studded, silver tiara that said \u201cBride to be\u201d and handed it to Peyton\u2019s hairstylist. While we were getting ready for our big night out, room service was delivered. The butler answered the door as the trays of sushi, and cheese, and crackers were delivered to the room. Taking the card from the tray, the buff butler handed it to me. It read:</p><p>\u201cA little gift for you and your girls.</p><p>I hope you enjoy it.</p><p>Regards, the man from the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d Peyton asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just from the hotel staff,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cButlers in the buff, bring those trays over here!\u201d she said.</p><p>I smiled as I read the note and, once again, my heart started racing at the thought of him. The mystery of him got under my skin. I couldn\u2019t believe he sent the trays and that he was thinking about me.</p><p>\u201cHello, Elle! What world are you lost in?\u201d Peyton said as she snapped her fingers.</p><p>I looked at her in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked like you were stuck in space or something. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I was just thinking about Julia,\u201d I replied as I sipped my champagne.</p><p>Once my hair and makeup were done, I stepped into my bedroom and took out the dress I had bought. As I slipped it on, I looked in the mirror. The low cut, short silvery beaded dress was perfect for tonight.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, hot and sexy mama!\u201d Mason said as he walked into the room. \u201cThat dress is hot and your up-do hairstyle really complements it. I don\u2019t think Connor would approve of you looking like that without him by your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor\u2019s not here, is he?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not, but you better be careful because you\u2019re going to have all the guys drooling on the floor.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I put on my silver, high-heeled, Jimmy Choos. Everyone looked amazing. Before leaving the suite, I took out the white sash that was embellished with the words \u201cBride to be\u201d on it and put it on Peyton.</p><p>\u201cThere! Now your outfit\u2019s complete.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Peyton hugged me and there was a knock at the door. As I opened it, the bellhop handed me a piece of white paper. I opened it and it read:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sitting at the bar in the hotel.</p><p>If you can join me, even for a few minutes,</p><p>I\u2019d appreciate it.</p><p>Regards, the man from the elevator.\u201d</p><p>My rapidly beating pulse was about to give away my nervousness as I turned to the group and told them I\u2019d be right back, that the concierge needed to see me downstairs. As I grabbed my small clutch, I told them I\u2019d meet them in the limo in about twenty minutes. I took the elevator down to the lobby and walked to the bar. As I saw him sitting on the bar stool, the nervous butterflies in my stomach were fluttering their wings like crazy. Why was I doing this? How could I do this? He turned his head and his eyes burned through me. I nervously walked over and sat down on the stool next to him.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d show,\u201d he said as he picked up his glass.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you for the sushi and cheese trays you sent to my room. That was very nice of you, but you didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I didn\u2019t, but I thought you and your female companions would enjoy it. Did you enjoy it?\u201d he asked as he stared into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, very much. Thank you,\u201d I replied as my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I have to meet my friends in the limo in about ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you object if I told you how stunning you look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said as I looked down.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re married,\u201d he said as he looked at my ring.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am, and I have a baby at home.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at his hand to see if he was wearing a ring and he was. \u201cI see you\u2019re married as well.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me as the corners of his mouth curved slightly upwards. \u201cYes, I am. But that doesn\u2019t stop me from looking at beautiful women. Apparently, it doesn\u2019t stop you either because you\u2019re sitting here with me.\u201d</p><p>I gulped as I got up from the stool. He reached over and placed his hand on mine as an electrical shock shot through my body. \u201cThank you for coming down and meeting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go. Thank you again for the trays,\u201d I said as I walked out of there as fast as I could.</p><p>Everyone was waiting for me in the limo. As the driver opened the door for me, I slid in next to Mason.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right? You look flushed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Now let\u2019s go and have a good time.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>We arrived at the first club and had dinner up on the rooftop. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the man from the elevator and how it had felt when he touched me. Needing to see if I had any missed calls or text messages, I pulled my phone from my clutch and saw nothing. I wondered what Connor was doing and I felt like I needed to text him.</p><p>\u201cHi, babe. I just want to make sure you\u2019re having a good time.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, a reply from him came through.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. We\u2019re having a great time. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am. I just wanted to tell you that I love you,\u201d I typed with guilt.</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Remember to stay safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>As I put my phone back in my clutch, I grabbed my glass of wine and drank it as fast as I could. I put all thoughts of the man from the elevator out of my mind so I could enjoy the evening that I had spent months planning. We ate, drank, and had a good time. But the fun didn\u2019t really start until we walked into the club called X. It was a high-class strip club that was divided in half. One side of the club was male strippers and the other half was female strippers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We sat at the table, waiting for the show to start. Peyton was already drunk and so were a few of the girls. I needed a drink and didn\u2019t want to wait for the waitress, so I excused myself and walked up to the large bar that was shared by both sides of the club. As the bartender approached me, I ordered a shot of Jack. He put the shot glass down in front of me and I threw it back, allowing the burning sensation to coat my throat. Suddenly, I was startled by a voice in my ear.</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t this a coincidence seeing you here. It must be fate,\u201d the deep voice whispered as his scent captured me and his hot breath warmed my neck.</p><p>Once again, my heart started beating rapidly as the lower half of me started to ache. \u201cAre you following me?\u201d I asked without turning around.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to ask you the same question. Do you always come to strip clubs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I told you before that it\u2019s my best friend\u2019s bachelorette party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s right,\u201d he said as he traced little circles on my shoulder with his finger.</p><p>My skin started to heat up at his touch. There wasn\u2019t anywhere I could go. He had me trapped between the bar and the stool. \u201cAm I making you uncomfortable?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a bit,\u201d I answered nervously.</p><p>\u201cI apologize. You better get back to your friends,\u201d he whispered as he leaned in closer to me and I felt his lips slightly touch my neck.</p> <p>I flinched and he moved his arm so I could get by. As I walked away, I turned around, even though every part of me said not to. But I did, because I could feel his burning eyes all over me. I sat back at the table just in time for the show to start.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Landon asked. \u201cWe were going to start a search party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bar was packed. It took forever to get the bartender\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><p>The show started and one male stripper walked onto the stage. Peyton started going crazy and yelling. I looked over at her and laughed because she was standing on the chair. I needed to use the bathroom, so I got up from my seat and told the group that I\u2019d be right back. I was feeling a little tipsy from the Jack and coke I was drinking and then the champagne I had earlier. I couldn\u2019t find the bathrooms, so I had to ask one of the waitresses. She pointed down the long hallway and said they were on the left. After peeing, what seemed like forever, I washed my hands and, when I opened the door, I was startled to see the line of people down the narrow hallway. When I stepped out of the bathroom and tried to make my way through the crowd of people, I felt two hands grab my waist. I turned around and it was him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay; let me guide you out of here,\u201d he said.</p><p>As we were reaching the end of the hallway, two drunken girls stumbled and pushed us up against the wall.</p> <p>\u201cHold on. Let them pass,\u201d he whispered in my ear.</p><p>I gulped as the ache down below came back and my senses were heightened by his tantalizing scent; an unfamiliar scent to me. Once the girls passed by, he grabbed my waist and led me out of the hallway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn around, but hold out your hand,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>I did what he asked and I held my hand out in front of me. He put a piece of white paper in it and then he closed my hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let anybody see that. It\u2019s only for you,\u201d he whispered and then walked away in the opposite direction.</p><p>I opened my hand and unfolded the piece of paper. It read:</p><p>My room, tonight, after your party.</p><p>Room 4709</p> <p>I\u2019ll be there, waiting for you.</p><p>As I stood there staring at the note, I heard someone call my name. I looked up and closed my hand tightly as Mason walked towards me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s taking you so long?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLook at the line,\u201d I said as I took his hand and we walked back to our table.</p><p>Our time at the strip club was finished and we needed to move on to the last club. As I helped Peyton into the limo, she wouldn\u2019t stop talking about the lap dance she received from the stripper. Everyone was cracking jokes and having a good time. I was starting to get a bit worried that Peyton was too drunk to go to the next club, but she insisted she was fine. When I opened my clutch to pull out my phone, the white piece of paper fell onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cOops, you dropped something,\u201d Landon said as he reached down and picked it up.</p><p>\u201cNo! I can get it,\u201d I said in a sharp tone.</p><p>Mason picked up the paper and handed it to me. \u201cWow, calm down, Elle, it\u2019s only a piece of paper. \u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>The club was packed. The music was blaring, and the floor was thumping. I tried to get my mind off of him, but I couldn\u2019t. His tall stature and assurance were startling, but in a way that was to be desired. To distract myself from the thoughts of him that seemed to consume me, I lost myself in the music, dancing, drinking, and having a good time. When it was time to leave, Landon had to carry Peyton to the limo as the girls and I stumbled behind, laughing and practically falling on our asses. I pulled my phone from my clutch and there were no messages or missed calls from anyone. Not too long after we left the club, we were back at the Waldorf. Landon carried Peyton to the room and collapsed on the couch. I pulled the white piece of paper from my clutch and stared at the room number. It wasn\u2019t the same room he had gone into earlier in the day. This room was on the top floor of the hotel.</p><p>I took in a deep breath and stepped off the elevator. I knocked quietly on the door of Room 4709. Immediately, the door opened, and he stood there with a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cPlease come in,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I would either,\u201d I said as I stepped inside his room.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019ve had way too much already.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his mouth curved up when I said that. \u201cIs that so?\u201d he said as he walked closer to me, took my clutch from my hands, and threw it on the chair. He stood in front of me, and as I looked down, he cupped my chin in his hand and lifted it up until I was forced to look at him.</p><p>\u201cSomeone as beautiful as you should never be looking down.\u201d</p><p>As I took in a sharp breath, he took his finger and ran it across my jaw line. \u201cYou\u2019re so stunning. From the moment I laid eyes on you, I wanted you. I know you felt it too. I could tell by the look in your beautiful blue eyes. Did you feel something?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head lightly as his gaze held mine.</p><p>\u201cSay it. I want to hear you say that you felt something when you saw me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt something,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He leaned closer to me, gently nipped my bottom lip, and then looked at me. \u201cDo you want me to f**k you? Because I\u2019ve wanted to since the moment I saw you,\u201d he said as he traced my lips with his finger.</p><p>The words wouldn\u2019t escape my lips, so I nodded my head.</p><p>His mouth crashed into mine as my lips parted slightly, allowing his tongue to explore my mouth. Once he had me against the wall, he cupped me below, feeling my soaked panties as his fingers pushed them to the side and he inserted his finger inside me.</p><p>\u201cI knew I turned you on,\u201d he said as his lips pursued my neck.</p><p>While I ran my fingers through his hair, he took down both straps of my dress and let it fall to the floor. \u201cI want you to leave your shoes on,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>His right hand kneaded my breast as his left ripped the panties right from me. I gasped as he dipped two fingers inside. He moved them in and out of me while he unbuttoned his pants with his other hand and took them down. My breathing was rapid and my moans became louder as he inserted himself into me. He was rock hard and so strong that each time he pushed deeper into me, he sent my body into convulsions. I wrapped my legs tightly around him as he held me up against the wall and continued to thrust in and out of me.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, oh my God,\u201d I yelled as my body shook and he brought me to an amazing orgasm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I want to feel your pleasure all over me,\u201d he said as he forcefully pushed himself into me one last time and I felt him explode inside of me.</p><p>With my legs still wrapped around him, he looked at me and kissed my lips. \u201cWell played, Mrs. Black.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9, Mr. Black.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>I unwrapped my legs and he gently put me down. \u201cPlease say you\u2019ll stay with me tonight instead of going back to your room. I don\u2019t want to sleep alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll stay here. I love you so much, Connor,\u201d I said as I wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>We climbed into the luxury bed and Connor wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cDid you know I was here? I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I had no idea you\u2019d be here. I had a Vegas room set up in the suite for Henry\u2019s party and one of the other guys arranged the strip club. When the elevator doors opened and I saw you standing there, you took my breath away, and I felt like it was my first time ever seeing you. That\u2019s why I wanted to pretend that I didn\u2019t know you, and when you played along, that\u2019s when I decided to play it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should do this more often.\u201d I smiled as I rolled over and his arms tightened around me.</p><p>As he softly kissed my back, he whispered, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a little talk in the morning about that dress you were wearing.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I closed my eyes and fell fast asleep.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>Connor</p><p>One month later...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit if his wife left him. You tell him that the Chicago building better be ready next month for the inspection. I\u2019ve paid him good money to see that it gets done, and it better be ready! Because if it\u2019s not, you tell that son-of-a-bitch that I\u2019ll see him in court,\u201d I yelled as I threw my phone across the desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ellery said as she walked into my home office, carrying Julia.</p><p>\u201cJust people not doing what they\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d I sighed as I got up from my desk and walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cIs it the Chicago building again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, it is, but I don\u2019t want you worrying about it,\u201d I said as I kissed her head and took Julia from her. \u201cHave you finished the last painting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have. I just finished it a few minutes ago.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll have them wrapped and shipped to the gallery. They\u2019ll be there just in time for the opening next week.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Julia and she stared at me with her big blue eyes as I talked to Ellery. She was growing so fast. Ellery had started her on baby food and she\u2019d learned to sit up by herself.</p><p>\u201cPeyton and Henry come home today from their month-long honeymoon,\u201d Ellery said.</p><p>\u201cThey had a great wedding. I can\u2019t believe how fast it came and went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Time is going by so fast. Look at how big Julia is getting already,\u201d she said.</p><p>We heard the elevator doors open and Mason announcing that he had arrived.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to hit the gym?\u201d I asked Ellery.</p><p>\u201cYou bet I am. Let me go and grab my bag.\u201d</p><p>We walked out of the office and I handed Julia over to Mason. \u201cThere\u2019s the little princess.\u201d He smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While Ellery grabbed her bag, I took mine from the hall closet and grabbed my keys. \u201cI forgot to tell you that I\u2019m driving us today. Denny called me this morning, and he\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d</p><p>Ellery turned and looked at me. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d she asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. He just said he wasn\u2019t feeling well and that he\u2019s sorry, but he couldn\u2019t work today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenny is never sick,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m a little worried about him, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just picked up a bug. People at the office are sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he feels better soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, baby,\u201d I said as I put my arm around her and we headed to the gym.</p><p>After our workout, Ellery dropped me off at the office and took the Range Rover with her. I told her that I\u2019d catch a cab home this evening. Valerie followed me into my office, rattling off all the meetings that were scheduled for today. As I sighed, I set my briefcase down on my desk and looked out the large window that overlooked the city. My mind wouldn\u2019t stop thinking about Denny. In all the years I\u2019d known him, he had never once been sick, and I was concerned.</p><p>\u201cMr. Black, are you all right?\u201d Valerie asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Valerie. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a couple of things to do before my first meeting.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head and walked out of the office, closing the door behind her. As I turned my computer on, the screen displayed a picture of Ellery and Julia. After a few minutes had passed, Phil and Paul walked into the office, summoning me to the meeting. I left my phone on my desk and grabbed my files.</p><p>While I sat in the board room on a conference call with Sakura Nakamora, CEO of Takashi Enterprises, a Japanese company we were trying to negotiate a contract with, Ellery came through the door. As I saw her, I jumped out of my seat.</p><p>\u201cEllery, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, as I could tell she looked panicked.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s Denny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish this meeting without me,\u201d I said as I looked at Paul and Phil.</p> <p>I placed my hand on the small of her back and led her out to the hallway. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked as we walked to my office.</p><p>\u201cDana called me and said that Denny had a seizure, so she called an ambulance and they immediately rushed him to the emergency room. We both tried calling you, but you weren\u2019t answering your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I left it on my desk while I was in my meeting. I\u2019m sorry, baby,\u201d I said as we walked into my office, and I grabbed my phone.</p><p>\u201cI tried to call Valerie, but she wasn\u2019t at her desk. I knew you had a meeting, so when you weren\u2019t in your office, I figured you were in the board room.\u201d</p><p>We raced down to where Ellery had parked the Range Rover. We got in and I drove as quickly as I could to the ER. Once we arrived, the nurse took us back to where Denny was. When we walked into the room, Dana got up from her seat and I gave her a hug.</p><p>\u201cConnor, Ellery, thank you for coming,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Dana?\u201d I asked her as I looked over at Denny. He was sleeping.</p><p>\u201cHe woke up this morning, said he wasn\u2019t feeling well, but he couldn\u2019t describe what was wrong. He said he felt dizzy. So I made him lie down for a while and when he went to get out of bed, he fell to the floor and started seizing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure it was a seizure?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, my sister used to have them all the time,\u201d she said as she cried.</p><p>As I held her tightly and told her that he was going to be okay, Denny opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell are you hugging my wife,\u201d he said with a slight grin.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell are you lying in that bed in the emergency room? You were supposed to work today.\u201d I smiled as I put my hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d survive without me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure of that,\u201d I said with a serious tone.</p><p>He looked at Dana and held out his hand to her. She took it as more tears started to fall. Ellery walked over to her and clasped her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDana, stop the tears,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>The doctor walked in with the nurse and told Denny that they were going to run a CT scan to see what was going on. As they took him out of the room, I took Ellery\u2019s hand and we waited in the waiting room of the ER.</p><p>\u201cI could use a glass of scotch right now,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow about some coffee instead?\u201d Ellery asked as she smiled at me.</p><p>I put my arm around her and we headed to the Starbucks that was inside the hospital. Ellery handed me my coffee and, on our way back to the waiting room, we ran into Dr. Taub.</p><p>\u201cEllery, Connor; it\u2019s nice to see you. Ellery, are you here for your annual blood work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dr. Taub. A friend of ours was brought into the ER and we\u2019re here visiting,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I hope your friend is okay. Don\u2019t forget about that blood work. You know how important that is,\u201d he said as he walked away.</p><p>We waited an hour before Denny was brought back to his room. As we were sitting there with him, the doctor walked in and asked to speak with Denny and Dana alone.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you have to say, you can say it in front of them; they\u2019re my family,\u201d Denny said.</p><p>The doctor cleared his throat before he began to speak. \u201cThe CT scan showed a tumor in the brain.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Dana broke down and started crying. As I grabbed her, to keep her from falling, Ellery took a hold of Denny\u2019s other hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a specialist, but I\u2019ve called one in to come see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name and how good is he?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best neurosurgeons we have on staff. He\u2019s very reputable. His name is Dr. William Armstrong and he\u2019ll be in tonight to see you. Until then, we\u2019re going to keep you here overnight, and after Dr. Armstrong consults with you, then we\u2019ll have a better understanding on how to proceed.\u201d</p><p>Denny\u2019s expression never changed as he listened intently to every word the doctor spoke to him.</p><p>\u201cIs the food here any good?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ellery laughed as she squeezed his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay then, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>The doctor smiled as he walked out of the room. Denny looked over at Dana and squeezed her hand. \u201cStop crying, woman. Everything\u2019s going to be fine. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you will be.\u201d Ellery smiled at him.</p><p>Hearing the news that Denny had a brain tumor sickened my stomach. I didn\u2019t know much about them, but what I did know was that they weren\u2019t good. As I stepped out of the room to make a phone call, Ellery followed me. I took my phone out of my pocket and dialed Bernie.</p><p>\u201cBernie, it\u2019s Connor. I need you to dig up everything you can on a Dr. William Armstrong. He\u2019s a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital here in the city. I want everything; do you understand me? This is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Black, I\u2019ll get on it right away and get back with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said as I ended the call.</p><p>Ellery grabbed my hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to make sure he\u2019s the best, because if he isn\u2019t, then I\u2019m flying in the best.\u201d</p><p>Ellery and I left the hospital to go home and be with Julia for a while, before coming back later when Dr. Armstrong was going to be there. As I set Julia in her highchair to eat and, while Ellery was getting her food ready, my phone rang. It was Bernie.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d I said as I answered.</p><p>\u201cDr. Armstrong is rated one of the best in his field. His credentials are excellent, Connor. I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Bernie. I appreciate it,\u201d I said as I ended the call.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Ellery asked as she set the jars of baby food on the table.</p><p>\u201cHe said that he\u2019s one of the best. So, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>As I took the baby spoon and dipped it into the jar, Julia started to squeal. I smiled as I brought the spoon to her mouth and she gracefully took it.</p><p>\u201cMason said that he would watch Julia for us tonight while we\u2019re at the hospital. Have you called your mom and dad yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I still have to do that. I will as soon as I\u2019m done feeding Julia.\u201d</p><p>Ellery walked over to me and put her arms around my neck. \u201cI can feed her, babe,\u201d she said as she kissed my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI want to finish feeding her. I\u2019ll call them after.\u201d</p><p>When Julia was finished eating, Ellery cleaned her up and took her out of her highchair while I went and called my mom and dad. They were upset when I told them the news and said to let them know what was going on and when they could visit. About an hour later, Mason stepped off the elevator with Landon.</p><p>\u201cHey, you two,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, we\u2019re going to take Julia with us furniture shopping,\u201d Mason said.</p><p>\u201cOh, that sounds like fun!\u201d Ellery exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I said as I walked upstairs.</p><p>I went into the bathroom and splashed some water on my face. Things weren\u2019t sitting right with me, and I had a bad feeling. I stood with my hands on the counter when Ellery walked in and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cConnor, are you okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elle. To be honest, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d</p><p>She walked over to me and wrapped her arms tightly around my waist. I needed her now more than ever before. I closed my eyes as she rested her head on my back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try to think positive about this, Connor. I know it\u2019s hard, believe me, but positivity is the key to staying strong, and we need to be strong for him and Dana. Your strength is what pulled me through my illness, even when we thought there was no hope.\u201d</p><p>I turned around and held her face in my hands. \u201cI never gave up hope. Hope was all I had. I wouldn\u2019t have made it through without it. The thought of losing you to that illness flooded my mind every day, but I never once gave up hope, and I never once gave up on you.\u201d</p><p>Tears formed in her eyes and her bottom lip started to quiver. \u201cI had given up. I lost all hope for me. Then I met you. You made me fall in love with you, and you showed me there was a reason to fight. You had enough hope for both of us and, if it wasn\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d</p><p>A single tear fell from my eye as I listened to her words. I pulled her into me and held her as tightly as I could. She was my safety, my saint, and my savior, and I thanked God every day for not taking her away from me. She jumped up and wrapped her legs around me and I carried her to our bed. I gently laid her down and stared into her eyes as I softly kissed her lips. Believe it or not, that was all I wanted. I just wanted to kiss her and nothing else.</p><p>When Ellery and I went up to Denny\u2019s room, Dr. Armstrong had just left and Dana was crying. Ellery walked over to Dana to comfort her, and Denny gave me a sullen look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What did Dr. Armstrong say?\u201d I asked as I went and stood at his bedside.</p><p>\u201cI have a Grade III brain tumor and it\u2019s aggressive. Which means it\u2019s growing rapidly.\u201d</p><p>When I heard Denny speak those words, my stomach twisted itself in knots. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I have brain cancer and there\u2019s a possibility it spread somewhere else. But he won\u2019t know that until they do an MRI.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen are you having that done?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the morning,\u201d he said as he looked away from me.</p><p>I had no words at that moment. I didn\u2019t know what to say. The worry that I once thought was gone from my life had returned, just with someone else that I loved, and was very important to me. Ellery looked at me with tears in her eyes as she tried to comfort Dana.</p><p>\u201cWhat about surgery?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe said it\u2019s operable and that he\u2019ll discuss that with me after the results of the MRI come back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Denny,\u201d I said as I looked down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, Connor. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Ellery sat on the edge of the bed and placed her hand on Denny\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m always here if you need me. If you want to cry, talk, laugh, or even scream, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>If anyone knew how Denny felt, it was Ellery. She had endured, battled, and fought her cancer, not only once, but twice. As Denny started to grow tired, we decided it was best to leave. Dana walked us out of room as we said goodbye.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine, Dana. I\u2019m not going to stand here and tell you not to worry because I know you can\u2019t help it. Go home and get some rest. You\u2019ll be no good to him if you\u2019re tired,\u201d I said as I kissed her head.</p><p>She smiled and nodded her head as she turned and walked back into Denny\u2019s room. I sighed and looked at Ellery as she looked like she was lost in a thought.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that pretty little head of yours?\u201d I asked as I pushed her hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cI know what he\u2019s going through, and I know what he\u2019s feeling. It breaks my heart that he has to go through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, it\u2019s a damn good thing he has you to talk to,\u201d I said as I pulled her into me and hugged her tightly.</p><p>I could tell she was as scared as I was. She had too much on her plate already with the gallery showing and with Julia. She had just moved on and put to rest the trial and the incident with Ashlyn. As I glanced over at her while we were driving home, that look of pain and sadness was spread across her face. I grabbed her hand and brought it up to my lips.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re feeling, Elle.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and then took in a sharp breath. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going through this all over again. Even though it isn\u2019t me, it\u2019s someone that I love and is like a father to me. FUCK,\u201d she screamed.</p><p>I pulled over to the side of the road, threw the Range Rover in park and got out. I walked around to the passenger\u2019s side and opened the door. I grabbed Ellery from her seat and held her as tight as I could.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, let it out,\u201d I said as tears swelled in my eyes.</p> <p>Ellery sobbed into my chest and we both slowly fell to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why the f**k did this have to happen to him? It\u2019s not fair, Connor. He has brain cancer, and I\u2019m so scared he\u2019s going to die. He\u2019s the father I never had. He\u2019s always there for me. He can\u2019t die. He can\u2019t die, Connor,\u201d she screamed.</p><p>She was shaking uncontrollably. I\u2019d never seen her this way before, and it was killing me. The only thing I could do was hold her and try to give her some comfort. The tears pooled from my eyes as I buried my face into her neck. We needed to be strong, but we also needed to let our feelings out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to beat this, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say another word. She just cried in my arms until there were no more tears. I told her we needed to get home to Julia, and she nodded her head as I helped her back into the truck. I helped her with her seatbelt, then kissed her on the head before shutting the door.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Ellery</p><p>A few days had passed and Denny\u2019s MRI showed that the cancer hadn\u2019t spread to any other organs in his body. Connor and I were relieved with the news. Dr. Armstrong had scheduled the surgery for Friday, which was the day of the gallery\u2019s opening and my showing. Connor had all my paintings flown to Chicago already, so I had nothing to worry about. I just needed to show up. At this point, I no longer wanted to go. Denny was more important and so was being there for him, Dana, and Connor. I just wasn\u2019t sure how Connor was going to take the news.</p><p>I gave Mason the day off, and Julia and I drove over to Denny\u2019s house for a visit. He seemed to be in high spirits. As he sat in the chair across from me, I reached forward and grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re scared, but Dr. Armstrong is one of the best in the country. You know that Connor had him checked out thoroughly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know he did, and I don\u2019t doubt that he\u2019s the best, but the thought of my brain being cut into isn\u2019t very pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not, but it has to be done. After, you\u2019ll start chemo for a while, and then you\u2019ll be cancer free and you can put all of this behind you.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done, Elle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I\u2019ve put it all behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think of the \u2018what if\u2019s\u2019?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I do, especially when I\u2019m with Connor. If I can\u2019t sleep at night, I\u2019ll roll over, wrap my arms around him, and start to think about what if the treatments didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s who we are as human beings, Denny. Those thoughts will always creep up in your mind, and you\u2019re the only one who can put them to rest.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as I got up from the chair and took Julia from Dana. As I walked over to Denny, I handed Julia to him.</p><p>\u201cGive Uncle Denny a kiss goodbye,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She made her cute noises and proceeded to hit him in the face. \u201cYour daddy taught you that, didn\u2019t he?\u201d He laughed.</p><p>Denny gave her a kiss on the cheek and a hug. I leaned over, kissed him goodbye, and Julia and I headed home.</p><p>The penthouse was quiet. No one was home but me and Julia. I set her down on her blanket in the living room and surrounded her with toys. As fall was settling in, and it was getting chilly, I walked over to the fireplace and turned it on. I sat down on the blanket across from her and began playing with her and her toys. I gave some more thought about my showing on Friday and decided that I could fly to Chicago right before the opening and fly back the same night. After an hour had passed, Connor came home. He kicked off his shoes, set his briefcase down on the chair, and joined us on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHow are my two special girls?\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good, sweetheart,\u201d I said as I kissed him.</p><p>Julia started yelling when Connor sat down. She was becoming very vocal lately. Her high-pitched voice was hard on the ears. Connor leaned towards her, held her arms, and stood her up. Her little legs wobbled as she smiled and shrieked.</p><p>\u201cWow, she\u2019s really happy today!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been very good all day. We went and saw Denny earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is he? I stopped by this morning before going to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay. I can tell he\u2019s scared about the surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s natural. I would be too,\u201d Connor said as he carefully lowered Julia down.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about Friday,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it? That\u2019s the day of Denny\u2019s surgery.\u201d</p><p>That was all he said. He didn\u2019t mention anything about the opening or my showing. It must\u2019ve slipped his mind with everything going on. I wasn\u2019t going to discuss it further. I was going to get in and get out of that gallery as fast as I could. I\u2019d be home before Connor even noticed I was missing.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to tell you that Mason is keeping Julia all day and all night at his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he said as he leaned over and kissed me, forcing me on my back as he wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Our make-out session was interrupted by Julia\u2019s screeches. Connor broke our kiss and we looked at her. She was on her knees, rocking back and forth.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Connor, she\u2019s going to crawl!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>Instantly, he sat up and held his arms out to her. \u201cCome to Daddy, Julia,\u201d he said.</p><p>She stayed in that position and smiled. When she wouldn\u2019t move, I took all her toys and moved them away from her and set one block in front of her, but far enough away so that she would have to crawl to reach it. She started to get frustrated as she kept falling over. Soon, she\u2019d had enough and let out a full-blown cry. Connor picked her up and held her. I would never get tired of seeing him with her. Then I started to think about what Denny said and the what if\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get her a bottle. She\u2019s probably hungry,\u201d I said as I got up.</p><p>As I walked to the kitchen, I remembered that I had to call Vinnie and tell him not to mention the opening to Connor. That was the last thing I wanted him to worry about. I got Julia\u2019s bottle ready and walked back to the living room, where I found Connor asleep in the oversized leather recliner and Julia curled up on his chest. Smiling, I snapped a picture with my phone and sent it to Peyton.</p><p>Since Denny\u2019s surgery was scheduled for six o\u2019clock in the morning, Mason had come and picked up Julia the night before. When the alarm went off, Connor rolled over and put his arm around me as I reached over and turned it off. I snuggled closer to him for a few minutes before we had to get up and get ready to go to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cMe and you need to have a talk,\u201d he said in a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cThe art gallery and showing tonight.\u201d</p><p>Shit, I thought to myself. I should have never underestimated him and thought that he\u2019d forget something.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little pissed off that you failed to mention it to me and the fact that you\u2019re going without me.\u201d</p><p>I rolled over and looked at him. \u201cHow did you remember with everything going on, and how did you know I was going without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pilot called me last night to confirm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn him. Why didn\u2019t you say anything last night?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause Mason had just picked up Julia and I wanted to devour your body. I figured if I mentioned it, we\u2019d fight and then no body devouring for me.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head in disbelief that he had just said what he did. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am, and I wasn\u2019t giving that up. It\u2019s not that often that Julia isn\u2019t here to interrupt us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about this now. We need to get ready and go to the hospital,\u201d I said as I got out of bed.</p><p>Connor climbed out of bed and followed me into the bathroom. \u201cSee, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, Ellery. We are going to discuss it now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Who the hell did he think he was, starting an argument with me before I even had my first cup of coffee? I slipped on my silk robe and headed towards the kitchen and Connor followed behind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you; end of discussion. See, now that wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to me, picked me up, and set me on the counter. \u201cListen to me. You\u2019re my wife and this is something that\u2019s very important to you, and it\u2019s important to me too. \u201c</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut me off and brought his finger to my lips. \u201cNo buts. I love Denny and we\u2019ll be here for his surgery. But I\u2019m getting on that plane with you and we\u2019re going to that art gallery together. I would never miss your first showing, or any showing, and to think that you were going to go by yourself really hurt me, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>As I stared into his eyes, I could see the hurt in them. What the hell did I do? My eyes started to swell with tears as I wrapped my arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I just feel so guilty having to go to this showing while someone that I love very much will be having brain surgery. I feel so selfish, Connor, and I didn\u2019t want you to have to make a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was never a decision to be made, honey. I was going with you all along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I began to cry.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs and finish getting dressed so we can get to the hospital,\u201d he said as he kissed me on my head and picked me up off the counter.</p><p>Thanks to the morning New York City traffic, we arrived at the hospital just as the nurse was getting ready to wheel Denny out of the room and into the operating room.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see you two before I went under the big knife and got my brain cut open,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDamn traffic,\u201d Connor said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here waiting for you when you get out, so make it quick.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll try.\u201d Denny smiled back.</p> <p>After I gave him a kiss on the cheek, I whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re strong and you can do this. Remember, I\u2019m out here waiting for you, so you better come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said as they wheeled him down the hallway.</p><p>Connor put his arm around Dana and led her to the waiting room. Dana\u2019s family arrived and tried to keep her as occupied as possible. Connor and I left the waiting room and went up to the cafeteria to grab some lunch.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous about tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. You\u2019re a very talented artist, and everyone is going to love your paintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that because you\u2019re my husband.\u201d I smiled and stuck out my tongue at him.</p><p>Connor laughed and threw a straw wrapper at me and then he glanced at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s been six hours already since Denny went into surgery. We should get back to the waiting room.\u201d</p> <p>He grabbed our trays and then my hand as we walked back to the waiting room. We weren\u2019t back very long when the doctor came to speak to us.</p><p>\u201cWe were able to remove the tumor, but it did cause some cerebral hemorrhaging and there was significant swelling in the brain. During the surgery, he slipped into a coma.\u201d</p><p>Connor grabbed Dana as she almost fell to the ground. Instantly, a sick feeling washed over me, and I needed to sit down. This can\u2019t be happening. Doctor Armstrong continued as Connor kept a tight grip on Dana.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t uncommon, and we\u2019re keeping an eye on him very carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will he be in a coma?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>Dr. Armstrong sighed as he looked at us. \u201cThere\u2019s no telling. It could be up to twelve hours or twelve days. I wish I had an exact answer for you, but I don\u2019t. The good news is that the tumor is gone, and the cancer didn\u2019t spread to any other organs. So now, we just have to wait. He\u2019s back in his room and you may go see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Armstrong,\u201d Connor said as he walked away.</p><p>He looked over at me and shook his head as Dana sobbed in his arms. \u201cCome on, Dana, let\u2019s go see him,\u201d he said, leading her to Denny\u2019s room.</p><p>I got up from my chair and followed behind. When we reached the room and I saw Denny lying there, tears started to fill my eyes. The soft beeps of the machines to which he was hooked up, and the white bandage that was wrapped around his head were horrifying. Dana almost collapsed before Connor sat her down in the chair. He looked over at me as the tears streamed down my face. As Dana reached over and ran her hand across Denny\u2019s cheek, Connor came over and pulled me into him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d he said as he kissed my head.</p><p>I needed to be strong, and I couldn\u2019t let Dana see me fall apart. I pulled back from Connor, kissed him, and told him I\u2019d be right back. When I found the nearest bathroom, I stood and stared at my tear-soaked eyes. The thought of going to Chicago terrified me. I found myself no longer wanting to go for the fear that something bad would happen to Denny while we were gone. But, Denny had made me promise him that I would go; not just for myself, but for him. When I walked back to the room, Connor walked over to me.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s settled down now. It\u2019s time for us to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you wanted to stay with her,\u201d I spoke softly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already settled this, and I\u2019m going with you. Now I don\u2019t want to hear another word about it. Do you understand me?\u201d he said in a commanding tone.</p><p>I nodded my head and we said goodbye to Dana and her family. Connor told her to keep us posted and that we\u2019d be back tomorrow. As we walked out of the hospital, hand in hand, I could tell Connor wasn\u2019t doing well, but he refused to show it. I was worried that if he didn\u2019t let his feelings out, he was going to have a break down.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Connor</p><p>Ellery\u2019s paintings looked stunning up on the brand new walls of the art gallery. Vinnie did a fine job displaying each piece of artwork. Ellery had never looked more beautiful than she did in her short, lace, cream-colored dress. I felt it was too short and too low cut. We had a slight discussion about it when she put it on, but like always, she shut me down and told me to deal with it. She was breathtaking, and I didn\u2019t want other men looking at her. But, that\u2019s the price you pay when you\u2019re married to the most beautiful and sexy woman on Earth. As I carefully watched her mix and mingle with the other artists and guests, Vinnie walked up to me and handed me a glass of champagne.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Vinnie. You did a fine job with this opening. The gallery looks fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Connor, but none of this would have been possible without your help.\u201d He smiled. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Ellery\u2019s artwork look fabulous up on the wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. Look at all the people over there, admiring them,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I see my brother,\u201d Vinnie said as he walked away.</p><p>The art gallery was filled with influential people. The Governor of Chicago and some outstanding photographers were only a few. As I walked around, admiring some of the other artwork, I came across a display of paintings of beautiful nak*d women. Ellery walked over to me as I was staring at them.</p><p>\u201cI see you found something to admire,\u201d she said as she looked at the paintings.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful and so exquisite, aren\u2019t they?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Ellery looked at me and then looked back at the portraits. \u201cIf you\u2019re in love with them so much, the model is right over there. Maybe you could ask her if she would like you to f**k her!\u201d she snapped as she walked away.</p><p>What the hell just happened? I couldn\u2019t believe Ellery had just said that. I turned around to look for her, but she was gone. I tried to search the gallery for her, but I kept getting stopped by people. When I finally was able to break free, I found her over by her paintings, talking to a group of people.</p><p>\u201cGood evening. Please excuse us; I need to talk to my wife for a moment.\u201d I smiled as I lightly touched Ellery\u2019s arm and let her to a quiet corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cMe? What the f**k was all that about back there?\u201d I snapped back.</p><p>\u201cPeople are staring, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest you put on a fake smile, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>She did just that and she proceeded to yell at me. \u201cYou were gushing all over those nak*d paintings. I simply pointed out that the model is here if you wanted to f**k her, since she was so beautiful and exquisite, and you couldn\u2019t stop staring at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? Are you f**king serious right now? I can\u2019t believe you would be jealous over something like that. My God, Ellery, I was staring at it and saying those things about the artist\u2019s skill, not the actual model. I was picturing you in that painting because I want one of you, nak*d.\u201d</p><p>She looked away from me as she bit down on her bottom lip. I had to do everything in my power to keep from putting my hands all over her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I gave you the wrong impression. You know I would never want anyone else. I love you, Ellery. I don\u2019t know how to make that any clearer to you than I already have since we\u2019ve been together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, and I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just my nerves with this opening, missing Julia, and the fact that Denny is lying in a hospital bed in a coma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby,\u201d I said as I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her tight. \u201cIt\u2019s almost over and then we\u2019ll be on our way home.\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden, we heard a voice behind us. \u201cReally? You can\u2019t wait until after the showing?\u201d Peyton said.</p><p>Ellery\u2019s eyes lit up when she saw Peyton and Henry standing there and a huge smile graced her face as looked across the gallery and saw my family smiling at her. I hadn\u2019t told her they were coming; I wanted it be a surprise. She took them over to her section and Henry stayed back with me.</p><p>\u201cI heard about Denny. I\u2019m sorry, man,\u201d he said as he patted me on the back.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Henry, but I don\u2019t really want to talk about it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. If you need anything let me know.\u201d</p><p>Peyton stood in front of the portraits of the nak*d woman that Ellery and I had just fought about. Henry and I walked over and stood next to her. Not too long after, Ellery joined us.</p><p>\u201cWill you paint me nak*d, Elle?\u201d Peyton asked.</p><p>I looked over at Henry, and he smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ellery answered.</p><p>\u201cCan I watch?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>The night went smoothly and Ellery sold all five of her paintings. She was very happy, but she just wanted to get back home. We both did. We missed our baby girl, and we wanted to get back to Denny.</p><p>It had been a long and exhausting day. Ellery and I were lying on the couch together on the plane. As I held her in my arms, she tilted her head back and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI gave some thought about what you said earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what, baby?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout you wanting a nude portrait of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And what did you decide?\u201d I smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI decided that when we get back to New York, I\u2019m going to call that artist and ask him to do it. After all, I know you wouldn\u2019t have a problem with a strange man staring at me for six or seven hours a day while I\u2019m fully nak*d in front of him, posing.\u201d</p><p>I took in a sharp breath. \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s just forget about that painting. I have the real thing right here and that\u2019s all I need.\u201d I smiled as I leaned down and kissed her lips. There was no way I was going to let that happen.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>Ellery</p> <p>I paced back and forth, trying to comfort Julia as she screamed her head off at three o\u2019clock in the morning. I bounced her, walked her around the penthouse, sat down, rocked her in the rocking chair, and nothing soothed her. I even gave her gas drops, thinking she was gassy, but that didn\u2019t help either. Connor came up behind me in the living room and took her from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Julia? Daddy\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes because sometimes he thought he was the cure-all where she was concerned. When she didn\u2019t stop screaming, he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a book or something you can refer to?\u201d he asked as he bounced her up and down and she continued to scream even louder.</p><p>I ran upstairs to our bedroom and grabbed the baby book from the bookshelf. As I ran down the stairs, I turned to the section that was outlined for her age group.</p> <p>\u201cIt says she may be teething. Run your finger along her gums and see if you feel anything,\u201d I said.</p><p>He took his finger and put it in Julia\u2019s mouth. \u201cYep, I feel a lump right here,\u201d he said.</p><p>When I walked over to him, he took my finger and placed it on Julia\u2019s gums. \u201cAw, my poor baby,\u201d I pouted as I kissed her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and get the baby Tylenol. That should help her feel better.\u201d</p><p>Connor followed me into the kitchen, and I took the Tylenol from the cupboard. I gave Julia her dosage and we sat with her on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI can take her, sweetheart. You have to get up for work in a couple of hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We can do this together.\u201d He smiled as he leaned over and kissed me.</p><p>The Tylenol took effect and Julia finally fell asleep. Connor slowly got up from the couch, took her upstairs, and laid her down in her crib. I climbed under my warm sheets and closed my eyes. As I began to drift asleep, I felt little kisses all over my back. I opened my eyes and rolled over.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Connor climbed on top of me and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going to make love to you and then you can go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? What if I don\u2019t want you to make love to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllery Rose Black! I better never hear those words come from your mouth.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when he said that. I held his face in my hands as he hovered over me. \u201cMake love to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind,\u201d he said as he got off of me and rolled over.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d I exclaimed as I took my pillow and hit him with it.</p><p>\u201cSo, you want a pillow fight, do you?\u201d He retaliated by taking his pillow and hitting me back.</p><p>I stood up on the bed with my pillow in hand and hit him with it again. He jumped out of bed and swung his pillow at me, but missed when I jumped to the other side. As I jumped off the bed, we stood and stared at each other from opposite sides, waiting for the other to make a move.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t getting off that easy, baby,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cBring it on, Black.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>He stood there and shook his head. \u201cYou wait until I get a hold of you.\u201d</p><p>It was now four o\u2019clock in the morning, and I couldn\u2019t believe we were having a pillow fight. Connor finally made his move and ran to the other side of the bed where I stood. I laughed as I tried to dash across the bed to the other side, but he grabbed my leg and I screamed. As I fell onto the bed, he positioned himself on top of me and covered my mouth with his hand.</p><p>\u201cShh...you\u2019re going to wake the baby, and we can\u2019t have her waking up quite yet.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Lying there, I stared into his eyes as he stared into mine and, with his hand still covering my mouth, he asked, \u201cDo you want me to make love to you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head, and he smiled as he took his other hand and placed it between my legs.</p><p>When the alarm went off, I heard Julia whining. We\u2019d only slept about two hours. He turned and looked at me as I rolled over, and he kissed me on the head.</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep, sweetheart. I\u2019ll take care of Julia before I head to the office. You need your rest after your workout last night.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>I sighed, rolled over, and went back to sleep. I wasn\u2019t going to argue with him because I was dead tired.</p><p>A couple of hours later, I woke up and headed to the kitchen for some coffee. Mason was already over and feeding Julia in her highchair.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Elle. Oh my, look at those bags under your eyes. Did Connor keep you up all night?\u201d</p><p>I poured some coffee in my cup, kissed Julia on the head, and sat down across from Mason. \u201cHe did for about an hour, but it was Julia who was up all night screaming. She\u2019s teething.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I hope you used the teething gel in the diaper bag,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was teething gel in the diaper bag! Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot, sorry. I figured you go in the diaper bag every day, so you would\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>Just as I was about to answer him, a text message came through on my phone from a restricted number.</p><p>\u201cYou are one of the most beautiful women I\u2019ve ever seen and I can\u2019t stop thinking about you. You haunt my dreams.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I showed the message to Mason. \u201cI have the most romantic husband in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird; why would he send it from a restricted number?\u201d Mason asked.</p><p>\u201cHe likes to play games.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>A shower was required before I headed over to the hospital to see Denny. I got up from the table and went upstairs. After I got dressed, I kissed Julia goodbye and took a cab to the hospital. Dana was the only one in the room and she smiled when she saw me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d I asked as I walked over to the bed and touched his hand.</p><p>\u201cStill the same, but Dr. Armstrong said that the swelling in his brain went down and that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>No matter how many times I visited him, it didn\u2019t get any easier. Dana said she was going to take a little break and meet her sister in the cafeteria for coffee. When she left the room, I sat in the chair, took a hold of his hand, and squeezed it tight.</p><p>\u201cDenny, it\u2019s me, Ellery. We all miss you so much and we need you to wake up. It\u2019s so hard seeing you like this. I know you\u2019re strong and you\u2019re going to pull through this.\u201d</p><p>Just as I was talking to him, my phone beeped with a text message. It was from the restricted number again.</p><p>\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t find my last text out of line. I just needed you to know that I find you exquisite and I couldn\u2019t let another day go by without telling you.\u201d</p><p>When I tried to send a reply, the message wouldn\u2019t go through. I thought it was strange, but it was Connor, so I would play his game with him until tonight when he got home from work. After leaving the hospital, I had a few errands to run and then I met Peyton for lunch at our favorite restaurant. I walked over to the booth where she was sitting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJust by five minutes and you\u2019re always late. You were late for your own wedding.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI know. Don\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me all about the fabulous honeymoon,\u201d I said as I took a sip of water.</p><p>\u201cIt was amazing! I didn\u2019t want to come home.\u201d She pouted.</p><p>I reached in my purse for my phone when I heard it beeping. As I pulled it out, there was another text message from that same restricted number. Connor must be bored today or something, I thought.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re enjoying my text messages. A woman as stunning as you should be told every day, multiple times. To me, you\u2019re a queen and you should be treated as such.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and laughed at the same time as I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Peyton asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Connor and his game playing. Look at the text messages he\u2019s been sending me since this morning,\u201d I said as I handed Peyton my phone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so romantic. Why the restricted number, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. To keep it interesting, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me and then continued to tell me about her and Henry\u2019s honeymoon. Once we finished lunch, we walked out of the restaurant and parted ways. When I arrived home, I was greeted at the elevator by Mason and Julia.</p><p>\u201cGirl, wait until you see what\u2019s in the kitchen for you.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Curiosity got the best of me, so I put my purse down and walked to the kitchen. I gasped when I saw three dozen pink roses sitting in separate vases on the counter.</p><p>\u201cLooks like Connor has really outdone himself today,\u201d Mason said.</p><p>I walked over and pulled the card from one of the vases. It read:</p><p>To the most beautiful woman in the world.</p><p>No one will ever come close to your beauty.</p><p>My heart melted when I read that, and I couldn\u2019t wait until Connor came home. As I set the card down, I heard my phone beep. There was another text message from that same number.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful flowers for a beautiful woman. I want you to think of me every time you look at them.\u201d</p><p>A few hours had passed and Connor finally arrived home. As he stepped off the elevator, I wrapped my arms around him and hugged him tight before he even had the chance to put his briefcase down.</p><p>\u201cWow, now I like that greeting.\u201d He smiled as he kissed me. \u201cI thought I was going to get yelled at for not calling you all day. You wouldn\u2019t believe the shit going on at the office right now. I was in back-to-back meetings all day.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him and walked back to the kitchen to take the chicken out of the oven. Connor followed behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhere did those flowers come from?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom someone who thinks I\u2019m the most beautiful and exquisite woman in the world.\u201d I smiled as I set the chicken on the stove.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are, baby, but who sent them?\u201d</p><p>I turned around and looked at him. \u201cA hot and sexy man sent them to me, along with those romantic texts all day.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Connor got angry. \u201cEllery, I will ask you one last time: Who the f**k sent you those flowers and what texts are you talking about?!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe how upset he was. This was his game and he had the nerve to yell at me.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Connor, calm down. You\u2019re the one who sent them. Why are you yelling at me?\u201d</p><p>As he looked at me, his eyes turned dark. \u201cI didn\u2019t send you those flowers or any text messages today. I told you I was in back-to-back meetings all day!\u201d he yelled again. \u201cGive me your phone!\u201d he commanded.</p><p>He was scaring me and I didn\u2019t like it. With shaking hands, I opened the text messages on my phone and handed it to him. As he read them, the look on his face was daunting. He looked at me and then back at the flowers. He picked up the card from the counter and read it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen did these flowers come?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They were delivered when I was out with Peyton.\u201d</p><p>Connor pulled his phone from his pocket and dialed it. \u201cMason, it\u2019s Connor. Were you here when the flowers for Ellery were delivered? I see. Thank you,\u201d he said as he hung up.</p><p>\u201cHe said that when he and Julia got home from the park, they were outside the door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConnor, I thought they were from you along with the text messages. Now you\u2019re scaring me,\u201d I said as my bottom lip started to quiver.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would I send you text messages from a restricted number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were playing with me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as he paced around the kitchen, running his hands through his hair. \u201cThese aren\u2019t from me!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stand there and be yelled at anymore. I didn\u2019t know what was going on, so I took off up the stairs and went into my bedroom. After I locked the door, I threw myself on the bed, scared and shaking that someone, other than my husband, was saying those things to me and sending me my favorite flowers. While I was lying there, Connor knocked on the door.</p> <p>\u201cEllery, open the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Stay the hell away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, please. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to yell at you like that. We need to talk about this, so please open the door.\u201d</p><p>He sounded like he had calmed down, so I got up from the bed and unlocked the door. With a turn of the knob, he opened it as I sat on the edge of the bed. Connor walked in and sat on the bed next to me. He put his arm around me and pulled me into him as he held my head against his chest. I started to cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please forgive me, Ellery. You just have no idea the terrible thoughts that are going through my head right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou f**king scared me, Connor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know I did. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just the thought of someone saying that shit to you is unnerving, and I took it out on you, and I shouldn\u2019t have. Please, baby, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head up and Connor wiped the tears from my eyes. He took my face in his hands and softly kissed my lips.</p><p>\u201cWe need to find out who\u2019s doing this. I put a call into Detective James, the private investigator who worked with me on the Chicago fire. He\u2019s coming over in a while and so is Paul.\u201d</p><p>As I nodded my head, I got up from the bed and went into the bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror and tried to remove the mascara stains from under my eyes. The day that was going so well and made me so happy had all just gone to hell. Connor stood in the doorway of the bathroom and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Elle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look okay, Connor? Some stranger is stalking me, sending me text messages and my favorite flowers, and my husband just got done screaming at me. So to answer your question, no, I\u2019m not okay. I accept your apology, but I really just want you to leave me alone for a while so I can take in everything that just happened.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, we heard Julia cry from her crib. \u201cI\u2019ll tend to Julia and leave you alone,\u201d Connor said with an attitude.</p><p>I sighed as I closed my eyes and tried to figure out what the hell was going on. I needed to talk to Peyton, but my phone was downstairs. The last time I saw Connor that angry was back in the hotel room in Michigan. The way he yelled and the look he had in his eye brought back all the memories I never wanted to remember again. Once I finished wiping the mascara from underneath my eyes, I put my hair up in a ponytail and changed into my yoga pants and a sweatshirt. I walked past the living room. Connor was giving Julia her bottle. As I walked into the kitchen, I grabbed my phone from the counter and noticed the roses were gone.</p> <p>\u201cDid you throw the roses away?\u201d I asked Connor as I walked over to the bar.</p><p>\u201cYou bet I did,\u201d he replied.</p><p>The bottle of Jack was already sitting out and so was a shot glass. As I poured myself a shot, I looked over at my husband. \u201cDid you get this out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I figured you\u2019d be coming down for some,\u201d he replied as he looked down at Julia.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said as I threw the shot back and set the glass down. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d I blurted out as I poured another shot.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>Connor</p><p>I looked over at Ellery and saw the fear in her eyes. I wanted to go to her, but I was feeding Julia. I never should\u2019ve yelled at her the way I did. But when I read those messages and saw the flowers and the card, a fear crept up inside of me that someone was after my wife. Ellery continued to slam a couple of shots as I burped Julia. She had just finished her bottle, so I set her on the floor amongst her toys. Ellery stood behind the bar, and I walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I said as I embraced her. \u201cI know this whole thing is scary, but I promise you that I\u2019ll never let anything happen to you or Julia. We\u2019re going to find out who\u2019s behind this and they\u2019re going to pay. I\u2019ll see to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would do something like this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, baby; some sick, twisted individual,\u201d I said as I tightened my grip around her.</p><p>The doorman rang up and said that Detective James and Paul were downstairs. I told him to send them up right away.</p><p>\u201cMr. Black, it\u2019s nice to see you again,\u201d Detective James said as he shook my hand.</p><p>\u201cI wish it was under better circumstances,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>Paul walked over to Ellery and gave her a hug. \u201cAre you okay, Elle?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I escorted the detective to the living room and offered him a drink. Paul got up, walked over to the bar, and poured himself a glass of bourbon.</p><p>\u201cDetective James, you remember my wife, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. It\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Ellery gave a small smile as she nodded her head. I sat down beside her and held her hand.</p><p>\u201cYour husband has filled me in on what\u2019s going on. Can I see the messages you received today?\u201d</p><p>Ellery reached over, took her phone from the table, and handed it to him. As Detective James scrolled through the messages, I got up, walked into the kitchen, and grabbed the card that came with the flowers.</p><p>\u201cHe sent her three dozen roses with this card attached,\u201d I said as I handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cHave you met anyone new recently?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI meet people every day, detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the showing at the art gallery?\u201d Paul said as he looked at Ellery.</p><p>\u201cI met and talked to a lot of people there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you notice anyone as being odd or felt like something was off with someone?\u201d Detective James asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not that I can remember,\u201d Ellery replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a screenshot of these messages. You didn\u2019t change your number already, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was going to do that first thing tomorrow morning,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t. We need to see how far this person will go. It could just be a couple of messages and then he\u2019s done with it. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t do anything unless he threatens her in some way.\u201d</p><p>Julia started getting fussy, so Ellery picked her up. She said she was taking her upstairs to change her diaper. As soon as she was out of earshot, I looked at Detective James and said sternly, \u201cI will use every resource I have to find out who\u2019s doing this. I will not stand by and wait until he harms Ellery or Julia. I don\u2019t give a shit about the law and I\u2019ll warn you now, if I catch him first, I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear that,\u201d Detective James said. \u201cMy men and I will be on this. After all, you\u2019re paying us very well,\u201d he said as he got up from the chair. \u201cI\u2019ll start first thing in the morning, and I\u2019ll try to find out where those flowers came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Detective James,\u201d I said as I shook his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Connor. We\u2019ll find this son of a bitch. Try not to worry.\u201d</p><p>As I shut the door, Ellery walked into the room with Julia. \u201cDid Detective James leave?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby, he did,\u201d I replied as I walked over to her and gave her a kiss and took Julia.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, Connor?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cFind me a bodyguard for Ellery and Julia. I\u2019ll need two of them. One to go out with Ellery and one for Mason. I want you to get our tech guys on these messages and find out what number they\u2019re coming from, and I want to know where the flowers came from. I\u2019m not going into the office tomorrow, so report back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get on it right away,\u201d Paul said. He walked over to Ellery and gave her a hug. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about this; we\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Paul. I appreciate it.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>Paul walked out the door, and Ellery wrapped her arms around my waist. \u201cDo you really think it\u2019s necessary to hire a bodyguard?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I\u2019m not taking any chances, and I can\u2019t be with you twenty-four-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you could be,\u201d she said as she kissed my lips.</p><p>\u201cI do too, baby. I do too.\u201d</p><p>Ellery tossed and turned all night. I tried to keep her still by holding her, but she was so restless that she would wiggle her way out of my grip. When I got out of the shower, Ellery was sitting up in bed with her phone in her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did you get another text?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She held out her phone to me, and I walked over and took it from her. Sure enough, there was another message.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you all night. I hope you were thinking about me.\u201d</p><p>I threw the phone on the bed and ran my hands through my hair. Reading those words that were being said to my wife fueled my anger even more. I took in a deep breath as I walked over to the dresser and pulled out a pair of jeans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting that bastard run my life, Connor.\u201d</p><p>I turned around and looked at her. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live in fear and I won\u2019t. I\u2019m stronger than that, and I won\u2019t let some obsessive sick f**k control my life.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to the bed, sat down, and put my arm her. \u201cEllery, I\u2019m sorry this is happening, but you\u2019ll be protected at all times. You\u2019re not allowed to leave this penthouse or building without security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were really serious about having someone follow me around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot following you around, sweetheart; protecting you,\u201d I said as I kissed the side of her head. \u201cNow go and get dressed. We have to go visit Denny.\u201d</p><p>When we heard Mason downstairs, Ellery threw on some clothes, and we walked into the kitchen, where he was dancing with Julia.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Momma. Good morning, Daddy.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mason. We need to talk to you,\u201d I said as I grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down at the table.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good. Did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Ellery took Julia from him and asked him to sit down. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you did. Do you remember those text messages I received from the restricted number?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I remember,\u201d he said with a confused look.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t from me,\u201d I chimed in.</p><p>Mason shifted in his seat as he stared at me. \u201cWho were they from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Ellery said as she kissed Julia on the head.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, the roses. They weren\u2019t from you either?\u201d</p><p>As I sipped my coffee, I shook my head. \u201cNo, they weren\u2019t.

What can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a detective working on it, but I\u2019m hiring a bodyguard for you and Julia. Ellery will have her own, just until we find out who\u2019s behind this.\u201d</p><p>My phone rang and, as I pulled it from my pocket, I saw Paul was calling. \u201cHello, Paul.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Connor. I have two guys lined up as security if you want to interview them. We can be at your place in about fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good; we\u2019ll be here,\u201d I said as I hung up. \u201cPaul is on his way over with two men he wants me to interview. When we\u2019re done, we\u2019ll head over to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Ellery nodded her head while she poured herself a cup of coffee. Mason took Julia upstairs to change her diaper, and I walked to my office. I was going over some paperwork when Ellery walked in with Paul and two large men. I stood up from my chair and walked over to them. Their grip was strong as I shook both of their hands.</p><p>\u201cMr. Black, it\u2019s an honor to meet you, sir,\u201d they both said.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming. Please have a seat. I\u2019m sure Paul has filled you in on what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, he has. We want you to know that we have specialized backgrounds in dealing with someone like this and we\u2019d be more than happy to protect your wife and child. Justin and I are both ex-navy seals whom served with the U.S. Special Operations Forces for over twenty years.\u201d</p> <p>As I sat there and listened to their background, I felt they\u2019d be the right choice for Ellery and Julia. \u201cEllery, what you do you think?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019d be a good choice,\u201d she replied as she looked at both of them and smiled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re hired,\u201d I said as I stood up and shook their hands. \u201cYou\u2019ll both start tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Black. Don\u2019t worry, Mrs. Black; we aren\u2019t going to let anything happen. You\u2019ll be very safe with us.\u201d</p><p>Ellery gave a small smile and walked out of the office. I could tell uneasiness washed over her. I asked Paul to shut the door while I talked to Justin and Adam.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you must be aware of. My wife is a very stubborn woman who does whatever she wants. She doesn\u2019t like to listen to anybody when it comes to her safety. She\u2019s independent and strong-willed, so good luck. Don\u2019t let her fool you.\u201d</p><p>While both of the men laughed, I walked them out of the office and to the elevator. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>We visited Denny and nothing had changed. He was still in a coma and the doctors couldn\u2019t give us any answers. Dana asked us if we would join her in the cafeteria for some coffee. I told Ellery to go ahead, but to stay with Dana at all times. I sat in the chair and stared at Denny and put my hand on top of his.</p> <p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d wake up. There\u2019s so much going on that I need to talk to you about. Ellery is being stalked. He keeps sending her text messages, and yesterday, he had three dozen roses delivered to the penthouse. If there was ever a time I needed your smart mouth and advice, it\u2019s now. I\u2019m so scared, Denny. If anything ever happened to her, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better find that bastard,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I jumped up from the chair as Denny slowly opened his eyes and looked at me. A smile filled my face as I squeezed his hand. I pushed the button for the nurse, and Ellery and Dana walked in.</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s awake.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Dana burst into tears as she ran over to the bed. Ellery walked over and touched his other hand lightly.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>The nurse and doctor walked into the room and examined Denny. He seemed to be okay, except he was complaining of a horrific headache. The doctor told him it was normal and they\u2019d give him something for the pain. He and Dana stared at each other while she cried and told him how much she loved him. I wanted to give them some alone time, so I told Denny and Dana that we\u2019d be back later. As soon as Ellery and I stepped into the hallway, I grabbed her and pulled her into a warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cThank God he woke up,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>Ellery</p><p>As we drove home, I heard my phone beeping. The restricted number appeared on the screen. Connor looked over at me and could tell by the look on my face that something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>As I read the message, I instantly felt sick to my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI masturbate to your picture, and you make me come so fast. I hope that turns you on. I dream about seeing your nak*d body and pressing it up against mine. I dream about being inside of you.\u201d</p><p>When I didn\u2019t say anything, Connor grabbed the phone from my hand just as we pulled into the garage of the penthouse. The anger that washed over his face was horrifying. I watched him take in a sharp breath and clench his fist.</p><p>\u201cConnor, calm down, right now,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cHow do you expect me to calm down when some guy says he masturbates to my wife\u2019s picture and dreams about being inside you,\u201d he yelled as he slammed his fists on the steering wheel. \u201cI can\u2019t just sit back and watch this. I need to do something.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stand seeing him so angry. When we got out of the Ranger Rover, I stopped him before we reached the elevator, and I wrapped my arms around him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Connor. Detective James is going to find this son of a bitch. Please stop being so angry. I know you\u2019re scared and so am I, but I don\u2019t need you going all crazy on me.\u201d</p><p>He held me tightly; so tightly, I could barely breathe. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>We broke our embrace and went up to the penthouse.</p><p>\u201cI hope you two didn\u2019t eat lunch. I made the most scrumptious salad for you,\u201d Mason said as he emerged from the kitchen.</p><p>I smiled as we sat down at the table and he served us.</p><p>\u201cIs Julia taking a nap?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. The princess is down for her nap,\u201d he replied as he sat down next to me.</p><p>My phone beeped, alerting me I had a text message. Connor\u2019s eyes glared at me as I read it. \u201cRelax, it\u2019s from Peyton. She wants to drop by.\u201d</p><p>Connor let out a sigh of relief as I secretly did as well. I wanted nothing more than to get my number changed. Suddenly, Connor\u2019s phone started ringing from his pocket. He pulled it out and said it was Detective James. After a brief conversation, he hung up and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cThey were able to trace the text messages to a cell phone out of Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must\u2019ve been there that night at the gallery,\u201d I said.</p><p>As we talked, Peyton came walking into the kitchen. We all stopped and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cHi. What\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Connor and Mason both said hello to her, and I told her to have a seat. Mason got up, took a plate from the cupboard, and served Peyton some salad.</p><p>\u201cThose text messages weren\u2019t from Connor. Someone is stalking me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cStop it. That\u2019s not even funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not joking, Peyton. This is serious,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>Peyton looked at me and then reached over and hugged me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. Do you know who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But we just found out that the texts were coming from a cell phone in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould it be someone from the gallery opening? Wait!\u201d Peyton exclaimed as she took out her phone. \u201cI remember this really weird guy there. I was on my way back from the bathroom and I saw this guy, standing in the corner,\u201d she said as she showed Connor and me her phone. \u201cHe was taking pictures with his phone. It caught my attention because he had one hand on his crotch, like he was playing with himself. I thought it was funny, so I took his picture. I was going to show you, but Henry distracted me and I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho or what was he taking pictures of?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I do remember looking over to where he was pointing his phone and Ellery was over there.\u201d</p><p>Connor got up from his seat, walked over to Peyton, and wrapped his arms tightly around her as he kissed her on the cheek. \u201cDo you know how much I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...sure,\u201d she said as she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cSend that picture to my phone, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, as soon as you stop smothering me,\u201d Peyton said.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Peyton.\u201d Connor smiled as he looked at me. \u201cI\u2019m going to call Detective James and then I\u2019m flying to Chicago. I want to see those tapes from that night. I\u2019m calling my pilot now to get the plane ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Mason, can you stay here tonight and watch Julia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can. You two go and don\u2019t worry about a thing.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Connor and I packed a light bag and stopped by the hospital to see Denny before heading to the airport. We told him what was going on and where we were going. He smiled at us and told us to be careful. Seeing him awake and looking well took one weight off of our shoulders.</p><p>We boarded the plane, and I took my seat while Connor poured me a glass of wine and himself a scotch. When we finally took off, we unbuckled our seat belts and sat on the couch. I drank some wine, handed the glass to Connor, and laid my head down on his lap. As I stared up at him, he started playing with my hair.</p><p>\u201cYou tossed and turned all night,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry if I kept you up.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and brought his mouth to mine, kissing me tenderly on the lips. \u201cI won\u2019t give up until this a**hole is found. No one is allowed to dream of you but me.\u201d</p><p>I brought my hand up to his face and softly stroked his cheek. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you more, Mrs. Black.\u201d Connor smiled down at me. He looked at his watch and then back at me. \u201cWe have an hour until we land in Chicago. I\u2019m thinking about taking you into the bedroom and making love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d Connor said as he ran his finger over my lips.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you waiting for? Take me. I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine. Mine forever, and nobody will ever take you from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d I whispered as I kissed him on the lips.</p><p>As I walked around the art gallery, Connor talked to Vinnie. He told Connor that the guy in the picture was the lighting man, and he was taking pictures of the way the lighting was set up so he could show a prospective client.</p><p>\u201cI can call him in if you want to speak to him,\u201d Vinnie said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain why the man was holding his crotch like that. Who does that in a public place?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cHe has testicular cancer, and I know he\u2019s frequently in pain. So that\u2019s probably why he was doing that. Why are you asking about him anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s been sending text messages and flowers to my wife. The texts are sex related and when I saw this picture, I automatically assumed it was him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be him,\u201d Vinnie said. \u201cDid I mention that he\u2019s gay?\u201d</p> <p>Connor looked at me with a disappointed expression. I thought for sure it was the lighting man, and this would finally be over. A beep came from my purse, which alerted me that I had a text message. As I fumbled for it, I took out my phone and there was a text from him.</p><p>\u201cI stare at your picture and imagine what it would be like to f**k you and hear you moan. I think about you all day, and I can\u2019t stop. Your smile drives me insane and your mouth around my c*ck is what I crave and desire.\u201d</p><p>My panicked face gave it away that the message was from him. Connor grabbed my phone and I stood there as rage took over his face and settled into his eyes. He put his arm around me and pulled me into him. \u201cWhen I find out who\u2019s doing this, I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>We thanked Vinnie and left the gallery. When we stepped outside, Connor called Detective James and told him about the latest text message and how the man from the art gallery wasn\u2019t the guy. The text messages were starting to get more graphic, and now I was getting more frightened than before. As soon as Connor hung up the phone with Detective James, he pulled me into him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get some dinner and then we\u2019ll head back to New York.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded my head and we walked down the street to a Mexican restaurant. I really wasn\u2019t hungry, so I only ordered the tacos. As we were eating, I kept noticing two girls sitting at the table next to us, eyeing Connor. I had sort of gotten used to the fact that my husband was the sexiest man alive and that women appreciated his looks, but I drew the line when they wouldn\u2019t stop staring at him, even though I was sitting directly across from him.</p><p>\u201cThose two women keep staring at you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s irritating, and I\u2019m going to say something if they don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. There will be no embarrassing me tonight. Now eat your tacos!\u201d</p><p>I glared at him from across the table as I took a bite of my taco. He glared at me as he drank his beer. The waiter came over and asked if we wanted dessert. I took the liberty of ordering two desserts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ellery, I don\u2019t want dessert; I\u2019m full,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cYou can never be too full for dessert.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>After a few moments, the waiter set our desserts down on the table. Connor looked at me and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby, but I really don\u2019t want this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said as I grabbed his and my desserts and took them over to the women at the next table.</p><p>\u201cI would like you to have these desserts on me and my husband. I couldn\u2019t help but notice your incessant staring at him as we were trying to enjoy our dinner. Kudos for making asses of yourselves!\u201d</p><p>The women looked away as I winked at them, grabbed my purse, and told Connor we were leaving. I heard him apologize as he walked past their table. I stepped outside the doors of the restaurant and Connor caught up with me. I put my hand up as I walked down the street.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, say a word, Black. They deserved it. I don\u2019t appreciate gawkers, especially when it\u2019s directed at my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you walking to?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I stopped and looked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said as I threw my hands up in the air and laughed.</p><p>Connor wrapped his arms around me and hugged me tightly. \u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same thing you\u2019ve always done. Love me forever, no matter how much I embarrass you.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, sweet wife. I will love you, no matter how much you embarrass me, until the day I die.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>The next few days were pretty much the same. The text messages were becoming more frequent and more graphic. Denny was doing better and was expected to be released in a few days. Connor was working hard at the office, not only on trying to keep up with Black Enterprises, but he was also under a lot of stress trying to find out who was sending me the messages. My security guy, Justin, followed me everywhere I went, and Detective James wasn\u2019t any closer to finding out who was stalking me.</p><p>Connor and I took Julia to the toy store one night. As we were walking around and Connor was showing Julia all the toys that made noise, my phone beeped with a message. I looked at my phone and read the text message that sat on my screen.</p><p>\u201cMy hunger for you is getting worse. My love for you is growing stronger, and I\u2019m going crazy not being able to touch you.\u201d</p><p>Connor was occupied with Julia and a singing toy, so he didn\u2019t hear my phone beep. We were having a good night. I didn\u2019t want to show him the message and worry him even more than he already was. Julia laughed at the singing bear that Connor held up in front of her. When he went to put it back on the shelf, she screamed.</p><p>\u201cLook what you did; now you have to buy it for her,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t get a new toy every time she screams. She has to learn what \u2018no\u2019 means,\u201d he said as he pushed the shopping cart away from the singing bear.</p><p>Julia wasn\u2019t having it, and I knew he would eventually give in and buy it for her. As we walked down another aisle, Julia threw a temper tantrum. I walked behind Connor, whispering in his ear, \u201cI want that bear, Daddy. Please buy me that bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllery, knock it off. That\u2019s not fair. She needs to learn she can\u2019t have everything she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You get everything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different. I\u2019m an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d I smiled as I slapped him on the ass and walked ahead of them.</p><p>I could hear Julia from the next aisle over. As I was looking at the dolls, it suddenly became quiet. The sounds of a screaming baby were gone. I rolled my eyes and made my way back to where Connor and Julia were. I saw the singing bear next to her.</p><p>\u201cWay to go, Daddy. I knew you\u2019d give in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t stop screaming. Next time, no means no,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right!\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Dinner with Julia was out of the question. She looked really tired, and she was starting to get fussy. Both of us knew that if we took her to a restaurant, we wouldn\u2019t be there long, so we headed home and decided to order a pizza. While I fed Julia in her highchair, Connor placed an order for delivery, and I decided to tell him about the text message I received earlier. After I made him promise not to get angry and go off on a tangent, I read him the message. He slammed his fists on the counter so hard, he made me and Julia jump. Julia started screaming and I looked at him, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby. Daddy didn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d he said as he walked over to her and kissed her head.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I warned you. I begged you not to get angry like that,\u201d I said as I slammed the spoon down on the table and got up.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Ellery? How do you not expect me to get angry when someone talks to you like that? Damn it. What if this was happening to me by some strange woman? How the f**k would you feel? Huh? Answer me that,\u201d he yelled. \u201cWe have this same argument all the time. You tell me not to get mad, I do, and then you get pissed off, and it results in me yelling at you.\u201d</p><p>Anger overtook me as I walked over to him. \u201cLet me make one thing very clear to you. There will never be yelling or fighting in front of Julia. Do you understand me?\u201d I said through gritted teeth as I pushed my finger into his chest.</p><p>While he stood there and looked at me, I could see him start to slowly calm down. \u201cYou\u2019re right, and I apologize to you and Julia,\u201d he said as he kissed my forehead and then Julia\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll take her upstairs and get her cleaned up and ready for bed. The pizza should be here shortly,\u201d he said.</p><p>The doorbell rang and when I answered it, I was shocked to see Phil standing there, holding our pizza.</p><p>\u201cHi, Phil,\u201d I said as I gave him a strange look. \u201cWhat are you doing here and why are you holding our pizzas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Ellery. I was just down in the lobby and heard the delivery guy say he had pizzas for the Blacks, so I saved him a trip up since I was coming up to see Connor anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Phil.\u201d I smiled as I took the pizzas from him. \u201cConnor will be down in a minute. He\u2019s changing Julia. How much do I owe you?\u201d I asked as I reached for my wallet.</p><p>\u201cOh, please, don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s on me.\u201d</p><p>Connor walked down the stairs and was surprised to see Phil standing in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cPhil, what brings you here, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some papers you need to sign,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t wait until morning?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to get these faxed over to Japan tonight, and when I went to your office earlier to have you sign them, you\u2019d already left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit and have some pizza with us,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cNah, I don\u2019t want to interfere with your dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not interfering, Phil. Now sit down and let me get you a drink.\u201d Connor insisted.</p><p>I took the paper plates and napkins to the living room. Phil followed behind me with the pizza boxes. Connor poured himself a scotch and made Phil a martini. I sat down on the floor, at the coffee table. Connor asked me what I wanted to drink. When I told him a coke, Phil jumped up and said he\u2019d get it. We sat around the coffee table and talked while we ate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you sitting on the floor, eating pizza, Connor,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cEllery likes things very informal,\u201d Connor responded.</p><p>\u201cYep, I don\u2019t like all that uppity shit.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell, Connor has changed quite a bit since he married you,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>I looked over at Connor and smiled. \u201cHe sure has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very lucky man to be married to such a beautiful woman.\u201d Phil smiled.</p><p>When he said that, I blushed. \u201cPhil, stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, Ellery. You are incredibly beautiful, and any man would be lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you. But I\u2019m the lucky one.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Connor got up and walked over to the bar to make Phil another drink, while Phil helped me bring the plates and pizza back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThank you for inviting me to stay. It meant a lot to me, Ellery,\u201d Phil said as he hugged me tightly.</p><p>As I stood there, astounded, I gently patted his back and told him that he was welcome. Connor walked in and handed Phil his drink.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here?\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cI was thanking your beautiful wife for having me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was our pleasure, Phil. You know you\u2019re always welcome here.\u201d</p><p>He drank part of his drink, set it on the table, and then announced he had to leave. Connor showed him to the door and gave him the money for the pizza.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Connor said as he shut the door.</p><p>He turned around and looked at me as I walked over to him and collapsed in his arms.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. I think I\u2019ll go take a hot bath,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby. I\u2019ll be up in a while. I have some papers I need to go over and then I\u2019m going to call Detective James.\u201d</p><p>When I reached the top of the stairs, I stopped in the nursery to check on Julia. She was sound asleep. I started the bath water, poured a capful of bubble bath, and stepped into the tub. As I lay back, I slowly closed my eyes and took in a deep relaxing breath. All I wanted to do was escape into a world where it was only the three of us. As I was dreaming about my alternate world, Connor walked into the bathroom and sat on the edge of the tub.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying your bath?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. I was dreaming about our alternate world.\u201d</p> <p>Connor looked at me strangely. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invented a world where it\u2019s only me, you, and Julia. Just the three of us, living happily ever after.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI love your imagination,\u201d he said as he lightly ran his finger up and down my arm. \u201cAre you imagining the things I\u2019m doing to you in your alternate world? Are you imagining me making passionate love to you all night long because I can\u2019t get enough of you? Are you imagining me whispering \u2018I love you\u2019 in your ear as I\u2019m slowly moving in and out you?\u201d</p><p>Whenever Connor talked like that, in that tone, he always put me in a trance. It was like I was frozen by his words and I was unable to move. As he spoke, he fondled my breast. While he stared into my eyes, he ran his thumb over my puckered nipple and leaned over to kiss my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get out of the bath now,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not done yet?\u201d I whispered back.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re done, Mrs. Black, because I\u2019m going to take you to your alternate world and do things to you there I\u2019ve never done before. I\u2019m going to make it so you don\u2019t want to come back.\u201d</p><p>I gasped as he took my hand and stood me up. He grabbed the towel I had sitting next to the tub, wrapped it around me, and helped me out. He dried every part of me in a seductive manner and removed the clip that was holding my hair up, letting it fall over my shoulders. He took in a sharp breath as he placed his hand on the side of my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so in love with you, and I need you. I need you every day. You\u2019re my strength and my light and, without you, I\u2019m nothing.\u201d</p><p>As I smiled at him, he picked me up and carried me to our bed. He gently laid me down as his fingers deftly removed my towel, and he took me to my alternate world. He was right; I didn\u2019t want to come back.</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>Connor</p><p>\u201cYou were right, Connor,\u201d Paul said as he walked into my office and threw the file on my desk.</p><p>I sat there and shook my head as I read the contents inside. \u201cFuck!\u201d I yelled as I slammed it down.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it either. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d I said as I paced back and forth.</p><p>Since I had taken my father\u2019s place as CEO of Black Enterprises, I had never needed to ask for his advice, until now. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and dialed him.</p><p>\u201cDad, I need you to come down to the office. I need to talk to you about a situation that\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Connor, I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>As I hung up the phone, I walked out to where Valerie sat. \u201cMy father will be here shortly. Cancel my meeting for this afternoon and do me a favor and order us some sandwiches from the deli down the street. Nobody, and I mean nobody is to disturb us, not even Phil, do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Mrs. Black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course her, but she usually just calls my cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, Connor. I\u2019ll get on those sandwiches now.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I walked back into my office and sat down at my desk. \u201cI want you in on this meeting with my father, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much. Do you want me to call anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is to stay between the three of us.\u201d</p><p>About an hour later, my father came strolling into my office and Valerie entered with the sandwiches. We took a seat at the table and my father looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Connor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a look at this,\u201d I said as I slid the file across the table. \u201cRemember the conversation we had a couple of weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>My father opened the file, looked at it, and then looked at me with an expression of shock. \u201cAre you f**king kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at a loss for words, son. I don\u2019t know what to think about this.\u201d</p><p>As I got up from my seat, I walked over to the bar and poured a scotch.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I can see the rage in your eyes and the first thing you need to do is to calm down. You won\u2019t do anybody any good if you start acting crazy and out of control. Think of the situation and repercussions if you go off the deep end.\u201d</p><p>He was right. I needed to calm myself and think this through very carefully. I sat back down and the three of us discussed the matter further, trying to formulate a plan of action. Once I was satisfied with what we came up with, my father and Paul left the office, and I made a couple of phone calls. One of the phone calls I made was to Denny to see if he was up for a visit; I hadn\u2019t seen him since the first day he was released from the hospital.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking better every day,\u201d I said to him as I handed him a bottle of his favorite bourbon.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Connor.\u201d He smiled. \u201cHow are Ellery and Julia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good. I need to talk to you about a situation and something that\u2019s going on over at Black Enterprises.\u201d I sighed as I sat down in the chair across from him.</p><p>Denny had always been like a father to me. He\u2019d done things for me in my younger days that my father would\u2019ve killed me for if he knew. He\u2019d always had my back and was there when I needed him; a strong-willed man and a person who would give you the shirt off his back if you asked him for it. Nobody in this world, except Ellery, knew how important Denny was to me and that was because he\u2019d become a father figure to her as well. We talked for over an hour, and as I explained the situation to him, he was shocked, just like Paul, my father, and I were.</p><p>\u201cYou know what you have to do, Connor. You better be careful and, if I was strong enough, I would help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t doing a thing. I can take care of this. I need you to get better because driving in that New York City traffic is killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you hire another driver until I can come back?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want another driver, Denny.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI need to get home to my wife and daughter. Enjoy the bourbon, and I\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d I said as I walked out the door.</p><p>The drive home was terrible. As I stepped off the elevator and into the penthouse, I heard Ellery\u2019s sweet voice singing to Julia. When I walked into the living room, I stood in the archway and watched as Ellery danced around the room with Julia. As I leaned up against the wall, Ellery saw me and smiled.</p><p>\u201cLook, Julia, your daddy\u2019s home,\u201d she said as she turned so Julia could see me.</p><p>Julia screeched so loud that it was enough to pierce anyone\u2019s eardrums. Ellery danced over to me and I took Julia from her.</p><p>\u201cYou are awfully loud, little girl.\u201d I smiled as I held her up in the air. She continued to screech as drool came from her mouth and onto my face.</p><p>Ellery laughed as she handed me a cloth diaper. \u201cYou know she drools a lot when she\u2019s teething.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to ruin the moment, but I had to ask her. \u201cDid you get any more texts today?\u201d</p><p>Ellery nodded her head as she walked over to the table and grabbed her phone. I took the phone from her hand and handed Julia back to her. I stood, outraged, as I read the messages.</p><p>\u201cDearest Ellery, I want you on your knees, in front of me, sucking me off until I explode inside your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what a sexual creature you are to me, Ellery. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to crave something you can\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to tie you up and whip you until you bleed. Then I\u2019ll make your wounds better with my tongue as you come from the pleasure you\u2019re going to feel.\u201d</p><p>My skin grew hot and my pulse started racing, but I stayed calm, for Ellery\u2019s sake. She looked at me with tears in her eyes as I handed her the phone back. I took Julia from her arms and set her amongst her toys on the floor. When I turned around, I wrapped my arms around her and held her tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a rock. You have more strength over this than I do, and I\u2019m so proud of you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Julia keep me strong,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>As I broke our embrace, I told Ellery that I needed to talk to her as we sat down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI need to take a business trip, and I need to leave tomorrow. It\u2019s something urgent that came up with the Chicago office and I need to be there to straighten it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I want you to, you\u2019ll be safer here. I\u2019ll be tied up in meetings and I won\u2019t be able to keep an eye on you. I won\u2019t be gone long, only a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll miss you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you too, baby. It\u2019s only one night.\u201d I hated leaving her, but I had no choice.</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>Ellery</p><p>As I packed Julia\u2019s diaper bag, Connor walked into the nursery, holding her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you and my baby aren\u2019t going to be here tonight.\u201d I pouted.</p><p>\u201cJust think of the fun you and Peyton will have. You can watch scary movies, make popcorn, and do whatever it is you women do,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I sighed as I handed him the diaper bag.</p><p>Mason was downstairs and eagerly waiting for Connor to hand over Julia. \u201cCome here, princess. We\u2019re going to have so much fun! Ellery, don\u2019t worry about her. You and Peyton have a fabulous time tonight,\u201d he said as he took the diaper bag, kissed me on the cheek, and stepped into the elevator with Julia.</p><p>I kissed her goodbye and, as soon as they left, I said my goodbyes to Connor. \u201cHave a safe trip, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. You behave yourself while I\u2019m gone and don\u2019t forget that Justin will be outside the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d I winked.</p><p>When the elevator came back up, Connor stepped into it and pushed the button. Just before the doors were about to close, he stopped them.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to tell you that Phil is stopping by tonight to drop off some papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll set them in your office.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Connor let go of the doors and they started to close, he stuck his hand in between them to stop them from closing, stepped out, and hugged me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, it\u2019s only for one night. You said yourself not to worry. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just hate being away from you,\u201d he said as he kissed my head.</p> <p>\u201cI hate being away from you too, but you have to go. Now come on. Put your big boy pants on and go; you\u2019re making things harder,\u201d I said as I broke our embrace and patted him on the chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, Elle, you\u2019re the one making things harder.\u201d He winked as he looked down at the bulge in his pants.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, Black.\u201d I laughed as he stepped onto the elevator.</p><p>A couple of hours had passed, and I took a nap. It had been forever since I took a nap without having to worry if Julia was going to wake up. I took the stairs down to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator for a bottle of water. After checking my phone to see if I had any messages, I walked into the living room, turned on the fireplace, and sat down on the couch with a magazine. Being alone and not knowing what to do wasn\u2019t sitting right with me, so I grabbed my keys and headed to my studio. When I stepped out the door, I told Justin that I was going down to my art studio. He nodded his head and followed me.</p><p>I set a blank canvas on the easel, took out my paints and brush, and started painting how I saw my alternate world. Each brush stroke helped me escape the dark reality of what was happening in my life. I looked at the clock and I\u2019d been painting for two hours. It suddenly hit me that Phil was coming over to drop off some papers. I put my brush down and stepped outside the apartment. Justin wasn\u2019t at the door, and I didn\u2019t have time to look for him. I took the elevator up to the penthouse and as I unlocked the door, Phil walked up and startled me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ellery. Did I startle you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a bit.\u201d I laughed. \u201cCome on in. I\u2019m just going to go to the kitchen and wash up. I was painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine. Please take your time.\u201d</p><p>I walked into the kitchen and, as I was washing my hands, Phil walked in. \u201cSo, do you have the place to yourself tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Connor\u2019s on that business trip and Julia is spending the night at Mason\u2019s. My friend Peyton is coming over and we\u2019re having a girl\u2019s night,\u201d I said as I dried off my hands.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019ll have a great night. When is Peyton coming over?\u201d</p> <p>A strange look overtook my face, as I couldn\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d ask or even care. \u201cShe\u2019ll be here soon. Do you have those papers for Connor?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I left\u2014umm\u2014they\u2019re in the living room,\u201d he said nervously.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, thank you for dropping them off, Phil. Peyton\u2019s going to be here shortly, so I better get ready,\u201d I said uneasily.</p><p>Something didn\u2019t sit right with me. Phil was acting weird. I\u2019d always thought he was strange, but Connor always defended him and said he\u2019d had a bad childhood.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Ellery. It\u2019s always a pleasure to see you,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I making you uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>I stopped, turned around, and looked at him as he slowly walked towards me. \u201cNo, of course not. Why would you make me uncomfortable? We\u2019ve known each other for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we have, and it hasn\u2019t been until recently that I\u2019ve grown quite fond of you,\u201d he said as he took a strand of my hair between his fingers.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right, and now wasn\u2019t the time to freak out. I needed to remain calm and think clearly. My heart started racing, and I started to sweat. \u201cPeyton is on her way. You really need to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go, Ellery. I was hoping that with Connor out of town, we could get to know each other better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know you well enough, and it\u2019s time you left,\u201d I said nervously as I began to walk past him.</p><p>He grabbed my arm. His grip was tight as his fingers dug into my arm. \u201cDid you enjoy my text messages and the roses? I wanted to send you more, but I couldn\u2019t run the risk of Connor finding out it was me who wanted his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you were the one who sent me all those text messages?\u201d I asked in disbelief and shock.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why?\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling arose in my stomach, and I needed to sit down because I felt like I was going to pass out. \u201cI need to sit down,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m sure this is overwhelming for you. You asked me why. The answer is simple; you\u2019re beautiful, sensitive, loving, and giving. Do you know how hard it is to find someone like you in this f**ked up world we live in? Do you know how I\u2019ve searched for that special woman my whole life? To think of all the whores I\u2019ve f**ked, trying to find out if there was anything special about them. Then, all of a sudden, there you were. The more I watched your interaction with Connor, the deeper I fell for you.\u201d</p><p>I began to shake as he walked over and sat down next to me. \u201cLook at you, you\u2019re trembling,\u201d he said as he tried to pull me into him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d I screamed as I flew off the couch.</p><p>\u201cI need to touch you. I want to touch you. I want to know what it feels like to be inside you. I want to feel your come all over my c*ck and I want to hear you scream when I f**k you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d I said as I tried to run to the door.</p><p>He followed me and grabbed me from behind, covering my mouth with his hand. \u201cNow be a good girl and do as I say. Connor will never have to know about this, because if you say a word to him or the police, you\u2019ll never see that precious baby girl of yours again.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened when he said that, and I struggled to get out from his grip. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Ellery. I know she means the world to you, and your love for her is stronger than any other love on this Earth. Do you promise not to scream?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head as I tried to formulate a plan. He slowly removed his hand from my mouth and ran it down my cheek. Suddenly, I went ballistic.</p><p>\u201cYou mother f**ker! There\u2019s one thing you don\u2019t do and that\u2019s threaten a mother with her child!\u201d I screamed as I rammed my knee into his crotch. He doubled over in pain, and I ran to the door. As I tried to open it, he slammed it shut.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ellery, don\u2019t make this difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d I started to cry as I slowly backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cNot crazy; just in love. You know that it\u2019s a proven fact that love can make a person crazy. Look at what it did to Ashlyn. Now, she\u2019s one crazy bitch. But I didn\u2019t blame her after everything Connor did to her. The way he led her on, took her out, and then f**ked her brains out every chance he got. No wonder the girl was messed up.\u201d</p><p>I could barely swallow. It felt like my throat was closing up. I needed to get to my phone that was in the kitchen. As I turned around and tried to run, Phil grabbed me from behind and threw me on the floor.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop struggling and enjoy what I\u2019m about to do to you. I promise you\u2019ll love it and then all this struggle would\u2019ve been for nothing.\u201d</p><p>I lay there, kicking and trying to hit him before he held my wrists above my head with his hand, and he fumbled with the button on my jeans. The tears were falling from my eyes as I looked around the room. While I was struggling, thoughts of Connor and Julia flooded my mind. Suddenly, the door flew open and Connor pulled Phil off of me and punched him as hard as he could. Phil went down and Connor got on top of him. He grabbed Phil\u2019s shirt and continuously punched him in the face, again and again as he screamed.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch! How dare you touch my wife?\u201d he said with each punch.</p><p>Detective James ran in and pulled Connor off of him. Justin followed behind and handcuffed Phil.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a piece of shit, and I\u2019m going to make sure you rot in jail for the rest of your life for what you\u2019ve done!\u201d Connor yelled.</p><p>He turned and looked at me and was instantly by my side, wrapping his arms around me and holding me tightly. \u201cAre you okay, baby? I\u2019m so sorry we weren\u2019t here earlier. Did he hurt you?\u201d he asked as he looked me over.</p><p>I stood there, shaking, unable to wrap my head around what had happened as I stared at Connor in a daze. The only words I could muster up were, \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you were in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and pulled me into him, holding my head against his chest as Justin escorted Phil out of the penthouse. Detective James walked over to me and asked if I was okay. I nodded my head as I looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou can relax now, Mrs. Black. He won\u2019t be bothering you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Connor led me over to the couch and continued to hold me. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m so sorry he did this to you,\u201d he kept saying as he kissed my head. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell Justin you left your art studio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to, but he wasn\u2019t there,\u201d I said, still shaking.</p><p>I lifted my head from his chest and looked at him as I began to calm down. \u201cHow did you know I was in my studio?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Connor stared at me and started to speak with apprehension. \u201cThere never was a business trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said in confusion. \u201cI need a drink.\u201d</p><p>Connor got up from the couch and walked over to the bar. He took out a glass and poured some whiskey in it. He couldn\u2019t hand it to me fast enough as I grabbed the glass from his hands and threw it back, letting the soothing burn take over my body.</p><p>\u201cI found out Phil was the one responsible for sending you the messages. That night he came over to have me sign those papers, he was acting strangely, and I could tell by the way he was looking at you and watching you, something wasn\u2019t right. The next morning, I had Paul do some investigating, and he found the phone Phil used to send you the messages. Apparently, he bought it and had it activated in Chicago so it couldn\u2019t be traced here to New York. I called Detective James and showed him the evidence. He said it wasn\u2019t enough to put him away for a long time, and if he physically tried to harm you, he\u2019d go away for many, many years. So, we came up with this plan to get him here alone with you, knowing he\u2019d try something. But it wasn\u2019t supposed to get as far as it did, Ellery, and I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>As I sat there and listened to how Connor and Detective James set this up, tears started pouring from my eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me or warn me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBaby, please, don\u2019t cry,\u201d he said as he sat down and grabbed my hand.</p><p>I pulled away and got up from the couch. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you because if you knew, you would have acted differently, and we couldn\u2019t run the risk of him catching on. It was bad enough he was suspicious of the emergency Chicago trip and that he wasn\u2019t going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were just going to let him rape me?\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Connor got up and started to walk towards me. \u201cNO! I wasn\u2019t. How the hell could you say that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause he damn well got close enough!

I need time away from you because if I don\u2019t get it, I will hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, please!\u201d he yelled as I tore up the stairs.</p><p>I slammed the bedroom door shut and locked it. I took a suitcase from the closet and started throwing some clothes in it. When I was packed, I called a cab and took my suitcase downstairs. Connor was sitting on the couch with his face buried in his hands. When he heard me, he looked up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the beach house, and I\u2019m taking Julia with me. Do not, and I repeat, do not come there. This marriage is hanging by a thread right now and, if you come there, I can promise you that it will be over. I need time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time do you want?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know,\u201d I said as the tears wouldn\u2019t stop flowing and I walked out the door.</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>Connor</p><p>The door shut and, just like that, she was gone. I walked over to the bar to get a drink. I picked up the glass and threw it against the wall. I grabbed the bottle of whiskey and took it upstairs. Whiskey wasn\u2019t my drink of choice, but it was right in front of me. I reached the top of the stairs and stepped inside Julia\u2019s room. As I looked around, tears started falling from my eyes at the thought that I wouldn\u2019t see her for a while. In an instant, my life had unraveled right before my eyes because of my stupidity. I sometimes questioned how the hell I was the CEO of a billion-dollar company. This was not how I planned for things to turn out. Ellery didn\u2019t even know that I called Peyton and told her not to come over. She\u2019d find out soon enough after she called her.</p><p>I lay down on the bed and replayed the night over and over again as I brought the bottle of whiskey to my mouth. I wasn\u2019t going to let Phil hurt Ellery in any way, but Justin slipped up when he let her leave the penthouse. I grabbed my phone and looked at it, hoping she\u2019d left me a message of some sort. But she hadn\u2019t. I wanted to know how much time she wanted and needed because I couldn\u2019t give her time. She was my wife and the mother of my child, and I wanted them back home. As I drank the last drop of whiskey, I threw the bottle across the room and watched it shatter as it hit the dresser. As the effects of the alcohol clouded my thinking, I felt myself slipping backwards to a time I never wanted to remember.</p><p>The nightmare of what happened jolted me awake. I looked over at the time and it was five o\u2019clock in the morning. My head was pounding and my skin was drenched with sweat. I grabbed my phone from the nightstand and prayed Ellery had either called or messaged me. She hadn\u2019t. The ache in my heart was back with a vengeance as it screamed in agony. I rolled over and fell back asleep.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the f**k is going on?!\u201d Peyton\u2019s high-pitched voice startled me from an alcohol-induced sleep.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Peyton, this is my bedroom. Get out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, buddy. Are you hung over? You look like shit!\u201d</p><p>The last thing I needed right now was Peyton. I stumbled out of bed and walked into the bathroom. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I need to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, but I\u2019ll be downstairs making you a pot of coffee, and then we\u2019re going to have a little talk.\u201d</p><p>I stood in the shower and let the hot water beat down on my body. As I put my hands up against the shower wall and closed my eyes, thoughts of Ellery and Julia consumed me. I stepped out, got dressed, and headed downstairs for some much-needed coffee. Peyton had a cup poured and sitting on the table across from her.</p><p>\u201cSit down, now!\u201d Peyton commanded.</p><p>\u201cCan I get some aspirin first?\u201d I asked as I shot her a look. \u201cHave you talked to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I talked to her, and I was with her last night as she was crying her eyes out at Mason\u2019s place. \u201cWhat the f**k were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way to trap him and stop this nightmare. I was afraid that if Ellery knew, she would give something away and he would get suspicious. It just wasn\u2019t a chance I could take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, to end your nightmare, you created another one for Ellery. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>I took two aspirin from the bottle and chased them down with a bottle of water. I sat at the table and glared at Peyton.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not right. To end one nightmare, I created two more. My nightmare and Ellery\u2019s nightmare. And I have no clue how to end it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone, that\u2019s how you can end it. She\u2019ll come to you when she\u2019s had time to think about everything. I know you\u2019ll go crazy, so I\u2019ll text you to let you know how she\u2019s doing, even though you don\u2019t deserve to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peyton. I owe you big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you do. In fact, I believe I\u2019ve done this quite a few times. You owe me, Connor Black.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>Peyton got up from the chair, walked over to me, and kissed my head. \u201cYou seriously need to sit and think about how you\u2019re never going to keep anything from Ellery again. Because next time, you may not be so lucky, and she\u2019ll leave your dumb ass for good.\u201d</p><p>As I sat in the chair and finished my coffee, I stared out the window. The clouds were starting to roll in and a storm looked like it was brewing, much like the storm that blew through my life last night. I needed to get to the office and keep my mind off of Ellery, but I missed her and Julia so much. I picked up my phone and sent Ellery a text message.</p><p>\u201cI know you said not to contact you, but Julia is my daughter too, and I want to see her. It\u2019s not fair that you took her away and won\u2019t let me see her.\u201d</p><p>About twenty minutes later, she replied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll send Julia to the penthouse with Mason tomorrow and then you are to send her back the next day.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond because I would\u2019ve told her that our child wasn\u2019t a ping-pong ball, and she didn\u2019t deserve to be bounced around like that. At least she was letting me see Julia and that was more than I thought she\u2019d do. I would give her the space she wanted, even if it ended up killing me.</p><p>The days were long and the nights were longer. I hadn\u2019t spoken to Ellery in over a week, and every day, another piece of my soul died. Mason dropped off Julia a couple of times, and Peyton had been keeping me informed about Ellery. I had to keep the rumors at bay about Phil and tell everyone that he decided to leave Black Enterprises for personal reasons. I paid Detective James a great deal of money to keep all this quiet, and I made a huge donation to the New York City Police Department. After working all day and into the evening, I would go home and drink myself to sleep. Peyton told me that Ellery was okay, but that she was sad all the time. It killed me to hear that because I was the cause of her sadness and pain, and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever forgive myself for what I\u2019d done to her.</p><p>I finished up everything that needed to be done at the office, so I got in the Range Rover and started driving. While I was stopped at a light, I looked to my right and saw a place that I hadn\u2019t thought about in a very long time, Club S. I didn\u2019t want to go home, so I decided to stop in there and have a drink. The club was hopping, the music was loud, and there were wall-to-wall people. I walked back by the bar and saw there was an open table. I sat down and was immediately greeted by a waitress.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGive me a scotch, make it a double, and bring me three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, sweetie.\u201d She smiled as she walked away.</p><p>While I sat in my seat, I looked around at the area that I had frequently visited before I met Ellery. The waitress came back and set the three glasses down in front of me. I drank them and wanted more, so I signaled for her to get me three more. As I was downing the fifth glass of scotch, I heard a familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well, if it isn\u2019t Connor Black.\u201d</p><p>I looked over to the side as she sat down next to me. \u201cHello, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here? Where\u2019s Ellery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left me and took Julia with her,\u201d I said as I leaned back.</p><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s crazy. What did you do to make her leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks I put her life in danger because I didn\u2019t tell her something. Fuck, maybe I did. I don\u2019t know anymore,\u201d I said as I threw back my last glass of scotch. \u201cI thought I was doing the right thing. Maybe I was or I wasn\u2019t. The only thing that mattered was Ellery thought otherwise and she left me for it.\u201d</p><p>Sarah put her hand on top of mine, and I looked at her. \u201cWe had some good times, you and I. There was even a moment once when I thought maybe we could become something, even though it would be breaking your rules. Then Ellery walked into your life, and you instantly changed. I\u2019d never seen anyone change as fast as you did. All those years, you were never the person you were meant to be until you met her. You\u2019re a good man, Connor, and this is only temporary. I don\u2019t know Ellery that well, but from what I do know, and from what I\u2019ve seen, she\u2019s a forgiving person and she\u2019ll come around. Just give her some time,\u201d she said as she got up and hugged me. \u201cI\u2019m with someone here, so I need to go and find them.\u201d</p><p>I hoped Sarah was right and that Ellery would be back soon, but until then, I drank my sadness away. I lifted my hand as I saw my waitress walk by. \u201cBring me three more doubles,\u201d I yelled over the loud music.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>Ellery</p><p>The house felt empty without Connor. I heard Julia cry, so I walked upstairs to get her from her crib. It had been over a week since I\u2019d seen or talked to Connor. Every second and every minute of each day was killing me slowly. As I took Julia from her crib, she looked at me and smiled. I bundled her up in her jacket and took her down by the water just as the sun was getting ready to set.</p><p>\u201cListen carefully, Julia, and you\u2019ll be able to hear the whispers of the ocean.\u201d</p><p>The soothing sound of the waves lapping against the shoreline made me think of the special times I was with Connor at the beach. My mind traveled back to when Connor proposed to me in California. When I first told him about my past after the autism charity, and when I ran to the beach in the middle of the night before I got the final results of my last treatment. But the most special memory was when Connor asked me to marry him. The ocean held so many memories for me, not only with Connor, but with my mom. The sun was starting to set and, as I pointed to it, I told Julia to look up.</p><p>\u201cThe sun setting over the ocean will be one of the most beautiful things you\u2019ll ever see. Your daddy proposed to me on the beach, just as the sun was setting. He made sure everything was perfect.\u201d I smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julia screeched and then looked at me and put her hand on my face. She knew I was sad, and I could tell how much she missed Connor. I sat down with her and let her run her hands through the sand. The beach, the ocean, and the sunset, would become as special to her as it was to me.</p><p>\u201cHe misses you, and he\u2019s not doing good,\u201d I heard a voice say behind me.</p><p>I turned around and saw Denny standing a few feet away from us. I smiled and held out my hand for him to sit next to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? Should you even be here?\u201d I asked as I kissed him on the cheek.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Dana drove. She\u2019s in the house, talking to Mason. I don\u2019t want to talk about me. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said as I looked out into the ocean water.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. I know you, Ellery, and you miss him just as much as he misses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so mad at him, Denny. How could he do that to me? How many times do I have to tell him not to keep things from me before it sinks into that thick head of his?\u201d</p><p>Denny smiled at me and then looked at Julia. \u201cSometimes, we don\u2019t always make the right decisions under pressure and stress. Need I remind you of a few times you didn\u2019t make the right decisions where Connor was concerned?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed and shook my head. \u201cThat was different and we weren\u2019t married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not have been married, but you were a couple and you loved him. Listen to me, Connor is Connor, and he always will be. It\u2019s how he\u2019s wired. His love for you is so powerful that it clouds his judgment sometimes. The only thing he saw when he made the decision not to tell you about Phil was keeping you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always defending him,\u201d I said as I looked over at him.</p><p>\u201cNot always. I had a talk with him too. Believe me, I yelled at him and pretty much called him every name in the book. I think he got my point. The two of you can\u2019t even be apart for one night, let alone an entire week. Everyone makes mistakes, Ellery.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him with knitted eyebrows. \u201cOkay, some more than others.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShould I remind you about how you lied to Connor and went and saw Ashlyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust another thing he didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d I said as I rolled my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAnd for a good reason. You could have gotten yourself killed. You know that girl is crazy,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was getting chilly and the winds were starting to pick up. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201d I smiled as I picked Julia up and looped my arm around Denny\u2019s.</p><p>As soon as we walked inside, Dana came over and took Julia from me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t the two of you stay here tonight and then we can all head back in the morning?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going back home?\u201d Denny asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think it\u2019s about time, and Connor and I need to sit down and have a serious talk.\u201d</p><p>After I put Julia to bed, the four of us sat around the table and talked. It was eleven o\u2019clock p.m. and my phone started to ring. I looked over and saw it was Connor calling. I wasn\u2019t ready to talk to him yet, so I rejected it. A minute later, my phone rang, and it was him again.</p><p>\u201cConnor, what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Ellery, this is Sarah.\u201d</p> <p>I froze as I held the phone up to my ear and my heart started racing with the thought that he was with her.</p><p>\u201cI know what you must be thinking right now, and this isn\u2019t what it seems. I took Connor\u2019s phone to call you because he\u2019s here at Club S, a drunken mess, and you need to come get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is he doing there?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming he came in to drink his troubles away. Listen, I\u2019ll wait with him until you get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sarah. I\u2019m on my way,\u201d I said as I hung up the phone.</p><p>Denny looked at me as I got up from my seat. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor is drunk at Club S, and Sarah told me that I need to come get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go and bring his sorry ass home?\u201d Denny said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll go.\u201d I picked up the phone and called a cab. \u201cMason, can you pack up all of Julia\u2019s things and bring her home tomorrow? I don\u2019t want to wake her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will,\u201d he said as he walked over to me. \u201cGo get your man and spend some time alone. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>As I got out of the cab, I stood in front of Club S as the line of people waited impatiently to get into the now famous club. I walked up to the front and stood behind the rope as I called Frankie\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cEllery Black! How are you, girl?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Frankie. It\u2019s nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor\u2019s inside and someone called me to come get him.\u201d</p><p>Frankie lifted the rope. \u201cGo on in, Elle. It was good to see you. If you need my help, come get me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Frankie. It was good to see you too.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>The music was loud and people were everywhere. As I pushed my way through the crowd, I headed towards the bar. While I stood there looking around, I felt someone tap me on the shoulder. I turned around and saw Sarah standing there.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s over there,\u201d Sarah said as she pointed to a table in the corner.</p><p>Instantly, I started to have flashbacks of the night when I first saw him. I took in a deep breath and started walking towards him. Sarah grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on him. He\u2019s full of regret, and he\u2019s sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he told you what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of it, but I know he messed up. I\u2019ve never seen love like I do when I see the two of you. It\u2019s romantic, and I\u2019m envious of what the two of you have. I didn\u2019t think a love like that existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for keeping an eye on him. I appreciate it.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Ellery,\u201d she said as she walked away.</p><p>I stood there and stared at him from across the way. He could barely sit up. After being apart for a week, this wasn\u2019t the way I wanted to see him. As I took in another breath, I walked over to him, sat down, and took the glass out of his hand.</p><p>\u201cEllery,\u201d he slurred.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Connor. It\u2019s time to go home,\u201d I said as I helped him up.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming too,\u201d he slurred.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m coming home. Now let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around me as I held him up and helped him to the door. He could barely walk and he was stumbling so badly that he almost took me down. We reached the doors and stepped outside. The cab was parked at the curb. I opened the cab door and tried to help him in.</p><p>\u201cGet in the cab, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk first. I don\u2019t want to get in the cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the cab, Connor,\u201d I said a second time as I pushed him in.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t slide over, so I shut the door, got in the other side, and gave the cab driver our address. Connor looked over at me. All I could see was the sadness in his eyes. I was really pissed off that he went to the club, but that was an issue we\u2019d deal with later.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he said as he ran his hand down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so drunk,\u201d I replied.</p><p>He leaned his head on my shoulder, but he kept falling forward. I brought his head down to my lap and softly stroked his hair as he closed his eyes. Shortly after, we arrived in the garage of the penthouse.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help getting him out, ma\u2019am?\u201d the cab driver asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I can manage,\u201d I replied as I handed him a large tip.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, ma\u2019am!\u201d he said with excitement.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your patience.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I sat Connor up and told him to stay there while I walked around to the other side. I opened the door, grabbed his arm and helped him out. He stumbled and it took every bit of strength I had to hold him up and not fall.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a familiar scene?\u201d I said to him as I walked him to the elevator.</p><p>I leaned him up against the wall while we waited for the doors to open. His eyes never left mine.</p><p>\u201cI want to f**k you so bad,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, baby,\u201d I said as the elevator doors opened and I helped him inside.</p><p>When we arrived to the penthouse, I helped him off the elevator and tried to get him up the stairs. He kept tripping over the steps and falling.</p><p>\u201cConnor, you have to help me out here.\u201d</p><p>I helped him climb up the stairs on his hands since he was way too drunk to walk up them. As soon as he made it to the top step, I stood him up and helped him to our bedroom. \u201cAre you going to be sick?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said as he nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cHurry and get to the bathroom!\u201d I exclaimed as I pushed him.</p><p>He made it to the bathroom just in time, and he started vomiting in the toilet. I left him there, went into the bedroom, and turned down the bed. When I went back into the bathroom, he was lying on the floor. I shook my head and sighed as I ran a washcloth under warm water and put it on his head.</p><p>\u201cCome on; you need to get in bed,\u201d I said as I sat him up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything, Ellery. I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you left me and never wanted to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you, Connor. Please give me some help here, so you can go to bed. You need to sleep the alcohol off.\u201d</p><p>As he was sitting up on the bathroom floor, I lifted his shirt off and helped him up. With my help, he made it to the bed and fell back on it. As I unbuttoned his pants and started to pull them down, he grabbed my hands.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he slurred.</p><p>\u201cI know you do, and I love you too. Now, lift your ass up and help me get your pants off.\u201d</p><p>Once I had him stripped down to his boxers, I told him to turn around and lie down on his pillow.</p><p>\u201cNow, remember to lie on your side,\u201d I said as I covered him with the sheet and wiped his forehead with the cloth one last time before he closed his eyes.</p><p>As I sighed, I got up from the bed and changed into my pajamas. I washed my face, put my hair in a ponytail, and lay down next to him, watching to make sure he stayed on his side.</p><p>I opened my eyes and looked at the clock. It was nine o\u2019clock a.m. already, and I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d slept that late. I rolled over and Connor was still sound asleep. I got out of bed, washed my face, brushed my teeth, and headed to the kitchen to start a pot of coffee. As much as Connor hated my hangover cocktail, he was going to need it desperately when he woke up. I gathered the ingredients and put them in the blender. I was pouring myself a cup of coffee when I heard someone clear his throat from behind me. I slowly turned around and stared at Connor as he leaned up against the wall with his arms folded.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I go over the rules with you last night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile as I bit down on my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby,\u201d he said as he held out his arms.</p><p>I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around him as tightly as I could. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Please tell me you forgive me,\u201d he begged as he buried his face deep into my neck.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you, but we need to talk,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019ll do anything to make things right. I love you, and I missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>I broke our embrace and placed my hands on his face. \u201cI missed you too,\u201d I said as I kissed him. \u201cCome sit down and have some coffee and the hangover cocktail I just made.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know I hate that stuff, Elle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, but it works and you have to be feeling pretty lousy right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said as he rubbed his head.</p><p>I picked up the glass with the cocktail in it and sat down on his lap. He wrapped his arms around me as I brought the glass to his lips. \u201cDrink.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>He looked at me, made a face, and took a sip as I tilted the glass. He took it from my hand and chugged it down as fast as he could, then placed the glass on the counter.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Julia?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at the house with Mason. He\u2019s going to pack her stuff up and bring her home later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go sit on the couch,\u201d he said.</p><p>We sat on the couch, and I snuggled up against him as he put his arm around me. \u201cDo you remember anything about last night?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really. How did you know I was at the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah used your phone to call me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said as he looked away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Connor. She kept an eye on you until I got there. She\u2019s a good person. I\u2019ve misjudged her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a good person, but don\u2019t be going and becoming best friends with her.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I stroked his chest. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>When I lifted my head and stared up at him, he brought his mouth down to mine. His kiss was soft and gentle. I\u2019ve missed his mouth, his kisses, everything, and my body was begging for him. I sat up and straddled him. His small smile grew bigger as he stroked my hair. I brought my lips to his and kissed him with such passion that it made my toes curl. After we made love the second time, Connor called Mason and told him not to bring Julia home because we were coming out to the beach house to stay for a while.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying at the house? For how long?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We can stay for as long as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Black Enterprises? You don\u2019t have a VP to help out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy dad is going to come out of retirement while I take some time off to spend with my wife and daughter.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>I smiled back as I kissed him. I wanted nothing more than to have him all to myself for a while. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Connor\u2019s hand swept across my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re the light in my life and when you\u2019re not around, my world is dark. I will never do anything to jeopardize our relationship again. I make this promise to you, Ellery Black, that from this day forward, I will never keep anything from you. You have my word, baby. I promise forever.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>Connor</p><p>It was Julia\u2019s first birthday and party today. We\u2019d spent the last two months at the house. I worked from home and occasionally went into the office. My dad had done an excellent job taking over as vice president, but did warn me to find someone quickly because he needed to go back into retirement. Caterers had been in and out of the house all day, preparing for Julia\u2019s party. She had just started walking and took her first steps to me. Her first word was \u201cdada\u201d and Ellery was not happy with that.</p><p>As I looked around the house at all the balloons that were hanging everywhere, I walked up to Julia\u2019s room, where Ellery was getting her ready for the party. The minute she saw me, she said, \u201cDada\u201d and smiled. As soon as Ellery put her princess dress on her, Julia walked over to me and hugged my legs.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep an eye on her while I go and get ready?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I can,\u201d I said as I picked up Julia.</p><p>I took her out of the room and went downstairs. She smiled and pointed when she saw the balloons.</p><p>\u201cThose are for you,\u201d I said as I kissed her cheek.</p><p>She looked at me and then screamed to hold one. I took one out of the bunch and gave it to her. She smiled as her hand wrapped around the ribbon that was tied to the balloon. She babbled on as she put her hand in her mouth and looked up at the balloon she was holding. I love my little girl so much. Ellery was my queen and Julia was my princess, and nothing would ever change that.</p><p>Guests had started to arrive and the party was underway. We had a total of one hundred people show up to help celebrate Julia\u2019s first birthday. It was a day of fun, laughter, and good times with friends and family. Ellery even went to the extreme and invited Sarah. She came with her boyfriend, and they both seemed really happy. Cassidy and Ben were still dating and he confided in me that he was going to ask Cassidy to marry him. Denny had some aggressive chemo treatments for a month and was in remission and doing well.</p><p>Julia was exhausted by time the party ended and she was getting cranky. After the last of the guests left, Ellery and I took Julia upstairs and put her in the bathtub. When her bath was finished, Ellery put Julia in her pajamas, we both kissed her cheeks, and then Ellery laid her down in her crib. I held out my hand to Ellery and she took it as we walked out of Julia\u2019s room, shutting the door behind us. We both stood outside the door for a moment to make sure she didn\u2019t scream. The caterers and cleanup crew were cleaning the house, so I took Ellery outside and down to the beach.</p><p>\u201cThat was a great party.\u201d I said as we sat down in the sand.</p><p>\u201cThanks, honey. It was, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I brought her hand to my lips and kissed it as we looked ahead at the ocean water. \u201cNow that we\u2019re alone, there\u2019s something I need to tell you,\u201d Ellery said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, sweetheart?\u201d I asked as I looked at her.</p><p>She turned to face me and took my hands in hers. With a big smile, she placed my hands on her stomach. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have another baby!\u201d</p><p>I sat and looked at her shock. \u201cWhat? Are you sure? When did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out this morning. I wanted to tell you right away, but with all the people in and out, getting the house ready for the party, and then the guests arriving, I figured it would be better to wait until we were alone.\u201d</p><p>The joy that shot through me was incredible. I was so happy that Ellery was pregnant again and I wanted to shout it from the rooftops. I cupped her face in my hands and I kissed her lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so incredibly happy. Tell me you\u2019re happy, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy. Maybe this one will be a boy.\u201d She smiled as she rubbed her tummy.</p><p>\u201cIt is a boy. Aunt Sadie said so, remember?\u201d</p><p>We laughed and hugged each other tight. I got up and held out my hand. Ellery placed her hand in mine as I took her into the house and straight up to our bedroom to celebrate the news.</p><p>The next eight months passed by so quickly. It seemed like it was only yesterday that Ellery told me she was pregnant. She was scheduled for a C-Section tomorrow morning. We found out through the ultrasound that we were having a baby boy. I was elated at the news that we would have a boy to carry on the Black name and hopefully, someday, take over Black Enterprises. Julia was growing fast and becoming, what Mason liked to call her, a diva. But she was still my little princess and she had me wrapped around her little finger.</p><p>After I put Julia to bed, I walked into our bedroom, where Ellery was sitting sketching on her sketchpad. The Chicago building was finally up and running and the Art Gallery was doing very well. I took off my shirt and pants, put on my pajama bottoms, grabbed my laptop, and sat on the bed next to Ellery. I leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. She turned to me and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what, baby?\u201d I asked as I opened up my laptop.</p><p>\u201cI know we talked about a couple of boys\u2019 names, but I\u2019ve already decided on one for this child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? You decided on a name without consulting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Does that really surprise you?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t. What did you come up with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to name our son Collin, after your twin brother.\u201d</p><p>As I put my hand on her large belly, I smiled at her. \u201cI would love to call my son Collin. Thank you, sweetheart,\u201d I said as I kissed her.</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re on board with it. I really wasn\u2019t sure how\u2019d you feel about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollin would be honored to have his nephew named after him.\u201d</p><p>Ellery smiled and went back to her sketch pad. I answered some emails and read some articles.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, how\u2019s Ben doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBen\u2019s doing good. He\u2019s settled in his office, and he\u2019s buried up to his neck in legal bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great that you hired him, and I know Cassidy is happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great lawyer. He\u2019s marrying my sister, and he\u2019ll be at all the family functions. How could I not hire him?\u201d I winked.</p><p>\u201cJust think, this time tomorrow, we\u2019ll have our second child. I never thought I\u2019d have one child, let alone two,\u201d Ellery said.</p><p>\u201cMe neither, baby. I never saw kids in my future, until I met you.\u201d I smiled as I looked over at her. She looked so tired. I pushed her hair behind her ear and ran the back of my hand across her cheek. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put your sketch pad away and get some sleep. You look tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am tired. It\u2019s been a long day,\u201d she said as she closed her sketch pad and set it on the nightstand. She leaned over and gave me a kiss on the lips. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t even been five minutes and Ellery was sound asleep. I was thirsty, so I got out of bed and headed downstairs for a bottle of water. On my way back up, I stopped into the spare bedroom that we had turned into a nursery. I flipped the light switch and looked around. The painted ocean blue walls with colorful fish, coral, and seaweed made you feel like you were standing in the bottom of the ocean. The turtles Ellery had painted on the wall were amazing, as were the stars up above on the ceiling. She spent three months painting the room and she just finished putting the final touches on it yesterday. I smiled at the thought that come tomorrow, I\u2019d have a son, and we\u2019d finally be a family of four.</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>Ellery</p><p>Six years later...</p><p>We took the kids out to dinner before heading over to FAO Schwarz. Christmas was in three weeks and the kids were excited to see Santa Claus. We sat in the restaurant, waiting for our food. Julia was sitting next to Connor, and Collin was sitting next to me. Both kids were coloring a picture. Julia kept looking at the group of women who were at the next table. They kept looking over at Connor. I noticed her looking at them, but I didn\u2019t say anything. The waitress walked over and set our food down in front of us.</p><p>\u201cJulia, eat your chicken fingers,\u201d Connor said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will, Daddy, don\u2019t worry,\u201d she responded as she kept looking at the table next to us.</p><p>I knew those women were staring at my husband and, after all these years, I still had a problem with it. But I\u2019d toned it down, and I didn\u2019t embarrass Connor as much. Out of the clear blue, Julia looked at Connor.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, those women keep staring at you and that\u2019s rude.\u201d</p><p>I almost choked on my salad as I started to laugh. Connor looked at me with wide eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI know, Julia. Don\u2019t worry about it. Just finish your dinner,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMommy, why do they keep staring over here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey keep staring because they think your daddy is very handsome. Now, finish your dinner so we can go see Santa Claus.\u201d</p><p>Julia smiled as she ate her chicken. Collin was being a good boy and eating his dinner because he was excited to go to the toy store. As we finished eating, the waitress brought our bill and Connor paid. When we got out of the booth, I took Collin\u2019s hand and Connor grabbed Julia\u2019s. As we were leaving, I instantly froze when I heard Julia speak.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t anyone ever told you that staring is rude?\u201d Julia said to the women at the table next to us.</p> <p>I heard Connor apologizing to them as I smiled and kept walking. When we stepped outside the restaurant, Connor stopped and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what your daughter said back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t funny, Ellery. She embarrassed me. Now I have to worry about her too?\u201d</p><p>I kissed Connor on the lips. \u201cYeah, I guess you do,\u201d I said as I patted his chest.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything to her?\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>When we were walking down the street to FAO Schwarz, Connor stopped and bent down so he was eye level with Julia. \u201cJulia, what you did back at the restaurant embarrassed Daddy, and I don\u2019t want you to do that ever again. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Daddy? Mommy and Aunt Peyton say things to people all the time if they are doing something rude.\u201d</p><p>Connor shot me a look and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He stood up, took her hand, and growled at me. \u201cGreat, she\u2019s just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, you love it. She\u2019s protecting her daddy.\u201d I smiled as I hooked my arm around his.</p><p>We entered through the doors of FAO Schwarz and the kids were in Heaven. The first thing we did was get in line to see Santa. The line wasn\u2019t too long, and all the Christmas decorations and animated people keep the kids occupied. Connor put his arm around me and kissed my head. I smiled as I rested my head on his shoulder. Julia and Collin got along great. She was protective of her brother and stuck up for him, even with us. It was finally our turn and both kids went and sat on Santa\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want for Christmas?\u201d he asked Collin.</p><p>\u201cI want a bike and a train set,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what about you, pretty girl?\u201d Santa asked Julia.</p><p>\u201cI want an easel and paints, so I can paint beautiful pictures like my mommy. Oh, and I want new Barbies and a baby doll, but it has to be the one that goes potty and comes with diapers and a bottle and really cute clothes. I want jewelry so I can sparkle like a princess. I want this really cool four-story dollhouse with all the furniture and the family of four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, oh my, you sure want a lot of things,\u201d Santa said.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, Santa. It\u2019s Christmas, and my daddy said I can have anything I want. So I want all that.\u201d Julia smiled as she got off his lap. She started walking way, stopped, and turned around. \u201cOh Santa, I also want an iPad. The 128GB in white with a Hello Kitty case.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>I looked at Connor. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd you blame me,\u201d I said.</p><p>He laughed as we walked over and took the kids\u2019 hands.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty long list of things, Julia,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cNot really, Daddy. There\u2019s more. I\u2019ll give you my complete Christmas list when we get home. I\u2019ve been adding to it for months.\u201d</p><p>Connor shook his head and looked at me. I guess I was going to have to have a little talk with Julia on what Christmas was really about. When we reached the big piano, Collin and Julia ran to it as fast as they could. The piano was their favorite part of the store. Connor and I stood back and watched as our two beautiful children played on it.</p><p>\u201cStanding here, like this, I feel like I\u2019m watching me and Cassidy,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how fast time flies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought it,\u201d Connor said as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cBought what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe big piano. I bought it for them for Christmas. That way we could all play on it, together as a family.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>I stood there and shook my head. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI bought one too.\u201d</p><p>Connor pulled me into him and kissed my head. \u201cGreat minds think alike, baby. That\u2019s okay; we\u2019ll keep one at the penthouse and one at the beach house.\u201d</p><p>Christmas had come and gone and, before we knew it, summer had arrived and the kids were out of school. We spent most of our time at the beach house. I was sitting down at the beach with my arms wrapped around my legs, when Julia came up to me.</p><p>\u201cMommy, Daddy\u2019s being mean and won\u2019t let me have any ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be eating dinner soon. So I agree with your daddy. No ice cream until after dinner.\u201d I smiled as I tapped her on the nose.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you just sitting here like this? Are you sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about my mom and how we would spend time at the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Julia. She died when I was a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mommy,\u201d she said as she put her little arm around me. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d a voice said from behind me.</p><p>Julia got up and looked at Connor as she put her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you right now,\u201d she said as she stomped away.</p><p>I laughed and Connor sighed as he sat down next to me. \u201cPlease tell me it gets better,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSorry to break the news to you, but it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said as he put his arm around me.</p><p>Before long, Collin and Julia ran to where Connor and I were sitting. Julia ran up to Connor, threw sand at his back, and then ran away.</p><p>\u201cJulia Rose Black, get back here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Daddy, but if you want me there, you\u2019ll have to catch me.\u201d She giggled.</p><p>Connor looked at me with a huge smile as he ran after Julia. Collin sat down next me and opened his hand.</p><p>\u201cLook what I found.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Inside his hand, he held a beautiful pink rock. \u201cIt\u2019s for you, Mommy, because it\u2019s pretty like you.\u201d</p><p>I took it from his hand and wrapped my arms around him. \u201cYou\u2019re my sweet boy, and I love you, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Connor caught Julia and carried her upside down back to where we were sitting. Julia was laughing while begging him to put her down. Connor set her down and kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cLook, the sun is about to set,\u201d I said as I pointed out into the ocean water.</p><p>As I held Collin in my lap, Connor pulled Julia onto his and he put his arm around me as we sat there and watched the sunset over the ocean water as a family.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d I said as I walked through the door.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad.\u201d Julia smiled as she turned around and looked at me.</p><p>I took in a deep breath as I shook my head. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, Julia. You look just like your mother did on our wedding day. Where did the years go? My little princess is all grown up and getting married,\u201d I said as my eyes started to swell with tears.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t. You\u2019re going to make my mascara run and then Uncle Mason will kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, and we can\u2019t have that.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m getting married. The last year of planning went by so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife goes by so fast. Just twenty-three short years ago, I was holding you in my arms for the first time. Now, before you know it, you\u2019ll be making me a grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a while, Dad.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>I took in a deep breath and took her hands in mine. \u201cI guess now is as good a time as any to have a little talk with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, if you\u2019re going to make me cry, please let\u2019s save it until after the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my little girl and you always will be. No matter how old you are, you\u2019ll always be my angel. Today, I\u2019ll be giving you away to your husband and as much as I like Jake, it\u2019s still hard. Your mother brought light into my dark world and, the day you were born, you made it brighter. I want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Julia said as she put one hand on my chest. \u201cYou have been the best dad any girl could ask for. You gave me everything I needed to be comfortable, you loved me even when I didn\u2019t deserve it, and you taught me about life. You and Mom gave me the best childhood I could ever ask for, and you showed me what love was. The love that the two of you share and give is amazing and, thanks to you, I found that love with Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did, and I know how much he loves you. I can see it when he looks at you, and I\u2019m proud to call him my son-in law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me you told him that.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, after you took him out to dinner the other night to have your little talk.\u201d</p><p>As I smiled at my little girl, the door opened, and Ellery walked in.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me your dad isn\u2019t making you cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, we\u2019re just having a little father-daughter talk,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhich results in tears,\u201d Ellery said as she looked at Julia.</p><p>Julia laughed and turned around and looked in the mirror. Collin walked in and told me he needed help with his tuxedo. As I started to walk out the door, Julia called my name.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dad.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby.\u201d I smiled back as I walked out of the room.</p><p>After I helped Collin with the cufflinks on his tuxedo, I walked into the bedroom and sat down on the bed. A few moments later, Ellery walked in.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Connor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said as I got up and fixed my bowtie in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really having a hard time with Julia getting married, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little bit, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not happy for her, because I am. I love Jake like a son and I know he\u2019ll take good care of her, but it\u2019s hard to let her go. It seems like it was only yesterday that she was sitting on the floor, playing with her toys.\u201d</p><p>Ellery wrapped her arms around me and held me tight. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, sweetheart. But you act like you\u2019ll never see her again. You bought two apartments one floor down, and had them converted into one big apartment, and she works at Black Enterprises. You\u2019ll see her every day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was right. I would see her every day. I broke our embrace and looked at my beautiful wife. \u201cHave I told you today how absolutely gorgeous you look?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou have, but I won\u2019t complain if you want to tell me again.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on her h*ps and leaned in closer as my lips brushed against her exposed neck. \u201cYou\u2019re stunning and elegant, and I want to do very bad things with you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Ellery gasped as she tilted her head and allowed me better access. \u201cAs much as I want you to do bad things to me, we have to leave now; the limos are waiting for us.\u201d I looked at my watch and saw that she was right. It was time to get our little bride to her groom.</p> <p>The wedding was taking place in the Conservatory Gardens in Central Park; the exact same spot where Ellery and I got married. No expense was spared for this wedding. It had become the event of the year. We couldn\u2019t have asked for a more perfect day. There wasn\u2019t a cloud in the sky and the sun was shining brightly. As we pulled up to the Vanderbilt Gates, Ellery kissed me on the cheek and told me she\u2019d see me in a while. I looked out the window at the guests that were already seated and waiting for the ceremony to start.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, sweetheart?\u201d I asked Julia as she sat across from me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dad, I\u2019m as ready as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>The driver opened the door. I stepped out of the limo and held out my hand, helping Julia from her seat. I led her to the entrance of the gates, and we stood on the edge of the white runner.</p><p>\u201cYou better not cry,\u201d Julia said as she looked at me.</p> <p>\u201cYou better not cry.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s going to cry, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she will. She was trying to be strong earlier, but when she sees you walking down the aisle, she\u2019ll break down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI caught her crying this morning, but she doesn\u2019t know that I saw her, so please don\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>The band started to play the \u201cWedding March\u201d and that was our cue to start walking down the aisle. \u201cHere we go. Are you sure you want to go through with this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, stop it. Of course I want to.\u201d</p> <p>With Julia\u2019s arm wrapped around mine, I walked my baby girl down the aisle. Jake was grinning from ear to ear. As I looked over at Ellery, I saw a tear fall from her eye. When we reached the end of the aisle, I placed Julia\u2019s hand in Jake\u2019s, kissed her on the cheek, and then wiped the single tear that fell from her eye. I took my seat next to Ellery and held her hand. She was trying so hard to hold back the rest of the tears that wanted to fall. I leaned in closer to her and whispered, \u201cRemember your makeup. We have pictures to take after the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head as we sat there and watched our daughter get married.</p><p>The reception was held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel; the same place where Ellery and I had our reception. We arrived before Julia, Jake, and the wedding party did. Peyton and Henry walked in a few moments after us.</p><p>\u201cElle, the ceremony was amazing!\u201d Peyton said.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it? Just think, in a couple of years, we could be doing this again with Collin and Hailey.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Henry and put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cGood, then it\u2019ll be your turn to pay for a wedding like this.\u201d</p><p>Henry laughed before walking over to the bar to get a drink. I walked over to the table where Denny and Dana were sitting. Both of them were having some health issues, but they wouldn\u2019t miss Julia\u2019s wedding for anything. Ellery was talking to Cassidy when I walked over and told her that Julia and Jake had arrived. The band introduced the newly married couple and then each person in the bridal party.</p><p>After an exceptional dinner, it was time for the bridal dance. Jake took Julia\u2019s hand and led her to the dance floor. You could see how much he loved her and adored her. He reminded me of myself. We had been down a bit of a rough road with Julia and a couple of her boyfriends, and Ellery and I were so thankful when she\u2019d met Jake. Ellery stood in front of me, and I wrapped my arms around her as we watched our daughter and son in-law share their first dance as husband and wife.</p> <p>\u201cRemember our bridal dance?\u201d Ellery asked.</p><p>\u201cI sure do. How could I forget? I picked our perfect song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and it was perfect. Julia and Jake remind me of us.\u201d</p><p>Their song had ended, and the song for the bridal party came on. As soon as they introduced Collin and Hailey, everyone cheered.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll get married?\u201d I asked Ellery.</p><p>\u201cYes. I know he loves her very much, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he buys her a ring for her birthday in a few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor kids. They don\u2019t stand a chance with you and Peyton involved.\u201d</p><p>Ellery laughed and reached behind me and smacked my ass. \u201cYou better watch it, baby. You\u2019re getting me hard,\u201d I said.</p><p>The band had called my name and asked me to step out onto the dance floor, as it was time for our father-daughter dance. I smiled as I walked to Julia and took her hand. The song had started and I began to get a little emotional.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Mrs. Jensen?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great, Dad. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve told you this a thousand times, but thank you again for the honeymoon.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, honey. Did I mention that your mom and I are going too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Julia giggled.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy yourself, but prepare to work extra hard at the office when you get back.\u201d I winked.</p><p>\u201cYour dance with Mom is next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her I picked out the song, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want her to be surprised. It\u2019s such a beautiful song, Dad. You\u2019re such a romantic.\u201d</p><p>Our song had ended, and I hugged Julia before taking the hand of my beautiful wife as she stepped out onto the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cI would like to introduce to you, the bride\u2019s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Connor Black, dancing to \u2018Close Your Eyes,\u2019 handpicked by Mr. Black and dedicated to Mrs. Black,\u201d the singer of the band said.</p><p>Ellery placed her hand in mine and tears started to form in her eyes as she heard the song that was being sung for her.</p><p>\u201cI want you to listen to every word, because this song is exactly how I feel about you. You\u2019re the love of my life, the light of my world, and my savior. You\u2019ll be those things to me forever,\u201d I said as I kissed her lips. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. You\u2019ll ruin your mascara, and we have one more picture to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Connor. Even after all these years, you still make my heart race, and you make me incredibly wet.\u201d Ellery smiled as she whispered in my ear.</p><p>When she said that, I couldn\u2019t help but let out a soft moan. \u201cYou wait until I get you up to the room later, Mrs. Black. Be prepared to be up all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it, Mr. Black.\u201d She grinned from ear to ear.</p><p>Our dance had ended, and the night went on perfectly. It was time for Julia and Jake to leave because my plane was waiting to take them to Europe for their honeymoon. As we stood outside the Waldorf Astoria, Ellery, Julia, Collin, and me stood together for one last picture before Julia and Jake climbed into the limo and waved goodbye.</p><p>The next day, Ellery and I drove to the beach house. I stood at the edge of the shoreline, looking out at the beautiful ocean water and reflected on my life. I\u2019d been nothing but a broken man, and Ellery was nothing but a girl with an illness. Love found and saved both of us and we raised a beautiful family because of it. As I was in deep thought, Ellery walked up and put her arm around me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about our life together and how proud I am of us and our children.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she placed her hand on my chest. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot over the years, but we made it, and we\u2019ll continue to make it. Do you know why?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because infinity is forever, and that\u2019s what you are to me. You\u2019re my infinity, Mr. Black.\u201d</p><p>I turned to her and smiled as I traced her lips with my finger before brushing mine against them. \u201cForever us, baby. It\u2019ll always be forever us.\u201d</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
