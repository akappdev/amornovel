Because it was sliding into July in New York and the temperature was heating up, I chose a slim pair of pressed natural-linen slacks and a sleeveless poplin shell in a soft gray that matched my eyes.</p><p>Since I had no hairstyling talent, I pulled my long blond hair back in a simple ponytail, then made up my face.</p><p>When I was presentable, I left the bedroom.</p><p>I heard Gideon's voice the moment I stepped into the hallway.</p><p>A tiny shiver moved through me when I realized he was angry, his voice low and clipped.</p><p>He didn't rile easily.</p><p>unless he was ticked off with me.</p><p>I could get him to raise his voice and curse, even shove his hands through his glorious shoulder-length mane of inky black hair.</p><p>For the most part, though, Gideon was a testament to leashed power.</p><p>There was no need for him to shout when he could get people to quake in their shoes with just a look or a tersely spoken word.</p><p>I found him in his home office.</p> <p>He stood with his back to the door and a Bluetooth receiver in his ear.</p><p>His arms were crossed and he was staring out the windows of his Fifth Avenue penthouse apartment, giving the impression of a very solitary man, an individual who was separate from the world around him, yet entirely capable of ruling it.</p><p>Leaning into the doorjamb, I drank him in.</p><p>I was certain my view of the skyline was more awe-inspiring than his.</p><p>My vantage point included him superimposed over those towering skyscrapers, an equally powerful and impressive presence.</p><p>He'd finished his shower before I managed to crawl out of bed.</p><p>His seriously addictive body was now dressed in two pieces of an expensively tailored three-piece suit - an admitted hot button of mine.</p><p>The rear view of him showcased a perfect ass and a powerful back encased in a vest.On the wall was a massive collage of photos of us as a couple and one very intimate one that he'd taken of me while I was sleeping.</p><p>Most were pictures taken by the paparazzi who followed his every move.</p><p>He was Gideon Cross, of Cross Industries, and at the ridiculous age of twenty-eight, he was one of the top twenty-five richest people in the world.</p><p>I was pretty sure he owned a significant chunk of Manhattan; I was positive he was the hottest man on the planet.</p><p>And he kept photos of me everywhere he worked, as if I could possibly be as fun to look at as he was.</p><p>He turned, pivoting gracefully to catch me with his icy blue gaze.</p><p>Of course he'd known I was there, watching him.</p><p>There was a crackling in the air when we were near each other, a sense of anticipation like the coiled silence before the boom of thunder.</p><p>He'd probably deliberately waited a beat before facing me, giving me the opportunity to check him out because he knew I loved to look at him.</p><p>Dark and Dangerous.</p><p>And all mine.</p><p>God .</p><p>I never got used to the impact of that face.</p><p>Those sculpted cheekbones and dark winged brows, the thickly lashed blue eyes, and those lips .</p><p>perfectly etched to be both sensual and wicked.</p><p>I loved when they smiled with sexual invitation, and I shivered when they thinned into a stern line.</p><p>And when he pressed those lips to my body, I burned for him.</p><p>Jeez, listen to yourself.</p><p>My mouth curved, remembering how annoyed I used to get at pals who waxed poetic about their boyfriends' good looks.</p><p>But here I was, constantly awed by the gorgeousness of the complicated, frustrating, messed-up, sexy-as-sin man I was falling deeper in love with every day.</p><p>As we stared at each other, his scowl didn't lessen, nor did he cease speaking to the poor soul on the receiving end of his call, but his gaze warmed from its chilly irritation to scorching heat.</p><p>I should've become used to the change that came over him when he looked at me, but it still hit me with a force strong enough to rock me on my feet.</p><p>That look conveyed how hard and deep he wanted to fuck me - which he did every chance he got - and it also afforded me a glimpse of his raw, unrelenting force of will.</p><p>A core of strength and command marked everything Gideon did in life.</p><p>\"See you at eight on Saturday,\" he finished, before yanking off the earpiece and tossing it on his desk.</p><p>\"Come here, Eva.\"</p><p>Another shiver slid through me at the way he said my name, with the same authoritative bite he used when he said Come, Eva, while I was beneath him .</p><p>filled with him .</p><p>desperate to climax for him .</p><p>\"No time for that, ace.\"</p><p>I backed into the hallway, because I was weak where he was concerned.</p><p>The soft rasp in his smooth, cultured voice was nearly capable of making me orgasm just listening to it.</p><p>And whenever he touched me, I caved.</p><p>I hurried to the kitchen to make us some coffee.</p><p>He muttered something under his breath and followed me out, his long stride easily gaining on mine.</p><p>I found myself pinned to the hallway wall by six feet, two inches of hard, hot male.</p><p>\"You know what happens when you run, angel.\"</p><p>Gideon nipped my lower lip with his teeth and then soothed the sting with the caress of his tongue.</p><p>\"I catch you.\"</p><p>Inside me, something sighed with happy surrender and my body went lax with pleasure at being pressed so close to his.</p><p>I craved him constantly, so deeply it was a physical ache.</p><p>What I felt was lust, but it was also so much more.</p><p>Something so precious and profound that Gideon's lust for me wasn't the trigger it would've been with another man.</p><p>If anyone else had attempted to subdue me with the weight of his body, I would've freaked out.</p><p>But it had never been an issue with Gideon.</p><p>He knew what I needed and how much I could take.</p><p>The sudden flash of his grin stopped my heart.</p><p>Confronted with that breathtaking face framed by that lustrous dark hair, I felt my knees weaken just a little.</p><p>He was so polished and urbane except for the decadent length of those silky strands.</p><p>He nuzzled his nose against mine.</p><p>\"You can't smile at me like that, then walk away.</p><p>Tell me what you were thinking about when I was on the phone.\"</p><p>My lips twisted wryly.</p><p>\"How gorgeous you are.</p><p>It's sickening how often I think about that.</p><p>I need to get over it already.\"</p><p>He cupped the back of my thigh and urged me tighter against him, teasing me with an expert roll of his hips against mine.</p><p>He was outrageously gifted in bed.</p><p>And he knew it.</p><p>\"Damned if I'll let you.\"</p><p>\"Oh?\" Heat slid sinuously through my veins, my body too greedy for the feel of his.</p><p>\"You can't tell me you want another starry-eyed woman hanging on you, Mr.</p><p>Hates-Exaggerated- Expectations.\"</p><p>\"What I want,\" he purred, cupping my jaw and rubbing my bottom lip with the pad of his thumb, \"is you being too busy thinking about me to think about anyone else.\"</p><p>I pulled in a slow and shaky breath.</p><p>I was completely seduced by the smoldering look in his eyes, the provocative tone of his voice, the heat of his body, and the mouthwatering scent of his skin.</p><p>He was my drug, and I had no desire to kick the habit.</p><p>\"Gideon,\" I breathed, entranced.</p><p>With a soft groan, he sealed his chiseled mouth over mine, stealing away thoughts of what time it was with a lush, deep kiss .</p><p>a kiss that almost succeeded in distracting me from seeing the insecurity he'd just revealed.</p><p>I pushed my fingers into his hair to hold him still and kissed him back, my tongue sliding along his, stroking.</p><p>We'd been a couple for such a short period of time.</p><p>Less than a month.</p><p>Worse, neither of us knew how to have a relationship like the one we were attempting to build - a relationship in which we refused to pretend we weren't both seriously broken.</p><p>His arms banded around me and tightened possessively.</p><p>\"I wanted to spend the weekend with you down in the Florida Keys - naked.\"</p><p>\"Umm, sounds nice.\"</p><p>More than nice.</p><p>As big of a kick as I got out of Gideon in a three-piece suit, I much preferred him stripped to the skin.</p><p>I avoided pointing out that I wouldn't be available this weekend .</p><p>\"Now I've got to spend the weekend taking care of business,\" he muttered, his lips moving against mine.</p><p>\"Business you put off to be with me?\" He'd been leaving work early to spend time with me, and I knew that had to be costing him.</p><p>My mother was on her third marriage, and all of her spouses were successful, wealthy moguls of one kind or another.</p><p>I knew the price for ambition was very late hours.</p><p>\"I pay other people a generous salary so I can be with you.\"</p><p>Nice dodge, but noting the flash of irritation in his gaze, I distracted him.</p><p>\"Thank you.</p><p>Let's get some coffee before we run out of time.\"</p><p>Gideon stroked his tongue along my bottom lip, then released me.</p><p>\"I'd like to get off the ground by eight tomorrow night.</p><p>Pack cool and light.</p><p>Arizona's got dry heat.\"</p><p>\"What?\" I blinked at his retreating back as it disappeared into his office. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Arizona is where your business is?\" \"Unfortunately.\"</p><p>Uh .</p><p>Instead of risking my shot at coffee, I postponed arguing and continued on to the kitchen.</p> <p>I passed through Gideon's spacious apartment with its stunning prewar architecture and slender arched windows, my heels alternately clicking over gleaming hardwood and muffled by Aubusson rugs.</p><p>Decorated in dark woods and neutral fabrics, the luxurious space was brightened by jeweled accents.</p><p>As much as his place screamed money, it managed to remain warm and welcoming, a comfortable place to relax and feel pampered.</p><p>When I reached the kitchen, I wasted no time in shoving a travel mug under the one-cup coffeemaker.</p><p>Gideon joined me with his jacket draped over one arm and his cell phone in his hand.</p> <p>I put another portable mug under the spout for him before I went to the fridge for some half-and-half.</p><p>\"It might be fortunate after all.\"</p><p>I faced him and reminded him of my roommate issue.</p><p>\"I need to knock heads with Cary this weekend.\"</p><p>Gideon dropped his phone in the inner pocket of his jacket, then hung the garment off the back of one of the bar stools at the island.</p><p>\"You're coming with me, Eva.\"</p> <p>Exhaling in a rush, I added half- and-half to my coffee.</p><p>\"To do what?

He'd wanted me the moment he saw me on the street.</p><p>\"I wondered.\"</p><p>Megumi pushed through the revolving lobby door.</p><p>\"I read that it was serious between you two,\" she went on when I joined her outside on the sidewalk.</p><p>\"So I thought maybe you'd known him before.\"</p><p>\"Don't believe everything you read on those gossip blogs.\"</p><p>\"So it's not serious?\" \"I didn't say that.\"</p><p>It was too serious at times.</p><p>Painfully, brutally so.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\"God .</p><p>listen to me pry.</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>Gossip is one of my vices.</p><p>So are extremely hot men like Gideon Cross.</p><p>I can't help but wonder what it'd be like to hook up with a guy whose body screams sex like that.</p><p>Tell me he's awesome in bed.\"</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>It was good to hang out with another girl.</p><p>Not that Cary couldn't also be appreciative of a hot guy, but nothing beat girl talk.</p><p>\"You won't hear me complaining.\"</p><p>\"Lucky bitch.\"</p><p>Bumping shoulders with me to show she was teasing, she said, \"How about that roommate of yours? From the photos I saw, he's gorgeous, too.</p><p>Is he single? Wanna hook me up?\" Turning my head quickly, I hid a wince.</p><p>I'd learned the hard way never to set up an acquaintance or friend with Cary.</p><p>He was so easy to love, which led to a lot of broken hearts because he couldn't love back the same way.</p><p>The moment things started going too well, Cary sabotaged them.</p><p>\"I don't know if he's single or not.</p><p>Things are .</p><p>complicated in his life at the moment.\"</p><p>\"Well, if the opportunity presents itself, I'm certainly not opposed.</p><p>Just sayin'.</p><p>You like tacos?\" \"Love 'em.\"</p><p>\"I know a great place a couple blocks up.</p><p>Come on.\"</p><p>Things were going well in my world as Megumi and I headed back from lunch.</p><p>Forty minutes of gossip, guy-ogling, and three awesome carne asada tacos later, I was feeling pretty good.</p><p>And we were returning to work a little over ten minutes early, which I was glad for since I hadn't been the most punctual employee lately, even though Mark never complained.</p><p>The city was thrumming around us, taxis and people surging through the growing heat and humidity as they crammed what they could into the insufficient hours of the day.</p><p>I people- watched shamelessly, my eyes skimming over everyone and everything.</p><p>Men in business suits walked alongside women in flowing skirts and flip-flops.</p><p>Ladies in haute couture and five-hundred-dollar shoes teetered past steaming hot dog vendor carts and shouting hawkers.</p><p>The eclectic mix of New York was heaven to me, stirring an excitement that made me feel more vibrant here than anyplace else I'd ever lived.</p><p>We were stopped by a traffic light directly across from the Crossfire, and my gaze was immediately drawn to the black Bentley sitting in front of it.</p><p>Gideon must've just gotten back from lunch.</p><p>I couldn't help but think about him sitting in his car on the day we'd met, watching me as I took in the imposing beauty of his Crossfire Building.</p><p>It made me tingly just thinking about it - Suddenly, I went cold.</p><p>Because a striking brunette breezed out of the revolving doors just then and paused, giving me a good, long look at her - Gideon's ideal, whether he'd been aware of it or not.</p><p>A woman I'd witnessed him fixate on the moment he'd seen her in the Waldorf Astoria ballroom.</p><p>A woman whose poise and hold over Gideon brought out all my worst insecurities.</p><p>Corinne Giroux looked like a breath of fresh air in a cream-colored sheath dress and cherry red heels.</p><p>She ran a hand over her waist-length dark hair, which wasn't quite as sleek as it'd appeared last night when I'd met her.</p><p>In fact, it looked a little disheveled.</p><p>And her fingers were rubbing at her mouth, wiping along the outline of her lips.I pulled my smartphone out, activated the camera, and snapped a picture.</p><p>With the proximity of the zoom, I could see why she was fussing with her lipstick - it was smeared.</p><p>No, more like mashed.</p><p>As if from a passionate kiss.</p><p>The light changed.</p><p>Megumi and I moved with the flow, closing the distance between me and the woman who'd once had Gideon's promise to marry her.</p><p>Angus stepped out of the Bentley and came around, speaking to her briefly before opening the back door for her.</p><p>The feeling of betrayal - Angus's and Gideon's - was so fierce, I couldn't catch my breath.</p><p>I swayed on my feet.</p><p>\"Hey.\"</p><p>Megumi caught my arm to steady me.</p><p>\"And we only had virgin margaritas, lightweight!\" I watched Corinne's willowy body slide into the back of Gideon's car with practiced grace.</p><p>My fists clenched as fury surged through me.</p><p>Through the haze of my angry tears, the Bentley pulled away from the curb and disappeared.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>When Megumi and I stepped into an elevator, I hit the button for the top floor.</p><p>\"I'll be back in five minutes, if anyone asks,\" I told her, as she stepped off at Waters Field &amp; Leaman.</p><p>\"Give him a kiss for me, will you?\" she said, playfully fanning herself.</p><p>\"Makes me hot just thinking about living vicariously through you.\"</p><p>I managed a smile before the doors closed and the car continued its ascent.</p><p>When it reached the end of the line, I exited into a tastefully ornate and undeniably masculine entrance foyer.</p><p>Smoky glass security doors were sandblasted with CROSS INDUSTRIES and softened by hanging baskets of ferns and lilies.</p><p>Gideon's redheaded receptionist was unusually cooperative and buzzed me in before I reached the door.</p><p>Then she grinned at me in a way that got my back up.</p><p>I'd always gotten the impression she didn't like me, so I didn't trust that smile for a minute. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\"

wasn't a catty bitch - unless I was given good reason to be.</p><p>I took the long hallway that led to Gideon, stopping at a large secondary reception area where his secretary, Scott, manned the desk.</p><p>Scott stood as I approached.</p> <p>\"Hello, Eva,\" he greeted me, reaching for his phone.</p><p>\"I'll let him know you're here.\"</p><p>The glass wall that separated Gideon's office from the rest of the floor was usually crystal clear but could be made opaque with the push of a button.</p><p>It was frosted now, which increased my uneasiness.</p><p>\"Is he alone?\" \"Yes, but - \" Whatever else he said was lost as I pushed through the glass door and into Gideon's domain.</p> <p>It was a massive space, with three distinct seating areas, each larger than my boss Mark's entire office.</p><p>In contrast to the elegant warmth of Gideon's apartment, his office was decorated in a cool palette of black, gray, and white broken only by the jewel-toned crystal decanters that decorated the wall behind a bar.</p><p>Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooked the city on two sides.</p><p>The one solid wall opposite the immense desk was covered in flat screens streaming news channels from around the world.</p><p>My gaze swept the room and caught on the throw pillow that had been carelessly knocked to the floor.</p><p>Beside it were indents in the area rug that betrayed where the couch feet were usually planted.</p> <p>The piece of furniture had, apparently, been bumped askew by a few inches.</p><p>My heart rate sped up and my palms grew damp.</p><p>That awful anxiety I'd felt earlier intensified.</p><p>I had just noticed the open door to the washroom when Gideon stepped into view, stealing my breath with the beauty of his exposed torso.</p><p>His hair was damp, as if from a recent shower, and his neck and upper chest were still flushed, as it became when he exerted himself physically.</p><p>He froze when he saw me, his gaze darkening for an instant before his perfect, implacable mask slid effortlessly into place.</p><p>\"It's not a good time, Eva,\" he said, shrugging into a dress shirt he'd had draped over the back of a bar stool .</p><p>a different shirt from the one he'd been wearing earlier that morning.</p> <p>\"I'm running late to an appointment.\"</p><p>I gripped my purse tightly.</p><p>Seeing him so intimately brought home how badly I wanted him.</p><p>I loved him insanely, needed him like I needed to breathe .</p><p>which only made it easier for me to understand how Magdalene and Corinne felt, and to relate to any lengths they might go to in trying to lure him away from me.</p><p>\"Why are you half dressed?\" There was no help for it.</p><p>My body responded instinctively to the sight of his, which made it even harder for me to rein in my rioting emotions.</p><p>His open, neatly pressed dress shirt revealed golden skin stretched tightly over washboard abs and perfectly defined pectorals.</p><p>A dusting of dark hair over his chest arrowed down and darkened into a thin line, leading to a cock presently encased in boxer briefs and slacks.</p><p>Just thinking about how he felt inside me made me ache with longing.</p><p>\"I got something on my shirt.\"</p><p>He began buttoning up, his abs flexing with his movements as he crossed over to the bar, where I saw his cuff links waiting.</p><p>\"I have to run.</p><p>If you need something, let Scott know and he'll see to it.</p><p>Or I'll take care of it when I get back.</p><p>I shouldn't be more than two hours.\"</p><p>\"Why are you running late?\" He didn't look at me when he answered, \"I had to squeeze in a last- minute meeting.\"</p><p>Did you now? \"You showered this morning.\"</p><p>After making love to me for an hour.</p><p>\"Why did you have to shower again?\" \"Why the inquisition?\" he snapped.</p><p>Needing answers, I went to the washroom.</p><p>The lingering humidity was oppressive.</p><p>Ignoring the voice in my head telling me not to look for trouble I couldn't bear to find, I dug his shirt out of the laundry basket .</p><p>and saw red lipstick smeared like a bloodstain on one of the cuffs.</p><p>Pain twisted through my chest.</p><p>Dropping the garment on the floor, I pivoted and left, needing to get as far away from Gideon as possible.</p><p>Before I threw up or started sobbing.</p><p>\"Eva!\" he snapped as I hurried past him.</p><p>\"What the hell is the matter with you?\" \"Fuck you, asswipe.\"</p><p>\"Excuse me?\" My hand was on the door handle when he caught me, yanking me back by the elbow.</p><p>Spinning, I slapped him with enough force to turn his head and set my palm on fire.</p><p>\"Goddamn it,\" he growled, grabbing me by the arms and shaking me.</p><p>\"Don't fucking hit me!\" \"Don't touch me!\" The feel of his bare hands on the bare skin of my arms was too much.</p><p>He shoved back and away from me.</p><p>\"What the fuck's gotten into you?\" \"I saw her, Gideon.\"</p><p>\"Saw who?\" \"Corinne!\" He scowled.</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" Pulling my smartphone out, I thrust the photo in his face.</p><p>\"Busted.\"</p><p>Gideon's gaze narrowed on the screen, and then his scowl cleared.</p><p>\"Busted doing what, exactly?\" he asked, too softly.</p><p>\"Oh, screw you.\"</p><p>I turned toward the door, shoving my phone in my purse.</p><p>\"I'm not spelling it out for you.\"</p><p>His palm slapped against the glass, holding the door closed.</p><p>Caging me with his body, he leaned down and hissed in my ear, \"Yes.</p><p>Yes, you goddamn will spell it out.\"</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut as our position at the door brought back a flood of heated memories from the first time I'd been in Gideon's office.</p><p>He'd stopped me just like this, seducing me deftly, drawing us into a passionate embrace on the very couch that had recently seen some kind of action forceful enough to shove it out of position.</p><p>\"Doesn't a picture say a thousand words?\" I bit out through clenched teeth.</p><p>\"So Corinne was manhandled.</p><p>What does that have to do with me?\" \"Are you kidding me? Let me out.\"</p><p>\"I don't find anything even remotely funny about this.</p><p>In fact, I don't think I've ever been this pissed off at a woman.</p><p>You come in here with your half-assed accusations and self- righteous bullshit - \" \"I am righteous!\" I twisted around and ducked beneath his arm, putting some much-needed distance between us.</p><p>Being close to him hurt too much.</p><p>\"I would never cheat on you! If I wanted to fuck around, I'd break it off with you first.\"</p><p>Leaning into the door, Gideon crossed his arms.</p><p>His shirt remained untucked and open at the collar, a look I found hot and tempting, which only made me angrier.</p><p>\"You think I cheated on you?\" His tone was clipped and icy.</p><p>I sucked in a deep breath to get through the pain of imagining him with Corinne on the sofa behind me.</p><p>\"Explain to me why she was here at the Crossfire, looking like she did.</p><p>Why your office looks like this.</p><p>Why you look like that.\"</p><p>His gaze went to the couch, then to the cushion on the floor, then back to me.</p><p>\"I don't know why Corinne was here or why she looked like that.</p><p>I haven't seen her since last night, when you were with me.\"</p><p>Last night seemed like it'd happened forever ago.</p><p>I wished that it had never happened at all.</p><p>\"But I wasn't with you,\" I pointed out.</p><p>\"She batted her eyelashes and said she wanted to introduce you to someone, and you left me standing there.\"</p><p>\"Christ.\"</p><p>His eyes blazed.</p><p>\"Not this again.\"</p><p>I swiped angrily at a tear that slid down my cheek.</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\"You think I went with her because I was overcome with the need to be with her and get away from you?\" \"I don't know, Gideon.</p><p>You ditched me.</p><p>You're the one with the answers.\"</p><p>\"You ditched me first.\"</p><p>My mouth fell open.</p><p>\"I did not!\" \"The hell you didn't.</p><p>Almost the second we arrived, you took off.</p><p>I had to hunt you down and when I did, you were dancing with that prick.\"</p><p>\"Martin is Stanton's nephew!\" And since Richard Stanton was my stepdad, I thought of Martin as family.</p><p>\"I don't care if he's a damned priest.</p><p>He wants to nail you.\"</p><p>\"Oh my God.</p><p>That's absurd! Stop deflecting.</p><p>You were talking business with your associates.</p><p>It was awkward standing there.</p><p>For them as well as me.\"</p><p>\"That's your place, awkward or not!\"My head jerked back as if he'd slapped me.</p><p>\"Come again?\" \"How would you feel if I walked away from you at a Waters Field and Leaman party because you started talking about a campaign? Then, when you found me, I was slow dancing with Magdalene?\" \"I - \" God.</p><p>I hadn't thought of it like that.</p><p>Gideon appeared smooth and unruffled with his powerful frame lounging against the door, but I could sense the anger vibrating beneath that calm surface.</p><p>He was riveting always, but most especially when he was seething with passion.</p><p>\"It's my place to stand beside you, and support you, and yes, just fucking look pretty on your arm sometimes.</p><p>It's my right, my duty, and my privilege, Eva, just as it's yours in reverse.\"</p><p>\"I thought I was doing you a favor by getting out of the way.\"</p><p>His arched brow was a silent, sarcastic comeback.</p><p>My arms crossed in front of me.</p><p>\"Is that why you walked off with Corinne? Were you punishing me?\" \"If I wanted to punish you, Eva, I'd take you over my knee.\"</p><p>My gaze narrowed.</p><p>That was never going to happen.</p><p>\"I know how you get,\" he said curtly.</p><p>\"I didn't want you jealous over Corinne before I had a chance to explain.</p><p>I needed a few minutes to make sure she understood how serious you and I are, and how important it was to me that you enjoy the evening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That's the only reason I walked away with her.\"</p><p>\"You told her not to say anything about you two, didn't you?

to the Crossfire was literally across the street, but something in Clancy's tone brooked no argument.</p><p>We all climbed in, with my mother taking the front seat.</p><p>\"What was that about?\" Megumi asked after we'd been dropped off and had moved into the cool interior of the building.</p><p>\"Your mom looked like she'd seen a ghost.\"</p><p>\"I have no idea.\"</p><p>But I felt ill.</p><p>Something had frightened my mother.</p><p>It was going to drive me crazy until I found out what it was.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>My back hit the mat with enough force to knock the air from my lungs.</p><p>Stunned, I blinked up at the ceiling, trying to catch my breath.</p><p>Parker Smith's face came into view.</p><p>\"You're wasting my time.</p><p>If you're going to be here, be here.</p><p>One hundred percent.</p><p>Not a million miles away in your head somewhere.\"</p><p>I grabbed the hand he extended to me, and he yanked me to my feet.</p><p>Around us, a dozen more of Parker's Krav Maga students were hard at work.</p><p>The Brooklyn-based studio was alive with noise and activity.</p><p>He was right.</p><p>My thoughts were still stuck on my mom and the bizarre way she'd reacted when we returned to the Crossfire after lunch.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"I've got something on my mind.\"</p><p>He moved like lightning, tagging me first on one knee, then my shoulder with rapid-fire slaps.</p><p>\"Do you think an attacker is going to wait until you're alert and ready before he comes after you?\" I crouched, forcing myself to focus.</p><p>Parker crouched as well, his brown eyes hard and watchful.</p><p>His shaved head and cafe au lait skin gleamed beneath the overhead fluorescent lighting.</p><p>The studio was in a converted warehouse, which had been left rough for both economic reasons and atmosphere.</p><p>My mother and stepfather were paranoid enough to have Clancy accompany me to my classes.</p><p>The neighborhood was presently undergoing revitalization, which I thought was encouraging but they thought was troubling.</p><p>When Parker came at me again, I blocked him.</p><p>The tagging came fast and furious then, and I pushed all other thoughts aside until later, when I was home.</p><p>When Gideon came over about an hour later, he found me in the bath surrounded by vanilla-scented candles.</p><p>He undressed to join me, even though his damp hair told me he'd already showered after spending time with his own personal trainer.</p><p>I watched him strip, riveted.</p><p>The play of muscles beneath his skin and the inherent gracefulness in the way he moved sent a delicious sense of contentment sliding through me.</p><p>He climbed into the deep oval tub behind me, his long legs sliding in on either side of mine.</p><p>His arms wrapped around me, and then he surprised me by lifting me up and back, so that I was sitting on his lap and my legs were draped over his.</p><p>\"Lean into me, angel,\" he murmured.</p><p>\"I need to feel you.\"</p><p>I sighed with pleasure, sinking into the hardness of his powerful body as he cradled me.</p><p>My aching muscles softened in surrender, eager as always to become completely pliable to his touch.</p><p>I loved moments like this, when the world and our emotional triggers were far away.</p><p>Moments when I felt the love he wouldn't profess for me.</p><p>\"Soaking more bruises?\" he asked with his cheek pressed to mine.</p><p>\"My fault.</p><p>My head wasn't in the game.\"</p><p>\"Thinking about me?\" he purred, nuzzling against my ear.</p><p>\"I wish.\"</p><p>He paused, then switched gears.</p><p>\"Tell me what's bugging you.\"</p><p>I loved how easily he could read me, then revise and revisit his approach on the fly.</p><p>I tried to be as adaptable for him.</p><p>Really, flexibility was a requirement in a relationship between two high-maintenance people.</p><p>Linking my fingers with his, I told him about my mother's weird reaction after lunch.</p><p>\"I almost expected to turn around and see my dad or something.</p><p>I was wondering .</p><p>You have security cameras that cover the front of the building, don't you?\" \"Of course.</p><p>I'll look into it.\"</p><p>\"It's a ten-minute window of time, max.</p><p>I just want to see if I can figure out what went on.\"</p><p>\"Consider it done.\"</p><p>I tilted my head back and kissed his jaw.</p><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><p>His lips pressed to the top of my shoulder.</p><p>\"Angel, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.\"</p><p>\"Including talking about your past?\" I felt him tense and mentally kicked myself.</p><p>\"Not right this second,\" I hastened to add, \"but sometime.</p><p>Just tell me we'll get there.\"</p><p>\"Have lunch with me tomorrow.</p><p>In my office.\"</p><p>\"Are you going to talk about it then?\" Gideon exhaled harshly.</p><p>\"Eva.\"</p><p>I turned my face away and released him, disappointed with his evasion.</p><p>Reaching for the edges of the tub, I prepared to get out and away from the man who somehow made me feel more connected to another human being than I'd ever been, yet impossibly distant as well.</p><p>Being with him fucked with my head, made me doubt the very things I'd been sure of just moments before.</p><p>Rinse and repeat.</p><p>\"I'm done,\" I muttered, blowing out the nearest candle.</p><p>Smoke curled up and away, as intangible as my grasp on the man I loved.</p><p>\"I'm getting out.\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>He cupped my breasts, restraining me.</p><p>Water lapped around us, as agitated as I was.</p><p>\"Let go, Gideon.\"</p><p>I caught his wrists to pull his hands away.</p><p>He buried his face in my neck, obstinately holding on.</p><p>\"We'll get there.</p><p>Okay? Just - We'll get there.\"</p><p>I deflated, feeling little of the triumph I had hoped to feel when I'd first asked and anticipated his answer.</p><p>\"Can we give it a rest tonight?\" he asked gruffly, still clinging tight.</p><p>\"Give it all a rest? I just want to be with you, all right? Order something in for dinner, watch TV, hold you when I sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Can we do that?\" Realizing something was seriously off, I twisted to face him.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" \"I just want some time with you.\"</p><p>My eyes stung with tears.</p> <p>There was more he wasn't telling me, so much more.</p><p>Our relationship was swiftly becoming a minefield of words left unsaid and secrets not shared.</p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p>\"I need it, Eva.</p><p>You and me with no drama.\"</p> <p>His wet fingertips brushed across my cheek.</p><p>\"Give me that.</p><p>Please.</p><p>Then give me a kiss.\"</p><p>Turning around, I straddled his hips and cupped his face in my hands.</p><p>I angled my head to find the perfect approach and pressed my lips to his.</p> <p>I started out soft and slow, licking and suckling.</p><p>I tugged on his bottom lip, then coaxed him to forget our problems with teasing strokes of my tongue along his.</p><p>\"Kiss me, damn it,\" he growled, his hands bracketing my spine and kneading restlessly.</p><p>\"Kiss me like you love me.\"</p><p>\"I do,\" I promised, breathing the words into him.</p><p>\"I can't help it.\"</p><p>\"Angel.\"</p><p>Pushing his hands into my damp hair, he held me how he wanted me and kissed me senseless.</p> <p>After dinner, Gideon worked in bed, propping his back against my headboard and his laptop on a lap desk.</p><p>I sprawled on the bed on my belly, facing the TV and kicking my feet in the air.</p><p>\"Do you know every line in this movie?\" he asked, luring me to turn my attention away from Ghostbusters to look at him.</p><p>He wore black boxer briefs and nothing else.</p><p>I loved that I got to see him that way - relaxed, comfortable, intimate.</p><p>I wondered if Corinne had ever seen this view.</p><p>If so, I could imagine her desperation to see it again, because I was desperate to never lose the privilege.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" I conceded.</p><p>\"And you have to say them all aloud?\" \"Got a problem with that, ace?\" \"No.\"</p><p>Amusement lit his eyes and curved his mouth.</p><p>\"How many times have you seen it?\" \"A gazillion times.\"</p><p>I curved around and rose up on my hands and knees.</p><p>\"Want more?\" A dark winged brow rose.</p><p>\"Are you the keymaster?\" I purred, crawling forward.</p><p>\"Angel, when you're looking at me like that, I'm whatever you want me to be.\"</p><p>I looked at him beneath lowered eyelids and breathed, \"Do you want this body?\" Grinning, he set his lap desk aside.</p><p>\"All the damn time.\"</p><p>Straddling his legs, I climbed his torso.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and growled, \"Kiss me, subcreature.\"</p><p>\"That's not how that line goes.</p><p>And what happened to me being a pleasure god?

tongue.</p><p>His thighs bunched, his breath came in fierce pants.</p><p>I felt him coil tight and I went wild, double-fisting him, my mouth working so hard that my jaw ached.</p> <p>His spine straightened, his head lifting from the seat only to slam backward as the first thick spurt exploded in my mouth.</p><p>I whimpered, his flavor igniting my senses, making me crave more.</p><p>I swallowed convulsively, my hands pulling and rubbing on his throbbing penis to lure more of his rich, creamy semen onto my tongue.</p><p>His body quaked as he came for long minutes, filling my mouth until he spilled out of the sides of my lips.</p><p>He made no sound, as unnaturally silent as he'd been during the fight.</p><p>I would've sucked him off for hours.</p><p>I wanted to, but he put both

askew.</p><p>My lower lip trembled.</p><p>\"I don't know.\"</p><p>He released me, reaching up and over his shoulders with both hands to grip the sides of the headrest.</p><p>His biceps bulged with the pose.</p><p>I was aroused by the sight, as I was by everything about him.</p><p>I wanted to see his bare chest glistening with sweat, his abs tightening and flexing as he pumped his cock into me.</p><p>I licked my lips, tasting him.</p><p>\"Take your shirt off.\"</p><p>His gaze narrowed.</p><p>\"This isn't for you.\"</p><p>I stilled, my heart racing in my chest.</p><p>He was using sex against me.</p><p>In the limo where we'd first made love, in the same position I'd first taken him .</p><p>\"You're punishing me.\"</p><p>\"You've earned it.\"</p><p>It didn't matter that he was right.</p><p>If I'd earned it, so had he.</p><p>I gripped the top of the seat back for balance and wrapped the fingers of my other hand around his cock.</p><p>He was still hard, still throbbing.</p><p>A muscle in his neck twitched as I stroked him in my fist, priming him.</p><p>I placed the wide crest between the lips of my cleft, rubbing him back and forth, coating him with the slickness of my desire.</p><p>My gaze never left his.</p><p>I watched him as I teased us both, looking for any sign of the passionate lover I adored.</p><p>He wasn't there.</p><p>A furious stranger glared back at me, daring me, taunting me with his detachment.</p><p>I let the first thick inch push inside me, spreading me open.</p><p>Then I slammed my hips down, crying out as he pierced me deep and stretched me almost unbearably.</p><p>\"Jesus.</p><p>Fuck,\" he bit out, shuddering.</p><p>\"Goddamn it.\"</p><p>His uncontrolled outburst spurred me.</p><p>Digging my knees into the seat, I set my hands on either side of his and lifted, pulling off him, my trembling sex clinging tightly.</p><p>I pushed back down, the glide easier now that he was wet from me.</p><p>When my buttocks hit his thighs I found his muscles hard as stone, his body giving away the lie - he wasn't indifferent.</p><p>I lifted again, slowly, making us both feel every nuance of the delicious friction.</p><p>When I pushed back down, I tried to be as stoic as he was, but the sensation of fullness, the heated connection, was too exquisite to contain.</p><p>I moaned, and he shifted restlessly, his hips moving in a delicious little circle before he could stop himself.</p><p>\"You feel so good,\" I whispered, stroking his raging cock with my eager, aching sex.</p><p>Sliding up and down.</p><p>\"You're all I need, Gideon.</p><p>All I want.</p><p>You were made for me.\"</p><p>\"You forgot that,\" he bit out, his knuckles white from his grip on the seat back.</p><p>I wondered if he was just holding on or physically restraining himself from reaching for me.</p><p>\"Never.</p><p>I could never forget.</p><p>You're a part of me.\"</p><p>\"Tell me why you kissed him.\"</p><p>\"I don't know.\"</p><p>I rested my damp forehead against his, feeling the tears burning behind my eyes.</p><p>\"God, Gideon.</p><p>I swear I don't know.\"</p><p>\"Then shut up and make me come.\"</p><p>If he'd slapped my face, it couldn't have shocked me more.</p><p>I straightened and leaned away from him.</p><p>\"Fuck you.\"</p><p>\"Now you're getting the idea.\"</p><p>Hot tears slid down my face.</p><p>\"Don't treat me like a whore.\"</p><p>\"Eva.\"</p><p>His voice was low and raspy, filled with warning, but his eyes were dark and desolate.</p><p>Filled with pain that matched my own.</p><p>\"You want to stop, you know what to say.\"</p><p>Crossfire.</p><p>With one word I could unmistakably, irrefutably put an end to this agony.</p><p>But I couldn't use it now.</p><p>Just the fact that he brought up my safe word told me he was testing me.</p><p>Pushing me.</p><p>He had an agenda, and if I gave up now, I'd never know what it was.Reaching behind me, I set my hands on his knees.</p><p>I arched my back and dragged my soaked sex along the rigid length of his cock, then slammed back down.</p><p>I adjusted the angle, lifted and fell again, gasping at the feel of him.</p><p>Mad as hell or not, my body worshipped his.</p><p>Loved the feel of him, the sense of rightness that was there despite the anger and hurt.</p><p>His breath was powering out of his lungs with every plunge of my hips.</p><p>His body was hot, so hot, radiating heat like a blast furnace.</p><p>I pumped my hips.</p><p>Up.</p><p>Down.</p><p>Taking the pleasure he refused to give me.</p><p>My thighs, buttocks, stomach, and core tightened with every lift, fisting him from root to tip.</p><p>They relaxed when I dropped, letting him sink deep.</p><p>I fucked him with everything I had, pounding myself onto his cock.</p><p>His breath hissed out between his clenched teeth.</p><p>Then he was coming hard, jetting inside me so fiercely I felt each scorching burst of semen like a separate thrust.</p><p>I cried out, loving the feel of it, chasing an orgasm that would shatter me.</p><p>I was wound so tightly, my body desperate for release after pleasing him twice.</p><p>But he moved, grabbing me by the waist and restraining my movements, holding himself deep as he pumped me full.</p><p>I choked off a scream when I realized he was deliberately preventing me from coming.</p><p>\"Tell me why, Eva,\" he growled.</p><p>\"Why?\" \"I don't know!\" I yelled, trying to grind my hips onto him, pounding his shoulders with my fists when his grip tightened.</p><p>Holding me pinned to his pelvis and filled with his cock, Gideon pushed to his feet and everything shifted.</p><p>He pulled out of me, flipped me to face away from him, then bent me over the edge of the seat with my knees on the floorboard.</p><p>With one hand at the small of my back, holding me down, he cupped my sex and rubbed, massaging his semen into my cleft.</p><p>He spread it around, coating me with it.</p><p>My hips circled, seeking that perfect bit of pressure to get me off .</p><p>He kept it from me.</p><p>Deliberately.</p><p>The pounding in my clit and the needy clenching of my empty core was driving me mad, my body hungry for release.</p><p>He pushed two fingers into me and my nails dug into the black leather seat.</p><p>He finger-fucked me leisurely, sliding lazily in and out, keeping me on the edge.</p><p>\"Gideon,\" I sobbed, the sensitive tissues inside me rippling greedily around him.</p><p>I was coated in sweat, barely able to breathe.</p><p>I began to pray for the car to stop, for us to reach our destination, holding my breath in desperate anticipation of escape.</p><p>But the limo never pulled over.</p><p>It kept driving and driving, and I was restrained so completely that I couldn't rise up enough to see where we were. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1,

How bad it hurts, you self- centered asshole!\" He stilled.</p><p>I felt his breath heave out of him.</p><p>My blood was roaring in my ears, so loudly that at first I thought I was deliriously imagining his voice softening with tenderness.</p><p>\"Angel.\"</p><p>His lips brushed over my shoulder blade, his hands releasing my wrists to slide beneath me and cup my full, heavy breasts.</p><p>\"My stubborn, beautiful angel.</p><p>Finally, we get to the truth.\"</p><p>Gideon lifted me up, straightening me.</p><p>Exhausted, my head lolled against his shoulder, my tears dripping onto my chest.</p><p>I had nothing left to fight with, barely able to whimper when he rolled an aching nipple between his fingertips and reached between my splayed legs.</p><p>His hips began to lunge, his cock pumping upward into me as he pinched the lips of my sex around my throbbing clit and rubbed.</p><p>I came with a hoarse cry of his name, my entire body convulsing in fierce tremors as the relief exploded through me.</p><p>The orgasm lasted forever and Gideon was tireless, extending my pleasure with the perfect thrusts I'd been so frantic for earlier.</p><p>When I finally collapsed in his arms, panting and soaked with sweat, he lifted me carefully off him and placed me lengthwise on the bench seat.</p><p>Shattered, I covered my face with my hands, incapable of stopping him when he pushed my thighs apart and put his mouth on me.</p><p>I was soaked with his semen and he didn't care, tonguing and suckling my clit until I came again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>My back arched with each orgasm, my breath soughing from my lungs.</p><p>I lost track of how many times I climaxed after they began rolling into each other, cresting and waning like the tide.</p><p>I tried to curl away from him, but he just straightened and yanked his shirt off, climbing over me with one knee on the seat and the other leg extended to the floor.</p><p>He placed his hands on the window above my head, putting his body on display as he'd refused to do before.</p><p>I shoved at him.</p><p>\"No more! I can't take any more.\"</p><p>\"I know.\"</p><p>His abs tightened as he slid into me, his eyes on my face as he pushed carefully through swollen tissues.</p><p>\"I just want to be inside you.\"</p><p>My neck arched as he slid deeper, a low sound escaping me because it felt sooo good.</p><p>As worn out and overstimulated as I was, I still craved to possess him and to be possessed by him.</p><p>I knew I always would.</p><p>Bending his head, he pressed his lips to my forehead.</p><p>\"You're all I want, Eva.</p><p>There's no one else.</p><p>There will never be anyone else.\"</p><p>\"Gideon.\"</p><p>He understood, as I hadn't, that the night had fallen apart because of my jealousy and the deep- seated need I had to make him feel it for himself.</p><p>He kissed me softly, reverently, erasing every memory of anyone else's lips on mine.</p><p>\"Angel.\"</p><p>Gideon's voice was a warm rasp in my ear.</p><p>\"Wake up.\"</p><p>I moaned, squeezing my eyes shut tighter and burying my face deeper in his neck.</p><p>\"Leave me alone, you sex fiend.\"</p><p>His silent laughter shook me.</p><p>He pressed a hard kiss to my forehead and wiggled out from under me.</p><p>\"We're here.\"</p><p>Cracking one eye open, I watched him put his shirt back on.</p><p>He'd never gotten out of his jeans.</p><p>I realized the sun was out.</p><p>I sat up and looked out the windows, gasping when I saw the ocean.</p><p>We'd stopped for gas once but I hadn't been able to get my bearings or figure out where we were.</p><p>Gideon had declined to tell me when I asked, saying only that it was a surprise.</p><p>\"Where are we?\" I breathed, thrilled by the sight of the sun climbing over the water.</p><p>It had to be solidly into morning.</p><p>Maybe even midmorning.</p><p>\"North Carolina.</p><p>Lift your arms.\"</p><p>I obeyed automatically, and he slid my tank top over my head.</p><p>\"I need my bra,\" I muttered, when I could see him again.</p><p>\"No one's here to see you but me and we're going straight into the bathtub.\"</p><p>I looked again at the weathered shingle-covered building we'd parked beside.</p><p>It was at least three stories, with wraparound decks and balconies on the front and sides, and a quaint single-door entrance off the back.</p><p>It stood on stilts at the shoreline, so close to the water that I knew the tide must come up right beneath it.</p><p>\"How long have we been driving?\" \"Almost ten hours.\"</p><p>Gideon slid my skirt up my legs and I stood, allowing him to twist it straight and pull up the zipper.</p><p>\"Let's go.\"</p><p>He got out first, then held his hand out for me.</p><p>The bracing, salty breeze hit my face, waking me.</p><p>The rhythmic surge of the ocean grounded me to the moment and where we were.</p><p>Angus was nowhere to be seen, which was a relief, since I was very aware of my lack of underwear.</p><p>\"Angus drove all night?\" \"We switched drivers when we stopped for gas.\"</p><p>I looked at Gideon and my pulse stuttered at the tender, haunted way he was looking at me.</p><p>A shadow of a bruise marred his jaw and I reached up to touch it, my chest aching when he nuzzled into my palm.</p><p>\"Are you hurt anywhere else?\" I asked, feeling so emotionally raw after the long night we'd had.</p><p>He caught my wrist and pulled my hand down to press flat over his heart.</p><p>\"Here.\"</p><p>My love .</p><p>It had been hard on him, too.</p><p>\"I'm so sorry.\"</p><p>\"So am I.\"</p><p>He kissed my fingertips, then linked our hands and led me up to the house.</p><p>The door was unlocked and he walked right in.</p><p>A wire mesh basket sat on a console just inside the door, holding a bottle of wine and two glasses tied with ribbon.</p><p>As Gideon turned the deadbolt with a firm click, I plucked the Welcome envelope out and opened it.</p><p>A key fell into my palm.</p><p>\"We won't be needing that.\"</p><p>He took the key from me and set it on the console.</p><p>\"For the next two days, we're going to be hermits together.\"</p><p>A hum of pleasure warmed me from the inside, followed by more than a little awe that a man like Gideon Cross could enjoy my company so much he didn't need anyone else.</p><p>\"Come on,\" he said, tugging me toward the stairs.</p><p>\"We'll break into that wine later.\"</p><p>\"Yeah.</p><p>Coffee first.\"</p><p>I took in the decor of the house.</p><p>It was rustic on the outside and modern contemporary on the inside.</p><p>The wainscoted walls were painted a bright white and decorated with massive black-and-white photos of seashells.</p><p>The furniture was all white, and most of the accessory pieces were glass and metal.</p><p>It would have been stark if not for the gorgeous view of the ocean and the color introduced in the area rugs covering the hardwood floors and the collection of hardcover books filling built-in bookcases.</p><p>When we reached the top floor, I felt a flutter of happiness.</p><p>The master suite was a totally open space, with only two support columns to break it up.</p><p>Bouquets of white roses, white tulips, and white calla lilies covered nearly every flat surface, and some even sat on the floor in strategic areas.</p><p>The bed was massive and covered in white satin, which made me think of a bridal suite, an impression reinforced by the black-and-white photo of a filmy scarf or veil blowing in the breeze hanging over the headboard.</p><p>I looked at Gideon.</p><p>\"Have you been here before?\" He reached up and freed my now- lopsided ponytail.</p><p>\"No.</p><p>What reason would I have to come here?\" Right.</p><p>He didn't take women anywhere but his hotel fuck pad - that he apparently still had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE

cry.</p><p>My hand shook as I ran a wide-toothed comb through my damp hair.</p><p>The bathroom had been stocked with my usual toiletries, demonstrating once again how thoughtful and attentive Gideon was, which only emphasized my deficits.</p> <p>I was making his life hell.</p><p>After all he'd already suffered, my issues were the last thing he needed to deal with.</p><p>I took the stairs down to the first floor and found myself unable to join Gideon in the kitchen.</p><p>I needed a minute to pull myself together and put on a happy face.</p><p>I didn't want to ruin the weekend for him, too.</p><p>I stepped out through the French doors that led to the deck.</p><p>The roar of the surf and the biting salt spray hit me at once.</p><p>The hem of my robe whipped gently in the ocean breeze, cooling me in a way I found invigorating.</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, I gripped the railing and closed my eyes, trying to find the peace I needed to keep Gideon from worrying.</p><p>My problem was me, and I didn't want to concern him with something he couldn't change.</p><p>Only I could make myself a stronger person, and I needed to, if I wanted to make him happy and offer him the security he so desperately wanted from me.</p><p>The door opened behind me, and I took a deep breath before turning to face him with a smile.</p><p>Gideon came out with two steaming mugs gripped in one hand - one filled with black coffee and the other lightened with half-and- half.</p><p>I knew it would be made perfectly to my tastes and delicious, because Gideon knew exactly what I liked.</p><p>Not because I'd told him, but because he paid attention to everything about me.</p><p>\"Stop beating yourself up,\" he ordered sternly, setting the mugs on the railing.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>Of course I couldn't hide my mood from him with just a smile.</p><p>He saw right through me.</p><p>He caught my face in his hands and glared down at me.</p><p>\"It's over and done with.</p><p>Forget it.\"</p><p>I reached out and ran my fingertips over the place where I'd seen the bruise.</p><p>\"It needed to happen,\" he said curtly.</p><p>\"No.</p><p>Shut up and listen to me.</p><p>I thought I understood your feelings about Corinne, and, frankly, I thought you just weren't dealing with it well.</p><p>But I had no clue.</p><p>I was a self-centered idiot.\"</p><p>\"I'm not dealing with it well.</p><p>I hate her fucking guts.</p><p>I can't think about her without feeling violent.\"</p><p>\"I get it now.</p><p>I didn't before.\"</p><p>His mouth twisted ruefully.</p><p>\"Sometimes it takes something drastic to shake me up.</p><p>Luckily, you've always been very good at getting my attention.\"</p><p>\"Don't try to tease this away, Gideon.</p><p>You could've been seriously hurt because of me.\"</p><p>He caught me by the waist when I would've turned away.</p><p>\"I was seriously hurt because of you.</p><p>Seeing you in another guy's arms, kissing him .\"</p><p>His eyes grew hot and dark.</p><p>\"It shredded me, Eva.</p><p>Cut me open and left me bleeding.</p><p>I kicked his ass in self-defense.\"</p><p>\"Oh, God,\" I breathed, devastated by his brutal honesty.</p><p>\"Gideon.\"</p><p>\"I'm disgusted with myself for not being more understanding about Corinne.</p><p>If a kiss could make me feel like that .\"</p><p>He wrapped his arms tight around me, one arm banding my hips while the other crossed my back so he could grip the back of my head.</p><p>Capturing me.</p><p>\"If you ever cheated on me,\" he said hoarsely, \"it would kill me.\"</p><p>Turning my head, I pressed my lips to his throat.</p><p>\"That stupid kiss meant nothing.</p><p>Less than nothing.\"</p><p>His hand gripped my hair and tilted my head back.</p><p>\"You don't understand what your kisses mean to me, Eva.</p><p>For you to just give one away and call it stupid - \" Gideon dipped his head and sealed his mouth over mine.</p><p>It started softly, sweet and teasing, his tongue stroking across my bottom lip.</p><p>I opened my mouth, my tongue flicking out to touch his.</p><p>He tilted his head and licked into my mouth.</p><p>Fast, shallow licks that stirred a simmering desire.</p><p>I reached up and slid my fingers into his damp hair, pushing up onto my tiptoes to deepen the kiss.</p><p>I moaned when he sucked on my tongue, leaning heavily against him.</p><p>His lips moved against mine, growing wetter and hotter.</p><p>We ate at each other, growing wilder by the second until we were fucking each other's mouths, passionately mating with lips and tongues and tiny bites.</p><p>I was panting with my hunger for him, my lips slanting over his, needy sounds spilling from my throat.</p><p>His kisses were gifts.</p><p>He kissed with everything he had, with power and passion and hunger and love.</p><p>He held nothing back, giving everything, exposing everything.</p><p>Tension gripped his powerful frame, his rough satin skin growing feverishly hot.</p><p>His tongue was plunging into my mouth, tangling with mine, his quickened breaths mingling with my own and filling my lungs.</p><p>My senses were drenched in him, in his flavor and scent, my mind spinning as I angled my head, seeking a deeper taste.</p><p>Wanting to lick deeper, suck harder.</p><p>Devour.</p><p>I wanted him so much.</p><p>His hands ran up and down my spine, trembling and restless.</p><p>He groaned and my sex tightened in answer.</p><p>Tugging at the belt of my robe, he loosened it, spreading open the halves to grip my bare hips in his hands.</p><p>He tugged on my lower lip, sinking his teeth into it, his tongue caressing it.</p><p>I whimpered, wanting more, my mouth feeling swollen and sensitive.</p><p>No matter how close we were, it was never close enough.</p><p>Gideon gripped both cheeks of my ass and pulled me up hard against him, his erection like hot steel burning my belly through the thin silk of his pants.</p><p>He released my lip and took my mouth again, filling me with the taste of his desire and need, his tongue a velvet lash of tormenting pleasure.</p><p>A hard shudder shook him and he growled, his hips circling.</p><p>His fingers bit into my rear and his groan vibrated against my lips.</p><p>I felt his cock jerk between us, then scorching warmth spread over my skin.</p><p>He came with a tormented groan, soaking the silk between us.</p><p>I cried out, melting and aching, so insanely aroused by the knowledge that I could make him lose control with just a kiss.</p><p>His grip loosened, his lungs heaving.</p><p>\"Your kisses are mine.\"</p><p>\"Yes.</p><p>Gideon .\"</p><p>I was shaken, left emotionally raw and open by the most erotic moment of my life.</p><p>He sank to his knees and tongued me to a shattering climax.</p><p>We showered and napped the morning away.</p><p>It felt so good to sleep beside him again, with my head pillowed on his chest, my arm draped over his rock- hard stomach, and my legs tangled with his.When we woke shortly after one in the afternoon, I was starving.</p><p>We headed down to the kitchen together and I found that I liked the ultra-stark modern look in that space.</p><p>The watered-glass cabinet doors and granite paired beautifully with the dark hardwood.</p><p>Better yet, the pantry was fully stocked.</p><p>There was no need to leave the house for anything.</p><p>We went the easy route and made sandwiches, which we took into the living room and ate cross-legged on the couch facing each other.</p><p>I was halfway through when I caught Gideon watching me with a grin.\"What?\" I asked, around a bite.</p><p>\"Arnoldo's right.</p><p>It's fun watching you eat.\"</p><p>\"Shut up.\"</p><p>His grin widened.</p><p>He looked so carefree and happy it made my heart hurt.\"How did you find this place?\" I asked him.</p><p>\"Or how did Scott find it?\" \"I found it.\"</p><p>He shoved a potato chip in his mouth and licked the salt from his lips,

while he's going through this.\"</p><p>\"I'm glad to hear that.\"</p><p>I linked my arm with his and led him to Cary's room.</p><p>We entered to the sound of my mother's trilling, girlish laughter.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed, with Cary smiling adoringly at her.</p><p>She was as much a mother to him as she was to me, and he loved her so much for that.</p><p>His own mother had hated him, abused him, and allowed others to abuse him.</p><p>He looked over and saw us, and the emotions that swept across his face in that moment caused a tightness in my chest.</p><p>I heard Trey's breath catch as he got his first sight of Cary's condition.</p><p>I kicked myself for not telling him in advance not to make the mistake of getting weepy like I had.</p><p>Trey cleared his throat.</p><p>\"Drama queen,\" he said with gruff affection.</p><p>\"If you wanted flowers, you should've just asked for them.</p><p>This is extreme.\"</p><p>\"And ineffective, apparently,\" Cary rejoined hoarsely, clearly trying to pull himself together.</p><p>\"I don't see any flowers.\"</p><p>\"I see a ton.\"</p><p>Trey's gaze did a brief slide across the room, then went back to Cary.</p><p>\"Just wanted to see what I was up against, so I could beat out my competition.\"</p><p>There was no way to miss the double meaning in that statement.</p><p>My mom rose from the bed.</p><p>She leaned over and kissed Cary's cheek.</p><p>\"I'll take Eva out to breakfast.</p><p>We'll see you in about an hour or so.\"</p><p>\"Gimme a sec,\" I said, passing the bed quickly, \"and I'll get out of your hair, guys.\"</p><p>I grabbed my phone and charger out of my bag and plugged it into an outlet by the window.</p><p>As soon as the screen flickered to life, I sent a quick group text message to Shawna and my dad, saying simply: I'll call later.</p><p>Then I made sure my phone was silenced and left it on the window ledge.</p><p>\"Ready?\" my mom asked.</p><p>\"As I'll ever be.\"</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>I had to get up before dawn Tuesday morning.</p><p>I left a note for Cary where he'd see it as soon as he woke up, then headed out to grab a cab back to our place.</p><p>I showered, dressed, made coffee, and tried to talk myself out of feeling like something was off.</p><p>I was stressed and suffering from lack of sleep, which always led to tiny bouts of depression.</p><p>I told myself that it had nothing to do with Gideon, but the knot in my stomach said differently.</p><p>Looking at the clock, I saw it was a little after eight.</p><p>I'd have to leave soon, because Gideon hadn't called or texted to say that he'd be giving me a ride.</p><p>It had been almost twenty-four hours since I'd last seen him or even really talked to him.</p><p>The call I'd made to him at nine the night before had been less than brief.</p><p>He'd been in the middle of something and barely said hello and good-bye.</p><p>I knew he had a lot of work to do.</p><p>I knew I shouldn't resent him for having to pay for the time away with extra hours of work getting caught up.</p><p>He'd done a lot to help me deal with Cary's situation, more than anyone could've expected.</p><p>It was up to me to deal with how I was feeling about it.</p><p>Finishing my coffee, I rinsed out my mug, then grabbed my purse and bag on the way out.</p><p>My tree-lined street was quiet, but the rest of New York was wide awake, its ceaseless energy thrumming with a tangible force.</p><p>Women in chic office wear and men in suits tried to hail taxis that streaked by, before settling for packed buses or the subway instead.</p><p>Flower stands exploded with brilliant color, the sight of them always capable of cheering me up in the morning, as did the sight and smell of the neighborhood bakery, which was doing a brisk business at that hour.</p><p>I was a little ways down Broadway before my phone rang.</p><p>The little thrill that shot through me at the sight of Gideon's name quickened my steps.</p><p>\"Hey, stranger.\"</p><p>\"Where the hell are you?\" he snapped.</p><p>A frisson of unease dampened my excitement.</p><p>\"I'm on my way to work.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" He spoke to someone offline, then, \"Are you in a cab?\" \"I'm walking.</p><p>Jeez.</p><p>Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed or what?\" \"You should have waited to be picked up.\"</p><p>\"I didn't hear from you, and I didn't want to be late after missing work yesterday.\"</p><p>\"You could've called me instead of just taking off.\"</p><p>His voice was low and angry.</p><p>I became angry, too.</p><p>\"The last time I called, you were too busy to give me more than a minute of your time.\"</p><p>\"I've got things to take care of, Eva.</p><p>Give me a break.\"</p><p>\"Sure thing.</p><p>How about now?\" I hung up and dropped my phone back into my bag.</p><p>It began ringing again immediately and I ignored it, my blood simmering.</p><p>When the Bentley pulled up beside me a few minutes later, I kept walking.</p><p>It followed, the front passenger window sliding down.</p><p>Angus leaned over.</p><p>\"Miss Tramell, please.\"</p><p>I paused, looking at him.</p><p>\"Are you alone?\" \"Yes.\"</p><p>With a sigh, I got in the car.</p><p>My phone was still ringing nonstop, so I reached in and shut the ringer off.</p><p>One block later, I heard Gideon's voice coming through the car's speakers.</p><p>\"Do you have her?\" \"Yes, sir,\" Angus replied.</p><p>The line cut out.</p><p>\"What the hell crawled up his ass and died?\" I asked, looking at Angus in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\"He's got a lot on his mind.\"</p><p>Whatever it was, it sure wasn't me.</p><p>I couldn't believe what a jerk he was being.</p><p>He'd been curt on the phone the night before, too, but not rude.</p><p>Within a few minutes after I arrived at work, Mark came up to my cubicle.</p><p>\"I'm sorry to hear about your roommate,\" he said, setting a fresh cup of coffee on my desk.</p><p>\"Is he going to be all right?\" \"Eventually.</p><p>Cary's tough; he'll pull through.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta

checked my inbox.</p><p>The Google alert I'd set up for Gideon's name was waiting for me.</p><p>I opened the e-mail hoping to get an idea of what he might be working on.</p><p>The words former fiancee in some of the headlines leaped out at me.</p><p>The knot I'd had in my gut earlier returned, tighter than before.</p><p>I clicked on the first link, and it took me to a gossip blog sporting pictures of Gideon and Corinne having dinner at Tableau One.</p><p>They sat close together in the front window, her hand resting intimately on his forearm.</p><p>He was wearing the suit he'd worn to the hospital the day before, but I checked the date anyway, desperately hoping the photos were old.</p> <p>They weren't.</p><p>My palms began to sweat.</p><p>I tortured myself by clicking through all the links and studying every photo I found.</p><p>He was smiling in a few of them, looking remarkably content for a man whose girlfriend was at a hospital with her beaten-half-to-death best friend.</p><p>I felt like throwing up.</p><p>Or screaming.</p><p>Or storming up to Gideon's office and asking him what the hell was going on.</p><p>He'd blown me off when I'd called him the night before - to go to dinner with his ex.</p><p>I jumped when my desk phone rang.</p><p>I picked it up and woodenly recited, \"Mark Garrity's office, Eva Tramell speaking.\"</p><p>\"Eva.\"</p><p>It was Megumi in reception, sounding as bubbly as usual.</p><p>\"There's someone asking for you downstairs - Brett Kline.\"</p><p>I sat there for a long minute, letting that sink into my fevered brain.</p><p>I forwarded the alert digest to Gideon's e-mail so he'd know that I knew.</p><p>Then I said, \"I'll be right down.\"</p><p>* * I saw Brett in the lobby the minute I pushed through the security turnstiles.</p><p>He wore black jeans and a Six-Ninths T-shirt.</p><p>Sunglasses hid his eyes, but the spiky hair with its bleached tips was eye-catching, as was his body.</p><p>Brett was tall and muscular, more muscular than Gideon, who was powerful without any bulk.</p><p>Brett's hands came out of his pockets when he saw me coming, his posture straightening.</p><p>\"Hey.</p><p>Look at you.\"</p><p>I glanced down at my cap-sleeved dress with its flattering ruching and acknowledged that he'd never seen me dressed up.</p><p>\"I'm surprised you're still in town.\"</p><p>More surprised that he'd looked me up, but I didn't say that.</p><p>I was glad he had, because I'd been worried about him.</p><p>\"We sold out our Jones Beach show over the weekend, then played the Meadowlands last night.</p><p>I skipped out on the guys because I wanted to see you before we head south.</p><p>I searched for you online, found out where you worked, and came up.\"</p><p>Good old Google, I thought miserably.</p><p>\"I'm so stoked that everything's working out for you now.</p><p>Do you have time to grab lunch?\" \"Yes.\"</p><p>His answer came quickly and fervently, which set off a little warning.</p><p>I was pissed, extremely hurt, and eager to retaliate against Gideon, but I didn't want to mislead Brett.</p><p>Still, I couldn't resist taking him to the restaurant where Cary and I had once been photographed together, in the hopes of getting caught by the paparazzi again.</p><p>It would serve Gideon right to see what it felt like.</p><p>On the cab ride over, Brett asked about Cary and wasn't surprised to learn that my best friend had moved across the country with me.</p><p>\"You two were always inseparable,\" he said.</p><p>\"Except when he was getting laid.</p><p>Tell him I said hi.\"</p><p>\"Sure.\"</p><p>I didn't mention that Cary was in the hospital, because it felt too private to share.</p><p>It wasn't until we were seated in the restaurant that Brett took off his shades, so that was the first time I got a glimpse of the shiner that encompassed the area from his right eyebrow down to his cheekbone.</p><p>\"Jesus,\" I breathed, wincing.</p><p>\"I'm sorry.\"</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\"Makeup made it disappear on stage.</p><p>And you've seen me with worse.</p><p>Besides, I got a couple good hits in, didn't I?\" Remembering the bruising on Gideon's jaw and back, I nodded.</p><p>\"You did.\"</p><p>\"So .\"</p><p>He paused as the waiter came by and dropped off two glasses and a chilled bottle of water.</p><p>\"You're dating Gideon Cross.\"</p><p>I wondered why that question always seemed to pop up at a time when I wasn't sure the relationship would last another minute.</p><p>\"We've been seeing each other.\"</p><p>\"Is it serious?\" \"Sometimes it seems that way,\" I said honestly.</p><p>\"Are you seeing anyone?\" \"Not now.\"</p><p>We took some time to read the menu and place our orders.</p><p>The restaurant was busy and noisy, the background music barely heard over the hum of conversation and clatter of plates from the nearby kitchen.</p><p>We looked across the table at each other, sizing one another up.</p><p>I felt the thrum of attraction between us.</p><p>When he wet his lips with the tip of his tongue, I knew he was aware of it, too.</p><p>\"Why did you write 'Golden'?\" I asked suddenly, unable to hold back my curiosity a moment longer.</p><p>I'd been playing it off as nothing big with both Gideon and Cary, but it was driving me crazy.</p><p>Brett sat back in his chair.</p><p>\"Because I think about you a lot.</p><p>I can't stop thinking about you actually.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand why.\"</p><p>\"We had it going on for six months, Eva.</p><p>That's the longest I've ever been with someone.\"</p><p>\"But we weren't with each other,\" I argued.</p><p>My voice lowered.</p><p>\"Aside from sexually.\"</p><p>His mouth thinned.</p><p>\"I understand what I was to you, but that doesn't mean I didn't get hurt.\"</p><p>I stared at him for a long minute, my heart beating too quickly in my chest.</p><p>\"I feel like I'm stoned or something.</p><p>The way I remember it, we'd hook up after shows, then you'd go about your business.</p><p>And if I wasn't there to put out, you'd grab someone else.\"</p><p>He leaned forward.</p><p>\"Bullshit.</p><p>I tried getting you to hang out.</p><p>I was always asking you to stick around.\"</p><p>I took a couple of quick, deep breaths to calm myself down.</p><p>I could hardly believe that now, almost four years too late, Brett Kline was talking to me like I'd once wanted him to.</p><p>We were out in public together, having a meal, almost like a date.</p><p>It was messing with my head, which was already confused and scattered because of Gideon.</p><p>\"I had the biggest crush on you, Brett.</p><p>I wrote your name with little hearts around it like a lovesick teenager.</p><p>I wanted desperately to be your girlfriend.\"</p><p>\"Are you kidding me?\" He reached out and caught my hand.</p><p>\"What the fuck happened, then?\" I looked down at where he was absently twirling the ring Gideon had given me.</p><p>\"Remember when we went to the pool hall?\" \"Yeah.</p><p>How could I forget that?\" He bit his lower lip, clearly recalling how I'd fucked his brains out in the back of his car, determined to be the best lay he'd ever had so he wouldn't bother with other girls.</p><p>\"I thought we were getting to the point where we'd start seeing each other outside the bar, but you ditched me the minute we got inside.\"</p><p>\"I went to the bathroom,\" I said quietly, remembering the pain and embarrassment as if the incident had just happened, \"and when I came out you and Darrin were at the change machine getting quarters for the tables.</p><p>Your back was to me so you didn't see me.</p><p>I heard you guys talking .</p><p>and laughing.\"</p><p>I pulled in a deep breath and tugged my hand away from him.</p><p>To his credit, Brett shifted in obvious embarrassment.</p><p>\"I can't remember exactly what was said, but .</p><p>Shit, Eva.</p><p>I was twenty-one years old.</p><p>The band was just starting to get popular.</p><p>The chicks were everywhere.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I said dryly.</p><p>\"I was one of them.\"</p><p>\"I'd been with you a few times by then.</p><p>Bringing you along to the pool hall made a statement to the guys that things were picking up between us.\"</p><p>He rubbed at his brow in a very familiar gesture.</p><p>\"I didn't have the balls to own up to how I was feeling about you.</p><p>I made it about the sex, but that wasn't true.\"</p><p>I lifted my glass and drank, forcing down the lump in my throat.</p><p>His hand dropped onto the armrest.</p><p>\"So I screwed it up with my big mouth.</p><p>That's why you bailed that night.</p><p>That's why you never went anywhere with me again.\"</p><p>\"I was desperate, Brett,\" I admitted, \"but I didn't want to show it.\"</p><p>The waiter brought our food.</p><p>I wondered why I'd ordered anything - I was too unsettled to eat.</p><p>Brett started cutting into his steak, attacking it really.</p><p>Suddenly, he set his knife and fork down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1,

happy.</p><p>Trey's visit must have worked wonders.</p><p>Angus dropped me off at the curb in front of the Crossfire, and I hurried out of the heat into the cool lobby.</p><p>I managed to catch an open elevator just before the doors closed.</p><p>There were a half dozen other people in the car with me, forming two groups that chatted among themselves.</p><p>I stood in the front corner and tried to put my personal life out of my mind.</p><p>I couldn't deal with it at work.</p><p>\"Hey, we passed our floor,\" the girl next to me said.</p><p>I looked at the needle over the door.</p><p>The guy nearest the control panel stabbed repeatedly at all the numbers, but none of them lit up .</p><p>except for the one for the top floor.</p><p>\"The buttons aren't working.\"</p><p>My pulse quickened.</p><p>\"Use the emergency phone,\" one of the other girls said.</p><p>The car raced up and the butterflies in my stomach got worse with every floor we passed.</p><p>The elevator finally came to a gliding stop at the top and the doors opened.</p><p>Gideon stood on the threshold, his face a gorgeous impassive mask.</p><p>His eyes were brilliantly blue .</p><p>and cold as ice.</p><p>The sight of him took my breath away.</p><p>No one in the car said a word.</p><p>I didn't move, praying the doors would hurry up and close.</p><p>Gideon reached in, grabbed my elbow, and hauled me out.</p><p>I struggled, too furious to want anything to do with him.</p><p>The doors closed behind me and he let me go.</p><p>\"Your behavior today has been appalling,\" he growled.</p><p>\"My behavior? What about yours?\" I crossed over to the call buttons and hit the down button.</p><p>It wouldn't stay lit.</p><p>\"I'm talking to you, Eva.\"</p><p>I glanced at the security doors to Cross Industries and was relieved to see that the redheaded receptionist was away from her station.</p><p>\"Really?\" I faced him, hating that I could still find him so irresistibly attractive when he was being so ugly.</p><p>\"Funny how that doesn't lead to me actually learning anything - like about you going out with Corinne last night.\"</p><p>\"You shouldn't be snooping online about me,\" he bit out.</p><p>\"You're deliberately trying to find something to get upset about.\"</p><p>\"So your actions aren't the problem?\" I shot back, feeling the pressure of tears at the back of my throat.</p><p>\"Just my finding out about them is?\"His arms crossed.</p><p>\"You need to trust me, Eva.\"</p><p>\"You're making that impossible! Why didn't you tell me that you were going out to dinner with Corinne?\" \"Because I knew you wouldn't like it.\"</p><p>\"But you did it anyway.\"</p><p>And that hurt.</p><p>After all we'd talked about over the weekend .</p><p>after he'd said that he understood how I felt .</p><p>\"And you went out with Brett Kline knowing I wouldn't like it.\"</p><p>\"What did I tell you? You're setting the precedent for how I handle my exes.\"</p><p>\"Tit for tat? What a remarkable show of maturity.\"</p><p>I stumbled back from him.</p><p>There was none of the Gideon I knew in the man facing me.</p><p>It felt as if the man I loved had disappeared and the man standing in front of me was a total stranger in Gideon's body.</p><p>\"You're making me hate you,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Stop it.\"</p><p>Something passed briefly over Gideon's face, but it was gone before I could identify it.</p><p>I let his body language do the talking for him.</p><p>He stood far from me, with his shoulders stiff and his jaw tight.</p><p>My heart bled and my gaze dropped.</p><p>\"I can't be around you right now.</p><p>Let me go.\"</p><p>Gideon moved to the other bank of elevators and pushed the call button.</p><p>With his back to me and his attention on the indicator arrow, he said, \"Angus will pick you up every morning.</p><p>Wait for him.</p><p>And I prefer that you eat lunch at your desk.</p><p>It's best if you're not running around right now.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" \"I have a lot of things on my plate at the moment - \" \"Like dinner with Corinne?\" \" - and I can't be worrying about you,\" he went on, ignoring my interruption.</p><p>\"I don't think I'm asking too much.\"</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>\"Gideon, why won't you talk to me?\" I reached out and touched his shoulder, only to have him jerk away as if I'd burned him.</p><p>More than anything else, his rejection of my touch wounded me deeply.</p><p>\"Tell me what's going on.</p><p>If there's a problem - \" \"The problem is that I don't know where the hell you are half the time!\" he snapped, turning to scowl at me as the elevator doors opened.</p><p>\"Your roommate is in the hospital.</p><p>Your dad is coming to visit.</p><p>Just .</p><p>focus on that.\"</p><p>I stepped into the elevator with burning eyes.</p><p>Aside from pulling me out of the elevator when it first arrived, Gideon hadn't touched me.</p><p>He hadn't run his fingertips down my cheek or made any attempt to kiss me.</p><p>And he made no mention of wanting to see me later, skipping right over the rest of the day to tell me about Angus waiting for me in the morning.</p><p>I'd never been so confused.</p><p>I couldn't figure out what was happening, why there was suddenly this huge gulf between us, why Gideon was so tense and angry, why he didn't seem to care that I'd had lunch with Brett.</p><p>Why he didn't seem to care about anything at all.</p><p>The doors started to close.</p><p>Trust me, Eva. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had he breathed those words in the second before the doors shut?

knowing smile.</p><p>\"You've experienced what I'm talking about.</p><p>He's going to continue to play with you until you rely on his mood to gauge your own.</p><p>Then he'll get bored and dump you.\"</p><p>\"What happened between you?\" I asked again, knowing that was key.</p><p>\"Gideon Cross is a narcissistic sociopath,\" he went on as if I hadn't spoken.</p><p>\"I believe he's a misogynist.</p><p>He uses his money to seduce women, then despises them for being shallow enough to find his wealth attractive.</p><p>He uses sex to control, and you never know what sort of mood you'll find him in.</p><p>That's part of the rush - when you're always steeling yourself for the worst, you psych yourself up for a surge of relief when he's at his best.\"</p><p>\"You don't know him,\" I said smoothly, refusing to take the bait.</p><p>\"And neither does your wife.\"</p><p>\"Neither do you.\"</p><p>He sat back and drank his coffee, appearing as unruffled as I tried to be.</p><p>\"No one does.</p><p>He's a master manipulator and liar.</p><p>Don't underestimate him.</p><p>He's a twisted, dangerous man capable of just about anything.\"</p><p>\"The fact that you won't explain his grudge against you makes me think you're at fault.\"</p><p>\"You shouldn't make assumptions.</p><p>There are some things I'm not at liberty to discuss.\"</p><p>\"That's convenient.\"</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>\"I'm not your adversary, Eva, and Cross doesn't need anyone to fight his battles.</p><p>You don't have to believe me.</p><p>Frankly, I'm so bitter I wouldn't believe me if I were in your place.</p><p>But you're a beautiful, smart young lady.\"</p><p>I hadn't been lately, but it was my responsibility to fix that.</p><p>Or walk.</p><p>\"If you take a step back,\" he continued, \"and look at what he's doing to you, how you're feeling about yourself since you've been with him, and whether you're truly fulfilled by your relationship, you'll come to your own conclusions.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\"

away.</p><p>I'm glad.\"</p><p>I watched him walk briskly out of the cafeteria and collapsed into the seat back the moment he disappeared from view, deflating from exhaustion and confusion.</p><p>My gaze moved to the sleeping screen of my tablet.</p><p>I didn't have the energy to finish my letter.</p> <p>I packed up and went to get ready for Angus's arrival.</p><p>\"You up for Chinese?\" I looked up from the layout of the blueberry coffee ad on my desk into the warm brown eyes of my boss.</p><p>I realized it was Wednesday, our usual day to go eat with Steven.</p><p>For a second, I considered bowing out and eating at my desk because I wanted to make Gideon happy.</p><p>But just as quickly, I knew I'd resent him if I did.</p><p>I was still trying to build a new life in New York, which included making friends and having plans that existed outside the life I shared with him.</p> <p>\"Always up for Chinese,\" I said.</p><p>My very first meal with Mark and Steven had been Chinese takeout here in the office, on a night when we'd worked well past closing and Steven had stopped by to feed us.</p><p>Mark and I headed out at noon, and I refused to feel guilty about something I enjoyed so much.</p><p>Steven was waiting for us at the restaurant, seated at a round table with a lacquered lazy Susan in the middle.</p><p>\"Hey, you.\"</p><p>He greeted me with a big bear hug, then pulled a chair out for me.</p><p>He studied me as we both sat down.</p><p>\"You look tired.\"</p> <p>I guessed I must really look like shit, since everyone kept telling me that.</p><p>\"It's been a rough week so far.\"</p><p>The waitress came by and Steven ordered a dim sum appetizer and the same dishes we'd shared for that first late-evening meal - kung pao chicken and broccoli beef.</p><p>When we were alone again, Steven said, \"I didn't know your roommate was gay.</p><p>Did you tell us that?\" \"He's bi, actually.\"</p><p>I realized Steven, or someone he knew, must have seen the same newspaper Cary had showed me.</p><p>\"I don't think it came up.\"</p><p>\"How's he feeling?\" Mark asked, looking genuinely concerned.</p><p>\"Better.</p><p>He might be coming home today.\"</p><p>Which was something that had been weighing on me all morning, since Gideon hadn't called to tell me definitively one way or the other.</p><p>\"Let us know if you need any help,\" Steven said, all traces of levity gone.</p><p>\"We're here for you.\"</p><p>\"Thank you.</p><p>It wasn't a hate crime,\" I clarified.</p><p>\"I don't know where the reporter got that.</p><p>I used to respect journalists.</p><p>Now, so few of them do their homework, and fewer still can write objectively.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure it's tough living in the media spotlight.\"</p><p>Steven squeezed my hand on the table.</p><p>He was a gregarious, playful fellow, but beneath that fun exterior was a solid man with a kind heart.</p><p>\"But then you have to kinda expect it when you're juggling rock stars and billionaires.\"</p><p>\"Steven,\" Mark scolded, frowning.</p><p>\"Ugh.\"</p><p>My nose wrinkled.</p><p>\"Shawna told you.\"</p><p>\"Of course she did,\" Steven said.</p><p>\"Least she can do after not inviting me along to the concert.</p><p>But don't worry.</p><p>She's not a gossip.</p><p>She won't be telling anyone else.\"</p><p>I nodded, having no anxiety about that.</p><p>Shawna was good people, but it was still embarrassing having my boss know I'd kissed one man while dating another.</p><p>\"Not that it would be a bad thing for Cross to get a taste of his own medicine,\" Steven muttered.</p><p>I frowned, confused.</p><p>Then I caught Mark's sympathetic gaze.</p><p>I realized the gay newspaper wasn't the only news they'd seen.</p><p>They must have seen the photos of Gideon and Corinne, too.</p><p>I felt my face flush with humiliation.</p><p>\"He'll get a taste,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"If I have to cram it down his throat.\"</p><p>Steven's brows shot up, and then he laughed and patted my hand.</p><p>\"Get him, girl.\"</p><p>I'd barely returned to my desk when my work phone rang.</p><p>\"Mark Garrity's office, Eva - \" \"Why is it so damn difficult for you to follow orders?\" Gideon asked harshly.</p><p>I just sat there, staring at the collage of photos he'd given me, pictures of us looking connected and in love.\"Eva?\" \"What do you want from me, Gideon?\" I asked quietly.</p><p>There was a moment of silence, then he exhaled.</p><p>\"Cary will be moved to your apartment this afternoon under the supervision of his doctor and a private nurse.</p><p>He should be there when you get home.\"</p><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><p>Another stretch of quiet filled the line between us, but he didn't hang up.</p><p>Finally, I queried, \"Are we done?\" The question had a double meaning.</p><p>I wondered if he caught that or even cared.</p><p>\"Angus will give you a ride home.\"</p><p>My grip tightened on the phone.</p><p>\"Good-bye, Gideon.\"</p><p>I hung up and got back to work.</p><p>I checked on Cary the minute I got home.</p><p>His bed had been moved aside and propped vertically against the wall to make room for a hospital bed that he could adjust at will.</p><p>He was asleep when I came in, his nurse sitting in a new recliner and reading an e-book.</p><p>It was the same nurse I'd seen the first night in the hospital, the pretty and exotic-looking one who had trouble taking her eyes off Gideon.</p><p>I wondered when he'd spoken to her - if he'd done it himself or sent someone else to do it - and whether she'd agreed for the money or for Gideon or both.</p><p>The fact that I was too tired to care one way or another said a lot about my own disconnection.</p><p>Maybe there were people out there whose love could survive anything, but mine was fragile.</p><p>It needed to be nurtured in order to thrive and grow.</p><p>I took a long, hot shower, then crawled into bed.</p><p>I pulled my tablet onto my lap and tried to continue my letter to Gideon.</p><p>I wanted to express my thoughts and reservations in a mature and cogent way.</p><p>I wanted to make it easy for him to understand my reactions to some of the things he did and said, so he could see things from my point of view.</p><p>In the end, I didn't have the energy.</p><p>I'm not elaborating any more, I wrote instead, because if I keep going, I'll beg.</p><p>And if you don't know me well enough to know that you're hurting me, a letter isn't going to fix our problems.</p><p>I'm desperate for you.</p><p>I'm miserable without you.</p><p>I think about the weekend, and the hours we spent together, and I can't think of anything I wouldn't do to have you like that again.</p><p>Instead, you're spending time with HER, while I'm alone on my fourth night without you.</p><p>Even knowing you've been with her, I want to crawl on my knees for you and beg for scraps.</p><p>A touch.</p><p>A kiss.</p><p>One tender word.</p><p>You've made me that weak.</p><p>I hate myself like this.</p><p>I hate that I need you this much.</p><p>I hate that I'm so obsessed with you.</p><p>I hate that I love you.</p><p>Eva I attached it to an e-mail with the subject line My thoughts - uncensored and hit send.</p><p>\"Don't be afraid.\"</p><p>I woke to those three words and utter darkness.</p><p>The mattress dipped as Gideon sat beside me, leaning over me with his arms bracketing my body and the blankets between us, a cocoon and barrier that allowed my mind to wake without fear.</p><p>The delicious and unmistakable fragrance of his soap and shampoo mixed with the scent of his skin, soothing me along with his voice.</p><p>\"Angel.\"</p><p>He took my mouth, his lips slanting over mine.</p><p>I touched his chest with my fingers, feeling bare skin.</p><p>He groaned and stood, bending over me so his mouth stayed connected to mine while he yanked the blankets off and away.</p><p>Then he was settling over me, his body nude and hot to the touch.</p><p>His ardent mouth moved down my throat, his hands pushing up my camisole so he could get to my breasts.</p><p>His lips surrounded my nipple and he suckled, his weight supported by one forearm on the mattress, his other hand pushing between my legs.</p><p>He cupped my sex, his fingertip gliding over the satin along the seam of my cleft.</p><p>His tongue flickered over my nipple, making it hard and tight, his teeth sinking lightly into the taut flesh.</p><p>\"Gideon!\" Tears slid in rivulets down my temples, the protective numbness I'd felt earlier falling away, leaving me exposed.</p><p>I'd been withering without him, the world around me losing its vibrancy, my body hurting from its separation from his.</p><p>Having him with me .</p><p>touching me .</p><p>was like rain in a drought.</p><p>My soul unfurled for him, opening wide to soak him in.</p><p>I loved him so much.</p><p>His hair tickled my skin as his open mouth slid over my cleavage, his chest expanding as he breathed me in, nuzzling and wallowing in my scent.</p><p>He captured the tip of my other breast with hard, deep suction.</p><p>The pleasure shot through me, echoing in the clenching of my sex against his teasing fingertip.</p><p>He moved down my torso, licking and nibbling a path across my stomach, the breadth of his shoulders forcing my legs wider until his hot breath gusted over my slick cleft.</p><p>His nose pressed against the wet satin, stroking me.</p><p>He inhaled with a groan.</p><p>\"Eva.</p><p>I've been starved for you.\"</p><p>With impatient fingers, Gideon shoved the crotch of my panties aside and his mouth was on me.</p><p>He held me open with his thumbs, his tongue lashing over my throbbing clit.</p><p>My back arched with a cry, all my senses painfully acute without the benefit of sight.</p><p>Tilting his head, he thrust into the quivering opening of my sex, fucking rhythmically, teasing me with shallow plunges. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html

eating me with an intensity I was helpless against.</p><p>The flesh between my legs was so swollen and sensitive, so vulnerable to his ravenous hunger.</p><p>I was climaxing again within moments, my nails scouring the sheets.</p><p>My eyes were opened and blinded by darkness when he ripped my underwear off me and crawled over me.</p><p>I felt the wide crest of his cock notch into my cleft, and

his.</p><p>He gripped my hips, elevating them, tilting me to the angle he wanted.</p><p>He rolled his hips, stirring his cock inside me, pulling me onto him until I gasped in pain at how deep he was.</p><p>The lips of my sex clung to the very base of his penis, spread wide to encompass the thick root.</p><p>I had all of him, every inch, crammed too full and loving it.</p><p>I'd been empty for days, so lonely I ached.</p><p>He groaned my name and came, spurting hot and thick, the creamy heat spreading upward along his length because there was no room inside me.</p><p>He shuddered violently,

my headboard, my damp face pressed into my pillow.</p><p>I waited for him to push into me and shivered when I felt his breath against my buttocks.</p> <p>Then I jerked violently at the feel of him licking along the seam.</p><p>He rimmed me with the tip of his tongue, stimulating the puckered opening to my rear.</p><p>A broken sound escaped me.</p><p>I don't do anal play, Eva.</p><p>The tight ring of muscle flexed as I remembered his words, helplessly responding to the delicate flutters.</p><p>There was nothing in our bed but us.</p><p>Nothing could touch us when we were touching each other.</p><p>Gideon squeezed both of my cheeks in his hands, grounding me in the moment.</p><p>I was open and parted for him in every way, completely exposed to his lush dark kiss.</p><p>\"Oh!\" I tensed all over.</p><p>His tongue was inside me, thrusting.</p><p>My entire body began to quake from the feeling, my toes curling, my lungs heaving as he possessed me without shame or

skin feverish, my chest shaking with sobs I couldn't hold back.</p><p>He reached beneath me, pressed the flat of his fingers against my aching clit and rubbing, massaging.</p><p>His tongue was driving me insane.</p><p>The orgasm brewing inside me was spurred by the knowledge that there were no longer any boundaries for him with my body.</p><p>He would do anything he desired - possess it, use it, pleasure it.</p><p>Burying my face in my pillow, I screamed as I came, the ecstasy so vicious my legs gave out and I melted into the mattress.</p><p>Gideon slid over my back, his knee pushing my legs wide, his perspiration- slick body blanketing mine.</p><p>He mounted me, pushing his cock inside me, his fingers linking with mine and pinning my hands to the bed.</p><p>I was soaked with him and he rocked against me, sliding in and out.</p><p>\"I'm desperate for you,\" he said hoarsely.</p><p>\"I'm miserable without you.\"</p><p>I tensed.</p><p>\"Don't mock me.\"</p><p>\"I need you as

namely Brett.</p><p>As I walked home, I entertained thoughts of having Brett over for dinner instead, imagining Angus having to make that call to Gideon when Brett came strolling up to my place.</p><p>It was just a quick vengeful fantasy, since I wouldn't lead Brett on that way and he was in Florida anyway, but it did the trick.</p><p>My step lightened and when I entered my apartment, I was in my first really good mood in days.I dumped all the dinner stuff off in the kitchen, then went to find my dad.</p><p>He was hanging out in Cary's room playing a video game.</p><p>Cary worked a nunchuk one-handed, since his other hand was in a cast.</p><p>\"Woo!\" my dad shouted.</p><p>\"Spanked.\"</p><p>\"You should be ashamed of yourself,\" Cary shot back, \"taking advantage of an invalid.\"</p><p>\"I'm crying a river here.\"</p><p>Cary looked at me in the doorway and winked.</p><p>I loved him so much in that moment I couldn't stop myself from crossing over to him and pressing a kiss to his bruised forehead.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Thank me with dinner.</p><p>I'm starving.\"</p><p>I straightened.</p><p>\"I got the goods to make enchiladas.\"</p><p>My dad looked at me, smiling, knowing I'd need his help.</p><p>\"Yeah?\" \"When you're ready,\" I told him.</p><p>\"I'm going to grab a shower.\"</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, my dad and I were in the kitchen rolling cheese and store-bought rotisserie chicken - my little cheat to save time - into lard- soaked white corn tortillas.</p><p>In the living room, the CD changer slipped in the next disk and Van Morrison's soulful voice piped through the surround sound speakers.</p><p>\"Oh yeah,\" my dad said, reaching for my hand and tugging me away from the counter.</p><p>\"Hum-de-rum, hum-de- rum, moondance,\" he sang in his deep baritone, twirling me.</p><p>I laughed, delighted.</p><p>Using the back of his hand against my spine to keep his greasy fingers off me, he swept me into a dance around the island, both of us singing the song and laughing.</p><p>We were making our second revolution when I noticed the two people standing at the breakfast bar.</p><p>My smile fled and I stumbled, forcing my dad to catch me.</p><p>\"You got two left feet?\" he teased, his eyes only on me.</p><p>\"Eva's a wonderful dancer,\" Gideon interjected, his face arrested in that implacable mask I detested.</p><p>My dad turned, his smile fading, too.Gideon rounded the bar and entered the kitchen.</p><p>He'd dressed for the occasion in jeans and a Yankees T- shirt.</p><p>It was a suitably casual choice and a conversation starter, since my dad was a die-hard Padres fan.</p><p>\"I hadn't realized she was such a good singer, as well.</p><p>Gideon Cross,\" he introduced himself, holding out his hand.</p><p>\"Victor Reyes.\"</p><p>My dad waved his shiny fingers.</p><p>\"I'm a bit messy.\"</p><p>\"I don't mind.\"</p><p>Shrugging, my dad took his hand and sized him up.</p><p>I tossed the dish towel to the guys and made my way over to Ireland, who was positively glowing.</p><p>Her blue eyes were bright, her cheeks flushed with pleasure.</p><p>\"I'm so glad you could make it,\" I said, hugging her carefully.</p><p>\"You look gorgeous!\" \"So do you!\" It was a fib, but I appreciated it anyway.</p><p>I hadn't done anything to my face or hair after my shower, because I knew my dad wouldn't care and I hadn't expected Gideon to show up.</p><p>After all, the last time I'd heard from him had been when he'd said he would meet me at Dr.</p><p>Petersen's office.</p><p>She looked over at the counter where I'd dumped everything.</p><p>\"Can I help?\" \"Sure.</p><p>Just don't count calories in your head - it'll explode.\"</p><p>I introduced her to my dad, who was much warmer to her than he was to Gideon, and then I led her to the sink, where she washed up.</p><p>In short order, I had her helping to roll the last few enchiladas, while my dad put the already chilled Dos Equis Gideon had brought into the fridge.</p><p>I didn't even bother to wonder how Gideon knew I was serving Mexican food for dinner.</p><p>I only wondered why he'd invest the time to find out when it was very clear he other things to do - like ditch his appointments.</p><p>My dad went to his room to wash up.</p><p>Gideon came up behind me and put his hands on my waist, his lips brushing over my temple.</p><p>\"Eva.\"</p><p>I tensed against the nearly irresistible urge to lean into him.</p><p>\"Don't,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"I'd rather we didn't pretend.\"</p><p>His breath left him in a rush that ruffled my hair.</p><p>His fingers tightened on my hips, kneading for a moment.</p><p>Then I felt his phone vibrate and he released me, backing away to look at the screen.</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" he said gruffly, leaving the kitchen before answering.</p><p>Ireland sidled over and whispered, \"Thank you.</p><p>I know you made him bring me along.\"</p><p>I managed a smile for her.</p><p>\"Nobody can make Gideon do anything he doesn't want to.\"</p><p>\"You could.\"</p><p>She tossed her head, throwing her sleek waist-length black hair over her shoulder.</p><p>\"You didn't see him watching you dance with your dad.</p><p>His eyes got all shiny.</p><p>I thought he was going to cry.</p><p>And on the way up here, in the elevator, he tried to play it off, but I could totally tell he was nervous.\"</p><p>I stared down at the can of enchilada sauce in my hands, feeling my heart break a little more.</p><p>\"You're mad at him, aren't you?\" Ireland asked.</p><p>I cleared my throat.</p><p>\"Some people are just better off as friends.\"</p><p>\"But you said you love him.\"</p><p>\"That's not always enough.\"</p><p>I turned around to reach the can opener and found Gideon standing at the other end of the island, staring at me.</p><p>I froze.</p><p>A muscle in his jaw twitched before he unclenched it.</p><p>\"Would you like a beer?\" he asked gruffly.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>I could've used a shot, too.</p><p>Maybe a few.</p><p>\"Want a glass?\" \"No.\"</p><p>He looked at Ireland.</p><p>\"You thirsty? There's soda, water, milk.\"</p><p>\"How about one of those beers?\" she shot back, flashing a winsome smile.</p><p>\"Try again,\" he said wryly.</p><p>I watched Ireland, noting how she sparkled when Gideon focused on her.</p><p>I couldn't believe he didn't see how she loved him.</p><p>Maybe right now it was based on superficial things, but it was there and it would grow with a little encouragement.</p><p>I hoped he'd work on that.When Gideon handed me the chilled beer, his fingers brushed mine.</p><p>He held on for a minute, looking into my eyes.</p><p>I knew he was thinking about the other night.</p><p>It seemed like a dream now, as if his visit never really happened.</p><p>I could almost believe that I'd made it up in a desperate delusion, so hungry for his touch and his love that I couldn't go another minute without giving my mind relief from the madness of wanting and craving.</p><p>If it weren't for the lingering soreness deep inside me, I wouldn't know what was real and what was nothing but false hope.</p><p>I pulled the beer out of his grasp and turned away.</p><p>I didn't want to say we were done and over, but it was certain now that we needed a break from each other.</p><p>Gideon needed to figure out what he was doing, what he was looking for, and whether I had any meaningful place in his life.</p><p>Because this roller-coaster ride we were on was going to break me, and I couldn't let that happen.</p><p>I wouldn't.</p><p>\"Can I help with anything?\" he asked.</p><p>I answered without looking at him, because doing so was too painful.</p><p>\"Can you see if we can get Cary out here? He's got a wheelchair.\"</p><p>\"All right.\"</p><p>He left the room, and I could suddenly breathe deeply again.</p><p>Ireland hurried over.</p><p>\"What happened to Cary?\" \"I'll tell you about it while we set the table.\"</p><p>I was surprised I could eat.</p><p>I think I was too fascinated by the silent showdown between my dad and Gideon to notice that I was stuffing food into my mouth.</p><p>At one end of the table, Cary was charming Ireland into peals of laughter that kept making me smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the other end, my dad sat at the head of the table, with Gideon on his left and me on his right.</p><p>They were talking.</p><p>The conversation had opened with baseball, as I'd expected, then migrated into golf.</p> <p>On the surface, both men seemed relaxed, but the air around them was highly charged.</p><p>I noticed that Gideon wasn't wearing his expensive watch.</p><p>He'd planned carefully to appear as \"normal\" as possible.</p><p>But nothing Gideon did on the outside could change who he was on the inside.</p><p>It was impossible to hide what he was - a dominant male, a captain of industry, a man of privilege.</p> <p>It was in every gesture he made, every word he spoke, every look he gave.</p><p>So he and my father were in the position of struggling to find who would be the alpha, and I suspected I hung in the balance.</p><p>As if anyone were in control of my life but me.</p><p>Still, I understood that my father had only really been allowed to be a dad in the last four years, and he wasn't ready to give it up.</p><p>Gideon, however, was jockeying for a position I was no longer prepared to give him.</p><p>But he was wearing the ring I'd given him.</p> <p>I tried not to read anything into it, but I wanted to hope.</p><p>I wanted to believe.</p><p>We'd all finished the main course and I was pushing to my feet to clear the table for dessert when the intercom buzzed.</p><p>I answered.</p><p>\"Eva?

appeared out of the hallway, shoving his phone into his pocket.</p><p>I wondered who'd been calling him all night.</p><p>\"Eva Tramell,\" the female detective said, stepping deeper into my apartment.</p><p>She was a thin woman with a severe face and sharply intelligent blue eyes, which were her best feature.</p><p>Her hair was brown and curly, her face clean of makeup.</p><p>She wore slacks over dark flats, a poplin shirt, and a lightweight jacket that didn't hide the badge and gun clipped to her belt.</p><p>\"I'm Detective Shelley Graves of the NYPD.</p><p>This is my partner

had a strong face and dark eyes that raked the room while Graves focused on me.</p><p>\"Hello,\" I greeted them.</p><p>My father shut the door, and something about the way he moved or carried himself

him.</p><p>\"Why don't we sit down.\"</p><p>We all moved into the living room, but only Ireland and I ended up taking a seat.</p><p>Everyone else remained on their feet, with my dad pushing Cary's

to.\"</p><p>Graves nodded, her eyes still on me.</p><p>\"Can you tell us if you're familiar with a man named Nathan Barker, Miss Tramell?\" The room spun.</p><p>Cary cursed and pushed unsteadily to his feet, taking the few steps to reach the seat beside me.</p><p>He caught up my hand.</p><p>\"Miss Tramell?\" Graves took a seat on the other end of the sectional.</p><p>\"He's her former

me.</p><p>\"Mr.</p><p>Cross,\" Graves said.</p><p>\"What about you?\" \"What about me?\" \"Do you know Nathan Barker?\" My eyes pleaded with Gideon not to say anything in front of my dad, but he never once glanced my way.</p><p>\"You wouldn't be asking that question,\" he answered, \"if you didn't already know the answer.\"</p><p>My stomach dropped.</p><p>A violent shiver moved through me.</p><p>Still, Gideon wouldn't look at me.</p><p>My brain was trying to process what was happening .</p><p>what it meant .</p><p>what was going on .</p><p>\"Is there a point to these questions?\" my father asked.</p><p>The blood was roaring in my ears.</p><p>My heart was pounding with something like terror.</p><p>The mere thought of Nathan being so close was enough to send me into a

about.\"</p><p>Michna nodded, as if he'd expected the interruption.</p><p>\"Nathan Barker was found dead this morning.\"</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>As soon as Detective Michna finished his sentence, my dad cut the questioning off.</p><p>\"We're done here,\" he said grimly.</p><p>\"If you have any further questions, you can make an appointment for my daughter to come in with counsel.\"</p><p>\"How

and a few half- naked - street performers.</p><p>I snapped pictures with my phone and sent them to Cary for a laugh.</p><p>My dad was impressed with the emergency responder presence in the city and liked seeing the police officers on horseback as much as I did.</p><p>We took a ride around Central Park in a horse- drawn carriage and braved the subway together.</p><p>I took him to Rockefeller Center and Macy's and the Crossfire, which he admitted was an impressive building more than capable of holding its own among other impressive buildings.</p><p>But through it all, we were just hanging out.</p><p>Mostly walking and talking and simply being together.</p><p>I finally learned how he'd met my mom.</p><p>Her sleek little sports car had gotten a flat tire and she'd ended up at the auto shop where he was working.</p><p>Their story reminded me of the old Billy Joel hit \"Uptown Girl,\" and I told him so.</p><p>My dad laughed and said it was one of his favorite songs.</p><p>He said he could still see her sliding out from behind the wheel of her expensive little toy car and rocking his world.</p><p>She was the most beautiful thing he'd seen before or since .</p><p>until I came along.</p><p>\"Do you resent her, Daddy?\" \"I used to.\"</p><p>He put his arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\"I'm never going to forgive her for not giving you my last name when you were born.</p><p>But I'm not mad about the money thing anymore.</p><p>I'd never be able to make her happy in the long run, and she knew herself enough to know that.\"</p><p>I nodded, feeling sorry for all of us.</p><p>\"And really\" -

they hadn't - and filling me in if the police had contacted her or Stanton that day.</p><p>I worried that they were circling around Stanton, but I had to believe that because my stepfather was obviously innocent, there was nothing for them to find.</p><p>Still .</p><p>I wondered if they would end up finding anything.</p><p>It was obviously a homicide or they wouldn't be investigating.</p><p>With Nathan being new to the city, who did he know who'd want to kill him? In the back of my mind, I couldn't help but think that Gideon had arranged it.</p><p>That made it harder for me to get over him, because there was a part of me - the little girl I'd once been - who'd wanted Nathan dead for a long time.</p><p>Who'd wanted him to hurt like he'd hurt me for years.</p><p>I'd lost my innocence to him, as well as my virginity.</p><p>I'd lost my self-esteem and self-respect.</p><p>And in the end, I'd lost a child in an agonizing miscarriage when I was no more than a child myself.</p><p>I got through every day one minute at a time.</p><p>I forced myself to go to Parker for Krav Maga, to watch TV, to smile and laugh when it was appropriate - most especially around Cary - and to get up every morning and face a new day.</p><p>I tried to ignore how dead I felt inside.</p><p>Nothing was vivid to me beyond the pain that throbbed through me like a constant dull ache.</p><p>I lost weight and slept a lot without feeling rested.</p><p>On Thursday, Day Six After Gideon: Round Two, I left a message with Dr.</p><p>Petersen's receptionist letting her know that Gideon and I wouldn't be coming to our sessions anymore.</p><p>That evening, I had Clancy swing by Gideon's apartment building, and I left the ring he'd given me and the key to his apartment in a sealed envelope with the front desk.</p><p>I didn't leave a note because I'd said everything I had to say.On Friday, one of the other junior account managers got an assistant, and Mark asked if I'd help the new hire get settled.</p><p>His name was Will and I liked him right away.</p><p>He had dark hair that was curly but worn short.</p><p>He had long sideburns and wore square-framed glasses that were very flattering on him.</p><p>He drank soda instead of coffee and was still dating his high school sweetheart.</p><p>I spent much of the morning showing him around the offices.</p><p>\"You like it here,\" he said.</p><p>\"I love it here.\"</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>Will smiled back.</p><p>\"I'm glad.</p><p>I wasn't sure at first.</p><p>You didn't seem all that enthusiastic, even when you were saying good stuff.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"My bad.</p><p>I'm going through a tough breakup.\"</p><p>I tried to shrug it off.</p> <p>\"It's hard for me to get excited about anything right now, even things I'm crazy about.</p><p>This job being one of them.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry about the breakup,\" he said, his dark eyes warm with sympathy.</p><p>\"Yeah.</p><p>Me, too.\"</p> <p>Cary was looking and feeling better by Saturday.</p><p>His ribs were still bandaged and his arm was going to be in a cast for a while, but he was walking around on his own and didn't need the nurse anymore.</p><p>My mom brought a beauty team over to our apartment - six women in white lab coats who took over my living room.</p><p>Cary was in heaven.</p><p>He had no qualms whatsoever about enjoying spa day.</p><p>My mom looked tired, which wasn't like her at all.</p> <p>I knew she was worried about Stanton.</p><p>And she was maybe spending time thinking about my dad, too.</p><p>It seemed impossible to me that she wouldn't, after seeing him for the first time in nearly twenty-five years.</p><p>His longing for her had been hot and alive to me;

We're both reacting totally different from the way we would have just a month ago.\"</p><p>He was different.</p><p>He smiled, and there was something unique about that warm curving of his lips.</p><p>\"We trust each other, Eva.</p><p>It feels good, doesn't it?\"\"Trusting you doesn't mean I'm any less baffled by what's going on between us.</p><p>Why are we hiding in this office?\" \"Plausible deniability.\"</p><p>Gideon straightened and came to me.</p><p>Cupping my face in his hands, he tilted my head back and kissed me sweetly.</p><p>\"I love you.\"</p><p>\"You're getting good at saying that.\"</p><p>He ran his fingers through my new bangs.</p><p>\"Remember that night, when you had your nightmare and I was out late? You wondered where I was.\"</p><p>\"I still wonder.\"</p><p>\"I was at the hotel, clearing out that room.</p><p>My fuck pad, as you called it.</p><p>Explaining that while you were puking your guts out didn't seem to be the appropriate time.\"</p><p>My breath left me in a rush.</p><p>It was a relief to know where he'd been.</p><p>An even bigger relief to know that the fuck pad was no more.</p><p>His gaze was soft as he looked at me.</p><p>\"I'd completely forgotten about it until it came up with Dr.</p><p>Petersen.</p><p>We both know I'll never use it again.</p><p>My girl prefers modes of transportation to beds.\"</p><p>He smiled and walked out.</p><p>I stared after him.</p><p>The security guard filled the open doorway and I shoved aside my roiling thoughts to examine later, when I had the time to really grasp where they were leading me.</p><p>On the walk home, I picked up a bottle of sparkling apple juice in lieu of champagne.</p><p>I saw the Bentley every now and then, following along, ever ready to pull over and pick me up.</p><p>It used to irritate me, because the lingering connection it represented deepened my confusion over my breakup with Gideon.</p><p>Now, the sight of it made me smile.</p><p>Dr.</p><p>Petersen had been right.</p><p>Abstinence and some space had cleared my head.</p><p>Somehow, the distance between me and Gideon had made us stronger, made us appreciate each other more and take less for granted.</p><p>I loved him more now than I ever had, and I felt that way while I was planning on a night just hanging out with my roommate, having no idea where Gideon was or who he might be with.</p><p>It didn't matter.</p><p>I knew I was in his thoughts, in his heart.</p><p>My phone rang and I pulled it out of my purse.</p><p>Seeing my mother's name on the screen, I answered with, \"Hi, Mom.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand what they're looking for!\" she complained, sounding angry and tearful.</p><p>\"They won't leave Richard alone.</p><p>They went to his offices today and took copies of the security tapes.\"</p><p>\"The detectives?\" \"Yes.</p><p>They're relentless.</p><p>What do they want?\" I turned the corner to reach my street.</p><p>\"To catch a killer.</p><p>They probably just want to see Nathan coming and going.</p><p>Check the timing or something.\"</p><p>\"That's ridiculous!\" \"Yeah, it's also just a guess.</p><p>Don't worry.</p><p>There's nothing to find because Stanton's innocent.</p><p>Everything will be okay.\"</p><p>\"He's been so good about this, Eva,\" she said softly.</p><p>\"He's so good to me.\"</p><p>I sighed, hearing the pleading note in her voice.</p><p>\"I know, Mom.</p><p>I get it.</p><p>Dad gets it.</p><p>You're where you should be.</p><p>No one's judging you.</p><p>We're all good.\"</p><p>It took me until I reached my front door to calm her down, during which time I wondered what the detectives would see if they pulled the Crossfire security tapes, too.</p><p>The history of my relationship with Gideon could be chronicled through the times I'd been in the Cross Industries vestibule with him.</p><p>He'd first propositioned me there, bluntly stating his desire.</p><p>He'd pinned me to the wall there, right after I'd agreed to date him exclusively.</p><p>And he'd rejected my touch that horrible day when he had first started pulling away from me.</p><p>The detectives would see it all if they looked back far enough, those private and personal moments in time.</p><p>\"Call me if you need me,\" I said as I dropped my bag and purse off at the breakfast bar.</p><p>\"I'll be home all night.\"</p><p>We hung up, and I noticed an unfamiliar trench coat slung over one of the bar stools.</p><p>I shouted out to Cary, \"Honey, I'm home!\" I put the bottle of apple juice in the fridge and headed down the hallway to my bedroom for a shower.</p><p>I was on the threshold of my room when Cary's door opened and Tatiana came out.</p><p>My eyes widened at the sight of her naughty nurse costume, complete with exposed garters and fishnets.</p><p>\"Hey, honey,\" she said, looking smug.</p><p>She was astonishingly tall in her heels, towering over me.</p><p>A successful model, Tatiana Cherlin had the kind of face and body that could stop traffic.</p><p>\"Take care of him for me.\"</p><p>Blinking, I watched the leggy blonde disappear into the living room.</p><p>I heard the front door shut a short time later.Cary appeared in his doorway, looking mussed and flushed and wearing only his boxer briefs.</p><p>He leaned into the doorway with a lazy, satisfied grin.</p><p>\"Hey.\"</p><p>\"Hey, yourself.</p><p>Looks like you had a good day.\"</p><p>\"Hell yeah.\"</p><p>That made me smile.</p><p>\"No judgment here, but I assumed you and Tatiana were done.\"</p><p>\"I never thought we got started.\"</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair, ruffling it.</p><p>\"Then she showed up today all worried and apologetic.</p><p>She's been in Prague and didn't hear about me until this morning.</p><p>She rushed over wearing that, like she read my perverted mind.\"</p><p>I leaned into my doorway, too.</p><p>\"Guess she knows you.\"</p><p>\"Guess she does.\"</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\"We'll see how it goes.</p><p>She knows Trey's in my life and I hope to keep him there.</p><p>Trey, though .</p><p>I know he won't like it.\"</p><p>I felt for both men.</p><p>It was going to take a lot of compromising for their relationship to work out.</p><p>\"How about we forget about our significant others for a night and have an action movie marathon? I brought some nonalcoholic champagne home.\"</p><p>His brows rose.</p><p>\"Where's the fun in that?\" \"Can't mix your meds with booze, you know,\" I said dryly.</p><p>\"No Krav Maga for you tonight?\" \"I'll make it up tomorrow.</p><p>I feel like chilling with you.</p><p>I want to sprawl on the couch, and eat pizza with chopsticks and Chinese food with my fingers.\"</p><p>\"You're a rebel, baby girl.\"</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\"And you've got yourself a date.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Parker hit the mat with a grunt and I shouted, thrilled with my own success.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said with a fist pump.</p><p>Learning to toss a guy as heavy as Parker was no small feat.</p> <p>Finding the right balance to gain the leverage I needed had taken me longer than it probably should have because I'd had such a hard time concentrating over the last couple of weeks.</p><p>There was no balance in my life when my relationship with Gideon was skewed.</p><p>Laughing, Parker reached out to me for a hand up.</p><p>I gripped his forearm and tugged him to his feet.</p><p>\"Good.</p> <p>Very good,\" he praised.</p><p>\"You're firing on all cylinders tonight.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.</p><p>Wanna try it again?\" \"Take a ten-minute break and hydrate,\" he said.</p><p>\"I need to talk to Jeremy before he takes off.\"</p><p>Jeremy was one of Parker's co- instructors, a giant of a man that the students had to work their way up to.</p> <p>Right then, I couldn't imagine ever being able to fend off an assailant of his size, but I'd seen some really petite women in the class do it.</p><p>I grabbed my towel and my water and headed toward the aluminum bleachers lined up against the wall.</p><p>My steps faltered when I saw one of the detectives who'd come to my apartment.</p><p>Detective Shelley Graves wasn't dressed for work, though.</p><p>She wore a sports top and matching pants with athletic shoes, and her dark, curly hair was pulled back in a ponytail.</p><p>Since she was just entering the building and the door happened to be next to the bleachers, I found myself walking toward her.</p><p>I forced myself to look nonchalant when I felt anything but.\"Miss Tramell,\" she greeted me.</p><p>\"Fancy running into you here.</p> <p>Have you been working with Parker long?\" \"About a month.</p><p>It's good to see you, Detective.\"</p><p>\"No, it's not.\"</p><p>Her mouth twisted wryly.</p><p>\"At least you don't think so.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>Maybe you still won't when we're done chatting.\"</p><p>I frowned, confused by that tangle of words.</p><p>Still, one thing was clear.</p><p>\"I can't speak to you without my attorney present.\"</p><p>She spread her arms wide.</p><p>\"I'm off- duty.</p><p>But anyway, you don't have to say anything.</p><p>I'll do all the talking.\"</p><p>Graves gestured toward the bleachers, and I reluctantly took a seat.</p><p>I had damn good reason to be wary.</p><p>\"How about we move a little higher?\" She climbed to the top, and I stood and followed.</p><p>Once we were settled, she set her forearms on her knees and looked at the students below.</p><p>\"It's different here at night.</p><p>I usually catch the day sessions.</p><p>I told myself that on the off chance I happened to run into you off- duty someday, I'd talk to you.</p><p>I figured the chances of that were nil.</p><p>And lo and behold, here you are.</p><p>It must be a sign.\"</p><p>I wasn't buying the additional explanation.</p><p>\"You don't strike me as the type to believe in signs.\"</p><p>\"You've got me there, but I'll make an exception in this case.\"</p><p>Her lips pursed for a moment, as if she were thinking hard about something.</p><p>Then she looked at me.</p><p>\"I think your boyfriend killed Nathan Barker.\"</p><p>I stiffened, my breath catching audibly.</p><p>\"I'll never be able to prove it,\" she said grimly.</p><p>\"He's too smart.</p><p>Too thorough.</p><p>The whole thing was precisely premeditated.</p><p>The moment Gideon Cross came to the decision to kill Nathan Barker, he had his ducks in a row.\"</p><p>I couldn't decide if I should stay or go -
