Andra Madison could barely hear him now, even though her ear was pressed to a crack in the brick wall of the abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Omaha. Those muffled, mewling sobs of fear broke her heart and made her want to tear the monsters who had kidnapped Sammy apart with her bare hands. Or blow them apart with her shotgun. That worked, too.</p> <p>Even at three in the morning, the July air was still hot and thick with humidity, making it hard to breathe. Then again, maybe that was just her reaction to fear talking. There were at least four monsters in there guarding Sammy\u2014twice as many as she\u2019d ever managed to defeat before. And that battle had been a close call. She wasn\u2019t quite sure yet how she was going to get the boy out alive. She\u2019d have to wing it, and pray for the best.</p><p>One of the monsters let out a deep growl that sent a jolt of primal fear ripping through her system. Sweat broke out on her forehead as she fought the urge to flee. She planted her boots hard and gritted her teeth until the need to run away washed over her and started to fade. She was left shaking and dripping with sweat, but at least she\u2019d held her ground.</p><p>Andra knew just what these creatures were capable of\u2014had seen it with her own eyes on more than one occasion\u2014and the sound they were making now wasn\u2019t a good sign. The monsters were getting ready to feed.</p><p>The image of Sammy\u2019s small body being ripped to shreds by claws and teeth filled her mind and made her stomach heave. She couldn\u2019t let that happen. Not this time.</p><p>Andra had officially run out of time to scout the building and plan her attack. Plan or not, she had to get little Sammy out of there right now.</p> <p>She hopped up three cement stairs and twisted the knob on the old warehouse door, but it was locked. Of course. The windows were too high for her to climb through, and she wasn\u2019t about to go wasting any time trying to find another way in. There was no time left, and she\u2019d promised Sammy\u2019s parents she\u2019d bring their baby home alive.</p><p>Stupid, stupid, stupid.</p><p>She never should have made promises she might not be able to keep, but when faced with so much fear and panic in the pleading eyes of helpless parents\u2014so much love\u2014she couldn\u2019t help herself. She\u2019d foolishly wanted to give them hope.</p><p>After all the times she\u2019d failed to find a stolen child, or rescue them before it was too late, she should have known better than to make any empty promises.</p><p>Andra took a deep breath for courage, said a quick prayer for luck, gripped her shotgun tight, and slammed the heel of her boot against the rotting door. Chunks of splintered wood burst into the giant room where Sammy was being held prisoner. Andra crouched low, using the frame of the door for concealment as she peered into the warehouse, frantically searching for some kind of plan that would get them both out alive.</p><p>It was dark in there, with only a few streaks of grimy yellow streetlight flowing in through the broken windows set high in the walls. The building was old, and it showed every one of its years in fallen beams and cracked mortar. Graffiti covered the walls, and trash was heaped in little mounds here and there. The wooden floor was filthy where it wasn\u2019t simply missing, leaving ragged holes to whatever space lurked below.</p> <p>Along the far side of the room she saw Sammy. He was tied to one of the few columns still strong enough to hold up the roof. His eyes were huge with fear, and tears streamed down his face, leaving narrow lines of clean skin in their wake. A dirty rag had been stuffed in his mouth, but Andra could hear Sammy\u2019s pitiful whimpers coming from behind the gag. He was still alive, thank God. Now all she had to do was get him out of here in the same condition, and back home where he belonged.</p><p>Piece of cake. Or it would have been, had it not been for the hungry, salivating monsters standing between her and the boy.</p><p>Andra had been hunting these things for eight years and she still had no other word for them besides monsters . They were the size of large dogs, with the head of a wolf and the body of a chimpanzee. They had long, sharp claws and teeth to match. Oily, matted black fur covered their bodies, and long strings of glowing yellow saliva dripped from their too-wide jaws. And for reasons Andra still had not figured out, the creatures that kept these things as pets liked to steal children.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see any of those six-foot-tall insectoid monsters around, but she knew they wouldn\u2019t be far away from their precious pets.</p><p>Her explosive entry had pulled the monsters\u2019 attention away from the little boy and placed it squarely on her\u2014a much better place for it, as far as she was concerned.</p><p>They prowled toward her on all fours, their long claws leaving ragged scratches in the old wooden floor.</p><p>Fear threatened to make her sluggish, and once again she had to fight back the urge to flee and leave the boy to fend for himself. She wasn\u2019t frightened easily, but these things had the ability to make her blood congeal and her breath freeze in her lungs. There was something unnatural about the fear they caused. It was more than just being face-to-face with so many claws and teeth. It was more than simply fearing for her life. There was some instinctive knowledge buried deep inside her that warned her that when she faced these monsters, she was facing something bigger and darker than she was able to imagine. And after all the things she\u2019d seen, she had a pretty vivid imagination.</p><p>Andra forced herself to even out her breathing, stay calm, and focus on getting Sammy out alive. She shut out that unnatural fear and pretended she was just facing down rabid dogs. A terrified corner of her mind giggled at the ridiculous notion, but she ignored it as best she could.</p> <p>Andra prayed her hands would stop shaking long enough to get a clean shot; then she stood from her crouch and leveled the shotgun at the largest of the beasts. There was still almost a hundred feet between her and them, and anything less than a point-blank shot would just piss them off.</p><p>So she stood there, just outside the doorway, where they could come at her only one at a time, and waited for the monsters to close the distance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re close,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cHow close?\u201d asked Paul. Excitement prowled through his system, making him grip the steering wheel tighter.</p><p>He glanced at the Sanguinar as he sped through the run-down industrial area on the edge of Omaha. Logan\u2019s eyes gave off an eerie silver glow in the darkness, and he was staring into the distance at something Paul could not see. He wasn\u2019t sure Logan knew what he was doing, but he sure as hell hoped so. Paul\u2019s future\u2014his life\u2014hung in the balance.</p><p>If they found the woman and she was the one, the power that had been building inside him for decades, and the pain it caused, would finally have an outlet.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been driving all over the Midwest for days,\u201d griped Madoc from the backseat. \u201cFucking bloodsucker doesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s just jerking you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come with us,\u201d said Paul. He didn\u2019t care much for the loner in the backseat. He took too many chances and wouldn\u2019t have recognized a team player if one had been sitting in his lap. He was the kind of man who left body bags in his wake. His only saving grace was that usually, the bad guys needed more of those body bags than the good guys did.</p><p>\u201cJoseph decided otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you follow orders?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my reasons,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>\u201cWhich are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your fucking business. And, for the record, just because I\u2019m here doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think this is a load of shit. If it was so easy for Logan to find female Theronai, then why didn\u2019t we know about this particular skill a hundred years ago, before our men started dying off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d asked Paul. \u201cWhat if Logan can track Helen\u2019s bloodline and find more women like her?\u201d</p><p>In the rearview mirror, Paul saw Madoc sneering at Logan. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so busy following this supposed trail we haven\u2019t killed a demon in days. My sword arm\u2019s gonna be one big marshmallow by the time you figure out Logan\u2019s full of shit. He\u2019s leading you on for your blood, man. Don\u2019t you get that?\u201d</p><p>It might be true. Paul knew it was possible. The Sanguinar were not the most trustworthy of men. Their need for blood made them . . . unpredictable. If Paul hadn\u2019t been so desperate to find a woman like Helen, he never would have bargained with Logan.</p><p>But he was desperate. The pain was becoming unbearable. He wasn\u2019t sure why his body didn\u2019t explode, why the power he housed didn\u2019t just rip through skin and bone and tear him apart. He was up to three hours of meditation every day just to be able to function, to get out of bed each night. He had only a couple of leaves left clinging to his lifemark, and at the rate they\u2019d been falling, he wasn\u2019t sure his soul would live more than another ten days. After that, things would get ugly fast.</p><p>\u201cGo left here,\u201d whispered Logan in a strained voice. \u201cI\u2019ve found her.\u201d</p><p>A bright bubble of hope swelled up inside Paul as he gunned the engine and took a hard turn. He blasted right through a stop sign, but it was past three a.m. and no one was around in this aging industrial area. Besides, if the cops wanted to ticket him, they\u2019d have to catch him first.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d asked Paul. \u201cYou\u2019ve really found a blooded woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking sucker,\u201d spat Madoc in disgust. \u201cThere is no woman. We\u2019re going to show up and he\u2019s going to give you some story about how we just missed her, just like every other night this week.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t respond to Madoc\u2019s accusation. His face was serene as he stared off into the night. His eyes flared brighter for a moment and he sucked in a harsh breath. \u201cHurry, Paul. She\u2019s not alone. I sense Synestryn.\u201d</p><p>Fear of losing the woman who could save him before he even found her made Paul\u2019s gut clench. He ground the accelerator to the floorboard just as he saw movement at the end of the street. There wasn\u2019t much light, but there was enough for him to make out the shape of a woman standing in a doorway. \u201cThere she is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking believe it,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>Neither did Paul. Logan had actually tracked down a woman who might be able to save his life. A woman with some of the same blood running through her veins as Helen, who was the first female Theronai to have been born in over two hundred years. They still had no idea where Helen had come from, but after seeing the miracle she\u2019d been for Drake, he hardly cared.</p><p>Paul screeched to a halt outside the old warehouse, nearly running the SUV into the metal railing that bordered the parking area. His headlights shone on the remains of a wide doorway and the woman standing in it. She was tall\u2014nearly six feet\u2014though maybe her commanding stance and the confident grip on her shotgun made her seem taller.</p><p>Paul had already unfolded himself from the car and unsheathed his sword when he saw two Synestryn demons\u2014sgath\u2014charging her, and two more behind them. Shotgun or not, she was no match for that many teeth and claws. They\u2019d slice her to pieces before she had time to pull the trigger twice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet out of there!\u201d he shouted at the woman as he raced up three cracked cement stairs toward her. He could hear the heavy footsteps of Madoc and Logan pounding behind him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn to look at him, or even bother to acknowledge that she\u2019d heard him. In fact, she showed no sign of the greasy, paralyzing fear the Synestryn usually caused in humans. She appeared to be completely calm, as if she waited for demons to attack her every day.</p><p>The sgath closed in to within fifteen feet and showed no signs of slowing. He was still too far away to help her. He was going to see her die before he even had a chance to touch her and learn whether she was meant to be his, whether she could save him.</p><p>She fired her shotgun at the closest sgath. Her body rocked slightly against the force of the weapon and the deep boom echoed in the stillness of the night. She\u2019d hit one of the demons. It flew back a couple feet, spraying black blood across the warehouse. Beneath the thick, oily drops, the wooden floor began to sizzle as the caustic blood ate away at it.</p> <p>If any of that blood had hit her, it would eat away her skin just as easily.</p><p>Paul finally reached the woman. He wanted to stop and touch her, but there was no time. Another sgath was right there, only feet away. Whether or not she could save him, the fact that she faced the sgath down without fear proved she was a rare gift and had to be protected at all costs.</p><p>Paul shouldered her out of the way and charged through the doorway, sword poised and ready to strike. She hit the wall a little harder than he\u2019d intended and let out a pained grunt, but at least she was out of harm\u2019s way.</p><p>An uninjured sgath saw Paul charge and its eyes lit with a sickly green fire of excitement and hunger. It lifted its muzzle and let out a haunting howl to the rest of its kind, likely alerting them to the food that had just arrived. There was nothing the demons liked more than to feed on the flesh and blood of a Sentinel, and Paul and his companions were a walking feast.</p><p>It took Andra a couple of seconds to recover from being slammed into the brick wall. Good thing it had been her shoulder that had hit first instead of her head. Otherwise, she\u2019d have been out cold. When this was over, she was going to have a long talk about manners with the man who\u2019d pushed her, but right now she had to get Sammy out of here.</p> <p>By the time Andra had shaken off the impact, two of the three men who\u2019d shown up were already inside the warehouse. She wasn\u2019t sure who they were, or why they were here, but she wasn\u2019t about to question her good fortune. Or their swords.</p><p>The monster she\u2019d shot was still on the floor, but it was moving sluggishly, lapping up pools of its own blood with its long, forked tongue. She knew from experience that if it got enough of its blood back inside, the thing would stand up again, all patched up and good as new.</p><p>Andra couldn\u2019t help but shudder at the sight. It was one that was going to stick with her for a lot of nights to come.</p><p>Great. Like she needed any more nightmare fuel.</p><p>Another monster was backing away from the man who\u2019d pushed her. He had dark blond hair and stark, angular features. He wielded a sword a little shorter than his arm, and from the muscular width of his shoulders and the ease with which he moved the weapon, it was obvious that he\u2019d had plenty of practice with it. Thank God he was apparently on her side.</p><p>The monster crouched, then sprang up unnaturally fast, but the man was ready for the attack. He ducked below the monster\u2019s leap and swung the sword in a powerful arc that sliced open its belly. The man leapt aside gracefully, dodging the spray of filth and gore that spilled from the monster.</p> <p>The thing landed with a wet, squishy sound and let out a roar of defiance as it tried to regain its footing. The man moved in what appeared to be an almost lazy circle, and his sword gleamed in a dim yellow arc of light. When he came to a stop, the head of the monster lay ten feet away from its body.</p><p>Black smoke rose up from where the thing\u2019s blood pooled on the wooden floor, burning it. The smoke created a stench so violent that Andra had to fight back the urge to puke.</p><p>\u201cHow we doing, Madoc?\u201d asked the man, never moving his eyes from the remaining threat.</p><p>On the far side of the warehouse, Andra watched the second man\u2014an angry-looking guy with blunt features and thick black hair\u2014as he cut down another one of the monsters. He wasn\u2019t even breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cOne down, one to go,\u201d he said as he prowled closer to the last monster standing. The thing had backed itself into a corner, and Andra was pretty sure that it wasn\u2019t going to make it back out alive.</p><p>\u201cI smell more closing in,\u201d said a deep voice from behind her. Too close.</p><p>Andra jumped in surprise and whirled around, pointing her shotgun at the third man in the group. As she laid eyes on him, her brain leaked out her ears and she stood there, staring, unable to do anything else.</p><p>He was beautiful. Heart-stopping, seizure-inducing beautiful, with dark hair, bright silvery eyes and a cover-model face. He was a little thin for her taste, but he made it work well enough that she changed her mind right then and there.</p> <p>He gave her a knowing smile full of bright white teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019m Logan. My friends and I have been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Andra gave herself a mental shake and blinked so she could stop staring at him. \u201cI\u2019m not taking on any new cases right now. Kinda got my hands full with Sammy here.\u201d</p><p>He frowned slightly in confusion and waved an elegant hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. Right now, we need to get inside before the rest of the Synestryn show up.\u201d</p><p>Just then, Andra looked over his shoulder into the surrounding darkness and saw the faint glowing green eyes of more monsters closing in. \u201cRight. Inside.\u201d</p><p>Andra peered through the door into the warehouse and saw both men slicing and dicing the remaining monsters. They had their hands full at the moment, and Logan didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d be much good in a fight as thin as he was. In fact, he looked downright breakable, which revved up her protective instincts.</p><p>Andra grabbed Logan and hauled him through the door with her. She picked up the biggest part of the door she\u2019d wrecked and propped it across the open doorway. Thank goodness she\u2019d been hitting the weights lately or she never would have been able to lift the solid oak slab.</p><p>\u201cStart shoving these old pallets in the way to slow those things down,\u201d she ordered Logan. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Sammy.\u201d</p><p>She sprinted across the floor, leaping over a gaping hole in the wood. They had only a few seconds before those new monsters arrived, and with any luck, they could free Sammy and find a back door out of this place before the nasties broke through the barricade.</p><p>She reached Sammy, but he was silent and staring off into space, which wasn\u2019t a good sign. His eyes were wide with shock and fear, and he cringed away from her as she approached. Tears still overflowed his eyes, and were so abundant they wet the collar of his pajama shirt.</p><p>Andra was wasting precious seconds, but she couldn\u2019t stand the thought of adding to his fear. She found a smile somewhere and forced herself to wear it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Sammy. Your mom and dad sent me. I\u2019m here to take you home.\u201d</p><p>As gently as she could, she removed the dirty rag from his mouth and sliced through the ropes that bound him. It took only seconds, but by the time she was finished, the blond sword-wielding man was standing a few feet away, guarding her back.</p><p>The monster she\u2019d shot and barely damaged was now lying in several sloppy pieces strewn across the warehouse floor. He\u2019d done that for her, and from the black blood leaking out of the rest of the monsters, he\u2019d done more as well.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, but Sammy doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><p>The man nodded once, as if he understood exactly what she meant. Then again, he seemed prepared for a fight like this. Maybe he did know what was going on here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Paul. I\u2019m going to get both you and the boy out of here alive.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t sound like an empty boast. His words were solid and heavy with confidence.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve done this before, Paul?\u201d she asked him in a conversational tone.</p><p>He turned and gave her a wink. \u201cOnce or twice. Stay well behind me. Their blood is caustic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take Sammy and look for a back door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Stay where I can see you. There may be more hiding out in the building.\u201d</p><p>Andra thought about arguing and realized he could be right. She wasn\u2019t willing to risk it, especially since Sammy would be with her.</p><p>The first monster hit the barricade. The broken door and rotting pallets shifted easily.</p><p>Paul moved toward the barricade. The angry-looking man stepped up beside Paul, facing the threat. They both lifted their swords like they knew how to use them. Then again, there was proof of that fact scattered all over the warehouse floor.</p><p>The beautiful Logan moved to the back of the warehouse near Andra. \u201cI\u2019m going to go locate another exit. Paul and Madoc have handled worse than this before, but it pays to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what Paul said? There may be more hiding in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf so, I\u2019ll be able to smell them coming. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not one to risk my life needlessly.\u201d He smiled at her again, only this time she was pretty sure she\u2019d seen fangs. Lovely.</p><p>Andra picked Sammy up and backed away until they were against the far wall. Whoever these men were, they weren\u2019t normal. Until she found out more, she wasn\u2019t going to let Sammy get close to any of them.</p><p>He let out a soft, hopeless whimper. Andra looked down and he was staring back at her with unseeing eyes. She\u2019d seen that exact look before on a night much like this one, and every week since, for the past eight years.</p><p>She was too late. Even if she got him out alive, Sammy was lost forever.</p><p>The monsters crashed through the barricade\u2014two more of the wolf-chimpanzee things and two of the larger, roachlike monsters that kept them as pets. They were easily six feet tall and walked upright on short, spiny legs. Their tiny heads held four beady black eyes that zeroed right in on Sammy.</p><p>One of them let out a metallic hiss that sounded like the word child, then pointed toward Sammy and Andra. The other nodded, let go of the leash it held, and unfurled a wide pair of wings. It leaped up into the air and landed clinging to one of the warehouse support beams.</p><p>The furry monsters charged the pair of men while the second roach thing held back.</p><p>Andra set Sammy safely behind her and aimed her shotgun at the roach thing on the beam. She fired and her shot took a big chunk out of where the monster had been. Unfortunately, it had jumped out of the way, avoiding her blast. She scanned the ceiling as she reloaded, looking for it, but it was nowhere in sight. She heard a buzzing noise behind her and whirled around to find the roach thing flying right toward her and the boy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to finish reloading and get off another shot. She grabbed the barrel of the shotgun and leveled it in front of her face to keep those snapping insect jaws away.</p><p>It slammed into her. She heard something crack and pain screamed up her arm. She screamed right back at it, unable to hold in her cry of agony. The weapon clattered to the ground, and Andra tried to bring her hands up to grab ahold of the roach\u2019s neck, but her left arm didn\u2019t respond. It hung uselessly at her side, burning with bone-deep pain that made her stomach spin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She managed to get one hand against the roach\u2019s chest, but it was strong. It pushed her back easily, making her boots slide over the wooden floor. Sammy was being pushed back with her, his little body limp and rolling along behind her.</p><p>Andra took a quick look over her shoulder and saw that they were speeding toward one of those gaping holes in the floor. Sammy was going to fall first if she didn\u2019t do something.</p><p>Unfortunately, nothing came to mind.</p><p>A roar of outrage billowed up from somewhere in the room, but she couldn\u2019t figure out where it had come from, or what it meant. It was all she could do to stand upright and try to slow the thing down.</p> <p>From the corner of her eye, she saw a metallic gleam flash past her; the roach thing\u2019s head flew off and its body started to fall forward.</p><p>Every beat of her heart made her arm throb, but she ignored it and put the last of her strength into shoving the roach thing to one side. It toppled over and hit the floor in a dry rattle.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d asked Paul. His sword was coated in slime and the roach\u2019s head was rolling around near his feet.</p><p>She did a quick survey of the warehouse and saw only corpses. All of the monsters were dead, thanks to these men. She never would have survived tonight without them.</p><p>Andra nodded. \u201cMy arm\u2019s broken, but I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p> <p>Now, if she could just stay upright and not crumple at his feet, that would be great. Very professional.</p><p>She focused on Paul in an effort to not think about the pain. His hair had the look of being perpetually mussed. He was several inches taller than Andra, which was no small feat, as she was five-ten barefooted. She could tell, even under his clothes, that he was muscular, but not so bulky that it hindered his movements. She\u2019d seen his grace firsthand and had to admire anyone who could move that fast, that smoothly, while still looking like he was using no more effort than he did to walk down the street.</p><p>But more than any of that, it was his face that held her interest. He wasn\u2019t model beautiful like Logan. She wasn\u2019t even sure she\u2019d call him handsome, but there was something in his face that intrigued her\u2014drew her in. Weary lines framed his mouth as if he\u2019d been through hell, but his stance was strong and steady. He might have suffered, but he hadn\u2019t been defeated.</p><p>Andra had nothing but respect for a man like that, which was foolish, because she knew nothing about him. The notion that she could read him by looking at his face was just plain stupid. Then again, stupid was the theme for the night.</p><p>Whoever he was, he\u2019d saved her life tonight, and for that she was grateful.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>Paul reached toward her as if he were going to touch her face. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d shouted Logan. \u201cNot here. It\u2019s too dangerous. You know what happened to Drake once he touched Helen.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s hand closed into a fist and he let it fall back to his side.</p><p>Maybe it had been her imagination, but the closer his hand got to her, the less her arm hurt. Now that he was backing away, the pain flared up again and she locked her knees to stay upright.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not great,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d offered Logan. \u201cMend your arm and take the pain away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch her blood and you\u2019re a dead man,\u201d said Paul, his voice rough with menace.</p> <p>Andra glanced at her arm, panicked that she might be bleeding. The monsters seemed to be able to smell her blood and it sometimes drew them to her. \u201cWhat blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what he meant,\u201d said Logan. \u201cHe\u2019s simply being a bit possessive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake warned us all about what you did to Helen. You\u2019re not going to do that to her.\u201d</p><p>Andra had no idea what they were talking about, but right now, she really didn\u2019t give a damn. She wanted to get Sammy out of here and get her arm set so that maybe it would stop making her sick with every throbbing heartbeat. \u201cI really appreciate the fact that all of you were here tonight, and I hate to ask for more help, but there\u2019s no way I can drive. Can one of you guys drive my truck to the hospital and drop us off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hospital won\u2019t help the boy,\u201d said Logan. \u201cBut I can.\u201d</p><p>Andra didn\u2019t trust him. No one that pretty was human. As far as she knew, he was one of them.</p><p>She stepped in front of Sammy and gave Logan a level stare. \u201cStay away from him. He\u2019s my responsibility and you\u2019re not touching him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got good instincts. I\u2019ll give her that,\u201d said the angry-looking man.</p><p>Logan\u2019s voice dropped to a warning tone. \u201cStay out of this, Madoc. It doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern you anymore, either,\u201d said Paul. \u201cYour job was to help me find her. Now you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a bargain,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cAnd I will uphold my end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But what if she isn\u2019t the one? You haven\u2019t touched her yet.\u201d</p><p>Andra was hurting too much to keep up with their conversation. She knew she was at the center of it, but she had no idea why. And frankly, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to care right now. \u201cCan we please get Sammy to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>Logan looked like he was going to say something, but Paul spoke over whatever it was. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He knelt in front of the boy, but was still looking at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndra what?\u201d demanded the man they\u2019d called Madoc. He had blunt features that looked like they\u2019d crack if he tried to smile.</p><p>A wave of pain rushed over her and she had to grit her teeth to stay upright. Already, she could feel the skin below her shoulder starting to swell. \u201cMadison,\u201d she grated out. \u201cAnd just so we\u2019re clear, don\u2019t even bother asking for my phone number. I don\u2019t date guys who carry swords.\u201d</p><p>Truth was, she didn\u2019t date, period. She never had time, not with the recent increase in the disappearances of children across the Midwest. She was lucky if she found time to sleep and eat. More children disappeared every month and she needed to be available to find them.</p><p>Not that her efforts had done Sammy any good. Poor little guy was lost now\u2014locked inside the terror that he\u2019d seen tonight. At least she could tell his parents which facilities would care for him best. She\u2019d researched them all.</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d said Paul. \u201cFix her arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a doctor?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not touching me. All I need is a lift out of here and we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can mend the bone,\u201d said Logan. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple enough task so soon after a break.\u201d</p><p>As bizarre as that news was, as leery as she was of taking any more help from these not-quite-human strangers, Andra was tempted to accept their offer. Being in a cast for six weeks didn\u2019t sound like a lot of fun to her at all. Taking that much time off work wasn\u2019t going to be good for all the missing children, either. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d simply reach inside you with my mind and put the pieces back together.\u201d</p><p>Andra was stunned silent for a moment. He sounded serious, a fact that creeped her out even more. \u201cRight. I think I\u2019m ready for that ride now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let him touch you if it wasn\u2019t safe,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>She breathed in too deeply and another sharp pain stabbed through her arm. \u201cI don\u2019t know who or what all of you are, but I\u2019m not sure I want to know more. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this planet is already messed up enough as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not ready to accept us yet, Paul,\u201d said Logan. \u201cGive her some time. Once the pain is too much, she\u2019ll give in.\u201d</p><p>Not likely, but then again, they didn\u2019t know her very well, so she could forgive his ignorance.</p><p>\u201cIf you change your mind,\u201d said Paul, \u201clet me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Just load Sammy into my truck, please.\u201d</p><p>Paul looked down at the boy with such compassion it made her chest ache. Clearly, he didn\u2019t know it was too late. She had been too late. She\u2019d failed. Again. That failure raked through her, hurting worse than any broken bone ever could.</p><p>Maybe it was time to hang up her shotgun. Stop using her ability to find lost children for good this time. She tried to be stoic, but at times like this, it was hard. She wanted so badly to save them all.</p><p>\u201cHey, little guy,\u201d Paul said in a deep, soothing voice. One wide, battle-scarred hand ran over the boy\u2019s limbs as if checking for injury. On the man\u2019s left hand was a strange ring\u2014a simple band that pulsed with color, swirling in an iridescent mix of baby rainbows. Andra had a hard time not staring at it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Paul, and I just want you to know that you\u2019re safe now. Nothing is going to hurt you. Not while I\u2019m around.\u201d</p><p>And even as cynical as Andra was\u2014even knowing the things she knew about just how many monsters roamed the night\u2014she believed Paul was telling the truth. That alone was more incredible than the fact that real monsters existed.</p><p>Logan pulled in a deep breath through his nose. \u201cWe need to hurry with the child. He\u2019s pulling away fast.\u201d He turned and looked at Madoc. \u201cYou should do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way, leech. I don\u2019t mess with kids\u2019 minds. They\u2019re too easy to scramble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScramble?\u201d asked Andra, shifting her body between Madoc and Sammy. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d said Paul; then he turned his attention to Logan. \u201cIf Madoc isn\u2019t up to it, I\u2019ll take care of the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too weak,\u201d said Logan. \u201cI took too much blood from you earlier. Madoc needs to do this.\u201d</p><p>Madoc shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of finesse and you know it. You want me to kill something, I\u2019m your man, but I don\u2019t go patching people up. That\u2019s your job.\u201d</p><p>Logan pinned Madoc with a bright stare. \u201cAre you offering to supply the power I need to heal the boy\u2019s mind?\u201d</p><p>Madoc\u2019s face twisted in a snarl and he bared his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re not touching my blood. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Andra looked between the two men, trying to sort out what was going on. If she\u2019d been able to drive she might have tried to slip out of here with Sammy while they argued. But she couldn\u2019t even lift the boy, much less drive, and if she tried, chances were she\u2019d be more likely to kill Sammy than to get him home to his parents. \u201cYou can really help Sammy?\u201d she asked Logan. \u201cIf all you need is blood, I\u2019ll give you some of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d shouted both Paul and Madoc at the same time.</p><p>Logan fixed her with a stare that made her feel trapped. Deer-in-the-headlights, doom-speeding-her-way trapped. \u201cAs tempting as that offer is, I fear these men would cut me down if I so much as plucked a hair from your head. Maybe another time.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to let a couple of brawny guys stand in the way of Sammy\u2019s future. Not while there was still a shotgun lying a few feet away. She took a tentative step toward it. She wasn\u2019t sure how she was going to finish reloading with only one good arm, but she\u2019d manage somehow. \u201cI want you to help Sammy,\u201d she told Logan. \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d If there was hope for him, maybe there was hope for Nika. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andra crushed that thought flat before it could blossom. She had no room in her life for false hope. She knew just how bleak things really were, and it was best if she stayed a realist, just like she\u2019d always been.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch her blood,\u201d growled Paul in a tone that made the fine hairs on her neck stand up. \u201cI\u2019ll help the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d asked Logan. \u201cI took a lot from you tonight so I could find her.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes flicked to Andra so briefly she wasn\u2019t sure it had happened. \u201cIt was worth it. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m strong enough for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019re not?\u201d asked Madoc.</p><p>Paul pressed his hand against his chest as if it hurt, then handed Madoc his sword. \u201cThen you know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Paul carried Sammy outside into the night and found a patch of rich earth that would aid him in healing the boy.</p><p>Andra and Logan trailed behind him, while Madoc kept watch over the area, ensuring that they\u2019d know if company arrived.</p> <p>Paul wanted nothing more than to touch Andra and find out whether she was the woman he\u2019d been looking for for decades. The only thing holding him back was her safety, as well as Sammy\u2019s. He couldn\u2019t do anything to mess up this time. This was his last chance. If he did touch her, and he went through that same incapacitating pain Drake had suffered with Helen, there was no way he\u2019d be able to protect them if more Synestryn came.</p><p>And they would come; it was just a question of how long they had before it happened and whether or not they would still be here.</p><p>The sooner Sammy\u2019s mind was cleaned, the faster Paul could get Logan to fix her arm. He knew she had to be in pain. All the color had leached from her face and she was holding herself at an odd angle. Already, the leather sleeve of her jacket was stretching tight over her broken arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get out of that jacket before you can\u2019t,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe swelling\u2019s getting worse.\u201d</p><p>She gave it a gentle tug, winced, and asked, \u201cAny of you boys have a knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d said Logan. A sharp claw extended from the end of his finger, replacing his manicured fingernail.</p> <p>Andra flinched at the sight, and hissed in pain as the motion jarred her broken bone. \u201cHoly shit! What the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold still. I won\u2019t damage you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not,\u201d said Paul as he resisted the urge to go to her and reassure her. Keeping his distance was the most maddening form of torture possible. Moments ago, another leaf had fallen from his lifemark, leaving one, and he still wasn\u2019t sure whether she was the woman who could save him.</p><p>He\u2019d been given two chances before. Even wishing for a third seemed like some kind of sacrilege. Too bad it didn\u2019t stop him from wishing anyway.</p><p>Andra stripped out of her destroyed leather jacket with a little help from Logan. Although her left arm was puffy and distorted, the rest of her was all sleek muscles and strong, feminine lines. Her clingy shirt showed off small, perfect breasts and muscular abs. He wondered how much time and effort a body like that had cost her and whether or not the man in her life was appropriately appreciative.</p><p>He certainly would be, given the chance.</p><p>Paul pulled his gaze away from her and focused on Sammy. The child\u2019s eyes were open, unblinking. Drool leaked from one corner of his mouth and Paul gently wiped it away with the hem of his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m going to help you sleep now, Sammy. But I promise that you won\u2019t have any bad dreams. I\u2019m going to take them all away, okay?\u201d</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t expect an answer; the child was too far gone. He closed the boy\u2019s eyes and held his hand there to keep them closed. He focused on the ground under him\u2014warm, seemingly dead after long weeks of drought. He felt the soil and the rocks beneath, felt the roots of nearby trees seeking out nourishment and the tiny, hidden seeds that waited for rain to spark them to life. The earth beneath him was calm, patient, accepting of whatever came. There was power in that acceptance and Paul pulled some of that power into himself.</p> <p>Instantly, the pain he lived with daily increased, bearing down on him, grinding at his bones, and he had to clench his teeth against it to keep from crying out. His heart pounded and his head throbbed until he was blind from the sheer force of the pressure of so much more power. His body already held too much energy, but it was energy he couldn\u2019t use\u2014only store for someone else\u2019s use. Maybe Andra\u2019s.</p><p>He prayed it was so. He wasn\u2019t going to live long enough for another search. It had taken two weeks to find her, and he didn\u2019t think he had even one week left.</p><p>Paul\u2019s skin grew tight and burned, and his eyes felt like they would fly out of his head if he opened his eyelids. He could hear his breath rasping in and out too quickly as his lungs labored against the pain.</p><p>Logan was right. He was too weak for this, but it was too late now. He\u2019d pulled in enough power to reach out to Sammy and enter his mind. He was trapped inside the child until he\u2019d done what he\u2019d come here to do\u2014take away his fear, his memories.</p><p>The images inside Sammy were a chaotic swirl of teeth and claws, growls and screams. The boy was barely six, and had no way of making sense of what he\u2019d seen. His child\u2019s mind had taken the sensory input, mixed it with his terror, and created an array of images even more terrible than reality. Somewhere deep inside Sammy\u2019s mind, he felt the little boy cowering in fear, whimpering, chanting, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d</p><p>Paul felt his physical body weaken against the strain of his connection with the boy. He wasn\u2019t very good at this, but he knew enough to know that if he died while in the boy\u2019s mind, it would kill Sammy as well.</p><p>Spurred on by that thought, Paul pushed his way through those nightmares until he found the boy\u2019s mental hiding place. It was a cardboard box with crooked windows drawn on with brightly colored crayon. One side of the box had been cut open to make a door big enough for Sammy to crawl through.</p><p>Paul crouched and peered in the cardboard doorway. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay now. Stay here until you hear me call your name, and when you come out, all the monsters will be gone.\u201d</p><p>The boy cringed in the corner of the box with his hands over his ears and his eyes squeezed shut, but somehow, Paul felt that he\u2019d been heard.</p><p>He rose up and faced all the images that Sammy had created, each one horrific enough to drive the boy mad. They all had to go. Paul captured the first monster in his gaze\u2014much like a sgath, but with larger teeth and two wolflike heads. Normally, it wouldn\u2019t have frightened him, because he knew it wasn\u2019t real. But Sammy thought it was real and because of that, it had power.</p><p>Paul let himself be afraid\u2014imagined what it must be like for Sammy, so small and helpless. He imagined what it felt like to be ripped away from the safety of his home and parents and tossed into a living nightmare. He let the fear grow inside him until his hands shook and his jaw ached from fighting the need to scream. He accepted Sammy\u2019s horror as his own, absorbing it until he\u2019d taken it all into himself, then ruthlessly shoved it into the accepting earth. Burying it deep where it couldn\u2019t hurt anyone.</p><p>Slowly, the monster disappeared.</p><p>Paul was left feeling weak and dizzy, barely able to stand upright within the ethereal context of the boy\u2019s mind. He could no longer move, so he pulled in more power\u2014more pain\u2014and forced himself to take just one more step toward the next nightmare. It left him sweating and shaking and made his stomach clench in protest, but he had no choice. The child could not live with these images in his head.</p><p>Andra\u2019s arm was swiftly becoming a problem. Every breath shifted her frame enough to send searing jolts of pain through her body. And she was losing feeling in her fingers, which couldn\u2019t be good. But none of that really bothered her. What really bothered her was the fact that she was basically helpless. She didn\u2019t trust these men, no matter how helpful they seemed. What if they tried to take Sammy away? How would she stop them in a three-against-one fight, with a broken arm and an empty shotgun?</p><p>Paul was deep in concentration and Madoc was keeping watch out into the darkness. Logan and his freaky-sharp fingernails hovered nearby, lurking in the shadows. There was something unsettling about his stillness\u2014his unnatural beauty.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to hurt you,\u201d he said as if reading her thoughts. Then again, she kept looking at her shotgun lying a few feet away, so maybe, rather than being psychic, he simply wasn\u2019t an idiot.</p><p>\u201cForgive me if I\u2019m not all cheerful and trusting,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling helpless, no doubt. I can mend your arm if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic. Want to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly. I\u2019ve seen enough weirdness for one night, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cSuit yourself. The offer is\u2014\u201d He sniffed the air and she thought she saw his eyes actually put off a silvery glow. He turned to Madoc and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got company.\u201d</p><p>Company. That didn\u2019t sound good.</p><p>\u201cHow much time?\u201d demanded Madoc.</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes. Maybe three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are more of those monsters coming?\u201d she asked Logan.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Shit! She was no good in a fight like this. \u201cHow long will it take to fix my arm?\u201d</p><p>This time she was sure she saw his eyes glow just a bit\u2014a cold, hungry glow that made her feel like prey. \u201cOnly a moment, if you\u2019re willing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul\u2019s going to kill you if you take her blood,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>\u201cPaul has no say in what happens to me,\u201d said Andra. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need your blood to regain my strength once we are safely away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be plenty of it all over the grass if you don\u2019t hurry.\u201d She was pretty sure she knew just how he planned on taking her blood. The word vampire echoed around in her head, giving her the creeps. Still, if she lived long enough to bleed a little, that was fine with her. She\u2019d make more blood.</p><p>Logan spread an elegant, slim hand around the base of her neck and closed his eyes. Heat soaked into her skin, making her shiver. As the heat grew, she started to worry. His skin was too hot. He was going to burn her. She had to pull away.</p><p>Just as she thought about moving, she felt his other arm clamp around her waist, pressing her hard against his frame. He was stronger than he looked. Much stronger. And she\u2019d been wrong about his being merely thin\u2014he was practically a skeleton under his clothing, all sharp angles and jagged bones.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time or the strength to be gentle,\u201d he whispered in a strained voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Andra wasn\u2019t sure what he meant until she felt the bone in her arm shift and pain became her whole world. It slid through her veins and blistered her from the inside out. A scream bubbled up out of her against her will. Searing heat burned inside her as if welding the bone together. The burning went on and on until she was out of breath from screaming and sweat had soaked her clothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, it ended. She felt his arm loosen, and she shoved herself away from him. He stumbled backward. His eyes rolled back in his head as if he\u2019d passed out, and she scrambled to catch him before his head hit the concrete.</p><p>His limp weight was hard to handle, but she managed to ease him to the ground. Her left arm twinged, but it worked, and that was what really mattered.</p><p>Andra didn\u2019t waste any time checking to see if he was okay. There was nothing she could do for him now except keep the monsters off of him until they could all get the hell out of here.</p><p>She fetched her shotgun, reloaded it, and stood guard over the group.</p> <p>\u201cYou really think that\u2019s gonna help, little girl?\u201d asked Madoc, eyeing her weapon.</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwords work better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but only if you know how to use one.

Any ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you drive?\u201d</p><p>In the distance, she saw a faint pair of glowing green eyes. \u201cI can now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can drag Logan? Get him into the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what I need to do. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. I\u2019ll load Paul and the kid as soon as he\u2019s done here and we\u2019ll all get the hell out of Dodge.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed to take an eternity, but one by one, Paul drove each of Sammy\u2019s nightmares into the earth. Not even the acidic power of fear was strong enough to bother the stones beneath him.</p><p>Paul pulled out of the child\u2019s mind, gasping for air. He slumped with fatigue, but strong arms supported him. He was too tired to open his eyes and see who was there.</p><p>\u201cCan you stand?\u201d asked Madoc. His voice was close. He was the one keeping Paul from falling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Give me a minute.\u201d He was panting and his weakness grated against his nerves. He didn\u2019t want to show even the slightest hint of weakness to Andra or give her any other reason to shun him. He had to be strong and prove to her he was worthy of her.</p><p>\u201cIs Sammy going to be okay?\u201d Andra asked. Her voice flowed over him like cool, clean water, restoring some of the strength his efforts had drained. He wanted to reach for her and feel her skin beneath his fingertips, but his arms weren\u2019t listening and they stayed locked around Sammy\u2019s body.</p><p>Paul nodded in response to her question, but even that small motion was draining. His body felt bruised from the inside out, and he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was strong enough to stand. Removing Sam\u2019s nightmares had taken its toll on his body, and he didn\u2019t know how long it would take him to recover. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping now,\u201d rasped Paul. \u201cBut he\u2019ll wake up soon, and when he does, he needs his parents to be there.\u201d Only the soothing touch of a mother and the protective embrace of a father were going to finish the healing process Paul had begun.</p><p>\u201cNo time to chat,\u201d said Madoc. \u201cWe need to get moving.\u201d</p><p>A deep sgath howl split the predawn silence. It was close, and Paul was in no shape to fight.</p> <p>\u201cHelp me up and I\u2019ll recover in the car.\u201d Paul forced his eyes open, hoping it would settle his churning stomach. He didn\u2019t think puking all over Andra\u2019s boots was going to win him any points.</p><p>\u201cLet me have Sammy,\u201d said Andra. Her short brown hair reflected the light from the lamp overhead. Her stance was rigid, her blue eyes mistrustful. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to drop him.\u201d</p><p>Great. Now she thought he couldn\u2019t even carry a small child. Fantastic. He almost told her he\u2019d never do that, but his arms were shaking and weak enough that he didn\u2019t want to take a chance. Even if he did look like a wimp, at least the boy would be safe.</p><p>She took the limp weight of the child in her arms just as two more sgath broke through a distant line of trees.</p><p>\u201cTime\u2019s up,\u201d said Madoc, and hauled Paul across the parking lot to the SUV he\u2019d left running.</p><p>Paul\u2019s legs had just started to cooperate when Madoc shoved him in the back door. He scooted over to the far seat, making room for Andra to join them.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. In fact, she wasn\u2019t even behind him. She was already in her own vehicle\u2014a beat-up Ford that looked like it had been on the losing end of a fight or two already\u2014headed down the street away from the oncoming Synestryn demons.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s leaving!\u201d shouted Paul.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re right behind her. Chill.\u201d Madoc slammed the SUV in gear, and the tires screamed as he sped down the street after her. Or at least she should have been there, but wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Paul scanned the streets and saw nothing. \u201cWhere did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? There are a ton of side streets around here. She probably took one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind her, damn it.\u201d Desperation made his words sharp and angry.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of sgath on our tail, so maybe finding her and the kid isn\u2019t the best thing right now. At least if the Synestryn are following us, they\u2019re not following her.\u201d</p><p>Paul looked over his shoulder, and sure enough, there were two demons on their bumper, keeping pace with the SUV as easily as if it were sitting still. No way could they lead those things to Andra and Sammy. \u201cVeer off. We\u2019ll find a place to take them out and then go after her. Logan found her once. He can find her again.\u201d</p><p>Paul hoped it wasn\u2019t just wishful thinking.</p><p>The Sanguinar was slumped in the front seat, his head lolling around like a rag doll\u2019s as Madoc took a hard right. \u201cIf he regains consciousness before dawn, you mean.\u201d</p><p>The SUV sped up, and the sgath started to fall back, unable to keep pace.</p><p>Madoc spun into a turn and brought the SUV to a rocking stop. He shot Paul a grimace via the rearview mirror. \u201cThere\u2019s good news and bad news. Which do you want first?\u201d</p><p>Paul still felt like hell\u2014weak and shaky\u2014but at least his legs were stronger. Madoc leaped from the vehicle while Paul kind of spilled out; then he and Madoc took a stand in a recently plowed field.</p><p>The sgath saw them there and charged. \u201cGood news would be nice right about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan will be able to find Andra no matter what, so you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>That was more than good news; it was great news. He wasn\u2019t going to lose her. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the bad news?\u201d</p><p>Paul lifted his blade and prepared for the demons\u2019 charge. Madoc did the same.</p><p>\u201cLogan can find her because he healed her busted arm. She owes him blood.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d have to pay the debt for her. No way was he going to let Logan get his fangs on her pretty neck\u2014or anywhere else. \u201cOver my dead body,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>Madoc gave him a sneering once-over. \u201cIf you feel as shitty as you look, that may very well be the case. Get that fucking sword up, man.\u201d</p><p>The closest sgath leaped into the air.</p><p>Paul sliced at the demon, but his arms were weak, putting his aim off the mark, and instead of hitting anything vital, he only managed to lop off a leg. The thing landed hard, howled in pain, and scrambled awkwardly back onto its feet.</p><p>His sword felt heavy, which was proof he wasn\u2019t fully recovered from healing Sammy\u2019s mind. But heavy or not, he\u2019d been fighting these things for centuries and knew what to do. His body followed his commands and he feinted right, fooling the sgath into thinking he\u2019d left his flank unprotected. Its teeth flashed a sickly yellow as it went for the opening. Paul shifted his weight at the last second and drove his sword down through the sgath\u2019s skull before its teeth could connect.</p><p>It wriggled there, still clinging to life, slashing at him with its front claws. Paul twisted his blade and finally the sgath went limp.</p><p>Paul had killed the thing, but he was breathing too hard and barely able to retrieve his sword. Madoc watched him, standing over his own kill, which was sliced neatly in two\u2014or not so neatly, considering what was leaking out of the sgath\u2019s gut. \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have lent a hand.\u201d</p><p>Madoc shrugged. \u201cWhat fun would that have been?\u201d</p><p>Paul wiped his blade on the grass to clean the oily black blood from it. His hands were shaking enough to piss him off. He couldn\u2019t afford to be weak right now\u2014not with Andra out there, owing a blood debt to one of the Sanguinar.</p><p>\u201cIs Logan up yet?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>Madoc checked the front seat. \u201cNope. Still out cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now how are we going to find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could look up her license plate number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could if I had it.\u201d</p><p>Madoc rattled off the number.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it when I was tearing out after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I, but I didn\u2019t remember it.\u201d</p><p>Madoc shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I remember numbers and shit like that when I see them.\u201d</p><p>Paul clapped Madoc on the shoulder, enjoying the way the physical contact made him squirm uncomfortably. \u201cYou\u2019re like some kind of genius, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the kind who\u2019s going to beat the hell out of you if you don\u2019t shut up about it and get your hands off me.\u201d</p><p>Paul held up his hands in surrender, but he couldn\u2019t hide his grin. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s a pretty cool trick you\u2019ve got there, egghead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t know Madoc well. He tended to hang out alone most of the time, keeping his distance from the rest of the Theronai. Paul had been pretty sure he wasn\u2019t going to like the loner, but time was proving him wrong. Madoc was growing on him. And he was useful as hell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call Nicholas and track her plates. You mind keeping a lookout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Paul sat down on the ground by the SUV to let his body recover, pulled out his cell phone, and dialed the compound\u2019s head of security.</p><p>\u201cThis had better be good,\u201d was how Nicholas answered the phone, his voice gritty, as if he hadn\u2019t used it in days. Maybe he hadn\u2019t. Nicholas was a bit of a recluse, choosing to stay in his techno-lair more often than not.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, met someone tonight. I need you to do a background check on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, did she borrow money from you or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that kind of background,\u201d said Paul. \u201cShe helped us save a boy from some Synestryn tonight. I need you to find out if she\u2019s hit anyone\u2019s radar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust our radar or the Sanguinar\u2019s and Slayers\u2019 radar, too?\u201d</p><p>Paul glanced at Logan. As far as he could tell, the Sanguinar was still unconscious. Good. \u201cAnyone\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019s a Dorjan?\u201d asked Nicholas, using the term for a human who worked for the Synestryn in exchange for money or power.</p><p>\u201cNo, but she faced down several Synestryn armed with only a shotgun.\u201d Paul still remembered the way she\u2019d stood there, her feet braced apart in a battle stance. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was more impressed by her courage or frightened by her ignorance. She could have been killed, and if she was what he thought she was, she was way too important for him to let her take such a chance ever again. Her life was too precious to risk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d Nicholas let out an impressed grunt. \u201cShe\u2019s probably just some gutsy human with more courage than brains. You said there was a boy involved. A lot of people can do amazing things when there\u2019s a child at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but something tells me there\u2019s more to it than that.\u201d He wasn\u2019t about to tell Nicholas that he\u2019d bargained with Logan to hunt her down, and that he knew she was blooded, at the very least. Most of the Theronai were suspicious of the Sanguinar, even though their races were currently at peace with each other. His bargain was binding and not the kind of thing that would go over well with the other men at the compound. It tied him to the Sanguinar and made him a liability if that peace didn\u2019t hold.</p><p>\u201cMore? Like what?\u201d asked Nicholas. \u201cWe\u2019d know if she was one of ours. She\u2019d have been wearing the ring of the Gerai. Did you see one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she forgot to put it on, or maybe it was out being resized.\u201d The excuses sounded ridiculous even to his own ears.</p> <p>\u201cOr maybe she just did one hell of a snow job on you and she really is a Dorjan. Tell me you didn\u2019t let her get away before you could question her or at least put a bloodmark on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had to get the boy to a hospital. Madoc got her license plate number. She won\u2019t get far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndra Madison. Nebraska plates.\u201d He gave Nicholas her plate number.</p><p>Paul heard a quick series of keystrokes and waited for Nicholas to do his magic. He had access to more information\u2014both human and Sentinel\u2014than any other man alive.</p> <p>A few seconds later, Nicholas let out a soft whistle. \u201cShe\u2019s not hard to find, that\u2019s for sure. The woman\u2019s name is plastered all over the newspapers. She\u2019s a finder of lost children\u2014one of those people that parents hire when their kid goes missing and the police and FBI can\u2019t help. Apparently, she\u2019s pretty good at it, too. So good that the police have a tag on her name to keep an eye out for her. It looks like they think she might actually be behind some of the kidnappings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they can\u2019t find the kids, but she can,\u201d guessed Paul.</p><p>\u201cSounds about right. Says here that she only takes certain cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get a sense for what kind of cases she takes?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>A few more quick keystrokes and a moment of silence followed before Nicholas said, \u201cPaul, my man, I think we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found yourself a bona fide Synestryn hunter. A human one with no connections to or support from any of the Sentinels as far as I can tell. Which means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means I\u2019d better get to her fast or she\u2019s going to walk into a situation that might get her killed.\u201d Paul had no more time to waste. He forced himself to his feet.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that now, can we?\u201d said Nicholas. Paul heard someone talking in the background; then Nicholas lowered his voice so Paul could barely hear it. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe who just walked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a sec. She wants to talk to you. I\u2019ll text you that address.\u201d</p><p>There was a scratching sound as Nicholas handed the phone to someone; then a voice came on the line. It was high and childlike but imbued with an unmistakable air of command. Sibyl. The only one among his people gifted with the ability to see into the future. When she spoke, everyone listened.</p><p>\u201cTheronai,\u201d said Sibyl. \u201cWe must speak.\u201d</p><p>Paul barely hid his shock. She\u2019d spoken to him twice in the past century, including now, and both of those times had been within the last month. Surely so much attention from her couldn\u2019t be a good thing. \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found her.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cHer? Do you mean Andra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndra,\u201d she said slowly, as if suddenly recognizing the name. \u201cYes. Andra. Bring her to me.\u201d</p><p>Paul debated whether or not to let Sibyl know that although he\u2019d found her, he\u2019d lost her once again. He\u2019d definitely find her, but it might take a little time. He hedged, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure she\u2019s going to want to go along with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen bind her. Render her unconscious. Do what you must, but bring her to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . need her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d asked Paul. As much as he respected Sibyl and her gift, he wasn\u2019t about to lead Andra into something ugly.</p><p>\u201cDo as you are told, Theronai.\u201d Her pure child\u2019s voice rang with an odd kind of power that made the hair on his nape stand on end.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t right now. She\u2019s not with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind her. Bring her. Today. Should you fail, the repercussions shall be . . . unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can,\u201d he promised. The power of that promise wrapped around him as he was bound to his word, making it hard to breathe for a moment.</p><p>\u201cSee that you do. Her presence is vital. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead and Paul shoved his phone into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cGood news, I take it,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>\u201cSame ol\u2019, same ol\u2019. Can you drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo find Andra and bring her back to Sibyl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit? Sibyl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Madoc shook his head. \u201cGreat. If that moppet is getting involved, things can\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>It took Andra more than three hours to get Sammy reunited with his parents and convince the authorities that whoever had taken him was long gone by the time she found him. She gave them the only story she could: She had no clue who the kidnapper was, and if she remembered anything new, she\u2019d be sure to let them know.</p><p>She hated lying to the police, but it was better than being locked up in a seventy-two-hour psych hold. Again. Crazy did run in families. Thank God no one knew about Nika.</p><p>She gave the police the address of the warehouse, knowing that by the time they got there, the sun would have done a thorough job of burning away the remains of the monsters they had killed. Other than scorch marks in the floor, there would be no evidence left that the boy had been stolen by furry, clawed monsters.</p><p>Synestryn demons. That was what those men had called them.</p><p>Usually putting a name to something made it less frightening, but not in this case. Just knowing that the things were so common they had a name was enough to scare the spit out of her. She didn\u2019t let herself think about it, because no matter how tired she was, something like that would roll around in her head, making sleep impossible.</p><p>And right now, she needed sleep more than anything. Her body was on the verge of going on strike. Everything ached, and her head felt like she\u2019d had a fog machine shoved into one of her ears. If she didn\u2019t get some sleep soon, her legs would just give out and refuse to propel her forward anymore. She\u2019d been to that not-even-one-more-step point before and it wasn\u2019t pleasant. She had maybe another few minutes before she reached it again. At that point, wherever she was, that was where she\u2019d sleep.</p><p>Maybe her dreams would be nice for a change\u2014filled with manly, sword-wielding warriors and their pretty-boy vampire buddy. She could work with that imagery. And she was a sucker for a man who liked kids. Paul had put serious effort into saving Sammy from a life of screaming lunacy, and whatever he\u2019d done had worked. Sammy was all smiles and hugs by the time she handed him into the loving arms of his mother. It was as if nothing had happened to him.</p><p>Maybe Paul could somehow help Nika, too.</p><p>Then again, maybe she was just fooling herself. When she got this tired, her instincts weren\u2019t trustworthy, so it wouldn\u2019t have surprised her to learn that, even though Paul had seemed like a decent guy, he was really some sort of self-proclaimed faith healer. Who carried a sword. Nice combo.</p><p>Andra pulled her truck into the garage of her apartment complex, praying she\u2019d stay awake long enough to brush her teeth before she collapsed into bed.</p><p>She threw her purse on the kitchen counter, ignoring the sink full of dirty dishes and the stacks of unopened mail. None of it mattered as much as getting onto her mattress.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d said Paul from her couch, making Andra jump and her system flood with a whole new pile of adrenaline.</p><p>He\u2019d kicked off his shoes and was lounging there as if he had every right to be in her home. \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind that I let myself in. You left the balcony door unlocked.\u201d</p><p>Andra stopped dead in her tracks, though her foggy brain had some trouble making sense out of what she was seeing. It took her a few seconds to find her tongue through all the shock. \u201cI never leave my door unlocked,\u201d she said, as if that were the most important thing to point out, rather than the fact that he was inside her home without her permission. \u201cAnd we\u2019re three stories up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else would I have gotten in?\u201d he asked, daring to give her a charming grin that made his brown eyes glitter.</p><p>It was such a logical question, and she was so damned tired she just couldn\u2019t figure out any sort of intelligent response. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting for you,\u201d he said, as if she should have known.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour truck\u2019s license plate. I\u2019ve got a friend at the DMV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend who is at work this early in the morning? It\u2019s not even eight yet.\u201d</p><p>Paul shrugged. \u201cYou look beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. See, the problem is that I don\u2019t tend to go to bed when there\u2019s a stranger in my living room.\u201d</p><p>That charming grin widened into a smile. \u201cWe\u2019re not strangers. I know all about you.\u201d</p><p>That sounded a little creepy, making her wish she hadn\u2019t left her shotgun in her truck. \u201cListen. I don\u2019t know how you got in and I really don\u2019t care right now. All I want is for you to leave so that I can get some sleep.\u201d She couldn\u2019t even remember what day it was. That was a bad sign.</p><p>Paul got up and came to stand right in front of her. He was a couple inches taller than she was in her boots, and from this distance, she could see warm splinters of firelight gold in his brown eyes. His beard hadn\u2019t been shaved today, giving his jaw additional shadows to accentuate the sharp angles of his face. A small scar above his left eyebrow was stark against the deeper tan of his skin, and if the circles under his eyes were any indication, he was just as tired as she was. \u201cI can\u2019t leave without you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFine, then can we just sit down and talk for a few minutes?\u201d Something about the way he said it told her that it wasn\u2019t even close to what he really wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, we can talk about it in a few hours. I\u2019ll meet you at the coffee shop on the corner at six, okay?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cThis can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna have to.\u201d She turned to walk away and opened the door for him, hoping he\u2019d take the hint and get out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have to know.\u201d</p><p>Paul put his hand on her shoulder and stopped her in her tracks. His palm was warm, even through the fabric of her shirt. Her head spun for a moment, and his touch brought about the strangest feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Maybe she\u2019d met him somewhere before? She didn\u2019t think so, considering the fact that she was pretty sure she\u2019d remember a man like him\u2014an alarming mixture of masculine appeal and confidence with the competence to back it up. Not to mention the whole part where he carried a sword.</p><p>She turned to look at him, hoping that would help her remember who he was. He was staring down at his hand with an odd jumble of hope and confusion flashing in his brown eyes. After a second, he cleared his throat. \u201cDid you feel anything?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah, but she was going to play it cool. This stuff was all too weird for her. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, distracting her for a second with the impressive width of his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe it only works if I touch bare skin.\u201d</p><p>Andra had heard a lot of lines designed to get her naked before, but this one was by far the strangest. \u201cWhat only works if you touch bare skin?\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand down her arm until just the tips of his fingers contacted the skin below her sleeve. Heat seeped into her, along with something else. Something odd, like a jolt of static electricity, but one that didn\u2019t hurt. In fact, it felt pretty good and was feeling better by the second.</p><p>Strength roared through her system, making the need for sleep vanish. Her body came alive, soaring with a heady rush of pleasure that made her sure she could float. Her fatigue drained away, leaving behind a faint, humming energy in its wake.</p><p>She looked up at Paul, shocked at what he was doing to her, but the sudden motion made her dizzy and she lost her balance and instinctively grabbed him to steady herself.</p> <p>He pulled her close, and she went without a fight, unable to do anything else in the midst of her vertigo.</p><p>\u201cEasy, now,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>As his words slid inside her, Andra\u2019s world ground to a halt. Her nose was pressed against his throat and she could smell the heat of his skin, see the throbbing of his pulse along the thick column of his neck. A pale, luminescent band shimmered only inches from her eyes, and she had the irresistible urge to reach out and pull it from him. She wanted it. Needed it. That choker was hers and always had been.</p><p>He was hers. All of him. From the bottom of his wide, booted feet to the top of his mussed hair and all of the lovely, hard places in between.</p><p>She breathed in deeply, pulling in his scent. A low hum of arousal swirled inside her, pushing away the grating fatigue that had ruled her only moments before. She still wanted to get into bed, but not for sleep. She wanted Paul there with her, naked and laid out for her pleasure. She was going to take her time getting to know what he liked. Lots and lots of time.</p><p>But the bed was too far away for her to wait. She needed to touch him. Taste him. Her hands went to the hem of his knit shirt and snaked beneath it. Warm, firm skin tempted her fingers to explore him further, while she pressed her open mouth against the side of his neck.</p> <p>She heard him make an incoherent sound of surprise, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind what she was doing. In fact, he tilted his head to one side to give her room to slide her tongue over his salty skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is happening?\u201d he said in a rough voice.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know, I\u2019m going to have a heck of a good time showing you.\u201d</p><p>This was madness, but she couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself, nor did she care that she couldn\u2019t. She shoved his shirt off over his head to get to more skin, needing to feel more of him beneath her hands. He was heavily inked, sporting a large tattoo of some kind of tree that stretched from his shoulder and upper arm all the way down below his belt. She was dying to see just how far down it went.</p><p>The limbs of his tattoo were highly detailed, mostly bare except for one single leaf, and she was pretty sure it was some kind of metaphor for life or some crap like that. Not that she cared. He could be as philosophical as he wanted as long as he did it naked.</p><p>She ran one finger along a branch, down the trunk of the tree to where it hit the low-slung waist of his jeans. His abs clenched as if he\u2019d been hit, making ridges of muscle stand out for her enjoyment.</p><p>Paul shuddered at her touch, but when she moved to pop the button on his fly, he grabbed her hands and held them locked inside a strong grip.</p><p>\u201cWe should stop,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>She looked into his eyes, which were dark with need\u2014all those golden slivers were gone now, eaten up by his pupils. His cheeks were flushed and a fine sweat had beaded up along his hairline. \u201cDon\u2019t you want me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes. Can\u2019t you feel me shaking?\u201d</p><p>She could, and it made her smile with a sense of victory. \u201cMy bedroom is right through that door.\u201d</p><p>Paul groaned and closed his eyes. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you, though I wish like hell it were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis . . . thing we\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>He was right. She didn\u2019t normally undress strangers who broke into her house. Something was off here.</p><p>Andra shook her head, trying to clear it or make some sense out of the jumble of thoughts and feelings going through her brain.</p><p>While she was distracted, Paul let go of her and stepped back. His posture said he thought she might hit him or something, because he was all tensed up like he was expecting to take a punch.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hit him, of course, but the need to get him naked was also fading. He was still hot, especially with all those muscles in his chest and abs on display, but at least now she could keep her tongue to herself.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if that was an improvement or not.</p><p>Andra\u2019s hands were shaking, so she shoved them into her jeans pockets. Her bone-deep weariness was coming back fast, as if it had never been gone at all. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot sure.\u201d His tone was hard, his words curt.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you make that sound like it\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand\u2014the one with the iridescent band\u2014and stared at it as if his life depended on it. The baby rainbows trapped in it were dancing up a storm, swirling around as if kicked up by some invisible wind. \u201cDo you see color?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, all of them. Where did you get that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story. Look harder. Do you see any one color more than the others?\u201d</p><p>Andra stared at the band, loving the flow of rainbows over the surface. It was hypnotic. Mesmerizing. Beautiful. But she didn\u2019t see any dominant color. \u201cNo. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just mistook you for someone else. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t hurt when Paul stopped touching Andra. That was the thought that kept echoing in Paul\u2019s brain, making him crazy. It was supposed to hurt. He\u2019d needed it to hurt.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted Andra to be the one for him so badly that he\u2019d begun to believe it was true.</p><p>What a fool he was to think he deserved another chance. Drake had found Helen first, so he\u2019d failed there, and he\u2019d never been able to make Kate happy, though heaven knew he\u2019d tried his best. She\u2019d been dead for two hundred years and he still couldn\u2019t figure out why she couldn\u2019t love him\u2014what more he could have given her to make her happy.</p><p>Paul refused to dwell on it. Even if Andra wasn\u2019t his lady, she might be able to save one of his brothers. Clearly she was blooded. In fact, based on the way his luceria reacted, she was probably a Theronai. Just not his.</p><p>Paul looked down at his chest. The last leaf on his lifemark swayed in time with the summer breeze outside. It looked a little more brown than green today. He really didn\u2019t have much time left, and he still had one more job to do: get Andra to Dabyr, just as Sibyl commanded.</p><p>\u201cWe should get moving,\u201d he told Andra.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere until I\u2019ve had about ten hours of sleep. Besides, what makes you think I\u2019d go anywhere with you, period?\u201d</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t have the patience for this. Too much was at stake here. Even if he hadn\u2019t been bound by his vow to Sibyl to bring Andra home, he needed to get her back so they could see if she would be compatible with any of the other men there. They were all dying\u2014just not as soon as he was. She might be able to save one of his brothers in arms. Bringing her to Dabyr was the one last thing he could do for his people before he went to his death.</p><p>He grabbed her by the shoulders and backed her up against a wall. She felt good under his hands, which pissed him off. Why would she feel so good if she wasn\u2019t his?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving. You\u2019re coming with us. You can walk, or I\u2019ll carry you. Your call.\u201d</p><p>To her credit, she didn\u2019t cower or back down, even when faced with an armed man of his size. Her blue eyes brightened at the challenge and she tipped her chin up to meet his gaze. \u201cYou think you can push me around?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPush, pull, drag. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have responsibilities. People who need me. I\u2019m not going to let you decide where I go. Sorry to burst your macho bubble.\u201d</p><p>Paul figured he had a couple of choices. He could make good on his threats and drag her out of here kicking and screaming, which would no doubt get her neighbors\u2019 attention, or he could use a little finesse.</p><p>Finesse wasn\u2019t his strong suit, but he\u2019d do what it took to get her back to Sibyl and the men.</p><p>He let out a long, slow breath and removed his hands from her body, hoping it would help him stay level. \u201cWhat responsibilities?\u201d Maybe he could take care of them, leaving her free to go back with him.</p><p>\u201cI have a job to do. Kids are being taken from their homes all the time. I need to be here to find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about your talent. Just how is it that you\u2019re able to find them when no one else can?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She pushed away from the wall, and he noticed her balance was a little unsteady. Maybe she was more exhausted than he thought.</p><p>Paul reached out to help her, but she swatted his hands away and sank onto the couch as if standing were no longer an option. \u201cI\u2019m good at what I do. That\u2019s why they pay me the big bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really doubt that\u2019s the whole story, but if it\u2019s money you\u2019re after, I can pay. I\u2019ve got plenty, and I\u2019ll give you whatever you want if you come with me.\u201d</p><p>He saw a hint of victory flare in Andra\u2019s eyes, and he knew he\u2019d found the right lever to use with her. Money.</p><p>She got up, rummaged through some papers on the kitchen counter, and scribbled down something on a notepad. She ripped off the top sheet and handed it to him. \u201cThis is the account number where I want the money sent. Put half a million in there today and I\u2019ll go wherever you want. Deal?\u201d</p><p>Paul took the paper, and something in him shriveled. He\u2019d pictured her as some great heroine who did whatever it took to find the children, no matter how much money she made. He\u2019d thought she was one of the good guys, like him. He\u2019d been wrong. She was just another person trying to make a buck off of the pain and suffering of others. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How could he have been so wrong? His instincts were usually better than that.</p><p>Paul couldn\u2019t look her in the eye. He couldn\u2019t bear to see the greed he knew would be lurking there. \u201cDeal,\u201d he said, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to shake her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to grab a quick shower,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the money is in there when I get out, we can leave.\u201d</p><p>Andra nearly wept with relief when Paul agreed to her terms. He was already on his cell phone making the transfer of funds into her account when she went to shower. She couldn\u2019t believe how easy it had been.</p> <p>Finally, Andra could be sure that Nika was always going to have a place to live. Between the half million Paul was giving her, and Andra\u2019s large life insurance policy, if anything happened to Andra, Nika would always be cared for. She\u2019d be safe.</p><p>Andra made quick work of washing off the sweat of pain and fear from last night, and threw on the first mostly clean pair of jeans she could find. Her laundry was becoming a problem\u2014one she\u2019d have to deal with when she got back, but not now. Now she had to hit the road with a man she barely knew. A man who made her go mushy with just a single touch.</p><p>Andra was going to have to be really careful that she didn\u2019t let him touch her anymore.</p><p>She went into the living room, presentable but by no means glamorous. Her hair was still wet and she hadn\u2019t bothered to take time for makeup. She was just too damn tired to care what she looked like.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d said Paul, his tone bleak. The warmth in his eyes had disappeared, making him look less human. More deadly. She\u2019d seen him in a fight and knew that the man was a formidable opponent, but she\u2019d never worried that she\u2019d be on the receiving end of his sword.</p> <p>Until now.</p><p>The money had changed the way he looked at her, and no matter how much she told herself it didn\u2019t matter, she knew it was a lie. She wanted him to like her. Respect her. She had no idea why it mattered. It never had before. She\u2019d pissed off more than just a few people in her determination to find a missing child, but with Paul it was different. That slight disdain lifting his lip when he looked at her hurt.</p><p>Andra couldn\u2019t make herself not care about what he thought, so she refused to think about it. They had a deal. Nika would be safe. Time to move on. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissouri.\u201d</p><p>Andra nearly groaned. She was too tired to drive that far. She knew she was. She\u2019d never make it there alive. Then again, if she didn\u2019t survive, Nika would get all that money from her life insurance.</p><p>She decided to put this situation under the win-win heading.</p> <p>Something in her thoughts must have come through on her face, because Paul said, \u201cI\u2019m driving. I wouldn\u2019t want you to crash your truck before you finished giving me my money\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPack for a couple days, but be quick.\u201d</p><p>Andra picked up one of two overnight bags she kept packed and ready to go at all times in case she got a call from desperate parents. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>She thought she saw a glimmer of respect cross his hard features, but she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>There was a loud pounding on her front door, as if someone were trying to kick it in.</p><p>Paul slid a sword out from nowhere\u2014which was the coolest trick ever\u2014and brought a finger to his lips for silence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably my newspaper boy wanting payment. Would you back the hell off?\u201d She stepped forward to go peek through the hole, but Paul held her back with a thick, muscular arm.</p> <p>He\u2019d just grazed the skin of her arm, but it was enough to make Andra clamp her lips shut over a groan of pleasure. A tingling warmth spread out from the point of contact and invaded her limbs, making them feel heavy and languid. She wanted to rub herself up against him like a cat, and she wished he hadn\u2019t put his shirt back on while she was in the shower. It would have felt so good to splay her fingers across his back and get to know all of the rigid muscles lying beneath his flesh.</p><p>Her skin heated until she was sure she was bright red. An aching, needy emptiness gnawed at her, and she pressed her thighs together in an effort to ease the ache. It didn\u2019t work. She needed Paul to lay her down and fill her up\u2014to slide inside her over and over until the world fell away and nothing but the two of them existed. No worries. No fears. No monsters. Only Paul and the touch of his skin on hers.</p><p>He stepped away from her, leaving her reeling, nearly swaying with the potent force of her need. She gripped the wall for support, but it did little good. She ended up sitting on her ass, shaking like she\u2019d just spent the last week throwing up.</p><p>Through the door came, \u201cIt\u2019s Madoc. Open the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Dimly, she was aware of Paul letting the surly giant inside her home. He was carrying something big and heavy and wrapped in a sheet. Booted feet stuck out of one end.</p><p>Holy shit. He\u2019d brought a corpse into her apartment.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bad,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>\u201cHow bad?\u201d asked Paul. Concern roughened the edges of his words.</p><p>\u201cHe started seizing a couple minutes ago. Thought the sun might make it worse, so I brought him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t let any light touch him, did you?\u201d asked Paul. \u201cWe don\u2019t need that kind of trouble right now.\u201d</p><p>Madoc laid his burden down on her couch and started closing the blinds over Andra\u2019s windows. \u201cDo I look like a fucking idiot? I was careful\u2014had him wrapped up nice and tight. We don\u2019t need any more surprises.\u201d</p><p>Andra pushed herself up. \u201cWhat is going on? Is that Logan?\u201d</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t even spare her a glance. He was too busy unwrapping the cocoon of sheets from around Logan\u2019s body. When he finished, he eased Logan back onto her couch. He\u2019d somehow lost more weight and was now a skeleton draped in skin. That skin was pale\u2014almost blue\u2014and he was completely still.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cNearly.\u201d Paul shot Madoc an accusing glare. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you feed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gone centuries without letting one of those leeches touch me. I\u2019m not about to start now.\u201d</p><p>She thought she heard Paul mutter something like, \u201cSelfish bastard,\u201d under his breath. \u201cWhether or not you like him, we still need him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d said Madoc. \u201cI don\u2019t need shit.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s body started to shake as if he were having a seizure.</p><p>Paul pressed his upper body over Logan\u2019s to hold him down. He held out his arm to Andra and nodded his head toward his sword lying on the floor by the couch. \u201cCut my wrist; then hold his mouth open,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Vampire. There it was again\u2014that word tugging at the frightened corners of her mind. She\u2019d seen enough things to know that monsters were real, but she didn\u2019t like knowing that this particular one existed. It was too eerie.</p><p>Or maybe it was the fact that one was in her house that bothered her.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Andra. Hurry. He\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d promised to give him her blood. Paul had already given him too much. Logan said that earlier. She couldn\u2019t risk letting him hurt himself over something she had promised to do. \u201cHow much blood does he need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it won\u2019t be enough to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Good. Then it wouldn\u2019t kill her, either. Andra took his sword just as Logan\u2019s body arched up off the couch in a particularly vicious seizure. Before Paul could stop her, she used his sword to cut open her wrist, pried Logan\u2019s lips open, and bled into his mouth.</p><p>Paul realized what she\u2019d done and he shouted, \u201cAndra, no!\u201d</p><p>The seizure stopped instantly. Logan\u2019s eerie silvery eyes opened wide and he grabbed her wrist with both hands, holding her arm against his sucking mouth in an unbreakable grip.</p><p>She figured it would hurt, but it didn\u2019t. She hadn\u2019t even felt the sword cut her arm, it was so sharp. All she could feel now was an almost gentle tugging motion against her skin, and a kind of weightlessness\u2014as if she were being filled with helium. It was strange, but not unpleasant.</p><p>In the distance, she could hear Paul shouting and see Madoc physically holding him away from Logan. But none of that mattered.</p><p>She felt an outside presence touch her mind like a warm caress. Logan. He wanted to know more about her. Who she was. Where she\u2019d come from.</p><p>Andra let him in. Having him in her head felt good, and she was too weak to fight something as strong as he was anyway. Too tired.</p><p>He wanted her to sleep. Rest. She wanted that, too.</p><p>For a moment, she worried that she\u2019d forgotten to do something. Turn off the oven? Brush her teeth? She couldn\u2019t remember what it was, and soon, it didn\u2019t seem to matter anymore. Whatever it was, it was unimportant.</p><p>Andra let go and drifted away, her weightless body floating into sleep.</p><p>Andra went limp, and a sickening flood of panic rose up Paul\u2019s throat. He thrashed against Madoc\u2019s hold, trying to get to her. \u201cWhat the fuck did you do to her, bloodsucker?\u201d</p><p>Logan licked her wrist, leaving behind no trace of her wound. He was no longer bone-thin and pale. His body had filled out and a healthy glow suffused his skin. In a calm tone, he explained, \u201cPoor child hasn\u2019t slept in three days. She was pushing herself too hard, so I put her to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Paul managed to break Madoc\u2019s hold and shoved Logan away from her. Her body slumped on the floor beside the couch, boneless and limp. He checked for a pulse and found hers strong and steady.</p><p>Relief dragged a breath from his body, and he bowed his head over hers in thanks. The scent of her skin calmed him, and he couldn\u2019t stop himself from smoothing her hair back from her face. She was going to be okay.</p><p>Paul gathered her long body in his arms and carried her into her bedroom. The place was a mess, with clothes strewn everywhere. The covers were rumpled, showing signs of where she\u2019d last slept.</p><p>Three days ago.</p><p>Paul should have been more aware of her fatigue. He should have insisted she rest. It wasn\u2019t like him to be blind to the weakness in the people around him. That could get a lot of people killed in the war against the Synestryn.</p><p>\u201cShe hid it well,\u201d said Logan from the doorway, as if reading his thoughts. Then again, their blood oath made it possible for him to do a lot of things Paul didn\u2019t enjoy.</p><p>Paul still wanted to hit the Sanguinar, but he didn\u2019t want to take his eyes off Andra, no matter how good it would have felt to lay Logan out.</p><p>\u201cI should have known, anyway. If she\u2019d been my lady, I would have.\u201d Disappointment left a bitter taste in his mouth.</p><p>He put Andra on the bed, took her shoes off, and pulled the sheets up over her slim body. She was helpless like this, and it made his protective instincts roar to life. Nothing was going to get near her until she\u2019d had time to recover. Sibyl would just have to wait.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d said Logan. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since the Theronai found partnerships. We know so little about these women. Things may be different now. The signs may be different.\u201d</p><p>Paul stalked to the door where Logan lounged, and the Sanguinar backed up. Smart man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for another disappointment, so forgive me if I don\u2019t buy into the shit you\u2019re selling. She\u2019s not mine.\u201d Saying the words aloud made his chest burn.</p><p>Logan merely smiled. \u201cI think you may be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Paul refused to let himself feel even the slightest stirring of hope. He was out of time and he was going to be a good sport and take his defeat like a man. He\u2019d had more chances than most.</p><p>Paul shut Andra\u2019s door and went in search of some food, herding Logan along with him so he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to go into Andra\u2019s room.</p> <p>Her apartment was small, with the kitchen, living, and dining areas crammed on top of one another. The place looked like it hadn\u2019t been dusted in months, except for the gleam of the heavy-duty weight bench that filled what should have been the dining room.</p><p>The open layout gave him a clear view of the whole space, including the kitchen, which needed a thorough scrubbing.</p><p>Madoc had beaten him to the hunt for food, and was already rummaging through her cabinets and fridge. From the meager offerings on the counter\u2014a couple cans of soup and some questionable lunch meat\u2014he hadn\u2019t found much.</p><p>Logan was still lurking behind him. Paul saw his sword, still stained with Andra\u2019s blood, and picked it up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s almost certainly a Theronai,\u201d said Logan.</p> <p>\u201cI kinda guessed that part.\u201d</p><p>Paul wet a paper towel and cleaned his sword, then flushed the towel down the toilet, where the scent of blood couldn\u2019t draw any trouble. They were fairly safe during the day, but he wasn\u2019t taking any chances with Andra asleep in the next room.</p><p>Logan was right on his heels. \u201cWhat makes you think she isn\u2019t yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ring doesn\u2019t respond to her like it should. No color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>Paul sheathed his weapon before he decided to use it on Logan, and spun around. They stood eye-to-eye, but there was something different about him now. Something Paul couldn\u2019t place. It was like Logan knew a secret he wasn\u2019t willing to share.</p> <p>\u201cStop already and back the hell off. I\u2019m out of time, and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go find a nest tonight?\u201d asked Madoc, completely serious. \u201cI\u2019ll stand witness for you.\u201d</p><p>Witness to Paul\u2019s last heroic act. It was a dangerous offer for Madoc to make\u2014one that might get him killed. Paul would wade into a nest of Synestryn, knowing it would be the last thing he did, and Madoc would stand by close to the action, Paul\u2019s sword safely in his keeping to take back to the Hall of the Fallen.</p><p>Paul wasn\u2019t going to like using a different sword, but he couldn\u2019t afford to let his be taken, and it wasn\u2019t as if he were ever going to make it out alive, anyway. The point was to take out as many demons as he could before they took him down.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. I\u2019m going to take you up on that offer, but I have to get Andra back to Sibyl first. I promised.\u201d</p><p>Madoc nodded and started pawing through Andra\u2019s freezer, unfazed by the talk of suicide.</p><p>\u201cGo kill yourself if you like,\u201d said Logan, \u201cbut I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re wrong about her.\u201d</p><p>Paul was going to regret asking, but he did anyway. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe felt something when you touched her.\u201d</p><p>A spark of hope lit inside him, so fragile and faint he could barely feel it. \u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t. There was no pain. No . . . nothing.\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you that your experience may be different from Drake\u2019s. We don\u2019t even know how these women exist. There\u2019s no way we can predict what kind of reaction they\u2019ll cause\u2014not after so many years of waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you Sanguinar all got together after Drake found Helen and decided that his pain was due to the time he\u2019s had to carry his power. I\u2019ve been hauling mine around for just as long, but it didn\u2019t hurt when she broke contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurt her. In a way.\u201d</p><p>Paul felt a sickening twist of guilt in his gut. \u201cI hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. Let\u2019s just say she felt a lot better when you were touching her.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d turned her on. That much was clear. She\u2019d been ready to let him take her. Maybe that was what Logan meant.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re catching on,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you see?\u201d Paul demanded. That flicker of hope was growing, and as foolish as it was, he was letting it. He wanted to know everything about her so that maybe this time things would be different. Not like Kate.</p><p>\u201cNot much. She was too weak for me to spend much time inside her mind. I sensed that she\u2019s not entirely what she seems. She\u2019s been through tragedy.\u201d</p><p>Never again. He didn\u2019t want tragedy to ever touch her life again. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cThe same as all of us. She\u2019s lost those she loved. Her mother is gone, which is a shame. I\u2019d hoped we\u2019d find a way to question her and see if Andra\u2019s father had any connection to Helen\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould they be sisters?\u201d Paul couldn\u2019t see any similarities between Helen\u2019s lush, curvy body and Andra\u2019s sleeker, muscular build. Their hair color was similar, but that was about it.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so. Their blood wasn\u2019t close enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you learn anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that she works too hard. Doesn\u2019t eat well or sleep enough most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right,\u201d grumbled Madoc from the kitchen. \u201cThere\u2019s not much here that\u2019s edible, and it\u2019s too damn early to order takeout. No one\u2019s open. I\u2019m making a food run. Any requests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Paul. \u201cJust be quick. As soon as she wakes up, we\u2019re hitting the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to take a while,\u201d said Logan. \u201cYou might as well get comfortable and take your own rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen. Not while she\u2019s vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled in satisfaction. \u201cSpeaking like a bonded man already.\u201d</p><p>Paul stared at his ring. It looked like it had for the last two centuries, only faded with time. He wanted to believe, but what if Logan was wrong?</p><p>Madoc shut the door on his way out.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not wrong?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cStay out of my head,\u201d warned Paul. \u201cI\u2019m a long way from being over you bleeding Andra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, don\u2019t listen to any offers she makes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t fed from her, you\u2019d still be thinking your days were at an end. Certainly that hope is worth something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s worth a beating if you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Logan just laughed. \u201cGo guard your woman. It will make you less grumpy.\u201d</p><p>Whether or not Andra could be his, being near her still sounded like a good idea, so he took the Sanguinar\u2019s advice and went to her.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Zillah hated being summoned by a child, but he played along because it suited him. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he greeted Maura, bowing low enough to appease her ego. \u201cHow may I serve you?\u201d</p><p>Maura\u2019s pale hair blazed in contrast with the rest of her surroundings. Everything in her personal chambers was a deep, rich red\u2014the color of fresh blood. Velvet drapes lined the chamber, and a thick, soft rug on the floor helped mute the sounds of his voice so it didn\u2019t echo off the cave walls. He felt claustrophobic in here, though none of the smaller rooms seemed to have that effect on him. Odd.</p><p>Perhaps it was the company that he found so stifling.</p><p>Her small, round face sneered up at him in anger. \u201cShe\u2019s done it again,\u201d said Maura.</p><p>Zillah resisted the urge to shake the girl. They needed her too much for him to kill her just now. Soon, but not yet.</p><p>\u201cWho has done what?\u201d he asked in a patient voice, as if he didn\u2019t have a hundred more pressing matters demanding his attention.</p><p>Her ringlets bobbed furiously as she spun on her heel. \u201cAndra Madison. She stole the child I wanted before we even had the chance to bring him here and find out if he was suitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find another,\u201d soothed Zillah. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t upset yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpset myself?\u201d she asked in a deceptively quiet voice.</p><p>Maura stalked toward him, and even though she weighed only about as much as his leg, she still frightened him. There was something inside those black eyes of hers that made him feel cold. Afraid. It didn\u2019t matter that he commanded an army of thousands. It didn\u2019t matter that he wielded more power than all of the unbound Theronai combined. It didn\u2019t even matter that she was a tiny thing he could break with a careless sweep of his hand.</p><p>Maura was powerful in a way he couldn\u2019t begin to understand. She knew . . . things. She could destroy him with as much effort as it took her to blow her dainty nose, and he wouldn\u2019t even see it coming.</p><p>For all he knew, she\u2019d already sealed his fate.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make light of your suffering, my lady. I meant only that all will be well. We will find another child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with his bloodline. There hasn\u2019t been a human child as strong as him born in two centuries. We need that strength if we are to succeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is still time. The girl is only fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I wanted the boy now. We still have time to alter him to suit her,\u201d she said as if he were the child.</p><p>Zillah resisted the urge to slap her, and kept his voice steady. \u201cShall I send another unit to retrieve him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This woman is the one we must stop. Andra. She is the one who keeps stealing my toys. I want her killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lady. It shall be as you wish. I will dispatch troops immediately.\u201d Zillah bowed low, dismissing himself, beyond ready to be out of her company.</p><p>His ploy to leave didn\u2019t work. Maura\u2019s eyes got that glazed look he knew meant she was having a vision.</p><p>The timing was inconvenient, but he had no choice but to stay and learn what she\u2019d seen. These visions were the only reason he put up with her petulance. The only reason he hadn\u2019t fed her to his pets.</p><p>She crumpled to the floor, but Zillah didn\u2019t dare help her. No one touched Maura. Ever.</p><p>She pushed herself up, panting and shaking all over. If he\u2019d had any parental instincts, they would have been blaring in his ear at this moment. But he didn\u2019t. He\u2019d sooner watch her die than give her aid. Since she\u2019d come here, every creature who had touched her died within days, screaming in agony.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been so frail, she would have been a formidable weapon against the Sentinels. Send her in, let her play the role of child and hug them all. An entire compound could be destroyed within days.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d he asked, eager to know and be gone from her presence.</p><p>Maura was pale, and if he hadn\u2019t known she was incapable of it, he would have thought she looked afraid. \u201cForget the boy. There\u2019s another we must find and bring here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnother? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot who. What.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, then?\u201d</p><p>She smoothed the curls away from her doll-like face. \u201cBait. Irresistible bait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d replied Maura with contempt heavy and discordant in her child\u2019s voice. \u201cYou never have.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Logan was sure Paul was occupied with Andra, Logan dialed Tynan, the leader of the Sanguinar.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d answered Tynan.</p><p>\u201cCan you speak?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSammy McMullins was abducted by the Synestryn last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Logan. I know he was one of your more recent successes. You must be desolate. Did you find the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got him back alive.\u201d</p><p>A shocked silence filled the line. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman named Andra Madison. She hunts down lost children. She found him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith his parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the woman?\u201d asked Tynan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in her apartment. With Paul. I believe she\u2019s his lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother woman?\u201d said Tynan in awe. \u201cWhere did she come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still working on that. Her upbringing was fairly normal, but she\u2019s strong. Maybe even as strong as Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you locate her parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer mother is dead. I don\u2019t think she knows much about her father. I wasn\u2019t able to search her mind too deeply with two Theronai standing guard over her. Maybe if I can get her alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you bring her to Dabyr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Tonight. Sibyl has ordered Paul to present her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cIn the meantime, find out what you can about Sammy. I\u2019m going to visit his parents and console them. We don\u2019t want them to worry that this will happen with the child they\u2019re expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she doesn\u2019t know it yet. We\u2019ll let them find out on their own. Our interference will be less obvious that way.\u201d</p><p>Another success. Logan could hardly believe their plan was working. Maybe it was worth all the suffering and hunger they\u2019d been through. \u201cThey\u2019ll need to relocate, just to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. I\u2019ll see if I can convince any of the Slayers to keep watch over the family, too.\u201d</p><p>That notion made Logan\u2019s chest tighten. \u201cWhy? Do you think the Slayers would agree?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, as though Tynan were deciding what to say. Or whether to say anything. \u201cPerhaps. I\u2019ve been . . . negotiating with them. It\u2019s going well.\u201d</p><p>Shock stilled Logan\u2019s body. None of his kind had had dealings with the Slayers since the Theronai declared war upon them. They were a violent, proud, and deadly race of shapeshifters who had long ago turned their backs on humans. They protected their own and kept to themselves. \u201cWhat if the Theronai find out we\u2019re dealing with the Slayers? They won\u2019t like us allying ourselves with their enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019ll never find out. This war is ridiculous, anyway. I refuse to choose sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already did. We chose the Theronai\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because their blood was purer. Not because they were right.\u201d</p><p>Something in what Tynan said set off a warning in Logan\u2019s mind. \u201cYou said the negotiations were going well. What could you possibly have to offer the Slayers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to become involved in Project Lullaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told them about it? Are you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t tell the Theronai. It\u2019s in their best interest to keep our secrets. They need the bloodlines strengthened as badly as we do. Their powers have all but faded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that\u2019s what they wanted. To stop fighting the Synestryn and settle down to life like the humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a shift in power among them. Andreas Phelan has risen to power and has demanded his people return to the old ways or leave the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was only a child when I last saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have changed. For the better.\u201d</p><p>Logan wasn\u2019t so sure, but he had no choice other than to trust Tynan\u2019s leadership until he could learn the truth himself. Besides, it was too late. The Slayers already knew too much, and they were not easy to kill.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d warned Logan. \u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake to risk so many years of effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always careful.\u201d Tynan sounded tired. Weak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have blood to share when I return,\u201d said Logan. He\u2019d rather keep all of the strength Andra had given him to himself, but he couldn\u2019t be that selfish. Survival of his race demanded that he wasn\u2019t. Things would change soon for their people. Project Lullaby would see to that.</p><p>\u201cThank you, brother. It\u2019s sorely needed.\u201d</p><p>Logan heard Madoc\u2019s heavy step coming down the hall toward Andra\u2019s apartment. \u201cI must go.\u201d</p><p>He hung up the phone just before Madoc came in bearing two big sacks of food. He gave Logan a suspicious look, as if he knew about the conversation that had just taken place. Then again, Madoc always looked suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been up to, leech?\u201d</p><p>Logan hated the derogatory term, but he refused to let it show. \u201cJust resting. I always feel weak when the sun is up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. I believe that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreakfast. Lots of it. Hope you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>Madoc wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he could wait for the woman to show. It had taken Logan fucking forever to fall asleep, and Madoc didn\u2019t want the bloodsucker knowing just how bad off he was. No one could know.</p><p>He leaned against the front door of Andra\u2019s apartment, where he\u2019d been waiting for the past twenty minutes. The cool wood eased the burning in his skin, but it did nothing for the rest of him. Pain pulsed inside him, swelling bigger with every beat of his heart.</p><p>Sparks of energy in the air found him and bombarded him, making him want to scream. He couldn\u2019t take any more power. He had to bleed some off. Right. Now.</p><p>Madoc was pretty sure today was the day he was going to die. And if it wasn\u2019t, he was totally sure he didn\u2019t want to know just how much worse he could hurt.</p><p>If only he\u2019d been able to get more fighting in over the past few days, he would have bled off some of his power that way. Or at least not added to the giant pool of energy threatening to shatter him into a bloody mess. But he hadn\u2019t been able to fight until last night. They\u2019d spent too many days driving around looking for Andra so Paul could feel better.</p><p>Fucking pansy.</p><p>Of course, if Andra had been Madoc\u2019s woman, it would have been worth it. He assumed that when his soul started to die, he wouldn\u2019t feel hope anymore. Funny how wrong he\u2019d been. He wasn\u2019t sure if he could still be saved now or not, but he knew that was what he wanted\u2014to end his suffering one way or another.</p><p>In the back of Madoc\u2019s mind, he was still grieving over the fact that he felt no connection to Andra whatsoever.</p><p>Then again, his soul had started dying months ago, and it was getting harder and harder to feel anything. He was one of the Band of the Barren\u2014the secret group of Theronai who no longer bore any leaves on their lifemarks. Their souls were dead, but they helped one another hide it from the other Sentinels, pretending to be normal. If any of the other Sentinels knew, they\u2019d be outcast. Or worse\u2014sent to the Slayers.</p><p>Madoc pressed his palm to his chest where the pressure was the worst. The Band was an invitation-only kind of group, but one of the brothers had recruited him in time to slow the falling of his last leaf. It now hung on his skin midfall, moving too slowly for the eye to see. The other men said that slowing the fall would help him cling to his morals. Or at least pretend well enough to fool the rest of the Sentinels.</p><p>Madoc wasn\u2019t convinced it was working. He was still getting worse by the day.</p><p>Another wave of pressure exploded inside him, nearly ripping him apart. He slid to the ground and pulled himself into a tight ball, hoping that would keep his guts from spewing out his navel. A scream of pain built inside him, but he\u2019d learned long ago not to make a sound. No one outside of the Band of the Barren could know he was lost\u2014no longer one of them.</p><p>A soft knock on the door echoed like salvation in his ears. She was finally here.</p><p>Madoc found the strength to push himself to his feet and open the door. The woman on the other side looked to be in her forties, but was probably a decade younger. She had frizzy blond hair, and last night\u2019s makeup still ringed her dull brown eyes. She wasn\u2019t pretty, but she had on a short skirt and that was enough for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Candi,\u201d she said with a fake smile.</p><p>Madoc pulled her into the apartment and shut the door. \u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d he ground out. His voice was rough with pain, but he didn\u2019t care about that, either.</p><p>There was no real privacy in the small apartment, so he led Candi to the kitchen, which was as good as he could do. Logan was asleep on the couch not far away, but Sanguinar normally slept like the dead during the day.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you the sweet talker?\u201d said Candi.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo fuck you. How much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundred for the straight-up stuff. Kink will cost you extra.\u201d</p><p>Madoc pulled some bills from his wallet and thrust them at her. He wasn\u2019t sure how much it was, but it was more than enough, based on the way her dull eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take good care of you, honey,\u201d she purred.</p><p>Madoc couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He had to have some kind of release for all the pressure grinding inside him. Sex worked better than anything other than hard-core demon slaying.</p><p>He grabbed her hips and turned her around, facing away from him. He really didn\u2019t want to look at her while he used her, though he wasn\u2019t sure why it mattered.</p><p>She grabbed the counter to steady herself, telling him he was being a little rough. So fucking what. She was a professional. She could take it.</p><p>Madoc shoved her short skirt up and her panties down with one hand while he freed his cock with the other. She smelled like drugs and desperation, which would have bothered him at one point in his life. Not anymore. Now, he just didn\u2019t fucking care.</p><p>\u201cSlow down there, big boy. You gotta glove up first.\u201d Candi held a condom over her shoulder.</p><p>Madoc despised the interruption. Pain was pounding on him to fuck her hard and fast, but he knew from experience that putting the thing on was the fastest way to get him what he wanted. He didn\u2019t want her screaming and waking up Logan or Paul.</p><p>He covered himself and used one hand to force her shoulders down to the kitchen counter. She gave a little grunt, but didn\u2019t complain. Madoc shoved his dick inside her and went to work. She started to make sounds as if she were enjoying it.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d he growled at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Candi did.</p><p>Madoc didn\u2019t take long. Maybe forty-five seconds. He shot his wad without making a sound, but Candi was a professional and she knew when a man was finished.</p><p>She straightened, but Madoc pushed her back down. \u201cI\u2019m not done yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate to argue, but I felt you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive me another rubber or I\u2019m going in bareback.\u201d</p><p>Candi snagged another condom out of her bra and handed it to him. Madoc pulled off the used one and tossed it in the trash before rolling the clean one on.</p><p>The whore tried to move, but Madoc\u2019s hips kept her pinned. He was still hard, throbbing as if he hadn\u2019t had a woman in a year. The orgasm hadn\u2019t done much, but at least he didn\u2019t feel like his body was going to rip apart anymore.</p><p>Maybe the next three or four times would make him feel normal again. At least for a while.</p><p>Chapter 5</p> <p>Andra felt like she\u2019d just fallen asleep, but glancing at the clock told her she\u2019d been out for almost twelve hours. At least she was feeling better. Stronger and able to take on all the things that waited for her. Like the child who would no doubt be taken tonight. And if not tonight, then soon. The abductions never stopped.</p><p>It was just starting to get dark outside. The monsters were probably gearing up, planning where to attack.</p><p>Time to get to work.</p><p>She sat up slowly, feeling a bit woozy. She wasn\u2019t sure how much blood Logan had taken, but she hadn\u2019t eaten since, and she was pretty sure that wasn\u2019t great for her blood volume recovery. She eased her legs over the side of the bed and nearly kicked Paul. He knelt on the floor between piles of dirty laundry, beautifully bare chested with his sword in front of him. His eyes were closed, but she sensed he wasn\u2019t asleep. His breathing was too deep and controlled for sleep. He looked like he might be meditating.</p><p>Not wanting to disturb him, she carefully stepped around him on her way to the bathroom, trying to be quiet. She was in the bathroom a few minutes, and when she came out, he still hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>She\u2019d almost made it to the door when Paul\u2019s fingers latched onto her bare ankle, just above her sock. That tingling hum slid up her leg and warmed the insides of her thighs. She let out a rough moan, unable to keep the telling sound from slipping from her.</p> <p>God, his touch felt good. She stood there soaking it in, letting it sink into her flesh and bones and become a part of her. It was more than merely a physical kind of pleasure, though it was that. It was also a sense of contentment\u2014of rightness. When he touched her all the bad things in her life slipped away for just a while, leaving her feeling clean and content. None of her mistakes haunted her here. None of her fears. None of her grief. She was free. Happy.</p><p>His long fingers rubbed over her ankle, sliding a few inches under the hem of her jeans. Another sound of contentment poured from her, and she wished he\u2019d keep creeping those fingers up all the way. If he could make her feel this good by touching her ankle, she could only imagine how much better it would be if he focused on her more sensitive spots.</p><p>She really wanted to find out.</p><p>\u201cLogan was right,\u201d said Paul in a quiet, almost reverent voice. \u201cYou do feel something, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word hissed out of her. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have let him know the kind of power he held over her, but she didn\u2019t care. Not now. She was willing to give him almost anything, and the truth was easy to give.</p><p>He took her hand and rose from his kneeling position. She missed his touch at her ankle, but she forgave him as soon as his fingers traced a gentle line over her cheek.</p><p>Andra shivered, and it made Paul\u2019s brown eyes darken with satisfaction. She leaned into his touch, unable to stop herself. \u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked, sounding pleased, as if he already knew the answer.</p> <p>She watched his mouth move. It was a nice mouth\u2014soft-looking, with a full bottom lip that made her want to nibble at it. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t stop. The closer we are, the easier it will be for you.\u201d</p><p>Andra didn\u2019t know what he meant by that. She was too busy deciding that she was going to kiss him. Sure, she didn\u2019t really know him, and yes, he carried a sword and killed monsters, but that wasn\u2019t part of the whole deciding-to-kiss-him equation. It was simply a matter of needing to see if he tasted as good as he felt.</p><p>She threaded her hands into his soft, mussed hair and went up on tiptoe. He didn\u2019t try to stop her. In fact, he met her halfway.</p><p>Her lips touched his and the rest of the world ceased to exist. His mouth was smooth and firm. Perfect. He didn\u2019t try to rush her or shove his tongue into her mouth like so many men did. Instead, he let her take her time while she learned the feel of him. She flicked her tongue out and tasted just the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Paul let out a low rumble of appreciation and pulled her body hard against his own. She could feel the muscles of his chest and abs, so beautifully defined. But even more distracting, she could feel his erection through their jeans, big and hard and ready for her.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening,\u201d she breathed. \u201cNothing this good is real.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slid under her shirt and splayed across her bare back. \u201cFeels pretty real to me.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him again, sucking his full lower lip into her mouth. His fingers clenched against her back, telling her just how much he liked it.</p><p>Good, because she wasn\u2019t anywhere close to being through with him. There was a bed only two feet away and it was already a wreck anyway. Might as well make good use of it.</p><p>Andra maneuvered him back until his legs hit the side of her bed, but he didn\u2019t go down, as she\u2019d hoped. He was too strong and solid for her to push around unless he allowed it, and right now, he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>She lifted her mouth from his and looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not interested.\u201d Just saying the words nearly made her scream. Her body was primed, slick, and ready to take him on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than just interested. I\u2019m just not sure this is smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s not smart. I don\u2019t even know you. I don\u2019t normally screw strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. This isn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Whoever was in the driver\u2019s seat of her body, it wasn\u2019t her. Something else was going on here. Something freaky.</p><p>Still, her body was humming and hot for him, and she didn\u2019t think she was strong enough to pull away. Not when she knew bleak reality was out there waiting for her. This was so much better.</p><p>She kissed him again, tasting him, allowing him to do the same. Their tongues mingled, making her dizzy. She sagged against him, but Paul held her up, taking her weight easily.</p><p>When he pulled his mouth away he was breathing hard. \u201cI\u2019m stopping this now. Before I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to scare you away.\u201d He set her on the bed, but didn\u2019t go far, as if he were afraid she might pass out or something.</p><p>When another wave of dizziness washed over her, she didn\u2019t think that was such a bad idea. That needy haze was fading, but this time it didn\u2019t disappear. Not entirely. She was right on eye level with the impressive bulge in his jeans, and there wasn\u2019t a red-blooded woman out there who wouldn\u2019t have been a little awed by a sight like that.</p><p>He wanted her, and the proof of it thrilled her down to her toes.</p><p>Andra had to stop staring. She flopped back onto the bed and covered her eyes with her forearm. The sudden motion spun her head around until she thought she might throw up.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that turn him on?</p><p>Now that she was no longer touching him, she wasn\u2019t feeling so hot. In fact, she felt more than just a little ill. Her joints ached and her eyes burned like she had a fever.</p><p>Too bad. There wasn\u2019t time to be sick. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get some water or something. I think Logan might have taken a little more than a pint.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see him, but she could practically feel the vibration of his anger filling the room. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Andra waved her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Just need some juice and cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc ordered some pizza. You interested?\u201d</p><p>The idea of food turned her stomach, but she knew she\u2019d feel better if she managed to choke something down. \u201cPizza works as well as anything. Give me a sec and I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t take Paul\u2019s hand when he offered to help her off the bed. He scowled, but he could just keep on scowling. As much as she enjoyed the way he made her feel, she had more important things to worry about. So did he.</p><p>Night was coming.</p><p>Andra\u2019s phone rang and she thanked it for the distraction. She pushed herself from the bed without any help, thank you, and scooped it up. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndra, this is Melanie at Twin Oaks Hospital. I think you should come over here immediately.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was high-pitched, nearly frantic. Something terrible had happened.</p><p>Andra locked her knees to keep from sinking to the floor in fear. So many horrible things flashed through her mind. Nika was so fragile. She could be hurt so easily. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Melanie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said not to bother you, that she\u2019d deal with it, but I knew you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Please, God, let Nika be okay. Andra didn\u2019t think she could bear to lose another sister.</p><p>\u201cNika\u2019s gotten worse. Much worse.\u201d</p><p>Part of Andra was relieved that she was still alive, while the rest of her was seething with rage. Why hadn\u2019t they called sooner? \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Her deterioration seems way too sudden,\u201d said Melanie. \u201cI really think you should come. She needs you.\u201d</p><p>Paul watched Andra\u2019s face drain of blood. Whoever was on that phone had scared her more than demons charging her with claws extended and teeth bared. He couldn\u2019t hear what was being said on the other end, but he didn\u2019t have to hear it to know it was bad.</p><p>He crossed the distance between them, making sure he was close enough to catch her if she passed out or something. She looked as if she were on the verge of doing just that.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>The phone fell from Andra\u2019s fingers. She looked vulnerable. Afraid.</p><p>Paul moved to put his arm around her, but she flinched away from his touch.</p><p>Just like Kate had done so many times.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to happen again. Not with Andra.</p><p>She headed out of the bedroom and he was right on her heels, refusing to let her get away from him.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Logan was sleeping on the couch and woke at the noise. Madoc was watching professional wrestling and pumping iron on Andra\u2019s impressive weight bench. He shot Paul a questioning look and Paul gave him a hell-if-I-know shrug.</p><p>Andra stopped in the kitchen and started rummaging through stacks of papers and mail. A bright sheen of tears filled her eyes, but she blinked several times to clear it. \u201cI, uh, need to go. It\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat emergency?\u201d</p><p>Her movements grew more frantic and she started throwing mail to the floor as she searched for something. \u201cI just have to go,\u201d she said. \u201cLock up when you leave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was trembling. Pale. That stone-hard confidence he\u2019d seen earlier was gone now, leaving her looking shattered and afraid. Paul wanted to drag her into his arms, but he didn\u2019t dare touch her. He had to remember that she was only cooperating with him because he\u2019d offered to pay her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you,\u201d he told her. He didn\u2019t think she was in any shape to drive safely. Besides, whatever this was, he wanted to be there for her. Just in case she needed help. He worked for free. \u201cLet me drive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. You can stay here if you want. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d She yanked a paper towel off the roll and scrubbed at her wet eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnything I can do?\u201d asked Madoc, looking a little too hopeful for Paul\u2019s peace of mind.</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen my keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Without anything else to do to help her, Paul started looking for her keys, too. \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on. Maybe I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the thought, but there\u2019s nothing you can do but get out of my way so I can find my damn keys.\u201d Her voice caught on a sob, which she tried, and failed, to hide.</p><p>Paul couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. He had to comfort her. Help her. Something.</p> <p>He took her by the arm to turn her around, and the second his palm touched her skin he was swamped with feelings of physical pleasure. He sucked in his breath against the force of it. His body tingled. Sang with joy. Every cell inside him was doing a happy little dance that made him want to bust out in laughter. So much of his life had been spent in pain that he\u2019d forgotten what it was like to live without it.</p><p>Andra\u2019s blue eyes widened and she stared at him in shock. Her pupils dilated and her gaze lowered to his mouth.</p><p>And then it hit him\u2014a surge of lust that crashed into him and swept him along for the ride. His body hardened so fast it hurt, but even that hurt was a kind of pleasure. His skin grew warm and his blood swelled in his veins. His mouth watered for a taste of her, and his fingers tightened against her skin, seeking closer contact.</p><p>Her lips parted as she drew in a startled breath, and he knew he had to kiss her. He was going to force her to open her mouth and let him taste her, and he wasn\u2019t going to stop there. He was going to lay her out on the floor and taste every swath of smooth skin, every sweet hollow and curve. He was going to strip her bare and make her his in the most basic, primitive way he knew.</p><p>Mine, his soul screamed, and he knew that if he moved even one inch toward her lips, he\u2019d be lost\u2014unable to stop no matter what she wanted, no matter what emergency she had to deal with. Nothing else in her life could possibly be more important than his need for her.</p><p>And that truth poured over him like icy water, dousing his lust until it was only a smoldering pile of longing.</p> <p>With careful motions, Paul loosened his grasp on Andra and moved his hand away. Losing contact with her left him burning and stinging all over, but he rejoiced in that pain. It meant there was hope\u2014hope that Andra was the woman who could save him.</p><p>Now Paul was the one who was shaking.</p><p>Andra rubbed her hands over the place where he\u2019d held her shoulders and looked at him with a mix of confusion and fear. \u201cNever again,\u201d she told him. \u201cDon\u2019t ever touch me again.\u201d</p><p>Not fucking likely, but he kept his mouth prudently shut and continued his search for her keys. He found them hiding under the lid of an open pizza box and dangled them in front of her. \u201cYou\u2019re in no shape to drive. At least let me take you wherever you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and he could sense her indecision, so he went in for the kill. \u201cWhatever it is, you can\u2019t fix it if you crash on the way there.\u201d</p><p>When her shoulders slumped, he knew he\u2019d won. \u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t drive fast enough, I\u2019m throwing you out of my truck.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Andra leaped out of the truck as soon as they reached the psychiatric hospital, leaving Paul to find a place to park. The staff at the front desk must have known she was on her way, because they were waiting for her with a visitor badge as soon as she slammed through the front door.</p> <p>The smells of disinfectant and sorrow clung to the walls of this place, but it was better than the rest of the mental hospitals she\u2019d seen. They charged an arm and a leg for Nika to stay here, but at least they took good care of her. Andra showed up randomly every couple of weeks in addition to her normal weekly visits, and never once in eight years had she seen any signs of mistreatment of the patients. They were clean and resting as calmly as they were able, considering.</p><p>Melanie met Andra in the hall outside Nika\u2019s room. She was somewhere in her late forties with smooth, dark skin and huge eyes. The woman never smiled, but she conveyed comfort with the smallest touch of her pudgy hand.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what else to do but call you,\u201d said Melanie. \u201cMy last shift was only two days ago, but I swear she wasn\u2019t so thin then. And no one else seems to see it. None of the doctors listen when I tell them she needs to be put on a feeding tube. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t even see that she\u2019s wasting away.\u201d</p><p>Andra knew that Nika had a tendency to go days without eating, but it never lasted. The doctors said it would be more harmful to force her than to let her get hungry enough that her body\u2019s needs overcame her mind\u2019s imaginary fears.</p><p>Andra reached for the door, but Melanie stopped her. \u201cWe had to restrain her today. She hasn\u2019t had enough to drink, and we had to give her an IV to keep her hydrated. She kept pulling it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hates to be restrained,\u201d said Andra. Anger burned in her chest, a welcome relief from the constant grief she felt for her sister.</p><p>\u201cI know, honey, but it was for her own good. She kept hurting herself, tearing open her veins. We got the bleeding stopped, but we can\u2019t take any more chances. She\u2019s already so weak. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019d be able to fight off an infection right now.\u201d</p><p>Melanie was right. Poor Nika was so delusional that they had to do whatever was necessary to protect her. Keep her safe.</p><p>In the back of Andra\u2019s mind, she wondered if keeping Nika alive wasn\u2019t just a cruel form of torture. Maybe it would be kinder to let her go. Let her slip away from the fear and misery that were her life.</p><p>If Andra had been a stronger person, maybe she would have done just that. But she wasn\u2019t. She was weak and selfish. She\u2019d already let one sister die. She couldn\u2019t let that happen to the other one. She needed Nika to live.</p><p>Andra put her hand on the door and prayed for strength.</p><p>Melanie gave Andra a quick hug. \u201cYou need to know that there\u2019s some blood on her gown. We normally would have changed her, but it caused her so much distress that we just let her be. Fresh clothes can wait for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded and opened the door to Nika\u2019s room.</p><p>She\u2019d seen Nika in distress before, but nothing could have prepared her for the wild look of fear in her sister\u2019s eyes. She was fighting against the restraints that held her in the hospital bed. Angry purple bruises marred her arms where the IVs had been ripped out. Her white nightgown was splattered with drops of blood, and the woman beneath the gown had become dangerously thinner than she\u2019d been only four days ago. Her face was gaunt, her pale blue eyes sunken and fever-bright with terror. She cried fat tears that soaked the white hair at her temples.</p><p>Andra bit back a wail of grief. Poor Nika. So lost in her own world of nightmares. Nothing Andra had done had ever helped.</p><p>Andra swallowed her tears and went to her sister.</p><p>Paul saw Logan and Madoc pull into the parking lot behind him. Madoc was driving, and Paul went to his window. \u201cYou coming in?\u201d</p><p>Logan was in the back, covered up to prevent the last few rays of sunlight from touching his skin. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTwin Oaks Hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a psychiatric facility,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Andra\u2019s in there with a bunch of crazies.\u201d Paul really didn\u2019t care for the notion, and itched to get back to her side, where he could keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cAny idea why we\u2019re here?\u201d asked Madoc.</p><p>\u201cNone. She wouldn\u2019t say a thing on the drive over. Except to tell me to drive faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll leave this to you, man. I\u2019m more likely to scare the people in there than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Sit tight. I\u2019ll call you when I know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>It took a little fast-talking to convince the woman at the front desk to let him enter the mental hospital, but Paul managed to win his way inside. A burly orderly es corted him to the room where Andra had gone, and he silently slipped inside.</p><p>Andra sat beside the bed holding the hand of a frail young woman with striking white hair. The woman thrashed on the bed, fighting the restraints that held her in place. A series of pitiful moans filled the room, echoing off the stark walls.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Nika,\u201d soothed Andra, stroking the woman\u2019s pale hair back from her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m here now. You\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Nika began to calm down, though whether it was from Andra\u2019s words or sheer exhaustion, Paul had no idea.</p><p>As soon as Nika relaxed and saw Andra was there, the glazed look of fear faded from the woman\u2019s delicate features. She was maybe twenty, and though her hair was white where Andra\u2019s was brown, there was no mistaking the family resemblance in their faces. They had the same full lips, high cheekbones, and bright blue eyes\u2014like a clear winter sky. Nika was much thinner than Andra, even to the point of being gaunt, and it gave her a fragile, ethereal appearance that contrasted harshly with Andra\u2019s healthy strength.</p><p>Paul itched to know the relationship between them, but didn\u2019t dare ask. He felt desperation in the room\u2014a subtle thrumming of frantic energy that did not dissipate. It was coming from Nika, almost as if she had fought her way through her insanity because Andra was here. He wouldn\u2019t do anything to jeopardize that.</p><p>\u201cAndra?\u201d asked the younger woman. Her voice was raw from screaming and faint with fatigue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Nika. Right here.\u201d</p><p>Nika\u2019s body went limp, and she stopped trying to fight the restraints. \u201cPlease make them let me go. I can\u2019t stand being chained down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not chained down, honey. They put these restraints on you to keep you from pulling out the IV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t pull it out. I promise.\u201d Tears welled in Nika\u2019s eyes as they pleaded for freedom.</p><p>Andra looked at the nurse who was standing unobtrusively in the corner of the room. \u201cI\u2019m letting her up,\u201d she told the nurse.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d said the nurse.</p><p>Andra ignored the advice and started to unfasten the restraints around Nika\u2019s arms. \u201cShe\u2019s not fighting anymore, and I can\u2019t stand to see her like this.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Nika was free, she sat up and grabbed Andra around the neck in a fierce hug. She looked small next to Andra. Almost childlike. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. I tried to call out to you, but you couldn\u2019t hear me,\u201d said Nika. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paul felt Andra tense more than he saw it. \u201cAll you have to do is use the phone or have one of the nurses call. I\u2019ll always come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were no phones where I was, Andra. I swear it. I\u2019m not making it up.\u201d</p><p>Andra smoothed Nika\u2019s white hair away from her face and wiped the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI know you\u2019re not lying. It\u2019s all right.\u201d She helped Nika lie back down and climbed into the bed beside her, pulling the frail woman into her arms. \u201cThey told me you aren\u2019t eating,\u201d said Andra without accusation.</p><p>Nika swallowed. \u201cI try, but I can\u2019t. All she gets to eat is black blood. It burns like acid. How can I eat food when all she gets is blood?\u201d</p> <p>Paul had no idea who \u201cshe\u201d was, but apparently Andra did. \u201cNo one is feeding her blood, Nika. It\u2019s just a trick of your mind. You have to eat.\u201d</p><p>Nika shook her head. \u201cI try, but all I taste is the blood and it makes me sick.\u201d</p><p>Andra was quiet for a while, just running a soothing hand over the woman\u2019s hair. \u201cDo you want them to find another way to feed you? Maybe put a tube into your stomach so you won\u2019t feel sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Nika tried to lurch up, but Andra\u2019s stronger body easily held her down. \u201cNo, no, no. No tubes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d said Andra in a placating tone. \u201cNo tubes. But you have to eat. Will you at least try?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs not real. It\u2019s a trick.\u201d Andra looked over at the nurse as if deciding whether or not to trust her.</p><p>The astute nurse saw the look and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go get a tray.\u201d Then she left, eyeing Paul curiously as she passed him.</p><p>Once the nurse was gone, Andra said, \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this before. The monsters like to play tricks on you. They make you think things are real. No one is going to feed blood to anyone here. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Nika grabbed Andra\u2019s hand and squeezed hard with skeletal fingers. \u201cI\u2019m safe, but Tori isn\u2019t. They keep hurting her. Putting things inside her. Changing her. She\u2019s so afraid, Andra.\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s chin trembled for a moment before she controlled it. Only the brightness of her eyes gave away her grief. \u201cTori is not afraid anymore. She\u2019s dead, Nika. Up in heaven with Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not! The monsters have her. They\u2019re doing something to her to make her . . . different. We have to find her soon or it will be too late.\u201d</p><p>Paul saw anguish tighten Andra\u2019s body, though her expression remained calm. No doubt for Nika\u2019s sake. \u201cPlease, honey, try not to worry about Tori. Nothing can ever hurt her again.\u201d</p><p>The nurse returned with a tray of food and placed it on the table beside the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll come back in a few minutes. Do you need anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll be fine, Melanie. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>The nurse left and Andra pulled the metal cover off the tray of food. \u201cLooks like some chicken soup and runny mashed potatoes. Which sounds better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the potatoes. Too thick. Too much like . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet that thought out of your mind. Focus on me. Tell me what you\u2019ve been drawing lately.\u201d Andra tested the temperature of the soup on her own lips before holding the spoon to Nika\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Nika closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and opened her mouth. Andra poured a tiny portion of soup over her tongue, and immediately Nika began to shake. Her body quivered and tears streamed down her face. Paul could see the effort she was making to swallow the soup, but it wasn\u2019t working. The poor girl\u2019s mind was too damaged, and she couldn\u2019t separate real food from the black blood of her delusions.</p> <p>Nika grabbed the napkin and spit out the soup. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Andra. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Andra pushed the table away and wrapped her arms around Nika. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You tried. We\u2019ll try again in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Andra turned her attention to Paul. He expected her to look at him with anger for spying on them, but instead, her eyes were imploring. \u201cCan you help her like you did Sammy?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Paul stepped forward slowly so he wouldn\u2019t frighten Nika. \u201cHow long has she been this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight years.\u201d</p><p>Paul had no idea how she\u2019d survived so long. Most people didn\u2019t last a year after being touched by the Synestryn. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long. I don\u2019t think I can help, but I might be able to help you to get her to eat. But it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>Paul looked at Nika, who was watching him with wide, frightened eyes. \u201cCan I come closer?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Nika looked to Andra, who said, \u201cHe\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>Nika nodded and Paul moved slowly to Andra\u2019s side. \u201cGive me your hand,\u201d he told Andra, holding out his left hand, which pulsed with the iridescent ring of the Theronai.</p><p>Andra obeyed and he felt her tense right before that wave of pleasure rolled through them both at the contact. He saw her eyes dilate and her nipples bead up under the thin fabric of her shirt. He had to fight to keep from pulling her up against him, or better yet, throwing her down on the bed, where he could stretch her out and spend his time tasting her.</p><p>Then he remembered Nika was on that bed and she needed them both to focus. Paul shoved down all those inappropriately lustful feelings and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cJust hang on to me. Put your hand on Nika\u2019s head. Concentrate on the skin that links us. Open yourself up and don\u2019t fight what happens. I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>Paul had no access to the earth, so he focused on the air. He pulled from it tiny sparks of power no larger than motes of dust. He\u2019d pushed himself hard recently, and hadn\u2019t meditated nearly long enough. His body tried to reject the power\u2014to push it away so that he wouldn\u2019t have to suffer. Paul took control of his self-preservation instincts and forced them to yield. To accept the pain. He knew he didn\u2019t have much strength, and even less time, but he prayed it would be enough to give Nika a chance.</p><p>Rather than trying to make a connection with Nika, he used the connection that Andra already had. They knew each other. Trusted each other. Nothing he could say would ever outdo that trust. He let his energy flow through her hand, into her arm, across her chest, down her other arm, and into Nika.</p><p>Andra tensed and hissed in a pained breath. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, struggling against his own pain.</p><p>\u201cJust hurry,\u201d she said.</p><p>Paul did. He gave up on finesse and forced his power through their skin-on-skin connection until he touched Nika\u2019s mind. As soon as he did, he jerked back, reeling from the dark agony the woman suffered. He\u2019d never seen anything like it, and he hoped he never would again. She was human on the outside, but inside, she was a writhing mass of Synestryn-inflicted torment. He had no idea how she could stand the suffering. It was no wonder the poor thing couldn\u2019t eat. He wasn\u2019t sure that he would even be able to stay conscious if he had to live with that level of torment. And Paul knew torment.</p><p>There was no way he was going to be able to wade into her mind with his limited ability. He feared doing even greater damage. All he could hope for was to shut down the horror long enough to get some food into the woman. So that was what he did. He willed her mind to sleep while her body stayed awake. He shut down her consciousness with harsh, unyielding commands.</p><p>Paul pulled away from Nika as quickly as possible. His body was covered in a layer of cold sweat and he was shaking. Even with Andra\u2019s touch, that had been torture.</p><p>Nika was broken. Irrevocably.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d cried Andra. \u201cHow can she live with that?\u201d</p><p>Paul forced his weary neck to lift his head. \u201cYou saw inside her mind?\u201d It wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>\u201cNo, I felt your horror. Your pity for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d be able to do that. If I\u2019d known\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll survive,\u201d said Andra, her tone bleak and accepting. \u201cDid it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Try to feed her now, but go slow. Her mind is asleep, so she won\u2019t be able to pay attention to what you\u2019re doing. She\u2019ll choke if you go too fast.\u201d</p><p>Andra lifted the spoon again, and this time Nika swallowed the soup. \u201cIt\u2019s working,\u201d she said, giving him a relieved smile.</p><p>Paul\u2019s gut tightened in reaction. It was the first time he\u2019d seen her smile, and he couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing anything more beautiful. He\u2019d spend eternity trying to make her smile again, given the chance.</p><p>Paul\u2019s cell phone buzzed\u2014a timely warning against his train of thought. \u201cI\u2019ll take this in the hall,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He stepped outside and answered the phone. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound something you should know,\u201d said Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat account you had me transfer funds into? Turns out it\u2019s part of a trust of some kind set up to pay the medical bills for a woman named Nika Madison. Does that make any sense?\u201d</p><p>Paul looked back toward the door to Nika\u2019s room. A private room in a place like this couldn\u2019t be cheap. It was nice here. Quiet, upscale, well managed. Oh, yeah, this place would definitely cost a fortune.</p><p>An odd sort of relief washed through him at the news. Andra was not the money-hungry woman he\u2019d feared. She was protecting Nika.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Paul said into the phone. \u201cIt makes perfect sense.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Andra got nearly all the food into Nika before she just lay down and closed her eyes.</p><p>She breathed out a relieved sigh and wiped a smudge of mashed potatoes from the corner of Nika\u2019s mouth. She\u2019d never seen anything like this before, but then again, she was beginning to think there were a whole lot of things she\u2019d never seen. Paul and his friends topped that list.</p><p>Melanie slipped into the room and eyed the empty containers. \u201cYou got her to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul helped,\u201d she said, just as he stepped back into the room.</p><p>\u201cYour fianc\u00e9 is a nice guy and a hunk? You really lucked out to find a man like that to marry. Shame on you for not telling me you\u2019re engaged. I didn\u2019t even know you were dating seriously.\u201d</p><p>Fianc\u00e9? She opened her mouth to refute it, but before she could, Paul said, \u201cWe only met recently, but when it\u2019s true love, why wait around?\u201d</p><p>Melanie watched Andra carefully, as if waiting for her side of the story. After what he\u2019d done for Nika, she wasn\u2019t about to go calling him a liar in front of Melanie. In fact, she wanted to throw herself at him in thanks for what he\u2019d done. Instead, she reached out and took Paul\u2019s hand. Warm, tingling pleasure swamped her limbs and she had to work to stifle a shiver.</p><p>Her reaction must have been enough to convince Melanie, because she just grinned, congratulated the two of them on their impending marriage, and left the room with the empty tray.</p><p>Andra tried to pull her hand away so she could think straight, but Paul didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cFianc\u00e9?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI had to get past the front desk somehow.\u201d He grinned and she was glad to see it. Ever since she\u2019d asked him for the money, he\u2019d looked at her like she\u2019d committed some heinous crime, and until now, she hadn\u2019t realized how much his bad opinion had bothered her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cI seem to be telling you that a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He looked to where Nika was sleeping. \u201cDo you mind telling me who she is?\u201d</p><p>Andra hesitated. She didn\u2019t know this man, and yet he\u2019d just finished suffering in order to help the only person on this earth Andra loved. She owed him more than she could ever repay. \u201cMy sister.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes widened with a desperate kind of hope. \u201cForgive me if this is rude, but do you share both of the same parents?\u201d</p> <p>Andra was so shocked by the odd question that she didn\u2019t even consider whether or not she should answer. \u201cI think so. Mom had a boyfriend who would come visit her every few years. We never met him, but she loved him. She said he was in the military and that\u2019s why we never got to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the military?\u201d</p><p>Andra shrugged, refusing to let the hurt of her childhood rule her life now. \u201cI think it was a cover story Mom made up so we wouldn\u2019t hate him. I believed it for a few years, but eventually I started to resent him. What the hell kind of father couldn\u2019t even send a birthday card or call on the phone once in a while? I think he was just some deadbeat who got Mom pregnant and left her to deal with things on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a real winner,\u201d said Paul, but there was no fire in his tone, only speculation.</p><p>\u201cI figure my life was better without him in it, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, but it didn\u2019t sound like he believed it for a minute.</p><p>\u201cDo you know something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout your father? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Nika let out a whimper in her sleep and Andra went to her side. \u201cShh, baby. Sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d mumbled Nika. \u201cThe monsters are coming.\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s heart broke open and wept for her sister. \u201cYou\u2019re safe here. I won\u2019t let anything hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>The door to the room opened and Logan and Madoc walked in as if they owned the place. Andra was starting to question the security here. \u201cHow did you two get in?\u201d</p><p>Logan ignored her question. He was too busy sniffing the air for something. Madoc shrugged his huge shoulders and said, \u201cOnce the sun set, Logan pulled his Invisible Man routine and we walked right in. No sweat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe actually went invisible?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said Logan. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a trick of the mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the kid?\u201d asked Madoc. He stared at Nika with way too much interest for Andra\u2019s comfort.</p><p>Andra took a step to the side to block his line of sight. \u201cI think you all should leave.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s pale eyes brightened and he moved toward Nika as if he were floating. \u201cYou never said you had a sister.\u201d He pulled in a deep breath through his nose. \u201cHer blood is as pure as yours. I can smell it.\u201d</p><p>Andra saw the dark spots of blood on Nika\u2019s gown. \u201cYou can smell that we\u2019re sisters?\u201d That was too freaky for words.</p> <p>\u201cLogan,\u201d said Paul in a warning tone. \u201cBack the hell off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in so much pain. I mean only to ease her mind.\u201d He reached toward Nika.</p><p>The metallic ring of metal on metal filled the air as both Paul and Madoc drew their swords, seemingly from thin air. Paul\u2019s sword went to Logan\u2019s throat, Madoc\u2019s to Logan\u2019s crotch.</p><p>\u201cTouch her and die the hard way,\u201d growled Madoc.</p><p>Logan lifted his elegant hands into the air and the unnatural light in his eyes dimmed. \u201cThe child is suffering. I can help.\u201d</p><p>Andra wasn\u2019t sure what was going on. \u201cCan he really help her?\u201d Andra asked Paul.</p><p>Paul spared Andra a quick glance. \u201cHe\u2019d want to drink her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to diagnose her\u2014to find the true cause of her mental breakdown,\u201d explained Logan.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall for it, Andra,\u201d said Madoc. \u201cYou saw the way he looked at her. He wants her blood, and he\u2019s using the excuse of helping her as a way to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not entirely true. I do want her blood, but I also want to help her. Just let me near her to see if I can give her any comfort.\u201d</p><p>Andra had given the vampire her blood and it hadn\u2019t hurt her, other than a case of the woozies. He\u2019d mended her broken arm, too. If he could help Nika, she was willing to take a risk and let him near her. \u201cYou can look at her, but you can\u2019t do anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d agreed Logan.</p><p>Madoc didn\u2019t want to put his sword away. He was probably going to need it any second now anyway. Logan was a fucking predator, and he seemed to be the only one who saw that.</p><p>Madoc didn\u2019t like the idea of Logan getting anywhere near the child. He couldn\u2019t see her face from here, but she barely made a bump in the bed, she was so thin. Only the bones in her knees and her toes stuck out enough to tent the blanket.</p><p>Logan glided forward and Andra stepped aside to make room for him by the bed. Madoc got a glimpse at the girl\u2019s face and realized that this was no child. She was a young woman, much older than the ten or twelve he would have guessed from her scrawny frame.</p><p>The woman stirred and Andra laid a hand on her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Nika. He\u2019s here to help.\u201d</p><p>Madoc snorted in disgust. He couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cThe only person Logan is going to help is Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, Madoc,\u201d said Paul. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to hurt her by looking at her.\u201d</p><p>Logan placed his hand on Nika\u2019s head. Just as he did, Nika opened her eyes as if someone had flipped a switch. Her skin was deathly pale, nearly as white as her hair. Her eyes were wide with fear, and a pure, brilliant blue like the winter sky. And there was so much blue, too. Her pupils had shrunk down to pinpoints.</p><p>She swatted Logan\u2019s hand away and scrambled away from him, huddling into a small space against the far railing of the bed. The IV bag swayed on the stand as her flailing swung the tube around.</p><p>\u201cHe wants my blood,\u201d she whispered, staring at Logan in terror. \u201cHe wants my blood, he wants my blood, he wants my blood.\u201d Over and over again, her words getting higher and more strained each time.</p><p>Andra rushed around the bed to soothe her sister. Madoc decided Logan\u2019s time with the woman was at an end. He grabbed the Sanguinar\u2019s thin body around the middle with one arm and hauled him across the room. He shoved him into the bathroom, shut the door, and held the knob so Logan couldn\u2019t come out until he let him.</p><p>The door rattled as Logan pulled against Madoc\u2019s hold, but it didn\u2019t budge. Logan was no wimp, but Madoc was a whole hell of a lot stronger.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t helping,\u201d he said from the other side of the door.</p><p>As a matter of fact, it was. Nika had quieted, and was now clinging to Andra\u2019s neck, sobbing. Madoc didn\u2019t care much for the tears, but they beat the hell out of that frightened look on her face\u2014the one that made him want to kill something to make it stop.</p><p>Paul shot Madoc a sour look. \u201cHe\u2019s right, you know. He can\u2019t help her at all from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl didn\u2019t want his help,\u201d said Madoc. \u201cJust ask her.\u201d</p><p>Paul crossed to Madoc and spoke in a near whisper. \u201cShe\u2019s not sane. Logan scared her. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want him to take her blood. Far as I\u2019m concerned, that makes her the sanest person in this room.\u201d</p><p>Paul shook his head and turned around. \u201cWhat do you want to do, Andra?\u201d</p><p>She looked up from their hug. Tears were running down her face, and her eyes\u2014so much like Nika\u2019s\u2014were filled with sorrow.</p><p>Something about seeing that pulled at Madoc. He would have thought it was sympathy, but surely he had none left.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand to see her upset like that. It\u2019s going to make her sick after we finally got her to eat something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d said Paul. \u201cHow about we wait until she calms down and tell her what\u2019s going on. Maybe if she knows who Logan is, she won\u2019t be so afraid of him. She wasn\u2019t afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t want to drink her blood, idiot,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>Andra sniffed and nodded, ignoring him altogether. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe monsters are coming,\u201d said Nika. Her voice broke as she spoke, and Madoc had the nearly uncontrollable urge to go visit Logan in the bathroom and pound on him for a while.</p><p>\u201cShh, baby. No monsters can get you here,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>Nika lifted her tearstained face. Her cheekbones stood out under her skin. \u201cThey know where I am now. They see me. And you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. You\u2019re safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy, Andra. They\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>Chick didn\u2019t sound crazy. Sad, afraid, tired, sure. But not crazy.</p><p>Madoc looked out the window onto the green lawn below. It was well lit down there, and he didn\u2019t see anything, but that didn\u2019t mean shit. \u201cThere\u2019s blood on her gown,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she is one of us, they might be able to smell it.\u201d</p><p>Nika turned her head and looked at him for the first time. When her eyes met his, he felt like he\u2019d been hit in the gut with a battering ram. He grabbed the doorframe to steady himself.</p><p>Whoever she was, she had power. He could almost see it flowing through her.</p><p>Killing her.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how he knew that was the case, but he knew it, deep down. Bone deep. The same way he knew his soul was shriveling up into a heap of ash more and more as each day passed, and there wasn\u2019t a fucking thing he could do about it.</p><p>Logan opened the door behind him. Madoc moved so Nika couldn\u2019t see the bloodsucker.</p><p>\u201cHer natural protection should mask the scent of her blood from the Synestryn,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>\u201cNot if she knows about them.\u201d</p><p>Paul asked Andra, \u201cDoes Nika know about the Synestryn?\u201d</p><p>Andra gave a shaky nod. \u201cThey attacked us when we were kids.\u201d</p><p>Logan pulled in a deep breath, sniffing the air. \u201cNi ka\u2019s right. Synestryn are closing in. Fast.\u201d</p><p>Madoc righted himself and let the grin fill his face. Finally, something he could kill.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>Andra held her sister\u2019s face against her chest. \u201cNot without Nika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Can you carry her?\u201d Paul asked Andra.</p><p>She nodded and unhooked the clear bag of fluid from the stand. \u201cCome on, Nika. You and I are going for a ride.\u201d She handed her sister the bag and lifted her into strong arms.</p><p>Andra was ripped, and Madoc took a moment to enjoy the sight before drawing his weapon. \u201cI\u2019ll take point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring up the rear,\u201d said Paul. \u201cLogan. You\u2019re going to have to shield us all from sight. Are you strong enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Logan, though he didn\u2019t sound convincing. He was sticking close to Paul now, as if worried he might need a bodyguard.</p><p>Smart leech.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll need to leave the bloody gown behind,\u201d said Logan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll of you turn around,\u201d ordered Andra.</p><p>Madoc did, making sure the others had as well. He heard a drawer open and close and the soft rustle of fabric. Then a sgath howl split the night, loud enough that Madoc could hear it through the thick glass. The Synestryn were close.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done,\u201d said Andra. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Madoc rolled his shoulders and headed out the door, ready to kick ass.</p> <p>Andra held Nika close as they raced out of the building. Amazingly, no one seemed to notice their passage. It was as if they were invisible, just as Madoc had said. Not only that, but the guards had opened each door for them without having been asked. She had no idea what to think of that except that Logan must be using some weird mind-control mojo. It was best if she didn\u2019t spend too much time thinking about just what he could do with that kind of power.</p><p>Nika clung to her with weak arms, trembling and hiding her face against Andra\u2019s neck. She was covered in a clean nightgown now, but Andra had seen what had become of her sister\u2019s body when she\u2019d helped her change. Poor Nika\u2019s body was a skeleton covered by loose, pale skin. Her belly was sunken and her ribs and hip bones protruded grotesquely, breaking Andra\u2019s heart. The only recognizable thing about her body was the ringshaped birthmark on her left shoulder\u2014the same one that graced Andra\u2019s calf.</p><p>It had taken every ounce of willpower Andra had to not break down into tears at the sight of her sister\u2019s wasted form. It was a wonder Nika was still alive. Why hadn\u2019t the doctors done something before now? Why had they waited until it got this bad before treating her more drastically? Was her psychosis so much worse than her physical state that they hadn\u2019t even noticed?</p><p>She had no answers, but she sure as hell was going to find some.</p><p>They hurried out into the parking lot, and out of the corner of her eye, Andra saw movement. She held Nika tighter and sped her pace. The howl of those demons got louder as they neared, and she was sure she could practically hear the sound of their claws scraping across the pavement.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d said Logan from behind her.</p><p>\u201cGet in your truck and go,\u201d Paul ordered Andra.</p><p>She thought about telling him she wouldn\u2019t leave without him, but the truth was, she would do just about anything to get Nika out safely. He was a big boy, and she\u2019d seen firsthand that he was capable of taking care of himself. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill the fuckers,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>Paul\u2019s voice came from beside her, strong and steady. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>He pressed one finger against her bare arm for a moment and she felt a shock of energy jump into her, like static electricity, only it didn\u2019t hurt. Instead, an odd sense of peace flittered over her skin, making her feel safe and protected.</p> <p>She looked down and saw a bright bloodred mark on her skin where he\u2019d touched her. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloodmark. I\u2019ll be able to find you now, wherever you go,\u201d said Paul. Something about his tone, the way he spoke the words, told her that it was less a statement of fact than it was a promise. He would find her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d whimpered Nika.</p><p>Andra didn\u2019t stop to ask her if she was sure. The trembling in her body told Andra she was. How she knew it was true was another story\u2014one that they didn\u2019t have time for right now.</p><p>Paul took a fighting stance between her and the direction of the howls. He gave her one last look, then turned away.</p><p>Andra had to choke down the urge to go back and fight at his side. She belonged there. She knew it was true, though she had no idea how she knew. There seemed to be a lot of that going around tonight.</p><p>Andra slid Nika into her truck, jumped into the driver\u2019s seat, started the engine, and drove away. In her rearview mirror, she saw half a dozen of those furry things leap from the shadows and charge the men.</p><p>Paul\u2019s sword flashed under the lights of the parking lot as he slashed at one of the demons, his body strong and fluid as it moved across the pavement. She could watch him move like that for hours and still not be bored. He made fighting look so easy, so effortless. Almost beautiful.</p> <p>Andra hit the curb and pulled her attention back to her driving. She didn\u2019t look back again. Nika was safe. That had to be enough.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. She felt as if she were abandoning the only people on earth who had even the slightest prayer of saving her sister from her insanity. Not to mention leaving behind a man who made her body come alive every time he touched her. As selfish as it was for her to even put that in the equation, she did. She wanted more time with him to figure out what it was about him that called to her and made her heart pound.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to die,\u201d whispered Nika. \u201cThere are too many monsters. And more are coming.\u201d</p><p>Andra glanced sideways. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. They\u2019re coming, Andra. I feel them.\u201d Nika looked as lucid as she ever did, not that that was saying much. \u201cPlease, we have to go back.\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s hand clamped hard on the steering wheel so she wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid and turn around. \u201cI can\u2019t risk it. You\u2019re too weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Andra. Go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need them.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Maybe she was right.</p><p>Andra\u2019s knuckles were white and her body tightened in indecision. There was so much at stake here. Nika\u2019s life hung in the balance no matter what she did. If she went back, she might be ripped apart by monsters. If Andra didn\u2019t turn around and the men were slaughtered, then Nika might spend the rest of her life screaming in fear. At least until she starved to death.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Andra. I need him.\u201d</p><p>The pleading tone in her voice finally decided Andra. She hadn\u2019t been able to do much for her sister for eight years. In all that time, Nika had never asked for anything from Andra until now. This was something she could give her, and even if it was the wrong choice, it beat the hell out of starving to death. Didn\u2019t it? Heaven knew she didn\u2019t like the idea of leaving those men back there to die. Not to mention what would happen to the people in the hospital if the monsters managed to get in.</p><p>Where Nika\u2019s bloody gown was.</p><p>\u201cBuckle up and hold on,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>They were on a long road leading out to a major street. The only traffic out here was farmers and people headed to the hospital. Andra took a hard one-eighty and hit the gas. The truck spun around with a rocking jolt and headed back up the hill.</p><p>\u201cHand me my shotgun. Under the seat.\u201d</p><p>The parking lot was up ahead. The fight was still raging. It looked like Paul and Madoc had taken down three or four of those things. She wasn\u2019t sure what Logan was doing, but he was working hard at it\u2014standing totally still with his hand raised and some kind of light pouring out of it, splashing up against the nearest wall of the hospital. Freaky.</p><p>Andra took the offered shotgun and told Nika, \u201cGet down and stay there.\u201d</p><p>Nika did, but Andra heard her frightened chanting, \u201cThey\u2019re coming, they\u2019re coming, they\u2019re coming. . . .\u201d</p><p>Since she was out of hands to roll the window down, Andra used the butt of the weapon to break the glass out of the driver\u2019s-side window. She cleared enough of it out of the way to shove the barrel out.</p><p>Three of those roach things had shown up, and they were all in a nice, neat little clump.</p><p>Andra killed the lights on her truck and sped toward them. They didn\u2019t see her coming until it was too late. She floored it and slammed the front of her truck right into them. The things scattered like bowling pins. One of them went under her wheels and made the truck bounce with a sickening crunch as its exoskeleton collapsed under the wheel.</p><p>She executed another hard turn, nearly clipping a BMW in the parking lot, and went back for more, just in case they didn\u2019t stay down.</p><p>\u201cYou okay down there?\u201d she asked Nika.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, but she didn\u2019t sound okay. She sounded like she was wishing for an airsick bag.</p><p>\u201cJust hold on. We\u2019re almost done here.\u201d</p><p>From this angle, she had a great view of Paul and Madoc slicing away, their thick arms and muscular backs working almost in unison. That was a beautiful sight to behold. Pure female fantasy fuel.</p><p>She pulled her gaze away and focused on business. One of the things she\u2019d hit got back up. It was oozing green stuff from a crack in its chest, which worked for her. Andra aimed and fired at that crack, hoping her shot might be able to bust through. The thing exploded like a watermelon filled with dynamite. It flew into a bunch of bits, making her windshield wipers a necessity. Green, fleshy bits smeared over the glass, and her stomach gave a warning heave.</p><p>Andra swallowed to keep everything down. There wasn\u2019t time to be sick now, so her stomach would just have to wait.</p><p>She scanned the area, but she was running out of targets. The men had done their job and now stood near piles of fur leaking black blood.</p><p>Nika could not see that. She was way too fragile to face a sight straight out of her mind\u2019s own horror flick.</p><p>\u201cYou stay down, baby,\u201d she told Nika. \u201cWe\u2019ll be out of here in a sec.\u201d</p><p>She drove her truck to the men just as they were cleaning off their swords. Logan looked paler and thinner than he did before, but other than that, he seemed fine. Paul was breathing hard, but unhurt. Madoc, on the other hand, had taken a nasty gash across his thigh.</p><p>\u201cYou came back,\u201d said Paul. It sounded like an accusation, but one she was willing to let slide.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t let you have all the fun.\u201d</p><p>Madoc snarled at her, \u201cGet the fuck out of here. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d said Paul. \u201cHis blood will only draw more of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re close,\u201d whispered Nika from where she bent down.</p><p>This time, Andra believed her.</p><p>Madoc growled like some kind of wild animal, then said, \u201cYou two go with her. I\u2019ll draw them away.\u201d</p><p>Nika grabbed her head and started chanting, \u201cNo, no, no, no . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cScoot over and take care of her,\u201d offered Paul. \u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>Andra was glad to. She pulled Nika into her lap, making sure her eyes were covered and her IV stayed safely in place. Logan got in the passenger\u2019s side. He really didn\u2019t look well at all. In fact, he looked a lot like he had when Madoc had carried him into her apartment\u2014thin and pale and shaking.</p><p>Paul drove off, leaving Madoc behind.</p><p>\u201cIs he going to be okay?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cIf he gets mobile, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Something in his tone said it was wishful thinking. \u201cLogan, did anyone in the hospital see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d whispered Logan on a weary wisp of air. \u201cI shielded them.\u201d</p><p>So that was what he was doing out there. Holy freaking cow. This was getting weirder by the moment. It was one thing to know monsters were real\u2014she\u2019d gotten used to that notion years ago\u2014but magic? That was a little harder to swallow.</p><p>And made way too much sense, considering the things she\u2019d seen over the past decade. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her whole perception of the world shifted in that moment, and it was as if she were suddenly looking back-stage at all the mechanics happening behind the scenes. There was so much more going on than even she knew. She wasn\u2019t sure she really wanted to see any more. Her life was already complicated enough as it was.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go now?\u201d Andra asked.</p><p>Paul shot her a quick glance, then looked at Nika. Compassion wrinkled his brow, and he shook his head. \u201cIf you go home with us, we may be able to help her.\u201d</p><p>Nika was still chanting, \u201cNo, no, no . . .\u201d</p> <p>Andra couldn\u2019t stand to see her like this. If there were anything in her power she could do to help, she had to try. It didn\u2019t matter how much she didn\u2019t want to dig deeper into this new world of magic she\u2019d just discovered. She was Nika\u2019s big sister, and she\u2019d do whatever it took to make her well again.</p><p>Andra smoothed Nika\u2019s white hair back from her face, hoping to comfort her. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d</p><p>Madoc made sure he left a nice, easy-to-follow trail of blood as he walked out of sight of the mental hospital. None of those whack jobs inside needed to see the kind of beating he was about to lay out. Their minds would really be fucked-up then.</p><p>The hospital was nice and isolated, which meant there was plenty of farmland out here, all of it framed by thick growths of trees. He found a dark, secluded spot with plenty of room to fight before he stopped.</p><p>His body was humming with power. It pounded against his eyes and scratched at his veins trying to get out. Hell, he felt like he was going to be shaken apart by it if he didn\u2019t do something soon, and that little skirmish hadn\u2019t even been a challenge. Thank God the night was young. He had hours of darkness before all the Synestryn would retreat back into the holes where they lived and he wouldn\u2019t be able to find them and kill them any longer.</p> <p>Madoc ripped off his T-shirt and tied it around the wound in his thigh to slow the bleeding. He didn\u2019t want to pass out from blood loss while there was still fighting to be done. He needed every ounce of exertion he could get to stave off the fucking pain grinding at his bones. Not to mention that if he passed out, it would be the last thing he did. Literally.</p><p>Then again, maybe that wouldn\u2019t be so bad. There was no way death could hurt more than living. No fucking way.</p><p>A deep, growling rumble shook the ground. Demons were nearby. They\u2019d found his scent and would be here any minute.</p><p>Good. He could hardly wait.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Nika felt the monsters\u2019 hunger. Their excitement.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t want to go with them, but she had no choice. A sliver of her mind was inside them, dragging her along on their hunt.</p><p>She tried to think about something else\u2014to turn the channel in her head so that she was back in the truck with Andra, safe and sound in her sister\u2019s lap. She liked that part of herself. Even though there were strangers in the truck with her, and one of them wanted to drink her blood, it was better than the other places she existed right now.</p><p>So many places. So many monsters. She couldn\u2019t keep track. Her mind was torn into too many pieces and she no longer felt there was any of her real self left.</p><p>Nika saw through the eyes of a pack of sgath as they hunted. She felt damp grass under her paws and the warm night air ruffle her fur. Her claws dug deep into the earth with every powerful stride of her body. Prey was close. She could smell its blood, rich with power.</p><p>Her belly rumbled with hunger and her mouth watered, dripping glowing saliva onto the ground as she passed over it. She was close. She could hear her prey\u2019s slow, steady heartbeat.</p><p>Her pack broke through the trees and she saw then what she hunted. He had a sword and wore the luminescent collar that marked him as a Theronai\u2014a warrior who wanted to kill her and rid the earth of all of her kind.</p><p>The part of Nika that knew she was human cheered for the man\u2014the same man who had been near her hospital bed earlier. But the part of Nika that was beast hissed at him in hatred. She was going to sink her teeth into his flesh and gulp down his blood before it could soak into the earth and be wasted.</p><p>More pieces of her huddled inside three more of the sgath as they charged the man. She saw his attack from all angles at once and her human mind had to struggle to turn the images into something she could translate. It was too much input. Too much hatred and rage coming from all sides of her. She didn\u2019t want to see the man\u2019s death, but if she stayed among the sgath, she feared that was what would happen.</p> <p>The man looked into one pair of her eyes as she lunged for his throat. He didn\u2019t recognize her. He didn\u2019t know this wasn\u2019t what she wanted. She didn\u2019t want him to die.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even appear to move, but she felt the metal of his blade slide through her belly. She landed hard on the ground and her insides were oozing out of a neat opening. Her paws were clumsy and couldn\u2019t push all the organs back in. Her own blood smelled like food and she was so hungry. She knew it was futile and that she was dying, but couldn\u2019t stop herself from lapping it from the ground as she bled out.</p><p>Back inside of the real Nika, her stomach rebelled at the acid taste of the blood, the thick, rotting smell of it. She shoved out of the thing\u2019s mind, only to find herself trapped inside another. It was hiding from the man, waiting to strike as soon as he turned his back.</p><p>Only years of practice allowed her to pull back into her real body.</p><p>God, she was so weak. She could barely lift her head. \u201cHe\u2019s in trouble,\u201d she managed to get out.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cThe Theronai who was with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any Theronai, baby,\u201d said Andra in that patient, gentle voice she always used with her crazy sister.</p><p>Nika wanted to scream at her that she wasn\u2019t crazy\u2014her mind was just shattered into a thousand fragments that lived inside others\u2014but she knew from experience that it never worked. When she shouted, the orderlies came with needles and put her real mind to sleep so that she had no place to retreat to. No place to hide.</p><p>Dreaming was a horrible collage of blood and hunger and war, with her mind trapped inside so many monsters. But that wasn\u2019t the worst. She could hardly stand being with Tori anymore. The things they had done to her were hideous. Inhuman. She wasn\u2019t even really Tori anymore\u2014she was something dark and twisted the Synestryn intended to use as a weapon.</p><p>But Nika had promised Tori she wouldn\u2019t leave her, so she hadn\u2019t. Not once in all these long, painful years.</p><p>\u201cYou have to warn him,\u201d said Nika. \u201cThere\u2019s a sgath hiding nearby. Behind him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is she talking about?\u201d asked Paul. \u201cHow does she know about Theronai and sgath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d said Andra. \u201cBut what I do know is that she\u2019s been dead-on accurate all night. I suggest you listen to her.\u201d</p><p>The truck slowed and then stopped. Nika forced her eyes open, though the effort was nearly more than she could stand. She felt like a deflated balloon, empty and limp. Useless.</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking about, baby?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cThe man. With you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d</p><p>The name sounded right in her mind, like the wind roaring inside her had suddenly died down and she could hear herself think again. \u201cYes. Madoc. He\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know, child?\u201d asked a new voice. She turned her head toward him and saw a faint silvery light coming from within his eyes.</p><p>She knew that light. That hunger. Panic gave her strength and she scrambled away from the monster. \u201cHe wants my blood. Don\u2019t let him have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLiar, liar, liar.\u201d Oh, God, she was losing herself again, spreading back out into the night, back into the minds of the monsters who hunted and killed and shoved their sins into her soul each time they did.</p><p>She called out to Tori to help her, but there was no answer, and she couldn\u2019t find her baby sister\u2019s mind among all the rest. They pulled at her, stretching her into a thousand thin strands that she was sure would break. She couldn\u2019t take this anymore. She had to stop fighting. Give up. Let them have her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t care anymore. She\u2019d do anything to make it stop, even if she broke her promise to Tori.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she heard herself whisper. It was a good sound, her own real voice coming out of her own real mouth. She could take that sound with her and be at peace. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Nika went limp in Andra\u2019s arms. Her breathing was labored, and Andra could see the rapid beat of her heart in the veins along her temple.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dying,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>Outrage and denial rose up in Andra, consuming her. \u201cNo!\u201d she shouted. \u201cShe\u2019s not. She\u2019s going to be fine. Her IV bag is empty. That\u2019s all. We need to get her another.\u201d She prayed to God it was true. She couldn\u2019t lose Nika, too. If she did, she\u2019d have no one else. No family. No friends.</p><p>Paul\u2019s hand settled on her arm, and warmth and compassion fell like a blanket over her skin. She wanted to crawl into his lap and stay there, where she felt good. Protected. Where Nika would be safe.</p><p>But that was artificial. Whatever this thing between them was, it wasn\u2019t real. Just a bit of magic, probably designed to trick her. And even if it wasn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t do a damn thing for Nika.</p><p>Andra pulled her sister close and rocked her. She tried to think of a way to soothe her, but nothing came to her, not even the faint memory of a song they used to sing. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get her to a place she can rest, eat,\u201d said Logan. \u201cShe\u2019s too weak to travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Gerai house not far from here. We\u2019ll go there.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what a Gerai house was, but she trusted Paul to know what he was doing. \u201cWhat about Madoc?\u201d asked Andra. \u201cWe should at least let him know what she said.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s body shifted as he pulled out his cell phone and dialed. In the quiet of the truck\u2019s cab, she could hear the deep sound of Madoc\u2019s voice through the thin plastic. \u201cKinda busy,\u201d he panted.</p><p>\u201cNika said you\u2019re in danger.\u201d</p><p>There was a grunt and a monstrous howl of pain. \u201cNo shit. Tell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said there\u2019s a sgath there, hiding behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell would she\u2014Hold on.\u201d A series of vicious growls filled the line, then silence.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d said Paul. \u201cYou there?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cMadoc?\u201d He glanced over at Andra and shook his head.</p><p>A sharp yelp of pain filled the line. It sounded like someone had kicked a dog. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here. Found the fucker. Killed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re packing it in for the night. Can you catch up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get it stopped and come join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it would be nice to have another sword around to guard the women.\u201d</p><p>Andra almost said she could guard herself, but she held in the stupid, self-indulgent lie. The more swords they had between Nika and those things out there, the better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI kinda had plans,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>\u201cChange them, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. Whatever. I\u2019ll go clean off in the lake and meet up with you soon. Good enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks, man.\u201d</p> <p>Madoc didn\u2019t bother to reply. The guy was not exactly Mr. Friendly. Andra was glad he was on their side.</p><p>Paul got the women settled in one of the bedrooms of the Gerai house. Like so many other Gerai houses, this one was isolated, far away from prying neighbors. It was a three-bedroom ranch, stocked with food, clothes and supplies\u2014anything they might need to refuel and protect themselves and any humans who might be along for the ride. Because these places of refuge were kept up by the blooded humans known as Gerai, the term stuck.</p><p>Never before had Paul been so glad they had a safe place nearby. Nika didn\u2019t look good.</p><p>Andra slid Nika under the covers, then lay down beside her and held on tight. Nika looked so frail beside Andra, like a word spoken too harshly would shatter her thin bones.</p><p>Even if she was a Theronai like Andra, she could keep going for only so long. They needed to get some food into her, get that IV out of her arm without her bleeding everywhere. They really didn\u2019t need to draw more Synestryn.</p> <p>Andra stroked her sister\u2019s hair and whispered to her in a voice too low for Paul to hear. Whatever she said, her body was tight with tense desperation.</p><p>Andra must have known how bad Nika was, even if she didn\u2019t want to admit it. Her fear gave her away. He could see it in the way her fingers trembled as she ran them over Nika\u2019s head, the way her eyes darted frantically over her sister\u2019s thin form as if looking for a way to fix her.</p><p>Paul had to grit his teeth to hold himself back from Andra. He wanted to comfort her and pull her into his arms and shield her from all the bad stuff in life. Ironic. In his line of work, that was all he had to offer. Anything else was just a temporary illusion.</p><p>He made himself step out of the room and close the door. He needed Logan to look at Nika and see if there was anything to be done for her, no matter how small. Now that she was asleep, at least he wouldn\u2019t scare her.</p><p>Logan was out in the front yard of the small house, sniffing the air. Darkness seemed to close in around him, but it suited him well. He belonged out here in the middle of the night. All the Sanguinar seemed to be most at ease in the dark.</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t understand it, but he\u2019d come to accept it over the decades. He\u2019d much rather be lying on some sun-drenched beach, but that wasn\u2019t in the cards for him. He could no more work during the day than a rancher could do his job in the middle of Manhattan. It just wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p> <p>\u201cAre we clear?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. For now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go see what you can do for Nika while she\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t turn. He continued to stare out into the night. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do. She\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes slid shut in grief. Poor Andra. She loved her sister so much. He could see it in every move she made. Nika was her world, and she was going to lose her.</p><p>Whatever it took, he\u2019d help her through this. Be there for her. \u201cWhy is she dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell without taking her blood, and she\u2019s too weak for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do anything? Help her hold on for a while longer so she can get stronger?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should you care what happens to one single soul?\u201d asked Logan.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to remind him that Nika probably wasn\u2019t human. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Logan turned and stared at Paul with those icy eyes. \u201cNo. Why should I? She was raised as a human. They care nothing for my kind. They call us vampires. Have you seen the films they\u2019ve made about my people? The lies they tell their children about us, as if we were out to hunt their kind to extinction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your food. That would make anyone feel a little uneasy, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only take their blood. I would hope that fact would put them at ease if they stopped to think about it for a single moment. Why would I kill something I need to survive? It would be like a farmer cutting down his orchard to make it simpler to harvest this year\u2019s fruit.\u201d</p><p>A sudden realization came to Paul\u2014one he\u2019d never even considered. \u201cYou resent them. The humans. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do. You are pissed off because you need them. Or us. I have to admit, I\u2019d be a little pissed, too, if I had to depend on someone else so heavily.\u201d</p><p>Logan snorted. \u201cYou say that as if you don\u2019t need a woman to live.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Andra.</p><p>Paul stifled a thrill of excitement and chained his needs until they quieted. He was going to have to figure out what this thing between them was, but now wasn\u2019t the time. She had more important things to think about. \u201cI do need a woman, but I\u2019ve lived on my own for a long time. You never have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough of this.\u201d Logan shoved past him. \u201cI\u2019m going inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all makes a lot more sense now. You Sanguinar aren\u2019t all dark and brooding. You\u2019re pouting. You don\u2019t like the rules and you can\u2019t change them, so you\u2019re pouting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing of what it\u2019s like to be my kind. Stop pretending you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d</p><p>Before Paul saw it coming, Logan had grabbed him and shoved him up against the door. Logan was weak from exertion, but even weak, he was still strong enough to make Paul take notice.</p><p>He could feel the edges of the small window pressing into his back as well as the man\u2019s bony forearm cutting off his air. \u201cWe\u2019re not pouting. We\u2019re dying. Two more of my brothers died while you slept. They starved to death because there is no food for us, and yet your people look down on us like we are vultures, resenting us for the blood we must have to live.\u201d</p><p>Paul kept his hands off his sword with an effort of will. He wasn\u2019t about to cut down the only person around who might be able to save Nika. He decided to be a bigger man than that and held up his hands in surrender.</p><p>Logan let him go, but Paul was going to be wearing a bruise across his throat for days, he was sure. \u201cYou want more blood?\u201d croaked Paul. \u201cFine, take some of mine, but use it to save the girl.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s eyes flared and a predatory hunger dilated his pupils. \u201cGive me your arm.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Logan came into the bedroom without knocking, making Andra jump up from the bed. She tried to cover her startle, but the slight lift at the corner of his beautiful mouth told her he knew what she was doing. And found it amusing.</p><p>His color was better and he looked as if he\u2019d gained weight again. It had to be some kind of optical illusion, because no one\u2019s size changed that fast. It wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>Then again, she\u2019d seen a whole lot of impossible things in the past twenty-four hours.</p><p>\u201cLeave us,\u201d he ordered her, nodding to Nika.</p><p>\u201cLike hell I will. I\u2019m staying right here where I can keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do what? What do you think you could possibly do to stop me if you wanted to?\u201d</p><p>He had a point. She didn\u2019t even have her shotgun. Okay, time to make nice. \u201cI\u2019m worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith good reason. She\u2019s not likely to survive.\u201d</p><p>Andra locked her knees and her throat closed up for a moment as panic grabbed hold of her. A giant well of grief was building inside her, and the only thing keeping it from spilling over was hope\u2014the hope that he was wrong. That there was something someone could do with all the magic she\u2019d seen to put Nika back together. \u201cPlease,\u201d she begged, not even caring about her stupid pride. \u201cPlease do something to save her.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s jaw bunched and his eyes fell shut in defeat. He let out a heavy sigh. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll try, but there\u2019s little I can do without her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much, but more than she can give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have mine,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>Logan leaned toward her until his nose was almost touching her neck. She braced herself for his bite, but it never came. Instead, he breathed in deeply, as if smelling her skin.</p><p>He straightened and shook his head. \u201cNot today. I took too much from you before. But I will hold you to your offer and drink from you again once you are fully recovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine now. Nika is the important one here.\u201d</p><p>Logan pinned her with a bright stare. \u201cPaul would argue that point. Besides, he needs you. You should go to him.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to, but that was just more of the artificial hocus-pocus stuff. As long as it wasn\u2019t real, she could ignore it. \u201cI will once you try to help Nika.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long moment before giving her a single nod. \u201cGo fill the bathroom sink with water, wet a towel, and bring it to me.\u201d</p><p>Andra did as he asked. When she returned a few seconds later, Logan was sitting on Nika\u2019s bed with one hand on her forehead and the other between her flat breasts. His head was bowed as if in prayer, and she could almost feel a shimmering kind of heat coming off of him.</p><p>He lifted his head. His breathing was a little labored. \u201cCome hold the towel nearby.\u201d</p><p>Andra went to him and held it out. Drips of water slid down her hands and landed on the hardwood floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take the catheter out of her arm and put it in the towel. I want you to wrap it up as quickly as you can and shove it in the sink. Run water over it to drown the scent. We don\u2019t want the smell of her blood getting into the air and bringing the Synestryn down on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can really smell it that well?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look that made her feel like an idiot for not knowing the answer. \u201cDo you want to take the chance?\u201d</p><p>Andra shook her head.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Here we go.\u201d He took the tape from Nika\u2019s arm. Her thin, loose skin stretched too easily, making the job more difficult. He lifted her arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to lick the blood away and heal the wound with my mouth, so if you don\u2019t want to see that, don\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNika can\u2019t fight off an infection. Please tell me she\u2019s safe from the germs in your mouth. They\u2019re magic or something, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, and the beauty of it nearly made Andra drop the towel. She wondered how many women had fallen at his feet because of that smile alone. That was one serious natural weapon.</p><p>\u201cMagic germs. I like that,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s perfectly safe for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The plan went just as he\u2019d said. He pulled the IV out of her arm and plopped it down on the towel. Andra wrapped it up tight and raced it into the bathroom, where she ran water over the whole mess. She left the water running and went back to make sure Nika hadn\u2019t suffered any ill effects of being licked by a vampire.</p><p>Her arm was fine and her skin was whole, as if she\u2019d never had the IV. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool,\u201d she told him.</p><p>But Logan wasn\u2019t listening. He was staring at the wall with wide eyes that were darting back and forth as if he were in REM sleep. Every second or two, his body would jerk like he\u2019d been hit with a jolt of electricity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not good.</p><p>Andra waved her hand in front of his face. \u201cHey. You in there?\u201d</p><p>His mouth started to move, but no sound came out.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing. Andra put her hand on his shoulder and shook him. \u201cLogan! Snap out of it.\u201d</p><p>He did. Finally. His eyes blinked slowly and stopped their Ping-Pong routine. He sucked in a deep breath as if it were the first one he\u2019d had in a while.</p><p>\u201cLeave us. I need time to examine her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you I will not harm her. I also promise you that if you don\u2019t go drag Paul in from outside, the Synestryn will likely find him before sunrise.\u201d</p> <p>Drag Paul? \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed strength to attend your sister. Paul offered me his blood. Unfortunately, I needed quite a bit and he had already donated recently. He\u2019s outside. Recovering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you say something before?\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cI did. You chose to ignore me.\u201d</p><p>She had to go to Paul. She couldn\u2019t leave him lying out there in the dark with all the monsters roaming around. \u201cIf you so much as muss her hair, I\u2019m going to kill you. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Logan gave her a patronizing smile. \u201cGo to your Theronai. Nika is safe in my care.\u201d</p> <p>Andra believed him, which might have made her certifiable, but there it was. Paul needed her now, and without him, Andra wasn\u2019t sure she could keep Nika safe from the monsters. Besides, she owed him. He\u2019d given his blood to help Nika, and in her book, that made him a hero.</p><p>She had just turned to leave when he said, \u201cOh, by the way, that necklace he wears is yours if you choose to take it.\u201d</p><p>Andra stopped in her tracks. She\u2019d felt that, too, but brushed it aside as one more irrational feeling. \u201cPaul never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s protecting you.\u201d</p><p>Andra frowned. \u201cFrom what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the responsibility of the power you will wield if you choose to wear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a level stare. \u201cMore than you can imagine. Enough to keep your sister safe. Maybe enough to heal her as well.\u201d</p> <p>It took her a couple of seconds to process what he was saying. This whole thing was so far-out, she didn\u2019t know what to think at first, but one thing was clear. If Paul could help her save Nika, she was going to make him do so. \u201cIs that why I keep feeling weird when I touch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s nature\u2019s way of helping you find him. I suggest you don\u2019t wait too long to make up your mind about whether or not you\u2019re going to claim what\u2019s yours. Nika is nearly out of time. She\u2019ll be lucky to survive three days at this rate.\u201d</p><p>Three days. Andra\u2019s throat tightened as she fought back tears. \u201cI don\u2019t need any time. I know what to do.\u201d</p><p>First she was going to make sure Logan wasn\u2019t full of shit. Then she was going to do the only thing she could.</p><p>Save Nika.</p><p>Andra found Paul slumped on the porch. His big body was limp and unmoving. Panic skittered over her skin as she raced to him, looking for signs of life.</p><p>She pressed her fingers against his neck to feel for a pulse, and warmth spread up her arm. He pulled in a shuddering breath, and Andra\u2019s eyes closed in relief. His pulse was strong and he was breathing steadily.</p><p>Now all she had to do was get him inside, where there was at least a door between them and the monsters. She knew from experience that that wouldn\u2019t stop them for long, but at least it would slow them down. Out here in the open with darkness all around them, nothing would.</p><p>Andra gave his arm an experimental tug. Lord, he was heavy\u2014easily eighty pounds heavier than she was. She could do it, but one of them was going to get their shoulder dislocated in the process.</p><p>Maybe if she pushed him over the wooden planks, it would be easier. He might get splinters in his ass, but she\u2019d be glad to pull those out for him if they lived through it. She was pretty sure she\u2019d enjoy getting a nice long look at his muscular backside, anyway.</p><p>She moved him just enough that his head lolled to one side. The iridescent choker he wore caught and held light from the single bulb glowing above them.</p><p>That choker was hers. It always had been. She wanted to take it back.</p><p>All this magic hoo-ha left her stumbling in the dark, but she had some strong instincts about this thing, and she wasn\u2019t afraid to follow them, especially after Logan\u2019s coaching. If Nika didn\u2019t make it, she had nothing to lose, anyway.</p><p>Andra reached out and grazed it with the tip of her finger. A happy tingling sensation swept up her arm and settled deep in her chest, giving her confidence that this was the right thing to do. The colors inside the band swirled around that contact, as if it knew she was touching it. A plume of sapphire blue spread out from under her finger, expanding in concentric rings as it moved across the necklace.</p><p>The color was so pretty, so rich and deep, she wanted to have it for her own and see it grace her throat. Just as the thought entered her head, the band split open and fell from Paul\u2019s thick neck.</p><p>Andra retrieved the slippery length from the wooden planks and let it slide over her fingers, passing it from one hand to the other. It was still warm from Paul\u2019s body and heavier than she would have expected. It looked as though it were made out of some kind of plastic, but now that she held it and felt its weight, she knew that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><p>The ends were blunt, with no clasp, but she figured that the same magic that made it come off would fasten it again. She placed the band around her throat and the ends seemed to find each other as if they were drawn together like magnets.</p><p>As soon as she felt the muted click of the band connecting to itself, Paul\u2019s eyes opened. Gold chips shone bright within the deeper brown of his eyes, making them sparkle under the porch light. His gaze moved to her throat and his hand went to his own.</p><p>\u201cHow did you . . . ?\u201d His voice was a shocked whisper of sound, barely audible over the crickets chirping nearby.</p><p>He reached out and placed one blunt fingertip against the band and slid it over it, brushing her skin along the edge as he passed. His pupils dilated and his nostrils flared. He let out a deep, satisfied groan that made a shiver course up her spine. \u201cSo good,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t have done that, but it feels so good not to hurt anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou were unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfect now. Thanks to you.\u201d His finger moved from the choker up the side of her neck and down along her jaw. \u201cYou are one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re Theronai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re one of three races of guardians. Sentinels. We stand watch over the gate to another world, protecting it from Synestryn invasion. We also protect humans from falling victim to their evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you did with Sammy?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe were put here to protect others. It\u2019s in our blood\u2014in your blood. It\u2019s why you nearly kill yourself trying to find those lost children, why you never give up. You\u2019re like me. I had hoped you weren\u2019t human, but knowing it\u2019s true\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m human.\u201d Even as she said it, she questioned the truth of her words. She\u2019d always been different. So had her sisters. Andra had dismissed their weirdness as some kind of random genetic quirk, but now that Paul said the words, she realized she\u2019d been wrong. She was different from all the other humans because she wasn\u2019t human herself. It made too much sense not to be true, despite her desire to deny it.</p><p>Her mom had always been secretive about their father, evading questions, lying when she did give answers. Andra had always thought she was covering for some deadbeat, but maybe there was more to it than that.</p><p>If only Mom had lived so she could ask questions and find out the truth. Now all she had to go on was the word of a man she barely knew and her gut instincts\u2014instincts that told her she wasn\u2019t human. She was different. That was why she could find lost children.</p><p>Andra\u2019s world shifted. The colors that had painted her life\u2019s experiences changed from a distorted mass of mixed-up memories and unexplainable events to something clear and visible. That oddly shaped piece of the puzzle that had never quite fit suddenly fell into place. \u201cHow could I not have known?\u201d</p><p>Paul stroked her cheek, his eyes bright with compassion. \u201cYou were never told. But it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but my whole life has been a lie.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but feel betrayed by her mother. How many times had she asked Mom about their father? How many times had Mom looked her in the eye and lied?</p><p>\u201cThat lie protected you. It probably saved your life. And it gave me time to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t excuse what she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe there was no lie,\u201d said Paul. \u201cMaybe your mother didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew something. I can see it now, looking back. She lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know the truth now. You\u2019re a Theronai. You can accept that and move forward or wallow in the past. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to wallow. Logan had said Nika might not even live three days. \u201cNika needs me to move forward.\u201d</p><p>A satisfied gleam lit his eyes. \u201cThen we should finish this, you and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, staring at her mouth. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll show you the truth. And my power\u2014your power now. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201d</p><p>Andra stood and offered him her hand. He took it, but not because he was unsteady. His stance was solid and strong, just like the rest of him. \u201cYou seem to have recovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still a quart or two low, but I feel great.\u201d He slid his hand to the back of her neck and held her still. He was a few inches taller, and she found herself looking right at his mouth, wishing she had the guts to kiss him again. What she\u2019d had already wasn\u2019t nearly enough. Never would be.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he said, and it sounded like a promise. \u201cWhen it\u2019s safe. And we have plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s mind went foggy around the edges. Something was happening inside her\u2014some kind of warmth was swelling up, taking over. \u201cTime?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Paul nodded again. \u201cLots of time. I\u2019m looking forward to getting to know you. Learning what you like.\u201d</p><p>She liked him. Too much. So much it made her dizzy with the force of it and whatever was happening to her.</p><p>Andra swayed on her feet and grabbed hold of his arms to steady herself. His muscles were hard under her fingertips, sculpted so her hands fit just right against him.</p><p>\u201cYou and I, we can have forever if you want it.\u201d</p><p>Forever sounded pretty good right now, considering how she was feeling.</p><p>A sane part of herself said, \u201cBut I hardly know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll change soon enough. I\u2019m going to take you inside and we\u2019re going to finish what you\u2019ve started.\u201d</p><p>He scooped her up in his arms and she had the sensation of flying for a split second. A laugh bubbled out of her, and she sounded almost drunk to her own ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rested her heavy head on his shoulder and closed her eyes as that swelling warmth expanded inside her. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me?\u201d</p><p>He buried his nose in her hair and whispered low in her ear, \u201cShh. Just let go. You\u2019re mine now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Paul felt like a god. They weren\u2019t even completely united yet, and already she had changed his life. The pain was gone. Vanished. Strength surged through his body with every beat of his heart. Sure, he didn\u2019t have as much blood as he was supposed to, but it hardly mattered. Andra was in his arms, and he felt invincible, like he could beat down an entire nest of Synestryn single handedly and not break a sweat.</p> <p>Her body felt good against him and he didn\u2019t want to set her down. Not ever. He could feel the sleek firmness of muscles in her back and thighs, while the gentle swell of her breasts was so soft and yielding against his chest. Her short hair tickled his nose, baby fine and feather soft. And she smelled so good.</p><p>A man could lose himself in a woman like her and never feel deprived, never want for anything.</p><p>He had to stake his claim and make it final. A little twinge of guilt made him pause, but he brushed it away as inconsequential. She had no idea what she was getting into, but he couldn\u2019t let that stop him. Not anymore. She\u2019d taken his luceria of her own free will, and he wasn\u2019t going to let that miracle pass by. Not now, and probably not ever. He needed her too much. She had to stay with him. Be his. Belong to him and only him. He\u2019d make sure she\u2019d never regret it.</p><p>Something about that thought process was off, but he didn\u2019t care. It was time.</p><p>Paul laid her down on the couch, knelt beside her, and pulled his shirt off over his head.</p> <p>Andra smiled and leaned toward him, purring. She ran her hands over his shoulders and down across his lifemark. The branches swayed in reaction to her touch, and the single leaf he had left shivered. Her fingers were warm and curled against his flesh, kneading his muscles.</p><p>Paul\u2019s body responded predictably to a gorgeous woman\u2019s caress. His skin flushed hot and his dick hardened, making him wish he could lose the jeans, too. She was so pretty lying there, stroking him, staring at him as if he were the only man on the face of the planet. All he wanted to do was strip away her clothes and spread those long legs out so he could touch her, taste her, make her come just for him.</p><p>Oh, yeah. That was definitely a good plan.</p><p>But not until their ties were complete. Unbreakable. Not like what he\u2019d had with Kate. Once Andra was his, he\u2019d do all of that and more.</p><p>His sword was right at his side, ready and waiting as always. He gathered her hands and held them still so she wouldn\u2019t accidentally get cut as he drew the blade. \u201cMy life for yours,\u201d he told her as he sliced a thin cut over his heart, signifying his willingness to shed his blood for her. The promise filled him up, made him feel stronger, whole. He\u2019d do anything to protect her, and because she had taken his luceria, he would live long enough to fulfill that purpose.</p><p>He pressed his finger against the cut and smudged a bit of blood against the luceria. It shrank to fit close to her skin, the colors once again swirling frantically. Blue. There was more blue now than any other color.</p> <p>Disbelief rattled through him, freezing him in place and making him stare.</p><p>This was working. Andra really was his lady. Even seeing it, he still could hardly believe his good fortune. He reached out, intending to hug her to him in thanks, but the world dissolved, and she along with it.</p><p>His eyesight failed for a moment before returning again, but when it did, he was no longer in the Gerai house in Nebraska. He was in a small bedroom covered in rock-band posters and bits of girlish frill. A red feather boa hung over the dresser mirror, and a purple silk scarf had been tossed over the bedside lamp. A teenage girl was lying on her stomach, propped up on her elbows, reading a magazine on the bed. Her bare legs were waving in the air behind her; her toenails were painted bubblegum pink, her feet twitching in time to music pounding out of the radio.</p><p>The girl looked up from her magazine like she\u2019d heard a noise, and Paul could see now that it was a much younger version of Andra. She was maybe nineteen or twenty. She was thinner, less muscular, and so cute it made him grin.</p><p>This was a vision of her past\u2014something important the luceria had chosen to show him. Paul scoured the scene, soaking it in.</p><p>She was beautiful, but in a childish sort of way. He preferred the way she looked now\u2014confident and womanly and ready for whatever he had to give. Still, he would have given nearly anything to have known her then, when he would still have had time to be patient with her and ease her into his world carefully. Slowly.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t possible now. He needed her too much to slow down. The only thing he could do now was learn what he could about her to help make her transition as easy as possible.</p><p>A crash of breaking glass filled the air. A high-pitched scream followed, and then ended abruptly, as if cut off. Andra jumped from her bed and raced out of the room. Paul followed, unseen. Three steps down the hall, she came to a dead stop in front of a doorway. The door was open. Fresh blood coated the bright white paint and dripped off the bottom of the door, soaking into the carpet. She took a tentative step forward, and her bare foot sank into the wet carpet. Blood oozed between her toes.</p> <p>She jerked her foot back and looked like she might throw up.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh, God.\u201d Her hand reached out toward something on the floor just as another scream sounded from a room at the end of the hall.</p><p>Andra turned and rushed toward the scream.</p><p>Paul passed by the bloody door and saw the remains of Andra\u2019s mother lying on the floor inside the bedroom. The Synestryn had left her head and taken the rest. The woman\u2019s lifeless eyes stared up at him, her mouth frozen open in a silent scream. A heavy trail of blood marked where they\u2019d dragged her body out the window. From the guttural sounds coming from the darkness outside, Paul was certain they were still out there, feeding on her corpse.</p><p>That had been Andra\u2019s mother. Probably the most important person in her life. And now she was dead.</p><p>Andra opened the door at the end of the short hall. Another window had been broken here, too. Only this time, the sgath\u2019s work was not yet done. One of them crawled through the opening, its eyes glowing bright green. Its black forked tongue flicked out ahead of it, and it let out a feral hiss.</p><p>Andra stood frozen in fear. He could see the fine trembling of her thin body, hear her breathing too fast and hard.</p><p>\u201cMom! Andra! Help!\u201d shouted a child inside the room. \u201cTori, get back!\u201d</p><p>The sgath lunged forward and grabbed a small girl around the waist. She couldn\u2019t have been more than eight. She had the same dark hair and blue eyes that Andra did, only her hair curled in a wild mop. Her girly pink nightgown bunched up over the thing\u2019s furry arm as she struggled to get free.</p><p>Another girl, maybe twelve or thirteen years old, grabbed the sgath\u2019s paw in an effort to free her younger sister. The sgath twisted around oddly and raked its back claws across her thigh. She yelped and let go, falling back against the wall.</p><p>It was Nika. Paul was sure of it, only her hair was still dark and she was also years younger.</p><p>Nika pushed herself to her feet and looked at her wound in horror, then up again at her sister. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take Tori away.\u201d</p><p>Paul wasn\u2019t sure how Nika knew that, but she seemed to be sure. He had no idea what the sgath\u2019s plans for the child were, but it was clear it had some other purpose for her than food.</p><p>The smell of Nika\u2019s blood was in the air now. Another sgath crawled in through the broken window.</p><p>Andra snapped out of her shock and looked around frantically for a weapon. She grabbed a lamp off the nearest nightstand. With an enraged bellow, she hurled it across the room and hit the sgath holding Tori.</p><p>Of course, the lamp did nothing to the sgath. It broke against the thing\u2019s head and fell into a useless pile of pieces.</p><p>Blood pooled at Nika\u2019s feet, dripping heavily from her wound. Already, the poison from the sgath\u2019s claws was racing through her system, making her face flush with fever. Paul had no idea how she had survived that wound\u2014sgath poison was usually fatal if not treated immediately\u2014but he\u2019d seen her future and knew that she had somehow pulled through.</p><p>The monster holding Tori turned to leave, and Andra jumped onto its back.</p><p>Paul screamed at her to stay away. It wasn\u2019t safe. He reached for his sword, only to find he had none. Had no body here. His voice made no sound, either\u2014he was only an observer and could do nothing to help. Everything that was going to happen already had, and he could change nothing.</p><p>Andra clung to the sgath\u2019s back with her legs and dug her fingers into its eyes. It howled in pain and flung its head wildly to toss her off its back.</p><p>Andra held tight, clawing and digging. The sgath reared up and slammed her into a wall. Her head hit hard. Drywall crushed under the impact, and Andra let out a hoarse grunt of pain. Her grip loosened and the sgath moved away, letting her body slide to the floor in a limp heap.</p><p>Paul yelled at her to get up, but no sound came out of his mouth.</p><p>On the other side of the room, a sgath crouched at Nika\u2019s feet. She was shaking, but unable to move. The sgath\u2019s tongue flicked out, lapping up the blood as it seeped from her thigh. Her eyes were heavy-lidded and glassy, but her lips were moving and she stared at Tori, completely ignoring the sgath who fed from her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you,\u201d she whispered to her sister, over and over. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>Tori was screaming and fighting, but her small body was no match for the sgath. It carried her out the window and off into the night. The last thing Paul saw of her was her little arm reaching out toward her sisters for help.</p><p>Andra pushed herself to her feet. She could barely stand. Her body wobbled as she picked up a wooden desk chair and crossed to Nika. The sgath was too busy eating to notice her approach. She slammed the chair over the thing\u2019s head.</p><p>It yelped and turned around to attack.</p><p>An armed man rushed into the room. He could have been a plainclothes police officer, or maybe just a neighbor with a gun. Whoever he was, he saw the thing and opened fire. A few bullets later, the sgath decided to leave, leaped out the window, and raced away.</p><p>Andra collapsed to her knees at the window. \u201cTori!\u201d she shouted. \u201cTori!\u201d Her scream turned into a sob and Paul could hear her heart breaking.</p><p>There was an odd blur of movement around Nika, but Paul didn\u2019t care about that. The need to bear witness to Andra\u2019s pain was too strong. She\u2019d lost her family that night. Her mother and sister had died, and Nika had gone insane from the poison or trauma. No wonder Andra was so protective toward Nika. She was the only family Andra had left alive.</p><p>Paul mourned for her and wished again that he had found her earlier. In time to save her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you keep Nika safe,\u201d said Paul. This time he heard his words and knew he\u2019d returned back to the present. \u201cYou won\u2019t ever be alone.\u201d</p><p>But Andra didn\u2019t seem to hear him. She was lost inside her own vision\u2014whatever the luceria had chosen for her to see.</p><p>Energy pulsed around Andra, vibrating the air. She could feel the power flowing through the necklace, but could not yet touch it. Something was missing, but she had no idea what. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That power that had been hovering there, waiting for her, erupted in a tidal wave of electricity. Her hair stood up on end and her skin heated as bright sparks arced over her limbs. Her eyes grew hot and she felt like she might explode.</p><p>Andra shut her eyes tight against the pressure, and her vision filled with scenes from Paul\u2019s life. She saw him as a boy learning to use a sword, his limbs awkward as he became accustomed to their ever-growing length. She saw him as a teenager going toe-to-toe with half a dozen demons. She saw him as a younger man standing over the graves of his mother and sister.</p><p>She heard him vow that day to do whatever it took to rid the world of the Synestryn. He\u2019d give up his freedom, his power, his life\u2014anything\u2014to protect those whom the Synestryn hunted.</p><p>Then she saw a woman. Kate. She was standing on a lush hilltop, her long blond hair and billowing skirt flowing out behind her on the wind. Her deep green eyes matched the color of the surrounding forest, and when Paul approached her, she felt his resignation. His acceptance. He\u2019d loved her, but Kate loved another. He\u2019d tried to force her to stay with him, and she\u2019d rejected him.</p> <p>\u201cI will never be yours,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Andra watched as she took his luceria off and placed it back around his neck. Paul fell to his knees and clutched his bare chest as she watched, her face calm and impassive. Leaves fell from the branches of his tattoo until the limbs were nearly bare, and he was sweating and writhing on the ground in pain.</p><p>Kate saw his suffering, too, but after watching for a long moment, she turned her back on him and walked away. Toward another man.</p><p>Hours later, two young men found him lying on the ground. They carried his lanky body back to a village and laid him on the dirt floor inside a rough cottage. A beautiful woman in a gray gown knelt beside him. She placed her hands on his chest and bowed her head as if in prayer.</p><p>Slowly, small buds began to form on the limbs of his tree tattoo.</p> <p>The woman slumped over him and a craggy-faced man caught her up in his arms before she could fall.</p><p>The teenaged Paul opened his eyes and saw what the woman had done. Andra didn\u2019t know the language they spoke, but she understood the words all the same.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t finished growing yet, Theronai,\u201d said the woman in a weak voice. \u201cIt saved your life. That and the fact that you weren\u2019t with her for long. Fortunately, you\u2019ll recover this time.\u201d</p><p>The older man shot him a warning look. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time. I won\u2019t allow Gilda to do this for you again. It costs her too much. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sire.\u201d</p><p>The older man looked to one of the boys who\u2019d brought Paul there. \u201cFind Kate. Bring her here to answer for her actions.\u201d</p> <p>The boy bowed and fled from the cottage.</p><p>\u201cGo now, Paul, and make sure you\u2019re worth the trouble you\u2019ve caused this day.\u201d</p><p>Paul pushed himself to his feet and made his way unsteadily out the door. Andra could feel his anger and embarrassment as if they were her own. She could also feel his determination to do good and make this older man proud.</p><p>Years rushed by in Andra\u2019s head. She saw tiny glimpses of his life. His struggles to live up to his expectations. His battles. He\u2019d fought and killed thousands of monsters, saved hundreds of lives, and had surely been worth whatever trouble he\u2019d caused.</p><p>Why, then, didn\u2019t he feel he\u2019d done enough?</p><p>When she came back to reality, she asked, \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou as a boy. What Kate did to you. I don\u2019t understand what happened, but it nearly killed you, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>He looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s in the past. What matters is what we do now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan said that you might be able to make me strong enough to help Nika.\u201d</p><p>Golden shards of hope lit up within his eyes. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we must complete our union.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we do that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He leaned toward her, staring at her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve given you my promise to hold your life sacred above my own, and now, to seal us together, you must give me a promise in return.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of promise?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cPromise to stay with me,\u201d Paul told her. It was an open-ended vow, and one that would tie her to him for life. Part of him knew tricking her was wrong, but the rest of him didn\u2019t give a shit. He wanted to keep her. Forever. He didn\u2019t want to give her the chance to walk away like Kate had. He never wanted to go back to that life of torment again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay with you. Nika needs me.\u201d</p><p>Her rejection flooded him with anger and resentment. He wanted to roar at her that he needed her, too, but he held his tongue. Now was not the time to lose his head. He had to be careful here. Cautious. He\u2019d been hasty when he\u2019d bonded with Kate, and he wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake twice. He was older now. A grown man with three more centuries of maturity to keep him steady.</p><p>Three more centuries of pain screaming at him to make it work this time.</p><p>Paul took her hand in his and made his tone patient and understanding. \u201cI would never stand in the way of you caring for your sister. I already told you I\u2019d help you keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him as if trying to figure something out. \u201cBut this is a real promise, right? I can feel it.\u201d She pressed her hand to her chest. \u201cWhatever I promise will happen, whether or not I still want to uphold my end later.\u201d</p><p>So, she did know the stakes. He tried to convince himself that was for the best, but failed. He needed her to free him. To save him.</p><p>\u201cThen promise me whatever you can. Give me as much as you can and I will be content.\u201d Somehow.</p><p>She nodded slowly and spoke her vow with careful wording. \u201cOkay. As long as it doesn\u2019t get in the way of Nika\u2019s safety, I promise to stay with you for three days.\u201d</p><p>Three days. A mere blink of time to a man like him who\u2019d lived for centuries. Even Kate had stayed with him longer.</p><p>Paul\u2019s grand visions of a pain-free future at Andra\u2019s side crumbled to dust. There would be no forever for them, only a few brief days. He wanted to scream at her that it wasn\u2019t enough, that she had to take it back and give him more, but it was too late. The bond was made, the deal done, and Paul could already feel that promise becoming a part of him, albeit a small part.</p><p>Resentment rose up in his throat, leaving a bitter taste behind. He\u2019d spent his entire life fighting and suffering through pain and loneliness so that he could keep humans safe from the Synestryn. He\u2019d never once shirked his duties or tried to avoid the more dangerous missions so someone else would have to take his place. He\u2019d nearly died from injury or poison more times than he could count, but every time, he went back to the front lines as soon as he was able, because they needed him. And now, to survive, he needed a partner\u2014the only thing he\u2019d ever wanted for himself. He\u2019d finally found another woman who could save his life so he could keep fighting. He was willing to give her everything he had, including his life, and all she could offer him in return was three days.</p><p>How could she do this to him? How could she betray him so cruelly without even giving him a chance to prove to her how much he had to offer?</p><p>How could she be like Kate?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry,\u201d she told him, frowning at him in confusion. \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d</p><p>Paul stilled his rioting thoughts. She could probably already feel his emotions leaking through the connection of the luceria\u2014his ring and her necklace. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I was just hoping for more time. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes as if she knew he wasn\u2019t telling her the whole truth. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand, but then how could she? She wasn\u2019t part of his world. She didn\u2019t know what her vow meant or how it affected his life. \u201cIt will be fine,\u201d he reassured her. At least it was longer than he probably would have lived without her. He should have been happy about that. But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens then? At the end of our time?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cThe luceria falls off and you are free.\u201d And I go back to dying in pain.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>He chose to misunderstand her question. He didn\u2019t want her knowing of his weakness\u2014her power over him, and the guilt it would cause her if she knew the truth. She deserved better than that. \u201cThat\u2019s all you were willing to give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what happens if I decide to stick with you longer than that?\u201d</p><p>Paul had been so outraged he hadn\u2019t stopped to consider it. Hope rose up in him once again. He didn\u2019t have to die. She could still save him. All he had to do was make her love him before their time was up. Then she\u2019d promise to stay with him forever.</p><p>He could do it. He had the ability, now that he was connected to Andra. He could use the luceria to invade her mind and whisper to her soul that he was the only man for her. He could convince her that she was lost without him, and that they\u2019d been made to love each other. It would work.</p><p>He lifted her chin and looked into her eyes. Maybe he should start now, while she still knew nothing of what he could do. He\u2019d saved her life\u2014Nika\u2019s, too. She trusted him more now, which was going to make it easier for him to slip inside her natural defenses. To slip inside her. Make her body need him as much as her mind did. Then she\u2019d have no choice but to stay with him.</p><p>That part of his plan was going to be easy. She already wanted him. All he had to do now was show her how good it could be between them.</p><p>Paul flooded their new link with his desire for her. He hadn\u2019t stopped wanting her since he\u2019d met her, and it was easy to let that feeling roam free and take over. Let her feel what he did\u2014that prowling need to touch her. Taste her. Get her naked and wet beneath him, where he could have his fill.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut for a moment, and she groaned. Then she looked at his mouth and her tongue peeked out to wet her lips. Oh, yeah, she was definitely feeling him now.</p><p>There was nothing Paul could have done to prevent himself from kissing her, so he just gave in. He settled his mouth onto hers, fitting them together as if they\u2019d been made for this sole purpose. She let out a little gasp of surprise, then melted into his kiss. Her mouth was warm, soft, and pliant, and the tip of her tongue reached out to caress his lower lip.</p><p>Paul\u2019s hands pulled her upright, clenching against her back. He held her in place while he enjoyed her mouth, stroking and tasting and teasing her until she returned each thrust of his tongue with one of her own.</p><p>Somewhere in his mind warning bells were going off, but he ignored them. Andra was in his arms, willing and eager, and nothing else mattered.</p><p>Her hands slid up over his bare shoulders and it was all he could do to keep from growling with pleasure. The spark he\u2019d felt when he touched her before had magnified until it was a blazing, glorious fire in his gut. Her lightest touch ignited him, making him wish he could will away their clothes and sink into her supple body. She\u2019d love it. He\u2019d make sure she did. He\u2019d kiss every smooth expanse of her skin, explore every tempting dip and curve with his tongue. He\u2019d strip away any reservation she had with tender caresses of his hands and mouth. He\u2019d spread her out and worship her body with his until there was no room left for anything between them but slippery passion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she\u2019d be his. Totally. Completely. No turning back.</p><p>She was already close, hovering on the edge of giving him everything he wanted. It wouldn\u2019t have taken much to push her over. Her mind was open, receptive, and weak right now. It would take just a small brush of power over her thoughts and she would be on her way to total devotion.</p><p>His slave.</p><p>That thought stopped him cold. He didn\u2019t want that for her. That was how the Synestryn worked. They forced their human servants\u2014the Dorjan\u2014to love them, worship them.</p> <p>Paul pushed himself away from her, both her mind and body, before he did something irrevocable. Unforgivable.</p><p>Andra tried to pull him back against her, but she was weak and was no match for his will, even as threadbare as it was right now.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d she asked in a voice rich with arousal.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d he told her in a strained whisper. \u201cI want to, but . . . this is just wrong. It\u2019s not real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t real?\u201d she asked. Her voice shook. \u201cIt sure felt real to me.\u201d</p> <p>Paul scooted a couple feet away, leaving Andra lying there, all sprawled out and breathless. He had to look away and focus on the empty fireplace in order to regain his self-control.</p><p>\u201cYes. It did.\u201d Because he was such a fucking bastard. He was making it feel real for her.</p><p>Paul\u2019s stomach clenched and he had to adjust his jeans in order to pull in a breath without emasculating himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d she asked in a husky voice. \u201cI was right there with you, ready, willing, and eager.\u201d</p><p>The lingering effects of their kisses were still visible. Her skin had heated, and a pretty pink blush had spread up over her cheeks. Her lips were swollen and parted in invitation, and the languid sprawl of her long legs made Paul\u2019s fists tighten painfully in order to keep himself from reaching for her.</p><p>\u201cI know. Neither one of us was thinking straight. Logan and Nika are only a doorway away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNika,\u201d she breathed as if she\u2019d forgotten she even had a sister. \u201cWhat the hell was I thinking?\u201d She covered her face with her hands and let out a frustrated growl.</p><p>The urge to comfort her tugged at him, but he managed to keep his distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go clean up this blood before it is a problem.\u201d He stood, or rather, had intended to. Instead, he kind of lurched upward, winced as his erection was pinched painfully against his fly, and limped toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cLogan treated Nika\u2019s blood like it was some kind of toxic waste. He had me wrap up the IV in a wet towel so the monsters couldn\u2019t smell it, and leave everything under running water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably should have been more careful with mine, but I wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d followed him into the kitchen, but kept a safe distance. A smudge of blood was on her shirt as well. He nodded toward it. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need to change. I\u2019ll have to burn that shirt, along with anything Nika bled on.\u201d</p><p>Andra saw the blood, looked at it in horror, and stripped the shirt off, leaving only her sports bra behind. It was modest enough, but not nearly as modest as it would have needed to be to keep Paul from wanting to charge her.</p><p>\u201cIs there a clean one around here?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cAt least one of the bedroom closets will be full of clothes. Take whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>She turned to do just that when a scream ripped through the little house. Nika\u2019s scream.</p><p>Andra slammed the bedroom door open, unable to contain her fear for her sister. It was only twenty steps to the bedroom, but in that time, Andra\u2019s mind went through all the horrible things Logan could have done to her. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t Logan at all. Maybe the monsters had found them because of the blood.</p><p>When she got into the room, Nika was out of bed kicking and hitting Logan. He was standing in front of the open window, blocking the exit with his body. \u201cShe needs me!\u201d screamed Nika. \u201cI have to go find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d said Andra, rushing forward. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Nika\u2019s eyes met Andra\u2019s, but there was little of the sister Andra remembered left inside her right now. All that was left was the panicked desperation of fear. Andra had seen it enough times before to wish they had some kind of tranquilizer with them. That was the only thing that had ever worked at the hospital to calm her down so she wouldn\u2019t hurt herself.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d screamed Nika as if in pain. \u201cTori. They\u2019re hurting her.\u201d Nika clawed at Logan\u2019s body, but he did not move or even try to stop her from assaulting him.</p><p>Logan grimaced and looked at Andra. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt her, and if I try to restrain her, I will. You need to calm her down.\u201d</p><p>Nika screamed in outrage and pulled a framed picture from the wall. She slammed it into Logan\u2019s face. He ducked aside, but not enough. The frame splintered, the glass shattered, and some of it hit him, opening a gash along his temple.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d said Paul from behind her, and rushed into the bathroom.</p><p>Nika pulled a jagged shard of glass from the broken frame. It was about ten inches long and she held it like a weapon she was aching to use. Her arms were shaking with the effort of holding it up, and she swayed as if she were about to fall over.</p><p>Andra stepped forward slowly. \u201cNika, please put the glass down. You\u2019re going to hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>Nika\u2019s eyes were wild, but they pleaded with Andra to understand. \u201cI have to go. Tori needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTori is gone, baby. No one is going to ever hurt her again.\u201d Saying the words made Andra\u2019s throat tighten against the need to scream and lash out the way Nika was. Part of her envied Nika\u2019s ability to let go and rail at the world. But Andra had to be strong. Stay in control. She was the only one left to take care of Nika.</p><p>A fat tear slid down Nika\u2019s sunken cheek, breaking Andra\u2019s heart. \u201cThey\u2019re hurting her now. I can see it. Feel it. Please help her. Save her.\u201d Nika stared out into the night. \u201cShe\u2019s calling your name. Can\u2019t you hear it?\u201d</p><p>Andra closed her eyes against the image of her baby sister\u2019s cries for help. She\u2019d been eight, wearing a pink nightgown, clawing at the arm of the monster that held her. That had really happened, and even though it was years ago, it was still as horrible and devastating now as it had been then. Andra had failed her baby sister and let the monsters take her.</p><p>And now they were killing Nika, too. Slowly. Horribly.</p><p>Andra swallowed her pain, ground her teeth to fight back the tears, and stepped toward Nika. \u201cYou have to let her go. I know it\u2019s hard to accept. It took me years to do so myself, but she\u2019s gone, baby. I searched for her a long time\u2014for years\u2014and never found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her. It\u2019s the monsters lying to you, tricking your mind. Tori wouldn\u2019t want you to suffer like this.\u201d</p><p>Paul came out of the bathroom with a wet towel. Logan replaced the shirt he\u2019d wadded up against the wound with the towel. \u201cI have to leave before I draw them here,\u201d he told Paul.</p><p>Paul nodded, but kept his eyes on Nika and that make-shift weapon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feed so I can heal, and be back as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not back by daybreak, I\u2019m taking them to Dabyr.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded and left.</p><p>\u201cLet me have the glass,\u201d coaxed Andra.</p><p>Nika gripped the shard tighter, her paper-thin skin only a fraction of an inch from the broken edge. She couldn\u2019t stand any more physical damage. She was too weak.</p><p>\u201cJust what the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d barked Madoc from the doorway. \u201cLogan dashed out of here like his ass was on fire. What did you do to him? And why the hell didn\u2019t you let me watch?\u201d</p><p>Andra turned around to tell him she was trying to help her sister, but he wasn\u2019t talking to her. He was talking to Nika.</p><p>He strode forward, pushed Andra out of the way, and said, \u201cGive me that fucking glass and get your ass back in bed before you fall down.\u201d</p><p>Nika craned her neck to look up at him and blinked a few times. Then, amazingly, she offered Madoc the broken glass.</p><p>He took it and tossed it onto the dresser without looking where it landed, shattering. He was too busy glowering at Nika as she moved slowly toward the bed. She crawled back onto the mattress.</p><p>Madoc yanked the blanket up until it covered her to her neck, then nodded once as if satisfied.</p><p>He turned to Paul. \u201cYou can\u2019t even keep one scrawny woman in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Paul\u2019s fault,\u201d said Andra. \u201cLogan was watching her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking leech,\u201d growled Madoc under his breath.</p><p>Andra sat on the bed and checked Nika\u2019s hands for cuts. She was paler than normal and sweating, but appeared to be unhurt. In fact, she seemed to be calm again and more herself. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>Nika nodded. Her eyes were red from crying, but at least the tears had stopped falling.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not okay,\u201d spat Madoc. \u201cShe\u2019s too damn skinny. Girl needs a cheeseburger.\u201d</p><p>Andra glared up at him. She didn\u2019t care how big he was; he wasn\u2019t going to talk about Nika as though he knew her. \u201cShe has trouble eating. Back the hell off.\u201d</p><p>Madoc rolled his eyes and folded his body into a chair near the window. \u201cFeel better? I\u2019m all the way across the room now.\u201d</p><p>Nika grabbed the strap of Andra\u2019s bra, reminding her she still hadn\u2019t put a shirt on. \u201cYou have to find her. Promise me you\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>Andra gathered what was left of her patience. \u201cI can\u2019t, baby. Tori\u2019s dead. When you feel better, I\u2019ll take you to see her grave so you\u2019ll know it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmpty hole, empty hole, empty hole.\u201d That vacant look was back, and Andra wanted to scream in frustration and anger.</p><p>Instead, she smoothed Nika\u2019s white hair away from her face and forced her voice to come out even and calm. \u201cTry to get some sleep. We have to leave soon, and I want you to try to eat something before we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo blood. I won\u2019t drink it. You can\u2019t make me.\u201d Nika was gone now\u2014only an empty shell of insane terror remained. Andra had seen the look enough times to know it was useless to try to reason with her. Without the drugs the hospital gave her, she probably wouldn\u2019t even be able to sleep, either.</p><p>Nika was wasting away in front of Andra\u2019s eyes and there wasn\u2019t a thing she could do to stop it.</p><p>Paul\u2019s strong hand cradled her shoulder, and the touch of his bare skin on hers helped soothe her. Gave her the strength not to lose hope. \u201cNo blood. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChick thinks you\u2019re feeding her blood?\u201d asked Madoc.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d warned Paul. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any idea of what\u2019s going on here.\u201d</p><p>Madoc snorted. \u201cI know she\u2019ll die if you don\u2019t feed her.\u201d</p><p>Anger swelled up inside Andra until she had no choice but to let it out. She moved from the bed and stomped over to where Madoc sat. \u201cYou think you know what\u2019s best for Nika when not even her sister or a team of doctors can help her? Fine. You take care of her, then. Apparently, you\u2019re some kind of expert.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou coddle her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sick.

Not coddled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am protecting her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot from herself.\u201d</p><p>Andra couldn\u2019t take any more of his arrogance. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool if you think you know what\u2019s right for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You take care of her tonight, but I swear to God, if you hurt her, I\u2019ll kill you as slow as a man can die.\u201d It was a promise, and she felt the angry heaviness of it bear down on her. She stumbled and Paul caught her, holding her up.</p><p>Madoc gave her a cold, empty smile. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep. Didn\u2019t Paul tell you that when he collared you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know the ways of our world yet,\u201d said Paul. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to matter, because you\u2019re not going to hurt Nika, right?\u201d</p><p>Madoc shrugged. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving him alone with her,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cSure you are. We have a deal. And while we\u2019re all here making promises . . .\u201d Madoc knelt down in front of Andra. He drew his sword and cut open his chest, right through his shirt. \u201cMy life for yours.\u201d</p><p>Thank God Paul still had a hold on her arm or she would have fallen on her ass just then. Madoc\u2019s vow felt like a lead blanket covering her. Trapping her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she managed to croak.</p> <p>Madoc gave her another empty smile. \u201cYou\u2019d better get used to it. You\u2019ve got a shitload more of that headed your way once we get home.\u201d</p><p>Paul ran a reassuring hand over her bare back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Everything is going to be fine.\u201d He shot Madoc\u2019s chest a meaningful glance. \u201cClean yourself up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure will. Then the two of you can get the hell out. The crazy girl and I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in any shape to work,\u201d she told Madoc as he went to the adjoining bathroom.</p><p>Andra moved to follow him, ready to pound on him until he stopped being an ass. Paul stepped in front of her and she ran into his hard body.</p><p>\u201cLeave it alone, Andra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. She\u2019s my sister. She\u2019s weak and she can\u2019t look out for herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc won\u2019t hurt her. And someone needs to be with her so she won\u2019t try to escape through the window again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt should be me,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cYou told him he could stay. Now you\u2019ve got to live with it. Trying to stop him is only going to hurt you, and I can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>Nika had quieted, but she was still staring at the ceiling, her lips moving over and over in a silent chant. Andra hadn\u2019t been able to do anything for her, but Madoc seemed to at least be able to get her to listen. Maybe it was best if she let him try things his way. Nothing else was working.</p><p>Except that thing Paul had helped her do earlier to get her to eat. Maybe if she could convince him to show her how to do that, she could learn to help Nika on her own. He said she had power now, and she knew exactly how she wanted to use it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d said Andra, feeling a glimmer of hope.</p><p>\u201cYou know what she likes to eat,\u201d said Madoc as he came out of the bathroom. \u201cMake her something and leave it outside the door. I\u2019ll get her to eat.\u201d</p><p>Andra prayed his confidence wasn\u2019t hollow. \u201cJust be careful with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. She\u2019s fragile and all that shit. I got it already. Now get the fuck out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Paul took care of burning the clothes he and Madoc had bled on during their oaths to Andra. While the cloth burned, he found her a clean shirt to cover the tempting swell of her breasts.</p><p>When he came back into the kitchen, Andra had made a mountain of food for Nika. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she\u2019ll be able to eat all of this,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI know, but she freaks out over certain textures and colors. This way she\u2019ll have some things to choose from. Besides, I could use a meal, and I figured you all could, too.\u201d</p><p>Her movements were jerky and awkward, and he could see an angry red patch of skin where she\u2019d burned her hand on something. Through the luceria, he felt her frustration. Her fear for Nika\u2019s life. Her determination not to fail her sister.</p><p>He didn\u2019t dare tell her it would be okay. Life had taught him that it often wasn\u2019t. People died every day. Eventually, Nika would, too.</p><p>\u201cI want to try to reach her,\u201d said Andra. \u201cThe way you did with Sammy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can try,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Hope lit her face, but he held his hand up before she could get carried away. \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up too high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope is all I have right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. Believe me. But there\u2019s a good chance it won\u2019t work because the damage happened so long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how small the chance is. I have to try. Just tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to learn to control my power so you can use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I do that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPractice. We go outside where we won\u2019t blow anything up, and start trying things to see what works. Eventually, you\u2019ll get the hang of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually isn\u2019t good enough. I\u2019ll just have to push myself until I\u2019m able to do whatever it takes to save Nika.\u201d</p><p>Paul wasn\u2019t about to let her hurt herself, but the idea of her needing him was a heady thought. If she needed him, she\u2019d stay with him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t make you any promises, but we\u2019ll do what we can.\u201d</p><p>She turned and looked at him with a kind of frantic desperation. \u201cThis has to work, Paul. It just has to.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Paul knew the truth. If Nika died, Andra would, too. She\u2019d never be able to forgive herself or let go of the pain and move on. The two sisters\u2019 fates were tied together. If Paul wanted her to live, then he had to find a way to save Nika.</p><p>So that was what he\u2019d do. No matter what it took.</p><p>Andra followed Paul out into the night. The house was situated along one side of a cornfield, tucked back behind a clump of tall trees and thick scrub. She couldn\u2019t see the road from here, or any other houses, but there was a faint glow in the distant sky that she guessed belonged to Omaha.</p><p>He led her away from the house and out to the edge of the corn. His hand was warm and solid, and she held on to it like a lifeline. If this failed . . .</p><p>It couldn\u2019t fail. This had to work.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst, you have to get a feel for drawing on the power inside me. Think of it like a big swimming pool filled with energy and you can siphon off as much of it as you want at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I get to it?\u201d</p><p>He slid one finger over the band around her throat. \u201cThe luceria connects us.\u201d He held up his hand and showed her the matching ring. \u201cPower can flow through them, from my ring into your necklace.\u201d</p><p>Andra could almost see it happen as he explained it. It was as if she had been born with the instinctive knowledge of what to do, and that knowledge was just now waking up inside her.</p><p>\u201cTry something simple at first.\u201d He picked a stick up off the ground. \u201cTry to light this on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes and relax.\u201d</p><p>Andra did, and felt his body move until he was standing behind her. His voice was quiet in the darkness, flowing over her skin like a breeze. Crickets chirped all around them, and a soft wind whispered through the cornfield. She could smell the richness of the earth rising up from the warm ground, feel Paul\u2019s strong body pressing close against her back.</p><p>His hands stroked her arms in a slow, lazy rhythm that calmed the beating of her heart. The skin of his palms was slightly rough, totally manly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said against her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great. Now, I want you to focus on the luceria. Feel the weight of it against your skin, the warmth of it as it holds your body\u2019s heat close.\u201d</p><p>She did. She could feel that and so much more. It gave off a subtle vibration so faint she hadn\u2019t noticed before. It was as if the necklace were shaking\u2014about to burst with energy.</p><p>Andra\u2019s mind reached out and touched that energy, and like a shock of static, it gave her a sharp jolt. She jumped back from it and let out a little yelp.</p><p>Paul\u2019s hands tightened on her arms and held her in place. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot, I know. I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s no other way. It\u2019s probably going to hurt a little.\u201d</p><p>Like losing her virginity. Best to just grit her teeth and get it over with so she could get on to the good part.</p><p>Andra made herself reach out for that flow of energy one more time. She braced herself for the shock, and this time it wasn\u2019t so bad. She accepted the pain and let it flow over her, let it fill her up.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now let go of it. Let the power out so it can burn the stick.\u201d</p><p>Andra wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to do that, but she figured she\u2019d better get her aim right. She didn\u2019t want to set the house on fire or singe their toes.</p><p>She looked at the stick and imagined she was Superman, sending out a beam of heat with her eyes.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t even close to what happened. There was no beam and the stick didn\u2019t burst into flames, but it did start to smoke as she felt the power inside her dissipate, making her feel lighter.</p><p>Victory surged through her and she jumped with the thrill of it, only to find that on the way back down, her legs could no longer hold her up.</p><p>Paul\u2019s thick arms caught her and he lowered her to the ground. \u201cEasy, now.\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s head spun a bit and her body felt watery, but she\u2019d still done it. She\u2019d tapped into a source of power that might save Nika.</p><p>Paul held her in his lap as if she were dainty enough to fit, which made her smile. She\u2019d never met a man who made her feel as feminine as he did. She\u2019d worked out and packed on muscle because she needed the strength to fight the monsters, not because she enjoyed it. In fact, it would be kinda nice not to have to pump iron for hours each week just to feel like she had a fighting chance at survival. With Paul and his deadly sword around, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have to.</p><p>It was just three days, she reminded herself. Nothing more. She shouldn\u2019t go getting all excited over changing her lifestyle just because a man was around today. That didn\u2019t mean anything about tomorrow.</p><p>She had to stay strong and keep pushing. Nika needed her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go again,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cGive yourself a minute,\u201d he said as his thumb slid over her arm.</p><p>His touch felt nice. Maybe too nice. She was almost content to sit here all night and let him touch her. Hold her.</p><p>And who was holding Nika? Sure as hell it wasn\u2019t Madoc.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good to go,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I teach you to see in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather learn how to help Nika.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s complex. It\u2019s going to take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time. Nika doesn\u2019t have time. She\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but there\u2019s only so much you can do. You can\u2019t start slinging around the kind of power it\u2019s going to take to help her. Not yet. Our connection is too new and small. You might end up hurting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s stretch it out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. These things take as long as they take.\u201d</p><p>He was hiding something from her. She could feel it. \u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m protecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to protect me. I need to you protect Nika.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his hand to her cheek and the touch felt good. Right. A hum of strength flowed into her and she wanted more. \u201cYou have to come first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen teach me how to get enough power to help her. Without her, I have nothing.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened into a grim, flat line. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon. We shouldn\u2019t force it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that. I want to force it.\u201d She couldn\u2019t sit here in his lap anymore. She had to get up and put some distance between them before she did something she\u2019d regret, like punch him for not cooperating.</p><p>Paul followed her up. His eyes darkened to a rich, chocolate brown, as if the idea of rushing things appealed to him. \u201cIt\u2019s not smart. I won\u2019t take the chance you might do yourself harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your choice. I\u2019m going to do whatever it takes to help Nika. It doesn\u2019t matter how dangerous it is. If I can\u2019t save her, nothing matters. Don\u2019t you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. More than you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen help me.\u201d</p><p>Paul stepped forward. He pressed his hand flat against her chest, just below the luceria and above the swell of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you what you want. More power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis seems like an odd way of\u2014\u201d</p><p>A hot jolt of energy ripped through her, streaking from where his ring hovered near her skin with only the fabric of her shirt between them. The jolt wasn\u2019t exactly pain, but it was one hell of a close cousin.</p><p>Andra was left breathing hard, shaking. Weak. She felt like she\u2019d just run a mile uphill after a bout of stomach flu.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying?\u201d asked Paul with a smug grin lifting his voice.</p> <p>\u201cWas that enough?\u201d she asked, praying it was so. \u201cI sure don\u2019t feel stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. That was a mere spark. If you want to help Nika, it\u2019s going to take a lot more than that. Plus, you\u2019ll have to learn to channel it.\u201d</p><p>Andra wasn\u2019t sure how much more she could take, but she knew how much more she was going to make him give her\u2014enough to fix Nika. \u201cThen teach me.\u201d</p><p>He stared into her eyes, his expression deadly serious. \u201cBe sure, Andra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Paul said, \u201cPut your palm on the ground.\u201d</p><p>She knelt on the ground and speared her fingers through the dry grass so she could feel the dirt. He knelt beside her and his hand pinned hers in place.</p><p>\u201cNow, close your eyes. What do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeeds. It\u2019s warm. A little damp. There\u2019s a rock under my finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the surface. Go deeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t touch anything deeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also can\u2019t touch Nika\u2019s mind, but you have to learn how to feel your way around inside it.\u201d</p><p>Andra got his point. She didn\u2019t tell him she\u2019d been peeking around inside the thoughts of lost children for years. Whatever she was able to do with them didn\u2019t work with Nika\u2014she\u2019d tried\u2014so she made herself concentrate. His body was hot and hard against hers. It was easier to feel his muscular thigh brushing hers than it was to feel inside the ground, but she kept trying. She thought about what it must be like in the ground, all dark and heavy, but she sensed that she still wasn\u2019t getting it right.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m not feeling anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re doing it on your own. You have to use my power. Pull it from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d said Paul. His hand cupped the nape of her neck and she felt his ring hit her necklace and stick like a magnet. He leaned down over her until she could feel his breath fan her cheek, and he placed his free hand next to hers on the ground. Her neck warmed beneath the band, and that warmth spread down her arm and into each fingertip. It wasn\u2019t like the jolt before. It was gentler, or maybe it just felt that way because the power was draining out of her into the ground.</p><p>\u201cCan you feel the soil just below your fingertips?\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded. That part was easy.</p><p>\u201cBelow that is a layer of broken rock. The roots of the plants have dug their way in through tiny cracks, soaking up the water that\u2019s trapped there each time it rains.\u201d</p><p>Andra squeezed her eyes shut and tried to see what he described.</p><p>\u201cAbout thirty feet down there\u2019s a thick slab of stone. Old stone that\u2019s been here since before my grandpar ents were born.\u201d With every word, the power flowing into her seemed to increase. She could feel it expand to fill up her arm and it vibrated faster with each passing second.</p><p>\u201cCan you see it?\u201d he asked in a mere whisper.</p><p>\u201cI can imagine it, but I can\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not letting me in. My power is flowing through you, but you\u2019re not using it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. The inadequacy is mine, but I can fix it.\u201d He pulled in a deep breath. \u201cDon\u2019t fight me. It will be easier if you are accepting.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what he meant until she felt a pressure inside her skull as if something were trying to bore its way in. Her instincts were to fight the invasion, but she tried to let it happen.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d she heard him grate out in a pained tone.</p><p>She let out the breath she was holding and urged her tight muscles to loosen. He wasn\u2019t going to hurt her. Paul would never hurt her.</p><p>The pressure in her head released suddenly and she could feel a sliver of him inside her mind. \u201cJust let me take the wheel,\u201d he said.</p><p>The words echoed in her head as well as in her ears. It was freaky, but nice, too. She felt surrounded. Safe.</p><p>Andra did as he asked, and let her mind wander.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he whispered over her thoughts. \u201cSelfless. Strong. Brave. I\u2019m humbled.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea what he was looking at, but she started to grow uncomfortable with the idea that he could see inside her.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t fight me. I\u2019ll stop poking around, I swear.\u201d</p><p>The presence inside her mind receded, and she could feel him keep his word. Andra relaxed again and let him steer.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She was, but she didn\u2019t have to say the words. He was part of her and already knew.</p><p>\u201cHere we go.\u201d</p><p>She felt another shocking jolt, only this one was less painful, more like a wave of pressure rushing through her. Her eyes felt like they\u2019d be pushed from her head, but there was an odd tingling in them, too. Her lids were still closed, but she saw something huge lurking in front of her.</p><p>Rock.</p><p>\u201cI can see it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood. Tell me what else you see.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure which way to go, so she went down farther, burrowing her way through the solid rock until she came out the bottom. \u201cWater,\u201d she told him. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of water down here. And something shiny.\u201d Or at least it would be shiny if there were any light. \u201cHow can I see without light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really seeing; you\u2019re perceiving it as if you were seeing it, though, since visual stimulus is what your mind is used to interpreting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so cool.\u201d</p><p>She felt him grin against her ear, felt his presence glow with warmth inside her mind. \u201cNow, I want you to pull back until you\u2019re near the soil again, almost at the surface, but not quite.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Andra did as he asked.</p><p>\u201cNow, do you feel all the seeds in the soil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel the seeds?\u201d Andra poked around, trying to figure out what he meant, when she stumbled across one. Life. The potential for life inside the tiny speck was incredible. Powerful and determined, waiting patiently for the right time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cNow tell it to grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the seed to sprout. Bring water up from the ground and convince it to grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I talk to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust try it. I\u2019ll guide you.\u201d</p><p>Andra poked around the little thing with her mind, prodding at it as if to wake it up. Nothing happened. \u201cIt\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not using me. Draw from me the strength you need to make it listen.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to do that, either, but she felt like she should know.</p><p>A warm ring of power glowed around her neck, so she went there first. The luceria could siphon off his power. That was what he\u2019d told her. She concentrated on that ring and imagined plugging a cord into it like she would her TV. At first, she didn\u2019t think anything had happened, but then she felt another one of those waves wash over her.</p><p>She let out a groan and thanked God she was already on the ground. It saved her some time, since that was where she would have ended up anyway. Her head spun as if someone had given her brain a good twist, but she\u2019d connected herself to Paul\u2019s power and stayed that way. She could feel the huge ocean of strength deep inside him, just waiting for her.</p><p>And she wanted it. Craved it. That ocean could save Nika, and if she could have found a way, she would have drained every bit of it from him.</p><p>Problem was, she couldn\u2019t seem to reach it, or at least not much of it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not close enough,\u201d he told her. \u201cNot united the way we need to be for you to get what you want. Yet.\u201d</p><p>Whether it was a promise or a warning, she wasn\u2019t sure, but she felt him slip out of her mind, leaving her oddly alone again.</p><p>She opened her eyes to look at him and ask him what he meant, but she didn\u2019t get that far. The lush, rich carpet of grass and flowers under their bodies distracted her. Even in the dark, she could see the vibrant colors of wildflowers that had not been there moments before.</p><p>\u201cI did that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cSure did.\u201d He pushed to his feet and put plenty of distance between them.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m ready now?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can help Nika?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and his eyes slid away. \u201cIt depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>He shoved his hands through his mussed hair and turned away. It was an evasive maneuver and she knew it.</p><p>Andra grabbed his shoulder and spun him around. \u201cIt depends on what, Paul?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re rushing things.

Let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted as if he\u2019d tasted something bad. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way it works. You can\u2019t just plow through this, or blast your way through with a shotgun. It takes time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got three days. Is that enough?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d he said as he turned away again, his eyes sliding to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you hiding from me?\u201d</p><p>Paul looked over his shoulder and gave her a grim, resigned stare. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t help you do this. I won\u2019t let you hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>Frustration rose up inside her, and she shoved it at him in anger. As childish as it was, she wanted him to suffer as much as she did\u2014she wanted him to know what it was like to have the means to help Nika so close, but still fall short.</p><p>Andra felt her frustration and anger slide through their connection and saw his face darken as he suffered through the gnawing, helpless feeling she\u2019d forced him to endure.</p> <p>Seconds after she\u2019d done it, she already felt bad. It wasn\u2019t his fault she couldn\u2019t do this. It was hers. It had always been her fault when she failed.</p><p>Instinctively, she reached out for his mind, wanting to apologize, hoping to soothe him. He let her in, and his eyes slid shut as if he enjoyed the feeling of having her inside him.</p><p>Andra brushed against his thoughts. There were so many\u2014so many intense feelings she could hardly make sense of any of it. She saw his need to keep her safe glowing like a beacon, shadowing all else. Such devotion was humbling, and she had no idea why he would care so much that she survived. It had something to do with the energy pulsing within him, but she couldn\u2019t sort out the knot of thoughts and feelings enough to figure it out.</p><p>There was something else looming inside him, too. Something darker that hid behind that beacon. Andra reached for it and felt a hint of knowledge flicker through it\u2014knowledge he was hiding from her.</p><p>Curious, Andra got closer to it and studied it. She felt Paul try to push her out of his mind, but she dug in her heels and refused to leave. She needed to learn what this thing was he was hiding and why it was so important to him to keep it from her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d she heard him say, but ignored it.</p> <p>She shielded her eyes from the glowing light and took hold of the hidden knowledge with an unbreakable grip.</p><p>His power. She could have it all if she were close enough to him. That was what he\u2019d been hiding.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not ready,\u201d he gritted out between clenched teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>Trust, love, intimacy. That was what she needed to have to strengthen their connection enough for her to save Nika. No wonder he said it would take time. Those things couldn\u2019t be had overnight. At least, not all of them.</p><p>Intimacy. Sex. She could share that with him.</p><p>Andra felt another strong push against her as he tried to drive her from the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t want you whoring yourself out like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want you,\u201d she said, though whether it was her voice or her mind speaking, she couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cI don\u2019t normally have sex with men I\u2019ve just met, but I\u2019ll make an exception for you.\u201d For Nika.</p><p>\u201cSex and intimacy aren\u2019t necessarily the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there\u2019s only one way to find out if it\u2019s close enough.\u201d</p><p>Paul groaned and she felt a wave of desire rise up inside him, eclipsing that glowing beacon. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be this way between us. I wanted to do it right this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight is whatever works.\u201d Whatever saved Nika.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have sex with you because you think it will save your sister,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t. Have sex with me because I want it. Because you want it, too.\u201d And just to be sure he did, she nestled her body against his. While locked inside his mind, she couldn\u2019t see him clearly, but she could feel the heat of his body\u2014feel his powerful muscles trembling as he fought himself.</p><p>With an almost violent force of will, Paul pushed her from his thoughts and she landed hard back inside her body. For a brief moment, the place felt odd to her, not quite like the home it had always been. But as soon as she felt it, the sensation faded and everything went back to normal.</p><p>Paul stood before her, his hands locked around her biceps. She could feel his arms shaking as if he couldn\u2019t decide whether to pull her closer or push her away.</p><p>Andra didn\u2019t need any help deciding what she wanted. He was standing right in front of her\u2014a heady combination of noble sacrifice and raw physical power. He was the kind of man women could only dream about, the kind who existed only in fantasy, and yet he stood before her, solid and real, and the answer to every one of her prayers.</p><p>She reached up and laced her fingers around his neck. His hands dropped to his sides and curled into fists. He was stiff and unyielding in her arms, but Andra didn\u2019t relent. She went up on her tiptoes and pressed a soft kiss at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>His lips tightened, but she felt his abdomen clench and knew he was fighting himself. He wanted her.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is give in. Give me what I want,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Paul clamped his eyes shut and sucked in a quick breath.</p><p>Andra moved lower, kissing her way along his angular jawline until she reached his neck, just below his ear. Her tongue flicked out, just barely grazing his skin. \u201cI know you want it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want isn\u2019t important.\u201d He was winded, and she swore she could hear his resolve weakening with every beat of his heart.</p><p>\u201cIt is to me. I know you\u2019ll be careful with me.\u201d Andra gathered his fist in her hands and unclenched his fingers. She kissed his palm, then settled his hand over her heart so his fingers cupped the swell of her breast. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>Those three words broke him. She felt him crumble, and his face changed from a mask of steely determination to a look of unrelenting hunger. He grabbed a fistful of her short hair and angled her head back, forcing her to look into his eyes. There was no mercy there. Not anymore.</p><p>His voice was a low rumble, almost menacing in its ferocity. \u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>Andra was going to get what she wanted. She only hoped she was woman enough to take it.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Madoc was ready to storm out of the room and leave Nika to fend for herself.</p><p>Freaking lunatic chick nearly scalded his balls off with a bowl of soup, and now she was eyeing the spoon like she had plans for that as well.</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen,\u201d he warned her.</p><p>Nika glared at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me drink your blood no matter how well you disguise it.\u201d</p><p>So far, he\u2019d been Mr. Nice Guy\u2014or at least nice for him\u2014but that wasn\u2019t working, so it was time to move on to plan B.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my blood. The Sanguinar can\u2019t have it and neither can you. Now settle the fuck down and eat something.\u201d</p><p>Nika clamped her lips shut. She probably hadn\u2019t meant to dare him like that, but too bad for her. She had.</p><p>Madoc eyed her frail body. He hated to manhandle her. She looked like she\u2019d snap in two if he brushed against her skin, which was why he\u2019d be careful not to do that, even by accident.</p><p>But what choice did he have now? He had to get some food in her or she was going to drop dead, and that couldn\u2019t happen. She might be able to save the life of one of his brothers.</p><p>Maybe even him.</p><p>Madoc looked at his ring again for the fifty billionth time in the past ten minutes. Nothing. No swirling colors, no vibration. Not a fucking thing. All he saw was that what little color was left had faded even more since yesterday\u2014the colors dying as his soul did.</p><p>A vicious flare of rage filled him up until he wanted to scream and break the furniture and pound his fists into the walls until there was nothing left but dust and blood. It wasn\u2019t fair. After all these centuries of loyal service, of working and sweating and bleeding to do his sworn duty, it wasn\u2019t fair that she couldn\u2019t be the one to save him. Ease his pain.</p><p>It was the Solarc\u2019s sick joke, no doubt. Someone needed to bust through the gate and pound the king of Athanasia\u2019s ass hard. Madoc didn\u2019t care if he was the Solarc\u2019s descendant. Fucker deserved a good, thorough beating.</p><p>A soft gasp brought his attention back to Nika. He\u2019d mutilated the spoon he\u2019d been holding\u2014bent it until it was no longer usable.</p><p>Fuck. At least he hadn\u2019t been touching her at the time. He would have done the same thing to her fingers or arm.</p><p>Madoc flung the spoon across the room. Nika\u2019s blue eyes widened and she tried to move away from him across the bed.</p><p>No more. He was through playing. \u201cEnough fucking around, Nika. You\u2019re going to eat and get strong and figure out which one of the men you can save once we get back to Dabyr. Got that? I\u2019m not going to let you starve yourself to death.\u201d</p><p>She was still wide-eyed and shaking, and knowing he\u2019d done it made whatever sliver of his soul was left alive shudder in disgust.</p><p>Madoc pulled in a deep breath and gathered every bit of patience he could find. What he really needed was to spend a few hours pumping iron, then a few more pumping into a woman. He didn\u2019t need to be playing nursemaid.</p><p>But he was, and he was stuck, so he reached out slowly and wrapped his hand around her wrist, which was about as big around as two of his fingers and a hell of a lot more fragile.</p><p>Nika froze inside his grasp and her eyes kinda rolled back in her head. Her whole body started shaking and she let out a jagged cry of pain.</p><p>Madoc let go as if she were on fire. \u201cOh, God. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he heard himself saying, expecting blood to start shooting out of her arm where he\u2019d touched her. He must have broken a bone or something, but he didn\u2019t see any sign of a break. Not even a red mark.</p><p>She flopped around on the bed, sending food flying everywhere. When she started scooting off the side, Madoc rushed around the bed and kept her from falling off.</p><p>Maybe she was having some kind of seizure and it had nothing to do with him.</p><p>Yeah, right. And he was going to live happily ever after, too, surrounded by bunnies and kittens and puppies and all the cotton candy he could eat.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t do something, she was going to hurt herself, so he crawled on the bed and pinned the blankets down over her body, using his arms and legs to pull the fabric tight, being careful not to touch her again.</p><p>Slowly, the shaking stopped and her body went still. He couldn\u2019t tell if she was breathing, and panic filled him up until he was sweating it through his pores.</p><p>Madoc pressed his ear over her heart, desperate to hear a beat, feel her chest rise with her breath. Something.</p><p>Seconds passed and he thought he felt something, but he wasn\u2019t sure. Then he heard a faint pulse and her tight little nipple pressed against his cheek as she pulled in a deep breath.</p><p>Madoc\u2019s eyes closed with relief. He hadn\u2019t killed her.</p><p>She shifted against his hold on the blankets, so he sat up, still straddling her legs, but not putting any weight on her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her skin was pale and her eyes were glassy, but she stared at him, and for the first time tonight, she looked lucid. \u201cThirsty,\u201d she whispered in a dry voice. \u201cCan I have some water?\u201d</p><p>Madoc nodded and eased off the bed. He retrieved the spilled cup from the floor, rinsed it out, and filled it up at the bathroom sink. As he was coming back, he saw Nika try to sit up and fail. Her arms weren\u2019t strong enough to support even her meager weight.</p><p>Which meant he was going to have to touch her again. Holy fuck, he didn\u2019t want to do that. Not that what he wanted had ever really mattered in the scheme of things.</p><p>He set the cup down and slid his arm beneath her shoulders to lift her up. She was bony as hell and weighed about as much as his cheerful disposition. He held the cup for her so she wouldn\u2019t spill\u2014not that it would matter with the mess of food the bed was already covered in. She emptied the cup and slumped as if even that small effort had drained her.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she told him, and still she seemed sane.</p><p>It creeped him out more than a little.</p><p>\u201cCan I have some toast or crackers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to eat?\u201d asked Madoc, unable to hide his shock.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not too much trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Trouble? Just what the fuck did she think was all over the bed? Looked like a whole hell of a lot of trouble to him. \u201cYou gonna throw it at me or try to chop my dick off with the edge of the cracker?\u201d</p><p>This time she was the one looking at him as if he were crazy. \u201cThat isn\u2019t my first choice, no. I\u2019d rather eat it.\u201d</p><p>A package of crackers had come along with all of the other food. Madoc found it under a bowl of macaroni and cheese and wiped off the majority of the mess with his shirt, adding to the mix of foods soiling it. He tore the plastic open and held out the sleeve to her.</p><p>She reached for it, but her hand was shaking so hard, Madoc pulled it away. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he told her, sounding disgusted.</p><p>He pulled a saltine out and held it to her mouth. She took a bite, chewed, and her eyes closed on a blissful moan. \u201cGod, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Madoc frowned at the cracker and looked at it, searching for the secret ingredient that made her so happy. Whatever it was, he\u2019d like to cover himself with it and let her lick it\u2014</p> <p>Holy hell. He was so not going to go there with her. Not in a million years. Not if every hooker on the face of the planet keeled over and he had no one left to fuck.</p><p>Nika was clean. Precious. Breakable. And not his.</p><p>Besides, he didn\u2019t like bony chicks. At least, he didn\u2019t think he did. His dick thought different, but then it had always had a mind of its own.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Madoc fed her another bite and watched her eat. She was pretty enough, though he imagined that with an extra twenty or thirty pounds she\u2019d be drop-dead gorgeous. Way out of his league.</p><p>Besides, even if she were stronger, she\u2019d probably still be too fragile for the kind of fucking he liked to give\u2014hard and fast and often. Hell, she\u2019d probably be the kind of woman who wanted him to stick around afterward to cuddle, too. He couldn\u2019t stand that shit. He just wanted to get off and get out.</p><p>The line of thought made his cock throb, and the remains of the cracker turned to powder in his grasp. He shifted his hips so she couldn\u2019t see his boner and grabbed another saltine.</p><p>After eating about six of the crackers, she fizzled out as if she were full.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think I could convince you to run me a bath?\u201d she asked, looking at the food stains on her clothes. \u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re up to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not up to sleeping in this filth all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have time, I\u2019m sure Andra will help me.\u201d</p><p>Like hell. This was his job tonight, and he was damn well going to do it. \u201cShe\u2019s busy.\u201d</p><p>Nika gave a little hurt frown that made him want to kiss it away.</p><p>Whoa. He really was losing it. Since when did he want to kiss anyone? He couldn\u2019t even stand to kiss the women he screwed.</p><p>A hopeful suspicion lit him up and he looked down at his ring again for some kind of sign. Nothing. Not a fucking thing.</p><p>Hope died a swift death, which was exactly as it should be.</p><p>Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.</p><p>Andra was swiftly having second thoughts about taunting Paul\u2014practically daring him to have sex with her. Something in him had changed the moment he\u2019d given her that warning. She saw it in his eyes, a kind of predatory glow lighting the golden chips. Even his posture had changed. He was no longer offering her comfort. His hold on her was hot and hard. Possessive.</p><p>Andra tried to shift, but his grip tightened. His thick arm wrapped around her back and held her in place. His other hand was still clenched around her hair, holding her so tight it almost hurt. She probably could have escaped if she\u2019d really put her mind to it, but she wasn\u2019t sure how long her escape would last. That predatory vibe coming off him was strong, warning her that if she tried to run, he\u2019d be right behind her. And those long, powerful legs of his would have no trouble catching her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>His voice was quiet, so she had to strain to hear over the singing crickets. \u201cGiving you what you want. The power to help Nika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Okay. I can deal with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it takes?\u201d he asked, and his mouth brushed her ear, his words trickling into her like a dark seduction.</p><p>Andra\u2019s stomach tightened and her voice dried up. She nodded.</p><p>He let go of her hair and moved around her body until his fingers encircled her throat, covering the luceria. Sparks leaped from his fingertips and sank into her, sliding down her body and into the earth. She stiffened at the intensity, but Paul soothed her with small strokes of his thumb. \u201cShhh. I\u2019ll stop if you want, and we\u2019ll go inside. We can try another day.\u201d</p><p>Nika didn\u2019t have many days left if things didn\u2019t change. \u201cJust get on with it. I can take it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and she felt the vibration all the way to her toes. This man was swiftly going to her head, and she wasn\u2019t sure how safe that was for her.</p><p>His thumb continued to stroke a lazy path over her neck. She fought the urge to squirm so he\u2019d move lower.</p><p>\u201cSo brave on the outside. But I know how you really feel. Your heart is racing,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019d almost think you were afraid.\u201d</p><p>Pride rose up inside her, making her spine straighten. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. I just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d he said as he lowered his head toward hers.</p><p>It was no gentle, coaxing kiss, as before. It was hot and demanding, and stole the breath from her lungs. He thrust his tongue inside and pressed his body down upon hers, forcing her legs wide to make room for him.</p><p>She probably should have shoved him away for being so forward, but she didn\u2019t want to, God help her. She wanted what he was giving her, and then some.</p><p>A moment later, another wave of energy rushed through her and left her shaking in its wake. Her body felt as if it were on fire, burning from the inside out. An achy hollowness settled low in her belly, and she needed to find a way to make it stop. Not being one for long-term relationships, Andra knew sexual frustration, but this was beyond anything she\u2019d ever felt before. This was not a want, but a need, like breathing.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to feel this desperate for anyone, but she didn\u2019t have much of a choice. Not anymore.</p><p>She ground herself against his thigh, trying to find some kind of relief, but there was none to be had that way. There were too many clothes blocking her skin. She needed more contact. More friction.</p><p>A rough moan rose up out of her, shocking her with the frantic, needy sound.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Paul murmured against her mouth. \u201cNow we\u2019re getting there.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know exactly what he meant by that, but she didn\u2019t really care anymore. She needed to get him naked and inside her. Right now.</p><p>Andra pulled at his shirt and heard fabric rip under the force of her desperation. The fabric fell away from his chest, revealing the tree tattoo she\u2019d seen earlier, only now it was no longer bare. Small buds had formed all along the branches, making it look almost fuzzy.</p><p>She ran her finger over it, distracted from his body by the way it had changed. \u201cMore magic?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing compared to what\u2019s in store for you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Paul had to pace himself or he was going to hurt her. He wanted her too much. Needed her. He thought it was bad before, but now that he\u2019d seen inside her mind, it was much, much worse.</p><p>She was beautiful inside. So caring and generous. So afraid of being alone. So afraid of failing Nika again. That fear made all of Paul\u2019s oversize protective instincts stand up and roar. He was going to make sure she was never alone again\u2014that her family was safe. Whatever it took, whatever it cost, Paul was going to protect her from the one thing she feared most. Losing Nika.</p><p>He had no idea how he was going to do it, but he would find a way. They\u2019d find a way together.</p><p>And he was going to start by making sure she could use as much of his power as she could stand. It was what they both wanted. All he had to do was make sure he held back enough that she didn\u2019t end up getting hurt.</p><p>He opened his eyes and stared down at her. She was so beautiful in the moonlight he could hardly believe she was real. Her cheeks were flushed and her mouth was open, her breath coming in fast, panting bursts. He swore he could almost see the shimmer of heat rising from her skin.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>She\u2019d taken his luceria, and that made her his. Bound her to him.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d he ordered. He\u2019d been dying to kiss her all night and hadn\u2019t had nearly enough to appease him. Not even close.</p><p>A look of concern crossed her face. \u201cPaul, are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen. Your. Mouth.\u201d</p><p>She did, just a little, and Paul kissed her deep and hard. She hadn\u2019t opened wide enough for him, so he urged her to give him more. Take more.</p><p>She tasted so damn good, he\u2019d never get enough of her. He licked along her lips and tilted her head back so he could get a better, deeper angle. Her soft sigh told him she didn\u2019t mind one bit. In fact, her arms came around his neck and she held him tight, as if trying to keep him from getting away.</p><p>Like he\u2019d stop now. Not a chance. He had warned her this might not be safe, but she hadn\u2019t listened, and now she deserved everything she got.</p><p>Heat poured off of him until he thought he\u2019d combust. His dick strained against his jeans, begging for release. His heart pounded hard and fast, and the power inside him swelled and pulsed as if it knew what he had planned for her and couldn\u2019t wait to be let free.</p><p>Paul shoved her shirt and bra up, baring her breasts to the moonlight. She was beautiful here, too. Perfectly shaped to fill his hand, her nipples puckered and tight. It wasn\u2019t cold out here, which left only one other reason. She wanted this, too. Maybe not as much as he did, but he was going to fix that.</p><p>He covered her breast with his palm, groaning at the intoxicating feel of her naked skin against his. Her tight nipple jutted up into his hand, making him crazy. He knew his hands were rough from years of combat, but he didn\u2019t care. He had to touch her, feel her naked skin against his own. He rubbed his palm across her nipple, making her suck in a sharp breath. His mind was too fogged to figure out whether that sound was good or bad, but he knew one thing she\u2019d like for sure\u2014one place he wasn\u2019t too rough for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled his mouth away from hers and eased down her body, moving all of her bunched-up clothes out of his way, over her head and arms. Paul swept his tongue across her nipple. Andra\u2019s hips bucked and she ripped the clothes from her arms and grabbed fistfuls of his hair, holding him to her.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>Paul happily complied and covered her with his mouth, pulling on her hard.</p><p>Her fingernails bit into his scalp and she let out the most beautiful sound of pleasure he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>Deep inside him, something was happening\u2014something truly wonderful\u2014but he didn\u2019t know what it was. He couldn\u2019t think straight. Not with his mouth latched onto her breast and her body writhing under his. Not with the moonlight bathing her skin and the scent of her arousal heavy in the night air.</p><p>Power flowed out of him, trickling into her everywhere their bare skin touched. It was erotic feeling her soaking it up, feeling her accept what he needed to give her.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She breathed in and he felt her hold her breath for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s what you meant.\u201d</p><p>Paul couldn\u2019t speak. His throat was too tight with the need to shove more power into her and force her to take it all. Only his need to protect her held him back and allowed him a precious measure of control.</p><p>The ferocious need to take her welled up inside him. If she couldn\u2019t take more power, she was damn well going to take his cock inside her as deep as it could go.</p><p>His fingers went to the waistband of her jeans, desperate to get her naked. He wanted to feel her skin against his and find out if she was as wet and ready for him as he needed her to be. He didn\u2019t think he could be gentle anymore. Not the first time. Maybe after a few rounds, after he\u2019d ground down the rougher edges of his need.</p><p>She stiffened and moved to stop his hand, but Paul brushed off her attempt. She tried again and he growled his frustration while he captured her hands and pinned them over her head against her discarded shirt.</p><p>\u201cPaul.\u201d She whispered his name as if she were frightened.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to stop, but he was compelled by his vow to look around and find out what had scared her. Once he killed it, he could get back to her sweet, firm body.</p><p>When he looked around, he saw nothing. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked her in a voice thick with need.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding me down.\u201d</p><p>So? She\u2019d tried to stop him. What did she expect him to do?</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d Her eyes were wide and bright with banked fear.</p><p>Paul looked at where his hand shackled her wrists. His hold was tight enough to bruise. Tight enough to hurt her.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d growled Paul. He let her go and shoved himself away from her. He was going too fast in his desperation. Forcing her. That hadn\u2019t been his intention.</p><p>Had it?</p><p>His erection throbbed in time with his racing pulse and his skin was fever-hot. Inside, he was shaking with need, but he managed to lie still on the dry grass and not jump her again.</p><p>Her face came into his line of sight and she wore a tentative, worried frown. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Paul shut his eyes. He couldn\u2019t even look at her without fighting the need to stake his claim. And even when he closed his eyes, he could still feel her skin under his hands and her nipple against his tongue. Those were not the kinds of things a man forgot.</p> <p>She touched his face, and he gritted his teeth against the urge to throw her back down and take her hard and fast, before she had a chance to stop him.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to stop, but slower is good,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you go slower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. I don\u2019t know what you do to me, but I\u2019m dying here. I need to be inside you.\u201d Just saying it nearly turned him inside out with lust.</p><p>Andra pulled in a shaky breath. Her breast brushed his arm, and he could feel the silky smoothness of her skin. She was still shirtless.</p><p>Paul opened his eyes to look because there was no other choice. He had to see her bare breasts.</p><p>She watched him stare and went up to her knees. \u201cSlower, okay?\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded, unable to speak. He wasn\u2019t sure if he could slow down, but he knew he\u2019d try. He\u2019d do just about anything to get her back under him where she belonged.</p><p>Before he could find the will to move, Andra straddled his hips. \u201cIt worked,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat worked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntimacy.\u201d She took his hand and pressed it to her breast. \u201cWhen you kissed me here, I felt it\u2014felt our connection get stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should do it again, just to be sure.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sultry smile that made him want to feel her lips wrap around his cock while she sucked him off. His whole body shook with the effort to stay still and not force her to do just that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man.\u201d</p><p>She stroked her fingers over his lifemark, trailing down toward his jeans. \u201cYou\u2019re still beautiful. All hard and muscular. It\u2019s a real turn-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so turned on, then you won\u2019t mind letting me feel. Are you wet, Andra?\u201d</p><p>She held his stare as she unbuttoned her jeans and slid the zipper down so slowly it made his balls ache. Instead of letting him do the job, she eased her hand inside her panties. Her eyes went heavy and her head fell back as she moved her fingers over her own skin.</p><p>Paul couldn\u2019t take any more. Not one second. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her hand out. Her fingers glistened with her arousal in the moonlight. He\u2019d done that to her. He\u2019d made her wet and now he was going to taste her.</p><p>He took her fingers into his mouth and nearly came right there. She tasted of salt and woman and unsated need. But not for long. He\u2019d satisfy her and fill her up with his seed so there\u2019d be no more question that she was his woman. She\u2019d smell like his. Taste like his. Be his.</p><p>Andra watched him with heavy-lidded eyes and he could feel her jeans rasping against his stomach as her hips shifted like they had a mind of their own.</p><p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d ordered Paul. \u201cI want you naked.\u201d</p><p>Andra lifted a brow in challenge. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>Whatever got her naked worked for him. Paul unfastened his sword belt and set it within easy reach. As soon as it left his body, the weapon became visible, displaying the intricate carvings of vines on the scabbard. He shoved his jeans and boots off just in time to watch her do the same.</p><p>She was still wearing her panties, but she tossed the rest of her clothes aside and her eyes fixed on his heavy erection. It bobbed in answer to her eager stare. \u201cIf you keep looking, I\u2019m going to disgrace myself.\u201d</p><p>A smile of pure womanly greed curved her mouth. \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d She reached out and wrapped her fingers around him, making him suck in a hard breath. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later,\u201d he told her, and pushed her back down in the soft, thick grass. \u201cRight now, I have other plans.\u201d</p><p>She stroked him with her fist. Her fingers were just long enough to do the job right, and they felt like heaven. Paul had to clench his teeth to stop himself from coming all over her hand.</p><p>He pulled her hand away and his dick gave a throb of resentment, which he ignored.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still wearing your panties,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shy.\u201d</p><p>Paul let out a bark of laughter he couldn\u2019t contain. There wasn\u2019t a shy bone in her body. She was teasing him and that was fine. Two could play that game.</p><p>He kissed her mouth until she was breathless, and then moved down her neck and over her collarbone. He loved each breast with his mouth and tongue, pulling sweet moans of pleasure from her until he couldn\u2019t take any more. He trailed kisses down her ribs and over her taut belly, sliding her panties off as he descended.</p><p>Her legs were long and muscular, like the rest of her. But even with all those feminine muscles, she was still woman-soft, woman-smooth. He had to touch her and soak up the feel of her skin beneath his. He wasn\u2019t sure he was ever going to get enough of her, but he was damn well going to try.</p><p>He went back up her body, spreading her legs as he caressed them. Every inch higher he went drew a new shiver from her, another soft moan. Restraint nearly killed him. It would have been so easy to just slide right inside her. But she\u2019d asked him to go slower, so he would.</p><p>When his finger slid over her sex, opening her slick folds, she jumped at the contact.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed on a long sigh as her body went limp.</p><p>Paul wasn\u2019t waiting for an invitation. He parted her legs wide enough to make room for his shoulders and settled between them. The grass tickled his body, but it was soft enough that he didn\u2019t worry about Andra\u2019s back. He could ride her as hard as he wanted and not fear hurting her. Which was good. He didn\u2019t trust his restraint to hold once he felt her body close around his dick.</p><p>The scent of her heated body made his head spin and his mouth water. He parted her flesh, and Andra\u2019s body tensed. He didn\u2019t know if it was because she was eager or anxious, but he pressed soft, soothing kisses along the insides of her thighs to quiet her so she\u2019d let him do as he pleased with her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work. She was strung tight, vibrating with tension.</p><p>His mind wanted to relax her and ease her anxiety, but his body had other ideas. He needed to taste her again, to make her come. After an orgasm or two, she\u2019d be plenty relaxed.</p><p>The idea was too potent to resist, so he didn\u2019t. He pushed her legs high and wide and held them there while he took her with his mouth.</p><p>Andra grabbed his hair in her fists and let out a sharp cry of need. Her hips bucked beneath him and he gripped her tight to hold her still while he flicked his tongue over her sensitive little nub.</p><p>Then he felt it. She was poking at his mind frantically, trying to find her way inside.</p><p>Kate had never wanted that closeness with him. She\u2019d always kept her distance. Cold and aloof. She\u2019d never so much as let him kiss her.</p><p>But not Andra. She was trying to get closer to him, trying to become a part of him. Paul\u2019s soul swelled with satisfaction and he let her in, feeling a dark grin stretch his mouth. He had nothing to hide from her\u2014not anymore\u2014but he guided her toward what he wanted her to see most. She was going to see all of him, feel his desire for her, and it would magnify her own.</p><p>In her innocence, she didn\u2019t realize he was funneling her through his thoughts, steering her toward his vibrant, consuming need to have her and keep her forever. She went along easily and he let her feel it, let go of his control and let her feel how much he wanted her.</p><p>A raw moan escaped her lips, and she arched into him, holding his head tight against her. As if he needed any encouragement. He could feel how close she was, how much she wanted it. Needed it. Her body was trembling on the brink, and all it would take was the slightest push to send her over.</p><p>Paul\u2019s dick throbbed as he slid a finger inside her tight, hot body. She let out an almost pained whimper, so he suckled her hard, giving her what she needed. That was all it took.</p><p>He felt her orgasm sweep over her, felt her muscles tighten as it crashed against her. She let out a loud cry of release that made Paul\u2019s world shift beneath him. The echo hadn\u2019t even died down yet and already he wanted to make her do it again. And again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her body relaxed beneath him, going soft and pliant. She was still hovering inside his mind, but her presence was faint and content. Her legs were splayed wide, her sex glistening in the moonlight.</p><p>If he\u2019d been a better man, he would have moved away and let her rest. But he wasn\u2019t better. He needed her too much. Sweat beaded up on his skin and his muscles were knotted with pain. He had to have her. Now, before she had the chance to deny him.</p><p>He kissed his way back up her body, praying she\u2019d understand his need.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he grated out as he aligned his body to fit hers.</p> <p>She opened her eyes. Paul expected to see shock or maybe even revulsion, but instead, she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him toward her. His hips moved of their own accord, easing his erection inside her. She was snug, but relaxed, and so wet he slid in without hurting her. Thank God.</p><p>His arms shook with restraint as he braced his weight over her body. He was dying to shove deeper and rut inside her, but he held back. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he found the strength to ask.</p><p>She purred and arched her back so he slid deeper. Paul sucked in a breath and gritted his teeth to stave off his orgasm for just a little longer. As much as he needed to come, he needed to be sure this would not be a one-time thing. It had to be good for her. He had only a few days to prove to her that she couldn\u2019t live without him, and jerking off inside her in thirty seconds flat was not the way to do that.</p><p>He stilled his body and concentrated on her face, the smooth curve of her cheek, the soft swell of her mouth, the way her eyelids fluttered when his cock twitched inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not moving,\u201d she whispered, and tightened her muscles around him.</p> <p>Paul gasped for air. \u201cI\u2019m trying to hold on to a little control here. You\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your control. I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be too rough right now.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sexy, knowing smile. \u201cRough is nice once in a while.\u201d She caught his bottom lip between her teeth and slid her tongue across it before letting it go. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m tough. I can take it.\u201d</p><p>Not only could she take it; she wanted to. He could see the desire shining in her eyes, feel it flickering through their connection.</p><p>Paul\u2019s control broke open. He slid from her body and surged back into her again, forcing her to take all of him. Andra\u2019s eyes widened and her pupils dilated as he held himself deep inside her and ground his hips against her.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she breathed, and clutched at his ass. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>He complied, but not because she asked. He had no choice. His instincts were raging now, his body moving hard and fast in response. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he thought he should be doing something else. Kissing her, petting her? He was no longer sure. Nothing mattered but the tight grip of her sex around his cock and the slippery heat forming between them. She was tight and slick, and her body cushioned his thrusts, accepting whatever he gave her.</p><p>The base of his spine tightened and sparks formed in his vision. He was close and he wanted her right there with him, plunging over the edge.</p><p>Paul forced his way into her mind and let her feel what he was feeling. He channeled his power into her body, stretching the boundaries of their link as hard as he could, forcing her to take more than she ever had before. Andra cried out against the pressure, but he didn\u2019t relent. This was what she wanted\u2014what she needed to help Nika\u2014and he was going to give it to her.</p><p>Her body bowed up off the ground, lifting his hips with her. It buried him deep inside her, and Paul was lost, reveling in the feelings of his body and mind as they filled her up. His orgasm grabbed him by the throat and choked the air from his body. He shoved her back to the ground and seated himself to the hilt while his seed shot into her.</p><p>Pulses of power filled her in time with those of his body until he could feel her straining against the sensation. It was too much for her, and she followed him, crying out as her climax rocked her hips against his. Her stomach tightened rhythmically and a shimmering light flowed up her arms and out of her fingertips, sinking into the earth.</p><p>Slowly, the light faded and silence descended over them. Even the crickets were still. A soft breeze cooled his skin while he struggled to slow his uneven breathing.</p><p>He\u2019d had centuries of sex and it had never been like that. Either it had something to do with the connection they shared, or he\u2019d been doing something really wrong for a really long time.</p> <p>\u201cI think you killed me,\u201d she said. Her voice was hoarse and raspy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but what a way to go.\u201d Paul eased himself from her body, but didn\u2019t go far. The raw, savage need he\u2019d felt was gone now, but when he looked at her spent, damp body lying there and saw the proof of their union shining on his cock and her thighs, he knew it wouldn\u2019t be gone long. She was his now and he wasn\u2019t going to let her forget it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a bit possessive, huh?\u201d she asked him without opening her eyes.</p><p>She\u2019d felt his thoughts. Paul reveled in the knowledge that they were close enough that she could. \u201cAbsolutely. I suggest you get used to it.\u201d</p><p>A small smile lifted one side of her mouth. \u201cA girl could get used to that kind of sex really fast.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, Paul was hard and ready to go again. \u201cIt won\u2019t ever be like that with anyone else,\u201d he told her. He sounded harsh, almost angry, but had to let her know he wasn\u2019t replaceable.</p><p>She cracked one eye open. \u201cDown, boy. I\u2019m not running off. You can relax.\u201d</p><p>No, he couldn\u2019t, but if he didn\u2019t back off, he was going to scare her away or piss her off so badly she\u2019d never let him have her like that again. And that couldn\u2019t happen. He had to get a grip. Fast.</p><p>She pushed herself up and looked down between her thighs. A shocked look crossed her face, then faded to distress. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I forgot to make you cover up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover up?\u201d He didn\u2019t know what she meant, but she seemed so upset he needed to fix it. Whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wear a condom. Please tell me you aren\u2019t suffering from some sort of magical crotch rot.\u201d</p><p>Paul blinked, at a total loss. His body was still humming along and his mind had yet to catch up and get its share of blood supply. \u201cMagical what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSTDs,\u201d she said, as if he should know what she meant. \u201cYou know, venereal diseases.\u201d</p><p>Finally, it sank in. \u201cOh, I get it. Human diseases. No, you don\u2019t have to worry. Our kind doesn\u2019t get sick\u2014at least not like that.\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know any more right now. Maybe later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you a child, either,\u201d he told her out of obligation. He knew it might mean she left him for a man who could father her children, but he had to take that chance. It was something too big for him to ignore.</p><p>She went still and cocked her head to the side. \u201cAre you serious, or are you just saying that so I\u2019ll let you get away without wearing a condom again? Because that ain\u2019t happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wear a hazmat suit and a tutu if that\u2019s what it takes to get back inside your sweet body. Whatever you want. But I am serious. Our men can\u2019t father children. Something was done to us. We don\u2019t know what, but we\u2019re all sterile now.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at that and reached for him. Maybe she\u2019d felt his anger that he\u2019d been robbed of that joy, or maybe something on his face had given him away. He wasn\u2019t sure. But whatever it was, she was stroking his hand as if offering condolences, which he guessed was fitting. The absence of life was nearly as desolate as the loss of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I mean, I\u2019m not looking to be a mom right now, and with the crazy way my life is, probably not ever, but at least I have a choice. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. But that\u2019s old news. No sense dwelling on it. I just thought you should know.\u201d</p><p>She was oddly quiet for a moment as she gathered her clothes. When she turned back around, her eyes were bright, as if she\u2019d been staving off tears. \u201cYou know, in a way, you\u2019re lucky. You\u2019ll never have to worry that your child will be snatched away from you in the dead of night, or that they\u2019ll come back to you a drooling, terrorized shell of what they once were. You\u2019ll never have to worry whether you\u2019re good enough to keep them safe and protect them from danger. You\u2019ll never have to know the anguish of failing them.\u201d</p><p>She was talking about her sister Tori now\u2014the one who\u2019d been taken that night eight years ago. He knew because he\u2019d seen it happen, and felt her guilt over not being strong enough to stop it.</p><p>Paul pulled her into his arms because he couldn\u2019t not hold her. She needed him now, and it was his duty\u2014his honor\u2014to give her whatever she needed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t fail your sisters,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYes. I did. I still am failing Nika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d said Paul. \u201cYou\u2019re stronger now. We\u2019re stronger now. We can try again.\u201d</p><p>She let out a shuddering breath and clung to him with desperate strength. \u201cWhat if I fail again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do, but you can\u2019t lose hope. I know people who may be able to help her even if we can\u2019t. We\u2019ll do whatever it takes, okay?\u201d</p><p>He felt her nod against his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much more hope I\u2019ve got in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, tightening his hold. \u201cI\u2019ll hope enough for both of us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Prince Eron stood on the balcony overlooking the city below. Frigid wind whipped his long hair about his head and made his eyes sting. The twin moons were both waning. Tomorrow, the gate to Earth would open and he would go through to find his daughters. It would be summer there, if his calendar was correct\u2014the eighth summer since he\u2019d last seen his girls.</p><p>Not even a year had passed on Athanasia since the Synestryn attack on his Earth family. Certainly not long enough for him to stop grieving for Celine. To stop missing her with every breath he drew.</p><p>Heavy footsteps sounded behind him on the stone floor.</p><p>Eron didn\u2019t even need to turn around to see the look of displeasure on his older brother\u2019s face. He could hear it hanging heavy in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not going,\u201d said Lucien.</p><p>\u201cYes. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe. It could kill you.\u201d</p><p>Anger welled up inside Eron, but he tried to control it. If he were going to survive the trip through the gate, he needed to remain calm and focused. \u201cNot knowing if my daughters are alive or dead is killing me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find them for you and report back. It\u2019s safer that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they need me?\u201d</p><p>Lucien\u2019s broad hand settled on Eron\u2019s shoulder. His voice softened with understanding. \u201cThat\u2019s the risk we all took when we decided to walk this path. We knew our children would grow up not knowing us. It\u2019s the price we must pay.\u201d</p><p>Eron spun around, knocking his half brother\u2019s hand away. His careful control shattered to splinters, gone beyond repair. \u201cMy daughters may be dead. None of our brothers have been able to find any trace of them. I need to go back. I need to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The yellows and golds in Lucien\u2019s eyes stirred, swirling and twisting around his pupils. Compassion stilled his features and he placed his hand on Eron\u2019s chest. \u201cThis path has become harder than any of us would have imagined, but we must continue on course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only want to see my girls. I will not interfere with our plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it is not that simple. You\u2019re still weak from your last trip\u2014from ridding Nika of the sgath poison. You won\u2019t be able to shield your passage, and Father will feel you cross over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m strong enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. You are not. Not yet. Father will kill you, and then what will happen to your daughters?\u201d</p><p>Eron bowed his head over Lucien\u2019s hand. He was right. They had so little time on Earth that none of the others could spare much to take care of his children.</p><p>They had their own to care for.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d said Eron. \u201cThe cost is too great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it is to all of us, but reports show our predictions were right. The Synestryn are growing more powerful, and there are not enough Sentinels left to hold the gate. We must persevere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re going back.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. Eron knew Lucien was more dedicated than all of them, no matter the personal cost. But then, he had more to lose here than any of them, should their plans fail.</p><p>\u201cI am. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Eron shook his head. \u201cHow can you continue to go back after knowing what my daughters have suffered?\u201d</p><p>Lucien looked out at the moons, then down into the countryside, dotted with lights from the homes sprawled across it. \u201cI go because it is the only way to save what we have here. The only way to protect my home. My family.\u201d He looked back to Eron and his eyes were swirling with the golden fire of determination. \u201cWe must not fail.\u201d</p><p>Eron sighed in resignation. Their path had seemed so glorious at first. So righteous.</p><p>But now . . . Eron pulled his most prized possession from the pouch hanging over his heart. The photograph of his woman and their three daughters was worn and faded, but he hardly needed it to remember the lines of his beloved Celine\u2019s face or the sweet curve of his babies\u2019 cheeks. The image was burned into his memory, where their happy faces and the knowledge that he\u2019d failed them would live for eternity.</p> <p>With a trembling hand, he handed the page to Lucien. \u201cWill you seek them out for me? Find out if my baby girl escaped capture?\u201d</p><p>Lucien looked at the image and gave a solemn nod. \u201cI will try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many hours will you have there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine. No more.\u201d</p><p>Eron prayed it would be enough. \u201cThe summer always robs us of our time with them.\u201d</p><p>Lucien shrugged. \u201cIt is how it must be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I suppose I shouldn\u2019t resent it so much anymore. Celine is gone and my time with her is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the humans are right, and their heaven does exist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is a beautiful notion\u2014to be reunited with those we love to live in peace forever. Celine believed in it.\u201d If anyone was deserving of such a fate, it was Eron\u2019s beloved.</p><p>The sharp click of heels rushed down the hallway and Aurora slid around the corner. Her long, pale hair was mussed from her run, and a bright pink flush stained her cheeks. Her sunset-colored eyes were wide with fear, her soft lips parted to ease her labored breathing. Of all the women in their world, she was the most beautiful, and even Eron, whose heart belonged to another, had to pause for a moment whenever she entered the room. She was a servant, but as the most treasured possession of the Solarc, she knew more freedom than most.</p><p>She was also their most powerful ally.</p><p>\u201cThe Solarc comes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Lucien stowed the photograph away in his jacket. \u201cI must leave now. The gate will be aligned to open in a few more moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, then. I will stay here and distract Father. If you find my girls, give them my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear it.\u201d Lucien\u2019s eyes flared in the darkness, their swirling colors rioting in response to his vow. He cupped Aurora\u2019s cheek and spoke in hushed, urgent tones. \u201cThe Solarc cannot know where I\u2019ve gone, or our lives as well as those of our children on Earth would be forfeit. I won\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head. \u201cYes, Highness. I understand.\u201d</p><p>Lucien left through a hidden doorway, and Eron turned to Aurora and held out his hand. \u201cCome to me. We\u2019ll distract Father and cover the signs of your sprint here all at once.\u201d</p><p>Aurora went into his arms without hesitation. When Eron kissed her, she pretended to enjoy it as a good servant would, letting out a soft moan. Eron felt nothing. As beautiful as she was, she was not Celine. She didn\u2019t smell like his Celine or taste like her. But he faked his response to their embrace all the same, knowing it would distract his father as nothing else could.</p><p>The lives of Eron\u2019s children, if they still lived, depended upon it. If the Solarc knew his sons had broken his law, he would slaughter them all without regard to the fact that those children were his grandchildren as well.</p><p>Eron knew. He\u2019d seen it happen before.</p><p>Paul was so sweet he made Andra cry, damn it. She wiped the tears away and pulled her rumpled jeans back up over her hips. She didn\u2019t have time to cry. She had a sister to save.</p><p>Power pulsed inside her, making her skin feel as though it were glowing. The intimacy she\u2019d shared with Paul had worked the way he said, and now she wanted to see whether she had the ability to help Nika. Or if maybe she needed another go-around in the grass with Paul.</p><p>They were both appealing options.</p><p>Her body sang, satisfied and replete. Normally, she would have felt like sleeping for half a day, but this was not normal. Not even close. For a moment there at the end, she thought she might have actually been able to see through his eyes, feel through his skin.</p><p>Surely that was just an illusion\u2014a side effect of magical sex or something.</p><p>\u201cDo you think our connection is strong enough now?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Paul lounged naked in the grass, watching her dress with drowsy eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but if not, you can\u2019t rush this kind of thing. It\u2019s not safe for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can get her to eat, that will be enough. I just have to keep her alive long enough to get stronger.\u201d Long enough for Andra to get stronger, too. The process was definitely going to be a fun one.</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d asked Paul. There was an odd note in his voice\u2014a hint of challenge, maybe? She wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming you can heal Nika, what then?\u201d</p><p>Andra pulled her shirt down over her bra. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far ahead. I guess she\u2019ll come live with me. Finish school. That kind of thing. She has a lot of living to catch up on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, what happens to us? Once you don\u2019t need me anymore?\u201d</p><p>She smoothed her short hair back in place to give herself a moment to think. Everything was coming at her too fast. She couldn\u2019t keep up. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Paul. I just met you last night. That\u2019s not much of an \u2018us\u2019 to think about. I like you, but Nika has to come first.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, but his jaw was tight with anger or frustration. She didn\u2019t know him well enough to tell the difference, which only served to prove her point.</p><p>And yet she\u2019d slept with him and enjoyed every moment of it. Enjoyed it so much she was already wondering if she\u2019d get a chance to do it again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deny it. After what he\u2019d done for her, she owed him her honesty. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I know where I stand. That\u2019s more than I had last time.\u201d He stood and stalked off, still naked, pausing only long enough to grab his sword.</p><p>Last time. With Kate.</p><p>A pulse of anger filtered through their connection before she felt it close off.</p><p>Andra scrubbed her hands over her face. He was such a good man. He didn\u2019t deserve to be used like this, but she had no choice. She\u2019d been honest with him from the beginning. Nika came first. It was the only way Andra could live with herself.</p><p>Paul resisted the urge to slam the back door of the Gerai house as he entered the kitchen.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been so hurt that Andra was using him. Hell, he was using her, too, in a way. It was a symbiotic relationship. She needed him to help Nika, and he needed her to survive. It was a fair trade\u2014one he was actually benefiting from more than she was.</p><p>But if that was the case, then why did it piss him off so much?</p><p>Madoc was in the kitchen, with a stack of sandwiches in front of him. He didn\u2019t bother swallowing before saying, \u201cWhat the fuck crawled up your ass?\u201d</p><p>Paul really wished he\u2019d remembered to grab his clothes before coming back inside. There was nothing quite as uncomfortable as talking about his ass with another man while standing in the nude. So he ignored the question. \u201cHow\u2019s Nika?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Mind keeping an eye on Andra for me while I get dressed? I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be in in a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>That was as close to a yes as Paul figured he\u2019d get out of Madoc. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only spare clothes are in Nika\u2019s room, but if you wake her up, I\u2019ll cut off your balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks for the warning, man,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>Madoc grunted in response and went back to his sandwich.</p><p>When Paul eased the door of the bedroom open, Nika didn\u2019t even shift. In fact, she was so still, he stared to detect the faint shift of the covers over her chest as she breathed. When the blanket moved, he let out a relieved breath. Thank God she was still hanging on. If she\u2019d died while Andra and he were outside making love, she never would have forgiven herself, even if there had been nothing she could have done to prevent it.</p><p>Paul slipped silently into the walk-in closet and searched through the neatly labeled clothes for his size. Everything was new and stiff, but the outfit was clean, it fit, and it covered him up.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you could have come back out and gotten your clothes,\u201d said Andra from the closet doorway. He hadn\u2019t heard her come into the bedroom, which made him question where his head was. Maybe she was just really quiet.</p><p>Her cheeks were flushed with color and her hair still had bits of grass in it. Her lips were red and puffy from where he\u2019d kissed her a little too hard, and the luceria around her throat had deepened to a swirl of rich, sapphire blues. The Sapphire Lady. He liked it.</p><p>Hell, he loved it. Just thinking about keeping her made his dick swell in anticipation. No way could they be together long without a repeat performance of what happened outside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t normally storm off naked,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind. I enjoyed watching the show. You have a great ass.\u201d</p><p>A grin tickled his mouth and he gave in to it. He loved how she could do that to him\u2014how she could make him smile when there didn\u2019t seem to be any reason to do so. \u201cYours is pretty nice, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, this mad thing you\u2019ve got going here. Wanna talk about it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How could he explain what he was feeling to her without looking like a needy bastard? He sure as hell didn\u2019t want to tell her that he\u2019d die without her. No one should have to live with pressure like that. He didn\u2019t want to be a burden. If she was going to stay with him, he wanted it to be for a real reason. Not guilt. \u201cMaybe later. I think we should see what we can do for Nika, first.\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded. \u201cOkay. Rain check, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He saw her shift gears from him to Nika. That familiar look of guilty concern he\u2019d come to recognize filled her eyes, and she glanced back over her shoulder to where Nika lay. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d she asked him.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I knew for sure. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with her, so we\u2019ll have to play it by ear. Go slow and easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a chance I could hurt her?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t lie to her. \u201cYes. But at this point, what are your options? What are hers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said there were people at your home who might be able to help her, right?\u201d Her voice shook with insecurity.</p><p>Paul ignored his own problems. He\u2019d worry about those later. Right now, Andra needed him.</p> <p>He took her hand and a subtle rush of warmth flowed between their fingers. It would be so easy to focus on the physical and ignore the problems around them, but that wasn\u2019t going to solve anything.</p><p>\u201cThe Sanguinar\u2014the men like Logan\u2014are our healers. They might be able to help if we can get her to the point where she can give them her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll go for that, but we can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can make it painless for her. Take her blood while she sleeps and make sure she never knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little creepy, don\u2019t you think? How do you know it\u2019s never happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Paul had lived with it for so long, it didn\u2019t bother him anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t. I just choose not to worry about it. As long as we\u2019re there, she\u2019d be safe. I\u2019d never allow anyone to hurt her any more than you would. But that\u2019s not our only option. Even if the Sanguinar can\u2019t help her, Sibyl may know what can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Sibyl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a seer. She knows things that no one else does. She might be able to see what we need to do to heal Nika. There are magical artifacts roaming around the world that can do amazing things. She may know of one that could help and tell us where to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s hope,\u201d said Andra, grasping his hand tight.</p><p>Paul slid his finger along her cheek, reveling in the smoothness of her skin. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there are all of these people who can help, maybe I shouldn\u2019t mess with her. I could make things worse. We should just take her to your home, where people know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave some faith in yourself. You know Nika. You love her. You\u2019re not going to do anything to hurt her. Besides, Logan said she was too weak to travel.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to tell her that he\u2019d feared she was already dead when he walked into the room. There was no guarantee she\u2019d even live through the night.</p><p>Andra looked into his eyes, silently pleading with him to help. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, Paul. I don\u2019t know how to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 16</p><p>Nika didn\u2019t even move when Andra slid into bed next to her. Her skinny frame dipped with the mattress under Andra\u2019s weight, but she didn\u2019t so much as bat an eyelash. Andra pressed her hand to Nika\u2019s head. She was cool to the touch. The pulse fluttering in her neck was faint and unsteady.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it like we did before, remember?\u201d asked Paul. \u201cJust open yourself up and let me guide you. We\u2019re just going to go look around first.\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded. Paul\u2019s hand slid around to the nape of her neck, his ring locking with her necklace. She felt the band around her throat warm. Her breathing sped up, and a fizzing kind of pressure built inside her. Her head started to throb and her stomach gave a queasy twist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fighting it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to.\u201d She tried to relax, but her jaw clenched against the pain and nausea. She wasn\u2019t going to be able to do this. It was going to be like losing Tori all over again. She was going to just stand there and watch while her sister slipped away and\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d growled Paul. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. Focus.\u201d</p><p>Andra pulled in a deep breath and tried to do as he said. The pressure built until sweat broke out over her skin and she was shaking with the force of it.</p><p>Still nothing happened.</p><p>Andra opened her eyes and looked at Nika\u2019s small body. She was so weak. Helpless. Her mind was a writhing mass of madness and images too horrible to be real. That night had destroyed her. Maybe it was the trauma, or maybe it was some kind of infection from the monster\u2019s yellow saliva. It had licked her wound, lapping up the blood. Something could have gotten into her body and infected her with this illness. Maybe she needed a magical antibiotic.</p><p>The pressure inside Andra released suddenly, as if a bubble had popped. She let out the breath she\u2019d been holding, and when she looked up, she was no longer in the bedroom with Nika. She was somewhere dark.</p><p>She could hear the steady drip of water echoing off hard walls, smell the musty dampness in the air. It was cold here\u2014the kind of cold that seeped into your blood and stole away your will to move.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Nika. She appeared near a rock wall, her image shimmering and translucent, like some kind of hologram. She was younger, maybe sixteen, and her hair was dark and wavy, like it had been before the night Mom and Tori died. She wore a black dress, and although she was thin, she wasn\u2019t skinny.</p><p>\u201cWhere is here?\u201d asked Andra, looking around. It was a cave of some kind, but not those pretty ones with the glistening formations. This was an oppressive black hole deep in the ground.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d whispered Nika. \u201cThey\u2019ll hear you. You have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I need to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do for me. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Nika. Let me help.\u201d</p><p>Nika frowned in confusion and her head tilted to one side. \u201cYou see me and yet you still don\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what?\u201d</p><p>Nika turned suddenly and her eyes grew wide. \u201cThey\u2019re coming. You have to go. Don\u2019t try to come back. They\u2019ll find you and kill you both.\u201d</p><p>Before Andra could ask who was coming or what she meant by both, she was thrust out of Nika\u2019s mind and back to the bedroom.</p><p>Nika thrashed on the bed and her eyes were wild and fearful. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for her.\u201d</p><p>Andra swallowed a cry of anguish and held Nika down. \u201cWhat are you talking about, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTori. They\u2019re coming for her. They\u2019re going to hurt her again.\u201d She grabbed onto Andra\u2019s shirt with a surprisingly strong grip. \u201cYou have to go find her. Save her.\u201d</p><p>The bedroom door slammed open hard enough to leave a dent in the wall. Madoc charged in, sword drawn. His mouth was twisted into a snarl of rage, and the veins in his neck and arms stood out in stark relief. \u201cWhat the fuck did you do to her?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Paul stood and put his body between Madoc and the women. \u201cWe were trying to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome help. She was sleeping a minute ago. I told you what I\u2019d do if you woke her up.\u201d</p><p>The high chime of metal sliding on metal made the hairs on the back of Andra\u2019s neck stand up. \u201cYou could try,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Nika, struggling to sit up.</p><p>Andra wasn\u2019t about to let these men kill each other because of a simple case of testosterone poisoning. She wasn\u2019t sure what she was doing, but she figured anything was better than doing nothing, so she pulled on Paul\u2019s power and used it to shove both men back with a hard wall of air.</p><p>The men hit the bedroom walls with a jolt and stayed there like they were glued.</p><p>Wow. She hadn\u2019t expected it to work quite so well.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she ordered them. \u201cYou two are going to calm down and act like rational human beings. I don\u2019t care if you are men.\u201d</p><p>Nika\u2019s voice quavered from the bed. \u201cYou should let them go, Andra. I don\u2019t think this is smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how smart it is. They\u2019re not going anywhere until I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to kill each other.\u201d</p><p>The rush of energy coursing through her made her limbs shake, but she held the pressure against the two men until she was sure it was safe. Paul calmed down first, his face draining of rage.</p><p>Nika slid from the bed and walked over to where Madoc was pinned and snarling. She seemed to be steadier on her feet now. Stronger.</p><p>Maybe what they\u2019d done had helped her somehow, though Andra had no idea what she\u2019d done to help.</p><p>Paul rubbed his shoulder like it hurt, but pride shone in his face. \u201cThat was one hell of a stunt. I didn\u2019t know you could do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>Nika put her hand on Madoc\u2019s chest, and his body went still, as if he were afraid he\u2019d hurt her if he breathed. \u201cGet back to bed,\u201d he snapped at her.</p><p>\u201cNot until you calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll paddle your ass if you don\u2019t go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d said Nika with total confidence. \u201cYou\u2019d never lay a hand on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t push him,\u201d warned Paul.</p><p>Madoc\u2019s green eyes lit up with a promise of violence. \u201cListen to the grown-ups, honey, or you\u2019ll end up regretting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a grown-up,\u201d said Nika.</p><p>Madoc snorted.</p><p>This was not going to end well. Andra went to her sister before she poked the stick at the caged beast one too many times. She took Nika by the shoulders and led her back to bed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. You shouldn\u2019t be up and around yet. You\u2019re still weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling better since I ate,\u201d said Nika.</p><p>\u201cYou ate?\u201d asked Andra. The band of fear around her chest loosened a little, giving her room to breathe. \u201cThat\u2019s great news, baby.\u201d</p><p>Nika looked to where Madoc was pinned. \u201cHe helped.\u201d</p><p>Both Paul and Andra stared at Madoc in shock. He\u2019d been right. He did get her to eat. Who knew?</p><p>In thanks, Andra let the force holding him to the wall dissipate. He didn\u2019t try to lunge for her or attack, but he sure looked like he was aching to. His big fists clenched and released over and over, making the bones pop as they shifted. \u201cI\u2019m going outside now. Don\u2019t any of you follow me.\u201d He pointed a thick finger at Nika. \u201cEspecially you.\u201d</p><p>He left the room, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Nika slumped back against the pillows. She was pale, but the wildness in her eyes had faded. For now.</p><p>Andra would take the gift without question and treasure the time she had with her sister for as long as it lasted. \u201cDo you think you could eat some more?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nika shook her head. Her eyelids drooped. \u201cNot now. Gotta sleep more. Maybe later.\u201d</p><p>Andra smoothed her white hair back and felt her body go limp as she slipped almost instantly into sleep.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what we did, but it seems to have helped,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>Paul was still watching the way Madoc had gone, his gaze speculative. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we did anything,\u201d he told her. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d love to tell you otherwise, but I\u2019d be lying.\u201d</p> <p>Another failure, but it didn\u2019t sting nearly as badly as it would have otherwise. She didn\u2019t care how Nika got help, just so long as she did. \u201cShe seemed lucid just now.\u201d</p><p>Paul was still watching the doorway, frowning. \u201cShe sure did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she ate. That\u2019s more than I\u2019d hoped for. Do you think it\u2019s safe to move her yet?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how she\u2019s feeling when she wakes up, but I think it would be safer to move her to Dabyr than to stay here another night. Besides, Sibyl is waiting. She wanted you to be there tonight, so we\u2019re already late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we travel during the day, the monsters can\u2019t find us, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave in the morning, then.\u201d She leaned down and kissed Nika\u2019s head. \u201cDid you hear that, baby? You\u2019re going to be okay. We\u2019re going to get you help.\u201d</p><p>The sun was sinking near the horizon by the time Paul pulled Andra\u2019s truck up to the gate of the Sentinel compound he called home. Dabyr. The warriors\u2019 stronghold.</p><p>Andra and Nika had slept most of the way here, and he hated having to wake them now. Andra looked so pretty in sleep\u2014her cheeks rosy pink, her short hair tousled around her face, her full mouth parted as if waiting for a kiss.</p><p>He smiled for the camera, knowing Nicholas would be on duty, slid his ID card into the slot, and waited for the gates to open.</p><p>Paul parked her truck in his slot in the multicar garage. The compound was an odd combination that was part ski resort and part military base. The stone walls of the main building glowed pink in the waning light of day, and at this time, Dabyr would be bustling with activity. Over five hundred souls called this place home, and among them were Theronai, Sanguinar, and some of the Gerai\u2014the humans who served in their cause.</p> <p>Paul killed the truck\u2019s engine and stroked Andra\u2019s cheek to wake her. Her skin was so warm and soft to his battle-scarred hands, and the thrill of pleasure that ran through his arm only heightened the sensation. He still couldn\u2019t believe she was his\u2014at least for two more days.</p><p>Andra sighed and leaned her head back, offering Paul more of her smooth skin to caress. He knew better than to take advantage of the situation like this, but pride filled him up and he couldn\u2019t help but slide his finger over the luceria. In the hours it had taken them to get here, the colors had settled even more, their swirling increasingly lazy and slow.</p><p>The rap of knuckles against the glass jarred Paul out of his happy place, and he jerked his hand away as if he\u2019d been caught doing something naughty.</p><p>Morgan Valens stood outside the driver\u2019s door, giving Paul a knowing grin. White teeth stood out in stark contrast against Morgan\u2019s brown skin. His Egyptian heritage was evident in his bold mouth and canted brown eyes. Women adored Morgan. Paul had heard them whispering about his stamina and prowess in bed, and the last thing Paul wanted was for Morgan to be the first thing Andra saw when she woke up. He didn\u2019t need that kind of competition.</p><p>Paul rolled down the window. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked a little more gruffly than his friend deserved.</p><p>Nika stirred from her sleep, letting out a soft, whimpering sound.</p><p>Morgan leaned over so he could see the women better. \u201cJoseph is looking for you. You didn\u2019t report in yesterday and he\u2019s pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he can just be pissed. I was busy.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan eyed Andra\u2019s sleeping form, and Paul shifted his body to block his view. \u201cBusy. I see. Two women will definitely do that to a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need our help. Nika was too weak to travel yesterday or we would have been here sooner.\u201d As Sibyl had asked. He wasn\u2019t looking forward to facing her disappointment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell Joseph that before he puts your ass on perimeter duty during the rainy season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019ll make an exception this time.\u201d</p><p>Morgan shook his head in awe, his eyes sliding over the luceria gracing Andra\u2019s throat. \u201cAnother female Theronai. This place has already gone apeshit since Helen arrived. Once the men find out there\u2019s another . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will give them hope,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>\u201cIt will send the few who are left here scurrying to the four winds, searching for their own women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll stick around here while all the others go out searching?\u201d</p><p>A car door slammed, followed closely by a second. The sound echoed off the thick concrete walls of the giant garage. Madoc must have pulled in right behind them.</p><p>\u201cHell, no. Not unless one of them happens to show up before I\u2019m done packing.\u201d Morgan nodded his head toward Nika. \u201cShe okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to carry her inside? I\u2019ll be real gentle so she won\u2019t wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch her and die, Romeo,\u201d said Madoc from behind Morgan.</p><p>Logan was beside him, looking a little green.</p><p>\u201cYou caught up fast,\u201d said Paul. Madoc had waited for Logan to feed before they followed Paul and the women. They had to have left at least an hour after Paul had.</p><p>\u201cYou just drive like an old man,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d argued Logan. \u201cYou drive like a maniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have happily let you out anywhere you wanted, leech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the daylight? What a gentleman you are,\u201d said Logan.</p><p>Madoc flashed him a smile full of sharp teeth.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I love your company, I\u2019m going inside. I have work to do.\u201d Logan stalked off toward the entrance to the main hall.</p><p>Andra shifted beside Paul, rubbing up against his thigh. She woke slowly, body first, and Paul could do nothing but watch. She stretched her long legs, then her arms, then straightened as much as the cab of the truck would allow before bothering to open her eyes. The show she unknowingly put on with that lovely stretching made every man there stare. He shifted so she wasn\u2019t on display\u2014at least not to anyone but him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked on a yawn.</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d He didn\u2019t say whose. He was hoping too much that it would be hers as well as his very soon.</p><p>\u201cAlready? That was fast.\u201d She looked over at Nika and pressed her hand against her sister\u2019s forehead. Nika didn\u2019t stir. \u201cHas she been asleep the whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She was making a few noises, though.\u201d</p><p>Madoc went around the truck, the sound of his heavy boots loud on the concrete.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of noises?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cNothing horrible,\u201d said Paul as Madoc opened the passenger-side door. The whimpers had been heart-breaking, but he didn\u2019t feel the need to share that with Andra.</p><p>\u201cAndra, this is Morgan Valens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d said Andra through the open window.</p><p>Morgan smiled, dipped his head in a small formal bow, and offered her his hand. \u201cA pleasure, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She gave his hand a brief shake and Paul\u2019s eyes were fixed on Morgan\u2019s luceria, looking for even the slightest sign that they might be compatible. Nothing changed, and Paul let out a silent sigh of relief.</p><p>Morgan\u2019s smile faded as he realized the same thing. She couldn\u2019t save him.</p><p>\u201cWhen is her ceremony?\u201d asked Morgan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat ceremony?\u201d asked Andra, frowning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just this thing we do for women like you. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Madoc unbuckled Nika\u2019s seat belt and slid his arms under her body. \u201cWhere is she going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI can get her,\u201d said Andra, scrubbing her face with her hands as if trying to wake up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother.\u201d</p><p>Madoc snorted. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t weigh enough to be a bother. Which way?\u201d</p><p>Andra let out a sigh of resignation. \u201cWherever your medical facilities are, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur doctors make house calls,\u201d said Paul. \u201cWe do have an infirmary, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019d like it there. Too sterile and cold. She\u2019ll be more comfortable if you\u2019re close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will I be staying?\u201d</p><p>Paul lowered his voice. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d stay in my suite.\u201d Preferably naked, but he\u2019d take what he could get.</p><p>She blushed as if she\u2019d caught his stray thought, which made Paul let out a bark of laughter. Maybe she did have a streak of shyness in her somewhere after all.</p><p>Andra sniffed and pulled on an air of indifference. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Paul\u2019s suite. Do you know the way?\u201d</p><p>Madoc didn\u2019t answer, but he turned and carried Nika toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Joseph know you\u2019ve arrived,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBut I\u2019ll walk slowly so you have a chance to . . . settle in.\u201d He winked at Andra and hurried after Madoc, opening the door for him so he wouldn\u2019t have to jostle Nika.</p><p>Andra was still blushing, which Paul decided was a good look for her. Especially when her blush spread out over her bare breasts and belly, and he was the cause of it.</p><p>The door to the main building shut behind the men, leaving the two of them alone.</p><p>Paul took her hand and ran his fingertip across the silky skin. \u201cThere are going to be a lot of people here who will want to meet you. Especially our men. They\u2019ll all want to give you their vow. That\u2019s the ceremony Morgan was talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet whoever you want, and let them all beat their chests or cut themselves or whatever it takes to get Nika help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that\u2019s how you\u2019d feel. I just didn\u2019t want you to be taken by surprise. A lot has happened to you in a really short time.\u201d</p><p>She turned her hand over and laced her fingers through his. Her grip was tight, almost desperate. \u201cI\u2019m tough. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s my job. Besides, someone\u2019s got to.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, but not before he could see the sheen of tears brighten her eyes. \u201cWe should go. I don\u2019t like leaving Nika alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not alone. Madoc\u2019s with her,\u201d said Paul, then after his words and their connotation sank in: \u201cRight. We should go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Andra followed Paul through the underground tunnel that led from the garage to what he called the main hall. She wasn\u2019t sure hall was the right word for a room with a glass ceiling fifty feet overhead and enough space to fit a football field. Halls were dark and long and skinny, not huge and bright and filled with live plants in every corner.</p><p>The room was separated into sections. Half of it was set up with mismatched kitchen tables that seated anywhere from two to twelve. Every table was decorated with a vase of fresh flowers and a bright, cheery yellow tablecloth. The other half of the room was cut into two more areas\u2014one with a huge TV and plenty of overstuffed couches, and the other with a pool table and several video game systems hooked up to more big TVs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Several children lounged around, and a couple adults were sipping coffee, keeping watch over everything. When Andra came in, everyone stopped what they were doing and stared.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d she asked Paul.</p><p>\u201cWe call it Dabyr. It\u2019s home for about five hundred men, women, and children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean those kids live here? It\u2019s not just a vacation spot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome because their parents live here, though most of them are orphans under our care. Today was a school day, but now that the school day is over, they hang out and do kid stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s summer.\u201d</p><p>Paul smiled. \u201cWe like to keep them busy so they stay out of trouble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t look like they\u2019re causing any trouble to me,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s usually when they\u2019re at their worst. Especially the teens. They\u2019re always planning something\u2014fighting against the confines of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have loved to have a place like this to go when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now, but many of these kids have no choice about being here. They can stay here, or they can die when the Synestryn hunt them down for food. That kind of thing grates on the more rebellious teens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they make any other kind?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot since I\u2019ve been alive.\u201d</p> <p>They passed through the dining area and turned right, entering a long hallway. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we could check to be sure Nika is settled in my suite before we go see Joseph Rayd.\u201d</p><p>His wide shoulders stretched the gray knit of his shirt, letting her see the yummy bulge of muscles over his back. His dark blond hair was mussed, and from her side view she could tell he was in desperate need of a shave.</p><p>Or maybe not. The soft scratch of those whiskers over her skin would be a pleasurable sort of pain\u2014the kind a woman could definitely get used to. Paul knew what he was doing when it came to giving her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWho is Joseph Rayd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe unlucky bastard who was elected to lead us. He keeps us all in line\u2014as much as anyone could. He\u2019ll need to know about you and Nika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to agree to help her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will. Nika is one of ours now.\u201d</p> <p>Andra let out a slow breath of relief. She was sure that if anyone could help Nika, it would be these people.</p><p>Paul led her down another long hallway that reminded her of a hotel. Doors lined each side, though they were farther apart than in any hotel she\u2019d stayed in. At a door near the end of the hall, he slid a key card in the lock and opened the door for her to enter first.</p><p>Andra was shocked to find that though it looked like a hotel room from the outside, inside it looked like a normal home. The place was neat, with only a few pieces of art on the walls\u2014all seascapes. One wall was lined with shelves that groaned with the weight of hundreds of books. The couch and matching recliner were worn, but looked comfortable, and the flat-screen TV nearly took up one wall all by itself. A small kitchen was tucked into one corner, with a round table and two chairs crowding the space.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d said Madoc in a low voice. He quietly shut the door he\u2019d just come out of so the latch didn\u2019t even click. In his hand was an empty water glass.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in my rooms?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>\u201cMorgan had Nicholas pop the lock remotely.\u201d Madoc went to Paul\u2019s kitchen and ducked his head to peer into the refrigerator.</p><p>Andra nodded to the glass. \u201cDid you get her to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s sleeping again, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Where did Morgan go?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>Madoc pulled out a beer, opened it, and took a long pull from the bottle. \u201cI\u2019m sure he went to tell everyone we\u2019ve found two more women. This place is going to be crawling with men within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go see Joseph,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m staying here with Nika.\u201d Madoc pulled a chair out from the small kitchen table and crammed his body into the tight space. He leaned back and got comfortable, as if he weren\u2019t planning to leave anytime soon.</p><p>Paul gave a grudging nod. \u201cFine. Stay.\u201d He turned to Andra. \u201cYou should stay here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should talk to this leader guy with you. Just in case he needs any convincing to help Nika.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but if I go along, then I can make sure it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p><p>Andra dropped her overnight bag and followed Paul to the door. He opened and held it for her to exit. When she hit the hotel-style hall, she was jarred again by the fact that this wasn\u2019t some suburban home. And then she was jarred even more when she collided with the chest of a man coming down the hall.</p><p>Andra bounced off the man and Paul steadied her before she could fall on her ass and humiliate herself further. Paul\u2019s hands were surprisingly strong, even for a guy as big as he was, and though she was steady on her feet, he didn\u2019t let go. He kept a loose grip on her waist and elbow, and his touch caused a surge of heat to lance through her stomach. She knew she should pull away, but it felt too good to be touched by such strong, capable hands. She\u2019d seen what the man could do with a sword\u2014the brutal lethality he was capable of\u2014but right now, all she felt was gentleness and warmth and tingly spirals rioting around in her belly.</p><p>\u201cJoseph,\u201d said Paul in greeting. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet Andra Madison.\u201d</p><p>Joseph was taller than Paul, nearly six and a half feet. He had broad shoulders, but they were bent, like he bore the weight of an invisible burden. Deep worry lines etched his handsome face, and his hazel eyes were sunken and rimmed with red from lack of sleep. His short dark hair was graying at the temples, and his clothes looked like they had been slept in. Twice.</p><p>Andra automatically held out her hand in greeting and she felt Paul tense beside her. Joseph shook her hand with a firm grip. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to meet you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>My lady? Andra looked behind her just to make sure he wasn\u2019t talking to someone else. \u201cUh. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a formal term. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>When Joseph let go of her hand, Paul relaxed, though she could see his intense gaze scrutinizing Joseph as if looking for something.</p><p>Andra ignored Paul\u2019s oddness. Maybe these two weren\u2019t on the best of terms. She really didn\u2019t care as long as he agreed to help Nika. \u201cDo you know why we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>Joseph nodded, but he was frowning at the ring on his left hand\u2014the one that all these men seemed to wear. \u201cI\u2019ve heard your sister is ill. Morgan said she\u2019s dangerously thin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s . . . troubled.\u201d Andra\u2019s cheeks flamed with embarrassment, not because her sister was sick, but because Andra had let it happen. It was her failure that had nearly killed Nika.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her mind that is most at risk, Joseph,\u201d said Paul. \u201cShe\u2019s lived with this for eight years.\u201d</p><p>Joseph\u2019s mouth opened in shock. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right. Eight years? And she still lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s strong,\u201d said Andra. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like it now, but she\u2019s a fighter. She tries so hard to overcome the images in her head. She\u2019s been in therapy for years, but nothing seems to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Human therapy would do nothing to aid her. I\u2019m calling in Tynan.\u201d Joseph pulled a cell phone out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cLogan said she\u2019s too weak to give him her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll find another way. We won\u2019t let her die. She\u2019s too valuable.\u201d</p><p>Andra wasn\u2019t sure what he meant by that, but if he thought she was valuable, and that made him act faster, then it worked for her.</p><p>\u201cThe men will all want to see her, touch her,\u201d said Paul. \u201cI think that would only make things worse.\u201d</p><p>Andra grabbed Paul\u2019s arm. \u201cI am not going to let a bunch of men parade through her room pawing at her.\u201d</p><p>Paul cupped Andra\u2019s cheek. \u201cOf course not. But you have to understand how much these men are suffering. If she is compatible with one or more of them, the way you are with me, it might be another way to help her.\u201d</p><p>Andra was torn. She wanted to do whatever she could for Nika, but she\u2019d seen what these people were like. They were aggressive, demanding. Scary. At least, they would be to Nika. \u201cYou saw the way she reacted to Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems to be fine with Madoc,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>Joseph\u2019s dark brows rose. \u201cYou don\u2019t think . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I checked. His luceria didn\u2019t react to her. In fact, the colors are faded.\u201d He said that last part like it held some kind of special meaning.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we need to keep an eye on him?\u201d asked Joseph.</p><p>\u201cYes. I know he\u2019d never hurt her as long as his lifemark holds out, but once it\u2019s barren . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Nicholas keep an electronic eye on him. His security cameras pick up everything.\u201d</p><p>Andra looked between the men, trying to figure out what they were talking about. \u201cAre you guys saying that Nika might be at risk with Madoc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine right now. He\u2019s just . . . running out of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying?\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s mouth opened and shut again as if he were deciding what to say. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s not contagious. We just need to be watchful for signs that he\u2019s changing. Getting . . . darker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man is already about as angry as they come. I\u2019m going back inside with my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk, Paul,\u201d said Joseph.</p><p>Paul gave Andra the key card. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to need your help with this.\u201d</p><p>Andra went back into the suite and found Madoc standing in Nika\u2019s doorway. He filled up the space, so that she could hardly see her sister sleeping peacefully on the bed. But she was, and something inside Andra loosened and relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d demanded Andra in a whisper.</p><p>Madoc spun around like he hadn\u2019t heard her come close. He scowled and pulled the door shut before pushing past her, ignoring her question.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ignore me. I asked you what you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just checking on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul says you\u2019re dying, and it sounded like before you did you were going to turn into something nasty. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d He flopped down on the couch and powered on the TV.</p><p>Andra snatched the remote away and turned it off. The threatening look that crossed his face gave her pause, but she didn\u2019t back down. \u201cI want you to stay away from her. Far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what the hell do you think I\u2019m going to do, lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t know anything about you guys or what you do or what you\u2019re capable of. What I do know is that if Paul is worried, then it must be bad, because he knows how to handle himself. Nika doesn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking nuts if you think I\u2019m going to do anything just because you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her sister. She\u2019s my responsibility. I may not be able to take you in a fair fight, but if you don\u2019t stay away, I\u2019ll find you and kill you in your sleep. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Madoc rose slowly from the couch, his powerful legs bunching with muscles. A truly frightening light glowed inside his feral green eyes. As angry as he was on the outside, inside was worse. Much, much worse. There was something dark in there. Something dangerous lurking behind the facade he showed the world.</p><p>His voice dipped to a low, quiet threat. \u201cFeel free to come by and take your best shot. Room two-nineteen. I\u2019ll leave my door unlocked. But since you want us to be clear, if you do come by, you\u2019ll be on my turf. My rules. I won\u2019t play fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that if I want to see Nika, there\u2019s not a fucking thing you can do to stop me. And if you try, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too good for you.\u201d</p><p>Madoc flinched, but covered it quickly. \u201cShe\u2019s too good for you, too, apparently. You were there the night this happened to her, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. You.\u201d</p> <p>Madoc gave her a sneering smile. \u201cAnytime you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from her. She\u2019s too innocent to protect herself from the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m able to keep her safe. Protect her. You can\u2019t even get her to eat.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. He was right. Andra felt like she\u2019d been punched, but she tried not to let it show. \u201cI got her here, didn\u2019t I? Paul will make sure she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Madoc snorted. \u201cPaul is only helping her to get in your pants. Keep you collared. If you think it\u2019s anything else, you\u2019re full of shit.\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s hand went to the luceria around her throat. It was vibrating now, warming under her touch. A second later, the door to Paul\u2019s suite slammed open and Paul and Joseph came in armed with swords in hand.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d demanded Paul.</p><p>Madoc took a step back. \u201cI was just leaving. Seems I\u2019m no longer wanted here.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s color was high, and he looked as if he were ready to strike Madoc down. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Andra had to swallow to find her voice. \u201cNo. I\u2019m fine. I just don\u2019t want him around Nika anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you the first time,\u201d growled Madoc. He pushed his way past the two armed men and left the suite.</p><p>Paul came to Andra and pulled her into a hug. \u201cAre you sure he didn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just pissed me off.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple and tightened his hold. \u201cHe\u2019s good at that.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to go check into that thing you asked me about, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll catch up later.\u201d Joseph left and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Paul tilted her face up to look at him. \u201cI could feel your pain as clear as if it had been my own. What did he say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I haven\u2019t said to myself a thousand times. Forget about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen. It kills me to see you suffer.\u201d His tone was so gentle, so loving, it was going to make her cry.</p><p>She pushed away from him before it could. \u201cJust let it go. I want to know what we\u2019re going to do for Nika.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s jaw tightened in frustration, and he pulled in a deep breath. \u201cTynan is on his way and Joseph is going to request an audience with Sibyl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s all good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s all good. We\u2019re going to take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc says you\u2019re only helping Nika to get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadoc is an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not right,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>Paul sat down on the couch and pulled her down next to him. \u201cIf I\u2019d never met you, I\u2019d still be doing everything I could to save Nika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s valuable to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s what I do. That\u2019s what we all do. Every one of us has taken a vow to protect humans from the Synestryn. So even if she weren\u2019t one of our own, I\u2019d still be right here, fighting for her. It\u2019s the reason I exist.\u201d</p><p>Andra felt the truth of his words ringing through their bond. She felt his conviction, his honesty, wrap around her and hold her tight. It felt so good not to be alone anymore. Even if it were for only a few days.</p><p>Her eyes burned, and she couldn\u2019t blink fast enough to make the tears dissipate. One slid down her cheek, and she turned around so Paul couldn\u2019t see her weakness.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he told her. \u201cDon\u2019t pull away from me. You don\u2019t have to be strong and in control all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I have to keep it together. Please try to understand that.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, and she could feel some of his frustration pulsing through their link. She didn\u2019t enjoy frustrating him, but she knew if she cracked now, she\u2019d break wide-open and destroy herself. She had to stay strong.</p><p>\u201cHow about I get us some dinner? Give you a few minutes alone?\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded. \u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny requests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise me.\u201d</p><p>When the door to Torr\u2019s suite opened, he knew it would be her. Grace Norman. The last person on the face of this planet he wanted to have see him like this, as helpless as a babe.</p><p>If his body hadn\u2019t been a worthless pile of meat, he would have simply met her at the door and gently shooed her away. She was a timid creature, and it wouldn\u2019t have taken much to send her scurrying.</p><p>At least, she was timid with everyone else. Not with him. He was paralyzed from the neck down, unable to hurt a fly. No one feared him anymore. He couldn\u2019t even hold his sword, much less swing it.</p><p>Grace gave him a cheerful smile as she entered the room carrying a plastic box full of her torture devices. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She slid over the floor on silent feet. Her name fit her, but Torr was sure that her naturally swift, graceful movements were not the product of long hours of dance class. From what he\u2019d learned about her, she\u2019d learned to dodge fists and flying bottles at a young age.</p><p>Never again. Her stepfather was rotting in a hole in the ground, and she was safe here.</p><p>He wished telling himself that would ease the knot of tension he felt between his eyes every time he saw her, but it didn\u2019t. Somehow bringing her here wasn\u2019t enough. He wanted to do more.</p><p>Then again, that was the story of his life these days. He couldn\u2019t even feed himself, much less protect Grace from imaginary threats.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. Go away,\u201d he growled at her.</p><p>She made a clicking sound with her tongue. \u201cNot nice, Torr. I\u2019m here to help you, whether or not you want it.\u201d</p><p>She was such a pretty thing, especially when she smiled. The smile never touched her sad brown eyes, but he\u2019d gotten used to that over the past few weeks. She came to see him every day, and nothing he\u2019d said or done had scared her off.</p><p>\u201cSend someone else,\u201d he said.</p><p>The halo of curly black hair around her head made her look younger than her twenty-two years. He should have been able to see her as a child, given that he was pushing four hundred, but with her, it just didn\u2019t happen. She was a woman\u2014one he found sexy as hell\u2014and that was part of the problem. There were so many things in his life that he wanted now and couldn\u2019t have. He didn\u2019t appreciate her adding to the pile.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I know what I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>Of course she did. She knew just how hopeless he was. She knew he\u2019d be paralyzed for the rest of his too-long life, and she pitied him. That was why she was here. She was too kind not to act on that pity.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She kept smiling and set the box down on the table next to his wheelchair. \u201cDon\u2019t be a baby. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I can\u2019t feel a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Cranky Pants. Be that way. I\u2019m still not leaving. I\u2019ve got an hour before my shift starts.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing he could do to stop her. He was weak. Helpless.</p><p>If he\u2019d had any strength left whatsoever, he would have used it to end his miserable life as soon as he realized the Sanguinar were unable to heal him\u2014before they wasted any more precious blood on trying to cure him.</p><p>Grace wheeled him to his bed, which was the focal point of his living room. All the equipment it took to keep his sorry ass clean and fed was too big for his bedroom, so now he lived here. All day. Every day.</p><p>He craved freedom so badly he was sure it would tear his mind apart. So far, he hadn\u2019t been that lucky.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard the news?\u201d she asked as she adjusted his chair until he was lying flat. She attached some straps and cranked the lever that eased him back onto his bed.</p><p>This blasted device made it easy for someone as small as Grace to move him around, but it also meant that she didn\u2019t need any help. It meant he had to be alone with her.</p><p>The longer he was alone with her, the more of himself he lost. His pride had been the first thing to go. In its place was a burning ball of shame and humiliation he could not escape.</p><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d he asked, unable to stave off his curiosity about the world outside.</p><p>Grace slid her hands inside the waistband of his sweats and peeled them off his legs, leaving him in a pair of boxers. She stared for a bit too long, making him wonder just how ugly his body had become as his flesh wasted away with disuse.</p><p>She swallowed visibly before answering. \u201cThey found two more women like Helen. They\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Torr refused to think about what that meant\u2014or at least he tried to. More women so soon after Helen? It didn\u2019t seem possible, and yet it was happening. Maybe she wasn\u2019t some genetic anomaly after all. Maybe his brothers could be saved.</p><p>The news did him no good, but he was still glad the rest of the Theronai had hope.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go see them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d never even consider seeing if either one of them was compatible with him as long as his body was useless. And no matter what lies the Sanguinar fed him, Torr was pretty sure they had no idea how to fix his paralysis.</p><p>Grace eased the head of the bed up and wrestled with his T-shirt. His muscle mass had started to shrivel away, but with his bulk, he still had to be quite a load for her to maneuver. She wasn\u2019t very big, maybe a few inches over five feet, but she\u2019d never once complained that he was too heavy. Maybe she was stronger than she looked on the outside, too.</p><p>Unlike many of his brothers, he still had a healthy number of leaves remaining on his lifemark. He\u2019d always felt blessed not to be suffering like so many others, but that blessing had become a curse. He had years left before his tree was barren, which would force Joseph to end Torr\u2019s life.</p><p>She managed to get the shirt over his head, and he got a nice view of her breasts\u2014soft, full breasts she kept hidden behind baggy clothing. He knew they were soft because she\u2019d accidentally brushed his cheek once while she\u2019d undressed him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He still had dreams about that innocent accident, only in his dreams, she\u2019d been naked and he\u2019d been a whole man. He always woke before they got to the really good part, but he enjoyed the fantasy for as long as it lasted.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. I can\u2019t even give them my vow. What possible good would it do for me to see them?\u201d</p><p>She combed her fingers through his hair to straighten it. Torr gritted his teeth against the feel of her fingers on his skin. She\u2019d spent hours touching him\u2014massaging his muscles and exercising his limbs so he\u2019d stay flexible\u2014but he never got to feel any of that. He just got to watch her hands slide over his legs, leaving a shiny path of massage oil in their wake.</p> <p>For all the good it did him, she might as well have been rubbing some other man\u2019s body.</p><p>That thought filled his head with the need for violence. He wanted to lash out and crush everything in his path. Not that what he wanted mattered anymore.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she replied. \u201cI just thought that if one of them were compatible with you, maybe she could help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeal me, you mean?\u201d he asked in a bitter, angry tone.</p><p>\u201cYes. The thought had crossed my mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way it works. Why don\u2019t you leave the doctoring to the leeches and stick to your duties in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Grace flinched as if he\u2019d hit her, and until he saw it, he didn\u2019t think he could feel any worse.</p><p>He\u2019d been wrong. He felt like total shit for hurting her feelings like that. She was only trying to help.</p><p>Everyone was only trying to help. It wasn\u2019t her fault he was sick of needing it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered to her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but didn\u2019t look him in the eye.</p> <p>She poured some oil into her palm and rubbed her hands together to warm it. He couldn\u2019t feel the cold, but she still took the time to see to his comfort.</p><p>She was way too kind to be anywhere near him. He was toxic\u2014as poisonous as the giant fanged slug that had latched itself onto his spine and taken away his life. If she stuck around, he would only end up hurting her more.</p><p>\u201cI really wish you\u2019d just leave me alone,\u201d he told her, trying to keep his voice calm.</p><p>Her slippery hands slid up his leg toward his crotch. He saw it, but felt nothing. His mind was thrilled by her touch, silently urging her to move up and take his dick into her slick hands, even as he knew what a useless waste of time it would be. He wouldn\u2019t feel that either. No matter how turned on his mind was, his body refused to respond.</p><p>He\u2019d never again know the pleasure of the flesh\u2014the intimate embrace of a woman\u2019s body, the hot slide of skin on skin.</p><p>\u201cI know you do, but I\u2019m not leaving. When the Sanguinar figure out how to fix you, you\u2019ll be grateful that your body hasn\u2019t curled in on itself. It will still take you some time to build your strength back, but at least your body will be able to move so you can rebuild it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Sanguinar have no idea how to fix me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re smart. They will figure it out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter the kind of life you\u2019ve had\u2014the beatings, watching your mother die a slow death\u2014how can you still have hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have hope because of the life I\u2019ve had. For fifteen years I prayed every night that someone would save me and my brother from the hell our lives had become. And then you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s only been a few weeks since you were paralyzed. If I can wait fifteen years for a miracle, then so can you.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen years? No way. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>Grace shrugged and continued to massage his calves. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice. I\u2019m not letting you give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your decision.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him then and tears glittered in her sad brown eyes. \u201cUntil you can move, it\u2019s not yours, either.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Paul saw Zach coming down the hall toward him like a battering ram. His leopard green eyes were red and sunken from lack of sleep, and his light brown skin had a sickly gray cast to it. Paul hadn\u2019t seen him in two weeks, and in that time he\u2019d grown thinner, more desperate.</p><p>All the Theronai had heard the rumors that he\u2019d possibly found his lady last month, and that she\u2019d run from him. He\u2019d been looking for her ever since. With no luck.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d demanded Zach.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women you brought here. I need to see them. Make sure they\u2019re not my Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Paul held up his hands to stop Zach from moving past him. \u201cThey\u2019re not Lexi. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Zach struggled against Paul\u2019s hold. \u201cYou might be wrong.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t, but he didn\u2019t say that. Diplomacy was a better, safer course of action here. \u201cAndra is about five-ten with short dark hair. Nika is about five-seven and has long, white hair. They both have blue eyes. Does that sound like Lexi?\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s shoulders slumped in defeat and his head fell forward. \u201cNo. She\u2019s little. Not that tall. Damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, man. I know this is killing you. Have there been any leads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple. She\u2019s always gone by the time I get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true that the bloodmark you put on her isn\u2019t working?\u201d Paul had heard rumors, but he hadn\u2019t believed them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know how she did it, but she\u2019s been able to block it somehow.\u201d</p><p>Paul laid a hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr die trying,\u201d said Zach, and he turned around and went back the way he came.</p><p>Paul stared at his friend, watching him practically stagger away. Zach had always been so proud and strong, and now he was reduced to a desperate mess.</p><p>And he\u2019d spent only moments with Lexi.</p><p>Paul had been with Andra for two days now. If she walked away from him, he was going to suffer much worse than Zach did before he died.</p><p>At least he still had hope. Andra might want to stick around. Zach had been rejected outright. It was a wonder he was still breathing.</p><p>If Zach didn\u2019t find Lexi soon, there was going to be another sword hung in the Hall of the Fallen before too much longer. Paul was sure of it.</p><p>Another brother lost.</p><p>Grief welled up in Paul until it threatened to choke him. They were dying too fast. All of them. Not just his brothers, but the Sanguinar, too. He\u2019d even heard the Slayers\u2019 ranks were shrinking at an alarming rate, their thinning bloodlines no longer able to support the magic they once wielded.</p><p>If something didn\u2019t change soon, the Synestryn were going to win and overrun the earth. They\u2019d slaughter every human alive, no matter how small a trace of powerful blood they had, and they\u2019d use that power to open the gate to the Solarc\u2019s kingdom. There\u2019d be no one left to stop them.</p><p>One problem at a time. That was what he needed to focus on. If he thought about his future, or lack thereof, he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep going, and that was what Andra needed him to do. Keep going.</p><p>They\u2019d just finished eating, and Andra was back checking on Nika when Paul heard a quiet knock on his door. He opened it to find Joseph standing there with Tynan, one of the Sanguinar.</p><p>Paul hesitated to let them in. He didn\u2019t want to disturb Nika\u2019s rest, but even more than that, he didn\u2019t want one of the Sanguinar anywhere near the women. Tynan was going to want their blood. His protective instincts made that hard for him to accept, even though he knew Tynan was on their side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cSibyl has already left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will she be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She left a note saying that you should have come earlier, as she asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t bring her earlier. It was too risky for Nika. She damn well should have known that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she did. You can ask her when she gets back. In the meantime, I brought Tynan to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see the women,\u201d said Tynan.</p><p>Paul let them in. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to see Andra. Ni ka\u2019s the sick one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must catalog Andra\u2019s blood as well,\u201d said Tynan.</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way. Logan\u2019s already had enough. Get him to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that he\u2019s taken is gone. Used up to keep the hospital occupants from seeing the attack. We need more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit.\u201d</p><p>Tynan\u2019s too-pretty face was smooth and impassive. He was inhumanly pale and his icy blue eyes dropped to Paul\u2019s bare throat. \u201cYou\u2019ve claimed her. She\u2019s one of ours now. You can\u2019t deny the need to study her blood.\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s blood. Just a little, but more than Paul was willing to give them. \u201cYou don\u2019t need it now. Maybe later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater might be too late,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cYou never know what might happen, and we need to be able to figure out where she came from. Another woman capable of uniting with our men just appears\u2014with a blood sister, no less\u2014and you\u2019re standing there telling me that it isn\u2019t important that we track her bloodline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important to me.\u201d</p><p>Joseph\u2019s face darkened with anger. \u201cOf course not. You\u2019ve already got your lady. What about the rest of us? We\u2019re losing ground day by day and you\u2019re standing in the way of our researching her bloodline? I didn\u2019t think you were that selfish.\u201d</p><p>Paul winced. It was selfish, but the thought of spilling Andra\u2019s blood and giving it to yet one more of the Sanguinar was more than he could stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s her choice. Not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer life is in your keeping,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cYou\u2019ve claimed her as your own. Who better to trust with the decision to spill a small portion of her blood? With you here, watching over her, how could she come to harm? You\u2019d cut me down before I had a chance to take too much.\u201d</p><p>Paul felt his hand sliding to his sword. It wouldn\u2019t take much to reach out and grab it. He\u2019d never liked Tynan. He was too smooth. Too emotionless. Like a reptile.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t negotiable, Paul,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cI\u2019m not giving you or the women a choice. We need to know where they came from and how we missed finding them until now, and the only man who can do that is Tynan. So lead us to the women or just get the hell out of our way, but this is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d asked Andra from behind him.</p><p>Paul went to her and placed his body in front of hers in an openly protective gesture. \u201cThey want some of your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor research purposes,\u201d explained Joseph. \u201cWe hope to find out more about you, about how you\u2019re able to absorb Paul\u2019s power without harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think my blood will tell you why I\u2019m a magic sponge?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Tynan laughed, letting out a melodious, completely inhuman sound. \u201cLovely image. Fitting. I think I\u2019m going to like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop flirting with my woman,\u201d growled Paul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour woman?\u201d asked Andra in a tone that was part warning, part feminine curiosity.</p><p>Paul felt his face heat. He was overstepping his bounds. He had to remember that. She did not belong to him no matter how much he wished otherwise. She could do as she chose.</p><p>The idea pissed him off.</p><p>Paul stepped aside so he was no longer shielding her body from the leech. \u201cYou want him to suck on you? Fine. Be my guest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh. As in bloodsucking vampire? Like Logan? That kind of suck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Paul, feeling pleased with her appropriate disgust.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Joseph and Tynan at the same time.</p><p>Andra looked between the three men and took a half step closer to Paul. \u201cSorry. I gave at the office,\u201d she told the men.</p><p>Tynan shot her a fabulous, model-beautiful smile full of white teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s painless. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what all the vampires say,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cLovely creature. I do hope your sister is like you. We could use a little humor to lighten up the place. All these stodgy old Theronai are about as much fun as a funeral.\u201d</p><p>Joseph let out a low growl of warning. \u201cBack off, leech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean? No fun at all. But you and I, dear, we could have plenty of fun together.\u201d Tynan\u2019s voice dripped with promise. He took a step nearer Andra, and another. Paul unsheathed his sword and held the naked blade in front of Tynan\u2019s too-pretty neck.</p><p>\u201cNot one step farther,\u201d he warned the Sanguinar.</p><p>Tynan held up his hands in surrender, but it wasn\u2019t his hands that were dangerous. It was his icy blue eyes\u2014the kind that would mesmerize prey and hold them still while he fed. Those eyes were fixed firmly on Andra and she wasn\u2019t looking away.</p> <p>\u201cApparently this is a bad time,\u201d said Tynan.</p><p>\u201cAnytime is a bad time for you to suck my woman\u2019s blood,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just leave and come back when she\u2019s more willing. I\u2019m sure her sister will hold out that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can help Nika?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cThat is why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d She held out her arms as if letting him choose which one looked tastier. \u201cTake as much as you want. Just help her.\u201d</p><p>Tynan\u2019s eyes brightened with hunger. \u201cSo generous. So selfless. Your sister is lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>Paul tightened his grip on the sword. \u201cHe wants Ni ka\u2019s blood, too, Andra.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t have it. She\u2019s too weak. He\u2019ll have to take mine instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way it works, lovely,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cI\u2019ll need hers, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan said she\u2019s too weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Logan. My skills are far greater than his, which is why I\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d shouted Joseph. \u201cI\u2019m in charge here. You all elected me leader and you\u2019re damn well going to accept that leadership, because I\u2019m sure as hell not doing this job for the fun of it.\u201d</p><p>Paul stared at Joseph, stunned. This outburst wasn\u2019t like him at all.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cTynan is going to take a little\u2014and I mean a little\u2014of Andra\u2019s blood so we can try to figure out where she came from. Paul, you\u2019re going to just sit there and take it. And, Tynan, if I sense even the slightest hint of magic coming off of you, I\u2019m going to cut off your closest appendage with my sword\u2014likely your head. You can get your leech buddies to reattach it, if you think they\u2019re good enough.\u201d</p><p>Paul looked at Andra, ignoring Joseph\u2019s orders. He didn\u2019t care if they cast him out for defiance. She was his to protect, and he was not going to be forsworn the day after he made the vow to do so. He stepped in front of her so that she could see only him. \u201cAre you really going to allow Tynan to take some of your blood? We can fight them.\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s blue eyes widened in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m deadly serious. Those are our only two options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t fight these guys. They\u2019re the good guys. Right?\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded. \u201cThough \u2018good\u2019 may be stretching it a bit. We are on the same side of the war, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Besides, he\u2019s the one who\u2019s going to help Nika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do whatever I can,\u201d said Tynan.</p><p>Andra pulled in a deep breath and said to Tynan, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Take some blood from me, but there\u2019d damn well better be juice and cookies waiting for me when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Andra was beginning to dislike the vampires almost as much as Paul and Madoc seemed to. If this kept up, she was going to be sucked dry before the week was out.</p><p>Paul stood over her, his hand on his sword, while Andra sat at the kitchen table next to Tynan. Joseph had excused himself to deal with some kind of emergency, warning Tynan to tread carefully.</p><p>\u201cI promise this won\u2019t hurt,\u201d said Tynan as he leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cTouch her neck and you die right here,\u201d warned Paul.</p><p>Andra looked up at him and couldn\u2019t help but stare. She\u2019d never seen him look so fierce, not even when he\u2019d faced down those demons who\u2019d stolen Sammy. He looked like a warrior bent on revenge, barely in control of his anger. His broad shoulders blocked out the light from the living room behind him, casting his body into silhouette. Shadows flowed over the side of his face, throwing his masculine features into harsh relief. His jaw was clenched and his nostrils flared.</p><p>Andra touched his arm in an effort to soothe him, but succeeded only in making him flinch. \u201cHurry up and finish,\u201d he told Tynan.</p><p>\u201cYour arm, my lady,\u201d said Tynan.</p><p>Andra was no one\u2019s lady, but she didn\u2019t stop to argue the point. She wasn\u2019t sure how much longer Paul could hold out. She could feel his possessiveness smoldering through their bond.</p><p>Andra extended her arm. \u201cYou promise it won\u2019t hurt?\u201d</p><p>Tynan gave her a suave smile that would have made most women\u2019s panties melt. \u201cJust look into my eyes and it will be over before you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d barked Paul. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d His voice was so raw the words were hardly decipherable.</p><p>Andra wasn\u2019t sure whether she was more flattered or annoyed at Paul\u2019s possessiveness. If it hadn\u2019t been for their connection and the fear for her she felt coming off of him in waves, she might have been pissed off at his barbaric declaration. As it was, she knew that he was only trying to protect her from what he perceived as a threat. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to look at him, then maybe you should be the one to distract me,\u201d said Andra with what she hoped was a seductive smile.</p><p>He leaned down, fisted his hand in her short hair, eased her head back, and took possession of her mouth in a searing kiss. Andra\u2019s world tilted on one end and she sighed into his mouth. Her free hand came up and wrapped around the nape of his neck to hold him in place so he couldn\u2019t pull away this time. Somewhere beyond the floating sphere of Paul\u2019s kiss Andra was dimly aware that something was being done to her other arm. She didn\u2019t care what.</p><p>Paul\u2019s tongue teased her mouth open and she tasted his growl of approval as he slid inside. His hand tightened in her hair\u2014a pleasurable bite of pain. He pressed her back into the chair, his lips and tongue sliding over hers in a near-frenetic need.</p><p>Andra\u2019s belly warmed and her limbs became pliant and willing. The luceria hummed happily, resonating with the purring of his ring against her throat. His hot fingers pressed against the pulse in her neck, and she was sure that the blood thrumming there had heated to near boiling.</p><p>Her breathing sped up, and she could feel the flush of desire sweeping up her chest. Everything outside the two of them faded away into meaninglessness. She\u2019d never felt anything so consuming before, and had there been any room left inside her tingling body for fear, she would have been terrified. This was not the kind of kiss that ended with each of them going their separate ways. This was the kind of kiss that melded hearts together and changed lives. There was a kind of magic in it\u2014a kind of power that wove them together with delicate tendrils of need. Andra was sure that there was nothing short of naked, sweaty sex that was going to quench the fire that burned in her belly.</p><p>She was all for it.</p><p>Paul\u2019s body tensed with effort; then she felt him start to pull away. Andra tightened her grip on him, using all her strength to hold him in place. But he was stronger and he captured her hand in his and held it at bay.</p><p>Andra was left panting, needy, aching. Now that they were apart, she could feel Paul\u2019s lust\u2014separate from her own\u2014crashing over her in violent waves. He wanted her as much as she\u2019d wanted him and yet he\u2019d stopped.</p><p>Slowly, as her muddled mind cleared, she remembered they had an audience.</p><p>Andra\u2019s face was already flushed with passion, so she was sure that no one noticed her blush.</p><p>Tynan cleared his throat with a delicate cough. \u201cI\u2019m, ah, finished.\u201d</p><p>Andra pulled her hand away and looked at her wrist. There was nothing there but unblemished skin. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a thing,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d muttered Tynan. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo help Nika,\u201d ordered Paul. He was standing a few feet away, facing mostly toward the windows. Andra could see the pained expression on his face, and the rigid control he was trying to maintain.</p><p>Tynan\u2019s dark brows rose. \u201cAre you unwell, Theronai?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Go help Nika.\u201d</p><p>Andra stood, needing to touch him\u2014to soothe him. She reached for him.</p><p>Paul jerked away. \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer or I\u2019ll have you naked on the floor under me in thirty seconds. I don\u2019t care who\u2019s watching.\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s body was shimmering inside with the residual effects of their kiss. It took an effort of will to gather her composure and keep herself from running her hands over Paul\u2019s taut back.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d said Andra, glancing at Tynan. \u201cNika needs you.\u201d</p><p>Tynan bowed his head. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d she asked Paul, starting to grow concerned.</p><p>\u201cYes. This is just the Sanguinar\u2019s version of a joke. I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Andra wasn\u2019t laughing. She ached too much to find any of this funny.</p><p>She looked at Tynan\u2019s face and couldn\u2019t see a sign of any humor lurking in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Andra took Tynan to the room where Nika was resting. The door opened quietly. It was dark, so Andra flipped on the lights. Nika didn\u2019t move, but she\u2019d spent years having doctors and nurses invade her sleep, so she was probably used to it by now.</p><p>She was so thin and frail, almost skeletal. Her pale hair blended in with the stark white pillows. Blue veins spread out across her temples and over the backs of her hands. The bruises from the restraints and IVs were dark, ugly marks that hadn\u2019t yet begun to heal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andra\u2019s heart broke open and bled for her sister. If this didn\u2019t work . . .</p><p>\u201cHow long has she been asleep?\u201d he asked, frowning at Nika.</p><p>\u201cHours. She woke up and had a little bit to eat before we left Nebraska, but she slept the rest of the way here. Madoc gave her some water when we arrived, but she went right back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Tynan sat on the edge of the bed. He picked up her bony hand with exquisite care. His long fingers hovered over her pulse for a moment. When he looked up at Andra, his face was grim. \u201cShe\u2019s not sleeping anymore. She\u2019s unconscious.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 19</p><p>Andra locked her knees to keep from falling. \u201cAre you sure? I thought she was getting better when Madoc managed to get her to eat. I never would have left her side if I\u2019d thought otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Guilt ate at her, making her stomach turn. She was so swept up in Paul and his world that she hadn\u2019t even noticed her sister had gotten worse.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been unconscious for long, but I can feel her slipping away. Her body is getting weaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t know until I have some of her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s weak, that will only make things worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need only a drop or two.\u201d He was looking at her for permission.</p><p>Andra had no choice. No options. \u201cOkay, but no more.\u201d</p><p>Tynan nodded and put Nika\u2019s finger to his mouth. Andra saw him pierce the tip with his sharp fang, and just as quickly his tongue swiped over it, sealing her skin.</p><p>He froze. Nika\u2019s hand slipped from his grasp and fell back to the bed. His eyes started to dart around like crazy\u2014just like Logan\u2019s had done\u2014and a deep moan rose up from his throat.</p> <p>Andra held back her panic. She didn\u2019t know what was going on here, but she wasn\u2019t going to leave Nika in the way if Tynan started thrashing around. She moved around the bed to gather Nika in her arms and get her out of the way just as Tynan\u2019s eyes slowed and he let out a harsh breath.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to hear her. \u201cThat poor child,\u201d he whispered, and looked at Nika as if she were already dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d demanded Andra.</p><p>\u201cHer blood.\u201d He wiped his mouth like he didn\u2019t want to risk tasting any more of it. \u201cI know why she\u2019s suffering.\u201d He looked up at Andra and his expression was that of a doctor giving a family member the worst news possible. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI can get her to eat and help her body heal, but there\u2019s nothing I can do for her mind.\u201d</p><p>Andra held back her tears through sheer force of will. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Synestryn got her blood somehow.\u201d</p><p>Andra knew how. \u201cOur family was attacked when she was twelve. One of those things ripped her leg open.\u201d She couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell him that the monster had licked Nika\u2019s blood from her wound and Andra hadn\u2019t done a thing to stop it. She\u2019d just stood there, letting it happen.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder she lived. Their claws and saliva are poisonous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was sick for a long time, but she got better. At least, I thought she had. It took a while before I realized that she wasn\u2019t . . . herself.\u201d Those first few weeks had nearly been more than Andra could take. Her mother had been killed. Her baby sister had been missing and presumed dead, though Andra refused to believe it. Nika had been in the hospital, holding on to life by a thread. Andra was alone, making all the decisions herself. She had been nineteen, just starting college. She was barely old enough to be out on her own, much less holding the fate of two children in her hands. She was torn between hunting for Tori or staying with Nika. She tried to do both, but exhaustion put her into the hospital, too, and the choice was made for her.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to turn to her mom so badly, be held and told everything was going to be okay. But Mom was dead and the doctors kept looking to Andra for all the decisions. She had no choice but to suck it up. So she had.</p><p>\u201cYour sister is psychic, isn\u2019t she?\u201d asked Tynan.</p><p>Andra nodded slowly. She\u2019d always written it off as creepy coincidences, but it was true. Nika had known a lot of things she shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cIs that why she\u2019s like this? Why she thinks she sees things that aren\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blood that was taken from her forged a connection with the sgath who took it\u2014a kind of mental link. She could have handled that, but it got worse. Somehow, the blood of that creature was consumed by many others. Nika\u2019s presence inside of that sgath was split each time her blood was passed on. From what I can tell, this has happened more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell all of that from a drop or two of blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t look like it made him happy.</p><p>\u201cSo why can\u2019t you fix it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not skilled enough. There is a Sanguinar in Europe who may be, but even that\u2019s not likely.\u201d</p><p>Hopeless rage filled Andra up until she shook. \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Nika\u2019s been cut into too many pieces. There\u2019s not enough left to put her back together, and even if we could, the scars would likely leave her mind ruined. It\u2019s best if you let her go. Let her suffering end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d whispered Andra. She couldn\u2019t let Nika go, too. She couldn\u2019t be alone.</p><p>Warm, strong hands settled on her shoulders. Paul. She hadn\u2019t even seen him come in the room.</p><p>\u201cYou heard her, Tynan,\u201d said Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re not letting her go. You can have whatever blood you need, but you can\u2019t give up on her.\u201d</p><p>Tynan stood. \u201cAs you wish. I will go and research what must be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will that take?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t proceed without speaking to my brothers and gathering my strength.\u201d</p><p>Paul said, \u201cI\u2019ll call on the Theronai to donate blood to the cause. Every one of the men will be hoping Nika is his lady. You should get plenty of volunteers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave them meet me in our lounge after sunset tomorrow. I\u2019ll need at least that much time to prepare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to speak to Sibyl, too, as soon as she gets back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cAny advice she can give will be welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you take advice from her?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>\u201cSince the life of that woman hangs in the balance.\u201d Tynan turned and left.</p><p>Andra couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t speak. She\u2019d fought so long and hard for Nika, and it still hadn\u2019t been enough. Nothing she\u2019d ever done had been good enough when it came to her family.</p><p>She\u2019d failed over and over, and nothing she\u2019d heard made her believe that this time would be any different. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered to her sister. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby.\u201d</p><p>Paul pulled her back against his chest and held her tight. His arms felt warm, strong, and comforting. Part of her wanted to turn in to him and hide in his strength, but the rest of her wanted to shove him away and scream at him for making her soft. She couldn\u2019t be soft right now.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d he said. \u201cStop pushing me away. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re my wife, which makes her my sister, too.\u201d</p><p>Shock froze her tongue in place for a moment. She turned around and looked up at him. \u201cWife? I never agreed to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing my luceria. It\u2019s the closest thing my people have to marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not married.\u201d</p><p>He flinched and his jaw hardened. \u201cFine, we\u2019re not married as you know it, but I still feel like she\u2019s my family. I would do anything in my power to save her.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Andra was pushing away the only ally she had. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you\u2019re trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was Madoc. But you sent him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s unstable. You said so yourself.\u201d</p><p>Paul smoothed her hair back from her temple. His touch was gentle, almost loving. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand how it is for us, living with pain the way we do for centuries. It makes our edges rougher. Makes us angry and desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCenturies? You live that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will you.\u201d</p><p>Shock rippled through Andra, silencing her. It didn\u2019t seem possible, but there was a lot of that going around lately.</p><p>She gathered her wits enough to speak, but not enough to keep from blurting out the truth. \u201cLiving eight years with the guilt of letting my family die, of not being able to help Nika, is more than enough. I can\u2019t imagine several lifetimes of that kind of torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one said longevity was easy. We all carry burdens, and in the case of the male Theronai, we also can endure decades of crushing pain. That pain makes Madoc harsh, but I swear he\u2019d never hurt Nika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take any chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed to do better when he was around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>Paul shook his head. \u201cWhat if it wasn\u2019t? Nika needs all the help she can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fair enough.\u201d He kissed her head and moved away. \u201cI\u2019m going to go round up the men and get them to feed Tynan so he\u2019s strong enough to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I want you to come back, so we can try to help her again, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, Andra. It\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Paul had to fight himself to walk away from Andra. She needed comfort and he wanted to be right here where he could hold her. But she needed Nika more, so he forced himself to leave and do what he could to help.</p><p>He found Joseph sitting in his office even though it was well past time that he should have stopped working for the day. Through the window behind him, Paul saw several Theronai and humans in the training yard, practicing swordplay or pumping iron. Joseph should have been out there with them, blowing off some steam to ease the pain Paul knew he felt, but instead Joseph was here in his office, poring over a large map. Idly, he slid his fingers back and forth over the luceria around his throat. Even though Joseph was unbound, he had refused to visit Nika to see if she could be his mate.</p><p>Paul was going to have to do something to change his mind. More than any of the Theronai, Joseph needed to stay strong so he could lead his people. Without him, there would be chaos and people they loved would die.</p><p>Paul stepped inside the room to get a better view and recognized the map as a copy of the one they used to track Synestryn nests and sightings. Red dots littered the thing, ringing around Dabyr as if it were a bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>They were closing in. None of the Synestryn had broken through their security here yet, but it was only a matter of time before they found a way in.</p><p>That was why the humans trained. There was no guarantee the Sentinels would live long enough to protect them from that eventuality. They had to learn to protect themselves, though how they would do that, Paul had no idea. They simply weren\u2019t physically capable of that kind of strength. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate to bother you, but I need a favor,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>Joseph leaned back and rubbed his eyes. He looked like he hadn\u2019t slept in days. \u201cSure. What\u2019s one more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you\u2019ve got a lot on your plate, but this might actually help in the long run.\u201d</p><p>Joseph motioned for Paul to sit. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAndra\u2019s sister might not make it, but Tynan is going to try to help her. I need you to issue a call for blood to all the Theronai and Gerai.\u201d</p><p>Joseph let out a heavy sigh. \u201cSince Helen showed up last month, more and more of the men have left to go hunt for their own ladies. Now that you\u2019ve found Andra, it\u2019s going to get even worse. There aren\u2019t many Theronai left here, but I\u2019ll issue the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should call the men back for this\u2014lure them back with the hope of Nika\u2019s survival. If she lives, she may be compatible with one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if she is, what about those who aren\u2019t compatible? I\u2019m going to have a pile of pissed Theronai on my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter that than a dead woman.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph held up his hand as if to ward away any more pressure. \u201cI know, I know. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to meet her first?\u201d asked Paul. \u201cSee if she might be yours?\u201d</p><p>Joseph kept his head down, but he couldn\u2019t hide the hopeful light that glittered in his eyes for a moment. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m still holding it together. Sixteen leaves left as of this morning. Let the others go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways the last in line, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only one of the many benefits of leadership,\u201d said Joseph on a sigh. He looked tired. Worn down.</p><p>Paul felt concern tug at him. If Joseph didn\u2019t survive, they had little hope of keeping any semblance of order. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got another eight years left on your term. Are you going to make it?\u201d</p> <p>The man shrugged. \u201cProbably not, but I\u2019ll get as far through my two decades as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome see Nika,\u201d urged Paul. Their leader needed to be strong. Having a lady at his side would ensure that like nothing else could.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later. I\u2019ve got to get some things done first. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll put the blood order out within the hour. Nicholas has some way of calling all the men back automatically via text message or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. This means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. Once all the men show up, you\u2019re not going to get a moment\u2019s peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one but you gets near Nika until she\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>Joseph leaned back in his chair, his hazel eyes dark with worry. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to post a guard then. You know how hard it\u2019s going to be for the men to stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea. Maybe Angus or Drake is a good choice.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph nodded. Both men were bonded Theronai. She\u2019d be safe with them. \u201cThey\u2019re out hunting, but I\u2019ll have them report back, too. Who knows? Maybe Gilda could even help her. She has a decent amount of healing ability herself, and it doesn\u2019t cost us any blood if she does it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take all the help we can get,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>Joseph\u2019s eyes went back to the map, and he suddenly looked older than he should have. \u201cI hope Nika lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need her if we\u2019re going to hold the Synestryn back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if she does live, she\u2019s not going to be in any condition to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d give her time to heal, of course, but we need everyone we\u2019ve got out on the front lines fighting. You and Andra will need to get out there, too.\u201d</p><p>Paul couldn\u2019t look the man in the eyes, but he had to tell Joseph of his failure. The man didn\u2019t need any more bad news, but Paul owed him the truth. \u201cI think I made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club,\u201d said Joseph.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean a big one.\u201d</p><p>Joseph rubbed his temples as if they throbbed. Exasperation filled his tone. \u201cWe all make big ones. In our line of work, those are the only kind out there. What I wouldn\u2019t give to have overdue bills or a leaky toilet or, hell, even a drug-addicted teen to deal with. Instead, I get to deal with determining the fate of the freaking planet. And most of those people I\u2019m working to save don\u2019t even know I exist. I make a mistake, the human race ends. So, tell me, just what is it you think you did that\u2019s so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve bonded with a woman I can\u2019t keep.\u201d</p><p>Joseph stood slowly, all signs of fatigue gone. \u201cWhat do you mean, you can\u2019t keep her? Of course you\u2019re going to keep her.\u201d</p><p>Paul looked down at his ring. Three shades of blue swirled and writhed within the iridescent band. As long as the color wasn\u2019t fixed, he still had time to walk away, but he\u2019d be back where he started with only days to live. \u201cShe only gave me three days.\u201d</p><p>Joseph\u2019s shoulders bowed under the weight of that news. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. Doesn\u2019t she know what\u2019s at stake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, all she can worry about is her sister. Give her some time.\u201d</p><p>Joseph slammed his hand down on the map covered in red. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any more time. We need her. Do whatever it takes, but bind her to you for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear it, Paul,\u201d demanded Joseph, leadership ringing in his voice. \u201cSwear you\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>The urge to give in and make his vow was so strong it made Paul\u2019s stomach clench. \u201cI can\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t belong in our world. If she doesn\u2019t want to be here, I won\u2019t force her to stay. After our time is up, I\u2019m letting her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are.\u201d Joseph leaned forward over the desk and gave Paul a serious frown. \u201cMake things work out with her. We need her. It\u2019s your duty to convince her to stay and make sure she\u2019s happy once she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Paul! You\u2019d better be taking this seriously. We\u2019re all counting on you. All of the Theronai need you to make this work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make her stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. Our men are out there every day risking their lives so that others won\u2019t even have to know about the dangers we face. We allow humans to live in the bliss of ignorance and all we ask in return is that when one of them turns up able to aid our fight, they do so. It\u2019s not much to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept to the one who is unlucky enough to join the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d snarled Joseph. \u201cI\u2019m done with waging a noble war. We\u2019re fighting demons. And worse. They\u2019re closing in on us more every day. We\u2019ll all die if you don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, now I\u2019m responsible for the lives of all the Theronai, too? Don\u2019t you think I have enough pressure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not, or you\u2019d find a way to tie her to you so tight she\u2019d never be able to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want it, Joseph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck what she wants. Make her want it if you have to.\u201d</p><p>Magic. Coercion. That was what Joseph was talking about. Paul knew, because he\u2019d had those very same thoughts. \u201cYou don\u2019t see a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>Joseph reached around the desk, took Paul\u2019s arm, and dragged him toward the window overlooking the training field. He pointed a thick finger at the glass. \u201cLook out there. I see seven good men who don\u2019t have a year left to live. I have a problem with that.\u201d</p><p>Paul wanted to avert his eyes, but he couldn\u2019t. Those men were his friends. His family. He couldn\u2019t let them lose hope. Maybe Joseph was right. Maybe what Andra wanted wasn\u2019t as important as giving his people a reason to live\u2014the hope that there might be more women out there like her. The hope that they might not lose this war.</p><p>\u201cYou take a good look,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cRemember those faces when you see your woman. Every one of those men would do whatever it took to save you. I think you owe them the same thing.\u201d</p><p>He did. He owed them his life. His soul.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t just his life at stake. It was Andra\u2019s.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t want to stay with him, he wouldn\u2019t force her. He knew how desperate things were, but if he had to force Andra\u2019s compliance, he didn\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>Paul steadied his nerve. He didn\u2019t like this any more than Joseph, but he couldn\u2019t give in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I won\u2019t force her. It\u2019s got to be her choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen pray to God that she makes the right one.\u201d His voice sounded heavy, worried.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>Joseph shook his head. His shoulders seemed to bow a little farther under an invisible burden. \u201cWe can\u2019t let her go. If you won\u2019t do what\u2019s necessary, I\u2019ll find a man who will. Surely she\u2019ll be compatible with one of our men.\u201d</p><p>Rage rose up inside Paul, furious and ugly. \u201cIf you do, you\u2019d better wait until after I draw my very last breath, because any man who tries to take her by force will have to come through me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t kill one of your brothers in arms.\u201d</p><p>Paul hated himself for realizing the truth. Maybe his feelings for Andra were intensified by the union they shared, or maybe he would have felt this way regardless of their bond. Either way, he wasn\u2019t going to let her be forced into a life of death and fear unless it was her choice.</p><p>\u201cFor her,\u201d he told Joseph, \u201cfor her, I would.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Madoc felt as if his skin were going to split open. He needed sex, but he couldn\u2019t get it here\u2014at least, not the kind he needed to take off the edge. The Gerai women\u2014especially Thea\u2014were willing to take what he needed to give. They just weren\u2019t able. He\u2019d end up hurting one of them, and then there\u2019d be hell to pay.</p><p>Violence was his second choice. There was a whole world full of Synestryn out there that needed killing, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave Dabyr to do the job. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave Nika.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He shoved the loaded barbell up again, hoping that the physical exertion of weight lifting would hold him together for just a few more hours. Sweat poured off his body and his heart felt like it would explode, but he kept on pushing.</p><p>\u201cNeed a spot?\u201d asked Neal. The Theronai\u2019s body bulged with muscle. He was more than able to give Madoc a hand.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d grunted Madoc.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d said Neal. \u201cI need to get back to training anyway. Playtime\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>But the man didn\u2019t leave. He stood there, watching silently as Madoc shoved the bar back up.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you looking at?\u201d asked Madoc.</p><p>Neal shrugged his huge shoulders. \u201cNothing. Just wondering if you\u2019d heard about the call for blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d Madoc\u2019s arms shook as he brought the weight back down to his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? I heard Paul found himself a female Theronai. She has a full-blooded sister who\u2019s sick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was there. Know all about it.\u201d</p><p>Neal hunkered down, his eyes lighting with interest. \u201cYou\u2019ve met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to donate blood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot my woman. Not my problem.\u201d</p><p>Neal made a sound of disgust. \u201cSelfish bastard. Just because she\u2019s not yours doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it does.\u201d His arms started to shake under the strain of the weight. His muscles burned and he pulled in some air to fuel them.</p><p>\u201cShe may not be compatible with me, either, but I\u2019m going to donate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Better for the leeches,\u201d said Madoc.</p> <p>This blood order reminded him way too much of the way it had been with Torr. Nearly every man here had bled into Tynan, and it still hadn\u2019t been enough to save Torr. Poor bastard was still alive, but locked inside his useless body, trapped and unable to get out.</p><p>Madoc would have rather died.</p><p>What if that was what happened to Nika? What if they weren\u2019t able to save her?</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cBetter for the woman,\u201d responded Neal. \u201cHow can you live with yourself, man? Don\u2019t you care about anyone but yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>Madoc racked the bar and pushed himself to his feet. He couldn\u2019t sit around and do nothing. He had to get out of here before he went crazy. Go find a hooker. Get laid. Maybe hunt down some nasties.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an embarrassment,\u201d said Neal. \u201cWe took vows to protect others even if it cost our lives. Donating blood doesn\u2019t even hurt.\u201d</p><p>Madoc\u2019s tank top hid the fact that his lifemark was mostly bare. The Band had inked him with a couple of fake leaves that were good enough to fool anyone not looking too closely, but Madoc didn\u2019t trust Neal not to look. Nothing got by that man. If he\u2019d known Madoc was out of time, he would have him shipped off to the Slayers before dawn. Game over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting any fucking bloodsuckers in my head,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>\u201cEven if it means the woman dies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to die.\u201d Madoc grabbed a towel and wiped the sweat from his body. He was tired of being in public, tired of pretending he was still one of them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that, but I hope you\u2019re right. For your sake as well as hers. That kind of guilt is a heavy load.\u201d</p><p>What if Neal was right? What if they didn\u2019t get enough blood for her? Most of the men were out hunting for their own women and hardly anyone was home. It could take days for them all to return. Days Nika didn\u2019t have.</p> <p>Fuck.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let that happen. Not to Nika.</p><p>He stomped away from Neal and called Nicholas on his cell.</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s surprised voice came over the line. \u201cMadoc. You never call. You never write. I was starting to think you didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck the small talk. Where\u2019s Tynan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds serious. Hold on,\u201d said Nicholas. There was some typing in the background; then the head of security came back on the line. \u201cHe\u2019s headed from the dining hall toward the Sanguinar wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stop him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll lock the doors, but why\u2014\u201d</p><p>Madoc hung up and broke into a jog. People looked at him funny as he sped by, but he didn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>Tynan was pushing on the locked door when Madoc found him. The leech turned around and his icy eyes went wide with fear.</p><p>Good. That was going to make this easier.</p><p>Madoc scanned the walls for the security camera, found it, and ripped it down. Bits of plastic crumbled inside his fist and he dropped the broken mess to the tile floor.</p><p>\u201cMadoc,\u201d said Tynan. He held his hands up in front of him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dying, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Tynan blinked for a moment, as if he hadn\u2019t expected the question, and it took him a second to catch up. \u201cNika?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Nika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do everything for her I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d</p><p>Tynan\u2019s eyes moved around as if looking for an escape. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m afraid she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you fix her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t yet know. I still have to do some research and see if this kind of thing has ever happened before. And there\u2019s always an issue of having the strength to help her even if I do find out how.\u201d</p><p>Madoc prowled closer and lowered his voice so no one else could hear. \u201cTake mine.\u201d</p><p>Tynan pressed himself harder against the door, as if trying to get away. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Madoc held out his arm. \u201cTake my blood. Use it to save her.\u201d</p><p>The Sanguinar\u2019s eyes flared with hunger. \u201cYou\u2019ve never before given your blood to any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking know that. Do you want it or not?\u201d Madoc bobbed his thick arm in front of the leech.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was an eerie, hissing sound that gave Madoc second thoughts for a split second. He knew he was going to regret this\u2014he just didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d asked Tynan, licking his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need to save her.\u201d Madoc wasn\u2019t going to last much longer anyway at this rate. He might as well do something decent with his blood.</p><p>Tentatively, Tynan wrapped his slim fingers around Madoc\u2019s arm and brought his wrist to his mouth. Madoc had expected it to hurt, but his life had been all about pain for so long, a couple of fang pricks didn\u2019t even register. All he felt was a strong tugging motion against his skin, and even that started to fade away within moments.</p><p>Slowly, a hazy kind of weakness filled Madoc\u2019s limbs. It didn\u2019t bother him or worry him, but he knew it wasn\u2019t right. His body grew heavy, and he decided it was a good idea to sit down. Tynan seemed stronger than normal and had no trouble easing him to the floor without breaking his hold on Madoc\u2019s arm.</p><p>Buzzing filled his head and his eyes grew heavy. He really needed a nap and wished to hell he could go curl himself around Nika so no one could get to her.</p><p>The odd thought was gone as quickly as it came. Madoc didn\u2019t have the strength to walk right now, anyway. Not that he cared. He didn\u2019t care about a fucking thing.</p><p>Tynan felt as if he were flying. For the first time in decades he wasn\u2019t starving. Wasn\u2019t cold. Power roared through his veins, a heady mixture of strength and invincibility. Madoc\u2019s blood was pure. No one else had ever partaken of his vast power, which had only grown over the centuries. Tynan had never tasted anything like it, and probably never would again.</p><p>What he\u2019d drunk from Madoc was enough to fuel his body for decades if he limited the amount of magic he used. Too bad he couldn\u2019t keep all that giddy power for himself. He had to share.</p><p>Nika wasn\u2019t the only one in need. Selfishness was not an option if his kind were to survive. Threescore Sanguinar occupied the sleeping chamber in the depths of the compound, and spread out among them, the blood he could spare and still aid Nika would last for only a few months at best. But at least that was a few more months than they had now.</p><p>Tynan slammed the locked doors open with a scream of shredding metal, leaving Madoc slumped in the hall behind him. Since the security camera had been disabled, Tynan was sure that Nicholas would be coming along any moment to see what had happened to his precious technology. Madoc\u2019s brothers would see to his care.</p><p>Tynan wondered if they knew what Madoc was hiding from all of them\u2014that his soul had begun to die.</p><p>He briefly thought about telling them, but it was none of his affair and he didn\u2019t want to let on just how much he could learn about a person when he drank from them. It would only scare off the others when their time grew short.</p><p>Besides, Tynan had plenty of his own secrets to keep, including the fact that the blood Madoc had offered could only partly be used to save the girl. He had more important plans for the rest of that power.</p><p>Tynan descended to the lowest level of the south wing, down four flights of stairs, past six layers of security that ensured that only those of his kind could pass. There was currently peace between them and the Theronai, but it had not always been so. The Sanguinar were too vulnerable when they slept. It would be too easy to wipe them out if another war broke out. Secrecy and their usefulness in healing were the only protection they had, and they used both to the best advantage possible.</p><p>He pulled open the heavy steel door that had usually wrenched at his arms, but today he needed merely a slight push to send it flying open. It hit the stone wall with a metallic boom, startling the Sanguinar who stood guard over those who slept.</p><p>Connal shot to his feet, hiding the book he\u2019d been reading behind his back. He was fairly short for one of their kind, but more muscular. It was as if the lack of blood had not hampered his body\u2019s strength. Connal had grass green eyes set in a babyish face that even three centuries could not age. The Sanguinar looked perpetually eighteen and was typically treated with the same level of respect.</p><p>\u201cYou startled me,\u201d said Connal.</p><p>\u201cCatching up on your reading?\u201d asked Tynan.</p><p>\u201cI borrowed it from Briant.\u201d</p><p>Tynan wrinkled his nose in distaste. \u201cTell me it\u2019s not one of his erotic vampire novels.\u201d</p><p>Connal\u2019s boyish face darkened. \u201cHe said it was one of the best. I just thought I\u2019d try it.\u201d</p><p>Tynan shook his head. \u201cYou should stick with the classics. That stuff will rot your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t hurt Briant. That man\u2019s smarter than all of the rest of us put together.\u201d Connal marked his place in the book and set it aside. \u201cWhat are you doing here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to feed the others.\u201d</p><p>Connal\u2019s eyes darkened with hunger and excitement. \u201cThe new girl? She\u2019s blooded?\u201d</p><p>Tynan decided to keep the true source of his power to himself. \u201cVery, but I suggest you keep your distance. Her Theronai is quite . . . protective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be everywhere at once. I\u2019ll find her alone and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do nothing of the sort. You\u2019ll leave the girl alone.\u201d Tynan imbued his words with a hint of his newly acquired power, forcing Connal to listen and obey.</p><p>Connal gave him a quick nod.</p><p>Tynan went to the end of one long wall. Enclosed in that wall were dozens of sleeping Sanguinar. They would stay in their magically enhanced sleep for fifty years before waking. It was the only way the dwindling food supply would hold out. Each year more Sanguinar went to sleep and fewer woke. Even in sleep, some of them died of starvation. Without more food\u2014more powerful blood\u2014there was little anyone could do.</p><p>Tynan pushed on a section of wall and it opened to reveal a small stone bowl. At the bottom of the bowl was a hole that led to a series of tubes that fed each of the sleeping Sanguinar. It didn\u2019t take much blood to keep them alive, but they had to have some, and it had been almost two months since their last feeding.</p><p>At least in sleep they didn\u2019t feel hunger. Tynan wished he could say the same.</p><p>He held his wrist over the bowl and willed his flesh to open. Dark red blood trickled from the small wound into the bowl. With every drop that spilled, Tynan felt his power dwindle. Before he was too weak, he willed his flesh closed and licked the remaining blood from his wrist. He couldn\u2019t waste a drop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The high of actually being full was gone and the familiar hunger pangs were back. Not as bad as before, but not pleasant. It was easy to drown them out when he was working, and he had plenty of work to do. Not only did Nika\u2019s situation require his full attention, but he also had to figure out how such pure bloodlines had gone unnoticed. First Helen\u2019s, now Andra\u2019s and Nika\u2019s. If they could find more women like them, he might be able to save his people from starvation.</p><p>It was more hope than he\u2019d had in decades.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to share with me, brother?\u201d asked Connal. He handed Tynan a jug of saline to clean out the system of tubes and make sure all the precious blood went into the Sanguinar.</p><p>Tynan regarded the young-looking man. Connal had never called him brother before. How odd that he would now. \u201cWhen you are asleep and helpless as a babe, I will feed you. Until then, you must find your own food. There are plenty of blooded humans in the compound. Ask them to sustain you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone of their blood runs as pure as the blood I smelled coming from your veins. The power must feel incredible.\u201d</p><p>Connal\u2019s eyes were too bright. Too greedy. Perhaps it was time for him to sleep. Any Sanguinar who became too desperate became a liability. Their kind could not afford any more weakness than they already suffered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send someone to relieve you of your guard duty while you find sustenance,\u201d said Tynan as he left the chamber.</p><p>He barely managed to close the heavy door, and by the time he did, he was shaking with effort.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to last much longer before he, too, had to sleep. Before then, he had to find out how to save his people from starvation, and these women were the key.</p> <p>He\u2019d made sure of that as he\u2019d fed from Andra\u2014altered her slightly to ensure his kind would be fed.</p><p>Tynan didn\u2019t particularly like manipulating people, but he\u2019d had no choice. His people were starving and he\u2019d been desperate to take action while he had the chance. Paul was a formidable warrior and he had plenty of time alone to taint Andra\u2019s perception of his race. The Theronai looked down on the Sanguinar\u2014thought of them as barbaric for their need to drink blood.</p><p>Tynan had not asked to be born like he was\u2014unable to live without the blood of others. He\u2019d been a victim of his parents\u2019 choices the same as any other child. He could no more help his blood thirst than a deformed child could help their birth defect. It was not fair that his people should suffer, and it was his job to see that they survived.</p><p>He\u2019d done the only thing he could while Paul was so busily distracting Andra with his kisses. He only prayed that what he\u2019d done to her would work. The Sanginar were running out of time, and the remaining traces of the Solarc\u2019s blood in human bloodlines were too weak to sustain his race any longer.</p><p>He\u2019d had no choice. He\u2019d done what he was forced to do. He hoped that one day, if she ever learned of his manipulation, Andra would see that and forgive him.</p><p>Chapter 21</p> <p>Madoc woke to the sight of Nicholas\u2019s worried face and wished like hell he\u2019d stayed asleep. His head pounded more than normal, which, combined with all that spinning, made his stomach give a dangerous heave.</p><p>He had no idea what was wrong. Maybe he\u2019d fallen and bashed his head, or taken a hit in combat hard enough to rattle his brains. Wouldn\u2019t have been the first time.</p><p>Then it came back to him. Tynan. He\u2019d given the leech his blood.</p><p>On the heels of that thought came an even more distressing one. \u201cHow long have I been out? How\u2019s the girl?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas frowned in confusion. \u201cNot long, and what girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNika. Andra\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Madoc pushed himself up to a sitting position and fought off another wave of twisting nausea. He was going to pound Tynan\u2019s pretty face in next time he saw him for taking so much.</p><p>Then again, maybe that was what it was going to take to help Nika.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. I saw the camera go black and I was sure I was going to get here and find Tynan dead on the floor. Instead it was you lying there. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your fucking business,\u201d growled Madoc.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit him? Slam him into the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas rubbed a hand over his face and looked at the door leading to the Sanguinar wing. \u201cThen what the hell happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Madoc turned his head slowly so it wouldn\u2019t spin away and saw the ruins of the steel door. It looked like it had been blown open with a battering ram. The metal was deformed and torn away where the lock had once been. \u201cDunno,\u201d said Madoc.</p><p>Maybe Tynan had consumed some of Madoc\u2019s pain when he\u2019d taken his blood and it had pissed him off. Served the fucker right, if that was the case.</p><p>\u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t killed my camera. That would have been quite a show. You sure you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Madoc ignored the question. \u201cYou got any of those cameras in Paul\u2019s suite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go see the girl if you\u2019re that worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer sister won\u2019t let me.\u201d It sounded like a lame excuse to him. Since when did he let a woman boss him around?</p><p>Probably since she was right. He had no business around Nika. If she\u2019d been his lady, it would be different, but she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Madoc looked at his ring for the millionth time, just to be sure he hadn\u2019t missed anything. The colors were still the same. Muted, faded, nearly motionless. Dying.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019re compatible?\u201d asked Nicholas in a reverent tone.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Madoc pushed himself to his feet, using the wall to steady himself. The dizziness eased, but not much. He needed liquids and plenty of them if he was going to refill what Tynan had taken.</p><p>Nicholas looked at his own ring, which swirled with lots of color. He still had plenty of time, and Madoc resented him for it. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to meet her yet. Joseph has ordered us all to stay away until she\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>If she ever got better. No one seemed to be doing anything to help her, and it pissed Madoc off. \u201cDo you have one of those master keys on you?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas frowned, making the small scars on his face pucker. \u201cAlways. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you expect me to just hand it over?\u201d</p><p>Madoc slammed Nicholas against the wall and held him there by his shoulders. He tried to cover up how unsteady he was\u2014how close he was to puking all over the man\u2019s shoes. \u201cUnless you\u2019d prefer I take it from you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas wasn\u2019t the least bit scared. The fucker. \u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d he asked, totally unconcerned by his position.</p><p>\u201cNone of your fucking business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems a lot of things fall into that category with you.\u201d Nicholas moved quicker than Madoc\u2019s fuzzy head could follow, and a second later Madoc was against the wall face-first. Nicholas had him pinned there, his thick forearm right at the base of Madoc\u2019s skull.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again,\u201d said Nicholas in a patient tone. \u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d</p><p>The urge to fight rose up inside Madoc, screaming for release. The constant pressure inside him pounded at him to let go and tear into Nicholas. It would feel so good to give in and drive his fists into something. Vent some of his rage that Nika wasn\u2019t his and never would be. She couldn\u2019t save him.</p><p>\u201cYou could try it,\u201d whispered Nicholas, apparently knowing what Madoc was thinking. \u201cNormally, I\u2019d say you\u2019d have even odds, but not today. You\u2019re weak. I can feel your legs shaking just holding you up. I\u2019d have you on the ground and bleeding in seconds, and that\u2019s not going to get any of us anywhere. So why don\u2019t we pretend we\u2019re gentlemen and you tell me why you want the key?\u201d</p><p>Madoc\u2019s teeth bit into his lip as his face was mashed harder against the wall. He couldn\u2019t even stop it from happening. Nicholas was right. He was weak. His only choice was to play nice. Not his strong suit. \u201cI just want to be near her in case they need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell makes you think they\u2019d want your help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t. That\u2019s why I need the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you into Paul\u2019s suite where you can go causing more trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want inside Paul\u2019s suite. Just the one next door. I swear.\u201d</p><p>The pressure against Madoc\u2019s neck eased as Nicholas backed away. Madoc turned in time to see him drop a plastic key card on his way down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be watching,\u201d said Nicholas without turning around. \u201cKill another camera and I\u2019ll make you eat it.\u201d</p><p>Andra couldn\u2019t seem to make that magic stuff work anymore. She could feel the invisible strand of power connecting her to Paul, but she couldn\u2019t seem to do anything with it. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t find a way inside Nika\u2019s head. She wanted to help her, get her to wake up, maybe eat again, but nothing she tried worked. Maybe she was just too tired, or maybe Paul needed to be closer to her.</p><p>Maybe she just didn\u2019t have what it took to do the job.</p><p>Her eyes burned and her knees ached\u2014a sure sign she was nearing the end of her strength. Again.</p><p>Andra laid her head on the pillow next to Nika\u2019s and prayed for her weakness to abate. Just for a while.</p><p>The room was quiet, restful. The muted blues and greens reminded her of the ocean on a calm day. There was no clutter in here, just the bare necessities of a bed, bedside table, and dresser. Even though it had the feel of disuse, nothing was dusty or stale.</p><p>Nika was safer here than she\u2019d ever be in Andra\u2019s home. Paul had sworn to her that no Synestryn had ever breached their magical defenses. Even if one of the people here bled, the monsters couldn\u2019t smell it.</p><p>Andra felt the weight of despair flattening her heart, and she tried to remind herself that there was still hope. Tynan was researching a cure. Sibyl might be able to see what they needed to do.</p><p>There was still hope. She just had to be patient, give these people time to work their magic.</p><p>Andra watched the even rise and fall of Nika\u2019s chest. She was calm and still. Peaceful. At least Nika wasn\u2019t suffering. If she had been, patience wouldn\u2019t have been an option.</p><p>Paul rapped his knuckles lightly on the doorframe of the bedroom, making Andra jump. She hadn\u2019t heard him come back, but she was so glad to see him. She wanted to rush into his arms and let him hold her. He was the only person who seemed to make some of her anguish go away, and she really could use a little of that right now.</p><p>She sat up on the bed and saw that his handsome face was lined with concern and something else. Something deeper that worried her.</p><p>Without thinking about it, she poked around in his thoughts, looking for the source. She wasn\u2019t very good at this, and she could catch only bits and pieces, but she saw Joseph\u2019s angry face at the forefront of Paul\u2019s mind.</p><p>She brushed up against a writhing mass of aching emotion and recognized it for what it was. Guilt. She\u2019d felt it herself too often not to know it instantly. He felt like he\u2019d made some kind of mistake\u2014one that couldn\u2019t be erased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A gentle pressure filled her head as he pushed her out of his mind. \u201cNone of that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re suffering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. I brought help.\u201d</p><p>A young woman stepped out from behind him. She had thick, curly black hair and sad brown eyes despite the tentative smile on her face. She came up to Paul\u2019s chin, but the way she curled in on herself made her seem smaller. Younger.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t raise her eyes to look at Andra, as if it would somehow be disrespectful. \u201cMy lady,\u201d she greeted her with an awkward curtsy.</p><p>Lady? There it was again. Andra looked at Paul in question.</p><p>\u201cI promise you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Not likely. \u201cCall me Andra. Anything else just confuses me.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded, but still didn\u2019t look up. \u201cI\u2019m Grace. I was told you might need some help caring for your sister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, but we\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, Andra,\u201d said Paul. \u201cYou need a break, and Grace here knows what she\u2019s doing. Let her help.\u201d</p><p>Andra didn\u2019t want any help. Nika was her responsibility. \u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><p>Grace flushed a deep, humiliated red. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, sorry for overstepping my bounds. I seem to be doing that a lot lately. I won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d She turned to leave, but Paul was faster and caught her arm.</p><p>Grace flinched as if she\u2019d been slapped, and cowered, covering her head with her arms. It was a knee-jerk reaction. One she\u2019d gotten used to making, apparently.</p><p>Someone had hurt Grace. Often.</p> <p>Paul\u2019s jaw clenched as he saw Grace\u2019s reaction for what it was, but it didn\u2019t seem to surprise him. He loosened his grip and pretended Grace hadn\u2019t thought he was going to hurt her.</p><p>Grace recovered and forced her body to straighten. Her cheeks darkened further with embarrassment and she glued her eyes to the floor.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay, Grace,\u201d said Paul in a gentle, soft voice.</p><p>Seeing his long fingers wrapped around another woman made Andra\u2019s stomach turn. It didn\u2019t matter that it was just her arm. He might as well have been feeling her up, the way it made Andra burn with jealousy.</p><p>Before she realized what she was doing, Andra was off the bed, her fists clenched.</p><p>Paul\u2019s mouth curved with a knowing grin. He looked at Andra with his brows raised. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p> <p>Grace tugged against Paul\u2019s grip. \u201cI really should go. I\u2019m sorry to have disturbed you, my lady.\u201d The poor thing was nearly beside herself with embarrassment. It wasn\u2019t her fault Paul was fondling her.</p><p>\u201cLet go of her, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you agree to let her help. She knows how to care for Nika. Don\u2019t you, Grace?\u201d</p><p>Grace gave a shaky nod. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Andra how you know so she\u2019ll relax and let you help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother was comatose for two years before she died. We couldn\u2019t afford a hospital, so I cared for her.\u201d The way her voice broke, Andra was sure that the death had been recent.</p><p>All the residual jealousy burning inside Andra evaporated. Grace had lost her mother, too. That tied them together somehow. Made them sisters.</p><p>Grace would need a distraction\u2014something to keep her occupied. Someone to talk to. \u201cLet her go, Paul. She can stay.\u201d</p><p>Paul released her, and Grace stood still, vibrating with tension as if unsure what to do next.</p><p>Andra took pity on her. \u201cCome here and meet my sister, Nika.\u201d</p><p>Paul slipped out of the room.</p><p>Grace stepped forward tentatively. She looked down at Nika, and the look of compassion that filled her eyes with tears told Andra that her sister would be safe with this woman. Grace would not allow her to come to harm. \u201cHow long has she been like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long. She\u2019s always been too thin, but it got worse this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have a feeding tube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She didn\u2019t want one.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get some fluids in her. When was the last time she was changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she wearing a diaper?\u201d</p><p>Andra hadn\u2019t even thought about that. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I can take care of it. I brought some absorbent pads along, as well as extra sheets. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>Paul came back toting a large box. He set it on the dresser. \u201cAre you going to need anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to put in an order for some diapers, but Torr\u2019s supplies will work until then.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>Grace patted Nika\u2019s hand as if telling her everything would be okay. It was such a natural, unconscious gesture for her, Andra didn\u2019t even think she knew she was doing it. Maybe that was how she\u2019d been with her mother.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the same,\u201d said Grace.</p><p>\u201cI should go see him.\u201d Paul\u2019s voice was heavy with grief, making Andra wonder who Torr was.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d Grace blushed and looked at the floor. \u201cI mean, I think it would be better if you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure he could stand seeing you . . . like that.\u201d She motioned to her neck and pointed at the pale band of skin around his throat\u2014where his luceria had hung before Andra had taken it from him.</p><p>\u201cI understand. Will you give him my best when you see him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I will. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re with us, Grace. You\u2019ve taken such good care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019d agree.\u201d</p><p>Paul gave her a sad smile. \u201cHe\u2019s a proud man.\u201d</p><p>Andra peered into the box and saw sheets, some extra pillows, and cans of hospital-grade meal-replacement shakes. Maybe Grace did know what she was doing. She\u2019d certainly thought this through better than Andra had.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man. I pray the Sanguinar will find a way to help him,\u201d said Grace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they will,\u201d said Paul, but he didn\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>Grace\u2019s face lit with hope.</p><p>Paul came up behind Andra. She could feel the heat of his body reaching out to her, drawing her in. \u201cIt\u2019s time for your ceremony, Andra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to stay and help.\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head, keeping her eyes down. \u201cIt\u2019s best if you don\u2019t, my lady. When she\u2019s better, she\u2019ll be glad it was a stranger caring for her needs rather than you. It\u2019s less embarrassing that way.\u201d</p><p>Andra didn\u2019t care about that. She\u2019d do whatever needed to be done to take care of Nika.</p><p>\u201cGrace is right,\u201d said Paul. \u201cAnd all the men are waiting. It won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>Andra looked at Grace\u2019s sweet face. She was already sorting through the things in the box, her movements confident and sure. She knew what she was doing better than Andra did.</p><p>Paul looped his arm around her shoulders. \u201cIt will be fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Andra gave in. Taking a few minutes away, where she could think straight, was probably going to do Nika more good than if Andra stayed and made a mess of things. Besides, ceremonies were boring. She\u2019d have plenty of time to think while they droned on about whatever formal garbage interested them. Maybe she\u2019d even catch a quick nap.</p><p>As soon as they reached the large auditorium-like room and Andra stood face-to-face with dozens of large, intense-looking men, she knew napping wasn\u2019t in her immediate future. Every pair of eyes was on her\u2014or more accurately, on her neck.</p><p>Her hand went to her throat in a nervous gesture. \u201cAre these guys vampires?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Theronai. Like us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they looking at me like they\u2019re really hungry and I\u2019m a filet mignon?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his voice and leaned close to her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly edible, but they\u2019re staring because they\u2019re all hoping that you might be compatible with them the way you are with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I bond with more than one of you?\u201d</p><p>Paul hesitated and she felt a surge of fear clog their connection. \u201cOne at a time,\u201d he said, sounding like uttering the words had cost him dearly.</p><p>Andra slanted him a sideways glance, but his face was a stoic mask. He led her up to a raised platform, and one by one the men started taking off their shirts and lining up at the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she whispered to Paul, hoping to lighten his odd mood, \u201cI\u2019ve had some dreams that started out just like this.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow and nodded to the first man in line. \u201cYeah? I bet none of them have ended like this will, though.\u201d</p><p>The first man had a not-so-handsome face that was crisscrossed with thin scars, but she hardly noticed past his laser blue eyes. He walked up to her, knelt at her feet, sliced his chest open with his sword, and in a deep, solemn voice, said, \u201cMy life for yours, my lady.\u201d</p><p>A warmth curled around her, then solidified into a heaviness that bore down on her shoulders. Paul\u2019s strong arm held her around the waist and kept her steady.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Nicholas Laith,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>The man rose, gave her a smile and a wink, and hopped off the platform to make room for the next man.</p><p>Each one of them went through the same routine, and each time, that invisible weight grew heavier. By the time the ceremony was over, Andra could hardly stand. Sweat had formed along her hairline and between her breasts, and she was shaking from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost over,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>The last man came up to her. He\u2019d hung at the back of the room the whole time, watching silently, standing apart from the rest. He had short brown hair and watchful black eyes. When he got close, Andra caught the faint scent of a forest in winter coming off of him\u2014clean and cold. He didn\u2019t remove his shirt, which caused a stirring of whispers among the other men. Instead, he cut through the fabric, cutting deeper than the rest of the men, by the amount of blood he spilled.</p><p>\u201cMy life for yours,\u201d he vowed, refusing to bow his head, but instead looking into her eyes as he gave the words.</p><p>Andra stumbled under the weight, but Paul held her up. The man held out his hand, and the ring he wore was nearly white. Only the faintest trace of sapphire blue swirled beneath the surface.</p><p>Andra felt Paul\u2019s body tense around hers. The man said nothing, but there was a silent air of challenge in his stance.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give her up, Iain,\u201d said Paul. His voice was rough, almost a feral growl of sound.</p><p>Iain was silent, but he lifted Andra\u2019s hand and pressed a hot kiss into her palm. She felt his tongue flick over her skin and quickly pulled her hand from his grasp.</p><p>In the center of her palm was a dark red mark, like the one Paul had placed on her before.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you put a bloodmark on my lady?\u201d demanded Paul. Some primal, instinctive need to kill rose up in Paul, clogging their link with its power. Andra didn\u2019t understand the cause, but she knew what it meant.</p><p>He reached for his sword, but Iain\u2019s was already unsheathed. If she didn\u2019t stop this, it was going to end in bloodshed. Lots of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andra stepped between the men, praying that Iain kept that lethal blade off her skin. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, big boy,\u201d she told Paul. She forced him to look down at her, distracting him from the need to hurt Iain.</p><p>He stared at Iain, breathing hard, his color high. He still wasn\u2019t listening.</p><p>Andra pressed her hands to Paul\u2019s chest, digging her fingers in just enough to get him to listen. \u201cI\u2019m tired. Take me back to your place.\u201d</p><p>That got his attention. He blinked a couple of times and gave her a tight nod.</p> <p>\u201cStay away from my woman,\u201d warned Paul.</p><p>\u201cAs long as she\u2019s yours, I will,\u201d said Iain.</p><p>Andra ignored the possessive comment in favor of averting disaster. She\u2019d talk to Paul later about the fact that she was her own woman, but now, she needed to get him out of here. \u201cPlease, Paul,\u201d she said, letting her fatigue come through in her tone. \u201cI need to lie down.\u201d</p><p>She tugged on him and finally he started to leave. Andra peeked over her shoulder as they exited the room and those watchful black eyes were locked right onto her. There was no warmth inside that man. None at all. If she hadn\u2019t seen his blood for herself, she would have sworn he had ice flowing inside his veins.</p><p>Chapter 22</p> <p>Paul needed to stake his claim\u2014make sure Andra knew that he wasn\u2019t letting her go to another man. Not while he drew breath.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to end with her the way it had with Kate.</p><p>Paul led Andra by the hand, pulling her down the hall faster than was comfortable for her. He forced himself to slow down and take her fatigue into account. It wasn\u2019t her fault that Iain was compatible with her.</p><p>He could feel fine tremors of worry and weariness cascading down her arm. The Theronai inside him demanded that he take action and force her to relax, but the man understood there was little he could do to make that happen, short of making Nika whole again.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d she asked him. \u201cWhy did that guy leave a mark on my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he could find you later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would he need to find me?\u201d</p><p>The last thing he wanted to do was tell her the truth, but he owed her at least that much. \u201cOnce our time together is up, you\u2019ll be free to bond with another man if you want. Iain wants to make sure that he\u2019s able to find you when that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to be attached to anyone for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be able to tell you that it\u2019s your choice, but times are desperate. Iain will do anything in his power to convince you to be with him.\u201d He paused, debating whether or not to tell her the rest. In the end, he couldn\u2019t hold back. \u201cSo will I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have some time before I have to think about that. Right now, I\u2019ve got enough to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you need to get some rest. You\u2019re exhausted, and that ceremony couldn\u2019t have been easy on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we go outside and get some fresh air first? I just want to feel normal again for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Whatever you want.\u201d</p> <p>Andra nodded and followed behind him through his suite and out the sliding glass door. It was already hot, and the air was warm and heavy with humidity. The grounds were well tended, and flowers bloomed nearby, making the air smell sweet. There were no unnatural noises\u2014no traffic, no flight patterns above to ruin the solitude of their home.</p><p>Paul pulled in a deep breath and tried to convey a sense of peace to Andra through their link.</p><p>She clutched at his hand and wrapped her free hand around his wrist, as if worried he\u2019d try to pull away. He could feel the soft press of her breasts above his elbow, feel the rapid beat of her heart, subtle but strong against his skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice out here,\u201d she said. \u201cPrivate.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never enjoyed it so much as he did now, with her. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be welcome at Dabyr. No matter what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Nika will like it here when she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>Not if, but when. At least Andra hadn\u2019t lost her sense of hope. That was good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she will.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against his shoulder and Paul wanted to shout with joy. Not only was she touching him, but she was looking to him for comfort. Needing him, if only a little.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let her down, so he looped his arm around her and hugged her close. He stroked her arm and let out a deep, satisfied breath, letting her feel his sense of satisfaction and utter rightness. If he never got anything more from her, this gift of trust she offered would always be with him to ease him in his final days.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of peace about this place, isn\u2019t there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere is. The Gerai make it a beautiful home for us. And it\u2019s safe here. Nothing can harm you here with so many Sentinels around.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. Her eyes were bloodshot. It was a sure sign she\u2019d been using his power, straining herself. He hadn\u2019t felt the tug of energy leave his body, so she must not have been using very much. Then again, their conduit was still too new, so she could get only a trickle out of him.</p><p>Maybe the trust she was showing him now by letting him see her weak would help that change. He could hope.</p><p>\u201cWhen Nika is better, you\u2019ll let her stay here, won\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. We want both of you to stay.\u201d</p><p>She looked away then, but didn\u2019t pull away. She stayed pressed up against his body, letting him hold her. \u201cI\u2019ll come visit, but I can\u2019t live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to work. I can\u2019t let any more children end up like my sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll work together. We got Sammy back, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>He felt something rising up inside her\u2014something that scared her and had done so for so long she didn\u2019t even notice it anymore. He tried to figure it out, but she blocked him, shutting him out. Paul didn\u2019t even think she realized what she was doing. It was like she was so used to hiding this facet of herself that she didn\u2019t even need to try.</p><p>\u201cAre you poking around up there again?\u201d she asked. Her fingers slid up his chest and toyed with the collar of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee anything interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. Everything about you intrigues me.\u201d</p><p>He felt her soften against him a little, lean a little harder against him, trusting him to hold her steady. Paul closed his eyes and reveled in her trust, as small as it was.</p><p>\u201cWho is Torr?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe man Grace was talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Theronai. One of our strongest, most capable fighters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s chest tightened with grief. \u201cHe was injured the night we found Grace and her brother and rescued them from the Synestryn.\u201d</p><p>Andra patted his arm, soothing him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was poisoned by a Synestryn we\u2019ve never seen before. None of the Sanguinar know how to cure him, and he\u2019s been paralyzed from the neck down ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor man,\u201d breathed Andra. \u201cI wish there was something we could do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Grace want you to go see him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Paul\u2019s arms tightened around Andra. She was more precious than she realized in so many ways. \u201cI\u2019ve found you. Seeing that is only going to make things harder for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s trapped. He can\u2019t go out and look for a woman like you for himself. Unless the Sanguinar find a way to heal him, he\u2019s going to be stuck here, dependent on the care of others until he dies. He\u2019s a proud man. That must be a kind of living hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the Sanguinar will figure out how to help him like they will with Nika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Hope was a powerful thing, but it was in damn short supply right now.</p><p>She turned in his embrace until she was facing him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think they can help him, do you?\u201d</p><p>Paul sighed. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying for weeks now with no success. Even with all the blood donations they\u2019ve been getting, they just aren\u2019t powerful enough to fix everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce they fix Nika, I\u2019ll give Tynan my blood for him.\u201d</p><p>She was so generous, so strong, so beautiful. He couldn\u2019t help but love her.</p><p>Paul wasn\u2019t sure she could handle any heartfelt confessions right now, so he kept his feelings to himself. If she bothered to look, she\u2019d see how he felt about her.</p><p>He cupped her cheek, reveling in the smoothness of her skin. \u201cThat would be good. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>Paul watched her mouth move and wished like hell he was kissing her.</p><p>\u201cYour job is dangerous,\u201d she said. Her fingers slid up into his hair and she tugged his head down close to hers. \u201cIf anything . . . bad ever happened to you, I\u2019d want someone to call me so I could come back and help you, too.\u201d</p><p>She was already talking about leaving as if it were a foregone conclusion. She wasn\u2019t even thinking about staying.</p><p>Make her stay. . . . Tie her to you.</p><p>It was Joseph\u2019s order and exactly what Paul wanted. He wanted her tied to him so tightly she wouldn\u2019t be able to tell where she stopped and he started.</p><p>But what about what she wanted?</p><p>Make her want it.</p><p>He could do it. He just wasn\u2019t sure he should. His people needed her, but it wasn\u2019t his right to force her to do anything. Was it?</p><p>Paul closed his eyes to block out the sight of her. She was too tempting to his senses. Even with his eyes closed he could still smell her skin, warmed by the night air. His own body heated in response and he felt a fine sweat bead up along his brow.</p><p>He\u2019d never do anything to hurt her. Not even for his brothers. But what was the harm in using his abilities to convince her she wanted to stay? Nika would be here, so she could be close to her sister. She\u2019d be safer here than she would back in Omaha. He had plenty of money at his disposal, so he could give her material things, too. Not that those seemed to be important to her, but she might enjoy them. She\u2019d be surrounded by friends, always cared for. Always loved.</p><p>\u201cPaul? You okay?\u201d</p><p>She sounded worried, but Paul couldn\u2019t bring himself to speak. This decision was too important and he was hovering on the edge.</p><p>Her fingers settled against his jaw. He hadn\u2019t shaved today and he was probably poking her skin with his beard. She didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>He wondered if she\u2019d mind his beard rasping against her breasts and belly as he kissed her. Maybe the inside of her thighs.</p><p>She shivered in his arms and let out a little moan of need.</p><p>He realized then that she\u2019d slid into his thoughts, trying to figure out what was wrong when he didn\u2019t answer her. She\u2019d seen the images that danced in his head\u2014 images of her laid out naked before him, flushed and rosy from his mouth.</p><p>Paul stood as still as a Sentinel stone. If he so much as flinched, she might run the other way. He wanted her too much, and in a way she could hardly begin to understand, based on her human upbringing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She snuggled her hips against his and he was sure she was able to feel what she did to him. How hard he was for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But I\u2019m not. At least not yet.\u201d She kissed the corner of his mouth and Paul had to hold himself back from taking control and kissing her like he really wanted.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s now or never? What if I don\u2019t let you go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She let out a sweet, feminine laugh. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ll just have to see how that works for you. For now, I\u2019m yours.\u201d She ran her hands down his back until she was cupping his ass. \u201cAnd you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d He lifted her face and kissed her, trying to tell her without words how much she meant to him and his people. How precious she was. How much he loved her.</p><p>His ring buzzed happily, warming his finger.</p><p>Andra melted into him and opened her mouth under his. Her wicked little tongue dancing against his sent a shock of pleasure down his spine. He groaned into her mouth and tilted her head back so he could kiss her deeper.</p> <p>All that lust that Tynan had planted in him as a joke came roaring back to life. His blood felt as if it were on fire and his heart pounded hard enough that he was sure they could hear it all the way in the dining hall. Paul tried to stay in control, but it was a futile effort\u2014a battle lost before it even began.</p><p>He picked her up and carried her inside to his bedroom before he lost his mind and took her out here, where anyone could pass by. For now, she was his and only his, and he didn\u2019t want anyone else seeing her naked.</p><p>And she was definitely going to be naked as soon as he could manage it.</p><p>Andra pulled her mouth away from his just as he cleared the bedroom door. \u201cNot here. Grace will hear us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen block the sound. Put up a barrier to keep it from leaving the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that?\u201d</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t want to talk or teach her anything right now. He wanted to take her and make her come so hard so many times she\u2019d never be able to live without him. \u201cYes,\u201d he said between clenched teeth.</p><p>Paul set her on the bed and felt a tug of power as it left his body. The air around them shifted and his ears popped as she put the barrier in place.</p><p>He pushed her back onto the mattress and covered her with his body so she couldn\u2019t get away. A dark grin pulled at his mouth. \u201cNow you can be as loud as you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you can make me scream?\u201d It was a challenge. One Paul was more than ready to accept.</p><p>Actions spoke louder than words, so instead of answering her, he simply bundled up all the searing lust writhing inside him and shoved it through their link. The conduit connecting them trembled at the force of his need for her.</p><p>So did Andra.</p> <p>She arched up off the bed and sucked in a gasping breath. Her eyes widened in shock and her fingernails dug into his arms hard enough to leave marks.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d Her voice was rough with unsated lust, but not for long.</p><p>Paul couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her. He loved seeing her this way, nearly helpless in her need, knowing he was the only man who could ease her and give her what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cNo one else can ever make you feel like this,\u201d he growled at her. \u201cOnly me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. Please.\u201d</p><p>Paul straddled her hips and slipped his fingers under the hem of her shirt, rubbing his knuckles across her stomach. She was soft and smooth and he\u2019d never get enough of touching her, not if he lived forever. \u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>Her low groan was his only response.</p><p>\u201cStay still and I\u2019ll give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him in question. Her blue eyes were dark with desire. Her mouth was already puffy from his kisses. By the time he was finished, it would be a lot more so.</p><p>Andra reached for him, but he captured her hand and placed it on the pillow by her head. \u201cDon\u2019t move or I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her understanding and Paul slid another wave of lust through their link. It flowed easier this time, hardly taking him any effort at all to make her gasp and writhe beneath him.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>Paul unbuckled his sword belt and propped it against the nightstand so it was still within easy reach. Now that it was out of the way, he could move more easily without fear of scratching her. He scooted down her legs enough that he could unbutton her jeans. He slid the zipper down and peeled back the denim. Her dainty pink panties made his stomach clench with desire.</p><p>Andra whimpered as if she\u2019d felt it, too. Maybe she had. She wasn\u2019t blocking him out. She was open and receptive to him, soaking up everything he gave her.</p><p>She reached for him, but Paul said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I\u2019m not finished yet.\u201d</p><p>Her arm fell back to her side, but her fist was clenched in frustration. Her eyes warned him of retribution, but he didn\u2019t care. He could hardly wait to see what she\u2019d come up with.</p><p>Paul bent down and blew a puff of air over her belly button. Andra sighed and her stomach tightened, showing off the muscles in her abs. So pretty. His fingers barely brushed her skin, just stirring the fine hair.</p><p>She shuddered and her breathing sped up. A warm flush spread down her body, and Paul had to strip her bare and see just how far it went.</p><p>He took his time getting her undressed, kissing each new patch of skin as it was revealed. By the time he was through, they were both sweating and shaking with arousal. He could smell the scent of her need and it served only to heighten his own. He wasn\u2019t sure how much more he could stand.</p><p>As much as he\u2019d wanted to tease her, going so slowly had done the same for him. He enjoyed every kiss, every swipe of his tongue over her flesh, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Not nearly. He wanted to be inside her sweet body as deeply as he was inside her mind. Filling her up so there was no room for any other man but him.</p><p>He stripped himself while she watched.</p><p>His ring was hot with the demands he was putting on the luceria. Their connection was still too new and fragile for the amount of power flowing between them, and yet he couldn\u2019t stop. He needed to push her more\u2014tie them together more tightly with his power.</p><p>Make her stay.</p><p>The skin beneath her necklace was bright red. He ran his finger across the slippery band and it was hot and seething with rich plumes of sapphire blue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d she breathed, clenching the sheets in her fist.</p><p>Paul covered her body with his and nudged her thighs wide so there was room for him between them. She arched up, trying to merge them together, but he evaded her and pinned her to the bed, holding her there with his weight. His erection throbbed with need, spilling liquid drops against her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want it,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>His fierce little warrior glared at him in frustration, which only made him that much harder. \u201cYou know I do, damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other man could ever make you feel this way\u2014make you want it the way I do. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d He sent an image into her, along with his words. He showed her how pretty she looked when she came around his cock, reminded her how good it felt when she did.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes. More.\u201d</p><p>In the end, he could deny her nothing. Whatever he had to give, it was hers. So he slid inside her, relishing the slick heat of her body yielding to his. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes, which had darkened with passion until they were the same sapphire blue as the luceria. When she reached for him this time, he didn\u2019t stop her. Her fingers brushed over his brow and down his cheeks until they settled as light as butterflies on his jaw.</p><p>Her body tightened around his erection, making him suck in a hissing breath. At the same time, he felt her use their link to push back some of the desire she was feeling for him, the way he\u2019d done to her.</p><p>Her need was softer, less jagged and harsh than his own, but no less demanding. He let it fill him up and swell inside him, warming all the dark places that had stood empty and cold for so long. He\u2019d never really known how lonely he\u2019d been until now\u2014until she\u2019d swept it all away and made him whole.</p><p>\u201cI get it now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGet what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntimacy. The two of us together, like this, sharing the same space. It has a kind of magic to it.\u201d</p><p>That made him smile. \u201cIt does. Want to see another trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I can hardly wait.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t make her. He lowered his mouth and fit it perfectly to hers. She tasted of hope and silent wishes, and he couldn\u2019t get enough of her.</p><p>His hand glided along her flank, soaking up her heat while he slid inside her mind and let it merge completely with his own. She didn\u2019t resist. In fact, she welcomed him with a soft sigh of surrender.</p><p>Instantly, Paul\u2019s perceptions shifted until he could see what she saw, feel what she felt.</p><p>Through her mind, he saw himself as he hovered above her. His face was rigid with the strain of self-control. Muscles in his chest and arms bulged and the veins throbbed with his lust-heated blood. His lifemark was in full bloom, bright green with the merest hint of baby leaves just beginning to form. His hair was a mess, but she found it charming. Her skin was hot and so sensitive to his touch she could feel the minute ridges of his fingerprints rasping against her flesh. Her breasts ached for the wet heat of his mouth and the slippery glide of his tongue. The walls of her sex stretched to accept him, and yet she hadn\u2019t once complained.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she breathed. \u201cThat is . . . Wow.\u201d</p><p>So she was feeling him as well, which meant she could feel that there was nothing gentle about his need. It clawed at him to thrust hard and deep, to take her and come inside her.</p><p>Her tone was high and desperate. \u201cYou really need to move now.\u201d</p><p>Paul moved. He slid out of her and back, letting his body move to please her most. He bent so he could kiss her breasts and love her nipples with his tongue and teeth. Andra clenched around him, and he could already feel her drawing near a climax. She responded to him so fast it humbled him. He\u2019d never had a lover as responsive as she was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare think about another woman right now,\u201d she warned him. Jealousy surged through her, making her words come out in a fierce snarl. Her nails dug into his scalp and sent streamers of sensation rioting along his spine.</p><p>At this rate, he wasn\u2019t going to last long, either. Not that he minded. She was right there with him, showing him what she needed, and he was more than willing to give it to her. Whatever she wanted.</p><p>He pushed her to the edge and held her hovering there, driving deep inside her with each powerful thrust of his hips. He knew just when to pull back to keep her on the brink, quieting her with soft strokes of his hand. Finally, after the third time he\u2019d done it, she grabbed his shoulders and used a surge of magically enhanced power to flip him over until she was straddling him.</p><p>Her head fell back on a sigh of pleasure as she sank down on his erection. Her breasts were red from his stubble, and her nipples were puckered and distended from his mouth. Her ribs expanded with every heavy breath she took, and sweat gleamed on her flushed skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andra braced her hands on his chest and rocked her hips. The branches of his lifemark swayed in response to her touch, arching toward her splayed fingers.</p><p>Paul felt a zing of sensation every time she ground herself against him just the right way. Whether it was hers or his, he couldn\u2019t tell. It didn\u2019t matter anymore. All the sensations they felt, they shared, and he could no longer separate them. She squeezed him tight and now he was the one on the edge, gritting his teeth to hold back his climax just a little longer.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work. She sped her pace and it sent her flying into her orgasm headfirst. Paul was right there with her. His body tensed and he let out a rough shout of completion as the first wave of release crashed against him. Andra\u2019s voice rose along with his, echoing off the barrier she\u2019d created around the two of them.</p><p>Paul pulled her close and kissed her open mouth as he came inside her. His vision faded, but he didn\u2019t care. He had the feel of her against his body and in his mind, the sound of her voice singing in his ears, the taste of her on his tongue, and the scent of her in his lungs. And still, it wasn\u2019t enough to sate him. He\u2019d never get enough of her.</p> <p>Their bodies quieted until only small quivers of their climax remained. She was draped limply over his chest, breathing hard. Paul gathered her limbs and rolled her over, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave her body. Not yet.</p><p>He arranged her arms until she looked comfortable. By the time he was finished, she was pulling away from him, seeping out of his mind so that the space felt empty and darker somehow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d want your space now that we\u2019re done,\u201d she said.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t get it. \u201cThis is the way it\u2019s supposed to be between us. Not just during sex, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can handle having you in my head all the time. It\u2019s a little crowded up there.\u201d</p><p>The comment hurt his feelings, but he tried not to let it show. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel crowded to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re used to all of this.\u201d She pushed against his chest and he took the not-so-subtle hint that she wanted him to move away.</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t budge. He liked being inside her too much. In fact, he could probably go another couple of rounds before he wore himself out enough to stop. Just looking at her, knowing that flush over her skin was his doing, made him hard. \u201cYou\u2019d get used to it, too, if you\u2019d let yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you almost a week. What more do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lifetime,\u201d he shot back at her. \u201cSeveral, actually.\u201d</p> <p>She frowned as if she hadn\u2019t understood what he said, but then he saw her eyes widen in shock as she realized he was speaking literally. She prodded at his mind, seeking the truth; then she pulled out completely and a thick wall slammed down between them.</p><p>Shit. He\u2019d lost her. Scared her off.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. You\u2019re mine, and I\u2019m keeping you.\u201d To emphasize his point, he ground his hips against hers, making her feel every inch of him still hot and hard within her.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut and she bit her lip to hold back a soft sound of pleasure. He heard it anyway.</p><p>\u201cStop. Please. This is too much.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t nearly enough. The need to possess her was raging inside of him. He had to find a way to keep her forever. Three days were never going to be enough. Hell, forever might not be, either.</p><p>Make her stay.</p> <p>It was an order, given to him by their chosen leader. Defying that was the same thing as betraying his people. He had to make her stay.</p><p>That brilliant, glowing pool of power inside him swelled in response. He\u2019d never been able to access it before Andra, but now that he was connected to her, he could use their link to draw upon that power and channel it through her for short periods of time. He could use it to do his will. To make Andra do the same.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked in a weak, frightened voice.</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he called to his power and felt the seething waves of it rise to do his bidding. He channeled a thick column of it toward their link.</p><p>\u201cPaul,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou can\u2019t. I can\u2019t take that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. You will.\u201d That didn\u2019t sound like him. There was a dark, discordant note in his words, as if there were another voice speaking along with him, harsh and out of harmony.</p><p>The closer the column of glowing energy got to their link, the more it looked as though he were trying to channel a waterfall through a drinking straw. Maybe she was right. Maybe it was too much.</p><p>But it felt so good. He was close to something important\u2014some kind of breakthrough that would change his life.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Andra\u2019s voice sounded faint and far away.</p><p>\u201cJust relax,\u201d he said in that jumbled voice. \u201cIt will be easier on you.\u201d</p><p>The first drops of energy hit their link. Power sling-shot from him, through her, back into him. The feeling was amazing. Sparks dribbled from his fingertips and slid over Andra\u2019s skin, leaving angry red streaks behind.</p><p>He\u2019d heal her later, when it was over and she belonged to him forever.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>He paused. Something here wasn\u2019t right. He just couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.</p><p>\u201cPaul!\u201d His name was a shout of pain.</p><p>He was hurting Andra. Killing her with his need for her to stay by his side. He loved her and he was killing her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do it. He had to stop.</p><p>That massive column of power plummeted back into the glowing ocean inside him. Searing agony streaked out through his limbs, but he gritted his teeth and took it. His body locked up against the pain.</p><p>\u201cYou need to breathe, damn it,\u201d he heard Andra say. She was so far away.</p><p>His lungs were crushed under a wave of pressure. There was no room to breathe.</p><p>Then her mouth was on his, kissing him, filling him up with air. He wished he could see her. She was so beautiful. He wanted to see her again before he died.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die unless I\u2019m the one doing the killing.\u201d Another breath filled him.</p><p>Andra pulled at his power, though he had no idea what she was doing with it. Whatever it was, it felt good. Cool. Clean. Just like her.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>That thought ricocheted around in his head so loudly he was sure she\u2019d heard it. He was just as sure she wasn\u2019t going to like it.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Andra pulled back in shock at the possessiveness inside him. He wasn\u2019t just playing at the caveman attitude. He really meant it. As in forever, which for him was a really long time.</p><p>She had no idea why he would want to be stuck with one person for so long, much less someone who failed as often as she did. He had to have suffered some kind of brain damage at some point. That was the only explanation she could think of.</p><p>He\u2019d seen inside her. He knew how horribly she\u2019d failed her family when it meant the most that she succeed. He\u2019d seen the repercussions of her failure in every one of Nika\u2019s terrified delusions.</p><p>Nika was dying because Andra had failed, and yet Paul still wanted her. Didn\u2019t he know she would only end up getting him killed, too?</p><p>He was sleeping now. She could feel the restful waves drifting out of him. They calmed her frantic need to run away enough to allow her to stay by his side.</p><p>Andra smoothed his messy hair away from his face. He was such a sexy man, so handsome in a rough sort of way, with just enough bad boy in him to make her panties perpetually wet. He was a walking fantasy. His thick, demanding erection was just an added bonus.</p><p>He\u2019d come, but was still hard. For her. She\u2019d seen that clearly enough to know the truth. He wasn\u2019t closing his eyes and thinking of someone else when he took her. He wanted only her.</p><p>Part of her glowed with the knowledge, but the rest of her was wondering how he could feel that way when he knew just how flawed she really was.</p><p>Maybe it didn\u2019t matter what a coward she could be so long as he liked her body. Yeah, that was probably it. Made perfect sense.</p><p>And hurt like hell.</p><p>Andra scrubbed her face with her hands. She\u2019d been so confused since she\u2019d met him. Everything had been turned upside down and she was always one step behind, frantically trying to catch up and figure out what was going on.</p><p>If it helped Nika, it would all be worth it. She\u2019d go on her way, and maybe when she came back to visit her sister, she could see Paul, too.</p><p>That would be nice. She didn\u2019t want to belong to him or tie him down, but she didn\u2019t want to never see him again, either. They could date when things weren\u2019t so crazy and maybe get to know each other like normal people. Or, at least as normal as people like them could ever be.</p><p>She would enjoy getting used to having a big, sexy, sword-wielding warrior with a nonstop erection around. What girl wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>It could work. They might even end up close enough that she\u2019d be willing to give that forever thing a shot\u2014once she was sure he knew she wasn\u2019t the dependable sort. As long as he got rid of his delusions about her, she\u2019d be willing to try. Chances were it wouldn\u2019t work, but they sure would have fun giving it a try.</p><p>Madoc pressed his cheek to the bare wall, wishing he could slide through the faded paint. He knew the walls of the suites at Dabyr were insulated against noise, and there was no way he could hear Nika\u2019s heart beating. But he could feel it. Just on the other side of the wall. Faint, but steady. She was still alive.</p><p>Pain racked his body, but even so, some of the brittleness in his bones bled away as he pressed himself as close as he could get to her.</p><p>The suite next to Paul\u2019s\u2014the one Madoc was in\u2014was empty. No one would be coming by. Nicholas\u2019s electronic eyes couldn\u2019t see him in here. It was just him and the steady beat of Nika\u2019s heart. Alone together.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why he was here. He had no business being here. He needed to be out there, fighting. Fucking. Blowing off some pressure so he could keep going for just a little longer. Just long enough to know she was going to be okay.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have mattered to him, but apparently enough of his soul was left that it did. He wasn\u2019t sure anymore how much of a good thing that was, but he accepted it\u2014like he accepted the pain pounding through him with every breath.</p><p>As soon as she woke up, he promised himself he\u2019d leave. He\u2019d go and never come back. He wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he could trust himself to stay away from her.</p><p>And if she bonded to one of the men here, he was pretty sure he\u2019d go lethal. It was best to leave before that happened. But not until she was better. Not until she was safe.</p><p>Zach wheeled Torr outside where he could watch the sunset. They both needed some fresh air and Zach really needed a sanity check. All of his friends were slipping away. Kevin and Thomas were dead, both in the past few weeks. Drake had Helen now. They were still spending every second together, and as much as he was happy for his buddy, he was so jealous it made his stomach burn. He could hardly stand to look at Drake anymore without wishing for that same kind of happiness so hard he ached down to his bones.</p><p>Lexi was gone. He couldn\u2019t feel her today, though every once in a while\u2014every few days\u2014his bloodmark would suddenly start doing its job again and he\u2019d get a hint as to her direction. It never lasted long enough for him to track her, and every time he got that little ping, it was from a different location. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was always moving. Always running.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even know why she was so afraid of him. She\u2019d never stopped long enough for him to find out.</p><p>Zach parked the wheelchair near a bench along the sidewalk. The grounds here were parklike\u2014perfectly trimmed grass interspersed with beds of flowers and huge, towering trees covered the land. Their new head gardener apparently had a knack for his job. The place had never looked nicer.</p><p>Torr stared straight ahead, not bothering to turn toward Zach even though he could still move his head. The rest of him was paralyzed, and already, the heavy muscles that had powered his body were shrinking and fading away, leaving only a hint of what he once had been. The decay had been so fast, Zach was sure the man wasn\u2019t going to last much longer.</p> <p>\u201cHow you holding up, man?\u201d asked Zach.</p><p>Torr\u2019s amber eyes glowed with anger. \u201cHow do you think? How well would you be holding up if your body was a useless pile of bones and you had a tube up your dick so you didn\u2019t wet yourself?\u201d</p><p>Zach wanted to offer Torr peace, but he had none to spare. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re all fucking sorry. All of us except Joseph. He denied my request again.\u201d Rage vibrated in his tone, and a hint of something else. Something helpless and desperate.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to let you die yet. You haven\u2019t given the Sanguinar enough time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you were sitting here, you\u2019d know that was a lie. Every day in this body is an eternity. It\u2019s time to let it end.\u201d</p><p>Zach clasped Torr\u2019s arm, even though he knew the other man couldn\u2019t feel it. \u201cWe can\u2019t give up on you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo instead, you torture me? How kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you feel if it was me sitting there? Would you give up on me?\u201d</p><p>Torr turned his head then. Torr glared at Zach with so much fury lurking in his eyes that Zach almost had to look away. But he didn\u2019t. He owed his friend more than cheap denial and avoidance.</p><p>\u201cIf you were sitting in this chair, I\u2019d love you enough to slit your throat and watch you die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019d be out there searching for that thing that bit you. You\u2019d be bleeding into the mouth of a leech every other day. You\u2019d be fighting to save my life.\u201d</p><p>Torr looked away and his voice dropped to a quiet, solemn tone. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, but I forgive you.\u201d</p><p>It sounded as if he were saying good-bye, and Zach felt a stab of worry. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die, Torr. We\u2019re going to fix this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better hurry, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you\u2019re going to give up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have. If Joseph won\u2019t kill me, I\u2019ll do the damn job myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to do that? No one is going to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about the women Paul brought here. Grace told me she had to go help because one of them was dying because she couldn\u2019t eat.\u201d</p> <p>Zach put the pieces together. \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve stopped eating. Don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of it before. Guess I just wasn\u2019t thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoseph won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving him a choice. I\u2019m done. Four hundred years is enough for any man.\u201d</p><p>Zach couldn\u2019t let his friend give up like this. He knew Torr was suffering, but if he just held out a little longer, the Sanguinar would figure out something. \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Come with me to find Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Torr gave a humorless laugh. \u201cSure. Why the hell not? Just strap me to the roof of your car and we\u2019ll go on a road trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. Let\u2019s get you out of here for a while. The change of scenery might do you some good.\u201d</p><p>Torr\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s going to do me some good is a sword through my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ve started finding our women again. What if yours is out there, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she is? It\u2019s not going to make a difference now. I\u2019m not going to tie down a female when she might be able to save a man who can actually do some good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re giving up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Try sitting here for a while and you\u2019ll believe it. I\u2019m done, Zach. I\u2019ve had a good run. It\u2019s time to let go. I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up on you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Waste your time. I just don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I want to help you get through this.\u201d</p><p>Torr stared out into the night, but he was seeing something else. \u201cThere is one thing you can do for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth flattened in frustration. \u201cNo. This is something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Grace taking care of me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Isn\u2019t she treating you well? I thought she was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. She\u2019s too nice. Too innocent. She shouldn\u2019t have to see what I\u2019m going to do to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already made up my mind,\u201d said Torr.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m not going to make this easier on you. As far as I\u2019m concerned, Grace is staying.\u201d</p><p>Torr\u2019s face darkened with humiliation. \u201cI don\u2019t want her around, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Zach was beginning to suspect there was more to it than Torr\u2019s concern for her. \u201cYou like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m protecting her, as my vow demands. She\u2019s too soft for her own good.\u201d</p><p>Torr felt something for the woman. Zach was almost sure of it. Almost. \u201cI like \u2019em soft. I could take her off your hands for a while, I guess. Hunting for Lexi has kept me so busy it\u2019s been a long time since I got laid.\u201d</p><p>Torr\u2019s nostrils flared in anger and his voice whipped out like a lash. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking touch her.\u201d</p><p>Zach grinned. \u201cI knew it. You do like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a bastard,\u201d growled Torr. \u201cYou\u2019d better pray I never walk again, because the first thing I\u2019d do is kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Zach crossed his arms over his chest and gave Torr a taunting grin. He hadn\u2019t gotten that sanity check he needed, but he\u2019d found Torr\u2019s reason to live. It was good enough for him.</p><p>Andra was gone when Paul woke up. He reached for her before he remembered what had happened. By the time his hand hit the cool, vacant sheets, he remembered everything he\u2019d done and already knew she wouldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>He got out of bed, wrapped the sheet around his hips, and sought her out. He couldn\u2019t face her right now, not after what he\u2019d almost done, but he had to know she was safe and close by.</p><p>He found Andra in Nika\u2019s room, lying next to her with her back to the door, stroking Nika\u2019s white hair. Soft, comforting words rose from her, but Paul couldn\u2019t hear what they were. Grace was sitting in the corner of the room, knitting or crocheting or something else involving lots of yarn. She hummed to herself as her fingers moved so fast they blurred.</p><p>Grace looked up at him, finally noticing him, and her body tightened as if she were about to jump up. He didn\u2019t know why she was nervous around him, but he held his free hand up and shook his head, telling her to stay where she was.</p><p>He needed a shower and some time to pull himself together and figure out how to fix what he\u2019d done.</p><p>Disgust left a bitter taste at the back of his throat that wouldn\u2019t go away. He\u2019d showered and dressed and still had no clue how to approach Andra with his apology for his lapse in judgment.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t even sure she really knew what he\u2019d been trying to do to her. She knew it hurt, but she might not know why.</p><p>He\u2019d been ready to enslave her. Even the thought made him sick.</p><p>A knock at his door pulled him from his angst. He finished strapping his sword around his hips and went to answer it.</p><p>Cain stood there, filling the doorway with his bulk. His moss green eyes were dull and red, as if he hadn\u2019t slept in days. The scent of combat clung to his skin, and dust coated his clothing. Wherever he\u2019d been, it hadn\u2019t been fun.</p><p>\u201cSibyl sent me,\u201d he said without preamble.</p><p>\u201cDid she accept our request?\u201d</p><p>Cain nodded, but didn\u2019t look pleased. \u201cShe said she\u2019d see you first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not now? The night\u2019s still young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just got back from hunting and we\u2019re exhausted. The child needs her rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Cain rubbed his temples. Weariness hung heavily on his frame, weighing him down. \u201cAsk Angus, but you probably don\u2019t want to know. I\u2019m going to crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d said Paul. \u201cAndra will be relieved to know there\u2019s still hope.\u201d</p><p>Cain looked as if he were going to say something else, but settled on, \u201cDon\u2019t expect any miracles. Sibyl\u2019s been acting a little strange lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSibyl always acts strange.\u201d She was perpetually eight years old and could see the future. That was weird on any scale.</p><p>\u201cMore than normal, I mean. Just cut her some slack, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need her.\u201d</p><p>Cain sighed. \u201cI know. Everyone does. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear this has got to be harder on you than it is on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s like a daughter to me,\u201d said Cain.</p><p>Paul wondered what that must be like\u2014to have a child he could call his own. \u201cThat sounds nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days, yeah.\u201d</p><p>But not today, apparently.</p><p>Cain shoved away from the doorframe. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep. See you around eight tomorrow morning, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Gilda couldn\u2019t stop shaking. Every ounce of strength had been wrung from her when she opened that portal. She couldn\u2019t even hold on to Angus as he carried her back to their suite. Not that he needed the help. His arms were strong and solid around her, holding her easily against his chest as if he hadn\u2019t also spent the last few hours fighting nonstop.</p><p>His gait was a little unsteady from the wound in his left thigh. It wasn\u2019t life threatening, but the urge to mend him was nearly overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he told her, knowing her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine for a few hours. You need to rest.\u201d</p><p>The idea of sleeping made a scream bubble up in her throat. Every time she closed her eyes she saw that . . . abomination. She still wasn\u2019t sure if it was real or if she\u2019d imagined it.</p><p>\u201cIt was real,\u201d growled Angus. His arms tightened a bit around her as if trying to protect her from it even now.</p><p>\u201cI need to get clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bath can wait. You need rest.\u201d</p><p>She could still smell the stench of that thing burning\u2014hear the screams ripping from its tiny lungs.</p><p>God, what had they done? It was just a child.</p><p>\u201cNot a child\u2014a demon. It tried to kill Sibyl. We did what we had to.\u201d</p><p>It had looked so . . . human. How was that possible? Gilda swallowed hard, trying to stave off her tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d killed a child tonight. And tomorrow, she was going to have to hunt for more and kill them, too.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it right now. Later, after you\u2019ve rested, you\u2019ll see things more clearly.\u201d</p><p>They neared their suite and the lock opened for Angus. He nodded to the camera outside their door\u2014a silent thanks to Nicholas, who was undoubtedly the one on the other end.</p><p>\u201cNone of this makes sense,\u201d she told her husband as he set her down on their bed.</p> <p>\u201cOf course not. We\u2019re all too tired to make any sense of it. Let it go tonight. Tomorrow we\u2019ll figure out what needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a bath.\u201d She sounded desperate, but she had to wash the smell of that child\u2019s burning flesh from her hair.</p><p>\u201cOkay, love. I\u2019ll run one for you. Stay put.\u201d</p><p>Gilda couldn\u2019t support her weight enough to stay upright. She slumped onto the pillows and felt tears slide over her temple, soaking into the covers. Her eyes stung and she knew they were probably bloodshot from the amount of power she\u2019d channeled tonight.</p><p>At least Angus wouldn\u2019t know she\u2019d cried. She loved him too much to make him suffer through her tears.</p> <p>The fall of water splashing into the tub filled the quiet and helped block out the echoes of those small screams.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do that again. Not ever. She\u2019d lost too many of her own babies over the centuries to take another from some other mother. Even she was not that cruel.</p><p>The Synestryn had finally won. They\u2019d found a way to protect their progeny from the Sentinels by giving them human faces.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t seen it for herself, she never would have believed it.</p><p>\u201cThe bath is ready,\u201d said Angus. His strong body was outlined by the light from the bathroom. Even after all these centuries, he was still as strong and steady as he\u2019d been when she first met him.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t understand why he loved her. She\u2019d done so many horrible things. Tonight was just one more.</p> <p>\u201cStop it,\u201d said Angus in the tone he used to command the Theronai. \u201cWe did the right thing tonight. I won\u2019t have you killing yourself with guilt.\u201d</p><p>Despite his harsh tone, his fingers were gentle as they undid the row of buttons down the front of her gown. She\u2019d have to burn the gray silk. She\u2019d never be able to wear it again without thinking of what she\u2019d done wearing it tonight.</p><p>Angus stripped her naked, then did the same for himself. His lean body was roped with muscles, and even though he had more gray hair now, more scars, he was still beautiful to her.</p><p>He picked her up again and headed for the bathroom. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou just think about the good things for now. We\u2019re together. We love each other. We\u2019re safe and healthy and surrounded by friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you do that? How can you always see the good in things?\u201d</p><p>He settled them into the big tub together, holding her close so her weak body wouldn\u2019t slip under the water. \u201cBecause I have you. All the rest of the world could fall away and as long as I still had you, I\u2019d count myself lucky.\u201d</p><p>He was too good for her, but she\u2019d always known that. It was only one of her many secrets.</p><p>Maybe it was time to tell him about her betrayal. If anyone was capable of forgiving her, it was Angus.</p> <p>If.</p><p>That was the problem. Without him, she\u2019d be lost. As selfish as it was, she couldn\u2019t risk that. She needed him too much. She\u2019d driven everyone else she loved away.</p><p>Gilda reinforced the door on that secret part of her mind, making sure it was tightly locked and barred so he\u2019d never see\u2014never even suspect it was there. She\u2019d do anything to take back what she\u2019d done, but it was too late for that. She was going to have to live with it\u2014one more mistake to add to the list of unforgivable ones she\u2019d made. There were so many, she wished she\u2019d lose count, but she never did. She remembered every one of them.</p><p>\u201cGood news,\u201d said Paul from the doorway. \u201cSibyl has agreed to see you.\u201d</p><p>Andra closed her eyes and gave a quick prayer of thanks. She kissed Nika\u2019s head and eased off the bed.</p><p>Paul was shirtless, and the sight of all those masculine ridges made her heart pound. It didn\u2019t matter that she\u2019d had him only a few hours ago. She wanted more. She probably always would.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she can help?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>Grace had been knitting in the corner of the room for hours, but her needles stopped then. She kept her eyes lowered when she spoke. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about some of the things Sibyl knows. She\u2019s amazing, my lady. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be able to help Nika.\u201d</p><p>Andra wanted to hug Grace for being so sweet. She might be timid and shy, but she wasn\u2019t going to let it get in the way of lending someone else comfort. \u201cThank you, Grace.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and her needles started moving again, though not as smoothly as before.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a walk,\u201d said Paul, obviously wanting to talk to her. \u201cGrace can hold down the fort, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded and followed him outside. Dawn was just starting to make the faintest glow against the eastern horizon. The rest of the sky was filled with stars.</p><p>Paul was oddly quiet, almost somber. And he wasn\u2019t touching her, which wasn\u2019t like him at all.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked like he didn\u2019t want to talk. His jaw was bunched, but he finally gave up the fight. \u201cYeah. I shouldn\u2019t have done what I did to you last night. It was inexcusable.\u201d</p><p>Andra frowned at him, at a total loss. She even tried to peek into his mind to figure out what he meant, but all she met was a solid wall. He wasn\u2019t letting her in and it made her feel . . . lonely. She\u2019d gotten used to sharing thoughts with him and realized how much she was going to miss that when she left. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have had sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not that. I\u2019m talking about what happened after.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d hurt her. \u201cForget about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? I tried to take away your free will last night. I tried to enslave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it hurt like hell, so don\u2019t ever try it again or I\u2019ll have to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to a stop under a huge maple tree. The feel of his hand on her arm warmed her from the inside out. She liked him touching her way too much for her own good.</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d said Paul. \u201cI violated you. I tried to do to you the very thing that I kill others for doing.\u201d</p><p>He really was making a bigger deal out of this than it was. \u201cListen, I knew you wouldn\u2019t do it. You\u2019re not like that. You don\u2019t have it in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been poking around in your head for a couple of days now. You\u2019re a good guy. You just lost your head for a minute. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>His mouth was hanging open in shock. Andra smiled and gave him a quick kiss.</p><p>At least, she\u2019d intended it to be quick. Instead, he grabbed her arms and held on to her, kissing her back with a desperation so strong it startled her.</p><p>When he finally let her come back up for air, she was dizzy and clung to his wide shoulders. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor being the perfect woman.\u201d</p><p>Andra snorted. \u201cI think you need some more sleep. You\u2019re not thinking straight.\u201d</p><p>He knelt at her feet and clasped her hands tightly in his. She could feel the calluses his sword had worn into his skin and they were oddly comforting to her. He was a warrior, capable of keeping her and Nika safe.</p><p>If she stayed.</p><p>Her resolve to leave wavered. She didn\u2019t have much out there waiting for her. He was right that she could do her job from wherever she was. And he would help her. She was sure of it. He\u2019d never leave a child alone and afraid.</p><p>Paul pressed his palm flat on the earth and she felt that same kind of humming she\u2019d felt earlier tonight. Only this time it didn\u2019t hurt. The power flowed through her easily in a gentle trickle that warmed her skin.</p><p>The ground beneath them trembled. Paul lifted his fist to her, and when he opened his hand, a gold band shone against his palm.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might feel more comfortable being with me in the way of the humans, since you were raised as one.\u201d</p><p>Andra blinked, unsure her eyes were working. Paul stood and slid the gold ring onto her left hand. \u201cMarry me, Andra. Stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Shock froze her in place and stole the breath from her lungs. She looked down at the ring on her finger. It fit perfectly, glowing without a blemish or scratch. She had no idea how he\u2019d done it.</p><p>She had no idea why he\u2019d want her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. She wanted to say yes, but she couldn\u2019t do that to him. Or herself. He wanted a partner\u2014someone who could stand by his side and fight the Synestryn, someone he could count on. Andra wasn\u2019t that person. She failed when it mattered most, and she didn\u2019t want that for Paul.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be what he wanted. If she loved him, she had to free him to find another woman who could. And she did love him. She knew she did because her heart broke open and bled that she had to let him go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Paul. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His expression hardened, hiding the rejection she knew he had to be feeling. He opened his mouth to say something, but before he could, sirens screamed an alarm into the night.</p><p>\u201cNika.\u201d Andra turned and ran back to Paul\u2019s suite, hearing his pounding footsteps right behind her.</p><p>When they got to the room, Grace was standing in the doorway and Andra could see Nika behind her. There was no blood, no monsters. She was safe.</p><p>Paul picked up the phone and dialed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Grace.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Paul dropped the phone and went to the closet by the front door. He pulled out a heavy leather jacket and zipped it up, pulled some clear safety glasses from the pocket, and slid those on as well. \u201cThe compound has been breached,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to go help fight off the attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>His face was stone cold when he looked at her. \u201cWhatever. But I\u2019m not waiting.\u201d He pulled another jacket from the closet and tossed it to her. \u201cDon\u2019t come out without some protective gear on.\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded and asked Grace, \u201cCan you keep Nika safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady. I\u2019ll have her moved to one of the safe rooms.\u201d</p><p>Andra slid the jacket on and fumbled for the safety glasses in the pocket. \u201cDo you need help?\u201d</p><p>Paul left and didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Grace shook her head, making her curls bob. \u201cNo. I can get one of the human men to help me move her. You\u2019d better go. They\u2019re going to need you.\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded once and ran after Paul.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Andra didn\u2019t see Paul, but she found the fight easily enough. It was raging in an open field at the rear of the compound near the dining hall. Unearthly howls rose up from the fray, clashing with the sickening thuds of steel striking bone. Swords flashed in the predawn light as nearly two dozen men fought off the attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The field was littered with Synestryn bodies, but more of the monsters slithered out of the trees to the west. Some she\u2019d seen before; others she hadn\u2019t. Each of them was scary enough to make her wish for a bed to hide under. That and her shotgun.</p><p>Andra had been in combat before, but never like this. There were so many of them. Dozens. Maybe hundreds. She couldn\u2019t tell with all the thrashing bodies. It wasn\u2019t light out yet, and although the security lights helped, there were still too many shadows. Too many places for more of these things to hide.</p><p>Fear slid under her skin, making it cold and clammy. She stood inside, watching all of this through the glass, trying to absorb it enough to get herself moving.</p><p>She had to do something. People were going to die.</p> <p>Along the far side of the field stood a woman who wouldn\u2019t have even reached Andra\u2019s shoulder. She was dressed in a flowing robe of gray silk with her long dark hair hanging nearly to her hips. She had that delicate bone structure that made Andra feel like an elephant, but there was nothing weak about her. Four monsters built like wolves, with unnatural height and muscle, ran toward her. She stood calmly, lifting only her hand as they charged.</p><p>The first demon to come near her went flying backward and collided with a second one behind it. They both rolled off toward a thick growth of trees as easily as if they\u2019d been tumbleweed. The next one to get near her hit some invisible wall and bounced off with an audible thud. The third used the distraction to sweep around behind the woman and lifted his claws to strike.</p><p>Andra tried to call out a warning, but her breath was stuck in her chest, so she did the only thing she could do. She sprinted out the door and across the training yard, dodging men and monsters in a frantic attempt to reach the unarmed woman before she was slain.</p><p>She made it only a few yards when the little woman jumped over ten feet in the air and landed on a thick branch of a nearby tree.</p><p>The monster that had been trying to kill her raked the air where she\u2019d been a second ago, its own momentum tripping it up so that it landed on the ground. A man she hadn\u2019t even seen a moment ago stepped out from behind a heap of dead monsters and sliced through the thing from its skull to its pelvis.</p> <p>Andra skidded to a stop and realized she was standing in the middle of the battlefield. Something grabbed her arm and shoved her aside just as another of those wolves landed where she\u2019d been standing a split second earlier.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d growled Paul. He didn\u2019t look at her, but kept her shoved behind him and backed up toward the thick trunk of a nearby tree\u2014the only cover available.</p><p>\u201cComing to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen help, but don\u2019t you dare get yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan. What do I do?\u201d</p><p>Something with more legs than Andra could count slithered down out of the tree. Paul saw it and sliced its head off. It didn\u2019t stop moving.</p> <p>He stabbed it with his sword and flung the long body away from them. \u201cBlast something.\u201d</p><p>Right. She could do that. Andra found the power waiting for her, only this time, it was seething with anticipation, as if needing to be used. It leaped to her call and filled her with a glowing kind of pressure. Her body vibrated with strength as she chose her first target.</p><p>One of the monsters was a few yards off, closing in on Morgan\u2019s flank. Andra squeezed a stream of power into a tight ball and flung it out of her body at the thing. A boom shook the earth and a wave of air washed back over them. When she could see again, all that was left of the monster was a cloud of vaporized bits settling slowly to the earth.</p><p>Paul shot her a quick glance over his shoulder. \u201cI meant fire, but that works, too. Good job.\u201d</p><p>His praise made her smile, and she decided she could really get into this whole magical-combat thing. Made her shotgun look like a squirt gun.</p><p>No time to revel in her victory, though. There were monsters to kill.</p><p>Paul kept the Synestryn away from Andra, allowing her room to work. The woman had a gift for destruction. She was laughing as she wielded his power, blowing demon after demon into piles of slurry.</p><p>Angus made his way across the field to Paul\u2019s side. The Gray Lady, Gilda, wasn\u2019t looking so good. In fact, if it weren\u2019t for Angus\u2019s thick arm around her waist, Paul didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to stay standing.</p> <p>He set Gilda on the ground behind Paul and Andra, and took up a defensive position behind her.</p><p>\u201cGilda can\u2019t do any more,\u201d said Angus, slashing at a demon as it charged.</p><p>\u201cMore for me,\u201d shouted Andra. Another cluster of sgath exploded into a cloud of black blood and chunks of fur.</p><p>\u201cI just saw Logan leave the field,\u201d said Paul. \u201cThe sun will be rising any second now.\u201d</p><p>As if his words had summoned dawn, the first direct rays of light peeked over the wall. Thirty feet in front of them, one Synestryn started to smoke. A brief second later, it burst into flames and sprinted for the trees.</p><p>\u201cThe lake!\u201d shouted Angus, loud enough to be heard over the sounds of combat. \u201cDrive them into the lake!\u201d</p><p>Andra looked at Paul. She was breathing hard, sweating and shaking, and her eyes were an angry, bloody red. \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>Paul pointed to the east. \u201cOn the other side of those trees.\u201d</p><p>Gilda grabbed Andra\u2019s ankle before she could run off. \u201cThe smoke,\u201d she panted. \u201cIt will hurt the human children.\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Paul felt her pull on his power, but she was weakening. She\u2019d used so much already and she was still so new at this.</p><p>Instinctively, Paul cupped his left hand around the back of her neck, locking the two parts of the luceria together. Energy streamed along his arm and slid into her.</p><p>A breeze stirred around them, then started swirling faster. Smoke from several burning Synestryn spiraled up and away from the compound.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep this up if we walk?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She apparently didn\u2019t hear him. Her face was a mask of concentration and she held her bottom lip between her teeth.</p><p>\u201cCarry her,\u201d said Angus, bending to the ground to do the same for Gilda. \u201cWe need to follow the men and help them.\u201d</p><p>Paul had to break contact with her necklace, but there was no help for it. He scooped her up and realized that carrying a woman while wielding a naked blade was a learned talent. Angus did it effortlessly, looking like he\u2019d been born to it, but Paul was awkward. His sword bobbed around and he was sure he was going to cut one of them.</p><p>The air continued to spiral around them as they ran, carrying with it the stench of burning demon. By the time they reached the lake, there were only a handful of Synestryn left, and all of them were burning, writhing around in the water in a futile effort to put out the sunlight flames.</p><p>When the last demon fell beneath the water, Paul whispered, \u201cOkay. You can stop now.\u201d</p><p>Andra let out a long breath and her head fell limply against his shoulder. \u201cAir is heavy,\u201d she panted.</p><p>Paul grinned and kissed her temple. \u201cYou did great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the wounded inside,\u201d bellowed Angus.</p><p>Joseph was yards away, but his deep voice rang out, easy to hear. \u201cSanguinar are setting up cots in the dining hall. Any man who isn\u2019t wounded, come with me. We\u2019re going to see how the Synestryn got in.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, there were only a handful of injured men, and those wounds all seemed to be superficial. Morgan had a nasty cut across his brow, but he wiped away the blood and lined up near Joseph.</p><p>Paul told Andra, \u201cI\u2019m taking you back inside so you can rest for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do, you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>Angus\u2019s phone rang. He set Gilda down and slid it out of his rumpled jeans. After a moment, his craggy face twisted with a snarl. \u201cIs there any sign of where they took her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Gilda, her black eyes going wide with shock.</p><p>Angus laid his hand on her head, offering comfort. \u201cIs he going to live?\u201d he asked in a thick, barely controlled voice. \u201cDo what you can. We\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>Gilda pushed herself to her feet and tried to run toward the building. She made it only a few steps before her weakened legs gave out and she fell.</p><p>Angus hurried to her side and helped her up. She fought against him as if trying to get away, but Angus held her tight. \u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019re too weak to do anything right now.\u201d</p><p>Gilda stopped fighting and clung to her husband. Gilda\u2019s shoulders shook with silent sobs. Paul had never seen her cry before, and something inside him broke open at the sight. She\u2019d always been so strong and stoic, no matter what had been thrown at her.</p><p>Angus cradled her in his arms, but his face was anything but comforting. He looked ready to kill.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>Angus\u2019s eyes closed in remorse, and his mouth twisted into a scowl of self-loathing. \u201cThe fight was just a distraction. They got what they really wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSibyl.\u201d</p><p>It took Paul a moment for the words to sink in. \u201cSibyl is gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Angus bit out. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no sign of where they\u2019ve taken her.\u201d Paul thought he saw a sheen of tears in the older man\u2019s eyes. \u201cLogan smelled Cain\u2019s blood and found him half-dead. He said there was no scent trail to follow.\u201d</p><p>Even if there had been one, it probably would have burned off at sunrise. \u201cWas there anything left behind? Did Cain draw blood from one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. None.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to find her,\u201d said Gilda. Her voice was high and desperate against Angus\u2019s shoulder. She looked up at him and Paul could see tears streaming down her smooth cheeks. \u201cWe can\u2019t let them have Sibyl, too.\u201d</p><p>The vague memory of a rumor Paul had once heard tickled his mind, but he couldn\u2019t remember what it was.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her, love.\u201d It was a vow, and Paul felt the power of it coming off Angus in waves.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d demanded Gilda. \u201cThe same way we found Maura?\u201d</p><p>Maura? He\u2019d heard that name before when he was a child, but couldn\u2019t recall who she was.</p><p>Angus\u2019s body tightened like he\u2019d been punched in the gut. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Joseph had apparently seen the commotion and came over to them. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSibyl was taken during the fight,\u201d said Paul to save Angus from having to say the words again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the men on it right now. We\u2019ll find her before sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no trail,\u201d said Angus.</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d demanded Joseph.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>Joseph\u2019s face fell, draining of all hope. His shoulders drooped a little more, and Paul wondered again just how much longer he was going to be able to hold out as leader of their people.</p><p>Andra had been silently watching this exchange, keeping her focus on Gilda and Angus. She pushed against Paul, signaling she wanted to stand on her own. Grudgingly, Paul put her down, but he kept her body tight against his side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reached out and put her hand on Gilda\u2019s shoulder. Her voice was soft, but rang with confidence. \u201cI can find your daughter,\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cDaughter? Sibyl isn\u2019t their daughter,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>No one paid attention to him. All eyes were on Andra. Especially Gilda\u2019s. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Andra shrugged. \u201cFinding the lost is what I do.\u201d</p> <p>Gilda pushed away from Angus and took Andra\u2019s hand in her dainty grip. Tears streamed down her face. \u201cI can\u2019t lose her, too,\u201d whispered Gilda. \u201cPlease find my baby. Bring her back to me.\u201d</p><p>Andra closed her eyes as if trying to block out the sight of the anguish on Gilda\u2019s face. Paul could feel her struggling against herself, her heart and mind warring against each other. Finally, she pulled in a deep, resigned breath. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Andra crumpled to the ground, helpless under the weight of her vow to a grieving mother.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d said Paul. He knelt beside her, running his hands over her face and arms as if worried she\u2019d been hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhat choice did I have? I\u2019ve always been a sucker for a grieving parent. You\u2019d think I would have learned my lesson by now.\u201d She pulled herself together and gathered what little strength she had left. \u201cBesides, if Sibyl can help Nika, then I need her back, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Angus. \u201cFor whatever you\u2019re able to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go see where she was taken from. The longer I wait to do this, the harder it will get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>She waved him off. She still wasn\u2019t comfortable talking about her talent. \u201cCan you show me where her room is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time. I wouldn\u2019t say no to a big cup of coffee, though.\u201d</p> <p>Angus said, \u201cThere\u2019s another way. Paul, you can pull strength from the earth and feed it into her. It\u2019s not safe to do for long, but it will keep her going for a while more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>Paul looked as though he might argue, but then nodded his head. \u201cAs you wish, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>Paul took Andra to Sibyl\u2019s room and stood unobtrusively in the corner while she looked around. Nothing had been moved since they\u2019d discovered Sibyl gone, and the room was perfectly neat, with everything in its place. Even the frilly, ruffled curtains were undisturbed above the gaping window. The only sign that a child had been in this room was the rumpled pink bedding that had been half pulled out the window. Apparently, Sibyl had been ripped from beneath her blankets while she slept.</p><p>The second bedroom in Sibyl\u2019s suite, the one where her bodyguard, Cain, slept, was a different story. That room was a total wreck. Furniture was shattered where Cain or the Synestryn he\u2019d fought had slammed into it. His red blood was splattered across the walls and carpet, but no oily black blood had been found. The Sanguinar still weren\u2019t sure whether Cain was going to live or not.</p><p>Paul prayed they wouldn\u2019t lose him. Of all the men here, he was the one who had resisted the decay of time the best. Maybe it was his role as protector of a child that had kept his soul young and kept his lifemark healthy and strong. If so, then what was going to happen to him now that he\u2019d failed in that role?</p><p>Maybe it would be kinder if he did die. At least then he wouldn\u2019t have to suffer through the guilt of knowing he\u2019d let Sibyl down.</p> <p>Paul sighed. There was too much darkness in their world right now. They all needed Andra to succeed and bring back their only remaining child.</p><p>Andra glided through the room, picking up random objects here and there. She picked up Sibyl\u2019s favorite doll, which had fallen to the floor next to the bed. Its glassy black eyes stared up at her. She stroked the doll\u2019s ringlet curls, and Paul was certain he\u2019d seen the glitter of tears in Andra\u2019s eyes for just a moment before she blinked them away.</p><p>Paul ached to go to her and comfort her, but he didn\u2019t dare interfere. Sibyl had to be found.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Sibyl was Gilda\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that look too many times before to mistake it for anything else. There\u2019s no other look quite as helpless and desperate as that of a parent who has lost their child.\u201d</p><p>It made sense, but it also made Paul question why he hadn\u2019t known who Sibyl really was. Why wouldn\u2019t that have been common knowledge?</p><p>\u201cI really wish you\u2019d leave me alone for a while,\u201d she told Paul.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Not going to happen.\u201d He couldn\u2019t have walked away from her now if she\u2019d put a sword to his throat. She needed him, whether or not she wanted to admit it.</p><p>Andra sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to make fun of me?\u201d There was a flash of insecurity across her face that surprised Paul. He\u2019d never seen her be anything but confident, and that little show of insecurity had him wishing he could pull her into his arms and comfort her.</p><p>\u201cNever. How could I when you\u2019re here helping me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to pretend I\u2019m her. Sleep in her bed. Relive what she saw that night. It feels silly doing it, but it\u2019s what works.\u201d She swallowed hard, and the only sign of her fear was the fine trembling of her fingers around the doll.</p><p>So, she didn\u2019t just have a knack for finding the lost children. She had a gift\u2014one that had to be grounded in magic, if what she was saying were true. Paul made a mental note to pass that information along. It might help the other men find more women like her.</p><p>\u201cHow does it work?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI connect with them. I go to the place where their fear began and I follow that fear.\u201d</p><p>Paul had known Sibyl all his life and had never seen her afraid. She wasn\u2019t like normal children. She hadn\u2019t aged a day in several hundred years, and she could see the future. \u201cWhat if they don\u2019t feel fear?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>Andra lifted one smooth shoulder. \u201cHow could a child not feel fear when she\u2019s forcibly taken from her home?\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019s not truly a child, thought Paul, but he didn\u2019t voice his worry. She needed her confidence right now. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s true. You\u2019ll just have to give it a try.\u201d</p><p>Andra nodded and sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cDo you know what she was wearing last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, but she loved frilly things. All soft pastels with little bits of lace at the neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this doll. Did she sleep with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. It was always with her.\u201d</p><p>Andra lay down on the bed and pulled the covers up over her. She cradled the doll to her chest and closed her eyes. \u201cGive me some time in silence, okay?\u201d</p><p>Paul leaned against the door and let himself stare. He loved watching her. She was beautiful. So precious. The childish things sitting about the room kept a lid on his ever-present lust, but it did little to stop a tightness in his chest from forming as he watched her.</p><p>He loved her so much. He had to figure out a way to convince her to stay here and be with him. She\u2019d refused his proposal, but she still hadn\u2019t taken off the ring he\u2019d given her. The gold band gleamed around her finger, giving Paul a deep sense of satisfaction. No wonder so many human men liked to adorn their women in that fashion, telling all other men they were taken.</p><p>If only she\u2019d agreed to wear it forever rather than rejecting him. Not that he blamed her. After what he\u2019d tried to do to her last night, it was a wonder she hadn\u2019t thrown the ring back at him, or made him choke on it.</p><p>Minutes ticked by and Paul stayed silent, not daring to move for fear of ruining her concentration. After a while, he wondered if she\u2019d just fallen asleep. He knew how tired she was\u2014how thinly stretched she must be after the battle.</p><p>He was just about to go to her when he saw her body stiffen. Her breathing sped up and her grip tightened on the doll. Paul was halfway across the room before he stopped himself. What if this was supposed to happen?</p><p>\u201cI see her,\u201d said Andra in a voice that sounded faint and distant. \u201cThe monsters have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of monsters?\u201d Paul asked before he could stop himself.</p><p>Andra didn\u2019t answer his question, but he wasn\u2019t sure if it was because she didn\u2019t hear him or because she didn\u2019t know how to answer. She hadn\u2019t been raised among his kind and she might not know the names for various types of Synestryn.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive. Thirsty. She\u2019s not scared. How can she not be scared?\u201d Andra\u2019s tone was full of wonder before it turned frightened. \u201cOh, God! They see me. They know me.\u201d</p><p>Paul felt panic clog his throat, making it hard to breathe. She\u2019d made some sort of connection with the Synestryn, and that could not be a good thing.</p><p>He knelt at Andra\u2019s side and shook her. \u201cCome back, honey,\u201d he urged. He pulled her limp body into his arms and kept shaking her, hoping to bring her out of whatever trance or dream she was in. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can they know me?\u201d She gasped and her body jerked. \u201cThey want my blood. My family\u2019s blood. They\u2019ve had Tori\u2019s and Nika\u2019s, and now they want mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake up!\u201d shouted Paul, and he forced a spike of power into his words, compelling her to obey.</p><p>Andra\u2019s eyes opened and fear bleached the color from her face.</p><p>Paul pulled her close and rocked her body like a child. \u201cYou\u2019re okay now,\u201d he soothed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? What went wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe monsters took Sibyl to the same place where they killed my baby sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I . . . sensed that she\u2019d been there.\u201d She shook her head as if trying to make sense out of it. \u201cI\u2019ve looked for years to find her body so I could bury her next to Mom. Even though I can feel it, I\u2019ve never been able to find that place, no matter how hard I try. It\u2019s too well hidden.\u201d Her fingers dug into his back and she whispered against his neck, \u201cI\u2019ve already failed, Paul. Sibyl was taken to the same place Tori was, and I\u2019ll never be able to find it.\u201d</p><p>Andra took deep breaths, trying to calm herself enough to think straight. The weight of failure bore down on her, driving all hope away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Paul. His big hands were stroking over her back, trying to ease away some of her tension. \u201cWe\u2019ll find Sibyl together.\u201d</p><p>Even if she did know where to go, how could she go there? How could she face that place knowing she\u2019d already let it kill Tori? \u201cWhat if we can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Andra could feel the force of her vow to Gilda pulling at her, demanding she try again. The place she\u2019d been was so dark and filled with evil, she didn\u2019t want to go back. She didn\u2019t want to face what had happened to Tori. What she\u2019d let happen to the little girl who\u2019d trusted Andra to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cWe can,\u201d said Paul, complete confidence strengthening his tone. \u201cYou may not have been able to succeed before, but you\u2019ve got me now. You\u2019ve got all my strength, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had no choice but to try. Even if she hadn\u2019t given her vow to Gilda, she still had Nika to think about.

Leaning on him felt good, but it didn\u2019t make her feel strong, and she really needed that right now. \u201cI need to figure out how to get there. I\u2019m going to try again.\u201d</p><p>Paul cupped her face and slid his thumb along her cheek. His brown eyes were filled with love and compassion, even though she\u2019d refused to marry him less than an hour ago. She had no idea how he could look at her like that after knowing the things she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here,\u201d he told her, and pressed a soft kiss to her mouth. \u201cI know you can do this.\u201d</p> <p>His faith in her was humbling, and she didn\u2019t want to let him down.</p><p>She lay back on the bed, closed her eyes again, and took a few deep breaths. The pleasant warmth of Paul\u2019s hand on hers distracted her for a few minutes until she got used to his touch. Slowly, their skin warmed to the same temperature and his hand became a part of her.</p><p>She pushed out all unnecessary thoughts and focused solely on Sibyl. She imagined the little girl lying asleep in her bed, hugging her favorite doll, completely unaware that she was in danger. It was easy to see her sleeping peacefully with her cheeks flushed pink and her hair mussed around her face.</p><p>Now that Andra had that image, she tried to imagine what happened next. Had Sibyl heard a sound and woken, or had she been asleep until the moment that she was dragged from her bed? Andra went through each possibility until one felt right and it sucked her in, taking over her mind, drawing her into the image until it surrounded her.</p><p>Sibyl had been awake when the thing came for her. It was dark, both inside and out. She\u2019d heard its claws on the window as it slid the glass up. She\u2019d lain there, frozen in place, but not by terror. By acceptance. She\u2019d known it was going to happen\u2014that there was nothing she could have done to stop it.</p> <p>Or rather, there was nothing she was going to do to stop it, which was somehow worse.</p><p>Either way, Sibyl had felt no fear, which was what Andra had always used as a trail to follow the path a stolen child had taken. Without that trail, she had no way of figuring out where Sibyl had gone.</p><p>Andra searched for something to grasp on to. Something she could use. She struggled to stay relaxed and open her mind up to the possibilities. Maybe the monster had left a trail she could follow.</p><p>She felt around for a sense of satisfaction that she imagined the thing might feel at having won its prize. There was nothing there she could connect with. The thing was too inhuman\u2014almost mindless except for the throbbing presence of hunger that controlled it, and that was too scattered to latch onto.</p><p>Dimly, Andra was aware that her already fatigued body was wearing down under the strain of staying in this trancelike state too long. She had to hurry.</p><p>What had she grasped on to before when she\u2019d found Sibyl the first time? She\u2019d been in Sibyl\u2019s head, if only for a moment. There had to have been something that she used as a trail. What was it?</p> <p>The vision she\u2019d created in her mind started to fade as her body gave out; then she remembered she wasn\u2019t alone. Paul was here. She could use his power.</p><p>Andra reached inside herself to that warm glowing spot where Paul\u2019s skin touched hers. The luceria around her neck vibrated with energy. All she had to do was figure out how to use it for something as delicate as this. Combat was easy; she\u2019d always had a knack for blowing things up. This stuff was much harder.</p><p>Nothing changed, and her strength was dwindling fast. She could feel her physical body shaking under the stress and tried to ignore it.</p><p>Desperate to find Sibyl, Andra focused on the exact spot where the luceria touched his matching ring. She could feel a tiny spark there, like static electricity arcing between two points. She reached for that spot, grasped hold of it with all her desperation and hope. Power flared inside her, filling her chest with heat. She was no longer tired. No longer weak. She felt invincible.</p><p>Instincts screamed at her to hurry, that she had no time to waste, so she lifted her hand and focused all that power so that it formed a sphere around her body. She willed the sphere to show her where to look for the trail\u2014to highlight it so she could follow it.</p><p>One side of the globe flared to life and Andra knew that was her trail. She examined it. Poked at it until she felt what it was.</p><p>Acceptance.</p><p>Sibyl had accepted her fate, and the force of that emotion was so strong that it had left a trail\u2014not as strong as fear, but strong enough that Andra could follow it.</p> <p>Andra latched onto that acceptance, memorized it until she would know the feeling anywhere\u2014be able to follow it wherever it led.</p><p>She followed the path south, her mind racing along it until she collided with a hard barrier. She found herself in a dark room with a single bare lightbulb overhead. The edges of the room were hidden in shadows, but somehow still pulsed with colors. Swirls of blue and green bloomed along the edges of the shapeless room. It reminded her of the sea swirling about rocks as the water was sucked back into the ocean by the tide.</p><p>Andra had been here before, if only for a brief moment. This was Sibyl\u2019s mind.</p><p>From the shadows of those billowing clouds of color came a little girl. Sibyl.</p><p>She wore a frilly white dress and lacy ankle socks with shiny leather shoes. Her hair was a cascade of perfect blond ringlets tied back with a pink satin bow. In her arms, she held a doll that looked like her miniature twin, but instead of Sibyl\u2019s pale blue eyes, the doll had glassy, dead black eyes like those of a shark. It was the doll Andra\u2019s body was holding now.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come to me soon enough,\u201d said Sibyl. \u201cIt\u2019s too late now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t come sooner. We just found out you were missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean that I told Paul to bring you to me the night he found you. He failed to do so and now it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. No one ever does.\u201d The colors behind her darkened to a deep, desolate purple. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here. She\u2019s looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is \u2018she\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Sibyl looked over her shoulder, as if expecting someone to pop out from behind her. \u201cStay away. It\u2019s not safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I am coming to take you home,\u201d explained Andra.</p><p>\u201cIf you come here, you\u2019ll be sorry,\u201d warned the child in a singsong voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never regret helping you get home to your family.\u201d</p><p>Her chubby cheeks fell into a blank mask and that familiar sense of acceptance that Andra had memorized flooded her senses. \u201cIf you must come, at least wait until it\u2019s safer. Until she is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe? Who?\u201d</p><p>Sibyl hesitated for a moment, as if weighing a decision. \u201cThe one who brought me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than most.\u201d</p><p>Andra had no clue what to make of that, so she ignored it for the sake of time. She didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d be able to hold her connection with Sibyl, as weak as her body was. \u201cTell me where you are so we can come find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will find me on your own or not at all. I will not help you suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to suffer unless I fail to bring you home safe. Please help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must remain neutral,\u201d said Sibyl.</p><p>\u201cNeutral? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot choose sides. It would give her the freedom to act. I cannot allow that. Not now, when so much hangs in the balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, baby? You\u2019re not making any sense. Have you hit your head?\u201d</p><p>Sibyl\u2019s blue eyes blazed until they glowed bright yellow. Her mouth tightened in anger, and Andra had the impression that she\u2019d grown a few inches. The walls behind her pulsed with furious orange plumes among the bruised colors. \u201cI am in my right mind, Theronai. Do not question my sanity. There can be no good end here. I seek only to prevent your suffering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone must. The Sentinels need you more than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one I want to help,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>Her tiny shoulders straightened in a pose of false confidence Andra knew only too well. \u201cI am . . . expendable,\u201d said Sibyl.</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re not. No child is.\u201d</p><p>Sibyl smiled, but it wasn\u2019t the smile of a child. It was too cunning and condescending for that. \u201cWhat if I were to tell you that more than one child will die if you perish trying to save me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Paul about what I cannot know,\u201d said Sibyl, mocking Andra for her ignorance. \u201cHow many impossible things have you seen in your short time with Paul, young Theronai?\u201d</p><p>The creepy little girl had a point, but that wasn\u2019t going to change Andra\u2019s mind. \u201cI made a promise to bring you home, and that\u2019s what I intend to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Gilda. Cunning wench,\u201d she said with a note of approval in her tone. \u201cShe seeks only to protect her kind, but she has always made blind decisions. I wish I were so blessed with blindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only trying to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need no more help from her.\u201d</p><p>Okay, apparently there was some bad blood there. \u201cThen let me help you,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cIf you do, Paul will be by your side. But be warned that he views his life as no more important than a single grain of sand on the beach. There are many more just like him and the absence of one will go unnoticed. He will not hesitate to end his life so that yours may continue.\u201d</p><p>My life for yours, he had vowed. She believed he meant it, but Andra wouldn\u2019t let him die to save her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be careful,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cYou should stay with your sister. My captors do not seek to harm me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why take you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy indeed? Perhaps you should ask yourself that until you come to the same conclusion I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you\u2019ll have to figure out for yourself.\u201d The child smiled, gave a negligent wave of her hand, and Andra was thrown from Sibyl\u2019s mind without any option but to go. She flew through blackness until she landed with a thud inside her own head.</p><p>Slowly, she reconnected with her body and wished she hadn\u2019t bothered. Fatigue swamped her, and her muscles were sore from prolonged shivering. She felt cold. Weak. Too tired to even bother opening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d asked Paul. His voice was harsh with controlled panic.</p><p>Andra made an affirmative grunting noise, but could do no more.</p><p>\u201cYou were out for way too long. I\u2019m taking you to bed,\u201d he told her, and she felt herself being lifted in his arms. Had she been able to open her mouth, she would have scolded him for treating her like a child, but as it was, she just didn\u2019t have the strength to care. He was holding her and that was enough.</p><p>She had a little girl to save, and she was going to need every bit of help she could get. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 27</p><p>Paul was worried. Andra hadn\u2019t resisted when he tucked her into bed, which meant she was a lot worse off than he\u2019d hoped. She\u2019d told him that they had to leave as soon as she could find the trail again, and asked him to gather as many men as he could.</p><p>He\u2019d gone to do just that when he saw Angus turn the corner at the end of the hall. The older man wasn\u2019t moving with his normal fluid grace. Instead, his movements were jerky and rigid, as if he were injured.</p><p>Then again, his daughter was missing. That was more than enough pain for any man to bear.</p> <p>\u201cCan she help?\u201d he asked Paul without greeting.</p><p>Paul nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s going to try. She said she made contact with Sibyl and that she\u2019s still alive and unharmed.\u201d</p><p>Angus covered his face and let out a deep breath of relief.</p><p>\u201cShe also said that Sibyl doesn\u2019t want her to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy poor baby girl,\u201d whispered Angus. \u201cShe probably thinks Andra is more important to us than she is. She\u2019s always felt that, because she never reached maturity and can\u2019t bond with any of our men, she was somehow flawed and unimportant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. How many times has she saved our lives with her predictions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve always told her, but I guess a father\u2019s opinion doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was your daughter. How could I not have known?\u201d</p><p>Angus shrugged. \u201cSibyl and Gilda don\u2019t get along. There aren\u2019t many men left alive who were there when Sibyl was born, and somewhere along the line, she just stopped claiming us. Even though she has a child\u2019s body, she\u2019s been a grown woman for a long time. It seemed the least we could do was respect her wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy has she never grown?\u201d</p><p>Angus\u2019s blue eyes clouded with a mixture of anger and sadness. \u201cI won\u2019t answer that. Ask her if you want to know, though I doubt she\u2019d tell you.\u201d</p> <p>That meant it was officially none of his business. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find her, Angus. I know Andra can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you already left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe nearly killed herself making contact with Sibyl. She needs a few minutes to rest before she finds the path. Besides, we\u2019re going to need to gather the men who are able to come with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go.\u201d</p><p>Paul put his hand on Angus\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOf course you\u2019re going. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many men do we need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just going to see Joseph about that. I don\u2019t know how many we can spare with the wall breached. We can\u2019t leave the place unguarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to Joseph,\u201d said Angus. \u201cYou go pick your men and I\u2019ll see to it that they\u2019re ours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t leave the humans unguarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ask him to, but he owes me some favors and I\u2019m calling them in. She\u2019s my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded. \u201cMeet me back at my suite in an hour. We\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been driving southeast for most of the day when Andra lost the trail. Frustration bubbled up inside her, making her want to scream.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she told Madoc, who was driving the giant SUV they\u2019d been given. The thing held eight normal-size people, but only five Theronai and herself. It was packed shoulder-to-massive-shoulder with warriors, all of whom were now looking at her.</p><p>\u201cIs this the place?\u201d asked Morgan from the front seat. His brown skin and feral expression made his eyes look like they were glowing. There was something predatory about him\u2014graceful, quiet movements ruled him, as if he were hunting for something no matter where he went.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Andra, hearing the sound of defeat in her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve lost the path.\u201d</p><p>Madoc checked the clock on the dashboard. \u201cIt\u2019ll be dark in another two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to try again, or call it a night?\u201d asked Paul. He hadn\u2019t stopped touching her since they\u2019d left Dabyr. His arm was around her shoulders, holding her close to his side.</p><p>Even with the heat of his body, Andra was cold, and so tired she could barely keep her eyes open.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave her to spend the night with those things. I have to try again.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded his understanding. \u201cEveryone out,\u201d he ordered. \u201cGive us a few minutes. Madoc, go tell Angus and the others what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Madoc gave an affirmative grunt and all four men got out of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cLie down on the seat,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Andra didn\u2019t need a second offer. Her body was so heavy and numb with weariness, she felt like her skin had turned to lead. Paul had shoved his big body in the space between the two front seats and the backseat where she lay. He looked almost comical crouched there in the small space, and for some reason, it made her heart give a little flop in her chest.</p><p>She realized at that moment that this man would do anything for her. He was commitment and loyalty personified. So long as he drew breath, he would do whatever it took to make her safe and happy. Including forfeit his life.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let that happen. She needed to give him his ring back and separate herself from him before she no longer could. The idea of staying with him was becoming more temptation than she could stand. If she didn\u2019t walk away soon, she never would, and that scared the hell out of her, because she knew how it would end\u2014the same way it had for Mom and Tori and Nika. She\u2019d do something wrong and she\u2019d have to watch another person she loved suffer or die.</p><p>The realization that she loved him stunned her stupid for a moment, and she hadn\u2019t heard what he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d</p><p>Hardly, but she nodded anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d he asked, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried about Sibyl,\u201d she lied.</p><p>Paul smoothed her hair away from her face and gave her an encouraging smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>Such faith. She had no idea where he found it after all he\u2019d been through, all he\u2019d seen of her past, but if he could have faith, then she would, too.</p><p>Andra took his left hand and kissed his palm before she settled it around her throat. The two parts of the luceria locked together and she was flooded with a heady rush of power that never ceased to amaze her.</p><p>She was going to miss that almost as much as she was going to miss Paul.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you go,\u201d he told her as if reading her thoughts. \u201cFair warning.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think about that right now. She had to concentrate.</p><p>Andra closed her eyes and searched for that trail of acceptance. It was nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cHand me the doll,\u201d she said.</p><p>Paul pulled it out of a duffel bag and gave it to her. The cool weight of the doll\u2019s porcelain head rested over her heart. She smelled the faint scent of sunshine and roses clinging to it. Sibyl\u2019s scent. This doll was somehow part of her, vibrating with its own kind of energy that Andra didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Maybe this was what psychics felt when they connected with an object. It wasn\u2019t painful, but neither was it completely comfortable. The doll had a jumbled, chaotic feeling about it\u2014a shadow or blemish that Andra couldn\u2019t see, but could feel.</p><p>As her body fell away, she was flung across the sky and plunged down into the earth. Her head spun and she felt nauseated even though she was no longer inside her body.</p><p>A single bare lightbulb hung from the ceiling of a room with no walls, only swirling plumes of color. Andra recognized it as Sibyl\u2019s mind, even though the colors were darker now. There were no hopeful pastel hues, only deep, muted browns and grays.</p><p>Sibyl stepped out from one of the plumes. This time she was wearing a frilly black gown covered in artistically shredded tatters of lace. Her eyes were rimmed with liner and her lips covered in a garish red gloss. Her fingernails were long and painted black.</p><p>\u201cTrying out a new look?\u201d asked Andra, unable to keep the parental dismay from her tone.</p><p>Sibyl frowned for a moment; then a satisfied smile stretched her painted lips. Her appearance changed back to the more appropriately girlish attire, complete with ankle socks and pink bows. No more baby hooker. \u201cBetter?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you came,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted me to stay away.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. This place is horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where you are?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She waved her hand and a map that looked similar to a satellite image, but recorded from a lower angle, appeared. She pointed at one spot while Andra frantically tried to memorize the nearby highways and streets. It was in northern Alabama, only two or three hours from where they were.</p><p>\u201cCan you find me?\u201d asked Sibyl in a voice that shook with a mere hint of fear. She hadn\u2019t been afraid before, but maybe things had gotten worse where she was.</p><p>Andra filled her voice with confidence to help soothe the child. \u201cI can now. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? Who\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are ten men with me, Gilda, and Helen.\u201d She hadn\u2019t had time to do more than meet Helen, but Paul said she was powerful. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you out.\u201d</p><p>Sibyl\u2019s eyes gleamed with a flash of anger at the mention of her mother\u2019s name. It was then that Andra noticed that her eyes were no longer blue. They\u2019d gone completely black.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right here.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your eyes?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sibyl shrugged a dainty shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s the darkness. All of the Theronai\u2019s eyes turn black after they\u2019ve been out of the light for a while.\u201d</p><p>Poor thing. All that darkness had to be hard to tolerate, even if she wasn\u2019t easily scared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can. You just hold on, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was faint and tinted with sorrow. \u201cI\u2019ll try. Please hurry. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can stand this. They have me locked up in a cage with the skeleton of another little girl. I know they\u2019re going to leave me here to die.\u201d</p><p>Andra\u2019s throat closed off, choking her with anguish. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s wearing a pink nightgown just like me. They let her die in this cage all alone.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Tori. She\u2019d been wearing a pink nightgown the night she was taken. Her body was still there.</p><p>Andra felt her heart rip open all over again. Anguish bled from her, but it didn\u2019t lessen. She could still feel every sharp stab of guilt, every grinding wave of grief, as if Tori had been taken just last night.</p><p>Before she realized what had happened, she was back inside her body, sobbing.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d Paul held her, rocking her against his solid chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found her,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, right? Now we can go get her back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. I mean I found Tori.

She didn\u2019t know how she would have lived through this without him. Even now, her heart was struggling to beat against the pressure of her grief. Her baby sister had died alone in some cave, and Andra hadn\u2019t been able to stop it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll recover her body,\u201d whispered Paul. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring her home.\u201d</p> <p>Andra tried to control her breathing and quiet the sobs that shook her. She wanted to give up, to curl in on herself and cry until nothing mattered anymore and all the pain was gone. But Sibyl needed her. She owed it to Tori not to let another little girl die alone in the dark.</p><p>She pushed away from Paul, already missing the animal comfort of his warm body. \u201cWe need to get moving. We\u2019re not far away now, and night is coming.\u201d</p><p>Paul grudgingly let her go. He gently wiped her tears away and kissed her forehead. \u201cSibyl is lucky to have someone as brave and strong as you on her side. So am I.\u201d</p><p>She was going to miss him. Their time together was up in only a few more hours.</p><p>His kind brown eyes swept over her face as if soaking her in. \u201cDon\u2019t think about that now. You\u2019ve got enough to deal with to also be thinking about our future.\u201d</p> <p>They didn\u2019t have a future. Not really. And as hard as it would be to walk away from him now that she loved him, she would have done it all again in a heartbeat. She now had proof that real courage and honor existed to fight back the ugly things in the world.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked like he wanted to say something more to her, but instead he nodded. \u201cSibyl needs us.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later, they found the cave where Sibyl was being held. The strain on Andra was nearly too much for Paul to bear. She was pushing herself, and if he hadn\u2019t felt her desperate need to see this through\u2014if he hadn\u2019t known that failing would kill something inside her\u2014he would have demanded she stay behind in the SUV.</p><p>Not that he had any real right to demand anything from her. Less than an hour remained on the clock before his luceria fell from her neck and he was once again alone.</p><p>Paul looked at his ring. The colors had solidified completely, which meant their bond was complete. Breaking it would kill him. Unless she changed her mind about leaving him, he wasn\u2019t going to live to see sunrise. If he tried to hold out, Andra would end up paying the price. He\u2019d already tried to force her to stay with him once. As soon as his soul started to die off, there would be nothing to stop him from finishing what he\u2019d started. The only way to keep her safe was to walk away for good.</p> <p>The saddest part of knowing that wasn\u2019t that his life was ending\u2014he\u2019d had a long, full life. The saddest part was going to be leaving Andra alone. She didn\u2019t deserve that. She deserved to be happy. To be loved.</p><p>Maybe Iain could give her what she really needed once Paul was out of the way.</p><p>It was full dark now, and based on the trampled dirt and vegetation near the cave entrance, most of the Synestryn had already gone out to hunt.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d asked Gilda, the Gray Lady. The woman looked like she was barely holding herself together. Angus\u2019s arm was supporting her, keeping Gilda from swaying with weakness.</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d said Andra. \u201cAbout a quarter mile from here.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas surveyed the surrounding land. \u201cThis whole area is low. We\u2019re bound to run into some water.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That made this whole rescue effort a lot more dangerous. They weren\u2019t just going to be fighting demons; they also had to make sure they didn\u2019t drown.</p><p>\u201cThe tracks they left behind aren\u2019t muddy, so maybe we\u2019ll get lucky,\u201d said Paul.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Madoc snorted. \u201c \u2019Cause that happens all the fucking time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d ordered Angus. \u201cWe\u2019re going in, regardless. Paul, Andra, Madoc, Nicholas, Gilda, and I are going in. The rest of you guard our exit. Don\u2019t let anything come back in and sneak up behind us.\u201d</p><p>Everyone nodded. Helen pushed her braids behind her shoulders, lifted her hands, and a ring of fire erupted around the vehicles and the entrance. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to come through that first,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Angus. \u201cThat\u2019ll help. Andra, you stay behind me and Gilda.\u201d</p><p>Andra stepped forward. \u201cI need to go in first so I can see the way. Besides, Gilda looks like she\u2019s about to fall over.\u201d</p><p>The Gray Lady straightened her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m fine, stronger than a child like you on your best day.\u201d</p><p>Angus stepped in front of his wife and lifted her chin. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We do it her way. She\u2019s gotten us this far, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Gilda gave a slight nod and looked away. \u201cFine. Let her go first.\u201d</p><p>Andra was already at the mouth of the cave when Paul caught up to her. \u201cYou need to be in constant contact with my power. Something nasty could pop up, and you won\u2019t have time to react if you\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I can do that.\u201d He felt her reach out to him and open herself up. Their conduit was larger now than it had been only hours ago. Power flowed easily out of him, making his body sing.</p><p>\u201cTell her about the seeing-in-the-dark thing,\u201d called Helen. \u201cShe\u2019s going to need that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. If you funnel some power to your eyes, you can see in the dark. Just be careful not to do too much, though. You could hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. I can see everything. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>The tunnel went down steeply for twenty feet before it leveled off. This wasn\u2019t a nice, well-planned mine. It was a natural cave with plenty of twists and turns and no nice, flat surface to walk on. At one point, they had to squeeze one at a time through an opening no wider than his shoulders.</p><p>The smell of damp earth and decay clung to the air. A steady drip from a hundred places echoed off the walls. Boots scraped behind them, and Madoc grunted as he tried to fit his big body through the hole.</p><p>Andra and Paul waited on the far side of the small opening for everyone to catch up. Gilda slid through easily, but Angus wasn\u2019t so lucky. Nicholas had just as much trouble and ended up losing a chunk of his shirt in the process.</p><p>Paul could feel Andra\u2019s nerves jumping around anxiously. She wanted to get moving, and he couldn\u2019t blame her. Every second Sibyl was with the Synestryn, she was in danger.</p><p>As soon as Nicholas was through, Andra and Paul moved into another tunnel that led down deeper into the earth. They had to crawl on their hands and knees here, and Paul\u2019s shoulders brushed the walls of the tunnel.</p><p>The tunnel widened until Andra was able to stand up. Paul had to keep his head down, but at least he was giving his knees a break.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, breaking the bleak silence. \u201cHow long do I have to be in the dark before my eyes turn black?\u201d</p><p>Paul had no idea what she was talking about. \u201cWhy would your eyes turn black?\u201d</p><p>The tunnel ended and at the mouth of it was a large cavern with room enough to breathe. They all filed out and Andra pressed on, crossing to an opening on the left.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Sibyl told me. Her eyes were black the last time I saw her, and she said it was because she\u2019d been in the dark so long.\u201d</p><p>From behind them, he heard Gilda, and her tone was so odd, so full of shock and fear, it stopped everyone dead in their tracks. \u201cYou saw a girl who looked like Sibyl with black eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Angus drew his sword.</p><p>All the color drained from Gilda\u2019s face. \u201cWhat else did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave me the map so I could find her,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>Gilda clutched Angus\u2019s arm. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t Sibyl. That was Maura. We\u2019re walking right into a trap.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>A deep rumble shook the ground around Andra\u2019s body. Dust spilled from the ceiling, then small rocks. She looked up in shock and saw a crack had formed overhead. And it was getting wider.</p><p>Paul pulled Andra out of the way and shoved her into the tunnel for cover just as large rocks started dropping from above.</p><p>Shouts rose up on the opposite side of the cavern. Gilda screamed. Then Andra could hear nothing but the sound of rocks grating against one another as they filled the room.</p><p>\u201cDown the tunnel,\u201d shouted Paul, pushing her to get her moving.</p><p>Andra moved. Adrenaline made her arms and legs move as fast as her pounding heart. She scurried down the tunnel until it let out into a shallow pit. She slid out of the opening and down until she was standing on a shelf of rock. She moved over so there was room for Paul beside her.</p><p>Dust coated his body, and there was an ugly scratch on his cheek. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked around a cough.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You?\u201d</p><p>He nodded absently, but he was looking the way they came, as if hoping to see the rest of their group.</p><p>\u201cThey were trapped on the other side, right? Not caught under all that rock?\u201d She prayed it was true.</p><p>Paul\u2019s grim expression didn\u2019t give her much comfort. His jaw was tight with anger, and his eyes promised retribution. \u201cWe\u2019re on our own now. We can either go back or move forward into the trap. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it is a trap, we can\u2019t leave Tori here. Or Sibyl. At least now we know it\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we do rescue her, we\u2019re not going to have any fun trying to find a way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll blast one open if I need to.\u201d</p><p>Just then, the luceria fell from her throat. Andra caught it before it could hit the ground.</p><p>Paul sucked in a pained breath. \u201cOur time is up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need more,\u201d said Andra.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your call. Not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it on. Give me a new vow.\u201d He looked as if he were about to say something else, then clamped his lips shut.</p><p>Andra locked the luceria back in place. Paul\u2019s eyes went to it and the look of longing on his face nearly made her weep. He fell to his knees and scored a line in his skin, through his shirt. \u201cMy life for yours, Andra. Always.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. She needed time to think. What would happen to Paul if she died while wearing this thing? What if she didn\u2019t make it back out alive? It was a trap. She had to remember that.</p><p>He wanted forever. She couldn\u2019t let herself want that, too. At least not until she was sure she wouldn\u2019t be a liability to him\u2014until his people figured out whether there were more women out there like her who could be a better match for him.</p><p>He thought he wanted forever now, but what would happen if they found more women next week? She didn\u2019t want to trap him. She didn\u2019t want him to die along with her if she messed this up and failed to get everyone out alive.</p><p>\u201cAn hour,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat should be enough to get us out of here, right? If not, we can go for another hour.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s mouth tightened and his jaw bunched with anger. \u201cAn hour. I understand now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andra wasn\u2019t sure what he understood, but he wasn\u2019t letting her inside his mind so she could figure it out. He was cold and stiff beside her.</p><p>The band tightened around her throat, nestling close to her skin. No vision appeared, but she really didn\u2019t need one to know what he was feeling. He was pissed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get moving.\u201d</p><p>Andra yearned to explain herself to him, but there wasn\u2019t time. \u201cIt\u2019s not much farther.\u201d</p> <p>They moved the rest of the way carefully. Paul kept his eyes on the ceiling of rock above them, looking for more signs of danger.</p><p>The better part of that hour had passed by the time they neared a corner and Andra felt a wave of malicious intent sweep out over her. It stole the warmth from her body until her bones ached with cold. She stopped dead in her tracks, unable to take another step.</p><p>A deep groan from Paul told her he\u2019d felt it, too. \u201cThis isn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean we can\u2019t stay here long. It\u2019ll kill us.\u201d</p> <p>Part of her didn\u2019t mind the idea.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not you. That\u2019s the fog talking. Ignore it. Think of something happy and get moving.\u201d</p><p>Something happy. Tori\u2019s face popped into her head. Her crooked smile showing off her two missing front teeth. The smell of her hair when they\u2019d lain on the couch together and watched cartoons. The sound of her giggles when Andra would swing her around by her arms.</p><p>She would have been sixteen if she\u2019d lived\u2014too big to swing around anymore.</p><p>The empty duffel bag over her shoulder felt like it weighed a ton. It wasn\u2019t big, but Paul had promised her it would be large enough to hold her bones.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not happy,\u201d said Paul.</p> <p>Andra tried to refocus her thoughts, but it wasn\u2019t easy. She had way too much stuff dancing around in her brain for her to concentrate. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Paul drew his sword and they stepped out around the corner together. A metal cage about ten feet on each side sat in the far corner of the cavern. The floor was littered with trash, bones, and bits of fur. Inside the cage, Sibyl sat hugging her legs. Beside her was a pile of bones and the tattered remains of clothing. A pink nightgown. The color of the gown on the skeleton had faded out over time, and was covered in dust, but she knew it was pink because she recognized it. It had been Tori\u2019s favorite\u2014one she begged Andra to wash so she could wear it again every night.</p><p>Andra reached for Paul\u2019s arm to steady herself. She could barely breathe. Seeing her sister\u2019s body after all these years was more than she could stand. The grief nearly crushed her and ripped at her heart until she no longer cared whether she drew in her next breath. If death eased this pain, then she would welcome it. She would wrap herself around her sister and let it come take her.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d growled Paul. \u201cYou\u2019re letting the fog in.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his voice, Sibyl lifted her head. Andra expected to see tears, but her blue eyes were dry and her face was calm. Only her voice gave away her disappointment. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come. My sister is going to kill us all now.\u201d</p><p>Another Sibyl floated down from a ledge above them. Her black skirt billowed out as she settled to the ground. This Sibyl had black eyes and a vicious smile tilting her painted mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill all of you,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI need you, sister, and your pretty, shiny soul.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, things started to fall into place for Andra. All the small differences made sense. There were two of them. Andra had somehow ended up in this girl\u2019s head when she went seeking out Sibyl. She\u2019d found Sibyl when she\u2019d been in her bed, but once all she had to connect her was the doll\u2014the one with glassy black eyes\u2014she\u2019d somehow reached the other girl instead.</p><p>Paul stepped in front of her. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaura. Sibyl\u2019s sister. I thought the resemblance was a dead giveaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from her,\u201d warned Sibyl. \u201cShe\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for that. You should have listened when you had the chance,\u201d said Maura. She lifted her tiny hand and monsters flowed in like water, dribbling out of tunnels high up the walls. They landed like heavy raindrops or crawled down the cave walls, sticking like spiders.</p><p>Fear took a firm hold of Andra and locked her feet to the earth. There were too many of them. She and Paul were never going to live through this.</p><p>\u201cNo time for that,\u201d said Paul. \u201cPull it together.\u201d He grabbed her arm and dragged her toward the cage holding Sibyl. \u201cCome on, Andra. I need you here with me.\u201d</p><p>Right. Sibyl needed her, too.</p><p>Andra gave herself a mental slap and tried to think what she could do to save them. There was no way she could fight them all. What she really needed was to find a way to keep the monsters from hurting them.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, Andra formed a bubble around them to hold back the slavering monsters. It took an enormous amount of power\u2014more than she\u2019d ever used before. Her nerve endings screamed at the force of that much energy traveling through her, but she managed to suffer through the pain.</p><p>Furry, clawed things bounced off of it as they charged, making it ripple like waves over a pond.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work,\u201d said Paul, pride ringing in his voice. \u201cHow long can you hold it?\u201d</p><p>Already sweat started beading up on her skin from the effort. \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hurry.\u201d</p><p>The strap of the bag over her shoulder disappeared. She couldn\u2019t let herself become distracted by thinking about what that meant, so she didn\u2019t. She heard the screech of metal bending too fast and a soft word of thanks from Sibyl.</p><p>The monsters pounded the shield, and Andra felt every one of the impacts like a sledgehammer blow to her brain. Sweat slid down her temples and her legs started to shake. Paul\u2019s power flowed into her, but she used every bit of it for the shield as it came to her, leaving her none to strengthen herself. She felt hollowed out\u2014a thin shell of brittle skin was all that was left of her, and that was threatening to crumble.</p><p>The dry rattle of bones filled her ears and she had to cover them and block out the sound. Paul was gathering up what was left of her sister. Poor, sweet Tori.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, baby.</p><p>Tears joined the sweat running down her face.</p><p>The shield faltered and one of the things with glowing green eyes broke through. \u201cPaul!\u201d she shouted, and lifted her hands to channel more power toward the breach. She wasn\u2019t sure if the hand motion did any good, but it was worth a shot.</p><p>Paul\u2019s sword came into her field of vision. It slashed through the air between her and the charging monster, lopping off one of the beast\u2019s paws. The thing howled and black blood spewed over the rocks.</p><p>He finished it off with a quick series of slices that sent its head rolling away. He kicked the body as far as the shield would allow, where it twitched as the blood drained from it.</p><p>Andra re-formed the shield to get the thing away from all of them before the blood could burn them. She felt the luceria heat as she forced yet more power into her body. Sweat evaporated from her skin in small tendrils of steam. Her head throbbed in time with the crash of monsters against the shield.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to be able to hold it much longer.</p><p>A small, cool hand slipped into hers. \u201cYou can do this,\u201d Sibyl said, her child\u2019s voice steady and trusting, as if she hadn\u2019t spent the day locked in a cage with the remains of the sister Andra hadn\u2019t been able to save.</p><p>\u201cTime to go,\u201d shouted Paul.</p><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d Andra gasped. They were surrounded. Only the bubble she\u2019d built held the demons away. Already the monsters were covering it, scratching and clawing as they tried to find a way inside.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about flying?\u201d asked Paul.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great if I\u2019m inside a nice metal shell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way we came in is blocked. I\u2019m not seeing any options here.\u201d</p><p>Neither was Andra. Shit. She so didn\u2019t want to do this. \u201cUp it is. Hold on.\u201d</p><p>Paul slid his hand around her nape, locking them together, freeing more of his power to flow into her. Sibyl clung to her waist and Andra held on to Paul\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this,\u201d she muttered before she put all her focus into the task at hand.</p><p>Energy poured out of Paul, leaping to her command. She let the bubble shrink until they were nose to nose with hungry monsters. She had to close her eyes to block them out so she could concentrate, but she somehow figured out how to use a burst of strength to push the bubble off the ground. She didn\u2019t make it far, and they kind of rolled around inside the bottom of the sphere, but it lifted, giving her the confidence that this might actually work.</p><p>She pushed harder, and one by one, the monsters started sliding off the smooth shield, making it lighter and easier to move. A few still clung to it with insectoid legs, but she couldn\u2019t help that.</p><p>The ceiling was coming at them fast now, and she couldn\u2019t figure out how to slow down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to break through,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s too much rock overhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Sibyl. \u201cWe\u2019re only a few feet down.\u201d</p><p>A few feet. She could do that if that was what it took to get Sibyl and Paul to safety. To get her sister\u2019s body into the empty grave next to her mother\u2019s.</p><p>Andra looked up at the rock, searching for a weak spot. A single crevice ran the length of the room across one corner, so she aimed for that. She formed a wedge out of air, much like the shield bubble, hardened it with her mind, and shoved the thing into the crack.</p><p>Her body vibrated under the strain, and her eyes felt like they were going to evaporate under the heat pouring out of her. At some point she\u2019d stopped sweating, or maybe it was just drying faster than her body could form it. Whatever the case, she figured she had another few seconds before she passed out completely and they all landed in the writhing mass of teeth and claws below.</p><p>She was not going to let it end like that.</p><p>White spots formed in her vision, making it hard to see, but she could feel Paul\u2019s breath at her ear as he spoke to her. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great. Just a little more.\u201d</p><p>He was pushing energy into her now, helping her as much as he could. She gathered it, holding on to it until the pressure was too much for her to take. She could hardly see now, just barely enough to make out the spot where she\u2019d shoved the wedge.</p><p>Andra let loose, hammering that spot with the force of a battering ram. Rocks rained down on them, and beneath the rumble of stone, she could hear the painful screams of the monsters below as they were crushed. The bubble held, protecting them from the big chunks, but grains of sand started making it through. The shield was getting weaker, and it wasn\u2019t going to hold for much longer.</p><p>\u201cOne more time,\u201d panted Paul. He sounded winded.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see him now. She couldn\u2019t see anything. She let instinct guide her as she gathered her strength and hammered at the wedge again. Another fall of rock cascaded down.

She wasn\u2019t sure if she was out of the hole in the cave or not until she felt Paul\u2019s triumph singing through their link.</p> <p>She drove the bubble sideways, making sure they didn\u2019t fall back down into the hole once the bubble popped.</p><p>We\u2019re safe. You can let go now.</p><p>It was Paul\u2019s voice in her head\u2014his comforting presence\u2014so she let go. They landed with a thump. Andra sucked in huge gulps of air and lay in the cool grass. Her heart hammered inside her, slowing with each beat. She could feel Paul\u2019s fingers lace through hers and reveled in the pride radiating out from him. She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d gotten them all out alive.</p><p>And then his presence was gone as if someone had flipped a switch. She reached out for him in her mind, but slammed into a wall. He wasn\u2019t there. She was alone again.</p><p>The luceria opened and slid from her neck into the grass. She tried to reach for it, but her arms didn\u2019t work. Nothing worked. Everything was broken now, and Paul was gone.</p> <p>The world faded away and there wasn\u2019t a thing she could do to stop it.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Paul had expected there to be pain. He saw the luceria fall. He\u2019d braced himself for the agony he knew was coming, but nothing happened. Andra had used so much of his power that it no longer pounded at his insides, trying to tear him apart.</p><p>He was going to die, but at least he wouldn\u2019t be in quite so much pain. He was thankful for that.</p><p>Paul gathered her in his arms and held her while her body recovered. The other Theronai had found them and were running this way. He saw Gilda, along with the others who had gone down there with him. They were safe. A little dusty, but safe.</p><p>Paul bowed his head in relief. Everyone had made it out alive. They had rescued Sibyl, and the remains of Andra\u2019s sister were safely stowed in his duffel bag. All in all, it was a total success. Too bad he didn\u2019t feel like celebrating.</p> <p>Helen bent down and checked Andra\u2019s pulse. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Just overload.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Angus crushing his daughter in a desperate hug. Gilda hung back, watching, wringing her hands as if she were itching to join in. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI know what that\u2019s like,\u201d said Helen. She reached into the grass and picked up the luceria. \u201cLooks like she lost this.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s hand shook when he took it from her. Colors swirled inside the band, still more blue than anything, but not completely.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even stand to give him another week. Only one hour. As much as he\u2019d hoped for more, he understood. He\u2019d made mistakes with her\u2014unforgivable ones. He didn\u2019t deserve another week and he knew it. So did she.</p><p>He fastened the luceria around his neck and felt the first leaf fall from his lifemark. It fluttered down over his ribs, and before it had stopped falling, another joined it. Then another.</p><p>Living until sunrise might have been an optimistic estimate. At this rate, he\u2019d have only a few hours at most.</p> <p>He wanted to spend them with Andra, as selfish as that was. He swore to himself he wouldn\u2019t let her watch him die, but he ached to be with her just a little longer.</p><p>He had only a few moments before his soul would begin to fade and he\u2019d have to leave her. He couldn\u2019t trust himself not to force her to take his luceria again. He couldn\u2019t trust himself not to hurt her or try to enslave her as he had before. He wanted forever with her too much to risk it. She\u2019d be safer if he went to meet his fate as he\u2019d been planning to do for decades.</p><p>He picked her up and followed the men to the vehicles. Even smudged with dirt and pale from exertion, she was still beautiful in the moonlight. He was a lucky man to have known her, even if it had been for only a few days.</p><p>A few days with Andra was worth more to him than a lifetime with any other woman.</p><p>Andra felt hungover. Her head pounded, her throat was sore, and she was pretty sure she was going to puke. That was the thought that got her moving enough to sit up. She didn\u2019t want to get sick in her bed.</p><p>As she sat up, she quickly realized that she wasn\u2019t in her bed. She was in a car outside of that nasty cave. The doors were open and a warm summer breeze slid over her skin. Morgan and Madoc stood guard not far away, scanning the area, speaking too low for her to hear.</p><p>The whole night came flooding back to her. She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d gotten them out safely.</p><p>She\u2019d found her baby sister, too. After eight years, she could finally lay Tori to rest.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes as she leaned down and unzipped the duffel bag. The tattered pink nightgown was no more than shreds now. The bones inside it were dusty, and she couldn\u2019t bring herself to touch them. This was Tori\u2019s body, but it wasn\u2019t all that she left behind. She\u2019d brought joy to everyone around her. She\u2019d given Andra more good memories than one person deserved to have. She hadn\u2019t lived long, but the years she\u2019d had had been good ones, and she\u2019d used them to spill more love out into the world than anyone else Andra had ever known.</p><p>Andra\u2019s tears dripped onto the red bag, leaving behind dark spots. \u201cLove you, baby,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou can rest now.\u201d</p><p>With that, Andra zipped the bag closed and put the past behind her. Tori wouldn\u2019t have wanted her to be sad. She would have wanted her to live and laugh and love.</p><p>Paul.</p><p>He was nowhere around, but when she stepped over the bag to get out and find him, she saw the glint of metal. His sword was sheathed, lying under Tori\u2019s bones on the floorboards of the SUV.</p><p>He never went anywhere without it. Why would he have left it behind?</p><p>Unless he wasn\u2019t coming back.</p><p>Andra started to panic and reached out for him so she could find him, but there was nothing there. Her hand flew to her throat and only bare skin greeted her. The luceria was gone. Their time was over.</p><p>He\u2019d left her. But why?</p><p>She scrambled from the vehicle and her legs gave out on her. She fell to the concrete and her palms burned from the impact. Madoc rushed to her and helped her up.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was here just a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Andra pointed at the sword. \u201cHe left it behind. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>Madoc watched her, his face expressionless. \u201cHe went to die.\u201d</p><p>Morgan elbowed him in the ribs. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to talk about it. Where the hell is your honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck honor,\u201d growled Madoc. \u201cShe deserves to know the score.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he hid it from her,\u201d said Morgan, \u201cit was because that was his choice. He didn\u2019t want her to know what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned silent for a long second, then looked at Madoc. \u201cWhat exactly is he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to go take out a bunch of Synestryn on their way back into the cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what? Why the hell would he . . . ?\u201d She didn\u2019t have time for that. She\u2019d beat it out of Paul when she found him. \u201cWhich way did he go?\u201d</p><p>Madoc knew. She could see it in his eyes.</p><p>Andra grabbed him by the shirt and gave him a shake. He was too big for her to rock him much, but he got the point. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d</p><p>Madoc\u2019s green eyes flicked to the right, toward a thick growth of trees. \u201cSun\u2019s almost up and he\u2019s been gone long enough to do the job. You won\u2019t find him in time.\u201d</p><p>The hell she wouldn\u2019t. She grabbed Madoc\u2019s cell phone off his belt and ran as she scrolled through his phone book. Her legs were wobbly, but they held because this was important.</p><p>The phone rang, but he didn\u2019t pick up. She didn\u2019t bother leaving a voice mail. She just dialed again. Finally, on the fourth try, he picked up.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, man,\u201d growled Paul.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He clearly hadn\u2019t expected it to be her on the line. \u201cThey told you, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m not going to let you do it.\u201d She was panting, barely able to make the words come out.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a choice, Andra. I\u2019m not going to let myself live long enough for my soul to die. I want you so much, I\u2019d hurt you.\u201d He sucked in a hissing breath.</p><p>\u201cI already lost Mom and Tori. I can\u2019t lose you, too.\u201d The mere thought was tearing her apart. She\u2019d already lost too much. She deserved to have a little happiness for a change.</p><p>She plunged into the woods, using instinct to guide her. She wished she still had that connection to him\u2014that she could hunt him down with her mind.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have you tied to me out of obligation,\u201d he said. His voice was growing weaker.</p><p>She had no idea what he meant. \u201cWhat obligation? Love is never an obligation.\u201d</p><p>Brush and low limbs slashed at her face, but she pushed forward.</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d he asked, his voice lifting with hope.</p><p>Normally, she would have pulled back and put some distance between them. This was all way too fast, and she still had responsibilities that had to come first. Loving anyone was going to be a huge complication, not to mention the fact that if she admitted it, there would be no more hiding. No more lying to herself.</p><p>If she loved him, he could hurt her. If she loved him and he died, she\u2019d never recover.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she whispered, though whether it was because she was out of breath or because she feared saying it too loud, she wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d known. Too late now.\u201d</p><p>He let out a deep groan of pain. She could hear it nearby, and a split second later, it echoed over the phone. He was close.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cLove . . . you . . . too.\u201d The words were so faint she could hardly hear them.</p><p>She saw a glimpse of blue that didn\u2019t belong in the forest. She wished like hell she had magic eyes again to help her see. The pink light of impending dawn was barely enough to guide her.</p><p>As she got nearer, she saw that the blue was his jeans. She\u2019d found him.</p><p>Andra tumbled through the trees and fell at his side. He was leaning against a thick trunk, slumped and unmoving. Synestryn corpses littered the ground a few feet away. Dozens of them. Several deep gashes in Paul\u2019s flesh leaked red blood. His skin was growing paler by the second. His chest was bare, his shirt slit open along the right side where claws had torn it apart, along with his skin.</p><p>The tattoo over his chest was bare. All the leaves were dead, lying in a heap along his waist.</p><p>The luceria swirled with color, but that was fading fast.</p><p>Praying it wasn\u2019t too late, she yanked the thing off his neck and fastened it around her own. The ends locked together, but nothing else happened. She still couldn\u2019t feel him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t breathing.</p><p>Panic made her tremble. She pressed her fingers to the side of his neck, trying to feel a pulse. It was faint and she wasn\u2019t totally sure that it hadn\u2019t been her own, but it gave her hope. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laid his body flat, heedless of the bloody leaves and sticks littering the ground, and breathed into his mouth. His chest expanded. She did it again and again.</p><p>Then she felt it. A spark of power arcing between their mouths. He was still with her. She could feel him fighting his way back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave me,\u201d she told him. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>The pool of power inside him was weak, but she si-phoned off what she could and used it to knit his skin back together. She didn\u2019t know what she was doing, but she had to try something to keep him from bleeding out.</p> <p>She covered his mouth with hers to breathe for him again, but this time he didn\u2019t need any help. He pulled the air from her lungs and kissed her in return.</p><p>His tongue slid over her lips and a low moan of pleasure vibrated in his chest. He tasted so good. So alive. Her heart overflowed with relief and gratitude.</p><p>His arms wrapped around her and he sat them both up. His mouth left hers and she could see his eyes blazing with emotion. \u201cTell me again,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She knew what he wanted to hear. She could feel the hint of insecurity still lingering inside of him, and she loved him so much, she couldn\u2019t deny him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes fluttered closed in pleasure. \u201cGod, that sounds good.\u201d</p> <p>He grabbed his borrowed sword from where it had landed in the leaves, knelt in front of her, and sliced a shallow cut over his heart. \u201cMy life for yours, Andra. Forever and always.\u201d</p><p>Blood dripped down his chest, making her already twisty stomach twist harder. \u201cI really wish you would stop doing that. I just patched you up.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her complaint and looked at her with such intensity she wanted to look away. \u201cGive me your vow. I need it.\u201d</p><p>He needed her. Forever. That was what he wanted, and it scared the hell out of her.</p><p>Even so, even though she was afraid to tie him to a woman who made so many mistakes, she was more afraid of letting him go. He\u2019d seen all her failures. He knew she\u2019d let a lot of people she loved down. He knew she\u2019d let them die. And still he wanted her. Trusted her.</p><p>It humbled her and yet also gave her the strength to trust herself. She wasn\u2019t perfect, but she didn\u2019t have to be. He would always be there for her when she was weak. He would always be there for her, period.</p> <p>\u201cI need you, too. So, as long as you don\u2019t get sick of me, I\u2019ll be right there by your side.\u201d</p><p>As the warmth of her promise settled over her, a smile of masculine satisfaction curled his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re mine now, Andra, because I\u2019m never going to get sick of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should rephrase my vow, then,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. I\u2019ve got you right where I want you. Forever.\u201d He pulled her close and bent his head to kiss her just as the first rays of sunrise broke through the trees.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>Andra held her breath. Sibyl stood by Nika\u2019s bed. Tynan had used all the power he\u2019d collected to heal those injured in the attack on Dabyr and had none left to help Nika, at least not for another week, so Sibyl was Nika\u2019s best chance right now.</p><p>Paul was at her side, his strong arm around her. His thumb caressed her waist, soothing some of the tension that had been growing in her since they\u2019d arrived home.</p><p>And Dabyr was home now, as strange a place as it was.</p> <p>Sibyl frowned and pressed her little hand to Nika\u2019s forehead. A moment later, she pulled back as if burned.</p><p>\u201cPoor child,\u201d said Sibyl. \u201cIf she is to recover, it will not be by your hand.\u201d</p><p>Andra leaned against Paul, weak with disappointment. He held her up, solid and unyielding. \u201cWhat do you mean? Isn\u2019t there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>Frustration burned bright inside her. She felt helpless. Even with all the power she possessed now, she still couldn\u2019t help Nika.</p><p>\u201cThere is hope, though,\u201d said Sibyl. \u201cYou rescued me, so I will offer you this boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Any hope you can give me is more than welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is one here who can heal her. I cannot see who he is, but I feel that he\u2019s already begun the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe? So, not Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not Grace. She is a healing soul, and gives Nika great comfort, but that is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do I do?\u201d asked Andra.</p><p>Sibyl gave her a smile full of more wisdom than any eight-year-old should possess. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done all you can. You brought her here. That will either be enough or it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t tell. It is no longer my turn.\u201d</p><p>Andra was trying to figure out what she meant, but she was having a hard time keeping up with all the cryp tic stuff. \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s not your turn?\u201d</p><p>Sibyl tilted her head, making her curls bob. \u201cYou are a sister. You know what it is like to have to share. Didn\u2019t you ever learn to take turns?\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s body tensed beside her. \u201cAre you saying that Maura can see things the way you can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said nothing of the sort. That would be against the rules.\u201d She turned and left, but stopped at the door. Without turning around, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be happy together. I don\u2019t have to break any rules to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>After she was gone, the room seemed oddly empty. \u201cO-kay,\u201d said Paul. \u201cThere are clearly some things I still don\u2019t know around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club. Holy cow, that girl is freaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to her,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019m going to have to, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He bent and kissed the side of her neck, making her skin heat. His arms felt good around her. She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d ever survived without him. He was so much a part of her that she could hardly tell the difference between his presence inside her mind and her own.</p><p>His tongue slid down until it touched the edge of her luceria. As soon as it did, it wasn\u2019t just her skin that was hot. She was melting inside, only for him.</p><p>His wicked smile told her he knew it, too. \u201cYes, you are, because I\u2019m never going to let you go.\u201d</p><p>Nika woke up suddenly, as if someone had shouted her name. The woman in the corner of her room had fallen asleep with a half-knitted sweater in her lap. Nika didn\u2019t recognize her, but she wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><p>For the first time in eight years, she wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><p>The feeling made her giddy, and even though her body was weak, she rose from her bed and left all that weak flesh behind. She had to go now.</p><p>It took her a moment to get used to the buoyant feeling of being outside her body. She was so used to the gnawing hunger and deep aches that the loss of both unnerved her, almost made her lonely for their constant companionship. Nika looked back at the bed where her shell lay. She didn\u2019t recognize that person. That skeleton.</p><p>Once again she felt a shock of recognition, as if someone had called her name.</p><p>She had to go to him. He needed her.</p><p>Nika slipped out of the room, through the front door, and into a long hallway. She didn\u2019t know where she was, but she knew where she was going. Instincts guided her like an arrow, and she raced along the dark, deserted hallways, floating above the floor.</p><p>She was close now. She could feel him\u2014feel his power. She\u2019d found her home, though she had no idea how she knew that was the case.</p><p>The door looked like all the others, but to her, it seethed with power. She pressed her hands against it and they slipped through the wood easily. He was in there. Sleeping.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to wake him. He needed his rest; it was the only time he escaped his pain. She didn\u2019t want him to hurt. That was why she needed to be near him. To soothe him. To take away his pain.</p><p>Nika glided through the door into a suite that looked much like the one she\u2019d just left, but only on the surface. This place was a house of pain and torment. It was a house of sorrow and desperation. Even so, it was the most comforting place she\u2019d ever been because he was here.</p><p>When she floated into his room and drifted onto his bed, he didn\u2019t wake. She wasn\u2019t even sure whether he could feel her or not, but she snuggled close to his side and draped her body over his. Warmth from his naked skin rose up to her, driving away the constant chill in her limbs.</p><p>As if sensing her need for warmth, he shifted in his sleep. He wrapped a thick arm around her body, pinning her in place with a heavy thigh. He didn\u2019t pass through her. It was as if he were the only real thing within this ethereal world.</p><p>Her spirit was surrounded by his heat, his scent.</p><p>This was what she needed. He was what she needed. He scared away the terror that haunted her. Even the vilest of creatures trembled before him. As long as she was with him, they couldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>Lexi was here. Zach felt her appear as if she\u2019d walked through a portal into Dabyr.</p><p>He sprang from the weight bench and raced through the halls toward her. He wasn\u2019t going to lose her this time. Not again.</p><p>He turned a corner and threw himself at Drake\u2019s door, slamming into it. The thing shook, but didn\u2019t go down. She was in there. He had to get to her before she disappeared again.</p><p>Zach had just lifted his foot to kick the door down when it opened. Drake stared at him like he\u2019d lost his mind, filling the doorway so none of Zach\u2019s craziness could spill over onto his beloved Helen.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cHelen\u2019s on the phone. What the hell do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Helen. Lexi. She\u2019s in there. You\u2019re hiding her.\u201d Zach shoved his way inside, but Drake kept his body between him and Helen.</p><p>She came out of the kitchen with her cell phone to her ear. When she saw him, her face drained of all color. She put her finger to her lips for silence and said into the phone, \u201cNo, Lexi, it\u2019s fine. No one\u2019s hurting me.\u201d</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t here. She was on the phone.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>It took Zach a long moment to recover from the crushing disappointment. She wasn\u2019t here. He couldn\u2019t see her. Touch her. He couldn\u2019t take care of her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t paddle her ass for running away from him.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Helen. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about these people. I don\u2019t know what your mother told you, but she was wrong, too. They\u2019re the good guys.\u201d</p><p>Zach glared at Drake for standing in his way. \u201cLet me talk to her,\u201d he told Helen.</p><p>Helen\u2019s eyes widened and she shook her head, making her braids sway. \u201cAt least let me meet you somewhere and talk to you. I swear I\u2019ll come alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell you will,\u201d said both Drake and Zach at the same time.</p><p>Zach used the momentary distraction to reach past Drake and take the phone out of Helen\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHello, honey,\u201d he said, struggling to keep his voice calm when all he really wanted to do was scream at Lexi for abandoning him.</p><p>\u201cZach.\u201d Fear filled her voice, but it couldn\u2019t disguise the fatigue that flowed through that single word.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPhoenix. Or maybe it\u2019s Madison. I get the two confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough with the smart-ass routine. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere safe. Somewhere you and your monsters will never find me.\u201d</p><p>He clutched the plastic so hard it creaked in his grip. Anger pumped through him along with something else\u2014something needy and desperate and afraid. \u201cWhere are you, honey? I need to come find you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word wasn\u2019t as forceful as she\u2019d probably meant it to be.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Lexi. I need you.\u201d His voice was so full of pleading that Drake looked at him funny, but he didn\u2019t give a shit. He was beyond pride.</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re trying to trick me again. It won\u2019t happen. And I swear to God that if you harm a hair on Helen\u2019s head, I\u2019ll hunt you down myself and choke you with your own balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d never hurt Helen. She\u2019s one of us now.\u201d</p><p>A choking sob filled the line. \u201cOh, God. What have you done to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve given her a home. A family. We protect her and keep her safe. And we want to do the same for you, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar! Mom said you all lied as well as Satan himself. Now I know she was right. About all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what she told you, but none of us would ever hurt you. Just let me meet you. Talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll try to abduct me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he lied.</p><p>Another soft sob filtered through their connection, breaking his heart. She was in pain. Suffering. Tired. Everything inside him screamed for him to go to her, but he didn\u2019t know where to go. \u201cPlease, Lexi. Give me a chance. I want to help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish that were true, Zach. God, do I wish that were true. I\u2019m in so much trouble. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a loud banging sound on her end of the line. Panic raced through Zach, making him reach for his sword. \u201cLexi? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cI gotta go. They\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is there? And where the fuck are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot who. What. The monsters have found me again.\u201d</p><p>Monsters? She meant Synestryn.</p><p>Another loud boom filled the line.</p><p>Zach raced out of the suite toward the garage. \u201cLexi. Tell me where you are. I\u2019m coming to help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou already know where I am. You sent them.\u201d</p><p>His heart was pounding so hard, he could barely speak. \u201cNo, honey. I didn\u2019t. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. Another loud boom was followed by a crashing sound, like glass breaking. \u201cTexas,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDenton, Texas.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead.</p><p>\u201cLexi!\u201d screamed Zach into the phone, but it did no good. She was already gone.</p><p>He heard Drake\u2019s heavy steps behind him as he raced out of the suite and down the hall, but he didn\u2019t slow. He jumped into his SUV and screeched out of the compound garage, down the long driveway. If the gate wasn\u2019t open by the time he got there, he was going to blow through it. </p> </body></html>"]
