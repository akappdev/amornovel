Since he was on leave from the U.S. Marshals Service office in Albuquerque, the only calls he would be receiving were in his capacity as a Special Operations Group deputy. As such, he was a last resort and on call twenty-four hours a day. His twelve-man response team was activated only after the shit had already hit the fan.</p><p>There were a lot of emotions that filtered through Jack when he was called in, but relief wasn\u2019t usually one them. Right now, however, he\u2019d give just about anything for an excuse to head in the opposite direction.</p><p>His fellow deputies would laugh if they knew how edgy he was getting with every mile that passed. As a SOG deputy marshal\u2014a Shadow Stalker\u2014he squared off with hardened criminals and suicidal terrorists as a matter of course. He hunted and apprehended the country\u2019s most-wanted fugitives. He did his job with mechanical precision, never breaking a sweat. The guys called him \u201cIron Jack,\u201d the man who\u2019d do anything. He faced death as if he had nothing to lose or nothing to live for.</p><p>Yet the thought of facing Rachel Tse was shredding him.</p> <p>\u201cKilligrew,\u201d he answered via the hands-free Bluetooth control in his steering wheel. He\u2019d already noted the lack of a shoulder on the two-lane road. With agricultural fields on each side of him, turning his long Chevy Silverado around wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d</p><p>Christ. The voice on the other end of the line reverberated through him like a gunshot report.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d he replied gruffly, slowly recovering from the husky sound of her voice. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She said the word breathlessly, which made him hard. \u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d be here in time for lunch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLunch?\u201d God, he was screwed. His best friend\u2019s widow was winded from pulling together a birthday party for his eight-year-old godson and he was getting a boner.</p><p>It had been two years since he\u2019d last seen her, but apparently time didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d put off this reunion as long as he could, but the time had come to deal with it. Steve\u2019s last request had eaten into him far enough to become hazardous. Jack couldn\u2019t allow his own personal crap to jeopardize his team any more than it already had.</p><p>\u201cJack? Did I lose you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. I was just calculating the possibility of my arriving in time for lunch. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, as if she sensed the lie.</p><p>He hated bullshitting her, but he couldn\u2019t see her today. He needed time to get his head on straight. He hadn\u2019t taken a leave of absence in years and without work to occupy him, he found himself thinking too damn much about her. Visions of her blond hair fisted in his hands . . . her taut, sweet nipples tightening against his tongue . . . her long, lithe legs spreading in invitation . . .</p> <p>Getting that obsession under control was a necessity if he had any hope of convincing her she was off the hook as far as he was concerned. He was still reeling from Steve\u2019s request that he look after her if she was ever left alone. Jack realized his friend must have known how he felt. As careful as he\u2019d been to hide his longing, something must have betrayed him.</p><p>And that killed him. No man should have to deal with knowing his best friend is in love with his wife.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t reached King City yet.\u201d Jack had passed King City long ago and was about twenty minutes away from Monterey. He would pick up the keys to his cottage in Carmel from the property managers who rented it out for him, then grab a six-pack of beer and hunker down for the night. He\u2019d get his bearings and be better capable of facing her in the morning.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make it dinner, then. Riley\u2019s spending the night at a friend\u2019s house so I can wrap his gifts without him peeking. It\u2019ll be just you and me. We can catch up.\u201d</p><p>Just her and him. At night. With Riley gone until morning? Yeah, right. Jack could imagine the mess running through Rachel\u2019s head now. She\u2019d been crazy about Steve. Madly in love. If she thought Steve wanted them together, she\u2019d make it work, even though he scared the shit out of her. Part of his job was reading people, and as focused on her as his instincts were, there wasn\u2019t a damn thing about her he didn\u2019t register. When he walked into the room, she became skittish\u2014nostrils flaring, eyes widening, body moving restlessly. Her primal reaction aroused every predatory sense in his body, making him edgy and sharpening his hunger for her.</p><p>\u201cHow about I take you two out to breakfast in the morning?\u201d His voice was rough with desire. \u201cThen I\u2019ll help you finish setting up for his party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But if you make it into town sooner, call me. And be careful on the road.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a casual warning for Rachel. Steve had been killed by a drunk driver on the way home from work one night, changing all of their lives forever.</p><p>Jack hung up. Shifting on the seat, he adjusted the fit of his jeans, which was now extremely uncomfortable. Ahead of him, the road to perdition wound its way through the tiny town of Spreckles.</p><p>It was going to be a long week.</p><p>two</p><p>Jack twisted off the top of his fourth beer and tossed the metal cap in the trash. Then he headed back out the open sliding glass doors to his small fenced-in patio. His bare feet sank into the sand and he drank deeply, absently admiring the streaks of orange and pink flaring across the sky. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the temperature fell along with it. It was much cooler here than Albuquerque, but thoughts of Rachel kept him warm enough to go shirtless.</p><p>He was beginning to think drinking had been a bad idea. The alcohol wasn\u2019t smoothing the jagged edges of his lust at all. He was acutely aware of the fact that Rachel was home alone right now and he was only a short drive away. If he left now, he could be inside her within thirty minutes. He had no doubt he could seduce her. He also had no doubt that she\u2019d regret it in the morning.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t her fault he was strung out from wanting her. She\u2019d never led him on or enticed him. Rachel was shy and quiet unless she was surrounded by people she felt comfortable with, an aftereffect of being raised by an aunt who reminded her daily what a burden she was. At least in his childhood, when he made himself invisible, he\u2019d been left alone. She had been verbally abused and tormented no matter what she\u2019d done.</p><p>His cell phone rang and he cursed as he withdrew it from his pocket. The caller ID told him it was Brian Simmons, a fellow deputy and a guy who\u2019d saved Jack\u2019s ass more than once.</p><p>\u201cKilligrew,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cSo, have you seen her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, that would have been my first stop. She owns a cake shop; she might be huge and your problem would be solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley e-mails me pictures. No such luck.\u201d And the fact was, Jack doubted it would make a difference to him if she had put on weight. He was attracted to the whole package, not just her looks. Besides, a few weeks sharing his bed would take care of any extra pounds.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, you should think about what you\u2019re throwing away. First off, there are those cupcakes of hers. If she stops sending them, the guys might have to hurt you. Second, I\u2019d give anything to be with Layla right now. It kills me knowing she\u2019s out there somewhere in WitSec\u2014hopefully, still in love with me\u2014and I can\u2019t have her. You don\u2019t have that problem; you\u2019ve got permission. And although I haven\u2019t seen much evidence of it, I\u2019m sure you must have some charm to you. Lay it on her and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>Jack knew he wasn\u2019t what Rachel needed. He had nothing to offer her. Steve had a large extended family that enfolded her with open arms; Jack had only his job, and her and Riley. Steve was the steady and dependable type, a chiropractor who\u2019d come home for dinner every night and was there for breakfast in the morning; Jack never knew when he\u2019d be leaving or when he could come back. Rachel had lived with enough neglect and abandonment as a child. She didn\u2019t need it in her adult life as well.</p><p>\u201cShe deserves better than me,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Against his determination to be in a shitty mood, Jack\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cFuck you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame to you.\u201d Jack shoved his phone back in his pocket and was lifting his beer to his lips when he heard a car door shut in what sounded like his driveway.</p><p>Pivoting in the sand, he canvassed the public beach just beyond his short picket fence. His attention narrowed on the side of his house just before a lipstick red dress rounded the corner. The slender body it encased caught his eye next and held it.</p><p>\u201cI guessed you\u2019d be out here,\u201d Rachel said, waving. She headed toward the gate with a square cake pan in one hand.</p><p>Jack wanted to do the gentlemanly thing and let her in, but he couldn\u2019t move. She\u2019d cut her hair short and wore it in sexy, tousled curls that exposed her slender neck and emphasized her fine-boned features. As she passed by him, he saw the back\u2014or, rather, lack of a back\u2014to her dress. Held up by thin straps, the material dipped down to the upper swell of her buttocks, betraying the lack of a bra.</p><p>Jesus. She\u2019d lost her mind coming around him dressed like that.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked without finesse, his gut aching from a soul-deep longing. He rubbed at the center of his chest with the bottom edge of his bottle but found no relief.</p><p>\u201cYou said no to lunch and dinner but didn\u2019t decline dessert.\u201d</p><p>She came through the gate, her long legs on display thanks to the short skirt and two-inch slit at her right thigh. There was no hesitation in her approach, which changed the rules of engagement. She\u2019d never outright avoided him, but she hadn\u2019t gone out of her way to be near him either.</p><p>Lifting onto her tiptoes, she balanced herself with a hand over his heart and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek. \u201cYou look fabulous, Jack,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack wondered if she was aware of the soft note of invitation in her words or how it made his heart race beneath her palm. He didn\u2019t want her under a sense of obligation. He didn\u2019t want to be the tie that bound her to memories of her past with Steve. And he sure as hell didn\u2019t want her martyring herself in his bed.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she went on, stepping back, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure you\u2019re happy to see me.\u201d</p><p>He took the opportunity to breathe, sucking in the salt-tinged air in an effort to clear his head. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised but in a good way.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel smiled. Her fingertips slid down his arm to his wrist, then circled the neck of his beer bottle. She tugged it loose and took a long pull, her lips wrapped around the top and her throat working with each swallow.</p><p>His mind fell straight into the gutter.</p><p>He turned as she skirted him and went into the house. He hadn\u2019t bothered to turn the lights on and she didn\u2019t, either. Instead, she used the fading sun as a guide to reach the kitchen island. A moment later a flare in the shadows preceded the igniting of a candlewick. The property management company had scattered groupings of seashell-covered candles all over the house, part of the nautical theme they\u2019d utilized throughout.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten how charming this place is,\u201d she called out to him.</p><p>Jack debated the wisdom of following her inside, knowing the leash on his hunger was tenuous at best. \u201cI can\u2019t take credit for it. It\u2019s staged by professionals to appeal to the vacation renters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d reserve more time here for yourself.\u201d She lit another candle. \u201cWe\u2019d love to see you more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d Knowing it would be ridiculous to keep shouting at her from outside, Jack entered the living room. \u201cI\u2019d like to start spending more time with Riley, now that he\u2019s older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d love that.\u201d Turning away from him, she searched the cupboards.</p><p>\u201cThe plates are to the left of the fridge,\u201d he directed. He watched the way the hem of her skirt lifted a couple tantalizing inches as she reached upward. Feeling like a randy dog, he looked away, then couldn\u2019t resist looking back again. \u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d</p><p>She looked over her shoulder and her mouth curved. \u201cBetter Than Sex cake.\u201d</p><p>Jack searched for a sign that she was joking. \u201cWhoever came up with that doesn\u2019t get out much.\u201d</p> <p>Her laughter hit him like a punch to the gut. He\u2019d always loved that carefree sound. It said so much about her. She made him laugh, too, with her e-mailed stories about hysterical run-ins with customers. He\u2019d startled his fellow deputies more than once by laughing aloud at something she sent him. She brought light into his life, which made him even more aware of the darkness he could bring into hers.</p><p>It figured he would fall for the one woman he was the worst possible fit for.</p><p>Kicking off her low-heeled sandals by the island, she padded over with a single plate in her hand. \u201cI make a cupcake-sized version of this at the store. It\u2019s one of my most popular flavors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you make is popular. You\u2019re an awesome cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I can\u2019t grill, though, so I\u2019m relying on you to handle the hot dogs and burgers tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me to work. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>One dirty blond brow rose with challenge. \u201cDon\u2019t complain later when I take you up on that.\u201d</p><p>Again, there was a suggestive undertone to her words. He forced his gaze away and down at the cake, noting what looked to be caramel drizzle over the top. He wanted to drizzle caramel all over her body and tongue it off slowly. Endlessly. Licking through it to the sweeter flesh beneath.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d She stabbed at the cake with the fork in her hand and lifted a bite to his lips.</p><p>He opened his mouth. The cake was rich but not too rich. \u201cVery good,\u201d he praised, happy to see her cheeks flush with pleasure. \u201cBut it\u2019s not better than sex.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes sparkled with silent laughter. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>three</p><p>The tension that gripped Jack at her bold statement was so tangible Rachel felt it. She waited with bated breath, her heart skipping at the scorching look he raked her with. That sharply focused intensity had been too much for her when she\u2019d been younger.</p><p>Dear God . . . he was gorgeous. Impossibly sexy. Standing there in only button-fly jeans with the top button undone. He was leaner than she remembered, his features more angular. She bet he wasn\u2019t taking care of himself. He was likely working too hard and not eating often enough. There wasn\u2019t an ounce of extraneous flesh on him. Every muscle was clearly, deliciously defined. His arms, his pectorals, his abdomen.</p><p>He could drive a woman crazy, especially with that air of danger clinging to him. It was evident, just by looking at him, that there were very few things he wouldn\u2019t do if necessary. There were scars all over him\u2014a puckered bullet hole by his shoulder, slashing scars across his abdomen, an old burn mark on his forearm, just to name a few.</p><p>As long as Rachel had known him, he\u2019d always lived life on a razor\u2019s edge, first as a U.S. Army Ranger and now as a deputy marshal. Any woman who loved him would have to accept the hazards inherent in the work he did. His job would always be his mistress. It would pull him from his wife\u2019s bed at all hours of the night, luring him into deadly situations while the scent of his desire still clung to her skin.</p><p>Rachel hadn\u2019t believed she could ever take on a man like him, but she\u2019d underestimated her capacity to grow and change. Since she and Jack had first met, she\u2019d had a wonderful eight-year marriage. She had persevered through an ectopic pregnancy, the death of her mother and beloved husband, the launching of her own small business, and the terrifying process of learning how to be a single mother.</p><p>She was no longer the woman who\u2019d been married to Steve Tse. She was now the woman who\u2019d survived him, and they were two very different people.</p><p>The woman she was today was more than capable of tackling a challenge like Jack Killigrew. And by God, she intended to.</p><p>He finally spoke. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>Rachel wondered if he knew the impact his low, whisky-rough voice had on women. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time for me, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d He retreated. Shoving his hands through his short dark hair, he turned his back to her. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have drunk that beer.\u201d</p><p>Lord have mercy. The way he moved and spoke was intensely sensual. Just the flexing of his muscles was totally erotic.</p><p>She became even more determined to have all that virility focused on her. \u201cI don\u2019t need false courage to hit on you.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her over his shoulder. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me now. You\u2019ve stayed away for two years. A lot has changed.\u201d</p><p>Pivoting, he faced her again. \u201cI figured you and the Tses would close ranks while you dealt with Steve\u2019s death. I stayed out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Rachel set the plate and fork down on the glass-topped end table. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that\u2019s why you\u2019ve been so distant. I thought maybe it was me.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched and she knew she\u2019d struck a cord. The confirmation hurt more than she\u2019d thought it would.</p><p>\u201cI would have asked you to be here,\u201d she said, \u201cif I could have used you. I feel comfortable doing that. Even before\u2014when Steve was still here\u2014I knew I could count on you.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou never quite got used to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re larger than life, Jack. I\u2019ve never met anyone like you before or since.\u201d Her arms crossed. The raw magnetism and intense carnality that once overwhelmed her now set her libido on a steady simmer. She hadn\u2019t realized until she started dating again that she was comparing her dates to Jack and finding they left her cold. \u201cYou are rarely entirely comfortable with me, either,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cSo why do this? Why ask me this?\u201d</p><p>Rachel was confused. He was looking at her like he wanted to nail her to the nearest wall, but he sounded like that was the last thing he was interested in. \u201cHave you looked in a mirror lately? Do you hear the sound of your voice, all gravelly and sexy as hell? Are you completely oblivious to the bad-boy vibe you give off? Because I\u2019m not blind or deaf.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s dark and steady gaze was knife-sharp. His brows were drawn together in a fearsome glower, but she wasn\u2019t intimidated. She was quickly picking up on the fact that he became the most fierce when his equanimity was threatened. Which meant, for better or worse, she got to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re physically attracted to me,\u201d she said, daring him to deny it. \u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>He mimicked her pose, crossing his arms and displaying powerful biceps. \u201cI\u2019m flattered, but we\u2019ve got too much baggage\u2014and a future with Riley between us\u2014to make casual sex work.\u201d</p><p>Why would anything casual delve into baggage?</p><p>She looked away, hiding the spark of hope she felt. Jack knew damn well there was nothing casual about the sexual tension between them, and that scared him. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t be the first drop-dead gorgeous guy to have commitment issues. In all the years she\u2019d known him, he had never once had a steady relationship. If an event required a date, he\u2019d bring one, but Rachel never saw him with the same woman more than once.</p><p>Needing to think, she picked up the plate and moved back to the kitchen. She took a bite of the cake and contemplated her next move. This was her first-ever seduction; she had no Plan B to fall back on. Giving up wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice was soft in the semi-darkness.</p><p>She ate a little more. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got awfully quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled harshly, his head falling back until he was staring at the white-washed wooden beam ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m sure if you gave dating a shot, you\u2019d find someone you liked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d She spoke around another bite. She had long admired his fierce loyalty, but over the last two years since Steve passed on, she\u2019d come to know Jack even better via his role as Riley\u2019s godfather. Through the e-mails and phone calls he shared with her son, she discovered Jack possessed a deep capacity to love and nurture, a marked patience while teaching, and the ability to be open-minded and nonjudgmental. And she damn well couldn\u2019t discount how just the sound of his voice turned her on. \u201cBut I have been dating.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His head snapped upright. \u201cWho? Do I know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I care. I want to make sure you and Riley are all right.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel met his gaze directly. \u201cI would never put Riley in jeopardy over a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him surreptitiously, noting his edginess while she felt amazingly calm. He made her feel safe enough to be bold. He didn\u2019t yet know what that meant to her, but she intended to show him.</p><p>Jack moved toward the open sliding glass door. \u201cWhat you and Steve had was special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce in a lifetime,\u201d she agreed. She\u2019d been the right girl to Steve\u2019s right guy at the right time. And she felt that way about Jack. She was so sure they were what each other needed; it didn\u2019t seem possible that she could be wrong. If he just gave her a shot, maybe he\u2019d see she was the missing ingredient in his life. And if she ended up being the one in their relationship who loved the other one more, that was okay with her.</p> <p>\u201cYou just have to give it some more time. And be a little open-minded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She set her fork down. \u201cAre you giving me dating advice? No offense, but what the hell do you know about having a serious relationship?\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned his back into the doorjamb and shoved his hands in his pockets, giving her a breathtaking silhouette of long legs and firm pectorals. \u201cNothing at all. I just know Steve is going to be a hard act to follow. You might have to make some compromises, but you can be happy again. You can find a good guy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean I might have to settle.\u201d She straightened and pushed the plate away, ignoring the urge to clean up after herself. Damned if she\u2019d fall into mommy role right now. She was dressed to kill and primed. And she was playing to win, even if that meant playing a little dirty. \u201cI\u2019ve never settled on the wrong guy in my life, and I\u2019m not going to start now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell are you doing here?\u201d he said coldly.</p><p>\u201cGoing down in flames, apparently.\u201d She reached for both spaghetti straps of her dress. If he needed to believe she could handle a no-strings-attached one-night stand, she could give him that impression. Then she\u2019d work her way into him from the outside. She just had to start somewhere, and standing on opposing sides of the room wasn\u2019t cutting it. \u201cBut hey, if that\u2019s the way this is going to end, I might as well make sure I gave it my best shot.\u201d</p> <p>Flicking the thin straps off her shoulders, Rachel held her breath. Her dress slithered down her body and puddled on the floor.</p><p>four</p><p>Jack stared, stunned and aching, as Rachel went from dressed to mouthwateringly naked in a split second. He swore. His knees weakened. He was grateful to be leaning against the house. There wasn\u2019t a scrap of material on her. No bra, which he\u2019d known, and no panties to cover her waxed pussy, which he was grateful he hadn\u2019t known about or she\u2019d have been bent over the couch already.</p><p>Sucking in air like he\u2019d just run for miles, he devoured every inch of her pale body with a ravenous gaze. The proud angle of her chin and shoulders, her small but lushly curved breasts, her flat stomach, and her mile-long legs. She turned in a circle with her arms outstretched, showing off her elegantly curved spine and perky little ass.</p><p>\u201cLast call,\u201d she said, facing him again. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t catch your interest, I\u2019ll head out. You can keep the cake.\u201d</p><p>Christ, she was sassy and bold. Jack had no idea who the woman standing in front of him was. It damn sure wasn\u2019t the Rachel he remembered, a woman who\u2019d coped with her vindictive aunt by staying away from home as much as possible. Staying away from home led to her being assaulted when she was sixteen. Steve didn\u2019t elaborate and Jack hadn\u2019t pried. That one word was more than enough.</p><p>The walls started closing in. Sweat misted his skin and the knot in his gut tightened painfully. He could\u2019ve said no to the old Rachel. With this one, he was a goner.</p><p>Her seduction was the worst sort of perdition. He was terrified he was going to fuck this all up and push Rachel and Riley away, the only people he really considered his family. The people he called on holidays and sent gifts to. The people he thought of when the chips were down and he needed a reason to get his ass out alive, if worse for wear. If he lost them, he\u2019d have nothing. He\u2019d forever be worried that they might be in trouble or need something, and his assistance wouldn\u2019t be welcomed.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me here, Rachel,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s only fair.\u201d Her arms lowered to her sides. \u201cI\u2019m dying for you.\u201d</p><p>He straightened. He was going to ask her why she was here and if she said Steve\u2019s name, he was walking out to the beach and not stopping until the sun came up. If she didn\u2019t mention Steve, well . . . he couldn\u2019t turn her away. He would take her to bed and try to find some closure. He\u2019d say as much as it was possible to say, do all that it was possible to do, and somehow find a way to act in the morning like nothing had changed between them. He prayed that would ease the way for them to move forward without any awkwardness. If there was the added bonus of her feeling like she\u2019d closed the door on her past with Steve and could move forward unencumbered, he could live with that, as long as he didn\u2019t have to know about it.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d he bit out.</p><p>Her arms fell to her sides. She met his gaze head-on and said, \u201cBecause I want to be with someone I feel connected to. Someone who isn\u2019t going to fumble around and leave me hanging at the end. A man who knows his way around a woman\u2019s body and doesn\u2019t need me to tell him what I want.\u201d</p><p>That was it, then. He was a dead man walking.</p><p>Jack strode forward in a controlled rush, his focus narrowed on Rachel and his goal of getting inside her as swiftly as possible. He was highly conscious of how short a time he had with her. A lifetime wouldn\u2019t be long enough and he\u2019d been given only a handful of hours.</p><p>As he zeroed in, he could see her tremble, but her gaze didn\u2019t waver. When he caught her waist in his hands and lifted her, she gasped but didn\u2019t recoil. Instead, her slender arms wrapped around his neck and she buried her face in his throat. He was damp with perspiration, but she didn\u2019t seem to care. She nuzzled against him, her tongue darting out and licking. Impossibly, his cock swelled further. He was so hard it hurt, his dick throbbing in his jeans, demanding relief from his torment.</p><p>He headed toward the hallway leading to the bedroom, holding her partly away from him so they actually stood a chance of making it that far.</p><p>Rachel had other ideas. Using her arms for leverage, she pulled up enough to sling her legs around his waist. The brush of her satin-soft pussy against his abdomen caused him to stumble. He aimed for the wall to the right of the hallway entrance, one hand reaching out to cushion her back from the impact.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she breathed in his ear. \u201cYou make me so hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel.\u201d He pressed his temple to hers and closed his eyes, fighting for control. His chest was heaving with gasping breaths, keeping him ever aware of her breasts flattened against him.</p><p>Her fingers pushed into his hair, tugging forcefully until his head lifted. She crushed her soft mouth against his, holding him at the angle she wanted. When his lips parted for a sharp inhalation, she took advantage. Her tongue darted inside, licking and stroking in a hot wet kiss.</p><p>Jack groaned, abandoning hope of reining himself in. She was going at him full throttle, her thighs flexing around his hips, her torso undulating against him. If he hadn\u2019t wanted her so badly, it would have been molestation. Or a mauling. As it was, he was so damn turned on by her enthusiasm he was about to come in his pants. After what she\u2019d been through in her youth, the fact that she trusted him enough to be so open and aggressive roused every possessive and protective instinct he had. As much as he\u2019d loved her before, it was nothing compared to what he felt for her now.</p><p>He tore his mouth away. \u201cRachel . . . sweetheart . . . slow down. Let me get a grip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoooo,\u201d she moaned, pressing kisses along his whisker-rough jaw until she reached his ear. \u201cHurry up. If you don\u2019t get inside me soon, I\u2019m going to self-combust, I swear. Or go off without you. This caveman thing is sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>He would have laughed if he hadn\u2019t felt like he was drowning. She had no idea what she was asking for, but she was about to get it.</p><p>RACHEL sank her teeth into Jack\u2019s earlobe and tugged on his hair. The dark, exotic scent of his heated skin made her feel wild and uninhibited. And the edge to his voice, the strain evident in his tone and the tension in his body, incited her into pushing him as far as he would go.</p><p>As far as she would go, and beyond . . .</p><p>She was acutely aware of the nearby open sliding glass door and the proximity of the public beach beyond it. Distantly, she heard voices and music. If the lights had been on in the house, she and Jack would have been on full display. As it was, they were shrouded in darkness while the outside was bathed in the faint light of the rising moon. Still, the risk of discovery was thrilling.</p><p>Jack steadied their entwined bodies with one knee against the wall. His hand stroked down her back to her buttocks, where he squeezed the firm swell of one cheek, kneading it, making her really damn glad she\u2019d done all those lunges and squats in preparation for this night. She\u2019d trained like she was preparing for a marathon, expecting a night in Jack\u2019s bed would be equally strenuous.</p><p>God, she couldn\u2019t wait, and she felt conflicted about that. It had been twelve years since any other man but Steve had made love to her, and Jack was so very different. There was nothing comfortable or familiar about his touch, yet it was just what she needed. Just want she wanted. His hands felt as if they should be on her, touching her. Not because he was so confident about it, but because it just felt right.</p><p>When his hand slid lower, she froze, every muscle tensing in anticipation of his touch going just where she ached for it. Everything was happening so fast, yet not fast enough.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he soothed, nuzzling beneath her ear with his lips. Spreading his fingers, he reached between her parted legs from behind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rachel sensed the change in him. It felt like the calm before a storm, when the temperature increased, the wind stilled, and the air became heavy with expectation. She shivered, so damn worked up she felt as if the slightest touch could set her off. Her skin felt too tight and hot. Her chest too constricted.</p><p>Leaning his head back, he looked at her with heavy-lidded eyes. Watching her, as two fingers slipped inside her.</p><p>The sound that escaped her was thready with need. Her pussy rippled with greed, sucking at the two thick male fingers sliding in her to the knuckles. The tension bled away, her muscles slackening as pleasure coursed through her veins.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tight.\u201d His voice was rough as sandpaper. His fingers withdrew to the tips, then thrust deep. Her quivering thighs lost their grip on his hips.</p><p>Jack pulled free of her clinging pussy and cupped the backs of her legs, bending down to help her feet touch the floor. She fell back against the wall with her eyes closed, her palms pressed flat against the wainscoting, her breathing quick and shallow.</p><p>He caught her face in his hands and kissed her, his mouth slanting across hers with a ferocity he hadn\u2019t displayed earlier. Whatever resistance he\u2019d felt before was gone, replaced by a sharply focused determination that made her heart race.</p><p>She\u2019d had it so wrong. There was no way she could have prepared for this. As his mouth moved along her cheek to her throat, suckling and nibbling the tender skin, she felt herself unraveling. All the stability and structure she\u2019d forged for herself melted away beneath the scorching heat of Jack\u2019s single-minded desire. There was no hesitation in his approach, no tentativeness in his touch, no caution in the command he exerted on her body.</p><p>His hands moved from her jaw to her shoulders, then down her arms. As the liquid heat of his mouth surrounded a tightly puckered nipple, he gripped her rib cage in his hands and pulled her to him, arching her backward so that her breasts thrust toward him like a gift.</p> <p>Her eyes flew open, focusing on the shadowed ceiling above her. The feel of Jack\u2019s tongue fluttering over her nipple was so exquisite, she thought she might orgasm. Her stomach quivered and her hips writhed. Her clit pulsed with need.</p><p>\u201cSuck me,\u201d she begged, needing a quick release to take the biting edge off her lust.</p><p>He did as she asked but not in the way she needed. Not fast and not gentle. Every slow, hard suck radiated downward, intensifying the hunger gripping her in an iron fist. The hot tugging at her breast was echoed in her womb, with sharp rhythmic contractions spurring her need to climax and driving her insane.</p><p>\u201cFaster.\u201d</p><p>His mouth moved across to the neglected nipple, his teeth scraping over the hardened crest, pausing at the tip to flicker his tongue across it.</p><p>\u201cJack. Please.\u201d Her head fell to the side, her flushed cheek pressing against the cool drywall. \u201cMore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSoft and sweet. Too sweet to rush tasting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re smaller than you like,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>His next suck was so strong it brought pleasure bordering on pain. She whimpered and dug her short fingernails into her palms. He drew hard on her again, then soothed the throbbing point with soft licks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re what I like.\u201d His hands moved in counterpoint to the recent fierceness of his mouth, his thumbs stroking tenderly across the crease beneath each breast, gentling her. Two sides of the same man\u2014one careful and reverent, the other rough and wild. \u201cEvery inch of you.\u201d</p><p>Urging her back against the wall, his hands slid down past her waist to her hips, his knees bending as he moved lower. He kissed the moist spot between her breasts. \u201cThis inch.\u201d</p><p>His tongue followed his downward path, licking along the center of her stomach to dip his tongue in her navel. \u201cAnd this one.\u201d</p><p>When he gripped her buttocks in each hand and pulled her hips forward, electricity raced across her skin. He nuzzled against her bare mound. \u201cDefinitely this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d survive it if he put his mouth on her. She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d survive if he didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cHold yourself open for me,\u201d he ordered, his voice husky. \u201cLet me see you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze locked with his. Although he spoke with command, there was a softness to the way he looked at her that prevented shyness or second guessing. Inhaling deeply, she reached down and exposed her pussy . . . and so much more of herself than he could possibly know.</p><p>five</p><p>\u201cVery pretty.\u201d</p><p>The admiration in Jack\u2019s voice flowed through Rachel in a warm rush of pleasure. He blew a gentle stream of air over her and she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cAnd so sensitive,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYour clit is peeping out at me, greedy thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTease,\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cTeases don\u2019t deliver.\u201d Licking his lips, he leaned in. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you come so hard the neighbors will hear you.\u201d</p><p>He paused for an endless second, making her wait. When she was about to scream, he stroked the flat of his tongue across her. Biting back a cry, Rachel fought to remain standing. Her hands shook as she kept herself spread for him, her knees threatening to buckle.</p><p>\u201cYou better hold on to me,\u201d he warned darkly, then he dove full force for the aching flesh between her thighs.</p><p>Wielding the point of his tongue like a lash, Jack caught the tip of her distended clitoris and fluttered over it with lightning quickness. She climaxed with a low moan, the orgasm tearing through her senses with a force she never knew she could withstand. Her body was wracked by violent shudders, her toes curling painfully into the hardwood floor.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t let up. His grip on her ass tightened and he tongued her like a man possessed, his hungry growls throwing her headlong into a second climax directly on the heels of the first. Incited by his wildness, she caught his head by the sweat-dampened roots of his hair and rode his working mouth. She took what she needed, grinding against his wickedly skilled tongue. Shameless in her pleasure, she didn\u2019t care who heard or saw her. The only thing that mattered was Jack and what he was doing to her.</p><p>When the rush ebbed, it took all of her energy with it. She sagged into the wall, gasping for air and trembling.</p><p>Jack stood and lifted her over his shoulder, then turned back toward the couch. When she regained the ability to speak, she was going to tell him again how hot his caveman tendencies were to her. Or maybe she\u2019d just show him . . .</p><p>He sat her down on the armrest of the couch and stepped between her knees. With a hand behind her head, he urged her backward, balancing her so that her torso hung suspended over the cushions.</p><p>With no leverage whatsoever, Rachel could only accept what he gave her\u2014the teasing glide of his tongue along the seam of her lips . . . the nip of his teeth at her jaw . . . the questing of his fingers as they parted her again and pushed through oversensitive tissues . . .</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d Rachel caught him by the belt loops, arching helplessly into his grip.</p><p>His fingers curved upward inside her, stroking, searching. She writhed, her abdominal muscles so tense they cramped. The anticipation was a torment all its own, as was the illicitness of their location. The couch was set in front of the sliding glass doors to take advantage of the ocean view. The slanting moonlight ended at the base of the sofa, only an inch or two away from the shadows where Jack fucked his fingers into her.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d His mouth curved wickedly as he tapped against her G-spot. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens first: I make you come, or you get into my pants.\u201d</p><p>Rachel really wanted to win. She wanted to see what he looked like, what he felt like. But she was a mess. Emotionally. Physically. And he had a head start. As she fumbled to rip open his button fly, he pressed and rubbed with his roughened fingertips. Fingertips that were strong enough to hold his entire body weight while rock climbing, yet were achingly gentle with her.</p><p>She\u2019d barely freed his cock from the restrictive denim when the orgasm hit her. Moaning, she instinctively tried to pull away from the overload of sensation, but he held her immobile and made her take it. He leaned over her as she quaked, pressing his lips to her ear and crooning words she could barely hear over the rushing of blood in her ears. Let go . . . I have you . . . You\u2019re safe with me . . . His hand thrust and twisted between her legs, the relentlessness so at odds with the gentle tone of his voice. It felt so much like a feral sort of claiming, a branding, a demand that she surrender to him completely.</p><p>That man will never accept anything less than one hundred percent of a woman\u2019s soul, her much wiser mother-in-law once said. Rachel used to wonder what kind of woman would be strong enough to share so much of herself. Now, she knew. She went slack in his arms, embracing her newfound fortitude and turning herself over to the passionate side of Jack she\u2019d fantasized about.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d he murmured, the one word filled with an aching tenderness. His fingers left her.</p><p>She exhaled audibly. \u201cI want to feel you. Inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any condoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I got back on the pill two months ago, the day after you made plans to come out here.\u201d</p><p>His breath hissed out between his teeth.</p><p>Rachel cupped his cheek. \u201cYou never stood a chance.\u201d</p><p>The kiss he gave her was fierce and passionate, relaying so much more than lust and desire. She clung to him, soaking up the flood of emotion from a man known for his reserve and austerity. This was why she could blossom for him, why she felt fearless and audacious. They were so much alike in that way, their still waters running deeper than most.</p><p>Jack broke the kiss, breathing heavily. He moved her with unsteady hands, turning her so she draped bonelessly over the couch arm, her back to his front.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt more emotionally raw or physically vulnerable. When she heard the rustle of his jeans, her hands fisted beside her head. She stared sightlessly out the open patio door, feeling the cool evening air flowing over her damp skin. There was no longer any tension in her, no resistance, no aggression. When Jack cupped her inner thigh, she widened the spread of her legs of her own volition, needing a deeper physical connection to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand stroked down her spine, then up again. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Rachel gave a jerky nod.</p><p>He brushed her sweat-soaked bangs away from her forehead and pressed a kiss to her shoulder blade. \u201cCan you take more?\u201d</p> <p>She reached behind her to cup the back of his thigh. Feeling the bunching of his jeans, she realized he\u2019d only bothered to push them down just enough to gain the access he needed. The image of how they must look\u2014she, drowsy and naked; he, tautly focused and partially dressed\u2014sparked a renewed flare of desire. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jack straightened and a heartbeat later she felt the broad, plush head of his cock tuck into the clenching opening of her pussy. He was so hot and hard as steel. The feel of him made her bite her lip while the first slow push had her clawing at the white slipcover.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d He restrained her hips with a firm yet gentle grip. \u201cJust relax. You\u2019re nice and soft now. Let it happen.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t know what he was asking of her. As the wide crown breached the tautly stretched entrance to her body, the intense feeling of possession was overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cOh God . . .\u201d she breathed, every nerve ending electrified by the leisurely thrusts with which he worked his cock into her.</p> <p>If she hadn\u2019t been so languid, Rachel doubted she could have taken him. As it was, the stretching was so acute she swore she could feel every ridge and vein, every beat of his racing pulse. It was like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced. She was grateful to be facing away from him, needing to shield the raw emotion she knew must be visible on her face. She couldn\u2019t scare him away now. Not after this.</p><p>Bending his knees, Jack pushed the final few inches inside her. She buried her face in the sofa cushion to muffle her plaintive moan. He was so thick and hard. Every shuddering breath she took made her feel how deep he was.</p><p>She felt his tongue slide upward along her back, then a sharp possessive bite at her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d he whispered, reaching beneath her to cup her breasts in his large hands. Clutching her to his heaving chest, he began to move. Withdrawing partway, then gliding home. Being far too careful, as if she was breakable. Although she felt as if she might shatter, she didn\u2019t want his restraint. Not when she\u2019d started falling apart the moment he\u2019d touched her.</p><p>She threw her hips back at him. \u201cFuck me. Don\u2019t play with me!\u201d</p><p>Jack stilled, which allowed her to feel the fine tremors in his hands and thighs. As deliberate as he seemed, his body betrayed him\u2014he was leashed, but only barely.</p> <p>As much as she was able, she tightened her inner muscles around the rigid cock throbbing within her.</p><p>He cursed and gripped her tighter. \u201cRachel . . . damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Hunching over her, he pulled his hips back, then slammed deep. The weight of his heavy sack smacked against her clit, sending fire racing along her skin in a prickling wave.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d He flexed inside her, teasing nerve endings she hadn\u2019t known she possessed. \u201cHow hard do you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was fucking her before she finished. His hips thrusting and churning, shafting her tender pussy with hard, heavy drives.</p><p>She climaxed with his arms wrapped around her, holding her as she sobbed with the pleasure. He groaned as she rippled around him, joining her, jerking violently with every hot thick spurt. His cheek pressed tightly to her temple and the scent of his skin surrounded her, filling her mind along with her name.</p> <p>As he emptied himself inside her, it was her name he repeated in a jagged litany, spoken in a serrated voice that pushed her over the razor\u2019s edge of infatuation into something far more dangerous.</p><p>Somehow, she\u2019d managed to get under his skin. She intended to stay there.</p><p>six</p><p>Jack tucked one arm behind his head and watched as the ceiling lightened incrementally with the rise of the sun. Rachel lay sleeping on the bed beside him, the white cotton sheet tangled around her torso. Her lips were slightly parted, as if in expectation of a kiss, and he fought the urge to wake her and have her again.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t certain what time she needed to get up to prepare for Riley\u2019s party, but it was barely six, so he figured she could sleep for at least another couple hours yet. She needed it. There were dark shadows beneath her eyes. Her breasts were reddened by the scratch of his whiskers. When she\u2019d been curled on her side, he saw the faint indentation of his teeth in her shoulder.</p><p>Damn it. She was too tender and soft for him to lose control with her\u2014both emotionally and physically. Jack scrubbed a hand over his face. And he\u2019d made a gross tactical miscalculation. In the light of day, he was no longer willing to be a one-night stand.</p><p>She\u2019d been planning on going to bed with him for months . . .</p><p>Fuckin\u2019 A. Just thinking about it tore him up.</p><p>Yes, Rachel deserved better than him, but he could make some adjustments and sacrifices, he could learn what she needed and give his best shot at delivering. He could show her that he could make love to her slowly, sweetly. Take his time. Let her set the pace. He had no option other than to try; he couldn\u2019t pretend last night never happened. Maybe she\u2019d come into it because of Steve, but he could give her a reason to stick with it.</p><p>Too wired to sleep, Jack slipped carefully from the bed and dressed for a run. He hit the beach and tried to clear his head.</p><p>He\u2019d never been good with words.</p><p>Now he needed to find the right ones to change the rest of his life.</p><p>RACHEL woke to the sound of the shower running. She smelled coffee and smiled, relishing the intimacy of sharing her morning with another adult. Rolling to her side, she searched for a clock and found one on the nightstand on Jack\u2019s side of the bed. It was turned away from her, so she crawled over and moved it. Seven forty-five.</p><p>Beside the clock was Jack\u2019s badge and billfold. She stared at the silver star, feeling a rush of pride and respect. He was a Shadow Stalker, a member of the U.S. Marshals Service\u2019s elite Special Operations Group. He\u2019d explained the nickname to her once\u2014the Shadow Stalkers unit hunted dangerous fugitives, or \u201cshadows,\u201d and waited in the shadows of federal courthouses during high-profile cases. His job suited him so well that she couldn\u2019t imagine him doing anything else. She certainly would never ask him to give it up, even though the thought of losing him terrified her.</p><p>Reaching for the badge, she accidentally knocked the wallet to the floor. It landed on its back and flopped open. Her smiling face stared up at her.</p><p>She got out of bed. Bending down, she picked the billfold up. It felt wrong to pry, but she couldn\u2019t resist. Whose image did he carry with him? Who were the important people in his life?</p><p>Rachel turned each plastic photo protector slowly, touched to see pictures of Steve and Riley along with ones of her. But when she reached the end and found only one photo that wasn\u2019t of her family\u2014one with several guys in bulletproof vests and sunglasses\u2014she frowned. There were no pictures of parents or siblings, or nieces and nephews. No photos of himself with anyone.</p><p>Her heart broke a little. \u201cJack,\u201d she whispered, wondering if he felt as alone as he suddenly seemed to her.</p><p>She\u2019d known that Jack grew up in foster care, but she\u2019d assumed he formed some lasting connections with someone. Anyone. Was it possible he hadn\u2019t?</p><p>If she and Riley were all he had, no wonder he was wary and reluctant. It certainly wasn\u2019t from lack of desire.</p><p>Standing, she walked to the master bathroom. She gave a cursory knock, then cracked the door open. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>His voice was warm and purring. The shower was enclosed with frosted glass, affording her just enough of a glimpse of his perfect body to light her up. She could get used to this.</p><p>\u201cCoffee\u2019s brewed,\u201d he said. \u201cI picked up some of that sugar-free hazelnut creamer you like.\u201d</p><p>Sweatpants and a sweat-stained T-shirt lay piled on the floor. She couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d exercised after their exertions the night before. She felt like an underachiever. She also felt loved and cared for.</p><p>Jack paid attention to her and the things she liked in ways she hadn\u2019t fully appreciated until Steve was gone. The flowers he sent weekly were either calla lilies, stargazer lilies, or tulips\u2014her favorites. How did he know that? Perhaps Steve mentioned it. But her favorite Luzianne chicory coffee, which had to be ordered? Or her favorite hand cream, Japanese Cherry Blossom Shea Cashmere, the smell of which was usually hidden by her perfume? Even Steve, the one person who\u2019d known her better than anyone, couldn\u2019t remember that.</p><p>Maybe Jack\u2019s attention to detail was just part of who he was and the job he did. After all, the U.S. Marshals Service was responsible for the Witness Security Program. Maybe the little things he remembered about her were things he\u2019d pick up on anyone, part of the process of wiping a person\u2019s identity and erasing identifying habits. But maybe something more personal was involved. She hoped so, because she\u2019d started falling in love with him over those gifts and how they made her feel. After years of having everything she loved denigrated and belittled by her aunt until she didn\u2019t enjoy anything at all, Jack had taught her to celebrate the things that made her happy.</p><p>Smiling at the thought, she bent down and picked up after him, grabbing his clothes and taking them out to the hamper in the bedroom. It wasn\u2019t a task she was particularly fond of usually, but she was beginning to think Jack could use a little looking after. Besides, he\u2019d made the coffee. She was willing to trade quite a bit for the pleasure of waking up to freshly brewed coffee.</p><p>\u201cWould you totally gross out,\u201d she asked, returning to the bathroom, \u201cif I use your toothbrush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>Rachel was rinsing her mouth out when Jack turned off the water in the shower. Straightening, she turned and faced him, determined to catch the view. The door slid open. A dripping wet and gorgeously naked Jack appeared, and she gave an appreciative whistle. He was perfectly sculpted from head to toe. And the package in the middle, impressive even while semi-erect, made her hot and needy. She could seriously get used to this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth twitched with suppressed amusement as he reached for the towel hanging on the wall. He\u2019d shaved and looked less rogue warrior and more GQ cover model. She loved both looks on him.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She stepped closer, licking her lower lip.</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes filled with a heat that made her flush. His arm dropped back to his side. \u201cI\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p> <p>JACK held his position despite the seemingly endless insurgence.</p><p>As if Rachel sensed his wariness, she\u2019d brought him a beer earlier, hiding it from the multitude of underage eyes with an insulated bottle cozy. He didn\u2019t touch it, knowing from experience that it was best to stay razor sharp when surrounded by unknowns.</p><p>From the safety of the grill, he eyed the dozen or so eight-year-olds running around the patio of Rachel\u2019s small two-story condominium. It was a madhouse, but he didn\u2019t feel as out of place as he\u2019d expected he would. That was certainly because of Rachel, who smiled at him often and made a point of including him.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and smiled down at Riley, who looked so much like his dad. Riley had the same smiling sloe eyes and cheerful grin, the same quick laugh and desire to help others. \u201cHey, sport. Having fun?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTotally. I have a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Aunt Stella says you like my mom.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the picnic table, where most of the Tse family was gathered. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike her like a girlfriend. You know, kissing and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jack focused on the burgers and hot dogs grilling in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cShe says guys only pay attention to what kind of coffee creamer a girl likes when she\u2019s his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Not knowing how to reply, Jack just nodded slowly and shot another glance at Rachel. She was talking about him to the Tses. He hoped that was working in his favor.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d Riley pressed. \u201cIs my mom your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d Jack blew out his breath. \u201cHow would you feel about that? Is that bugging you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Will you be coming around more? I think you should come around more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be working on that. I\u2019d like to spend more time with you. There are some things your dad and I used to do together\u2014fishing, golfing, taking some Sea-Doos out to Havasu . . . I think you\u2019ll enjoy those same things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSea-Doos?\u201d Riley\u2019s dark eyes lit up. \u201cReally? That would be so cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to make plans, then.\u201d</p> <p>Riley ran off, shouting at his friends, but skid to a halt a few feet away and came back. \u201cWatch out for Aunt Stella,\u201d he said in a stage whisper. \u201cShe says if mom doesn\u2019t snatch you up, she will. She\u2019s cool, but . . . well . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Jack somehow managed to keep his face impassive. \u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d</p><p>Watching his godson run off, Jack rocked back on his heels and felt hopeful. If the Tses were endorsing him, he had a chance in hell. He\u2019d take it.</p><p>His cell phone rang and his light mood sank like a stone. Pulling it out of his pocket, he answered, \u201cKilligrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack.\u201d Gary Lancet\u2019s grim voice was like a cold shower. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt you on leave, but I figured you\u2019d kick my ass if you found out after you got back.\u201d</p><p>Jack set down the tongs he\u2019d been using to turn the hot dogs. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of Terry\u2019s old collars went to his house. Fucked the place up and killed his dog. Callie\u2019s a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Are she and the kids okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re shaken up but fine. It\u2019s a miracle they weren\u2019t home at the time. Her damn radiator hose took a shit on the way back from picking them up from school. Otherwise . . . Well, it could have been a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>Looking at Rachel and the festive scene around him, Jack finally felt the sensation of being the odd man out. He should have felt it earlier. His life, such as it was, didn\u2019t fit here. He\u2019d forgotten that for a while. The grisly reminder was a timely one. He hadn\u2019t yet laid his heart on the line; retracting it would have been a lot harder than just bailing early. \u201cAm I needed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got it covered. I just knew you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Tell Terry to call me if he needs anything. I still have some things to wrap up here, but nothing that can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you posted.\u201d</p><p>Jack hung up and stared at the phone for a long minute. Just imagining what Terry must be going through made his gut knot. Thinking about a close call like that happening to Rachel and Riley about doubled him over. Sweat beaded his forehead despite the coolness of the northern California weather. He rubbed at the tightness in the center of his chest. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s voice came from behind him. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>He turned, grateful for the sunglasses shielding his eyes. \u201cSomething\u2019s gone down back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She bit her lower lip. \u201cDo you have to go?\u201d</p><p>Facing her disappointment only strengthened his resolve to stop being selfish. He had to think of her first. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cI\u2019d understand if you had to go. Riley would, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to understand.\u201d</p><p>One of her brows arched. \u201cReally? Says who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not do this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, then. Right after this is over.\u201d</p><p>It was already over. Not that it ever really had a chance to begin.</p><p>RACHEL picked up the last bit of torn wrapping paper that had blown beneath the patio table and straightened. Her house was almost back to normal . . . except for the brooding deputy attacking her gas grill with a steel brush.</p><p>Jack had grown strangely quiet since taking that phone call a couple hours before. He managed smiles for Riley, who\u2019d loved every one of the too-many gifts Jack had given him. Gifts that were craft sets or science projects or models. Things that were taught or built. Rachel took note of the fact that a man who worked with death and destruction was fostering a love of discovery and creation in her son. But Jack was unable to muster even a ghost of a smile for her. Instead, when their gazes met, he looked . . . ravaged.</p><p>She shoved the trash in the garbage bag beside her and yanked on the handles to seal it. Then she approached Jack, coming up behind him and wrapping her arms around his lean waist. Even though he\u2019d seen her coming, he tensed when her arms encircled him. She was grateful her mother-in-law and Stella had taken Riley to Target to spend his gift cards. It gave her the chance to get things straightened out with Jack.</p><p>She slid her hands beneath the hem of his shirt and caressed his washboard abs. \u201cStella tells me I need to keep you around and exploit your mad grilling skills.\u201d</p><p>He set one hand over hers, stilling her movements. \u201cFlipping burgers isn\u2019t enough to fix my faults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you have faults? What a relief! I was beginning to think you were perfect.\u201d</p><p>Jack set the brush down and turned carefully to face her. \u201cRachel.\u201d</p><p>She pushed up his sunglasses to reveal his eyes. They were completely shuttered. \u201cWhat was the phone call about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you should have to worry over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. Whatever was said to you has you pulling back. Since I\u2019m the one you\u2019re pulling back from, I deserve to know why.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling harshly, he pulled off his sunglasses and hung them from the collar of his T-shirt. \u201cOne of the guys on the team had a scare today.\u201d</p><p>Rachel listened to his voice as he told her what happened. It was tight and clipped, his jaw taut. Someone he cared about\u2014one of the very few\u2014was hurting now and that was hurting Jack.</p><p>\u201cYou know you can talk to me about anything, right?\u201d Her fingers stroked soothingly across his nape. \u201cThe good, the bad, and the ugly. It helps to get it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you involved in stuff like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need this crap in your life,\u201d he said harshly. \u201cRiley doesn\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need you,\u201d she retorted, \u201cand you and the job are a package deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me.\u201d His dark gaze was stormy. \u201cI\u2019ll always be here for you, just as I\u2019ve always been. We just need to keep things simple.\u201d</p><p>That was ridiculous. What they had was totally complicated. He was complicated, and he was used to keeping his circle of friends small and tight. Letting her in probably scared the shit out of him on a level he didn\u2019t even recognize. Because then he could lose her, one way or the other.</p><p>He was going to figure out, real quick, that she had absolutely no intention of getting lost.</p><p>seven</p><p>\u201cSimple, huh?\u201d Rachel backed away from him and headed into the house. She needed a beer. Maybe two. \u201cAs simple as living in the same town?\u201d</p><p>Jack followed her. \u201cAs simple as keeping things the way they have been until last night.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if he heard how gruff he sounded, how defensive.</p><p>Reaching the fridge, she pulled out two beers and set one down in front of him. They faced each other across her kitchen counter with equally wary and examining glances.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to make that decision by yourself, Jack.\u201d She twisted off the top of her beer and took a swig.</p><p>His gaze narrowed. He had his game face on, dangerous and inscrutable. \u201cI\u2019ll make the decision if it keeps you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the person you\u2019re trying to save is yourself.\u201d She pointed at him with the neck of her bottle. \u201cI scare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking of something happening to you scares me.\u201d He opened his beer and drank, watching her as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cSo, you ride off into the sunset, and I\u2019m here safe and sound . . . until I get carjacked at the gas station. Or robbed at the store.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot the same thing,\u201d he argued. \u201cThe level of inherent risk with me is much higher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be more worried about you not coming home than the reverse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m getting into when I go to work. You didn\u2019t sign up for this.\u201d Jack ran his hand through his hair. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is bring more traumas to your life. You and Riley need someone who comes home every day. Someone who leaves their work at the office. Someone\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike Steve?\u201d she interjected. \u201cA guy who never had a moving violation in his life. No speeding tickets. A guy who never drove without his seat belt on. Who would have thought he\u2019d die in a car wreck? No one. Terrible things happen to unsuspecting people every day. It\u2019s part of living, Jack. There\u2019s no way to go through life risk-free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bringing the shit from my job to your doorstep. Period.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s foot tapped on the tile floor. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t know what I was taking on when I seduced you? I\u2019m a grown woman with a child who depends on me. I don\u2019t jump without looking. You seem to be forgetting how well and how long I\u2019ve known you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve didn\u2019t know the gritty details of what I do. If he had, he never would have wanted you anywhere near me on a permanent basis.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved to the photo of Steve and Jack on the mantel in the next room. She could barely make out the details from where she stood, but the image was indelibly etched on her mind; she could see it with her eyes closed. Both men were dark-haired and brown-eyed. Both were tall and fit. But that was where the similarities ended. Steve\u2019s handsome Asian features reflected his fun and easy charm, while Jack\u2019s gaze was shadowed and his smile guarded. Steve had been content with the simple things in life\u2014like her. Extroverted and spontaneous, he was known and liked by damn near everyone; Jack was hard to know and harder to understand.</p> <p>Yet she loved them both madly.</p><p>Rachel looked at him. \u201cYou were the brother Steve never had. He trusted you with his life. But I don\u2019t make my decisions based on conjecture about what my deceased husband would think of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d he challenged softly, his eyes so dark they looked black. \u201cTell me Steve isn\u2019t the reason you came over last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve isn\u2019t the reason I came over last night.\u201d She lifted her chin. \u201cI loved my husband. I couldn\u2019t have loved him more. He was everything to me and if he were alive right now, what happened last night would never have happened. But he died, and I came to terms with that. I changed. My needs and wants changed. And now, when I look at you, I don\u2019t think about him. I don\u2019t think about you in relation to him. Half the time, I don\u2019t think at all, because I\u2019m too busy appreciating the view. If you gave me some kind of best friend pity fuck last night, that\u2019s on you. Don\u2019t try and say that\u2019s where I was coming from.\u201d</p><p>Jack was oddly still . . . except for the rapid tempo of his breathing and the fevered brightness of his eyes, both of which betrayed far more volatile emotions.</p><p>Rachel frowned, catching on to the fact that she was missing something. She didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d made love to her for any other reason than that he\u2019d wanted to, but she was beginning to think he hadn\u2019t attributed the same motivation to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s going through your head?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I was wrong.\u201d He looked down at his bottle, which he twisted and turned atop the counter. There was a softness to his features that tightened her chest.</p><p>\u201cMost especially in thinking you could put on the breaks and slide into reverse.\u201d She bent down and leaned to the side, catching his lowered gaze. \u201cThere\u2019s only forward, Jack. I stopped looking back a while ago.\u201d</p><p>JACK stared at the vibrant woman looking at him in a way he\u2019d never allowed himself to even dream about and knew he was done. He was never going to be able to say no to her. Not now. Not in the future. He wanted to give her everything, make her happy, keep her safe.</p><p>As if she knew what he was thinking, she said, \u201cThe safest place I can be is right next to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when I\u2019m the reason you\u2019re endangered to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you spend some of your off-duty days teaching me how to shoot a gun until I\u2019m dangerous. You help me pick out an outrageously expensive and comprehensive alarm system for the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. For now.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnd you wear a bulletproof vest all the time. No crazy heroics.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept when I want you naked.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. \u201cI was hoping that would be all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter last night, that is all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be wearing body armor only rarely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want me to kick your ass and deny you sexual favors, try it.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted his beer to his mouth to hide a smile. It was inappropriate considering the seriousness of the discussion, but Rachel always had that effect on him. She made him happy in spite of himself.</p><p>\u201cYou can talk to me about anything, Jack,\u201d she said softly, all levity gone. \u201cYou can ask me anything, and I\u2019ll try to come through for you. But you can\u2019t tell me to let you walk away. I can\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed and looked around the condo she\u2019d bought after Steve died. It was the perfect size for her and Riley. The kitchen boasted new stainless-steel appliances and was big in relation to the overall square footage, which suited someone who baked for a living. The window over the sink had curtains with cupcakes on them\u2014a housewarming gift from Steve\u2019s mom.</p><p>\u201cYou have a good life here,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got family nearby and a new business. Riley has his friends and classmates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have it good.\u201d She set her elbow on the counter, then her chin in her hand. \u201cYou do realize, don\u2019t you, that I never could have done what I did last night with any other man? I can\u2019t even imagine throwing myself at anyone else. Even with Steve, I waited for him to make the first moves. I was always afraid I\u2019d stir up more than I could handle.\u201d</p><p>Jack forced himself to breath deep and easy, trying to slow the rapid beating of his heart. \u201cI was rough with you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re in love. And I loved every moment with you. I wouldn\u2019t change one thing that happened last night. I told myself I was strong enough to take you on, and now I know I can.\u201d She smiled gently. \u201cThat\u2019s not a surprise is it? That you\u2019re in love with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I knew.\u201d He watched as something hot and tender swept over her face. \u201cI also know loving someone means wanting what\u2019s best for them. I\u2019m not good for you.\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand when she opened her mouth to speak. \u201cHear me out. Any minute now, my phone could ring and I will have to go. Christmas, your birthday . . . I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be here. Once I leave, I won\u2019t always know when I\u2019ll be back. One of these days, you\u2019re gonna wake up and realize you want someone around full-time.\u201d</p><p>Rachel straightened. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting by on my own with Riley for two years. I don\u2019t need a man around just because. I don\u2019t have any problem going to bed alone. What I want is you. Not some interchangeable guy; not someone like Steve. Look at it this way: I already have the cake. You\u2019re the icing on top, with sprinkles, candied fruit, and chocolate drizzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m just as bad for your health,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI want you going straight to my hips. I want the sugar rush and the toe-curling deliciousness. I\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips and his dick went hard, remembering what that mouth had done to him when he\u2019d stepped out of the shower that morning.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Jack laid it out there. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to risk losing you and Riley completely. I can live with what we\u2019ve got now, but nothing at all . . . I don\u2019t think I\u2019d survive it.\u201d</p><p>Rachel rounded the counter. \u201cI\u2019m deliberately keeping this light, because I don\u2019t want to scare you off. I\u2019m saving the heavy stuff for later, when you can\u2019t run. I was thinking you should be handcuffed to the bed before I tell you that you\u2019re stuck with me for the rest of your life and I\u2019m the last woman you\u2019re ever going to bed with.\u201d</p><p>She walked right into him, hugging him tight. He had to restrain himself from squeezing her too hard. God, he was crazy for even thinking this could work.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d she went on, \u201cwe\u2019ll start with a race to see who can acquire the most frequent-flier miles by the end of the year, and work from there. Week by week, you\u2019ll learn that not being able to live without me means living with me. Eventually, you\u2019ll get used to not being alone and we\u2019ll both become familiar with this new take-no-prisoners version of myself that you inspire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making this sound easy,\u201d he murmured with his lips to the crown of her head, \u201cbut it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back to look up at him. \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to have to work on it and make some sacrifices and take risks. What I\u2019m saying is it\u2019ll be worth it. The difficult part\u2019s already over\u2014we both fell hard. It\u2019s onward and upward from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake no prisoners.\u201d He shook his head and a small laugh escaped him. God, he was scared shitless. He didn\u2019t know how to bring something precious and fragile into his life.</p><p>\u201cExcept for you.\u201d Her hands slid up his back. Her lips whispered across his jaw.</p><p>Jack lifted her feet from the floor. \u201cI want to be good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been. You are. You will be.\u201d Her teeth scraped lightly over his earlobe, sending a surge of heat and longing through him. \u201cI\u2019m going to show you all the ways I\u2019ve grown stronger because of you. Because of things you\u2019ve done for me and said to me. Because of how you look at me. For a long time, I didn\u2019t understand why you look at me the way you do, but I knew you saw something in me I wasn\u2019t seeing. I can\u2019t tell you how many times thoughts of you motivated me when I wasn\u2019t sure I could get something done.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>He kissed the top of her shoulder, which was bared by the asymmetrical shirt she wore. \u201cYou can do anything you set your mind to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m setting my mind to returning the favor. Together, we can overcome anything\u2014our pasts, your job, a long-distance relationship.
