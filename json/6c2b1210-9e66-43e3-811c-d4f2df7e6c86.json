It made the frigid hangar marginally bearable. She hunched deeper into her coat and peered through the dim light. Raphael was down near the nose of the aircraft, deep in conversation with Juro. She could only make them out because of the multicolored glow of the jet\u2019s cockpit coming through the windshield. Raphael looked up briefly, and his eyes flashed silver. Her heart twisted at the sight. He was so gorgeous. It still took her breath away sometimes.</p><p>\u201cHe worries about you.\u201d</p> <p>Cyn controlled an involuntary jerk of surprise at the sound of Duncan\u2019s voice over her left shoulder. \u201cDuh,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes in his direction.</p><p>Duncan laughed as she turned towards him. \u201cI will miss you, Cyn, you and Raphael more than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all happening so fast,\u201d she complained softly.</p><p>Duncan leaned forward. \u201cNot really. We\u2019ve planned this for some time, but it\u2019s been only days that we knew the time was right. And you haven\u2019t been yourself lately\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You thought I\u2019d have a relapse or something if you told me? It\u2019s my body that was injured, Duncan, not my mind. I\u2019m not that fragile.\u201d</p> <p>He was silent for a long time, standing perfectly still, the way he did sometimes, until she could almost forget he was there.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see him, Cynthia,\u201d he said at last. \u201cWhen we thought you would die, you didn\u2019t see what it did to him. You weren\u2019t the only person damaged that night, and you need to take care of him now, because I won\u2019t be here to do so.\u201d</p><p>Cyn grabbed his hand when he would have turned away. \u201cI love him, Duncan. More than anything in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. But you need to care for him as well. I couldn\u2019t leave otherwise.\u201d He tightened his hold on her hand and raised it to his lips, kissing it softly.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d Raphael\u2019s deep voice interrupted, his hand leaving a line of welcome heat as he trailed his fingers down Cyn\u2019s back before resting a hand on her hip.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Duncan responded with a respectful nod.</p> <p>Raphael grinned. \u201cNot for much longer.\u201d</p><p>Duncan lifted one shoulder. \u201cYou may no longer be my lord officially, Sire. But in truth, it will always be so.\u201d</p><p>Cyn stepped back to give the two of them their moment, their voices a bare rumble of sound over the whine of the jet\u2019s engines. It was pathetic the way they stood there pretending to be all manly about their feelings. Far better if they\u2019d just hug, maybe shed a tear or two, and get it over with. But no, that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Raphael shot her a glance over his shoulder, looking as close to desperate as she\u2019d ever seen him. She snickered. Apparently, the hugs and tears were going to be left entirely to her.</p><p>\u201cAll right, my turn,\u201d she said, taking pity at last. She stepped up to Duncan and threw her arms around him in a big, honest-to-goodness hug. No back patting to nullify the emotion of the moment, no quick kiss-kiss sort of fakery. She hugged him long and hard. He hugged her back, too, although she was certain he was being careful of his vampire strength and her still-healing body. But despite all of that, he hugged her, and she felt his head turn away from Raphael, as if to conceal the emotion on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Duncan,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019ll miss you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he murmured at her ear.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll take care of him for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor both of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed then, and she stepped back, slipping her arm around Raphael\u2019s waist while still holding Duncan\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll visit,\u201d she promised. \u201cAnd you can visit us. None of that vampire territorial bullshit, okay?\u201d</p><p>Duncan exchanged a look over her head with Raphael, and Cyn pursed her lips in thought. Those two were up to something. They wouldn\u2019t tell her what it was, of course, but she\u2019d figure it out. She frowned, glancing at the big, industrial clock on the wall of the hangar. Nearly ten p.m. here in California. By the time they got clearance and were off the ground . . .</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you cutting it kind of close?\u201d she asked worriedly. Duncan was taking the smaller of Raphael\u2019s two jets. Small was a relative term when it came to private jets, but she couldn\u2019t remember how fast this particular aircraft could go, assuming she\u2019d ever known. She was pretty sure it couldn\u2019t make D.C. before sunrise, though, and both of the pilots were Vampire, too.</p><p>Duncan squeezed her fingers in reassurance. \u201cWe\u2019ll be stopping in Atlanta tonight, going on to D.C. tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are things Duncan must do immediately upon arriving,\u201d Raphael explained. \u201cHe needs to land in Washington as soon as possible after sunset so he has the entire night to work with.\u201d</p><p>Raphael dropped his arm over Cyn\u2019s shoulder and tightened his hold, effectively pulling her hand away from Duncan. She smiled privately. His move seemed casual enough, but she knew he\u2019d planned it. His vampire possessiveness couldn\u2019t permit even Duncan to hold her hand for long. Which brought her back to her biggest complaint about this whole affair.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t see why he has to go there all alone. Why can\u2019t some of your people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken care of, lubimaya,\u201d Raphael said patiently. \u201cYou must trust us.\u201d</p><p>Cyn tightened her lips against the automatic comeback that came to mind. She did trust them, but it was always possible they hadn\u2019t thought of some detail or other. Sometimes these guys couldn\u2019t see the forest for all those testosterone-laden trees.</p><p>Juro appeared at Raphael\u2019s elbow. \u201cEverything is set, my lord.\u201d He gave Duncan a brief nod. \u201cGood fortune, Duncan,\u201d he said, then walked back to stand near the waiting limo.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Duncan said, straightening into something like attention and bowing slightly from the waist. \u201cIt is has been an honor to serve at your side for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe honor has been mine, Duncan. But Cyn was right. We\u2019ll see you often.\u201d</p><p>Cyn put a gloved hand over her mouth, trying not to cry. Now that the time was here\u2014</p><p>Raphael tugged her back against his chest, wrapping both arms around her. \u201cGo while you can, Duncan. I believe my Cyn feels another hug coming on.\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed and gave her a wink, then spun on one heel and, with vampire speed, disappeared into the Learjet in the blink of an eye. The pilot made a brief appearance in the hatchway as the stairs retracted and the hatch was sealed, and before she knew it, the jet was taxiing out of the hangar and Duncan was gone.</p><p>She turned in Raphael\u2019s arms, burying her face against his neck. \u201cI feel like a mother sending her baby off to college or something,\u201d she muttered, rubbing the tears from her eyes on the soft wool of his coat.</p><p>Raphael chuckled and gave her a tight hug, before leading her over to the limo. Cyn paused long enough to look up at him and say, \u201cDuncan tells me I\u2019m supposed to take care of you now that he\u2019s gone.\u201d As she slid into the cushy interior of the limo, she saw Raphael stiffen in reaction to her comment and grinned in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat was he thinking?\u201d Raphael muttered before he ducked inside and pulled the door closed.</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d she said as he settled her in the curve of his arm.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you did.\u201d</p><p>She huffed a laugh, then pulled back to see his face. \u201cI love you, you know,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cEven when I\u2019m a bitch, I still love you.\u201d</p><p>Raphael touched his lips to hers in a lingering kiss. \u201cAnd I love you, my Cyn. Always and forever.\u201d</p><p>The big vehicle rolled away from the airport, winding its way down the hill to Marina del Rey and through Santa Monica before they finally hit Pacific Coast Highway. Raphael held her against his side the entire ride, one hand stroking absently up and down her arm, as he stared at the dark city rushing past. Cyn was quiet, too, content to be with him, and to know that, like her, his thoughts were with Duncan far overhead as he winged his way into the most dangerous challenge of his long life.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>A few miles outside Washington, D.C.</p><p>The Learjet rolled up to the darkened hangar, a pale ghost of a plane appearing out of the shadows of a moonless night. Miguel Martinez scanned the private airfield, his vampire sight piercing the near darkness easily. The place was nearly abandoned. No one around but the lone tower controller who\u2019d been paid well to look the other way and ask no questions.</p><p>He returned his gaze to the arriving jet. It was running nearly as dark as the night, with nothing but the gleam of the cockpit\u2019s instrument panel through the windshield to light the pilot\u2019s way into the black interior of the hangar. It should have been impossible. It would have been if the pilots had been human. But, like Miguel, they were vampires and starlight was enough to see by.</p><p>The aircraft eased to a gentle stop, its engines a loud burr of sound that hurt the ears and echoed off the flat spaces and high walls of the empty hangar. The pilot shut down the engines and the sudden silence was nearly as shocking as the noise had been.</p><p>Miguel crossed the bare concrete of the hangar, nerves singing with excitement, with the awareness that his Sire was here at last. He fisted his hands at his sides and straightened his back, determined to make a good impression, to prove himself worthy of the honor he\u2019d been given.</p><p>The hatch opened. Miguel took one step and then another, until he was only a few feet from the open door. The stairs deployed with a hydraulic hiss.</p><p>A figure appeared in the hatchway, a tall and broad-shouldered male, little more than a darker shadow against the unlit interior. He paused briefly before ducking his head to clear the low overhead, then took the stairs downward quickly and with purpose.</p><p>Miguel went to one knee. \u201cSire,\u201d he said reverently, pleased that his voice revealed none of the jittery nerves making his muscles twitch beneath his finely tailored suit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiguel.\u201d A hand touched the back of his head. \u201cNow, get up and give me a proper greeting.\u201d</p><p>There was laughter in his Sire\u2019s voice, and Miguel jumped to his feet with a grin, reaching out to take the proffered hand, feeling himself pulled into a quick embrace.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d Miguel said. \u201cIt\u2019s so very good to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVictor?\u201d Duncan asked, as they strode directly to the BMW Miguel had left idling on the far side of the hangar.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at the house, hosting a small dinner party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. The only vamps he keeps around are his four guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe humans will have to be dealt with, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a problem, my lord,\u201d Miguel said as he dropped into the driver\u2019s seat of the sumptuous vehicle. \u201cLouis and I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Louis?\u201d Duncan asked, closing the passenger side door with a muted thump.</p><p>\u201cWaiting outside the house, keeping an eye on things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou anticipate trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but tonight\u2019s too important to leave to chance.\u201d</p><p>Miguel drove out of the hangar and made a sharp right turn toward the access road. Duncan saw the doors of the hangar begin to close behind them almost immediately.</p> <p>\u201cHow was your journey, my lord?\u201d Miguel asked.</p><p>\u201cUneventful. Raphael sends his regards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Duncan said, settling in for the drive back to the city. \u201cWhat do I need to know about Victor\u2019s setup tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as always. He has his four vampire guards, two in his presence, two on guard elsewhere inside the house. They\u2019re complacent in the routine, and the two not with Victor personally usually sit in a room near the front door, watching TV or playing video games. I\u2019ve never seen them leave the house unless Victor\u2019s with them. Exterior security, including the gate, is handled by humans around the clock, and they\u2019re never permitted inside the residence. There\u2019s a guest house that\u2019s set up as a barracks if the human guards want it, but most of them have homes of their own and go there at the end of their shift. The estate is walled, with the only gate locked down during the day. At night, the human guards pretty much limit their duties to guarding the gate, with only the occasional perimeter patrol.\u201d</p><p>An accident had snarled traffic on the Beltway, and Miguel zipped across several lanes, utilizing the lightning fast reflexes granted by his vampire blood. Duncan grinned. \u201cStill a terrible driver, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true, my lord. The accident was already there.\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed, but sobered immediately. \u201cWhat about Victor\u2019s guests?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small dinner party, just Victor and three humans\u2014a couple of legislators and a K Street scumbag with lots of money to hand out. All males, which is par for the course with Victor. As far as I know, he has no plans to bring in any women tonight, but even if he did, it wouldn\u2019t be until much later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProstitutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Not most of them, anyway. There\u2019s no shortage of women in this city who will party with a man if he\u2019s got enough power. And power is what matters here. Money goes hand in hand, but power means access, and that\u2019s everyone\u2019s number one prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. You and Louis handle the human gate guards. I\u2019ll take care of Victor\u2019s two vampires at the front door. That needs to be done quickly and carefully so he doesn\u2019t sense anything amiss too soon. Once we reach the dining room, I\u2019ll deal with the human dinner guests. I want them out of the way. After that, Victor has to be mine, but we can play it by ear when it comes to taking down his remaining two vampires. You need to be ready to deal with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, we can wash the human gate guards\u2019 memories after Victor is taken care of. Let Louis and me deal with the vamp guards at the door, while you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Duncan turned to look at Miguel, keeping his voice even, but frosting it with the slightest touch of his power. \u201cI want the humans secured first, Miguel. I can handle Victor and his guards, if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>They turned off the Beltway, zipping down streets one after the other, all of them nearly empty late on a Tuesday night. Duncan had studied maps of the neighborhood, but it wasn\u2019t the same as being here. He\u2019d also memorized floor plans of the vampires\u2019 official residence in the city. Some humans referred to the house as the vampire embassy, which was a good enough, if inaccurate, description.</p><p>The residence itself was a big 19th century colonial that in pictures reminded Duncan of the great mansions of his youth in the Deep South. He could only hope this particular house had enjoyed significant renovation since its construction a hundred years ago. If not, it would soon. He had no intention of living with cranky plumbing or nonexistent air conditioning.</p><p>Fortunately, the residence sat on an unusually large parcel of land adjacent to the embassy district. With two full acres backed by Rock Creek, a wall surrounding the entire property and only a single gate, the estate should have been nearly impregnable. But it wasn\u2019t. There were holes in the house\u2019s security that one could literally drive a truck through. And that, too, would change once Duncan took over.</p><p>Because the vampire embassy was about to get a new ambassador. They just didn\u2019t know it yet.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Miguel called Louis on his cell to let him know they were coming in. When they made the final turn, Louis was waiting in the middle of the street, his pale eyes gleaming nearly white in the headlights. He grinned when he saw them and stepped to the side so that Miguel could pull up next to him.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Louis said as he climbed into the back seat. \u201cThank you for letting me be a part of this.\u201d</p><p>Duncan turned around enough to hold out his hand. Louis took it carefully at first, then gripped it tightly when Duncan did the same. Duncan could feel the calluses on Louis\u2019s palm and fingers from the weights he\u2019d lifted most of his life, even before Duncan had turned him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Louis. As I told Miguel, the two of you will take care of the humans at the gate, while I deal with the vampire guards just inside the residence. And once we get into dining room, I want the humans out of there. I can hold off Victor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, all four of Victor\u2019s guards will be inside the house with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that,\u201d Duncan said. He held back a smile as he remembered all the times he\u2019d been overly protective of Raphael\u2014and how much it had irritated the Western Vampire Lord.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the house in the cul-de-sac, my lord,\u201d Miguel said, his voice tight with anticipation as they drew closer to the estate.</p><p>Duncan turned to get his first in-person view of the residence. It didn\u2019t look like a fortified embassy. With cherry trees peeking over the top of a too-short perimeter wall and two chimneys puffing white smoke into the cold air, it looked more like a place where Mom and Dad were raising their 2.5 children and letting the dogs run in the yard. Assuming Mom and Dad had a whole lot of money and enough paranoia to build a wall around their home, even a short one.</p><p>\u201cTime to rock and roll,\u201d Louis whispered, and Duncan smiled grimly.</p><p>They rolled up to the wrought-iron gate, and Miguel dropped his side window with a faint buzz of sound. Frosty air rushed in, and Duncan smelled the creek which ran behind the house, along with a faint hint of snow. All of that disappeared beneath the overwhelming scent of human as the guard bent into the window to check them out.</p><p>Miguel had been on the premises once before, ostensibly to offer his services when he\u2019d first moved here from California and set up a security business in Virginia. \u201cMiguel Martinez,\u201d he told the guard. \u201cLord Victor is expecting us.\u201d</p><p>The human opened his mouth to say something, probably to protest that he wasn\u2019t aware of Lord Victor expecting anyone, but then his eyes glazed over and he blinked slowly. He smiled and nodded, waving them in.</p><p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t the droids you\u2019re looking for,\u201d Louis murmured from the back seat.</p><p>Miguel nearly choked on a laugh as the guard stepped back into the shed and triggered the gate mechanism.</p><p>\u201cEnough, gentlemen,\u201d Duncan said quietly. He understood their excitement. His own blood was thundering with anticipation. But this was a dangerous thing they were about to do, and he didn\u2019t want them to fool themselves into thinking otherwise.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, my lord,\u201d Louis breathed.</p><p>Duncan nodded, but his attention was already on the big, white house, his power reaching out to lightly touch the vampires inside. All but Victor. The others wouldn\u2019t notice his touch, but Victor might.</p><p>\u201cVery lax security,\u201d he commented mostly to himself. \u201cTwo vampires together inside, near the front door.\u201d He frowned. There was a buzz of something, some underlying power that confused him. He wanted to explore it further, but there was no time, and it was too weak and unfocused to represent a danger to his plans for the evening. It would have to wait.</p><p>\u201cMiguel,\u201d he said, \u201cyou and Louis take out the remaining human guards gently. Check the barracks, as well. I don\u2019t want anyone raising an alarm, but there\u2019s no reason to hurt them either. Then join me inside. We\u2019ll take the dining room together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Duncan opened the car door while Miguel was still braking. He sped up the brick steps two at a time, sending a tight needle of power ahead of him to burn out the electronic lock on the front door. The security bolts released with a solid thunk and the door swung open. Duncan stepped inside, his eyes doing a fast sweep of the area while the two vampires on guard were still dragging their attention from the big screen TV to stare at him in surprise. He didn\u2019t wait for them to recover their wits. He reached out with his power and seized their hearts, squeezing until they dropped to the floor. They weren\u2019t dead. Victor was corrupt, but he wasn\u2019t weak. As the Sire of these two vampires, and especially at such close proximity, he would certainly feel it if they died, and he\u2019d know something was wrong. So Duncan let them live for now. But when Victor died, these two vampires would die right along with him, most likely drained dry by Victor himself in a bid to survive Duncan\u2019s challenge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Duncan had met Victor on more than one occasion when he\u2019d accompanied Raphael to Vampire Council meetings, but he\u2019d never matched strength with the vampire lord directly. The annual gatherings were carefully orchestrated affairs, bringing together the most powerful vampires in North America, vampires who were natural rivals at best and enemies at worst. Everyone was on their best behavior at those affairs, which meant there were no outright challenges and no blatant weighings of each other\u2019s power.</p><p>But Raphael had known Victor a long time, and there were other ways to measure the depth of a vampire\u2019s power. The upshot was that Duncan knew he could defeat Victor because Raphael wouldn\u2019t have risked him otherwise. And, more importantly, because he knew the depths of his own power. Victor would be ousted from his rule over the territory tonight in the usual vampire way . . . by assassination.</p><p>Miguel and Louis rushed through the front door behind him, their power brimming and ready to defend him if necessary. Again, it felt odd to be the recipient of that sort of devotion rather than the other way around. Something he\u2019d have to get used to.</p> <p>\u201cAny problems?\u201d he asked as his vampires hid the limp bodies of Victor\u2019s two guards behind the same couch they\u2019d been sitting on when Duncan arrived.</p><p>Miguel let his burden drop, the comatose vampire\u2019s head cracking loudly against the wooden floor. \u201cNone, my lord. The gate is secured, the barracks empty. And all of the human guards on the estate are sound asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. This is it, then. Remember, once we\u2019re in the dining room, I\u2019ll put the humans under immediately. After that, we play it by ear. I don\u2019t care which of us takes down the two remaining vamp guards, but Victor himself is mine alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYes, my lord.\u201d Miguel was fairly bouncing on his toes. Louis stood as still as a statue, his muscles coiled for action. He nodded sharply, his eyes fixed on Duncan like a dog on point, awaiting the go-ahead.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Duncan said.</p> <p>Miguel walked ahead of him, Louis behind. They went past the staircase and turned left down a long hallway, their footsteps nearly silent despite the old, wood plank floor. Doors stood open left and right, revealing rooms filled with furniture\u2014a formal dining room with a table that could have seated thirty people easily, and a den or game room with another huge flat screen TV, several different video game consoles, and a foosball table in the corner. There was a spacious kitchen with open containers littering the counter tops and still smelling of the food Victor had brought in for his human guests. Duncan\u2019s research told him Victor typically had his parties catered, with his vampires serving as waiters where necessary. It wasn\u2019t particularly elegant, but then Duncan doubted it was a zeal for good food that brought the humans here in the first place.</p><p>The dining room they wanted\u2014the one Victor was using tonight\u2014was at the very end of the hallway, behind a pair of white pocket doors. Miguel reached for the doors and paused, hands resting lightly on the bronze handles.</p><p>Duncan tilted his head, listening with both his ears and his power. The conversation from inside was loud and boisterous, the human voices evidencing clear signs of intoxication or drugs. It could be either. Victor was here, too, his mind lazy and at ease, not expecting any trouble. His remaining two vampire guards were far more alert than their Sire, but at the same time they took their cue from him, and their minds were wandering, not at all concerned about what was going on in the room or out of it. What little attention they were paying was focused on the human guests, seeing them more as prey than anything else, while trusting that their now comatose fellow guards at the front of the house would alert them to any outside threat.</p><p>Duncan pulled back his probe, drew a breath and gave Miguel a quick nod of assent.</p><p>Miguel slid the door back and Duncan stepped through.</p><p>Conversation stopped dead as everyone turned to stare at him. Duncan gestured, and the three humans went glassy-eyed, their heads slumping to their chests in unconsciousness, one sliding to the floor beneath the table, while the others merely fell forward into the remnants of their dinner.</p> <p>Victor\u2019s guards recovered before the first human\u2019s head hit the table, one of them vaulting the table, crystal flying and dishes breaking as he raced to protect his Sire. Miguel caught him in midair, his fingers digging into the other vampire\u2019s throat as he threw him to the floor and punched his chest hard enough to stop his heart in an instant. Victor\u2019s vampire gasped, eyes bulging, as he struggled to gather his power back into himself, to force his heart to pump once more. Given only a moment longer, it might have worked, but Miguel didn\u2019t grant him that moment. He grabbed an empty chair and smashed it against the floor until it produced what he needed. The piece of wood was jagged and raw, half varnished and half bare wood, but it was the perfect weapon. Miguel lifted the stake with a fang-baring grin of anticipation, and Victor\u2019s guard keened a wordless plea, the only noise he could still manage. Miguel brought the stake down in a single clean stroke, granting the only mercy he would\u2014a quick death.</p><p>Louis and the other vampire guard were still battling one another, blood flowing as they exchanged brutal blows that would have killed a human with the first strike. Louis slammed his opponent into the wall, cracking the wainscoting and leaving a vampire-sized dent in the upper wall as plaster dust filled the air. Victor\u2019s vampire bellowed in anger. He tightened his grip, his fingers digging into Louis\u2019s arms as he tried to reverse their positions, but Louis used the vampire\u2019s momentum against him, spinning around completely and throwing him across the room. He crashed into one of the unconscious humans as he hit the table, eliciting an unwilling grunt of reaction.</p><p>Duncan felt more than saw Victor move, felt the vampire lord begin to gather his power. He glanced up, meeting Victor\u2019s reptilian gaze. The two powerful vampires studied each other for a long breath, but a sharp cry of denial drew their eyes to Louis and the remaining guard in time to see Louis impale his opponent with a jagged spear of wood.</p><p>Victor sucked in a breath as his vampire died, and Duncan turned in time to see the vampire lord slump forward, his fist clenched to his chest. As if he felt Duncan\u2019s gaze upon him, Victor relaxed his hand and raised his head with a defiant glare, showing no weakness to his enemy.</p><p>\u201cThis was unnecessary,\u201d Duncan observed after a moment, stepping back from the two piles of vampire dust with exaggerated distaste. He looked up and met Victor\u2019s angry gaze once more. \u201cYou should have taught them better, Victor.\u201d</p><p>At the head of the table, Victor remained perfectly still, his stare burning with hatred as a haze of crimson power began to seep over his brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cMiguel,\u201d Duncan said, removing his overcoat and throwing it onto a nearby chair. \u201cGet these humans out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Miguel murmured.</p> <p>Louis reached under the table and yanked the fallen human out from under it, pulling him into a fireman\u2019s carry and heading down the hallway. Miguel dragged another of the guests\u2014a large, florid man whom Duncan recognized as a U.S. Senator\u2014through the doors, then came back and hefted the last human over his shoulder, before following Louis.</p><p>Duncan pulled the pocket doors shut, selected a chair that wasn\u2019t covered in broken dishes or food, and sat, crossing his legs at the knee. He scanned the room idly as he sat there, intentionally ignoring Victor\u2019s growing outrage. It was a small room, too narrow and, like all the others, crowded with too much furniture. The air reeked of cigar smoke and spilled food.</p><p>\u201cSo, Victor,\u201d Duncan said, finally turning his attention to the other vampire. \u201cHow are things in Washington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Duncan,\u201d Victor growled. \u201cYou can\u2019t come in here and start killing my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, I can,\u201d Duncan pointed out.</p><p>Victor snorted a dismissive laugh. \u201cYou? You\u2019d never have dared this without Raphael.\u201d He spat to one side. \u201cWhere is the great man anyway?\u201d He lifted his head as if sniffing the air. \u201cHe\u2019s not nearby; I\u2019d sense him if he\u2019d crossed into my territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have sensed me, Victor. You\u2019ve grown complacent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing but Raphael\u2019s lap dog. I don\u2019t waste my time on mutts.\u201d</p><p>Duncan merely smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s like this, Victor. We can do it the easy way or the hard way. The choice is yours.\u201d</p><p>A vicious grin split Victor\u2019s broad face as he stood and kicked his chair against the wall. He leaned forward, fangs bared and hands resting on the table as his power began to build, his eyes now gleaming like two burning coals of fury.</p><p>\u201cGive it your best shot, puppy.\u201d</p><p>Duncan dipped his head in agreement. \u201cThe hard way it is then.\u201d He stood, and for the first time since he\u2019d left California, the first time in the presence of anyone but Raphael and the California lord\u2019s most trusted vampires, Duncan loosed the full measure of his power. He let it build until it was a firestorm in his chest, the pressure both excruciating and exhilarating. Lights flickered as energy danced around the room.</p><p>Duncan blinked lazily and met Victor\u2019s surprised stare with a quiet question. \u201cYou were saying?\u201d</p><p>With a roar of defiance, Victor launched a preemptive volley, a tight ball of incredible energy that must have drawn heavily on his power. It was a bid to weaken Duncan before he was ready, before he could muster his own power into a shield around himself. But Duncan had trained with the best the vampire world had to offer. His shields snapped closed with a concussion of sound. Victor\u2019s attack slammed into them with tremendous force. They flexed, but held, and Duncan flicked both hands forward, as if brushing away Victor\u2019s assault, a move calculated to enrage the other vampire lord.</p><p>Victor growled, his teeth grinding together as he smashed one thick fist into the table, amplifying the blow with his power and shattering the whole thing into kindling. He looked up and grinned at Duncan, then raised both hands flat in the air, palms up, lifting the bits of splintered table as if it were still whole. With another power-filled gesture, he flung all of the shards at Duncan, a flying wave of deadly sharp wooden stakes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a clever move. Duncan admired it even as he defended against it, twisting the power of his shields into a whirlwind of energy that sent most of the table shards whipping out in all directions while others exploded upon impact into harmless matchsticks.</p><p>Victor was sweating blood and shaking with fury, his shields weakening perceptibly. Duncan suspected the other vampire had concentrated too much of his reserve power into that first preemptive strike, but Victor wasn\u2019t done yet. His shields might be weaker, but they held against Duncan\u2019s discreet probes. Duncan frowned as Victor\u2019s power suddenly surged, as if he was drawing energy from somewhere outside the room. But the most likely source of that sort of power would be Victor\u2019s vampire children, and two of them were already piles of dust, with the other two near death. Even if Victor had drained them dry, they couldn\u2019t have given him this much of a power boost. Did Victor have minions they hadn\u2019t uncovered? Someone beyond the four that had been with him for centuries? Impossible, unless . . .</p><p>Duncan concentrated, remembering that odd buzz of power he\u2019d felt as they approached the house. He spared a bit of power, a fraction of his awareness, and searched the house, looking for the source of that buzz. It had to be here somewhere, and it had to be what Victor was feeding from. There! In the basement, there were . . . Duncan\u2019s eyes widened first in shock, then in revulsion as he looked up and met the old vampire lord\u2019s confident glare.</p> <p>\u201cAbomination!\u201dDuncan hissed.</p><p>Victor laughed. \u201cWhat a self-righteous little prick you are. I created them, and they live to serve me like any other.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s stomach turned. Victor had made vampires for the sole purpose of feeding his own power. There were at least twenty of them down there, trapped in the basement, half-starved, mindless, little better than feral animals, existing only to provide Victor with enough strength to hold onto his territory. It was a practice forbidden by the very Council Victor was a member of, and it was precisely what Duncan had called it\u2014abomination.</p><p>Victor grinned maliciously. \u201cStill think you can take me, puppy?\u201d</p><p>Duncan felt his purpose harden into granite, his anger turn to cold intent. With a quick warning, he drew power from his own children, from Miguel and Louis. They sensed his need and gave it willingly, the two of them together far stronger than all of Victor\u2019s half-mad slaves, no matter how many there were.</p> <p>Victor\u2019s victorious grin wilted, and Duncan saw awareness of his impending doom in the other vampire lord\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYield,\u201d Duncan offered, \u201cand I\u2019ll make the end painless. For you and for those poor wretches downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d Victor snarled. He drew himself up, sucking up every last ounce of power remaining in the slaves in the basement, finally draining the two guards Duncan had left alive. Combining that with what was left of his own power, he fed it all into a wall before him as he advanced physically on Duncan. He held a long, jagged piece of wood in one hand, his fingers gripping it so tightly that it sliced his skin, blood dripping between his fingers and running down his arm.</p><p>With a howl of rage, he rushed the last few feet, the rudimentary pike up and ready, his power a battering ram before him.</p><p>Duncan waited until the other vampire was nearly upon him, and then he clenched his right fist and punched it straight out before him as though slamming it into Victor\u2019s chest. A thunderbolt of power hit the other vampire\u2019s shields. Duncan felt them crack under the impact of his strike, heard the shattering of crystal as Victor\u2019s shields broke under the strain.</p><p>And he heard the mindless shrieking of those poor souls in the basement as their world collapsed.</p> <p>Victor staggered, his face gray with shock, the red haze of power in his eyes already beginning to drain away, leaving them a dull brown. The stake he\u2019d been gripping fell from limp fingers as he crumpled to the floor, first to his knees and then lower as he fell back to sit on his heels, hands hanging limply by his sides.</p><p>He looked up as Duncan crouched next to him, barely able to meet Duncan\u2019s gaze as his head lolled weakly backward.</p><p>\u201cYou should have taken the easy way, Victor,\u201d Duncan said, breathing hard from his own exertion.</p><p>Victor grinned one last time, blood staining his teeth and dripping down his chin. \u201cFuck you, Duncan,\u201d he rasped harshly.</p><p>Duncan laughed. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>He slammed his fist into Victor\u2019s torso, ripping through skin and bone, to wrap his fingers around the vampire\u2019s beating heart and yank it out of his chest. As Victor sucked in a final groaning breath, Duncan held the still-beating heart before his eyes and sent a concentrated blast of power directly into the pulsing organ.</p><p>Victor shrieked as his heart burst into flames, as his body began to disintegrate, as he became nothing more than a pile of ash to mix with the broken china and crushed food of the too small room. In a far away faint echo of their Sire\u2019s passing, Victor\u2019s two remaining vampire guards\u2014the two he\u2019d left lying in a room near the front door\u2014died along with their Sire, as did the pathetic creatures in the basement, falling into dust with barely a whisper.</p><p>Duncan started to stand, but he fell back to his knees as frantic cries filled his head, the vampires of Victor\u2019s territory screaming out for their Master, pleading for reassurance and understanding, begging to know what was happening. Duncan closed his eyes, groaning at the overwhelming flood of impressions, details, identities, hopes, wants. Raphael had told him what to expect when Victor died, when the burden of lordship fell upon Duncan, but nothing could have prepared him for the physical weight of it, for this sucking whirlpool of need that would bleed him dry if he didn\u2019t do something.</p> <p>Throwing his head back, eyes still closed, he roared out a command for silence. As if cut by a blade, the flood of demands stopped dead. Duncan drew a deep breath and, despite his exhaustion, let his power flow out to every vampire in the territory, offering surety, offering support, letting them know that they had a new Master, but he was strong enough to take care of them. And that he would tolerate no rebellion, that challengers would die if they faced him.</p><p>Slowly he withdrew. The bond was established and it was strong. The territory\u2019s vampires were still there, a whisper of presence in his mind, like the nearly silent voices of an empty church. It was a weight on his heart that oddly reminded him of the first time he\u2019d known he loved someone, that constant pressure in one\u2019s chest that is both a welcome presence and a frightening reminder of the persistent vulnerability that comes with love.</p><p>There were those among his new territory\u2019s vampires\u2014his vampires, now\u2014who remained uneasy, but that was expected. There were others who were curious enough that he knew they\u2019d show up in the coming days, perhaps even to test his power, to see if he was as strong as he seemed. And that was expected, as well. But in the final analysis, no one had died\u2014beyond Victor and his four bodyguards, and those pathetic creatures in the basement, who never should have been created at all\u2014and that was a victory. The Capital Territory was small, only encompassing the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Several hundred vampires lived in those states, many of whom had been there longer than Duncan had been alive. He had taken the territory with relatively few meaningful deaths, but it remained to be seen if he could hold onto it without the need to kill a few more.</p><p>Footsteps thundered down the hallway behind him with unnatural speed. There was no need to turn around to know that it was Miguel and Louis, responding to his distress and ready to defend him. The two of them were his only children for now, although there would soon be more. But they would always be the first. He\u2019d turned them both fifty years ago, when he and Raphael had decided to take the first real steps toward this day.</p><p>Victor had been right about one thing. Raphael supported this move. Victor\u2019s corruption had long chafed at Raphael, especially in the last few years, when it had become more and more difficult to maintain the secrecy of vampire existence. Victor\u2019s excesses had become an embarrassment and worse to the vampire community he was supposed to represent in the U. S. capital. But it wasn\u2019t until the recent alliances with both Rajmund and Sophia had been cemented that Raphael and Duncan had decided the time was finally right to make a move against the powerful Washington, D.C. Vampire Lord. It was time to install someone Raphael trusted, someone who shared his larger vision of the future of vampires on this continent, someone powerful enough to take on Victor and win.</p><p>If Duncan had asked for it, Raphael would have gladly lent him an army of vampires to take with him to D.C. But it had been important to Duncan to seize the territory on his own, with his own people. Miguel and Louis were his, and they would always be the ones who\u2019d stood with him when this all began.</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d Miguel skidded into the room first, going to his knees next to where Duncan still knelt on the filthy floor. \u201cSire, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Duncan smiled. \u201cThe territory is ours.\u201d He stood, letting Miguel give him a hand up, and then turned to include Louis. \u201cAnd now the real work begins.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Emma Duquet parked her small Honda beneath a winter-bare cherry tree and stared at the elegant white mansion down the block. It was all lit up, sitting there like a queen lording it over the rest of the houses\u2014the biggest lot and the biggest house on a block of big houses. Even the tiniest home on this street probably cost more than she\u2019d earn in a lifetime. She frowned. Well, maybe not an entire lifetime. She planned to live long and well, if only to spite the Fates which seemed to have been against her so far.</p><p>A dump truck lumbered past, its headlights picking out the incongruous pile of debris sitting inside the house\u2019s fancy iron gate. In her neighborhood, that trash would have been dumped right on the street for pickup, but they probably had codes about that sort of thing around here.</p><p>The driver of the truck leaned out to speak into a receiver on the side of the mansion\u2019s small guard house, obviously announcing his arrival since the guard house itself was empty. The gate rolled open, but instead of driving forward, the truck reversed into a quick three point turn before backing through the gate and stopping with the rear of the truck bed right next to the pile of junk. Not seeming to care that their truck kept the gate from closing, two men jumped out and began tossing junk from the debris pile into the open bed of their vehicle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma watched curiously, wishing she\u2019d thought to bring some binoculars with her. On second thought, sitting in this district and staring through binoculars might get her arrested. For that matter, she\u2019d better do something besides sit here, or someone would call the police on her. Washington was a very paranoid place these days.</p><p>Decision time. The gate was open, a golden opportunity if ever there was one. She could waltz right up to the front door of the vampire embassy and request an audience with the ambassador or whatever the hell they called him. She\u2019d probably never get a better shot than this. Of course, it was also possible she\u2019d waltz through the gate and into the arms of some angry guards. Maybe even a dog or two. Although, she didn\u2019t see any dogs and besides, the stories all said dogs didn\u2019t like vampires. Plus, with the gate open like that, if there were dogs, they\u2019d surely be\u2014</p><p>\u201cSnap out of it, Em,\u201d she scolded herself. She had a tendency to overthink things as a way of postponing the inevitable. And this visit was definitely inevitable. Her roommate Lacey was missing, and Emma had run into a brick wall in her own attempts to find her. But someone in that house knew exactly where Lacey was, and Emma intended to find out.</p> <p>She got out of her car and looked around. No one was watching. She hurried down the street, slowing as she neared the battered truck. Changing her quick dash into a brisk, confident walk, she strode past the two busy men with a nod and a smile, as if she came this way every night.</p><p>The driveway was one of those long curving things, and between her nerves and the three inch heels she\u2019d worn to work, she was a bit winded by the time she reached the pretty brick stairs. She paused at their foot and drew a calming breath.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this, Em,\u201d she whispered and took the stairs at a quick trot.</p><p>She reached the front door and stared in surprise. The lock had been destroyed. It looked like someone had fried it. Weird. But convenient. Between that and the open gate, the gods were clearly smiling on her mission tonight. She touched the knob delicately to be sure it was safe, then pushed the door open and stepped inside.</p><p>It was dark, although not spooky dark. There were a few lights down a hall that disappeared behind the big staircase right opposite the door. And a crystal chandelier overhead that looked as if it was on its dimmest setting. The crystals gleamed a yellowish gray, as though the light was not strong enough to punch through the glass.</p> <p>Emma took another step inside, shivered, and closed the door behind her. It was surprisingly warm, despite the shadowy lighting. A part of her had expected it to be as cold as a tomb, like with the vampires from the movies. But there was a pleasant fire burning in the room to her right, the sight of which had been blocked by the open front door. The room had the look of a small library and was softly lit by pretty Tiffany-style lamps which were perched on a desk and on two small, round side tables. She heard the distinctive sound of someone sliding a book back onto a shelf and took a tentative step toward the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she called softly, somehow reluctant to announce her presence in this big empty-feeling house. She tiptoed closer to the room and shrieked, jumping back and nearly tripping on her own heels as a big, blond man suddenly stepped into view.</p><p>He eyed her curiously, his full lips curving into a faint smile. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d His voice was smooth and easy, and it brought to mind the cool water running in gentle mountain streams back home.</p><p>Emma stared at him. He could definitely help her, but probably not in the way he meant. Emma liked tall guys, not giant tall, but tall enough that at five-six she could still wear high heels without being taller than her date. Not that she had that many dates with her work schedule, but one could always hope.</p><p>This guy was more than just tall, though. He was lovely. Late twenties, maybe a bit over six foot, with long blond hair falling loosely over broad shoulders. He had strong arms and a taut, muscled chest that filled out a dark blue, long-sleeved t-shirt and tapered down to a tight, flat abdomen. Faded denims clung to narrow hips and muscular thighs, and . . .</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he repeated in that same soothing voice, but with an undercurrent of amusement. \u201cDid you want something in particular?\u201d</p> <p>Emma flushed, embarrassed at being caught ogling. What was she thinking? She wasn\u2019t here to pick up some guy, no matter how delicious he was.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she started, then, discovering her throat was too dry to talk, swallowed. She coughed and started again. \u201cYes, I\u2019d like to see the ambassador, please.\u201d</p><p>Warm brown eyes crinkled at the corners. \u201cYou may have noticed,\u201d he said, his gaze sweeping over what she could see of the obviously not-open-for-business embassy, \u201cthat we\u2019re in transition here. The old ambassador has been called home. However, his replacement will be in place soon, and when he is, I\u2019m quite certain he\u2019ll be happy to meet with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Emma said, suddenly worried. \u201cYou mean Victor\u2019s gone? Like for good?\u201d When he nodded, she asked, \u201cHow long will it be before I can meet with whoever\u2019s in charge then?\u201d</p><p>The blond tipped his head to one side appraisingly. Was he trying to decide if she was worth disturbing the new guy? Emma straightened self-consciously, wanting him to know she was a serious person, here on business, which might seem questionable after her earlier bout of hormonal gawking.</p><p>\u201cCan you wait a few moments?\u201d the hunk asked.</p><p>Emma jerked in surprise. \u201cSure,\u201d she said immediately. \u201cI mean, yes, of course. Uh, where do you want me to wait?\u201d She glanced around, then leaned to one side, looking past him into the library, which appeared to be full of intriguing books.</p><p>Oddly, the blond didn\u2019t seem to know where to put her while he went to check on the new ambassador\u2019s whereabouts. Maybe he\u2019d arrived with the new guy. An unwelcome thought popped up its horny head. Considering the way he was dressed and his total fitness and general hunkiness, maybe he was the new guy\u2019s boyfriend. Damn. Why were all the gorgeous guys gay?</p> <p>The blond suddenly grinned, as if he knew what she was thinking. \u201cYou can wait in\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fast, heavy footsteps thudded from somewhere deep in the house moments before a dark-haired man barreled in from the hallway behind the stairs. Moving incredibly fast, he did a standing slide and stopped in front of the blond like a runner into home plate.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Miguel,\u201d the blond interrupted. \u201cThis young lady . . .\u201d He turned to look at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t get your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. No, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI should have introduced myself. Emma Duquet.\u201d She stepped forward and held out her hand.</p><p>The blond carefully took her hand into his, as if afraid he\u2019d crush it. And maybe he could have, because his hands were just like the rest of him\u2014beautiful and big, with broad palms and square fingers. Hard, too, not soft and pillowy like so many of the men here in Washington. Those strong fingers curled around hers and he squeezed gently, his grip lingering a touch longer than would have been perfectly polite. But who cared about polite? Emma was in love, or at least lust. Maybe he wasn\u2019t gay after all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Duncan,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is Miguel.\u201d</p><p>No last names for either of them. Huh. Weird. Maybe it was a vampire thing, although she was pretty sure neither one of these guys was a vampire. Not that she knew what a vampire looked like\u2014that was more Lacey\u2019s thing. But these two looked more like frat boys getting ready for a party than all-powerful masters of the universe.</p><p>She offered her hand to Miguel in turn, but he only stared at it suspiciously and stepped between her and Duncan as if she had a disease or something.</p><p>\u201cShe can wait in the library, Miguel.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired man gave Duncan a surprised look.</p><p>\u201cThe ambassador will definitely want to see her,\u201d Duncan added, glancing her way with a quick there-and-gone smile.</p><p>Miguel\u2019s eyebrows shot up, taking his whole hairline along for the ride.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll make Ms. Duquet comfortable,\u201d Duncan was saying, \u201cI\u2019ll see to the ambassador.\u201d</p><p>Emma watched as Duncan disappeared back the way Miguel had come. He moved like a big, graceful cat, the way professional athletes moved, as if every muscle was in tune with all the others. And such a pleasure to watch, too.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Miguel said, interrupting her admiration of Duncan\u2019s departing studliness. He was frowning when she looked back at him. Miguel didn\u2019t seem to like her for some reason. No, it was more like he didn\u2019t approve of her. Well, tough. Emma didn\u2019t look for anyone\u2019s approval but her own. And she sure as hell hadn\u2019t clawed her way through college and law school in order to worry about what some diplomatic flunky thought about her. Besides, she wasn\u2019t here to make friends.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, and strolled confidently into the library as if she owned the place.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Miguel said, making it sound more like an order than an invitation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stand,\u201d Emma said. She actually would rather have sat, but she wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction. \u201cOkay if I look around?\u201d</p><p>Miguel\u2019s frown deepened. He scanned the room carefully, as if looking for things she might sneak into her pockets on the way out. Emma just gave him a droll look. For God\u2019s sake, this was obviously intended to be a waiting room for visitors. Look how close it was to the front door! If they were going to hide the embassy treasures, it wasn\u2019t going to be in this room, was it? Get a clue!</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\u2019ll be nearby.\u201d</p><p>Emma smiled. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stripped off the comfortable denims and t-shirt he\u2019d been wearing, albeit not without a regretful sigh. The confrontation with Victor had been less than twenty-four hours ago, and he\u2019d hoped for at least a few days of privacy before the outside world intruded. They were still working on security, still searching every inch of this huge house for eavesdropping devices, hidden cameras, concealed doors and escape routes. It would be easier once the rest of Duncan\u2019s team arrived from California later tonight. If nothing else, it would be more eyes searching and ears listening. Several of Raphael\u2019s vampires had volunteered to accompany Duncan to this new posting, but he\u2019d taken only a few and only the ones with a deep security background. Everything else could be taken care of later, but the first order of business had to be making this place secure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which brought up the fact of the lovely Ms. Duquet\u2019s unexpected appearance in his front parlor and how she\u2019d managed to get there. As if summoned by the thought, Louis knocked lightly on the door of the bedroom suite that Duncan had taken for himself.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Louis.\u201d</p><p>The stocky vampire cracked the door open just enough to slip through and assumed a parade rest position. Louis now belonged to Duncan body and soul, but before he\u2019d become Vampire, he\u2019d been a soldier, forged in the heat of battle, and he still had fond memories of his days as a military man.</p> <p>Duncan buckled the belt on his suit trousers and sat down to put on a pair of black dress socks. \u201cHow\u2019d she get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dump truck, Sire. They blocked the gate open with their vehicle while they loaded the trash, and she slipped past. I take responsibility for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Duncan sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. The three of us simply aren\u2019t enough to secure an estate of this size. It will be easier after the others get here\u2014and after Miguel brings in the daylight team. In the meantime, I suggest we close the gate and ignore any callers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Duncan pulled on his boots, stomped his feet as he stood, and slipped his suit jacket off the hanger. \u201cHave you checked out the basement yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was on my way when Miguel called me, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Thank you, Louis. I\u2019m sorry to burden you with this. I expect it\u2019s pretty grim down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo apology necessary, my lord. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Louis dipped his head in a bow and slipped out of the room, leaving Duncan to his own thoughts, which immediately filled with images of Emma Duquet. He smiled as he finger-combed his hair back and tied it with a worn leather thong from the many scattered over the dresser top.</p><p>Emma, he thought. A lovely, old-fashioned name, although there was nothing old-fashioned about his visitor. Her long, chestnut colored hair had hung down her back in a wild tangle, and those unusual dark violet eyes had been sharp and intelligent, despite the almost manic energy she seemed to radiate. She wore her severely tailored suit like a knight wore his armor, but it didn\u2019t conceal nearly as much. No knight had ever flashed such shapely legs, nor donned a pair of high heels to make them look even longer than they were. Her legs had been covered in silk stockings, too. This weather was too cold for bare legs, but she hadn\u2019t given in to temptation and worn something less flattering than silk. He understood the need for modern women to wear pants, and thick tights were certainly practical in this climate. But the southern-raised man in him still preferred to see women in skirts and dresses, with the sweet curve of slender calves accented by the sheen of silk. Although, to be sure, no self-respecting woman of his time would have worn anything remotely resembling Emma\u2019s tight-fitting skirt and jacket, nor would they have worn silk stockings where a man other than her husband would ever see them, either. He grinned. Come to think of it, contemporary women\u2019s clothing had much to recommend it, after all.</p><p>And why was he spending so much time worrying about Ms. Duquet\u2019s clothes? He should be wondering instead what she was doing here. And what could be so urgent that her eyes had darkened with fear when he told her Victor was gone?</p><p>Chapter Five</p> <p>Emma paged in awe through the last volume of what appeared to be a complete 1776 first edition of Edward Gibbon\u2019s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. And in remarkable condition, too. She was no rare book expert, but she\u2019d have bet this particular set had never seen the inside of a bookshop. A well-preserved family heirloom was more like it.</p><p>She shook her head, suddenly impatient with herself. Duh, Emma.Vampire. They\u2019d probably bought the whole set fresh off the press and shoved it on a shelf. Probably didn\u2019t even know they had it, much less what it was worth. She slid the book carefully next to the five other volumes and lifted her head, scanning the surrounding titles. She wondered if there were other treasures like that one, just sitting here with no one the wiser.</p><p>\u201cVictor had a remarkable collection,\u201d said a cool voice.</p><p>Emma jumped guiltily and spun around. She stared at Duncan, her mouth hanging open in shock, until she realized it and snapped her jaw shut hard enough that it hurt. The man standing there was Duncan, but it wasn\u2019t him either. The t-shirt and jeans were gone, and didn\u2019t he fill out a suit nicely? Maybe the ambassador required him to dress for visitors, even the uninvited ones.</p><p>She blinked, tilting her head curiously as his words caught up with her thoughts. \u201cYou said had a collection. Past tense. Did something happen to Ambassador Victor? Is that why your boss is here now?\u201d Her heart began to race at the idea that something had happened to Victor. The party Lacey had gone to was one hosted by the vampire ambassador himself, or so Lacey had told Emma. It wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d gone to one of Victor\u2019s parties, but this one was supposed to be something special, a long weekend at a house outside the city. Lacey had been so excited. She\u2019d blown her share of the rent money on a new dress and shoes, knowing Emma would forgive her and cover the whole rent\u2014as always.</p><p>And right now, Emma would happily pay the rent for the next five years if Lacey would just show up safe and sound.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she told Duncan and shook her head to clear it. \u201cUm, right. Past tense. Did something happen to the ambassador?\u201d Or to Lacey?</p> <p>\u201cNothing unexpected, no,\u201d Duncan assured her calmly. \u201cBut the book collection goes with the residence, so it\u2019s not really his anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course. I guess that makes it your boss\u2019s now, right?\u201d</p><p>Duncan smiled, seeming genuinely happy with her conclusion, or maybe it was more like he was amused. She scowled as he turned gracefully and strolled over to the heavy, ornate desk. Miguel slipped into the room like a dark ghost, making no more noise than Duncan had. He\u2019d changed clothes, too, and now took up a position behind Duncan\u2019s left shoulder as Duncan sat behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, Ms. Duquet,\u201d Duncan said, \u201cand tell me what brings you here.\u201d</p><p>Emma looked up in surprise as she settled into the chair. \u201cWait, I thought I was meeting . . .\u201d Shit. Emma barely managed to keep from swearing out loud as she realized what was going on.</p><p>Duncan, meanwhile, turned sideways to the desk, leaning back in the big leather chair and crossing his legs at the knee, one arm on the desk in front of him. He didn\u2019t fidget like some people would have, didn\u2019t tap so much as a single finger on the desk. He just watched her intently, as if curious to see how she would react.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the ambassador?\u201d Emma croaked.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t actually refer to it as an ambassador, but, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means . . . You\u2019re a vampire? But that\u2019s impossible. I mean, how old are you?\u201d</p><p>Miguel stiffened and gave her an outraged glare, but Duncan tsked softly and said, \u201cThat\u2019s a very rude question in vampire culture, Ms. Duquet. You work in this city. At least I assume you do. Surely they\u2019ve taught you to be more delicate than that when dealing with other cultures.\u201d</p><p>Emma narrowed her eyes in irritation. He was right, of course. She did know better than to ask a question like that, but he\u2019d shocked her right out of her cultural awareness classes. And he knew it. He was toying with her, and she didn\u2019t like to be toyed with.</p><p>\u201cLook, Duncan, or whatever your name really is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Miguel actually growled at that, but Duncan raised a hand to stop him. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Miguel. She meant no insult, did you, Ms. Duquet?\u201d</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t answer for a moment. She was too busy staring at Miguel. She\u2019d never heard a man actually growl before. A real, teeth-bared, saliva-dripping, I\u2019m-going-to-rip-your-throat-out growl. Wow.</p><p>\u201cMs. Duquet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I mean, no, I didn\u2019t mean to insult you. I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m usually better than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re worried about something. Something that brought you to see us, even though you\u2019ve never been here before. Something important enough that you snuck through the gate and into our house without invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gate was open,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cThe gate was blocked by a truck actively engaged in loading trash,\u201d Duncan corrected gently. \u201cObviously, it was not supposed to be open.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he had her there. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she conceded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Again.\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed softly, his warm brown eyes dancing. He sure didn\u2019t look like a vampire. Miguel she could buy. He\u2019d growled for God\u2019s sake. Duncan looked like a blue blood Harvard business graduate with an expensive tailor and enough rebellion in his soul to let his hair grow long. But maybe that was the point. What better face to put on the vampire culture than someone who looked like the corporate executive next door?</p><p>\u201cYour problem?\u201dDuncan prompted her.</p><p>Emma drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cMy roommate, Lacey,\u201d she started, then stopped. Lacey was way more than just a roommate, but he didn\u2019t need to know that. \u201cShe went to one of Victor\u2019s parties. It was a weekend thing, but she should have been home by at least Sunday night, because she had to work Monday morning. That was three days ago, and I still haven\u2019t heard from her. Lacey wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Duncan, waiting for him to respond somehow. To tell her everything was okay, that the party was still going on, or they\u2019d decided to take a plane to the Bahamas and there was no cell coverage. Something, anything, to explain Lacey\u2019s silence. He didn\u2019t say anything right away. He sat almost perfectly still, clearly thinking about everything she\u2019d said, but not rushing to respond. It was frustrating for someone like Emma, who tended to live life at full throttle, but at the same time, there was something mesmerizing about his stillness. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever met anyone who could remain so still. She would have attributed it to him being a vampire, except that Miguel, standing right next to him, was fairly bristling with energy, his muscles bunching beneath the lines of his elegant suit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Duncan, on the other hand, was like a big cat\u2014a tiger, maybe\u2014so beautiful and sleek on the outside. But even as you admire his beauty, your heart\u2019s racing with fear, because some part of you knows that this is danger, this is death. There was a coiled power to Duncan, as if it was barely contained within his skin. It demanded all her attention, and yet, outwardly, he was just sitting there, still and quiet, waiting. Just like that tiger.</p><p>Emma wasn\u2019t a tiger. She was always fiddling with something. Her teachers used to scold her constantly for her twitching, as they called it. But the truth was she had too much energy to be still. It would burn her up from the inside if she didn\u2019t use it somehow.</p><p>\u201cWas this the first time your friend joined Victor at one of his events?\u201d Duncan asked.</p> <p>Emma stifled her jerk of surprise at his sudden question. \u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cLacey likes to party. Working and living in D.C. was my idea, but she agreed to come with me for the social scene. There\u2019s a party of some sort almost every night in this town. More than one most nights, and on weekends\u2014\u201d Emma shrugged, then hesitated. She didn\u2019t want to tell Duncan the rest of it, didn\u2019t want him to think badly of Lacey, but . . .</p><p>\u201cLacey\u2019s sort of obsessed with you all,\u201d she added reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYou \u2018all\u2019 what?\u201dDuncan prompted.</p><p>\u201cVampires,\u201d Emma said, wincing. \u201cShe must read ten books a week, absolutely gobbles them up. Paranormal romance mostly, and most of that vampires. She met Victor at a VIP function hosted by the company she works for. They\u2019re a K Street lobbying firm\u2014big, big money. Anyway, she came home that night happier than I\u2019ve ever seen her, because she\u2019d finally met a real live vampire. Two days later, there was an invite in her work e-mail, a party here at the embassy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first party, yeah. That was maybe two months ago. I\u2019d have to look it up to be sure. I don\u2019t keep track of Lacey\u2019s social calendar, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s partied with your vampire guys at least once a week since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they feeding from her?\u201d</p><p>Emma blanched at the straightforward question. She\u2019d asked herself the same thing a thousand times, but she\u2019d never asked Lacey. She didn\u2019t really want to know.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted to Duncan. \u201cI never saw\u2014\u201d She drew a shaky breath. \u201cI never saw any marks on her neck or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t necessarily. It is likely, however, that your friend was permitting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLacey,\u201d Emma interrupted. \u201cHer name is Lacey.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan acknowledged the correction with a dip of his head. \u201cAs charming as I\u2019m sure Lacey is, I doubt Victor would have continued to invite her unless she was providing blood. It\u2019s not uncommon, you understand.\u201d</p><p>Emma looked at him blankly. \u201cWhat\u2019s not uncommon?\u201d</p><p>Duncan gave her a pitying look. \u201cThere are many humans, Ms. Duquet, who are eager to serve as a blood source for vampires. It can be quite enjoyable for them.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou mean for the humans? How can that be enjoyable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexually,\u201d he drawled, and the word seemed to whisper seductively from his kissable mouth directly to her ear. It was so real she could feel the warmth of his breath teasing her cheek as his voice curled around her senses.</p><p>Emma\u2019s heart beat faster. Sweat popped delicately between her breasts, and moisture of an entirely different sort pooled deep between her thighs. She felt her nipples tightening and was glad for the heavy fabric of her jacket which would keep anyone from noticing. Except the heated look on Duncan\u2019s face said that he knew she was aroused, knew that her nipples were scraping exquisitely against the lace of her bra. She wanted to clench her legs together against the ache, but refused to give him the satisfaction. She clenched her fingers around the chair arms instead.</p><p>This was ridiculous.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, forcing her brain back on track. \u201cLook,deli she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about human and vampire interactions. I don\u2019t even like the movies. All I know is that Lacey partied with you guys, and now she\u2019s missing. She hasn\u2019t come home or even called me in three days. Something\u2019s happened, and I want to know what you\u2019re going to do about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it not possible, Ms. Duquet,\u201d Duncan said patiently, \u201cthat Lacey has met someone she enjoys and is spending an extra few days alone with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d have called me. She knows I\u2019d worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call her office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an inquiring look. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Emma pinched her mouth angrily. Damn him. \u201cAnd she supposedly took the week off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No ah. She didn\u2019t tell me she was taking the week off, and she would have. Something is wrong here, and if I wait too long, I\u2019ll never\u2014\u201d Her voice broke as she fought back tears. Why couldn\u2019t she make anyone understand? Lacey was so much more than a roommate. They were best friends, sisters in every way that counted. They were all each other had in the world, and Lacey would never have done this to her!</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t move except to frown thoughtfully. \u201cI believe you,\u201d he said unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Emma whispered, nearly choking on the sob that was trying to force its way up her throat.</p><p>\u201cMind you,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cI\u2019m not convinced anything dire has occurred, but I do believe you know Lacey quite well, certainly better than I do. And if you say something is off about this situation, then it\u2019s worth looking into.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, biting her lip to keep from blubbering like an idiot.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s gaze sharpened on her mouth, and he stiffened from his relaxed sideways pose, turning smoothly until he once again faced her across the desk. \u201cAs I said earlier, Ms. Duquet, we\u2019ve only just arrived in this city. Last night, as a matter of fact. Victor departed rather unexpectedly, which leaves us to dig through his records on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you call him or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not reachable, but I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p><p>Emma sighed. He was humoring her. He had no intention of trying to find Lacey. He wasn\u2019t even willing to call Victor, much less anything else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not only saying this to appease you,\u201d he insisted, and she frowned. That was the second time he\u2019d seemed to read her thoughts. Was it possible?</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not reading your thoughts either,\u201d he added, smiling. \u201cWhat I have is many years experience reading human expressions, and your face is very expressive.\u201d</p><p>Emma blushed. \u201cUm, thank you. I guess. So, how long\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re anxious, but give me a couple of days. I will get back to you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Emma wanted to protest. Two more days! But it was better than she\u2019d honestly expected before she got here, and it was probably the best she was going to get. She drew a deep, calming breath, in and out.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Thank you,\u201d she said, and reached into her pocket to pull out her cell phone. \u201cI left my purse in the car, so I don\u2019t have any business cards with me, but I can text my numbers to you, or\u2014\u201d She raised her head to meet his very human brown eyes. \u201cDo vampires use cell phones?\u201d</p><p>Duncan grinned. \u201cWe do indeed. All the modern conveniences.\u201d He slipped a hand into his jacket pocket, retrieved his own phone, and rapidly tapped a few keys. Then he slid it across the desk to her.</p><p>\u201cYou can enter your number there.\u201d</p><p>Emma took the phone and glanced down at the screen. Her name had been typed in and was just waiting for a number. Feeling as if she were crossing some invisible line, she entered in her cell and work numbers, then put the phone back on the desk.</p><p>\u201cI have a land line at home, but I never use it. Just the cell,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd my office number. I gave you that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I take your number?\u201d</p><p>Duncan had already pushed away from the desk and stood, as if the interview was over. He stopped and gave her a bemused look. \u201cOf course. Miguel.\u201d</p><p>Emma frowned. He couldn\u2019t tell her his number? He needed Miguel to do it for him? But Miguel was leaning across the desk, holding out a thick, white business card. Emma looked down as she took it. There were two lines on the card. Duncan\u2019s name, which apparently included a last name of Milford, even though he hadn\u2019t introduced himself that way, and a phone number. No title, no identifying affiliation of any kind.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiguel, walk Ms. Duquet out to her car, would you? It\u2019s dark and slippery out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, really, I\u2019m okay,\u201d she protested. The last thing she wanted was a stroll in the dark with the growler, Miguel.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you are,\u201d Duncan said implacably. \u201cMiguel.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stood at an upstairs window and watched as Miguel escorted Emma Duquet out through the gate and down the street to her car, which was an older model Honda, he noted. A reliable car, but not an expensive one.</p><p>She said something to Miguel as she opened the car door. Probably thanking him, but nothing more than that. She wasn\u2019t comfortable with Miguel, or maybe she sensed his distrust of her. Whichever it was, Duncan didn\u2019t mind. If anyone was going to get closer to Ms. Duquet it would be him. He was attracted to her in a way he hadn\u2019t been to any woman in a very long time. He supposed it had something to do with the gentle hint of a drawl in her voice, one she\u2019d clearly worked hard to lose. But it was still there to anyone who\u2019d grown up in the South and knew what to listen for. It was said that a man\u2019s taste in women, and vice versa, was set when he was still a child, long before that taste was ever acted upon. If so, it was entirely possible that, even now, Duncan\u2019s taste in women was a throwback to his youth in Tennessee nearly two hundred years ago. But he suspected it was more than that, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSire?\u201d Louis said behind him. \u201cYou called for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to break the security on Victor\u2019s computers,\u201d Duncan said without turning. \u201cForget the rest for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. I\u2019ll begin at once.\u201d There was an undercurrent of eagerness in Louis\u2019s voice. For all his skill at fighting, Louis was a geek at heart, a technical genius who\u2019d never met a security system he couldn\u2019t break into. He\u2019d been dying to get into Victor\u2019s computers.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Louis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want everything you can find on Emma Duquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything, Louis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Duncan continued to watch as Emma drove her car along the curve of the cul-de-sac, circling around before heading back the way she\u2019d come. He thought of her lovely eyes, such an unusual color, the exact shade of pansies in the spring. He still remembered the flowers from his mother\u2019s garden in that other lifetime. Things had changed so much since then. It was more than a different time; it was a whole different world. He frowned at the thought. He rarely remembered those days anymore, and now Emma\u2019s pretty eyes had brought them to mind twice in one evening.</p><p>She\u2019d been telling the truth about her friend. What she knew of it, anyway. Part of what made Duncan so successful with humans was his vampire-enhanced empathy. It was an unusual talent among his kind. Vampires were far more likely to lose any connection they\u2019d once had to human emotion, rather than to gain it. But even as a human, Duncan had possessed an intuitive feel for other people\u2019s emotions. And somehow, when he\u2019d become a vampire, that intuition had only grown. It had been too much at first, feeling every emotion of the people\u2014human or vampire\u2014around him. Even worse, emotions sometimes lingered in buildings or rooms, especially if the feelings were particularly strong or traumatic, like fear, hate, or even love. His abilities bordered on the psychic, but then many of the abilities bestowed by the Vampire transition did.</p><p>Over time he\u2019d learned to block out the general noise, learned how to tap into feelings selectively. And he\u2019d definitely selected to tap into Ms. Duquet this evening. Her feelings had been very straightforward, and, as frequently was the case, knowledge of her emotions had led to knowledge of her thoughts. The two went hand in hand, after all. People often lied with their mouths, but their thoughts were always truthful. Combined with all of the other clues humans gave off, he could generally judge a human as well as he could one of his own vampire children. And since a vampire Sire knew his children as well as he knew himself, that was saying something.</p><p>But if Emma Duquet was telling the truth, then Victor\u2019s activities went far beyond corruption, beyond even the abominations he\u2019d kept imprisoned in his basement. Which meant Duncan had to find out exactly what Victor\u2019s crimes were before they came crashing down on Duncan\u2019s head.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>The next night, Duncan opened the door from his private suite and stepped into the hallway, wincing as something big plummeted through the open stairwell and hit the first floor with a resounding boom. This was his people\u2019s straightforward method of expeditious junk disposal. Unfortunately, it was creating a rapidly growing pile of debris in the foyer. Eventually, all that junk would have to be hauled out into the yard where it would sit until they had better security in place. There\u2019d be no more uninvited visitors slipping past a heedlessly open gate.</p><p>The rest of the team from California had arrived right on schedule late last night, and the house was much busier than it had been. The newly arrived vampires had all knelt and sworn a blood oath to him, transferring their allegiance from Raphael to Duncan. It was all done with Raphael\u2019s blessing, which made the whole process much simpler. Duncan was their master now; their hearts beat at his command.</p><p>And his current command had much to do with cleaning up the remnants of Victor\u2019s corruption. All three levels of the old house were being searched thoroughly, which in many cases meant being literally torn apart. No one trusted Victor, but they weren\u2019t entirely certain what they were looking for, either. Listening or recording devices, certainly. When those were found, they were removed and traced back to their control base, which thus far had proven to be a windowless room secreted away next to Victor\u2019s daytime resting chamber on the third floor. That in itself was appalling, that he\u2019d chosen to fashion a daytime resting place for himself on the highest floor. But then the basement would have been out of the question, since it had been filled with his half-sentient vampire slaves.</p><p>In any event, many of the recording devices they had found were located in bedrooms, and the video collection in Victor\u2019s hideaway gave proof that those bedrooms had been used frequently, if only for an hour or two at a time. More significantly, most of the men featured in those videos were faces Duncan and everyone else recognized from the evening news.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know yet if Victor had been actively blackmailing anyone\u2014although he\u2019d know even that before they were finished\u2014but, if not, he\u2019d certainly been stockpiling blackmail material against future needs.</p><p>Duncan walked down the hall to where Louis had set up his equipment in an ongoing effort to unravel the various files from Victor\u2019s computers. What he\u2019d found so far was just more evidence of Victor\u2019s rampant paranoia. In the human world, he\u2019d have been living in a small apartment with tin foil over the windows and newspapers piled up to the ceiling. Instead, he\u2019d been a powerful vampire lord, hundreds of years old and nesting in the D.C. area before the city had even had a name. Duncan didn\u2019t know what Victor had done before they\u2019d established the U.S. Capital here. Maybe haunted the battlefields of the revolution, preying on dying soldiers.</p><p>Or maybe,Duncan thought to himself, I\u2019m a tad bit prejudiced against the old vampire. He smiled ruefully, then sighed. They didn\u2019t need him here. He supposed he could start ripping out walls with the rest of them, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d</p> <p>Louis\u2019s excited shout had Duncan crossing quickly to the desk where his security chief was bent over the keyboard of Victor\u2019s main computer. Two other vampire geeks crowded close and began making suggestions as Louis keyed through the data. Duncan stepped out of their way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve broken the main encryption, my lord,\u201d Louis explained tersely as he continued to type. \u201cBut there are additional codes within some of these files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s a simple alpha designation,\u201d one of the others commented quietly. \u201cTry opening\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, there it is. Pictures and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Duncan demanded. The others slid out of his way as he moved to stand behind Louis once again.</p><p>\u201cWomen, my lord,\u201d Louis explained, paging through a file.</p><p>\u201cYoung, beautiful, human women,\u201d another added appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cNo names,\u201d Louis put in. \u201cInitials only, but with the pictures, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult . . . Did the woman the other night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma Duquet,\u201d Duncan provided.</p><p>\u201cRight. Did she leave a picture of her missing friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, one minute.\u201d Louis swiveled his chair around to the desk behind him and pulled his laptop closer. \u201cI started digging into Duquet\u2019s background like you asked,\u201d he said as he typed. \u201cHer full name\u2019s Emmaline Marie Duquet, by the way, though she rarely uses it. She has a Facebook page she hasn\u2019t updated regularly in years, but let me check . . . Yep. There it is. Her friend\u2019s first name was Lacey, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Duncan said. He was watching over Louis\u2019s shoulder, seeing pictures of a younger, less sophisticated Emma Duquet flash by, pictures clearly taken either before or right after she arrived in Washington. Or maybe it was worry for her friend that had taken away the sparkle in her eyes, the grin that said she was going to take on the world and win.</p><p>\u201cLacey Cray,\u201d Louis muttered, settling on a single picture of Emma with her arm around a lovely blonde about her own age. \u201cPretty name. Pretty girl, too. Too bad.\u201d</p><p>Duncan wanted to dispute the finality of Louis\u2019s last words with their assumption that Lacey was already dead, but he couldn\u2019t. Despite his reassurances to Emma last night, and as much as he\u2019d like to produce Lacey safe and sound for her, he knew that wasn\u2019t the most likely outcome.</p><p>Louis turned back to Victor\u2019s computer. \u201cThere are dates next to each woman\u2019s picture, my lord. And different initials after each date. I\u2019m thinking . . .\u201d He stopped typing and looked up at Duncan, as if to judge his reaction. \u201cGiven what we\u2019ve already seen of Victor\u2019s personal porno collection, this is most likely a record of sexual encounters, my lord. The second set of initials are the men these women were paired off with, complete with dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a fucking pimp,\u201d one of the vampires whispered in disgust. \u201cHell, maybe that\u2019s where his money came from. So far we\u2019ve got him living like a Rockefeller, but no income.\u201d</p><p>Duncan glanced up. \u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe owned a lot of property, my lord,\u201d the vamp said. \u201cBut too much of it is in rundown neighborhoods, stuff he bought decades ago and forgot to sell before the market tanked. As far as I can find, he didn\u2019t even bother to collect rent on some of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about better properties, places he might be using himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few of those, sure. I can get you a list\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that now, and e-mail the information to Louis and Miguel. And keep looking. If he didn\u2019t make money legitimately, where did it come from? It has to be there somewhere. Either that, or he didn\u2019t keep those records on any of the computers we\u2019ve found so far, in which case\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grimaced as someone upstairs began laying into a plaster wall with what sounded like a sledge hammer. He let out a long, noisy breath and said, \u201cIf the records are in this house, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find them very soon. But in the meantime, Louis . . .\u201d He met his security chief\u2019s pale gaze. \u201c. . . did Victor maintain any blood houses?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Louis shook his head. \u201cNot in the city of D.C., my lord. He and his four were the only vamps he permitted to live here . . . well, other than those creatures in the basement. But there are plenty of blood houses in the surrounding states. Not always houses, of course, sometimes clubs, like what Rajmund has up in Manhattan. About half as ritzy, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a list of anyplace within . . .\u201d Duncan thought for a moment. \u201cLet\u2019s make it within two hours\u2019 drive from here. I suspect Victor\u2019s less savory entertaining was done somewhere other than this house. Not that he would have cared, but his guests might have. And Emma said Lacey talked about going to a party outside the city. How long will it take you to come up with that information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than a few minutes, my lord. Victor kept lousy records, but I started building my own database a few weeks ago, pretty much as soon as I arrived here to start getting things ready for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019m going to track down Miguel,\u201d Duncan said, \u201cand you can meet us in the library once you have the list. The rest of you keep working on these files, and if you find anything noteworthy, call my cell.\u201d</p><p>Duncan found Miguel in the basement with yet another of the vampire crews that had come in last night. This one was very specialized and would only remain until their task was complete, which, from the looks of things, would be much longer than anyone anticipated.</p><p>\u201cThis is all shit, Miguel,\u201d a wiry, gray-haired vampire was saying. He slapped a beam of rotting wood and Duncan winced, hoping the entire house wasn\u2019t about to collapse on their heads. They\u2019d probably survive, but it might take a while to dig themselves out.</p><p>Duncan grinned at the gray-haired vamp\u2019s back and said, \u201cThink of it as a challenge, Alaric.\u201d</p><p>The vampire spun around with a bark of laughter. \u201cA challenge is you trying to last the full five minutes in the ring with me, my lord. This . . .\u201d He waved at the musty, dark basement around them. \u201c. . . this is plain old shit. And I\u2019m not even talking about the vamp dust left over from Victor\u2019s abomination experiment.\u201d</p> <p>All laughter fled, and Duncan nodded soberly. \u201cLouis cleaned most of it out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he did a fine job of it, too,\u201d Alaric agreed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you, Duncan. I served in more than one war as a human and saw some pretty awful things. And God knows, I\u2019ve seen my share of horrific sights as a vampire. But this? This place gives me the creeps. I wouldn\u2019t want to sleep down here, even if the foundation wasn\u2019t rotting and about to dump the whole house on my head.\u201d</p><p>Duncan regarded the other vampire thoughtfully. Alaric was the finest vampire contractor in North America. He\u2019d built the daytime sleep vaults in every one of Raphael\u2019s personal residences and scattered headquarters, including the new compound up near Seattle. There were a couple of other crews doing similar work in the vampire community. They\u2019d all trained with Alaric, and that let them charge a very pretty price for their services. But there was no substitute for having Alaric himself in charge of your project, and Duncan would have paid any price Alaric asked in order to secure the safest possible resting place for his people. A vampire was completely helpless during daytime sleep. The recent murders of two of Raphael\u2019s vampires, along with three more in Canada, had proved that beyond a doubt.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you propose?\u201d he asked now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time and a lot of money to put in a decent underground vault,\u201d Alaric warned him immediately. \u201cThis whole city\u2019s built on a fucking swamp.\u201d</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t miss the gleam in Alaric\u2019s eye when he said that, although it was probably as much from the challenge as the price tag.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it costs. If it can be done, I want it done.\u201d</p><p>The vamp shook his head, laughing softly. \u201cI\u2019ll give you this, my lord. You do things right. Okay. Let me get the rest of my guys in here, and we\u2019ll do a full inspection.\u201d He gave Miguel a pointed look. \u201cI won\u2019t be needing you for that part.\u201d</p><p>Miguel looked affronted, but Duncan intervened quickly and said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. I need Miguel with me tonight anyway.\u201d</p><p>His lieutenant gave him an inquiring look, but Duncan just signaled him to follow. Vampire hearing was entirely too good, and as much as he admired Alaric\u2019s skill, he had no desire to share the details of his personal affairs.</p><p>Miguel immediately took the lead, going upstairs ahead of Duncan, pausing to scan the hallway before stepping through the doorway. As if enemies were already lying in wait for them somewhere between the kitchen and the stairs. But Duncan didn\u2019t say anything. The situation was still too unsettled. Security was better, but not yet up to Miguel\u2019s\u2014or Duncan\u2019s\u2014standards. There were vampires working all over the house, and yet it was still more than half empty. Eventually it would feel like home and safety. But not yet.</p><p>Louis was already waiting for them in the library. \u201cI e-mailed the data to both of you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat data?\u201d Miguel asked, pulling out his smartphone.</p><p>\u201cVictor was giving parties with guests who\u2019d rather not be seen,\u201d Duncan replied. \u201cWhich means he was using a house that\u2019s at least private, if not isolated. He wouldn\u2019t have wanted neighbors seeing people come and go all the time; they might get nosey and see someone they recognize. But he wouldn\u2019t have been using some rundown cabin in the woods, either. Victor was a snob. The house will be elegant, expensive, very possibly in an exclusive area of homes, but with substantial acreage for privacy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeesburg, Virginia, my lord,\u201d Louis said confidently. \u201cVictor owned two properties there, both of which would suit, and there\u2019s a blood house nearby, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far?\u201dDuncan asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout thirty-five miles. This time of night, thirty minutes to an hour, depending on traffic.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. It might be late winter, but the nights were still long. They\u2019d have plenty of time. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then. Unless you\u2019d rather stay here and knock down some walls for Alaric.\u201d He started for the door, then glanced down at what he was wearing. Like the others, he was dressed casually, in jeans and a sweater. He hadn\u2019t planned on meeting any of his new subjects tonight, hadn\u2019t planned on even leaving the house, much less visiting any of the blood houses. But it would take time for him to change, and besides these clothes were warmer. That decided it for Duncan. He grabbed a leather jacket from the old-fashioned coat tree near the door, pulling it on over his sweater. There was a leather hair tie in the jacket pocket, so he finger-combed his hair back and tied it into a rough tail. It would have to do. Raj\u2019s Manhattan club might be tuxedo territory, but most blood houses were far less formal. And if not, well, he was their lord and master, and he\u2019d wear whatever he damned well pleased. And if anyone had a problem with it, he wouldn\u2019t mind a good bloodletting either.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The blood house didn\u2019t exactly look like a hot bed of vampire activity. Located in a tony housing tract in an upscale suburb of Leesburg, it was a meticulously maintained contemporary home with a low-slung profile and pristine landscaping. The houses in this area were spaced far apart and surrounded by a broad swath of green forest, which gave the illusion of living amongst nature. The effect was lovely, and very private.</p><p>It was two a.m., or vampire high noon, but there were no cars in the driveway or in front of the house. Duncan could detect two vampires inside, however, both wide awake.</p><p>\u201cKind of quiet for a blood house, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Louis asked, eyeing the house doubtfully.</p><p>Duncan nodded, agreeing with Louis. Something wasn\u2019t quite right here. \u201cWell, someone\u2019s home. Let\u2019s be polite and ring the doorbell.\u201d</p><p>The door opened while they were still making their way down the paved walk to the flat front porch. Miguel and Louis both tensed and immediately formed a wall in front of Duncan.</p><p>By contrast, the slender, dark-haired vampire standing in the doorway gave them a big smile and bowed gracefully. \u201cWelcome, my lord,\u201d he said, trying discreetly to catch a glimpse of Duncan behind the wall of vampire. \u201cPlease,\u201d he added, straightening to give a welcoming gesture, \u201ccome inside and get warm.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Brendan,\u201d Duncan murmured, stepping around his two bodyguards.</p><p>Since they\u2019d never met, Brendan twitched at the sound of his name, but Duncan knew he was Brendan Folmer. He\u2019d taken the knowledge from the vampire\u2019s brain before he\u2019d ever opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI am Duncan,\u201d he said, entering the house. He indicated the others. \u201cMy lieutenant, Miguel, and security chief, Louis.\u201d</p><p>Brendan closed the door behind them. \u201cErik will be down in a moment, my lord,\u201d he said, referring to the second vampire in the house, the one Duncan could sense upstairs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brendan\u2019s worried explanation was cut off as the second vampire appeared on the landing. He raced downstairs and immediately knelt in front of Duncan. \u201cMy lord Duncan,\u201d he said reverently. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>With a look of dismay, Brendan dropped gracefully to his knees next to his partner and lowered his gaze.</p><p>Duncan brushed a hand over their bowed heads, acknowledging their submission. \u201cI\u2019m gratified by your welcome,\u201d he said.</p><p>Erik jumped to his feet as soon as Duncan\u2019s hand lifted. \u201cYou\u2019ll find no sorrow for Victor\u2019s passing here, my lord. Nor anywhere in the territory, I would imagine.\u201d He gestured at a matching pair of pale leather couches in front of the fireplace. \u201cWould you like to sit? The fire is nice, especially on these cold nights.\u201d</p><p>Brendan laughed. \u201cErik thinks anything below seventy degrees Fahrenheit is freezing.\u201d</p><p>Duncan privately agreed with that assessment. Washington winters were going to take some getting used to after so many years in L. A.\u2019s balmy climate.</p><p>\u201cSo this is your home, then?\u201d he asked, settling onto the couch and stifling a sigh of pleasure at the fire\u2019s heat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Erik sat opposite Duncan and crossed his legs, propping an ankle on the opposite knee. \u201cBren and I bought this house several years ago from a vampire named Scovill. An older vamp. What would you say, Bren, two, three hundred years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, much older than that,\u201d Brendan said. \u201cAnd not too pleased with how Victor ran things, either. He bought a house way back in the Blue Ridge mountains, I think.\u201d He shuddered discreetly. \u201cVery unpleasant vampire, but powerful too. The locals probably think Big Foot has finally come home to roost.\u201d</p><p>Miguel had been prowling the downstairs, but now took up a position behind Duncan and said, \u201cVictor had this place marked as a blood house. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d Erik said dismissively. \u201cWe have a small group of vampires who come together every weekend, my lord,\u201d Eric said, addressing Duncan. \u201cPrivate affairs, very discreet. There is a blood house in this area, however. On the other side of Leesburg. Victor probably did own that one. And there\u2019s a second property, more in the way of an estate\u2014big house, lots of property. I imagine it\u2019s all yours now, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded and signaled to Miguel. \u201cI want to verify the addresses we have.\u201d</p><p>Erik pulled out his PDA and began conferring with Miguel. But Brendan gave Duncan a somber look. \u201cWhat you really want to know about are Victor\u2019s parties, I imagine.\u201d He paused, waiting for a response. When Duncan simply looked at him, he hurried on. \u201cThat\u2019s what the estate was for. He used to come out here regularly with a bunch of big wigs. Senators, congressmen, even the occasional cabinet member, and a whole bunch of lobbyists. That was the real purpose of the parties. The lobbyists got unfettered access to policymakers away from the glare of the Washington press, and Victor got paid very, very well for making it possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did the policymakers get out of it?\u201d Duncan asked quietly.</p><p>Brendan looked away in obvious discomfort, glancing over at Erik and back again, clearly reluctant to continue.</p> <p>Erik murmured something to Miguel, then nodded and dropped his PDA onto the side table. \u201cGo ahead, Bren,\u201d he sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone this far, so you might as well tell the whole sordid story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe policymakers got different things,\u201d Brendan said evasively. \u201cSome of our fine elected leaders got kickbacks in the form of soft money campaign donations. Others . . .\u201d He tightened his lips in distaste. \u201cSex, I think.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned. Sex? That was the big secret? Men in power being offered sex in exchange for favors? That was so common it was almost trivial. There had to be something more to it, something the neatly pressed Brendan didn\u2019t want to talk about.</p><p>\u201cNot just sex,\u201d Erik explained, with a sympathetic look in Brendan\u2019s direction. \u201cVictor seduced women for these men, often very young women, and all of them very beautiful. He got them to do things that I\u2019m quite certain most of them never would have done otherwise. Hell, he got them to do men they probably wouldn\u2019t have done either. I know power\u2019s an aphrodisiac and all that, but even that can only carry so far with most people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Victor was getting paid for these parties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean were the lobbyists paying him directly?\u201d Erik clarified. \u201cYes, I think so. More than one of them joked about it. Victor insisted some of us attend his sordid little affairs, even though we refused to whore for him. We were all professionals of one sort or another, and Victor thought his clients would respect him more if they saw the kind of vampires he controlled, if they saw how powerful he was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs if,\u201d Brendan muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes, well. He thought so, anyway,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd then there were the other parties, the special ones.\u201d</p><p>Duncan felt Miguel\u2019s attention sharpen behind him.</p><p>\u201cBooze flowed freely at Victor\u2019s parties and his guests liked to talk. One of the things they loved to talk about was the special parties. That\u2019s what they always called them, \u2018the special.\u2019 Like, they\u2019d point out a particular woman and say, \u2018Hope that one\u2019s at the next special.\u2019 Victor didn\u2019t have that kind of party often, maybe a couple times a year, but they were hard-core. If you can believe what the men bragged about\u2014and I do\u2014the women were flat out raped, and by more than one man. Some of them were even hurt pretty badly. The man who told me all this laughed when he talked about how Victor would heal the women afterward so they\u2019d be ready to go again the next night. It made me sick, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Victor or his henchmen have a website where you can download a video of his \u2018specials\u2019 for a price.\u201d</p><p>Miguel leaned forward. \u201cSurely the men involved wouldn\u2019t want their identities revealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they film from the back,\u201d Brendan said, with a shrug. \u201cThe viewer gets a shot of a senator\u2019s pasty white ass while he whips some poor girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you report this?\u201d Duncan asked.</p><p>\u201cTo whom, my lord?\u201d Erik asked mildly. \u201cVictor was our lord. By rights, he was the one to whom we\u2019d have reported such an abuse. And every vampire lord in the country would be after our heads if we went to the human police. We\u2019d never live long enough to testify.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan was forced to agree. Even if Erik or Brendan had complained to another vampire lord, Victor would have been told, and the two vampires would have been executed without anyone raising a word of protest.</p><p>And even now, hearing about it for the first time, Duncan didn\u2019t know what to say that wouldn\u2019t sound like a meaningless platitude. All they had was his word that he was different from Victor, that such things would never happen under his rule. Duncan stood, turning to face Erik and Brendan, who had jumped to their feet.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever need anything,\u201d Duncan said, \u201cyou may call me. If I\u2019m not available, you may speak to either Miguel or Louis. They\u2019ll fill me in, and I will get back to you. I\u2019m not Victor, gentlemen. You will see that in time.\u201d</p><p>He stepped around the couch, signaling Louis who was waiting by the front door.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the information, and for your hospitality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Brendan said when Duncan was halfway to the door.</p><p>Duncan turned and gave him a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord. We knew you were different from the moment you claimed the territory. You cared more in those few minutes of terror and confusion than Victor had in his entire rule. Just by getting rid of him, you\u2019ve done every vampire in this territory a service already. We\u2019ll talk to the others, too, and let them know.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll see each other again, Brendan. I don\u2019t intend to be a stranger to my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking Victor,\u201d Duncan swore as Louis steered the big SUV down the curving driveway. \u201cI can\u2019t believe none of us realized how corrupt he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you, my lord? He never let anyone but his guards live in the District, and anyone else who may have known was too frightened to take action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no excuse. I saw him every damn year at the Council meetings, and I never suspected any of this. Neither did Raphael, and it\u2019s not easy to pull one over on him.\u201d</p><p>Miguel shrugged. \u201cNot if he\u2019s looking for it, but why would he have looked for any of this? I\u2019ve never been to a Council meeting, but I know they don\u2019t last long. A few hours, maybe? It\u2019s not like they meet for cocktails and dinner afterwards. And when they\u2019re together, I imagine everyone has their shields locked up as tight as a virgin\u2019s knickers.\u201d</p><p>Duncan gave his lieutenant a sideways look. \u201cYou\u2019re not old enough to know about virgins or knickers, Miguel,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cHey, we still have virgins!\u201d Miguel protested with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Duncan agreed. He was grateful for the change of mood. \u201cYou checked the addresses with Erik?\u201d</p><p>Miguel nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the same two we have, though we didn\u2019t have a record of the one property operating as a blood house. From what Erik said it\u2019s pretty active, too. It\u2019s the only one for a hundred miles around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think this whole trip was a waste of time, but we might as well check it out next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to leave enough time to get back to the city tonight, my lord,\u201d Miguel commented. \u201cAnd that blood house is a good hour\u2019s drive on the other side of Leesburg. I don\u2019t want you to end up spending a day unguarded in a strange blood house, or worse, that party place of Victor\u2019s. God knows what sort of people he let in there. We should head back tonight and get an early start tomorrow. Check them both out then.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned. The whole idea of Victor\u2019s parties made him want to kill the vampire lord all over again, but it also sounded a lot like what Lacey had described to Emma, and that couldn\u2019t be good. He wanted to see the house for himself, but Miguel had a point.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do them both tomorrow. The blood house and Victor\u2019s party place, though I expect there\u2019s nothing left there but the ghosts of pain and old blood.\u201d</p><p>The next night, as Duncan stood in the yard of Victor\u2019s Leesburg estate, he looked back and remembered those words. He remembered and thought how foolish he\u2019d been to believe he\u2019d already understood the full depth of Victor\u2019s depravity.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Emma found it nearly impossible to concentrate. Two days had passed since she\u2019d spoken to Duncan at the vampire embassy, and she\u2019d heard nothing back from him yet. She was so strung out with nerves that she\u2019d skipped her morning coffee, figuring she didn\u2019t need the caffeine, even though she\u2019d barely slept last night. But then she hadn\u2019t really slept since the first night Lacey had gone missing. And no matter what anyone else thought, Emma had never doubted Lacey was missing. They\u2019d known each other since they were eleven years old, that horrible year when Emma\u2019s mother had died from the same cancer that had taken her Grandmama years before. Overnight, she\u2019d found herself orphaned with no other family on her mother\u2019s side to take her in. She\u2019d never known anyone from her father\u2019s family; didn\u2019t even know if there was anyone. So Emma had been left all alone in the world, shuffled into foster care along with the thousands of others just like her. And she would have stayed all alone, too, if not for Lacey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time Emma arrived, Lacey had already been living with their foster parents for three years. Lacey\u2019s birth parents had been more interested in their drugs than their only child, bouncing in and out of jail until finally a half-starved and terrified Lacey had been taken away from them for good. But you\u2019d never have known it from meeting Lacey. She was as sunny as her hair was blond, a cheerful little girl who\u2019d taken the lonely Emma in hand and announced they were sisters. Just like that. As if deciding it somehow made it so.</p><p>But for Lacey it did, and eventually for Emma, too. They\u2019d been inseparable ever since, sharing horrible apartments through college, squeezing the system for every penny of financial aid they could get, and working two and three jobs to make up for the rest. After college, Lacey had gone right to work, while Emma went to law school. And then had come their big decision to move to Washington, the center of power, the place where their fortunes would be made\u2014or married into, in Lacey\u2019s case.</p><p>And now, as Emma sat at her desk, staring sightlessly at the computer screen in front of her, she wondered if Lacey would still be missing if Emma hadn\u2019t insisted they move here.</p> <p>\u201cEmma!\u201d</p><p>She hid her grimace at the sound of her boss\u2019s voice\u2014or rather her boss\u2019s wife\u2019s voice, which was the same thing.</p><p>\u201cSharon?\u201d Emma said, looking up and over her monitor.</p><p>Sharon Coffer frowned down at her, every strand of her carefully tinted and styled hair in perfect alignment, her face almost immovable beneath a layer of makeup so thick that just looking at it made Emma\u2019s skin gasp for oxygen. What was it with so many of these political women that they felt the need to roll on the makeup? And she didn\u2019t even want to get started on that helmet of a hairdo.</p><p>\u201cHave you finished the draft of that constituent letter yet?\u201d Sharon demanded, which was pretty standard for Sharon. She never asked; she demanded.</p> <p>Emma nodded. \u201cI just finished. You want me to print it out?\u201d</p><p>Sharon\u2019s scowl deepened further as she clearly tried to decide if Emma was mocking her or not. God forbid the woman have to read a damn one page letter on her computer monitor. That would mean she\u2019d have to wear her glasses instead of hiding them in her purse like some sort of shameful deformity.</p><p>\u201cDo that,\u201d Sharon said at last, then spun on her heel and stomped off to torment some other unfortunate.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she likes you,\u201d Noreen whispered from the desk right next to Emma\u2019s. Noreen was Congressman Coffer\u2019s personal secretary, not that Sharon ever permitted her to meet with the congressman alone. Sharon didn\u2019t trust any female when it came to her husband. The all-American good looks and charm that had helped Guy Coffer get elected also made him far too attractive for Sharon\u2019s peace of mind. But Emma had never heard even a whisper of gossip about the congressman and another woman. And if there\u2019d been something, she would have heard about it. The grapevine in these hallowed halls made the old ladies back home look like total amateurs in the gossip department.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like anything with a vagina,\u201d Emma murmured back to Noreen, and was rewarded by the sound of choking laughter.</p><p>Not that Emma gave a damn about Sharon or her handsome husband. Except that Sharon\u2019s insane jealousy was a major roadblock to advancement in the Congressman\u2019s office for anyone female and under sixty, and Emma had aspirations for her career that went well beyond dealing with constituent complaints. She had a law degree, dammit, and sometimes she doubted her decision in coming here at all, which brought her thoughts right back to Lacey.</p> <p>\u201cEm, there\u2019s a birthday party next door and I need cake. You want some?\u201d</p><p>Emma looked up at Noreen and gave her a blank stare.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Emma, you want cake? I bet it\u2019s cho-co-late.\u201d Noreen dragged the last word out tantalizingly, but Emma shook her head, glancing down at her watch. She couldn\u2019t do this. Couldn\u2019t sit here like everything was business as usual while she waited for the vampires to decide if something had happened to Lacey.</p><p>\u201cI have to leave early today.\u201d</p><p>Noreen goggled at her. No one left early, not from this office, and pretty much not from anywhere on the Hill when Congress was in session.</p><p>Emma felt her face flushing, but she ignored her friend\u2019s disbelief to open her desk drawer and drag out the enormous bag she called a purse. She\u2019d tried a million times to go with something smaller, but each time she invariably ended up back with the big one. She was closing the drawer when the staccato sound of high heels announced Sharon Coffer\u2019s return.</p><p>\u201cEmma, the Congressman wants you in on this meeting.\u201d</p><p>Emma turned in disbelief. She was never invited into meetings, especially not meetings like this one. They were reviewing the Congressman\u2019s domestic priorities for the rest of the session, which meant every important piece of legislation likely to come up before the summer recess would be discussed and analyzed. It was everything she lusted after.</p> <p>But why did it have to happen today?</p><p>\u201cEmma, let\u2019s go!\u201d Sharon\u2019s voice was sharp with impatience as she turned and headed back toward the Congressman\u2019s inner office.</p><p>Emma shoved her purse back into the drawer, grabbed a bottle of water, tucked her laptop under her arm and rushed to follow.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Emma closed her car door and staggered up to the house she shared with Lacey, thankful she\u2019d managed to snag a parking space right out front. A sudden gust of wet air blew down the street, chasing the remnants of a newspaper someone had dropped or tossed aside. Its pages littered the gutters, rattling as they rushed ahead of the icy wind. She climbed the stairs, her fingers nearly numb as she inserted her key into the lock. The door opened to a cold, dark house, and Emma stood there for a moment, feeling lost.</p><p>She was lucky to be home before midnight. The way the meeting had dragged into the evening, she\u2019d expected Sharon to order in some cots so they could have a sleepover. And Emma knew she shouldn\u2019t complain, even if the meeting had gone into the wee hours. Today was the first time she\u2019d felt like she was actually doing the job she\u2019d been promised when she came to work for Guy Coffer. And yet, it didn\u2019t feel like any kind of victory. There was no adrenaline rush and none of the excitement she would have expected. Somehow, with no Lacey to help her celebrate, it all felt empty.</p><p>She sighed and kicked the door closed, then dropped her keys into the ugly dish on the small table near the door. Walking across to the light switch on the living room wall, she thought again how stupid it was to walk through a dark room every night when she came home. She should get a small lamp for the table. Of course, she\u2019d been telling herself that same thing for two years now. And usually, Lacey got home before dark, at least on weeknights, so most of the time it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>But what if Lacey never came home again?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cShe will come home, and she\u2019ll be full of great stories about the hot, vampire lover who swept her away for\u2014\u201d A whole week, Emma?</p><p>Her throat closed up with fear, and she wanted to sit right down on the stairs and bawl her eyes out. But she refused to give into the urge. She was just so damn tired it was hard to think straight. The long hours at work, coupled with sleepless nights, were beginning to take a toll, and today had been the longest day of all.</p><p>Bracing a hand on the newel post, she lifted her feet one at a time and took her heels off, then walked up the stairs in her stockinged feet, shoes in hand. One thing about sitting in meetings all day, her feet didn\u2019t hurt nearly as much as they did when she spent the day running all over the Capitol building like an overpaid messenger. On the other hand, her ass hurt and her lower back was killing her.</p><p>By the time she reached her bedroom on the second floor\u2014hers was the one with the big bay window sticking out over the small front yard like a turret on the old Victorian house\u2014her blouse was unbuttoned and she was already yearning for the hot bath she\u2019d promised herself all the way home.</p><p>She glanced down at the street before twisting the rod on the cheap blinds over the window and shutting out the night. The house she and Lacey had rented wasn\u2019t in the best neighborhood in Washington, but not the worst either. And it had been completely renovated before they moved in, including the bathrooms. Lacey had insisted Emma take the bigger bedroom, with the big window and the attached bath, because she paid the bigger share of the rent. In the months where she wasn\u2019t paying the whole thing, that is.</p><p>Dropping her shoes in the closet as she walked by it, she went directly to the tub and turned on the water, letting it run. It sometimes took a few minutes for the hot water to make its way up to the second floor.</p><p>She had pulled off the rest of her clothes, throwing the whole bunch into the laundry basket, and pulled on a warm robe, when she decided the long day warranted a glass of wine to go with the bath. Nothing was more relaxing than a good hot soak with a glass of . . . hmmm, white or red? She\u2019d see what was open.</p><p>Thinking of the cold hardwood floors, she shoved her feet into a pair of UGGs, turned off the water and hurried down the stairs, not permitting herself even a glance at Lacey\u2019s empty room at the other end of the hall. A part of her still expected to come home and find Lacey wiped out and hung over, full of stories and apologies about her unexpected getaway in the arms of some rich guy she\u2019d met. But too often these last few days, when Emma wasn\u2019t being run ragged by her job, her thoughts had turned to far darker imaginings, and she\u2019d wonder if she\u2019d ever see Lacey again.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Emma,\u201d she scolded again as she rounded the bottom of the stairs and headed for the kitchen. The wine would help that, too. Help dull the worry and shut down her brain for a few hours.</p><p>She was reaching for the kitchen light switch when a heavy car door slammed out front. Two more doors slammed hard after the first, and a deep, male voice said something she couldn\u2019t make out. She told herself it was one of her neighbors. Few of the houses here had garages, and most of the residents parked on the street, just as Emma had tonight. But something about the noise made her curious. She tiptoed\u2014and why was she sneaking around her own house?\u2014over to the window near the door and lifted the thin, fabric shade away from the edge so she could look onto the street. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gasped, then immediately covered her mouth against the sound. Vamps supposedly had super hearing, and that was Duncan out there! Even worse, that Miguel guy was with him.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she mouthed silently and backed away from the door. Were they coming here? Well, of course they were. Where else would they be going? She\u2019d backed nearly to the kitchen when the doorbell rang, and she froze. Should she answer it? Maybe if she was very quiet, they\u2019d think she wasn\u2019t home and leave.</p><p>But what if he has news about Lacey?she thought frantically, her tired brain finally clicking back into some semblance of reason. That had to be it. Why else would they be here?</p> <p>She started toward the door, then glanced down at herself and froze once again. She was wearing a bathrobe! A purple, fuzzy bathrobe. And no underwear. Ah, hell, no bra, and Emma did not have the kind of bustline that could go braless without being obvious about it.</p><p>She blew out an exasperated breath.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Duncan\u2019s cool-water voice called her name, tinged with a little bit of worry.</p><p>He was worried? About her? That was nice, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Yeah, but, Emma, you aren\u2019t wearing any panties!</p> <p>Right, right.Underwear first, then handsome vampires.</p><p>\u201cEmma, I know you\u2019re there. Open the door.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was here? How\u2019d he know that?</p><p>\u201cUm, just a minute,\u201d she called out. She raced past the door, slowing long enough to flip the locks and yank the door open as she went by. \u201cY\u2019all come on in. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Before she\u2019d gone halfway up the stairs, her house was full of vampires and one of them was standing in front of her, blocking her way. Her eyes widened in shock and her heart kicked in her chest. He\u2019d moved so fast, and she hadn\u2019t sensed a thing, nothing more than a faint breeze passing her on the stairs. Her startled gaze took in his features in the dim light, and she frowned. It was Miguel. The growler. She backed down a step away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, Ms. Duquet?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Miguel,\u201d Duncan said from somewhere behind her.</p><p>Miguel didn\u2019t move, and Emma\u2019s frown deepened. She refused to hold her robe closed like some sort of maiden aunt, so she stuffed her hands in her pockets and turned to face Duncan. The door was partly open, and she shivered in the cold air.</p><p>\u201cI was going to put some clothes on,\u201d she explained slowly, as if they were too dense to understand such a simple concept.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s gaze made a leisurely journey from her UGG-covered feet to the fuzzy bathrobe, hesitated a breath too long over her braless chest, and continued to what she knew was her pissed-off expression. But instead of showing even a hint of remorse, the bastard smiled. As if he found the entire situation amusing. Again. Emma was getting very tired of being the source of his entertainment.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, but Duncan\u2019s smile only grew wider.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Miguel,\u201d he said again. \u201cLet her by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you very much,\u201d she said, letting the saccharine sweetness of her Southern upbringing flavor the words.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes widened in appreciation, and Emma felt like snarling. That wasn\u2019t the reaction she\u2019d been going for.</p> <p>Determined to retain the little dignity she had left, she started up the stairs again. The growler got out of her way, but he only moved closer to the wall, so she had to squeeze past his bulk. Why were these vampires all so big, anyway? Drinking nothing but blood, you\u2019d think they\u2019d be skin and bones, pale and starved looking. Not these guys. Every one of them\u2014and there were more than just Duncan and Miguel in her house, though she hadn\u2019t bothered to count\u2014was awfully healthy looking. Maybe they dined on bloody steak every night? She frowned, thinking about where that steak might come from. What sort of animal.</p><p>Don\u2019t be ridiculous, Emma. She reined in her vivid imagination, stormed into her bedroom, closed the door with exquisite care, and began pulling on clothes.</p><p>Duncan watched Emma Duquet\u2019s shapely bottom sway beneath the ridiculous purple bathrobe as she hurried up the stairs, edging past Miguel as if she feared he\u2019d leap upon her at any moment. She disappeared into a room on the second floor without so much as a glance backwards, shutting the door with a firm click. Her footsteps clunked overhead in the ungainly boots before a pair of solid thumps told him the boots had been kicked off. He imagined the robe falling away next. She\u2019d been naked under that robe. That much had been obvious, to him at least. Miguel had seemed to fear she was rushing upstairs to arm herself, but Duncan knew she\u2019d simply wanted to get dressed. Too bad. He\u2019d rather liked her the way she was.</p><p>Duncan strolled farther into the house, grateful when Louis finally closed the door, shutting out the cold air. He\u2019d have to invest in a few heavy winter coats if this went on much longer. When did spring come to these parts anyway? It had been too long since he\u2019d lived anywhere with a real winter. He couldn\u2019t remember exactly how long they lasted this far south along the Eastern seaboard. Not that Washington, D.C. was considered part of the South anymore. It was south of the Mason-Dixon line, but there were too many Yankees living here today.</p><p>He smiled, remembering the long, hot summers of the true South. His youth had been spent toiling the fields beneath the burning Tennessee sun. There\u2019d been no long, lazy school vacations for him. No school, for that matter.</p><p>A door opened upstairs, and Duncan backed up several feet until he could see Emma emerge onto the landing above him.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Emma,\u201d he said, trying to pretend he hadn\u2019t seen her wearing that fluffy purple monstrosity of a robe.</p><p>She narrowed those violet eyes at him, as if judging his sincerity, and apparently decided he passed muster. \u201cGood evening, Duncan,\u201d she said finally. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to have this entire conversation with you standing up there?\u201d</p><p>She blew out a flustered breath. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>She descended the stairs quickly, wearing the same clunky boots, but with a pair of jeans, a hooded sweatshirt, and, regrettably, a bra, as well. Although, he contemplated, perhaps it was a pretty bra, something lacy and feminine. He liked pretty bras. He liked taking them off pretty women . . . like Emma.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d Emma asked politely. She switched on a pair of floor lamps, one at either end of an old overstuffed couch. A battered coffee table sat in front of the couch, both pieces looking as if their better days were long behind them.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. We can\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>Emma stopped halfway to the kitchen. She turned to study him nervously, her hands twisting the ties of her sweatshirt. \u201cDid you . . . find something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing specific about Lacey yet, although we are making headway in retracing Victor\u2019s activities. He hosted a lot of parties, many of them in homes he owned out of town. It seems likely Lacey attended one of those parties, given what she told you. Unfortunately, it\u2019s unlikely the other attendees will volunteer any useful information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about people from the Hill,\u201d she said somewhat bitterly.</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cAnd probably some others. The usual Washington assortment. You said Lacey worked for a lobbying firm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, accepting her correction. There was always a possibility, however slim, that Emma\u2019s friend Lacey was still alive. He understood her need to hold on to whatever hope there was.</p><p>\u201cThere must have been other women at the parties,\u201d Emma said. \u201cThey might be willing to talk to you. Or to me.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cVictor had several favorites among his women. He kept track of who was invited when, but there were no names. We have photos, which is how I know Lacey was among them, but these women were not in the public eye. Even with photographs, locating them is difficult. If you wish to help, you could go through the files for us and see if you recognize anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Emma said eagerly. \u201cDid you bring them with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re heading out of town this evening. I wasn\u2019t certain you\u2019d be home. We\u2019re still checking out Victor\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to one of those party houses, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me with you.\u201d</p><p>Duncan regarded Emma silently. He wasn\u2019t used to being interrupted at every turn. Not many would have dared, not even in his years as Raphael\u2019s lieutenant, and he was somewhat surprised to discover just how much it irritated him. Emma, however, seemed blissfully unaware of both her transgression and his irritation.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded impatiently.</p><p>Duncan wasn\u2019t looking at Miguel, but he could feel his lieutenant\u2019s anger at Emma\u2019s rudeness, and it was like a fire burning hotter by the moment. As Duncan\u2019s child and his lieutenant, Miguel was instinctively protective not only of Duncan\u2019s person, but of his dignity.</p><p>\u201cIf I might finish,\u201d Duncan said gently.</p><p>Emma\u2019s pupils flared, her emotions signaling outrage and embarrassment in equal measure to his empathic senses. She blew out a calming breath, visibly trying to relax, and gestured for him to continue. Duncan almost grinned, his earlier irritation banished by the obvious effort it took her to remain silent.</p><p>\u201cI told you we would look into Lacey\u2019s disappearance,\u201d he began, \u201cand\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped. Emma had opened her mouth to interrupt him once again. Her mouth snapped closed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I promised,\u201d Duncan continued, his gaze daring her to say a word, \u201cthat I would get back to you in few days. This is me getting back to you. We are making progress, but we have found nothing concrete. If you give us a call tomorrow evening, we\u2019ll arrange a time for you to come by and look at the photographs.\u201d</p><p>Emma stared back at him silently, as if waiting to be sure he had nothing more to say, then said in a rush, \u201cCan I go with you tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Duncan used his vampire speed to step very close to Emma, very fast. To her, it would seem as if he hadn\u2019t moved, that he was suddenly just there. He was close enough that her breasts brushed against his chest when she inhaled, close enough that he could feel the heat off her skin and hear the pounding of her heart. And he saw the flash of arousal in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he said softly. He brushed the back of his fingers against the velvet softness of her cheek, wishing he didn\u2019t have to leave her here. But there would be other nights. He would make certain of it. \u201cIt will not be safe for you where we\u2019re going,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to trust me on this.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer, barely touching her mouth with his lips before stepping back with a pang of regret. \u201cMiguel,\u201d he said and turned, heading for the door.</p><p>Louis twisted the doorknob and stepped into the opening, pausing long enough to check out the street and get the go ahead signal from their security people by the SUVs before starting down the steps.</p><p>Duncan walked through the doorway. Behind him, Emma called out, \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, knowing first that nothing he said would satisfy her, and second that there was no way he was going to let her go with them. Even if he didn\u2019t have plans to stop at the blood house, he agreed with Miguel\u2019s assessment from last night. He had a bad feeling about this Leesburg house of Victor\u2019s, and he didn\u2019t want Emma anywhere near the place. He frowned, wondering at this sudden protective impulse he had for her.</p> <p>Emma\u2019s footsteps hurried across the wood floor behind him as he descended the stairs outside. Louis was already holding the SUV\u2019s door open while his driver, a vampire named Ari, stood in the open driver\u2019s door and confirmed that they were now heading for Leesburg. Miguel was close at Duncan\u2019s back, blocking Emma from trying to follow.</p><p>\u201cGo back inside, Ms. Duquet,\u201d Miguel said impatiently. And then suddenly Miguel was swearing softly, and Emma was crying out in pain.</p><p>Duncan spun back, his anger flaring abruptly. Miguel stood next to Emma, his hands in the air, indicating to Duncan that he hadn\u2019t touched her. But Emma was rubbing her arm and there were tears brightening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Duncan demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy lord\u2014\u201d Miguel began, but true to form, Emma overrode him.</p><p>\u201cYour guard dog here is built like a brick wall. I tried to follow you and ran into him.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan\u2019s anger cooled instantly. \u201cMiguel is my lieutenant, Emma, not a guard dog. He is also very serious about my security and trusts almost no one. You cannot go with us this evening. As a friend of mine would say, deal with it.\u201d</p><p>He nearly laughed at her expression\u2014she was gaping at him in outrage, speechless for a change. He and Miguel were down the stairs and inside the SUVs before she\u2019d recovered her wits, and the last thing he saw as they pulled away from the curb was Emma standing on her porch staring angrily in his direction.</p><p>Emma glared at the departing SUVs\u2014two big, black monstrosities that looked like tanks driving down the narrow street of her old neighborhood. All they needed was a big woofer in the back and they\u2019d look like every other pimp in this town.</p><p>Assholes.</p><p>She pursed her lips thoughtfully, and suddenly remembered the feel of Duncan\u2019s mouth on hers, the press of his hard chest against . . . She shrieked angrily. He\u2019d done that on purpose! He was trying to distract her, to lull her into being a good little human. An obedient human.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just see about that, vampire.\u201d</p><p>She rushed into the house, snagged her keys and her cell phone from the table, grabbed her bag, then turned around and raced back outside, delaying only long enough to lock her front door. It was cold, but she pulled her hood up and tucked her hands into the front pocket of the sweatshirt. Her car was right in front of house, and once she got inside, she could crank the heat as high as she wanted.</p><p>But she was not going to let them get away with this. She\u2019d heard what that vampire had said, the one driving the SUV with Duncan in it. He\u2019d called over to his buddies and said something about Leesburg, something like, \u201cWe\u2019re heading to Leesburg now?\u201d Or close enough.</p> <p>Well, it was a free country. She could go to Leesburg, too. Even better, she could find out if Victor had a house there. Did Duncan think he was the only one with connections? Well, think again. She worked for a damn congressman. Hell, her job was handling problems for constituents too lazy to do it for themselves; people who thought a few thousand bucks bought some help from their congressman . . . or his staff. And, come to think of it, they were right. But the upshot was that Emma had connections. And finding out who owned a piece of property pretty much anywhere in the country was a piece of cake.</p><p>She snapped her Bluetooth over her ear and was already placing phone calls by the time she turned toward the Beltway.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The Leesburg blood house was crowded when Duncan and his team arrived. This was no elegant house in the suburbs, like the one where Brendan and Erik hosted their tasteful weekend get-togethers. This was a blood house through and through. Backing up to a thick stand of trees and sitting on a wide open expanse of what had probably been farmland once upon a time, the house was a two-story red brick with white trim and an attached garage. It was a good-sized place, but dwarfed by the huge lot, making it seem smaller than it was. Cars were parked haphazardly all around the front, and Duncan couldn\u2019t help wondering what the neighbors thought was going on here. Not that they were close. The lights of the nearest house were barely visible in the distance, but the traffic of so many people coming and going from here should have been noticeable. Or maybe the people who lived on those comfortable estates didn\u2019t bother with what happened outside.</p><p>His driver, Ari, grunted unhappily at the mishmash of cars parked in front of the house. Jerking the wheel to one side, he cut across the field and pulled around back instead. Miguel and Louis both bailed from the SUV when it stopped, but Duncan sat and waited while the second vehicle parked behind them and his security team piled out and took up positions. He spent that time probing the crowded house, separating humans from vampires, or perhaps the other way around. Vampires burned so much brighter to his empathic senses than the humans did. And there were two or three very bright vampires inside this house. Interesting.</p><p>Miguel opened the door next to Duncan. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miguel,\u201d Duncan said and stepped out onto the half-frozen ground. He studied the back of the house. There were low lights in every window, and this close, he could feel the deep thumping base of the music playing inside. The garage was off to the left. To the right was a small porch with a closed door.</p><p>Miguel signaled as Duncan started for the porch. One of his vampires went ahead, making quick work of the lock. Not that it was a bad lock, but his staff were very good at such things. He tamped his power down, wanting to size the place up before announcing his presence.</p><p>The music hit him as soon as the door opened, much louder than he would have expected from hearing it outside. Someone had invested in some serious soundproofing, because modern houses weren\u2019t usually built that way. The extra sound dampening was a good sign, however, telling him the house was well run, that whoever was in charge was paying attention.</p><p>Duncan entered the house with only Miguel and Louis, leaving the others to secure the outside perimeter. If he needed them, they could be at his side in seconds, but he was more concerned about someone coming up behind him than taking him down from the inside.</p><p>The house was as crowded as he\u2019d expected, given the parking situation out front. The back door opened onto a long, narrow kitchen and den area, with a breakfast bar in between. The kitchen was nearly empty, but the room beyond was packed wall-to-wall with vampires and humans, some dancing to the music, and some only pretending to dance while they engaged in other pursuits. What furniture there was had been pushed up against the walls to make more room for the dancers. And he could both hear and sense more people upstairs, mostly having sex from the sound of it, which was perfectly normal for a blood house this big. That\u2019s what humans came here for, after all. They offered blood from the vein in exchange for a sexual high like no other. A hundred years ago, vampires hunted and took what they needed. Today the humans lined up for the privilege of opening their veins.</p><p>A pair of vamps were deep in conversation as Duncan came through the door. They glanced up, and one of them automatically straightened into an aggressive posture, but he took one look at Duncan and dropped his eyes, backing away until his ass hit the kitchen counter. The other vamp only stared, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cWho runs this place,\u201d Miguel snarled.</p><p>\u201cOtis,\u201d the wide-eyed vamp offered eagerly. \u201cHe\u2019s in there. I mean, through the next room and past the stairs. That\u2019s his place.\u201d</p><p>Miguel glanced over at Duncan, his expression somewhat troubled. Duncan was sure his lieutenant and he were sharing the same thought. Why had the vamp been so happy to give up Otis\u2019s name?</p><p>Only one way to find out. They started forward. The music was blaring as loudly as ever, as Duncan stepped into the room. He stood still for a moment, simply observing, and then he released his power. It rolled across the crowded room like a wave. One by one the dancers turned to stare, their eyes wide with recognition. They shrank back, pressing against the walls and taking their humans with them. Some fell to their knees, others whispered, \u201cMaster,\u201d as Duncan passed, following the suddenly wide open path through the crowded room.</p><p>He proceeded past the stairs, where a few more vampires froze in mid-step, staring at their new lord, and strolled into the high-ceilinged room beyond.</p><p>Otis, at least Duncan assumed this was Otis, was ensconced on a big, black leather sectional in a corner. The room was no doubt intended to be a formal living room, with its tall windows, elaborate chandelier and elegant stone hearth. Otis had made it his throne room. He sat in the light of a brightly burning fireplace. Holding court. There were no other words to describe it. His arms were stretched out to either side of the couch, while a human woman knelt between his wide spread legs performing oral sex. Thankfully, she was finishing her performance right about the time they walked into the room. She tucked Otis\u2019s cock gently back inside his jeans, then zipped him up with agonizing slowness, clearly terrified of making a mistake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, pet,\u201d Otis said lazily, closing his knees and trapping the woman between them. \u201cBut don\u2019t go far. I might need you again.\u201d</p><p>The woman, who\u2019d been poised to stand, closed her eyes in resignation and slumped back to the floor, resting her head on the sofa cushion between Otis\u2019s legs.</p><p>Another vampire approached Otis, this one wearing neatly pressed khakis and a button-down blue shirt, his dark hair cut short. He was holding a clipboard in one hand, a pencil in the other.</p> <p>\u201cLance is here, Otis,\u201d he said, reading something on his clipboard. \u201cIt\u2019s been three weeks, and I think it\u2019s time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn your knees when you talk to me, Nelson.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired vamp stiffened, and Duncan could see every muscle tightening as he tried to resist the order, but eventually he surrendered. His knees hit the carpeted floor with a dull thud.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy,\u201d Otis drawled. \u201cNow, what was it you wanted to ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLance,\u201d Nelson repeated sharply. \u201cIt\u2019s been three weeks\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck that bastard. Tell him to go someplace else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyplace else, Otis. You know that. He\u2019s been traveling over a hundred miles just to feed. That\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how far he\u2019s fucking traveling,\u201d Otis roared, sitting up and knocking the woman out of the way. \u201cLet him hunt! I don\u2019t want that bastard in my house or even my line of sight.\u201d He smiled then, and ran a casual hand back through his long hair, as if aware his outburst had made him seem out of control. And Duncan knew that control would be everything to someone like Otis.</p><p>\u201cSome vampires just aren\u2019t worth the effort, Nelson. You understand,\u201d he said with a sickening smirk. He started to lean back against the sofa, but caught sight of Duncan and his people. He sat up straight, his dark eyes skimming over each of them in turn, resting finally on Duncan.</p><p>\u201cWell, looky who\u2019s here, Nelson,\u201d he sneered. \u201cIt\u2019s our new lord come calling.\u201d</p><p>Nelson, still on his knees, twisted around to stare at Duncan. His face registered first surprise, and then a fierce satisfaction. He grabbed the woman, dragging her with him, as if clearing a path between Otis and their new vampire lord.</p> <p>\u201cFeel free to help yourselves, boys,\u201d Otis said, waving a casual hand at the crowded house. \u201cWe\u2019ve a full house tonight.\u201d</p><p>Miguel stiffened, a growl rumbling in his chest. Duncan rested a hand on his forearm.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, Nelson. Get these boys a room. It\u2019s okay, gents. We\u2019re an equal opportunity establishment, if you get my drift. Maybe a nice boy for dinner?\u201d Otis laughed loudly, amused by his own pathetic wit.</p><p>\u201cMiguel,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cGet rid of the humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Otis shot to his feet. \u201cThis fucking house is mine! I give the orders, not you.\u201d</p><p>The woman broke away from Nelson to stagger over to the door, and Miguel shoved her out of the room as he muttered orders into his Bluetooth mike. Several more of Duncan\u2019s people slammed into the house and began scouring it from room to room, racing up the stairs to clear the second floor. Humans screamed and vamps roared, but the noise quickly abated as the local vamps realized what was happening and helped herd the humans out of the house. Within moments, the only hearts that could be heard beating were the vampires\u2019.</p><p>\u201cNelson,\u201d Duncan said, drawing the startled attention of the preppy vampire with the clipboard. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Otis demanded. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are! Nelson belongs to me.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan ignored him, turning his attention instead to Nelson, who had scrambled over on his knees and was now gazing up at Duncan with unconcealed longing.</p><p>\u201cNelson? Is that your full name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNelson Conway, my lord. But everyone calls me Nelson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. You\u2019re our master, the new Lord of the Capital Territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you run this establishment, Nelson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he does not!\u201d Otis roared, jumping over the glass coffee table to confront Duncan. \u201cThis is my house and he\u2019s my fucking child. I turned him to handle all this shit.\u201d</p><p>Duncan shifted his gaze to Otis, but didn\u2019t waste any words on him. With a silent exertion of his will, he drove the angry vampire to his knees and choked away his voice. Otis\u2019s face twisted with rage as he crashed to the floor at Duncan\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cNelson?\u201dDuncan prompted, bringing the other vampire\u2019s attention back to him.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord, I run the house. Otis makes policy. He decides who gets in how often, and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d he added with a dark look in his Sire\u2019s direction. \u201cBut I\u2019m the one who manages everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you volunteer for this job? Did you ask to be made Vampire?\u201d</p><p>Nelson stared up at Duncan, as if trying to figure out the right answer to the question.</p><p>\u201cThe truth will do,\u201d Duncan prompted quietly.</p><p>The preppy vampire glanced away, as if ashamed or embarrassed, then lowered his eyes, speaking to the floor. \u201cNo, my lord. I was in Leesburg visiting some friends. That was more than two years ago, though it seems even longer. We all came to this blood house together, on a stupid dare. When Otis found out I had graduated from business school, he started hitting on me, even though I told him\u2014\u201d</p><p>The young vampire broke off, his face heating, and his embarrassment now obvious. Duncan could easily imagine how someone like Otis would have single-mindedly pursued the young human, seducing him into sex not because he wanted him, but because it suited his need at the time. If Nelson had been drunk, which seemed likely, it would have been easy for Otis to seduce him. And once he\u2019d bitten the young man, the powerful euphoric substance in his bite would have wiped away whatever was left of Nelson\u2019s will. Until he woke the next night and remembered what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nelson,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cIf I could reverse it, I would.\u201d</p><p>Nelson looked up and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, my lord. I still hate what he did to me that night, and I was shocked to discover what I\u2019d become, but . . . it\u2019s not so bad now. And I don\u2019t mind running this house, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d He shot a hate-filled glance at Otis, but didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Duncan said into the silence. \u201cMiguel, if you would?\u201d</p><p>Miguel produced a four inch switchblade as Duncan drew his leather jacket off and threw it onto the coffee table. He shoved up the sweater sleeve on his left arm.</p><p>\u201cNelson Conway, do you come to me of your own free will and desire?\u201d he asked formally.</p><p>Nelson\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, then he turned sharply, staring in fear as Otis began thrashing like a fish on a hook. But the vampire was unable to speak or to rise from his knees.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him,\u201d Duncan said dismissively. \u201cUnless you\u2019d rather remain his?\u201d</p><p>Nelson\u2019s head swung back around to Duncan. \u201cHell, no,\u201d he growled. \u201cEr, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cThen let us begin again. Nelson Conway, do you come to me of your own free will and desire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, my lord,\u201d he said fervently.</p><p>\u201cAnd is this what you truly desire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord, it is my truest desire.\u201d</p><p>Duncan sliced open a clean line between the tendons, from the middle of his forearm down to his wrist. Blood swelled from the wound in round droplets, turning quickly to a slow, steady rush of red.</p><p>Nelson stared, his breath coming in pants, tongue poking out to lick his lips hungrily.</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t taunt the young vampire by holding back. There was no need. Nelson had been his from the moment he\u2019d walked into this house.</p><p>\u201cDrink, Nelson,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd be mine.\u201d</p><p>Duncan gazed down at Nelson\u2019s bent head and felt the tug deep in his chest as yet another soul became his to guard, his to care for. Nelson didn\u2019t gulp, but he didn\u2019t waste a drop either. There was a precision to his drinking, the way some people eat an ice cream cone by constantly licking all around, keeping the cone neat and tidy, while others end up with a big mess. Nelson was a tidy drinker. It was probably the same quality that made him a good house manager.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Duncan said gently. Nelson lifted his head at once, settling back on his heels with a glazed look. Miguel produced a handkerchief for Duncan\u2019s arm, and Duncan figured he must have a goodly supply of them somewhere. Boxes of plain, white handkerchiefs for the too frequent times when his master slit his own wrist. He smiled at the idea, wiping the kerchief up his arm before wrapping it carefully and snugging his sweater sleeve down. Duncan\u2019s blood was powerful enough that the wound would begin to close in minutes, and would heal completely in a hour. There was a healing property in Nelson\u2019s saliva, as in every other vampire\u2019s. But it only worked on humans, not on another vampire.</p><p>\u201cThis house is yours, Nelson,\u201d Duncan said as he pulled his jacket back on. \u201cIt has only one purpose, and that is to feed my vampires. All of my vampires. If you see someone you don\u2019t know, you may request identification. If you have doubts, you will call Miguel or Louis.\u201d He nodded at his respective aides. \u201cBut no one is to be turned away unless they break the rules. And there are only two rules. No drugs. No violence. And we observe human laws within the limits of our needs. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Nelson said, still breathless from the effects of drinking Duncan\u2019s potent blood. His eyes opened wide suddenly, and he leaned forward to whisper, \u201cWhat about him?\u201d His gaze shifted slightly toward Otis.</p><p>Duncan turned to regard the former house manager. \u201cOtis, I\u2019m afraid your services are no longer required,\u201d he said, baring his teeth in a predator\u2019s grin. \u201cSome vampires just aren\u2019t worth the effort. You understand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Otis\u2019s eyes bulged even further, if such a thing were possible, his throat working as he fought to scream. Duncan\u2019s power reached out and simply stopped his heart from beating.</p><p>Nelson scooted aside, brushing his khaki pants fastidiously as Otis crumbled into a pile of greasy dust. \u201cUh, shall I\u2014\u201d he fumbled to say. \u201cI mean is it okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means, Nelson,\u201d Duncan said cheerfully. \u201cFeel free to vacuum, and remember, if you need anything, call. But, know this. I keep track of my people, and I know what\u2019s going on in my territory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my lord. I won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. One last question, did Victor come here often?\u201d</p><p>Nelson gave him a blank look. \u201cVictor, my lord? He was never here, that I know of, and I\u2019ve been at this house almost every night for two years.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cAs I suspected. Thank you, Nelson. Miguel, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>With the humans gone, it took far less time to get out of the house than it had to get in. Someone snapped the music off as Duncan made his way through the den, and the silence was deafening. The house was still crowded, but with kneeling vampires who inched aside, clearing a path with bowed heads, murmuring their allegiance as Duncan walked past.</p> <p>At some point in the future, he\u2019d come back here, more than once if he lasted that long\u2014and he had every intention of lasting a very long time. He wanted to know the vampires in his territory. Wanted to know the lives he held in his hands. But tonight he had other, more pressing business.</p><p>Duncan stepped out of the overheated house and lifted his face, welcoming the brush of cold air over his skin as he drew a deep breath. His security people waited, standing all around him with infinite patience.</p><p>\u201cHow far to Victor\u2019s house, Louis?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour, my lord. No more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going next.\u201d</p><p>The SUVs raced down the dark roads, the people of Leesburg safely tucked away behind the walls of their houses, not knowing that vampires were speeding by in the dead of night. The convoy turned off the main road and passed through a well-lit neighborhood of neat, modern homes before leaving the lights behind once again. Victor\u2019s house\u2014now Duncan\u2019s\u2014was a few miles beyond, down a two-lane road with wide, grassy fields to either side. A spacious home was perched in the middle of each of those fields, well away from the road and up on a low hillside, as if to better gaze down upon their less fortunate neighbors.</p> <p>The address Duncan and his people sought was down a sharp turn to the right, and then a long driveway ending in a square of neatly trimmed spruce trees, growing tightly together to create a barrier against casual observation. The driveway split through the trees to reveal a sprawling white clapboard house, with an old-fashioned covered porch along the entire front face. A single chimney and multiple peaked roofs made it look like a farmhouse on steroids.</p><p>Duncan had no sooner taken in the sight of the house, than Louis was jumping from the still-moving vehicle, snapping commands into his headset. The trailing SUV raced past, leaving muddy tracks on the perfectly maintained green lawn as it swerved around and back onto the driveway, tires squealing as it skidded to a stop in front of Duncan\u2019s SUV.</p><p>\u201cMiguel, what\u2014\u201d Duncan started, then saw the car parked to one side of the huge house. Damn her. \u201cNo one touches her, Miguel,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cLet me out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut, Miguel. Now.\u201d</p><p>He heard her voice before he saw her. Standing on the front porch, waiting for them like she owned the place, was Emma, the thorn in his side. Despite himself, he grinned, thinking it might well be worth a few scratches for a taste of Emma Duquet.</p><p>His people ushered her off the porch and away from the house, surrounding her with a wall of impenetrable vampire bulk. Obedient to his orders, no one touched her, but they didn\u2019t give her a choice, either. She either moved, or she would be crushed.</p><p>Duncan gestured, telling his vamps to fade back, and then he waited, knowing she\u2019d never be able to remain silent.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded, meeting his calm stare.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Emma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably the same reason you are,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where we were going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I work in this town. I have sources, too.\u201d Her lips were pinched defiantly as she glared up at him, her violet eyes silvering in the new moon\u2019s light. She shuddered suddenly, and he realized she wasn\u2019t wearing anything but the hooded sweatshirt she\u2019d put on back home.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold,\u201d he murmured and shrugged off his leather jacket, wrapping it around her shoulders before tucking her against his body and rubbing his hands up and down her back. She shivered again, almost violently, burying her face against his chest.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he said quietly against her ear. \u201cWhat if someone had been waiting for you here?\u201d</p><p>She spoke without raising her head, clutching his jacket closer. \u201cThe house is empty. I already checked it out through the windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known it would be empty,\u201d he said, exasperated. \u201cAnd you still don\u2019t. Just because you didn\u2019t see anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said,\u201d she shuddered once, hard, then grew still, as if her body had expressed its displeasure with the cold temperature one final time before admitting it was now warm. \u201cYou said Victor was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, but there were others involved, and we know nothing about them yet. It\u2019s not safe for you to be here, certainly not alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re here now.\u201d She looked up, giving him big eyes, as if that could fool him into believing her innocent. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep me safe, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have been safe if you\u2019d stayed home, as I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here now.\u201d Her voice sharpened, and he almost smiled. He\u2019d known she couldn\u2019t keep up the wide-eyed fa\u00e7ade for long.</p><p>Duncan ran his hands up and down her arms, as if still trying to warm her, using it as an excuse to delay\u2014and to think. He didn\u2019t want Emma anywhere near whatever Victor may have done in this house. The knowledge alone could be dangerous. But he understood all too well her need to know the truth about Lacey\u2019s disappearance, her need to do something.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Emma,\u201d he whispered, feeling her grow still as she listened to him. \u201cI could take away your memories of this entire evening and send you home none the wiser.\u201d</p><p>She drew back from him with a jerk, searching his face. \u201cI\u2019d never forgive you if you did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never know. There\u2019d be nothing to forgive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d know,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>Duncan did smile then. She was stubborn as a mule, this one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be perfectly quiet. I promise,\u201d she wheedled, clearly sensing his weakening resolve.</p><p>Duncan sighed. \u201cVery well. But you will remain right by my side. And you will do whatever I say when I say it, no arguments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s nothing ridiculous,\u201d she muttered.</p><p> SheRidiculous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. If you tell me to bark like a dog or something, I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed and hugged her tightly before letting her go. \u201cVery well. No barking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want this back,\u201d she said, making a halfhearted move toward pulling the jacket off.</p><p>Duncan stopped her with a hand on her arm. \u201cKeep it. You should have worn something warmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have time. I wanted to get here before you guys, so I grabbed my keys and ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should keep a jacket in your car. You know, for your next close pursuit.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a quizzical glance, as if trying to figure out if that was a joke or not.</p><p>Duncan let her wonder. He took her hand and headed for the front door. \u201cRemember your promise, Emma. What I say, when I say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Your wish is my command and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only it were that simple.\u201d</p><p>Miguel sent two of the security detail around to check the house from the outside. The others accompanied Duncan, most of them going in ahead of him.</p><p>Duncan scanned the front of the house as he approached, searching the many windows, although he wasn\u2019t certain what he was looking for. That bad feeling Miguel had talked about was getting worse by the moment, and he already regretted letting Emma stay. He should have wiped her mind and sent her home. Forget what she\u2019d said about remembering. He was very good at what he did, and she wouldn\u2019t have remembered a thing. The problem was it felt wrong to do that to Emma. That didn\u2019t make any sense to him, but something in his mind\u2014or his heart\u2014told him to be honest with her, or he\u2019d regret it later.</p><p>Miguel held back a few moments, letting the security team go ahead. Lights soon came on inside, dimmed severely. It was the kind of lighting a vampire would prefer, and the hell with whatever human guests might be joining him. Typical Victor. But Duncan was glad for it, because he could already detect the unmistakable scent of old blood. A lot of it. And if that much blood had been spilt in this house, he didn\u2019t want the glare of bright lights distracting him from whatever his other senses might have to tell him.</p><p>He walked through the doorway with Emma, who squeezed his hand tightly despite her earlier brave words. He took three slow steps and stopped, nearly crushed as his empathic senses were inundated by the pain and fear saturating every wall, every floorboard, every damn inch of this house.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he said in a strained voice. \u201cGo back to your car.\u201d</p><p>Her head whipped around. \u201cDuncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Emma, please. Miguel, have someone stay with her.\u201d His lieutenant moved to take Emma\u2019s arm, and Duncan added, \u201cGently, Miguel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d Emma repeated, her voice trembling with uncertainty. She might not have his exquisite sensibilities, but she wouldn\u2019t need them to know something was wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out soon. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>He heard more than saw Emma leave the house, heard Miguel order one of the vamps to stay with her at the car. And then his lieutenant was back.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel it, Miguel?\u201d Duncan whispered, and sent a fraction of what he was sensing down the link he shared with his vampire child.</p> <p>Miguel sucked in a breath. \u201cSick fuck,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cNot sick,\u201d Duncan corrected softly. \u201cEvil.\u201d His gaze traveled up the wide staircase. It would be worse up there. So much worse. \u201cUpstairs,\u201d he said.</p><p>Miguel sent one of his vampire guards up ahead of him, but Duncan knew they\u2019d find nothing. There was nothing to see any longer, only to feel. He tightened his shields down hard, needing to know what had happened, but unwilling to let the full measure of Victor\u2019s corruption swamp his senses. What he was feeling was horrific enough. He didn\u2019t need to drown in it.</p><p>He climbed the stairs slowly, reluctantly, for all that he was determined to do it. At the top of the stairs, he turned unerringly to the right, the waves of pain and terror like the fingers of a ghost, tugging at his clothing, drawing him closer.</p><p>They passed the first room, and the second. Duncan paused, looking ahead. Every one of the rooms up here reeked of lust, of a hunger that would never be satisfied. But the worst of it, the true depths of depravity that had been perpetrated here . . . that had happened in the room at the end of the hall. The door was closed. Duncan wished it could stay that way.</p> <p>His fangs emerged, sliding over his lower lip unbidden, as he stared at that closed door\u2014as he stalked down the hall to that nightmare chamber. Next to him, Miguel gave him a startled glance, his own fangs appearing in response to Duncan\u2019s obvious anger. Duncan almost staggered when it finally hit him, a red haze filling his vision. He opened the door and halted there, unwilling to cross the threshold. He heard the voices of men laughing, swearing, grunting in release. And he heard the terrified cries of women begging for mercy, screaming in agony.</p><p>He swallowed a furious howl, biting down so hard that his fangs sliced his lip. Blood dripped down to his chin, warm and thick. He licked it up without thinking, lost in the memory of what had been done here, of how far they\u2019d gone to satisfy their perverted need to inflict pain on the helpless.</p><p>Duncan spun on his heel, unable to bear another moment within that agony-soaked room. It ran in invisible rivulets down the walls, rotting the boards, the carpets; everything it touched was fouled by what had happened there.</p><p>He strode back toward the staircase. He needed to get outside before the leftover emotions destroyed what was left of his shields. He shuddered at the thought of facing the searing pain of that house without even a shred of protection.</p><p>Miguel hurried next to him, his worried gaze searching every room they passed, not knowing what he was looking for, but feeling the tiniest part of what Duncan was drowning in. Duncan started down the stairs, forcing himself to take them one at a time, when all he wanted was to jump the banister and race outside.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, what did you find? What should I tell the others to look for?\u201d</p> <p>They reached the first floor. The nightmare lifted enough that Duncan felt as if he could breathe again. \u201cTell them to search\u2014\u201d He paused, detecting a fresh sense of alarm from . . . was it Ari? \u201cIs Ari outside?\u201d he asked Miguel quickly.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. The backyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Miguel pointed through an arched doorway on their left. They raced through a huge dining room to a wide open kitchen with two sets of French doors that opened onto a covered patio. Miguel snapped the handles down hard, not bothering with locks, and Duncan strode outside, quickly finding Ari where he stood head down, staring at the ground, tension radiating from every muscle. Duncan frowned. There was nothing here, except\u2014</p><p>It hit him then, a whiff of decay on the night breeze, growing stronger the closer he got to Ari. When Duncan finally reached his side, the dark-haired vampire looked up, his coffee brown eyes gleaming with wild power that yearned for an enemy to strike down. But there was no enemy here. There was only the dead their enemy had left behind.</p><p>Duncan reached out to his vampire\u2014and Ari was his, not a child of his own, but sworn to him in blood\u2014and calmed Ari\u2019s rage with the touch of his power.</p><p>Together they studied the minuscule disturbances that spoke loudly to those who knew what to look for, even without the smell of death to guide them. To the untrained eye, there was nothing to see but dirt and a little bit of grass that was dry and brown from the winter. No one had bothered to lay down green turf, as they obviously had in the front yard before Victor\u2019s last party. Had that been the one Lacey attended? If Duncan had still believed in a merciful God, he would have offered a prayer that it not be so. He didn\u2019t want Emma to lose her friend that way, didn\u2019t want her search to end here in this house of horrors. But the world had proven to him long ago that faith had no place in this world.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI have to talk to Emma first. Then I\u2019ll make the call.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Emma was sitting in her car, the engine running to keep the heater blowing, because despite Duncan\u2019s jacket, she was freezing. It was more than the winter temperature making her cold. She was scared. More scared than she could ever remember being. More than when she\u2019d been forced to kiss her dead grandmother as she lay in the casket. Even more than when her mother had died and left her all alone. She\u2019d been too young then to appreciate all the things that could go wrong, and young enough to believe she\u2019d be fine on her own.</p><p>But not anymore. She knew exactly how the world delighted in fucking with her by taking away everything. Everything but Lacey. If she lost Lacey, too . . . She convulsed in a fresh round of shivering, and turned the heater up another notch.</p><p>Something awful had happened in that house. Duncan was a master at keeping anything from showing on his face, but his very stillness told her it was bad. If he was working that hard at keeping it inside, it had to be very, very bad.</p><p>And she was terrified.</p><p>The vampire standing guard on her stiffened abruptly, his gaze riveted over the top of her car, around the right side of the house. Emma stared through the windshield. Was something coming? Was it whatever awful thing lived in that house?</p><p>She caught a flash of movement, and saw one of Duncan\u2019s vampires racing around the house and into the backyard. Curiosity won out over fear, and she opened the car door enough to put one foot on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked her guard. \u201cHave they found something?\u201d</p><p>The guard didn\u2019t respond right away, his attention wholly focused on whatever was happening beyond the house. Emma was about to ask him again when he turned and urged her back into the car. \u201cYou should stay inside,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cIt\u2019s warmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What did they find?\u201d she asked, searching his face, knowing somehow that she was right. They\u2019d found something. Not in the house, but behind it. She\u2019d been back there before Duncan arrived, and there was nothing there except a strip of covered patio. Beyond that was a wide patch of dead lawn and then open field. What had they seen that she hadn\u2019t? What could there be\u2014</p><p>Emma\u2019s breath caught as pain squeezed her chest. She must have made a noise of some sort, because the guard reached out to her, the look of sorrow on his face confirming her worst fears.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo!\u201d she screamed and shoved the door wide open, knocking it into the guard and throwing him off balance. She raced for the backyard, knowing she\u2019d never make it, that the guard\u2019s vampire speed would catch her and stop her, but she ran anyway. She had to see, had to know . . .</p><p>The guard grabbed her before she\u2019d gotten two steps down the side of the big house, scooping her up and wrapping her tightly in iron hard arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna do that,\u201d he whispered against her ear. \u201cTrust me, Emma. You don\u2019t wanna see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of her, Baldwin.\u201d Duncan\u2019s voice was hard as he walked toward them.</p><p>Her guard, Baldwin, released her immediately. \u201cForgive me, my lord,\u201d he said.</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t know what he was apologizing for\u2014letting her get away or holding her too tightly, but whatever it was, she didn\u2019t care. \u201cTell me what you found,\u201d she told Duncan. \u201cAnd don\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>Duncan closed the distance between them, his hands coming out to take hers and pull her into a rough embrace. \u201cEmma,\u201d he started, but she pushed away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t coddle me like some fragile flower who can\u2019t handle life. I\u2019ve been taking care of myself since I was eleven years old, so don\u2019t you do that. Tell me what you found,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Duncan sighed. \u201cA body. We\u2019re\u2014\u201d Emma made a pained noise in spite of herself, her fist coming up to her mouth as if to trap the sound inside. Duncan paused. \u201cEmma, Baldwin\u2019s right. You don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I want! Is it a woman?\u201d</p><p>He studied her a moment, then turned his head slightly, as if listening to what was happening in the yard. When he turned back and met her gaze, she knew. \u201cYes,\u201d he said unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cI want to see. If it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not necessary. We have a picture of Lacey, and they\u2019ve buried her things with her. We can identify\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see,\u201d Emma repeated in an uncompromising voice that she barely recognized as being her own. \u201cIt\u2019s my right, Duncan. She\u2019s my\u2014\u201d Emotion stole her voice, and she drew a breath, turning away for a moment. \u201cLacey\u2019s my friend,\u201d she continued, ignoring the hot tears rolling down her cheeks. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Duncan clearly didn\u2019t want to give in, but he just as clearly believed that what Emma was saying was true. It was her right to be the one, her right to lay claim to Lacey, and no one else\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said unhappily. \u201cYou may view the body. But, Emma, decomposition has already begun. You may no longer recognize Lacey even if it\u2019s her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll recognize her,\u201d Emma insisted stubbornly.</p><p>Duncan frowned and shook his head slightly, as if already regretting his decision. \u201cYou will tell me if you think it\u2019s Lacey or not,\u201d he said finally. \u201cAnd then you will leave. Baldwin will drive you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if it\u2019s Lacey\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake it or leave it,\u201d he said, his voice every bit as uncompromising as hers had been.</p><p>Emma nodded once. Duncan reached for her hand, but she pulled away, choosing to proceed under her own power.</p><p>She moved in a blur, her eyes so filled with tears she could barely see. Her mind kept whispering denials, kept telling her it didn\u2019t have to be Lacey, that there\u2019d been other women at the parties, that this house and Victor had been around for years, and that the land around here was riddled with old burial grounds. But in her heart she knew what she\u2019d known ever since Lacey hadn\u2019t come home Sunday night. She\u2019d known that something awful had happened, because nothing else would have kept Lacey from calling her. And now . . .</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Duncan\u2019s voice next to her was gentle, full of compassion. But she didn\u2019t want his compassion, couldn\u2019t afford it. She had to stay strong. She looked around and realized Duncan\u2019s vampires were all looking at her expectantly. They were standing in a circle around something, and now had opened the circle as if to admit her. She looked down and her heart began to pound.</p><p>\u201cEmma, you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p> <p>She brushed away Duncan\u2019s hand and stepped between two of the vampires, nearly tripping on a pile of dirt. One of the vamps caught her arm, and she looked down into a big hole in the ground. No, not so big. Just big enough for . .</p><p>A cry of denial was torn from her throat, a wordless, animal sound of grief. Emma stumbled as she backed away, suddenly wishing she hadn\u2019t insisted on being here. She didn\u2019t want to see what was in that hole, didn\u2019t want to see that dead thing wearing a grotesque caricature of Lacey\u2019s face, her blond curls limp and tangled, her limbs twisted in death as they\u2019d never been in life. She wanted to rewind her life and keep Lacey home from Victor\u2019s party. They\u2019d eat popcorn and drink bad wine and watch cheesy horror flicks until neither one of them could sleep. And they\u2019d never have to worry about anything worse than movie monsters under the bed.</p><p>\u201cEmma.\u201d She hadn\u2019t even seen Duncan move, but suddenly he was there, wrapping her in his arms. And she knew the monsters were real this time.</p><p>She shoved away from him. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d she hissed. \u201cIf not for you\u2014\u201d She knew she was being unfair, that it wasn\u2019t Duncan who\u2019d put Lacey in that grave. But it was his people. Vampires. Monsters who preyed on humans, who seduced Lacey with their promises of wild parties and high living. She stumbled down the side of the house, bracing herself against the wall, determined to get back to her car. She had her cell phone there. She\u2019d call the police and\u2014</p><p>Duncan\u2019s strong arms scooped her up. She fought against him, but he only tightened his hold and ordered, \u201cStop it, Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me down,\u201d she demanded, pounding on his shoulders, hearing herself sob with grief and not recognizing it as coming from her own throat. \u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Duncan\u2019s arms were like steel bands as he carried her to the front of the house, anger radiating off of him in waves, though somehow she knew the anger wasn\u2019t directed at her. Emma saw her car, saw Baldwin rushing ahead to open the door. Duncan lowered his head to her ear and whispered something.</p><p>And then there was nothing at all.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Duncan watched Emma\u2019s car until it rolled beyond the line of spruce trees and he couldn\u2019t see it anymore. She was in the backseat, sleeping deeply, and she\u2019d stay that way for several hours, until Lacey\u2019s body had been recovered and the scene processed. He and his team had a few hours left, but they would have to return to D.C. before morning. There was no way he\u2019d ask any of his people to spend a single day sleeping in this nightmare of a house. When they were finished here, when the forensic people had recovered every last bit of evidence they could find, he\u2019d have the whole damned building razed to the ground. After that, the land could sit fallow. Maybe in a century or three, the horror would fade.</p><p>He\u2019d already called the experts in to deal with this. If there could be any good fortune in this tragedy, it was that it had happened in Virginia, with the FBI\u2019s Quantico facilities so close by. Several vampires worked in the labs there, although their identities were known to only a select few in the vampire community. Raphael, of course, knew who they were, which meant Duncan did, too. The death he and his vampires had discovered here tonight couldn\u2019t be covered up completely, but it could be managed. How well depended on Emma. If she went to the human authorities and demanded an investigation . . . Well, he wouldn\u2019t let it come to that. He didn\u2019t want to replace her memories, but he would if necessary, knowing that if she ever found out, he would lose her trust, and might very well lose her. But he could not jeopardize the whole of vampire society for the sake of his affection for Emma Duquet.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he discounted the crime committed. He might cover up the specifics, but he wouldn\u2019t forget the offense. Victor was already dead, along with his four vampire guards, all of whom had no doubt participated in the violence and blood fest. But there were others still out there, humans who had willfully, joyfully, joined in the torture of young women for sexual gratification. He would hunt them down and destroy them every bit as permanently as he\u2019d destroyed Victor.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d</p><p>Duncan turned. \u201cYes, Miguel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the house, my lord. In what we believe is Victor\u2019s safe room. There are videos.\u201d</p><p>Duncan met his lieutenant\u2019s carefully shuttered gaze, and knew the night was about to get worse. He sighed wearily and placed a comforting hand on Miguel\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAt least now we\u2019ll know who to kill next, Miguel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hunt, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll run them to the ground and listen to them beg as we shred their beating hearts.\u201d</p><p>Miguel bared his teeth, growling his approval, and Duncan braced himself to enter that house of evil one more time. As he crossed the threshold and the horror pierced his soul, he had only one thought\u2014despite the agony of his last breath, Victor had been granted far too gentle a death.</p><p>An hour later, he sat on the front porch, taking in some much needed fresh air, when an unfamiliar truck rolled up to the house. He stood, eyeing it warily. As if by magic, several of his vampires appeared, taking up positions between him and the approaching vehicle. It rolled to a stop and Duncan watched as a small, dark-haired vampire dropped first to the running board and then to the ground. Her mane of bushy black hair had been pulled away from her face and forced into a severe bun at the back of her head, and she wore a plain, dark pantsuit and black cotton blouse. Together they made her appear older than she was, or rather, older than she\u2019d been when she\u2019d been turned over a century ago.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe,\u201d Duncan called out, sending a mental command to his guards that this was the forensic expert he\u2019d been expecting.</p><p>Phoebe Micheletti had never been an FBI agent herself, but she\u2019d trained with one of their finest investigators, a human male who\u2019d later become her husband and mate. After years of sharing the mate bond, and blood, with Phoebe, Ted Micheletti had been forced to retire early from the FBI when it became too obvious that he wasn\u2019t aging. The two of them now ran a consulting business of their own, offering their investigative services to law enforcement agencies around the country, many of whom couldn\u2019t afford to keep a full-time investigator on staff. Duncan was sure business was booming in these difficult economic times, and he knew that sometimes Phoebe and her mate worked for free. They simply enjoyed their work.</p><p>\u201cDuncan.\u201d She started to kneel, but Duncan stopped her. Phoebe lived in Virginia, which meant Duncan was officially her master now. But, though they\u2019d never met in person before, they\u2019d known each other for years, and he was too weary tonight for meaningless ritual.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, my lord. Congratulations on your ascension.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded, and Phoebe looked beyond him to the open back of a cargo van where two vampire forensic techs were loading a black body bag. There\u2019d been no need to leave Lacey\u2019s body in situ, no need to preserve the grave site. They already knew who\u2019d killed her.</p><p>\u201cDo we know who she is?\u201d Phoebe asked.</p><p>\u201cLacey Cray,\u201d Duncan said somberly. \u201cTwenty-seven years old, and a secretary on K Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she end up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Phoebe swore viciously. \u201cI hated that bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely, he didn\u2019t mistreat you or Ted?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head swiftly. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have dared. Victor was a typical bully. He only picked on people who couldn\u2019t fight back. So how do you know the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer roommate came to the house in D.C. the night after I disposed of Victor. Ms. Cray was missing. She\u2019d apparently partied with Victor before, but she told Emma this was a big one. A weekend in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma Duquet, the roommate. She works for a congressman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a complication. Does it get any worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrace yourself,\u201d Duncan warned her. \u201cVictor was quite the voyeur. We\u2019ve found video records of what went on here and in D.C. I don\u2019t know if he was blackmailing anyone, or if he just liked to watch. We\u2019re still working on identifying everyone, but Lacey\u2019s is the only body we\u2019ve found\u2014and the only woman from his files who isn\u2019t in any of the videos, which is telling in and of itself. I\u2019m assuming at this point that the other women are still alive. If so, their memories have probably been wiped, which is a blessing, because the things that were done to them\u2014\u201d His mouth twisted and he looked away, unwilling to go on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about Lacey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was probably an accident.

She gave him a crooked smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, my lord. We needed you.\u201d The smile fled as she turned her attention to Lacey\u2019s still form. \u201cI only wish you\u2019d had a better greeting than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d arrived a week earlier. Lacey might still be alive. We need to keep this quiet, Phoebe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes she have family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Emma. They\u2019ve been friends since childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this Emma going to raise a fuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d When Phoebe\u2019s curious gaze met his, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d He let a touch of power chill his voice to remind her who he was.</p><p>Phoebe lowered her eyes briefly. \u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cMy security chief, Louis, is upstairs, along with a couple of others. We\u2019ll take the computers and files back to D.C. with us, but in the meantime, he\u2019s made a composite file of every face visible in the videos. Some of them we think we know, but I want you to help track down the others.\u201d</p> <p>She stiffened, then bowed formally from the waist. \u201cI am yours to command, my lord.\u201d She spun around and headed into the house. Duncan watched her go, then walked over to the forensic tech who was closing the doors of the cargo van.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a place to store the body?\u201d Duncan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. One of ours owns a funeral home right outside Falls Church. We can leave her there for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure Miguel has the information on the funeral home before you leave, but you should go soon.\u201d Sunrise was only a couple hours away, and they\u2019d need that time to get Lacey\u2019s body properly stored before going home to sleep through the day.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d The vampire pulled a sheet of paper from the bottom of his clipboard, wrote briefly and handed the sheet to Miguel, who\u2019d followed Duncan like a shadow ever since they\u2019d found the body.</p><p>\u201cWe should leave, too, my lord,\u201d Miguel said quietly as the vampire tech climbed into the van and drove away.</p><p>Duncan looked over from his contemplation of the departing van. \u201cI need to stop at Emma\u2019s on the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, the time\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiguel,\u201d Duncan said softly. \u201cI will stop and speak with Emma.\u201d</p><p>Miguel nodded sharply. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave at once then. Ari can drive. I\u2019ll have the others finish up here and lock the house. They can take the second truck back to D.C.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. He didn\u2019t look forward to telling Emma what had to be done, but he couldn\u2019t let her go to the human authorities. Somehow he\u2019d have to persuade her to let him handle it, and if he couldn\u2019t . . . Well, then he wanted one last time with her before she hated him forever.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Emma\u2019s car was parked a few doors down from her house when they arrived. Duncan sent a thread of power into the house, searching. Baldwin was there, and aware. Baldwin was one of those who\u2019d been with Duncan the other night, which meant he\u2019d already been invited into Emma\u2019s house. That was important since Emma had been deeply asleep and would remain that way until Duncan woke her. He sighed, hoping she was having sweet dreams, because when she woke the nightmare would become real.</p><p>He would have preferred to put this off until tomorrow night. The horrors of Victor\u2019s playhouse had left him riding the very edge of violence, and he wanted nothing more at this point than to pound someone to a bloody pulp. Not that he would ever harm Emma. But his temper was definitely frayed, and she was bound to argue with him.</p><p>Duncan knew his reputation, what some considered his uncanny ability to remain calm in the face of even the worst provocation. It was why Raphael had decided he\u2019d be perfect for dealing with the human charlatans who masqueraded as leaders in Washington, D.C. And there was truth to Duncan\u2019s reputation, too. But it was a hard-won truth, and tonight his reserve had been severely tested.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t keep Emma asleep until he woke tomorrow night, and he definitely did not want her waking up during the day without talking to him first. Knowing Emma, even as little as he did, he knew she wouldn\u2019t hang around waiting for sunset. Even if she didn\u2019t call the police, she\u2019d drive herself back to Leesburg, where she would find nothing at all. The body was gone, as was all evidence that anyone had been buried there. Everything in the house that could lead back to Victor or vampires in general was likewise gone. It was already on its way to the residence in D.C., where Duncan\u2019s people would scour it for information and then destroy it. At this moment, even the title to the Leesburg house was being altered, with documents put in place that made it appear the house had changed ownership some months ago. Not even Emma\u2019s inside sources would be able to find anything to indicate otherwise.</p><p>But that wouldn\u2019t stop Emma. Her next step was likely to be the human police, and that was the worst possible outcome for everyone involved, including Emma herself.</p><p>So, Duncan had to talk to her tonight.</p><p>He drew a deep breath, burying his rage and papering over his more aggressive instincts. It didn\u2019t have to last long, no more than an hour or so. Long enough to settle Emma, then return to the D.C. house to sleep. And when he woke tomorrow night, he\u2019d carve out some time in the gym to work off the worst of his anger.</p><p>The house door cracked open silently as he and Miguel started up the walk. There were no lights on inside. Baldwin\u2019s silhouette was a short, square block of darker shadow as he stood there, holding the door open.</p><p>\u201cAnything I need to know?\u201d Duncan asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin Ari in the truck, then. You, too, Miguel.\u201d</p><p>Miguel stiffened immediately, his mouth open to protest, but Duncan just looked at him. His lieutenant scowled, but he gave a sharp nod and followed Baldwin back to the truck.</p><p>Duncan sighed in relief. It would be hard enough to maintain his composure with Emma tonight. He didn\u2019t need the additional aggravation of his vampires\u2019 emotions beating at his shields. They didn\u2019t have his sensitivity to the nightmare of that house, but they had picked up enough of it that their instinct was to close the circle around him. Which left him at the very center of their storm of outrage.</p><p>He needed this small space of time alone, without his vampires hovering, to restore his own calm center before talking to Emma. He crossed into the living room, circling the ancient couch. Emma lay on her side, beneath a crocheted blanket that Baldwin must have thrown over her. She was curled into a protective ball, knees drawn to her chest, arms held tightly in front, hands fisted as if against the blow that was coming.</p><p>He sat down next to her, and the couch sagged beneath his weight. She couldn\u2019t be comfortable sleeping here. Maybe he should take her upstairs first. He smiled slightly, recognizing the thought for what it was\u2014a way to delay the inevitable.</p><p>Her dark hair had fallen forward, covering half her face. He brushed it away and whispered, \u201cEmma.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelashes fluttered, dark against her fair skin, and her breathing became less regular. Duncan ran the backs of his fingers down her silky cheek. \u201cWake up, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>Emma felt Duncan\u2019s presence before she heard his voice. She thought it must be a dream, but it felt real. It felt like Duncan always did, a blanket of calm that was the opposite of how most people seemed to put everyone on edge, at least at first.</p><p>Whatever it was, she knew she had to wake up because there was something she needed to remember. Something about why Duncan was here.</p><p>\u201cEmma.\u201d His voice penetrated her sleep, urging her to wake. But suddenly she didn\u2019t want to wake up anymore. It was nice in her dream. Safe. And there was something awful waiting for her when she woke up.</p><p>His hand stroked her cheek. \u201cWake up, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>The last vestiges of sleep fled before the unexpected use of her real name, and she moaned softly. She tried to roll over, to turn away from him, but Duncan wouldn\u2019t let her. His strong hand on her shoulder held her in place, gentle but unyielding.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re awake, Emma.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s eyes flashed open. She stared at Duncan, barely able to see him in the dim light.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to turn on a light?\u201d he asked. He always seemed to know what she was thinking. He said it was skill at reading faces, but she wondered if it was something more.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice rough with sleep. She knew why he was here. It was about Lacey. And she wanted the darkness. She sat up. She was still wearing Duncan\u2019s jacket, and she pulled it around herself as she pushed her grandmama\u2019s afghan down to the foot of the couch. She didn\u2019t remember coming home, didn\u2019t remember falling asleep.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some water?\u201d Duncan asked. He was sitting on the side of the couch, and she swiveled around him to sit up, dropping her feet to the floor.</p><p>She leaned forward, hugging herself, and shook her head. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She heard him sigh as he moved from the couch to sit on the sturdy old coffee table she and Lacey had rescued from the curb when they first moved to this house. Someone two blocks over had put it out for the trash, but Lacey had seen it on her way home and dragged Emma back with her to pick it up. The damn thing was so heavy that they\u2019d struggled to force it even halfway into Emma\u2019s trunk, and then they\u2019d barely gotten it up the stairs into the house. The two of them had been grunting like rooting pigs, stopping every five minutes to rest. She smiled at the memory, and was horrified to feel tears burning the backs of her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma bit her lip as she fought for control. She wasn\u2019t going to cry. Tears wouldn\u2019t bring Lacey back. Nothing would. Emma\u2019s job now was to see Lacey properly buried. Then she\u2019d find whoever had done this . . . and kill him. She had a gun and she knew how to use it. You didn\u2019t grow up where she had and not learn how to shoot. She even had a membership at a shooting range in Virginia. No sense having a gun if you couldn\u2019t hit anything with it. She didn\u2019t get out to the range as often as she would have liked, but her aim was good enough. And up close and personal, it wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Either way, Emma wasn\u2019t going to wait for the police. Police were too easily bought off in this town. Besides, if they\u2019d taken her more seriously when she reported Lacey missing, maybe her best friend wouldn\u2019t be dead right now. Who knew how long she\u2019d been buried in that\u2014</p><p>But, she wasn\u2019t going to think about that. She was going to hold it together long enough to convince Duncan she was okay, and then the killer had better start looking over his shoulder, because she was going to make someone pay.</p> <p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Duncan said softly.</p><p>Emma raised her eyes to his. He looked worried, but there was no need. She was fine. Finer than fine. She was cold purpose.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d she said, proud of how even her voice was, how calm. Duncan appreciated calm. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s watchful gaze seemed to freeze, and for a moment Emma thought she saw a deep bronze glow replace the warm brown of his eyes. In that moment, she was convinced he knew what she was doing, what she planned to do tomorrow and the next day. But then he blinked, and she persuaded herself it was impossible. A figment of her always vivid imagination.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Emma.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re very kind,\u201d she said, drawing on Grandmama\u2019s teachings. A platitude for every occasion. Anything to cover up what you\u2019re really feeling, so no one ever has to suffer the embarrassment of a genuine emotion.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes narrowed into a scowl. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop shutting me out with your proper Southern manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire lord, Emma. You can\u2019t fool me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d she shot back. \u201cI\u2019m a human, and I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d Who the hell did he think he was anyway? If she wanted to pretend her heart wasn\u2019t breaking, if she needed to believe it, who was he to tell her she couldn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He stood, shoving the heavy table out of his way as if it weighed nothing at all. He turned his back, ignoring her for a moment. She could tell he was angry and trying to control it. Some men would have slammed a fist into a wall, or maybe thrown something. Duncan was too controlled for that, but there were still signs. He wasn\u2019t the only one who could read body language. She and Lacey had survived seven years in foster care. She was a damn expert at reading body language.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things you need to know,\u201d he said finally, but without turning.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lacey\u2019s body?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>That brought him around to stare at her. At first she thought he wouldn\u2019t answer her question, but then he said, \u201cAt a funeral home in Falls Church.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy there? Won\u2019t the police\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any police.\u201d</p><p>Emma stood, abruptly just as angry as he\u2019d been a moment ago. Forget that she\u2019d been planning to shut out the police and pursue her own revenge. She wasn\u2019t going to let him cover this up and pretend nothing had happened.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean no police?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou and your vampires murdered Lacey. The police will make Victor come back and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Emma froze, suddenly confused. \u201cBut, how? I mean, when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour nights ago.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, counting back. \u201cBut that means the first night I came to see you at the embassy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a fucking embassy,\u201d he snarled, \u201cand yes, he was already dead. That\u2019s how it works with vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow what works?\u201d she insisted, not at all put off by his mood. She wanted answers.</p><p>He started to respond, then caught himself and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that vampires were involved in this crime, and vampires will take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she persisted, feeling like snarling herself. \u201cSo Victor\u2019s dead. Great, fantastic. That\u2019s one down\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive down,\u201d he interjected. \u201cHe had bodyguards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive then,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t care. If they had anything to do with Lacey\u2019s\u2014\u201d She choked on the word, and had to force herself to keep going, stoking the flame of her anger to keep moving forward, to get it done. \u201c\u2014with Lacey\u2019s death,\u201d she continued calmly, \u201cthen they deserved to die. But they weren\u2019t the only ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. They weren\u2019t. But I know who was, and I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Emma gazed at him, struck dumb for the first time. He already knew who killed Lacey?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it, Emma. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be in on whatever you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin defiantly. \u201cThink again, vampire. You don\u2019t want me to go to the police? Then I want on the inside. You give me what I want, you get what you want.\u201d</p><p>Duncan was suddenly right in front of her, towering over her, crowding her with his sheer size and strength. That cool reserve of his was gone, and in its place was something ice cold and deadly, and absolutely lethal. This was the real Duncan, the vampire powerful enough to command others, and she knew instinctively that he could kill her with a thought.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I want,\u201d he said deliberately. \u201cBe very careful, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. Her heart was tripping so wildly it was climbing up her throat. \u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, then steeled her courage and glared back at him. \u201cBut I still want in.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a few seconds longer, and then a tiny smile curved his lips upward, there and gone almost before she could see it.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Emma couldn\u2019t have been more shocked. He was agreeing?</p><p>\u201cYou have a deal,\u201d Duncan continued smoothly. \u201cI\u2019ll expect you at the embassy, as you call it, one hour after sunset every night until this is finished. And I\u2019ll expect you to work just like the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, her thoughts stumbling as she tried to switch gears. He was going to help her find Lacey\u2019s killer. Or rather she was going to help him, but what mattered was that he could do it much faster than she could alone. And once he pointed her in the right direction, she\u2019d take matters into her own hands. After all, vampires slept all day long. There\u2019d be nothing he could do to stop her.</p><p>Duncan was studying her closely, and she quickly blanked her thoughts, busying her mind with efforts to remember when the sun went down and how she could convince Sharon to let her leave work early every day for a while.</p><p>\u201cWhen do we start?\u201d she asked</p><p>Duncan\u2019s gaze softened. \u201cTake a few days. Bury your friend. The men we want, the ones responsible, won\u2019t know that we found Lacey\u2019s body. There\u2019s no reason for them to be suspicious, no reason for them to run. And even if they do, I\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p><p>Emma stared up at him, believing him, knowing he would help her get justice for Lacey.</p><p>Lacey. Grief swelled inside her without warning. She wanted to be alone. She needed to be alone, to bury her face in a pillow and keen the pain of her loss where no one could hear it. Duncan\u2019s face blurred, and she blinked away her sudden tears. There was one last thing she needed to know.</p><p>\u201cCould you give me the name of the funeral home, please? I need to make arrangements for my Lacey.\u201d</p><p>Duncan closed the door behind him, listening as Miguel and the others settled down for the day. Doors slammed and voices quieted until there was only silence. He stripped off his clothes, letting them fall to the floor. They held a reek of death that would never come out. He\u2019d have them burned with the trash tomorrow.</p><p>Crossing the room, he checked the windows automatically, making certain the blinds were drawn, the heavy drapes closed tightly. He was tired tonight, both body and mind anguished by the atrocities he\u2019d uncovered, but even more by the weight of Emma\u2019s grief. It had touched a place in his soul, an old wound that was so scarred over it was barely there anymore. It was that gut-wrenching loss of someone so dear, someone you\u2019d have gladly given your life for. A pain he\u2019d buried so long ago, he\u2019d persuaded himself it was truly gone.</p><p>But Emma\u2019s grief had brought it all back . . .</p><p>1862, Stones River, Tennessee</p><p>He lay in the mud, listening to the screams of the men dying all around him, and the soft moans of the ones too far gone to scream. The sun had set some minutes ago, though it seemed much longer than that. He\u2019d watched the red glow on the horizon, and wondered how much of that color was the sun and how much a mist of blood from the day\u2019s brutal fighting. God knew there\u2019d been enough blood spilled today to color a thousand sunsets. His only consolation was the knowledge that the dying had been on both sides of the battle line, and that was small consolation indeed. More comforting was the certainty that at least his fighting was over.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t screaming, not yet, but he feared he would be before long. He lifted his hands, daring to look down at the blood-soaked tatters of his filthy uniform, and groaned at what he saw. He was no surgeon, but he\u2019d seen enough slaughtered animals to know what he was looking at. He\u2019d been gutted as surely as a pig in summer. His skin was sliced open, his intestines bulging outward in great loops of gray, grayer than the uniform he\u2019d been given only weeks before. The coat had come from a dead soldier, someone he\u2019d never known. He\u2019d shivered when they\u2019d handed it to him, wanting no part of a dead man\u2019s clothes. But these were troubled times. If you rejected the gray, no matter the reason, people looked on you with suspicion in these parts. This was Tennessee where there were nearly as many for the Confederacy as not, and it didn\u2019t matter what you said. It mattered what you did. So Duncan had taken the gray jacket and shrugged it on, feeling as if death itself was settling into his bones. And he hadn\u2019t been far wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lowered his hands over his belly once again, ignoring the slimy push of his guts against his fingers. He wanted to howl to the heavens. Not with pain, although it felt like a hot poker had been stuck in his belly to be stirred around every once in a while. But that wasn\u2019t what made him angry enough to curse God, his generals, and all those other men in suits who sent farmers like him to fight. It was death itself that made him angry. Not that he feared it. He figured he\u2019d lived a good enough life that the heavenly reward the scriptures promised would be his eventually. It was what he was leaving behind that made him angry, the things left undone\u2014even though he knew some of those things were not Christian-like and would probably send him straight to hell. But even lying here on the edge of death, it would have been worth it. He\u2019d have given up heaven itself to revenge the wrongs done to those he loved.</p><p>He sighed and lay back in the mud, no longer caring about the filth or even the stench. It didn\u2019t seem so bad anymore, and he reckoned he\u2019d either gotten accustomed or his senses were dying. Either way, he didn\u2019t have it in him to care.</p><p>The soldier closest to him fell abruptly silent and Duncan closed his eyes in prayer for the man\u2019s soul. He only hoped there\u2019d be someone left to pray for him when the time came.</p> <p>A shadow darkened the moon\u2019s light behind his closed eyelids, and his heart kicked up a bit. Maybe this was it after all.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t hurt so bad, boy,\u201d a deep voice said, the accent one he\u2019d never heard before.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes flashed open and he stared at the man crouched over him. No one had spoken to him since the surgeon who\u2019d come by earlier, and he\u2019d only shaken his head sadly and moved on. Duncan didn\u2019t blame the man. No point in wasting skills on those who couldn\u2019t be saved. And that included Duncan and every other man whose guts were fouled. They\u2019d be picked up eventually by those tasked with collecting the dead and dying. But Duncan wasn\u2019t dead yet, so who was this stranger and what did he want?</p><p>The man raised his eyes, and Duncan wondered if maybe God had judged his final thoughts of vengeance and sentenced him to hell after all. Because this was no ordinary man. His eyes were the black of midnight, with an unholy silver gleam about their edges, as if something peered out from behind. And he was bigger than any man Duncan had ever seen before. Bigger than Duncan, and he was counted a big man.</p><p>The stranger smiled and his teeth were clean and white. \u201cI\u2019m not your Christian devil. And this isn\u2019t hell.\u201d He looked around with a frown. \u201cOr not the one you\u2019re thinking of anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan stared. \u201cHow do you know what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d he whispered, his mouth almost too dry to form the words.</p><p>\u201cI know many things,\u201d the stranger said, turning that black gaze on him once again. \u201cI know you don\u2019t have to die today.\u201d He studied Duncan intently. \u201cUnless you wish to.\u201d</p><p>Duncan felt a surge of hope, quickly followed by fear. He wanted to live, at least long enough to seek his vengeance, but what price would this devilish man demand of him? Men like this gave away nothing for free. But then, some things were worth any price.</p><p>\u201cI want to live,\u201d he said, taking a chance.</p><p>\u201cNo questions, no negotiation?\u201d the man mocked lightly. \u201cAre you so quick to deal with the devil, Duncan Milford?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d Duncan asked, swallowing hard.</p> <p>\u201cI told you. I know many things. But let us discuss our deal first. I will save your life tonight, but in exchange, I want your service.\u201d</p><p>Duncan blinked. Was the stranger a spy for the Union then? Did he think Duncan had some useable information? Because he surely did not. \u201cWhat sort of service?\u201d he asked, curious despite himself.</p><p>The man shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a traveler to this place. I need someone who knows local customs, even language. Though I thought I spoke it well enough before I got here,\u201d the man added in an aside.</p><p>Duncan examined the man\u2019s words. He actually spoke well enough, though perhaps a bit too well. The very correctness of his speech gave away his foreign roots, that and the accent which Duncan still couldn\u2019t place.</p><p>Duncan shifted, trying to ease the renewed pain in his gut. \u201cYou want me to\u2014\u201d He gasped as that hot poker started jabbing and stirring again. He fell quiet, willing it to be gone for a few more minutes. Closing his eyes, he tried to remember the faces of his children, pictured his son running to greet him at the end of a day. He smiled, but their faces began to fade as a wave of fresh agony seared his guts and blackness stole his memories along with his thoughts.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, he knew time had passed. \u201cHow long?\u201d he asked the stranger who knelt next to him in the mud. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough,\u201d the man growled. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>Duncan licked his dry lips, grimacing. There was a strange taste in his mouth. Not bad, better in fact that the bitter tang of bile which was all he\u2019d tasted since being wounded. He drew a cautious breath, not wanting to awaken the pain, and realized his gut hurt no more than a mild ache. He looked down in shock. His trousers were still torn and bloody, but his stomach was whole, the skin puckered with raw, red scars instead of split and spilling shiny gray intestine. Duncan stared, then looked up in sudden terror. This was surely unholy.</p> <p>The man made an impatient noise. \u201cEnough, Milford. I\u2019ve already told you, I\u2019m not the devil. Doesn\u2019t your God heal as well? Now, do you want my bargain or not? You live, and in return, you serve as my aide.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stared. \u201cBut you\u2019ve already healed me.\u201d</p><p>The man smiled gently. \u201cSo I have.\u201d</p><p>Well, this was vexing, Duncan thought. For this was no trick. The worst of the pain was gone. And not only the pain from the wound which would most certainly have killed him, but the ache in the leg he\u2019d broken as a child. The break had healed poorly and had pained him every day since. And yet, lying here in the mud and blood, he felt better than he could remember since childhood. And perhaps this was a gift from the heavens, for the stranger did not bear the likeness of any of the demons Duncan had seen in the good books, nor did he carry himself like one in the way the ministers warned of in their sermons. Even more, he gave no indication he would take back his healing if Duncan refused the bargain, which a servant of the devil surely would have done.</p><p>But at the same time, Duncan could not, in all good faith, refuse the bargain since the stranger had in truth healed him. Vexing indeed.</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>The man raised a fine brow in question.</p><p>\u201cHow long would I have to serve you?\u201d</p><p>The man shrugged. \u201cFor the rest of your life or mine,\u201d he said, and turned to survey the battlefield once again.</p><p>Duncan sighed. He\u2019d expected as much. Not that it mattered. He had nothing and no one to go home to anymore. He doubted his home was even there any longer.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cI agree to your bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing,\u201d the stranger said, turning toward Duncan with a wide grin.</p><p>Duncan froze beneath the sudden weight of that black gaze. His heart began to pound and his breathing became short, as if his body already knew something that his mind had not yet grasped. Some part of him knew he should be gibbering in fear, crawling on hands and knees, if that\u2019s what it took to flee this inhuman monster before him. Instead, he lay and stared, almost in wonder, as the man\u2019s grin grew fangs as long as any red wolf\u2019s, and as the silver light of his eyes began to glow like the stars themselves. Perhaps the stranger had bespelled him somehow, or perhaps he was dead after all, and this entire conversation was nothing but a dying fancy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d he heard himself ask.</p><p>\u201cI am Vampire,\u201d the man said. \u201cAnd if you choose to remain with me, you will be, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d Duncan said, amazed at his own calmness.</p><p>The man\u2014no, the vampire\u2014laughed. \u201cIt is a wondrous thing,\u201d he said, then lowered his head, staring intently at Duncan once more.</p><p>\u201cAre you . . . human?\u201d Duncan asked.</p><p>The vampire lifted one shoulder. \u201cI was born human. I still am, in a way. But becoming Vampire changes you. Makes you more of whatever you were. You will still be Duncan Milford, but you will be more, as well. Stronger, sharper, more powerful.\u201d</p><p>Duncan thought about that. \u201cCould I ask a boon of you?\u201d</p><p>The stranger seemed surprised by this, but he nodded. \u201cYou may ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I go with you, if I become this . . . vampire as you are, I would ask that you permit me one final task before we leave.\u201d</p><p>The vampire tilted his head in curiosity. \u201cWhat task is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVengeance,\u201d Duncan said softly.</p><p>The silver in the vampire\u2019s eyes gleamed so brightly Duncan feared it would bring others running. \u201cDone,\u201d the vampire said. He stood and offered his hand.</p><p>Duncan grasped it and felt himself pulled to his feet as if he weighed nothing at all. \u201cWhat do you I call you, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d the vampire said. \u201cMy name is Raphael.\u201d He stepped back and made a sweeping gesture. \u201cLead the way, Duncan Milford. Your vengeance awaits.\u201d</p><p>They walked most of the night. Duncan had worried at first about sentries, about being labeled a deserter or worse. But Raphael had assured him they would not be seen, and they weren\u2019t. Several times they passed within feet of a sentry, once walking past the command tent itself. And yet no one seemed aware they were even there. Animals were a different matter entirely. The horses sensed them, moving about and snorting restlessly when they slipped through the picket lines, but Raphael and Duncan were long gone before anyone came to check the animals, assuming anyone had bothered.</p><p>As they walked, Raphael told Duncan something of who he was, of what it meant to be Vampire.</p><p>\u201cAs your Sire,\u201d Raphael said as they traveled down an abandoned country road, \u201cI will teach you how to survive, how to use whatever gifts the rebirth bestows upon you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRebirth?\u201dDuncan repeated.</p><p>The big vampire nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what we call it, for that\u2019s what it is. Everything you were before will change. You\u2019ll leave everyone you know behind, even family. Do you have family, Duncan?\u201d</p><p>A wave of grief swept over Duncan, nearly drowning him, and it was several steps before he could speak again. Raphael kept his silence, and Duncan was grateful for it. Finally, he said, \u201cI did once. No longer.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael said nothing at first, as if pondering the many ways a man could lose his family. \u201cThis vengeance you seek, it\u2019s for your family.\u201d He said it as fact, not in question, but Duncan answered anyway.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He swallowed the hard knot of loss clogging his throat. \u201cMy wife and children.\u201d</p><p>It was several minutes before Raphael spoke again. \u201cThat\u2019s a heavy burden for any man to bear.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded, then studied the vampire closely, wondering if he, too, had lost someone. \u201cDid you leave family behind, sir?\u201d</p><p>A fierce look crossed Raphael\u2019s face, and Duncan thought perhaps he\u2019d gone too far, presumed too much. He opened his mouth to apologize, but Raphael spoke first. \u201cMy parents,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cThough my father was no loss to me, I grieved for my mother. My sister, too, or so I thought for a time.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan was curious about that last bit, but decided against pressing his luck any further. \u201cYou said you\u2019re newly arrived in this country, sir? You picked a bad time for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn truth, we arrived a few years past. It\u2019s taken this long to get settled and decide to move west.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201dDuncan questioned somewhat nervously. \u201cThere\u2019s more of you?\u201d</p><p>Raphael must have heard the nerves. He grinned down at Duncan, his eyes going that strange silvery color again. \u201cIf you mean vampires, there\u2019s more than a few, though humans are largely unaware of us. My own group is small, just those I brought with me from the old country. You needn\u2019t worry, though. They\u2019re completely loyal to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I ask where they are, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop siring me, boy. If you must, my title\u2019s lord, for that\u2019s what I am, a vampire lord.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Duncan said dutifully, though it seemed odd to say it. There were no such titles in this country. The founders had left behind that sort of thing, but perhaps vampires were different. \u201cDo you have many land holdings, then, my lord?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>Raphael barked a laugh. \u201cAnd there you\u2019ve pricked my pride but good, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. You\u2019ve the right of it. I\u2019ve nothing but a few loyal men and a purse filled with coin. The men were carefully chosen, and the coin comes easily. For the rest of it, be assured, Duncan Milford, I will rule an empire before I\u2019m through.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded in agreement, and the two of them continued for some time without speaking. The moon had set and the night had begun to take on the stillness that precedes the dawn, when Raphael verged suddenly from the road, heading deep into the trees. Duncan followed, not knowing what else to do. He\u2019d chosen the route they were taking back to his home, but they had many miles to go yet, and he wasn\u2019t familiar with the lands they were passing through. Raphael seemed to know where he was going, however, weaving his way through the thick forest until they reached a small hut. Hidden beneath some low-hanging branches, it was a rough-built structure of unfinished logs and mud, but it looked sturdy enough and was most likely used by hunters in summer. Since it was winter now, the place was empty as far as Duncan could tell, and the sturdy lock on the door didn\u2019t invite visitors. But Raphael didn\u2019t hesitate. He walked right up and twisted the thick metal lock as if it were paper, then tossed it aside.</p><p>Duncan stared from the now useless padlock to Raphael and back again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do the same soon enough,\u201d Raphael assured him, then pushed the door open and stepped inside. Duncan followed more slowly and found Raphael giving the place a critical survey. \u201cI\u2019ve slept in better,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd worse. This will do.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly, then opened them and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve just enough time. Have a seat, Duncan.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait, but dropped to the floor, pressing his back up against the wall.</p> <p>Duncan shrugged and sat beside him, wondering what was coming next.</p><p>\u201cThere are things we must discuss before going forward,\u201d Raphael began. \u201cI was made Vampire unwilling, or at least unknowing. No one inquired as to whether I wanted it or not, but I tell you this, I do not regret it. It is an incomparable gift. I have lived nearly three hundred years, Duncan. I have power that you would not believe if I told you, but that you will understand when you join us. There are many things you will have to learn about being Vampire, but the most important is this. In order to survive, you will need to drink human blood.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes widened in horror.\u201cMy lord! I have fought in war, as you well know, but I\u2019ve no desire to survive by killing innocents!\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head. \u201cIt is not necessary to kill the humans you choose to drink from, Duncan. Moreover, once you become Vampire, your bite itself will become enjoyable to them. Some will actually invite you to drink their blood in exchange for this pleasure, though there will be times you will have to take what you need. But you will never have to kill for it.\u201d</p><p>Duncan looked away, mulling over what he\u2019d just heard. This certainly cast a fresh light on the decision he\u2019d made. Could he do this? Could he bite another human being and drink his blood?</p><p>\u201cAgain, I will not make you Vampire without your willing consent, Duncan. You may still, with my blessing, consider the healing a gift and return to whatever waits for you. Or you can go forward with me and the others. The choice is yours, but you must make it now.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stared through the same empty doorway Raphael had, seeking his own past and his future . . . and found nothing at all. His past had been stolen when his family was killed, and his future had died along with them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it, my lord,\u201d he whispered, then repeated more strongly, \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we must begin, for the sun is not far off. An important lesson, Duncan. The sun is our enemy. It traps us in slumber through the day, and if we are exposed to its light, we will burn unto ash if left there. It is perhaps our greatest vulnerability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we be killed otherwise, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cA stake through the heart, or a sword, if wielded properly. Fire, if the damage is too great to be healed. And no one, not even a vampire, can survive having his head removed.\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed nervously. \u201cGood to know, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael clapped him on the shoulder, then stood and looked around. \u201cLie over there,\u201d he said</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201dDuncan asked, looking up at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d Raphael repeated. \u201cIt will be easier for both of us.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s heart stuttered a bit, despite his earlier words. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Duncan,\u201d Raphael said gently.</p><p>Duncan rose to his feet. It was nearly too dark to see, but he could make out a lone cot against the far wall. It was little more than a wood frame and slats, not even a straw mattress. Whoever used the place in summer would have known better than to leave such a thing behind. It would have been crawling with vermin by the next season. He shuffled over to the cot, then reached down with one hand, putting weight on the slats to test their sturdiness. They gave a bit, but held, so he lowered himself down, thinking even this was better than the cold ground he\u2019d slept on for the weeks since he\u2019d been swept up by General Bragg\u2019s march through Tennessee. He let out a weary breath and thought he could probably sleep, except\u2014</p><p>\u201cComfortable, Duncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, yes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael loomed over him in the dark. \u201cI\u2019m going to bite you,\u201d he said as he knelt next to the cot. \u201cOn the neck, because it\u2019s fastest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly at first,\u201d Raphael said with surprising honesty. \u201cBut after that, you\u2019ll experience the pleasure of a vampire\u2019s bite for the first and last time. Vampires cannot feed from each other, nor does their bite have the same effect as on a human.\u201d</p><p>Raphael turned Duncan\u2019s head firmly to one side and held him there. His breath was hot as he drew closer, and Duncan\u2019s heart kicked furiously in his chest. There was the touch of something hard and pointed, and then a pain as sharp as a knife slicing into his neck. He had one moment to think perhaps he\u2019d been played for a fool, and then his blood heated and his body stiffened in a way it hadn\u2019t in the months since his wife died. Some small part of his brain was telling him this was wrong, but it didn\u2019t feel wrong. It felt . . . wondrous! And then he felt nothing at all.</p><p>When Duncan woke, he lay still for a moment, listening, astonished at the multitude of sounds all around him. He turned his head at a scratching noise and knew there was a mouse scurrying along the wall, though he couldn\u2019t see it. Outside, an owl swooped overhead, its wings a hard flutter of sound. Duncan smiled. It was as if he\u2019d lived in only half the world until now, with the other half beyond his pitiful senses. But no longer.</p><p>He stretched, feeling strong and limber, marveling again at the lack of pain or soreness. His grin stretched wider, and he wanted to throw his head back and laugh with a joy he hadn\u2019t felt in years.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d Raphael ducked as he stepped through the doorway, and Duncan realized it was still night. Or was it?</p><p>\u201cHow long did I sleep?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust the one day,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cYou\u2019ll sleep later into darkness than some of us at first, but my blood is powerful, and your strength will build up fast enough. After that, it\u2019s up to you. No one can predict what gifts Vampire will bestow. We have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is gift enough,\u201d Duncan said enthusiastically. He stood, testing his legs one at a time, twisting from side to side, and gave in to the urge to laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raphael grinned back at him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get going. There\u2019s your vengeance to see to, and then we must rejoin the others.\u201d</p><p>Vengeance, Duncan thought. He straightened and faced his new master. \u201cI\u2019m ready, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Washington, D.C., present day</p> <p>Vengeance. It was the first thought Duncan had as he woke the next night. He couldn\u2019t bring Lacey back for Emma, couldn\u2019t take away the pain of her death. But he could bring vengeance against those who had wronged her.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Falls Church, VA</p><p>Emma sat perfectly straight, hands folded together in her lap. It had taken two days to get everything ready. Two days to arrange a proper farewell for the only person in the world who\u2019d really mattered to her. The funeral director had been very kind, but there were so many decisions to make, things she\u2019d never have thought of on her own.</p><p>But despite the rush, despite the stress of arranging the funeral so quickly, it was all beautiful. And perfectly Lacey. The music, the flowers, even the casket with its bronze embellishments and beautiful mahogany wood.</p> <p>The soft swell of some of Lacey\u2019s favorite music muted the murmur of whispered conversations all around her. It had been difficult to find the right songs for tonight. Lacey had always been a rock and roll kind of girl, her music better suited to roaring down the highway with the windows open and music blasting.</p><p>Emma smiled sadly at the memory, and smoothed her skirt with nervous fingers. She\u2019d worn her best black suit, her gray silk blouse, even the black Jimmy Choo pumps she\u2019d bought on a dare from Lacey and then never worn, because they were too nice for work. And since Emma never went anywhere except work, they\u2019d sat in her closet, still in the box, never worn until tonight. Lacey would have loved that the Jimmy Choos had been broken out for her funeral.</p><p>Emma closed her eyes, unable to bear the sight of the casket any longer. She\u2019d half expected Duncan to show up, but she was glad he hadn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t think she could deal with any vampires right now. Even knowing it wasn\u2019t his fault, that blaming him for what Victor had done would be like blaming the guy next door for what someone across town had done. She still wasn\u2019t ready to face him. Not yet.</p><p>The burial wasn\u2019t until tomorrow; that would be private, just between her and Lacey. But Lacey had so many friends, and they\u2019d all called Emma, wanting to participate somehow, to say good-bye. So, the funeral director had suggested this memorial. He\u2019d called it a viewing, but Emma had refused to permit an open casket. Lacey would have hated that.</p><p>Emma had arrived early and stood by the door at first, shaking hands, staring at faces she didn\u2019t know as they said all the right things. They were Lacey\u2019s friends, not hers. Lacey had always been so much more social than Emma. She\u2019d made friends so easily.</p><p>And one of those friends had helped kill her. Actually, probably more than one, from what Duncan had said.</p> <p>But the people here tonight didn\u2019t know that. They all thought it was an accident. That Lacey had lost control of her car and spun off the road on her way to visit someone back home. Of course, Lacey didn\u2019t have anyone back home. There was no back home. But these people didn\u2019t know that either.</p><p>Emma opened her eyes and stared straight ahead, sitting on the bench in the front row where she\u2019d taken refuge, unable to cope with anymore well-meaning strangers. She couldn\u2019t take one more understanding smile, one more delicately dabbed tear, not even one more gentle handshake.</p><p>She wanted to die. She couldn\u2019t imagine living with this pain, this horrible emptiness. Lacey was gone, and Emma was left horribly, impossibly alone. The weight of her grief bent her back until she was bowed in half, until she thought it would crush her. She\u2019d lost before\u2014her grandmother, her mother, even the father she\u2019d never known.</p><p>But Lacey wasn\u2019t supposed to die. Not Lacey. Emma studied; Emma worked. But Lacey lived. It never mattered where they found themselves or how little money they had, Lacey had always found something to celebrate, to laugh about, to dance for. She was the sister Emma had never had, the only friend she\u2019d ever needed, her family.</p><p>And she was gone.</p><p>Emma closed her eyes again, afraid if she moved, if she so much as blinked an eyelid, she\u2019d fall apart, scattering into tiny pieces that no longer knew how to put themselves together. How could there be an Emma with no Lacey to make her whole? She choked back a sob and wondered if this night would ever end.</p><p>She knew the moment he arrived. Felt the warm blanket of comfort reach out to her frozen soul, felt the safety of his presence long before he made his way down the aisle to sit next to her. He didn\u2019t reach out, didn\u2019t touch her. It was almost as if he, too, knew she might shatter and disappear.</p><p>A single tear slid out from under her closed eyelids, and she reached blindly for his hand. He took her hand and more, gathering her close, his arms coming around her warm and strong as her head sank onto his shoulder, as her tears finally came, soaking the wool of his fine suit.</p> <p>He whispered meaningless words as she cried, holding her together as she shuddered with grief. He was an island of calm in a world she didn\u2019t understand anymore.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say how long they sat there. She\u2019d long ago stopped crying; her body had no more moisture left for tears. Finally, she lifted her head, brushing aside her tangled hair. She should have been embarrassed, but she wasn\u2019t. He offered her a perfect, white handkerchief. She stared at it, then raised her eyes to his. Who carried a handkerchief anymore?</p><p>He looked back at her. \u201cI\u2019m old-fashioned,\u201d he explained, seeming to know what she was thinking, as always. But for some reason, the idea no longer bothered her. It was simply who he was. He was Duncan, and vampire or not, he was a very good man.</p><p>He kissed her forehead, his lips warm and firm. \u201cThey\u2019ll pay, Emma,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI promise you.\u201d</p><p>Others had offered sympathy, had told her what a great person Lacey had been, how much she\u2019d be missed.</p><p>Only Duncan had offered her the one thing she needed. Vengeance.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Emma unlocked her front door and pushed inside. It was dark. She still hadn\u2019t remembered to leave a light on, still expected Lacey to be home first. She sighed and started across the room to the light switch, but Miguel beat her to it.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She ducked her head, a little embarrassed at his kindness after she\u2019d thought such terrible things about him.</p><p>Duncan lifted his chin in the direction of the door, and Miguel left, pulling the door closed behind him, although Emma was sure he wouldn\u2019t go far. He might no longer believe that she had dastardly plans for Duncan, but he didn\u2019t completely trust her either. Or maybe it was like Duncan said; he just didn\u2019t trust anyone. That was something she could understand.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Duncan said with barely controlled impatience. \u201cI want you to come home with us. You shouldn\u2019t stay here alone.\u201d</p><p>Emma turned to him with a rueful smile. He\u2019d made the same argument to her all the way home, but her answer hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that, Duncan. Honest. But . . .\u201d She gazed around the softly lit room. It looked so inviting, comfy almost. She and Lacey had thought themselves incredibly lucky to have found this place and they\u2019d been happy here. But Emma knew she\u2019d be moving as soon as possible. There was no way she could stay in this house with Lacey gone.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI have to get up early tomorrow. There\u2019s so much to do, and the burial\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, reschedule the burial for tomorrow night, and I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d He cupped her cheek in one hand and lifted the other to brush a lock of hair from her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do this alone.\u201d</p><p>That was the rest of the argument he\u2019d made on the drive from the funeral home. Actually argument wasn\u2019t even the right word. He\u2019d simply told her how it was going to be. Or he\u2019d tried to, at least. Emma had a feeling Duncan wasn\u2019t used to being told no. But he was going to hear it this time. Because burying Lacey was something she did need to do alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said gently, \u201cbut no. I\u2019m going to say good-bye to Lacey in my own way. Then I need to go to work. I haven\u2019t been there since\u2014\u201d She broke off, not knowing what words to use to describe the events of Lacey\u2019s death. She shut her eyes as a newly familiar pain squeezed her heart. Would the day ever come when she wouldn\u2019t feel this terrible ache at the thought of her murdered friend? Would she someday be able to remember the joy they\u2019d shared without being forced to remember how it all ended?</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to the office in a few days,\u201d she amended, meeting Duncan\u2019s narrowed gaze. \u201cI need to find out when they expect me back, and make some excuse for leaving early so I can work with you every night until we find Lacey\u2019s killer.\u201d She linked her fingers with his and held on tightly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed your mind, have you? You\u2019re still going to let me help?\u201d</p><p>Duncan tilted his head in assent. \u201cI keep my promises, Emma. All of them.\u201d</p><p>Emma blew out a relieved breath. \u201cI\u2019m counting on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t change your mind and come home with us\u2014reschedule the burial.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a lopsided smile. \u201cNo. But I\u2019ll come to the embassy, I mean the house, tomorrow night, and I\u2019ll be ready to work.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, clearly unhappy, but then gave a minimal shrug that was more an expression than a movement on his part. \u201cAs you wish. I\u2019ll expect you tomorrow evening, then. One hour after sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there, boss.\u201d</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t smile. He was staring at her intently, his eyes flaring with emotion. Emma leaned closer, drawn to his raw power, to the danger concealed beneath that civilized exterior. His gaze skimmed her face, settling on her mouth, and she surrendered to the sudden, burning need to lick her lips. He took a half step forward, and her heart began to pound. His big hand curved over her hip possessively, tugging her closer still, as he lowered his head. And Emma forgot how to breathe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth touched hers in a chaste kiss, his lips warm and surprisingly soft. Emma opened her mouth, wanting more, wanting to taste him. Her tongue slid along the seam of his lips, and Duncan\u2019s fingers dug into her hip, pulling her flush against his body as he lifted his other hand and threaded his fingers through her hair.</p><p>His body was hard, her breasts crushed against his chest as she tilted her head back, opening her mouth in invitation. Duncan responded with a low growl, deepening the kiss, his tongue delving into her mouth, twisting around her tongue, sending shivers of desire racing through her body. She lifted up onto her toes, wanting more, curling her arms around his neck with a hungry moan.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s arms tightened around her, and she felt the unmistakable press of an erection against her belly, a long, thick column of hard flesh that made liquid heat swell between her legs. Sudden images of Duncan naked, gleaming with sweat, his arms corded with muscle as he rose above her, his hips pumping\u2014</p> <p>Duncan broke the kiss with a groan, his breath hot against her neck as he held her close, his hands flexing against her back.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he gasped warningly, breathing hard.</p><p>Emma heard him, but she didn\u2019t answer, couldn\u2019t find the breath to answer. He was trying to protect her, she knew. Trying to be sensible, to be sensitive. But Emma didn\u2019t want sensible. She wanted to lose herself in the heat and passion that was buried beneath that cool, Duncan exterior. Wanted to warm herself at the fire that he kept so carefully banked and hidden from view.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he repeated, more softly this time.</p><p>She sighed regretfully, knowing he was right. He eased away from her enough that their bodies were no longer touching.</p> <p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be one?\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s brown eyes heated, glowing with that same bronze fire before he brushed her ear with his lips. \u201cThere will be a time, Emmaline,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd when the time comes, the place will no longer matter.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and kissed her lips one more time, a gentle touch there and gone.</p><p>\u201cSleep well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you need anything, call. I have people on staff around the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, already missing him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan\u2019s arm snaked around her waist, pulling her close, his head dipping until she felt his lips on her neck. She gasped at the hard scrape of his teeth\u2014his fangs!\u2014against her skin. He breathed deeply, as if inhaling her scent, then lifted his head with a growl.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone, leaving the door rattling in its frame.</p><p>Emma stood in the dim light of her foyer, heart thumping as she raised shaking fingers to her neck, feeling the heat of her skin where his lips had touched her. She hugged herself, wondering what it would be like to make love to a vampire, to feel the scrape of his fangs against her tongue or . . . she shivered remembering the brush of his mouth against her neck. And she knew it wasn\u2019t fear making her shiver.</p><p>She chided her overactive imagination. She was overloaded emotionally, that\u2019s all this was. She was drained and exhausted, and Duncan had been there to hold her when she needed it. He\u2019d been so kind, the perfect gentleman, and she\u2019d all but assaulted him when he\u2019d tried to help her, to comfort her. And, okay, he\u2019d been interested, but only because she\u2019d thrown herself at him, rubbing herself against him . . . She nearly groaned aloud, remembering the feel of his cock against her belly, the heat in his eyes.</p><p>She squeezed her suddenly aching breasts, rubbing the flat of her palms over her nipples, gasping with pleasure as she sank to the stairs. She was in so much trouble.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Duncan stormed into his office, furious with himself, with the entire situation. He hadn\u2019t wanted to leave Emma alone, despite her insistence. But he certainly hadn\u2019t helped matters when he\u2019d all but attacked her. It had taken all his considerable will power to break away from her seductive warmth. What he\u2019d wanted to do was to push her against the wall, shove that tight skirt up to her waist, and take her right where she stood. She\u2019d been ready for him, her breasts swollen, her nipples so hard he\u2019d felt them against his chest despite the layers of clothing between them. And her scent! God, the sweet scent of her had driven him mad with desire.</p> <p>Thankfully, he\u2019d come to his senses in time. By all that was holy, the woman was in mourning, emotionally vulnerable, her feelings raw and wide open. Only an animal would take advantage of her in that state.</p><p>He unbuttoned his suit jacket and yanked his tie loose, disgusted. Despite all of that, he still wished she\u2019d come home with him. He was worried about her. Whoever had killed Lacey would be desperate to make certain no one ever found out about it, and they\u2019d be nervous once word got around that Victor had left town. At least that was the story Duncan and his people had put out about the late vampire lord, that he\u2019d been called away without warning.</p><p>And that was a timely reminder for Duncan, too. Instead of seducing vulnerable young women, he should be taking up his duties as representative of vampire interests in the capital. Those duties included figuring out what Victor had been up to, but there was more to it than that. He had to become part of the Washington social and diplomatic circuit. He grimaced with distaste at the thought, but there was no alternative. Before he took that up, however, he had to make arrangements for Emma\u2019s safety.</p><p>Miguel strolled through the doorway, having delayed downstairs to double check the daytime guard deployment. The routine here was still new enough that it didn\u2019t hurt to be sure everyone knew their assignments.</p><p>\u201cSet a guard on Emma Duquet,\u201d Duncan told his lieutenant without preamble. \u201cDay and night. I don\u2019t want one of Victor\u2019s former clients getting nervous and going after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Miguel made a quick call on his cell and it was done. They\u2019d let go the security company Victor had employed, and replaced it with the men and women Miguel had trained personally for this job. Duncan trusted these humans with his life\u2014quite literally until they got the basement vault constructed and functional.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Alaric progressing downstairs?\u201d Duncan asked.</p><p>\u201cExcellent, my lord, but, as he keeps telling me, he has to rebuild this ancient and rotting foundation before he can add anything to it.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThe old man loves a challenge.\u201d</p><p>Duncan pulled off his jacket, throwing it on a chair as he settled behind the desk of his new second floor office\u2014an office which looked very much like the library downstairs, and for a good reason. While it had been necessary for Duncan to move away from the library\u2014for security reasons, if nothing else\u2014he\u2019d liked the ambience of the old room\u2014the books, the furniture, even the wainscoting. So Alaric\u2019s crew had moved everything up here. It was quite remarkable, really. Every book, shelf, table and lamp had been moved. Now if they could just provide him with a decent place to sleep. And a gym.</p><p>\u201cHow are we doing on the videos from Leesburg?\u201d Duncan asked. He refused to refer to the house itself anymore. He wouldn\u2019t rest until it burned to the ground.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still no video of Lacey Cray, my lord. Not there, and not on any of the ones we discovered here, even though she\u2019s in Victor\u2019s files and, according to Ms. Duquet, was a regular at Victor\u2019s parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t delete her from his files altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably would have eventually. He expected to be around a lot longer than he was.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded in satisfaction. That much at least had gone right. Victor was gone, and Duncan had been the one to destroy him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still plenty of incriminating video, my lord,\u201d Miguel said. \u201cEnough to destroy more than one political career, even if the men involved could prove it was consensual. Victor hedged his bets, and I\u2019m sure he made sure they knew about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept there are no faces on the video. All we have are Victor\u2019s files, and even those don\u2019t name names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhoebe\u2019s working on that. We can probably get some IDs by combining what we do have\u2014the video and Victor\u2019s paper files\u2014with what Brendan and Erik and their friends know. They talked to some of the men involved, after all. We can at least identify those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated with them. The men are public figures for the most part. The women . . . who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma can help with that tomorrow night. Even if she doesn\u2019t know the names, she may be able to tell us possible workplaces, or even other people to check with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s time I introduced myself to those powerful circles of Victor\u2019s, too. Something casual where I can talk to people.\u201d Duncan thought for a moment. \u201cCheck Victor\u2019s calendar. See if there\u2019s anything already scheduled. If so, have someone contact the organizers. Give them the line we agreed on, Victor\u2019s been called away and I\u2019m the new ambassador.\u201d</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t like to use the pretentious title, but apparently he\u2019d have to get used to it. \u201cIn the meantime,\u201d he continued, \u201ccontact every senator and congressman from Virginia, Maryland and Delaware. Let them know I\u2019m taking over and I\u2019d like to meet with them. See if they have any events coming up and get us invited. Fundraisers, especially. Make sure they know we\u2019re good for a donation. Maybe Emma can help with that, too. She works in a congressman\u2019s office, after all. She knows how all of this works.\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment while Miguel took feverish notes.</p><p>\u201cPut California\u2019s senators on the list, too,\u201d he added. \u201cI voted there last election, and Raphael\u2019s a big contributor. Which reminds me, we need to establish a legal residence for me outside the District, so I can vote in my own territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor owned a house in Annapolis,\u201d Miguel offered. \u201cI can send some people to check it out. If nothing else, you can use the address.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He frowned as he watched Miguel tap the information into his PDA. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need more people, Miguel. You\u2019re my lieutenant, not my admin, and this enormous house will need a housekeeper and staff, too. How did Victor handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans, my lord,\u201d Miguel replied, looking up with a disapproving scowl. \u201cHe had a crew in once a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we won\u2019t be doing that. Put the word out, you know the routine. Give preference to vampires within my territory, but anyone from outside who\u2019s willing to swear fealty in blood will be considered. Appoint someone to do the initial screening, but you or Louis handle the final selection personally. And I\u2019ll want to choose the housekeeper myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the photos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe composites from the videos. I\u2019d like to take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on your computer, my lord, along with Phoebe\u2019s preliminary report.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan swung his chair around to the computer, which sat on an L-shaped extension to the desk. Pulling up the relevant file, he scanned Phoebe\u2019s report quickly, then brought up the grainy images. Only the women were shown in full-face; the best Louis had managed of the men was the occasional partial profile. But profiles gave away more than people knew. That one, for example, had a very distinctive beak of a nose, and the next one a crude, almost primitive brow combined with the collapsed nasal bridge of someone whose nose has been broken too many times. It wasn\u2019t much, but he\u2019d remember these men. They might not know him when they met at a party or a fundraiser, but he\u2019d know them. Their emotions, even more than their words, would give them away. The only challenge would be waiting until the evening was over to rip out their throats.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Emma walked down the familiar hallway to Guy Coffer\u2019s congressional office. She passed a few people she knew and there was sympathy in their gazes. But there was a morbid curiosity, too, as if they feared\u2014or maybe hoped\u2014she\u2019d break down weeping right here in the hallowed halls. That wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>Oh, Emma still grieved. She would mourn Lacey every day for the rest of her life, but her grief was private, just as her final farewell this morning had been private. Mr. Pettry, the funeral director, had been there, but he\u2019d remained discreetly in the background. There\u2019d been no prayers, no stranger from the cemetery\u2019s list of convenient clergy to mumble a pro forma eulogy over a woman he\u2019d never known.</p><p>Just Emma and the two workers who\u2019d lowered Lacey\u2019s casket into the ground and then slowly, shovel by shovel, buried her.</p><p>Emma had stood there through the whole thing, her tears hot despite the icy drizzle which had begun to fall, freezing every inch of exposed skin. She\u2019d waited until the last shovel full of dirt had been thrown, the earth packed down again, and the neat squares of sod replaced. The two diggers had straightened then, glancing from her to the funeral director, accustomed, she supposed, to the irrational behavior of grieving families.</p> <p>Mr. Pettry had finally approached slowly, his footsteps crunching on grass that had already begun to ice over.</p><p>\u201cMs. Duquet?\u201d</p><p>Emma hunched her shoulders, knowing it was time. She nodded, and looked up at the two graveyard workers.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she told them.</p><p>They nodded solemnly and hurried off, eager, no doubt, to be out of this awful weather.</p><p>\u201cMay I walk you to your car?\u201d Mr. Pettry inquired, hinting gently that it was time for her to leave, as well.</p><p>Emma had forced a smile and taken his proffered arm, grateful for the support. She\u2019d worn the Jimmy Choo pumps again, and the heels were too high for the uneven grass.</p><p>She glanced down at the black pumps now, as she hurried along the marble floored hallway. She\u2019d been right after all, about not wearing them to work. If she made it to the office without twisting an ankle, she\u2019d count herself lucky. She probably should have followed her first instinct and buried the damn shoes with her friend, but Lacey never would have forgiven her. Lacey had taken her designers very seriously. Yet another reason she\u2019d never had the rent money.</p> <p>Emma sighed and wished she didn\u2019t have to go to the office at all today, but there were too many people eager for a job like hers. If she stayed out too long, Sharon Coffer might very well use it as an excuse to hire someone old and ugly, or at least male. And Emma needed the money. She couldn\u2019t afford to lose her job, especially now. The lease on the house she\u2019d shared with Lacey had two more months on it, and then there\u2019d be the expense of securing a new place and moving. Besides, if she went home, she\u2019d be surrounded by memories of Lacey. It was better to stay busy until tonight, when she could finally get down to the only thing that mattered to her . . . helping the vampires track down her friend\u2019s killer. And the irony of that last thought wasn\u2019t lost on her, since it was vampires who\u2019d been responsible for Lacey\u2019s death. It was like asking the fox to figure out who ate the chickens. But Duncan wasn\u2019t going to let the human police get involved. She had no doubt he\u2019d do whatever was necessary to keep that from happening. So, if the vampires were the only game in town, then Emma intended to make sure they played by the rules. Because if they didn\u2019t, then she\u2019d do whatever she had to do to find justice for Lacey.</p><p>She finally reached the hallway outside Guy Coffer\u2019s office and paused to catch her breath before going in. Coffer had been in Congress for enough years that he had one of the more decent office suites. Not as grand as others, but nowhere near as tiny as the ones she\u2019d seen some of the freshman legislators squeezed into. She smoothed her skirt and pulled open the big wooden door, steeling herself against the expected wave of curious attention. She stepped inside and, for a brief moment, everyone seemed to stop what they were doing. Then, as if they\u2019d all become aware of it at the same time, the noise returned in a rush and everything was normal again.</p><p>Emma felt her face heat with embarrassment as she crossed the outer reception area. She\u2019d never liked being the center of attention. Open double doors led into the second office. Everyone pretended not to notice her as she hurried into the third office of the shotgun styled suite and over to the corner she shared with Noreen. Her friend was at her desk, her back to Emma as she pecked furiously at a computer keyboard. The typing stopped, and Noreen turned as Emma slid into her chair.</p><p>\u201cHey, Emma. I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d be here today. How\u2019re you doing?\u201d Noreen\u2019s big, brown eyes were wide with concern. She\u2019d been the only one from the office who\u2019d come to Lacey\u2019s memorial last night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Emma said, the lie rolling off her tongue. People really didn\u2019t want to know how she was. Death was too terrifying. Everyone knew it happened, but they were almost embarrassed to ask about it.</p><p>Noreen studied her for a moment. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe it now, hon, but time really does heal.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded. It wasn\u2019t time that would heal in this case; it was revenge. But she was sure Noreen didn\u2019t want to hear about that either.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Noreen,\u201d she said, meeting the other woman\u2019s gaze. \u201cAnd thank you for coming last night.\u201d She opened a drawer and threw her bag inside. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, wanting to change the subject, \u201cwhat have I missed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not too much. The subcommittee rescheduled at the last minute, something about a pipe leak in the meeting room, if you can believe it, so everything\u2014\u201d Noreen\u2019s voice trailed off as her gaze fixed over Emma\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Guy Coffer said from behind her.</p><p>Emma spun her chair around and tried not to jump as Congressman Coffer took her hand and cradled it in both of his. \u201cSharon and I are so sorry for your loss, Emma. All of us are.\u201d</p><p>Emma blinked in surprise. Those were the most words Coffer had said to her since she\u2019d been hired. Usually her instructions came through Sharon or one of the senior staff. The Congressman\u2019s handsome face was creased with sincerity, his eyes meeting hers unflinchingly. It was such a perfectly political moment that she was amazed she\u2019d never noticed before how phony he was. Or maybe it was just that he usually never bothered to wear his campaign face in the office.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything we can do . . .\u201d he said, tightening his hold on her hand just the right amount to indicate his concern.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d she finally managed. \u201cYou\u2019ve already been very kind.\u201d He seemed taken aback by that, and she added, \u201cLetting me take so much time off, for the funeral and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course,\u201d he said, seeming genuinely surprised that she would mention it. \u201cIt\u2019s the decent thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Emma smiled. \u201cI appreciate it anyway, Congressman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked here for two years, Emma. Call me Guy.\u201d</p><p>He knew how long she\u2019d worked for him? She was mildly surprised he even knew her name, much less how long she\u2019d been in his office.</p><p>\u201cGuy,\u201d Sharon Coffer\u2019s sharp voice cut into the moment, and Emma would have sworn she saw the Congressman wince briefly. \u201cYou have people waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Coffer said quickly. He patted Emma\u2019s shoulder awkwardly. \u201cIf you need anything, Emma, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his face smoothing out into its usual bland good looks. The mask was back so quickly that Emma doubted it had ever been gone. She watched as he trailed dutifully behind his wife to the innermost private office. Sharon stepped in after him and closed the door, but not before giving Emma a long, considering look. Like it was Emma\u2019s fault Guy Coffer had done the decent thing and offered his condolences. If she got fired over this, she was going to be well and truly pissed.</p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d Noreen whispered.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Emma muttered.</p><p>She buried herself in work the rest of the day, trying not to count the minutes until sunset, which was at 5:37 precisely. She\u2019d checked online to be sure, before driving to the cemetery and then to the Capitol. She didn\u2019t usually drive to work. Parking was a pain in the butt, and public transportation was quite good. But it would save her time getting to Duncan\u2019s tonight. Her biggest problem would be getting out of the office that early, but she\u2019d already decided she wasn\u2019t going to ask anyone; she was simply going to leave. Let them think whatever they wanted, that she was overcome with grief, that she still had business to take care of regarding Lacey\u2019s death. She didn\u2019t care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, when the discreet clock on the office wall clicked over to 6:00 pm, Emma straightened her desk, shut down her computer, stood and pulled her purse out of her desk drawer.</p><p>Noreen looked up at her in surprise, but Emma simply said, \u201cThere are some things I need to take care of.\u201d Then she slipped the strap of her purse over her shoulder and walked out of the office as casually as if she left this early every day. Once outside the building though, she picked up the pace, moving across the crowded parking lot as quickly as she could in the ridiculously high Jimmy Choos. Duncan had promised her she could help, and she wasn\u2019t going to give him any excuse to go back on that promise.</p><p>Traffic was its usual snarled mess, but less than an hour later, Emma drove right up to the gate of Duncan\u2019s house\u2014he\u2019d made it clear that it wasn\u2019t an embassy\u2014no parking down the block and sneaking past a dump truck. Not that it would have been possible. It was obvious there was new management in town. The gate was not only securely closed, but there were two burly and well-armed men\u2014or maybe vampires\u2014standing in front of it. When she pulled closer, she could see even more armed guards prowling around inside the grounds.</p> <p>She pulled up to the closed gate and stopped, rolling down her window.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, handing him her driver\u2019s license. \u201cAmbas\u2014er, that is, Duncan is expecting me.\u201d</p><p>The guard\u2014and oh, yes, he was a vampire. He made no attempt to conceal his fangs as he looked from her license to her face and back again. He didn\u2019t say anything, but turned away from her long enough to hand her license to a second guard who had remained in the small gate hut. That one studied her license for himself, entered something into an unseen computer, then pulled out a cell phone and hit a speed dial number. He glanced up and saw her watching, then gave her his back while he spoke to whomever he\u2019d called. Emma could hear his voice, but not make out the words. She was pretty sure it was English, but wouldn\u2019t have sworn to it. And all the while the first vampire guard stood right next to her car, his arms resting on a big, black gun slung over his chest on a sling of some sort, while he watched her unblinking.</p><p>Emma wanted desperately to move, to tap her fingers or pound the steering wheel and give a good scream to release some stress. She always got twitchy when she was nervous or excited, and tonight it was a combination of both. But with the unfriendly vamp standing right outside, that probably wasn\u2019t a good idea. So instead she focused on what she could see of the house through the iron bars, trying to spot all the security people who had sprouted up from seemingly nowhere in the few days since she\u2019d last been here. She jumped when the gate suddenly began sliding open.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re expecting you,\u201d the first vampire said in a flat voice. He handed back her license. \u201cPark in the area to the right.\u201d He pointed to a small paved area about twenty yards from the front door. \u201cSomeone will meet you at the door.\u201d</p> <p>Emma took her license, proud that her fingers remained steady. Rather than sit under his scrutiny while she put it away, she dropped it into the center console and pulled slowly forward, feeling a sharp double bump underneath as her car rolled over the gate\u2019s thick metal tracks. She took the right hand arm of the curved driveway and parked near the big house, sitting there a moment and looking around. Hers was the only sedan in the parking area, but there were quite a few trucks of various sizes. Most of the trucks were either piled high with construction material, or looked like they\u2019d recently been emptied of the same. Their tail gates hung open, and ropes and bungee cords were lying in the truck beds like forlorn snakes. Obviously, there was some remodeling going on inside the house. She didn\u2019t see any of Duncan\u2019s SUVs, though, so she figured there was a garage around back, or maybe a separate parking area.</p><p>Emma breathed out a nervous laugh and decided she\u2019d wasted enough time worrying about where other people were parked. She opened her car door and swung her legs out, which was made more awkward than usual by the stiletto heels. She had some more practical clothes with her and had actually intended to change before she left the office, but when the time came, she\u2019d been too worried that Sharon or someone else would drag her back to her desk for one last question or phone call. So she still wore the somber dark gray suit she\u2019d worn to the cemetery this morning, with its snug skirt and tailored jacket, and still wore the ridiculously high heels. But at least she looked good. Er, professional. It wasn\u2019t as if she cared whether Duncan found her attractive or not. She merely wanted him to think of her as a professional, someone he could rely on to get the job done.</p><p>Oh, who was she kidding? She hoped she knocked his socks off. That kiss last night had only made her want another taste of the delectable Duncan. She appreciated his sensitivity in not wanting to take advantage of her vulnerability, but she\u2019d spent the night wide awake, trying not to think about Lacey and thinking about Duncan instead. She knew it was part of the grieving process, the desire to lose herself in the physical as a way of forgetting the emotional. But whatever it was, she wanted more of him, and if his body had been telling her anything last night, it was that he wouldn\u2019t object.</p><p>She hefted the purse with her laptop over her shoulder and grabbed the gym bag with her change of clothes from the backseat. Beeping her car locked, she headed for the fan-shaped brick stairs, but before she\u2019d put her foot on the lowest step, someone opened the door.</p><p>Emma looked up, her heart spiking in anticipation. But it was only . . . Louis, that was his name. He stood in the open doorway, smiling pleasantly and without even a glimpse of fang.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Ms. Duquet,\u201d he said politely, standing back so she could enter. \u201cLord Duncan is expecting you.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Duncan?</p><p>\u201cUm, thank you,\u201d she said, trying not to fidget. \u201cIs there somewhere . . .\u201d She held up her gym bag, silently asking if there was somewhere she could change. Apparently she should have been more explicit, because Louis took the bag from her and walked over to the room where she\u2019d met Duncan the other night, the room with the books. Emma followed him, but stopped in the doorway to stare. The books were gone and so was the room. Well, not precisely, the room was still there, but it looked completely different. The walls were bare and painted a bland, soothing warm beige, and the furniture looked like something you\u2019d find in a nicely appointed dentist\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the books?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd the Tiffany lamps?\u201d</p><p>Louis gave her an infectious grin. \u201cMy lord liked the room, so we moved it for him.\u201d</p><p>Emma blinked. \u201cThe entire room?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cClose enough.\u201d He dropped her gym bag on the floor of the newly refurbished waiting room and indicated the purse over her shoulder. \u201cYou can leave that here for now, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got my laptop in it.\u201d</p><p>He winked. \u201cIt\u2019ll be perfectly safe here. Honest.\u201d</p> <p>Emma scowled as she felt embarrassment heat her cheeks. She let the purse slide down her arm and rested it carefully on top of the gym bag.</p><p>Louis nodded and gestured down the hall behind the stairs. \u201cThey\u2019re in the gym. Come on, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Emma opened her mouth to protest\u2014she was hardly dressed for the gym\u2014but Louis took off so quickly that she found herself hurrying to keep up. She followed him down a dark hallway that passed right under the stairs. It intersected a brightly lit corridor that seemed to run the length of the house in either direction. Louis turned right and kept going, glancing once over his shoulder to make sure she was still with him.</p><p>Emma was struck by the change from her first night here, when it had been so quiet and empty. She\u2019d only seen Duncan and Miguel that night, and it had been like whispering in a church. But now the house was filled with noise. For one thing, it sounded like someone was tearing down the walls upstairs, and she could hear shouts and thumping sounds emanating from below her feet, presumably in the basement. Clearly, the former library wasn\u2019t the only room being renovated. She caught the startled glance of a big black guy who was working over a drafting table in one of the rooms she passed. And another man\u2014or a vampire?\u2014this one shorter than she was, and wiry, nearly bowled her over as he raced out of a doorway right in front of her and headed back the way they\u2019d come. Emma was still catching her breath from that encounter, when a huge crashing noise echoed from the general direction of the front door.</p><p>She jumped at the sound and looked anxiously over her shoulder, but Louis merely grinned as he spun to face her and walked backwards a few steps. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ms. Duquet. It\u2019s just a bit of remodeling. Come on, we\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u201d turned out to be a large, wide-open, high-ceilinged room, which she was certain had originally been a banquet room, not the gym it currently was. The vampires had stripped it bare and laid down some padding on the floor, but they hadn\u2019t had time to paint. She could still see the discolorations on the walls where huge artwork of some sort had once hung. And then there was the giant medallion embellishment in the center of the high ceiling, which certainly had never been intended to witness sweaty vampires working out. Incongruously, there were still heavy, gold brocade drapes pulled over every window, with velvet swags and twisted gold rope tiebacks.</p><p>\u201cStand over here,\u201d Louis said quietly, and Emma realized there was a fight going on out on the mats. Four other vampires stood against the wall on the sidelines. They studied her distrustfully until Louis did some sort of intricate sign language thing, and they all turned their attention back to the center of the room. Emma followed suit and blinked at what she found there. Two males, stripped down to nothing but loosely tied gi pants, their feet and chests bare, were engaged in a blazing martial arts battle that moved back and forth across the room so fast they were almost a blur. One had short dark hair, she could see that much, and the other . . . Emma caught her breath.</p><p>It was Duncan. And the other fighter was his lieutenant, Miguel. And to call what they were doing a fight didn\u2019t do it justice. It was more of a dance, although no doubt it would have been deadly if they\u2019d wanted it to be. The two of them were pure, lethal grace, as they snapped out kick after kick, seeming to defy gravity as they twisted in midair, then changed tactics to meet in a whirlwind of fists and grunts, each blocking as many hits as he took. Emma winced as the sound of flesh hitting flesh echoed off the bare walls, some of the hits so powerful she knew a human would have been down and screaming long ago. She stifled a gasp, hand over her mouth, when Miguel connected with a hard fist to Duncan\u2019s jaw, his head twisting with the force of it. But it didn\u2019t stop him. Duncan flowed with the hit, ducking low and spinning around and up into the air, one leg flying out like a battering ram, striking the side of Miguel\u2019s neck. Miguel hunched under the blow and staggered briefly, then came up again as the two of them fought face-to-face once more, moving back and forth across the floor, neither of them appearing to be superior to the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly, Duncan went low, digging his shoulder into Miguel\u2019s gut and plowing over and under. He tossed Miguel over his back and sent him at least ten feet into the air. Miguel landed with a hard crack of wood, despite the heavy mats. Impossibly, he was on his feet in an instant, charging back as the two of them went toe-to-toe like two heavyweight boxers with no survival instincts. Fists clenched, they exchanged blow after blow until they were both bloody, until Miguel suddenly grabbed Duncan\u2019s arm, dipped and spun, tossing him over his shoulder.</p><p>Duncan came up grinning, mouth dripping blood, fangs gleaming as he took several running steps and flew into the air, his feet hitting Miguel\u2019s chest in a one, two, three pattern that sent the dark-haired vamp flying backwards to land flat on the mat with another backbreaking thud. Or maybe not backbreaking for a vampire, because Miguel came to his feet again, laughing like a lunatic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been practicing, old man\u201d he said, assuming a defensive posture once again.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s lord old man to you, youngling. And maybe you\u2019re getting lazy,\u201d Duncan taunted.</p><p>\u201cWords are cheap, my lord,\u201d Miguel growled. And it was Duncan\u2019s turn to laugh.</p><p>He was still laughing when he happened to glance over and caught sight of Emma. He lifted a hand, palm out, to stop Miguel, then tilted his head slightly as he took in the unlikely sight of Emma standing in his gym wearing her somber gray suit and high heels. He grinned at her, his hard muscled chest heaving, gleaming with sweat, drawstring gi pants hanging low on narrow hips to reveal a hard, flat abdomen and just a glimpse of that sweet narrowing of muscle into a man\u2019s groin.</p><p>Emma stared, her mouth dry and her heart twisting oddly in her chest. She wanted. And if the hunger on Duncan\u2019s face was anything to go by, he wanted her right back.</p><p>Or maybe he was just hungry. As in blood. She watched warily as Duncan prowled over to her, his hips rolling bonelessly like a big cat\u2019s, his gaze raking up and down her form before settling on her face with a lazy, slow blink of his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cEmma.\u201d His voice was a seductive purr that turned her name into a caress.</p><p>She wet her lips nervously, and then caught herself, refusing to give him the satisfaction of knowing he\u2019d rattled her. \u201cHey,\u201d she said, pleased by how normal her voice sounded. \u201cYou wanted me here an hour after sunset. Here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d he repeated, his eyes dipping to scan her figure once more. \u201cYou look very lovely this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, thanks.\u201d It was such a Southern gentlemanly thing to say, the kind of thing young men of breeding learned in cotillion class. Emma didn\u2019t know if he really meant it, or if he was only being polite. Although, polite wasn\u2019t the word she\u2019d have used to describe the way he was looking at her. No, nothing polite about that at all.</p><p>\u201cI brought clothes to change into,\u201d she told him, determined to take control of the conversation again . . . if she\u2019d ever had it in the first place. \u201cI wore these to the burial this morning and\u2014\u201d</p><p>A look of genuine dismay crossed Duncan\u2019s face, and he took a sudden step closer, brushing the backs of his fingers down her cheek. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI was thoughtless. How are you?\u201d</p> <p>Emma blinked up at him, feeling the heat of his big body, inhaling the clean, masculine scent of his sweat. He was so close and her heels were so high that if she raised up the tiniest bit, their lips would touch. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMister Pettry was very kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need more time, this can wait. You needn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said immediately, cutting off the rest of his words. \u201cI want to do this. I need to do this.\u201d</p><p>His full lips curved slightly, and she thought she saw something like respect in his eyes. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cLouis will show you to a room where you can change.\u201d</p><p>He looked beyond her to where the other vampire waited. \u201cOne of the guests rooms, Louis, with a bath. You know better than I do what\u2019s available. And then get Ms. Duquet set up in the security center with the headshots and a computer. Phoebe will be by later to work with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stepped back, turning away from her to catch a towel that Miguel tossed at him. He rubbed it over his face and neck, and she noticed a very slight pink tinge to his sweat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to shower and change myself,\u201d he said, then lifted her hand, barely touching the back of it with his lips. \u201cWe\u2019ll see each other again soon.\u201d</p> <p>Emma tucked her hand in the pocket of her jacket to keep it from trembling as she watched Duncan stroll from the room, followed by Miguel. The other vampires had moved out onto the gym floor and were engaged in more rapid fire bouts of fighting. She couldn\u2019t have said what the particular discipline was. She didn\u2019t know enough about any of them. Her only experience with martial arts had been two weeks of a disastrous class she\u2019d taken in college. Every inch of her body had ached\u2014no, ached was too kind a word for how she\u2019d felt. Her body had hurt, and she\u2019d finally decided there had to be a better way of staying fit.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, Ms. Duquet?\u201d</p><p>Emma jerked her head around to stare at Louis. Apparently, she\u2019d been daydreaming. Gosh, she thought. I wonder why?</p><p>\u201cThanks, Louis,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cAnd please, call me Emma,\u201d she added as she followed him back down the hallway. After about ten steps, she thought to ask, \u201cWho\u2019s Phoebe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend. She works with the FBI. Duncan called her out to Leesburg the other night. I isolated some video composites, and Phoebe\u2019s running them through some identification software she has access to.</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t remember seeing a woman among Duncan\u2019s vampires, but there was a lot about that night that was a blur. \u201cI didn\u2019t meet her, did I?\u201d</p><p>Louis stopped long enough to give her a weirdly intense look. \u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cShe arrived after you were gone.\u201d</p><p>He started walking again, and Emma frowned at his back. Was there something she\u2019d missed? Maybe Duncan and Phoebe were more than just friends. And maybe Louis was close to Phoebe and resented the obvious sexual tension between Duncan and Emma. Or maybe Emma was letting her imagination run around in her head like a schizophrenic yappy dog.</p><p>Yeah, that was probably it.</p><p>After going back to the waiting room to retrieve her things, Emma picked up her purse and laptop, while Louis carried the gym bag upstairs for her. It wasn\u2019t all that heavy, and Emma could have done it herself. She\u2019d learned long ago, however, to let guys carry things if they wanted to. Truth was, she kind of liked men who were still gallant, who opened doors and who offered their seats to women. She drew the line at car doors, because she felt too silly sitting there like a lump while the guy ran around the car. But she didn\u2019t mind the other stuff. It was nice. So, she let Louis carry the gym bag to a bedroom on the second floor. He dropped it at the foot of the bed and backed quickly out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working right down there,\u201d he said, pointing. \u201cJoin us whenever you\u2019re ready. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Emma said. \u201cI won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo rush.\u201d He gave her a toothy grin. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here all night.\u201d</p><p>Emma chuckled dutifully, waiting until he had disappeared down the hall before closing the door. She looked around. It was a nice room. Sort of dated and frilly, and not really to her taste, but the furniture was beautiful and everything was clean. And there was an en suite bathroom. She hurried in that direction, having been in such a rush to make it out of the Capitol building before anyone stopped her, that she\u2019d ignored that particular necessity.</p><p>Washing her hands afterward, she stared at her reflection in the mirror over the sink and wondered why any man, much less one with Duncan\u2019s looks and sheer masculine charisma, would give her a second glance. She looked awful. Too many nights with too little sleep had put circles like dark, purple bruises under her eyes. And they were all the more obvious because her skin was pale and drawn. She hadn\u2019t bothered with mascara this morning. She\u2019d known it would just be cried off, but she had naturally thick eyelashes, so that part wasn\u2019t too bad. Even her lipstick was gone, probably chewed off on the way over here. Her face was one big, pale blotch with tired eyes, and it was topped off by a dark tangle of messy hair. Lovely.</p><p>She sighed and turned away. She had a hair brush in her bag, and a bit of lip gloss couldn\u2019t hurt either.</p><p>It was only a matter of minutes before the Jimmy Choo pumps had switched places with her Nikes in the gym bag, along with her neatly folded office clothes. She finished tying her shoes and crossed to the bathroom to study her reflection once again. She looked better. Not great, but definitely better. She wore a faded pair of denims, loose enough to be comfortable, but tight enough that she knew they looked good on her. Emma worked hard to keep in shape and didn\u2019t mind letting it show. What was the point otherwise? Along with the denims, she wore a white, long-sleeved, cotton t-shirt, and a zippered hoodie to keep her warm just in case. She tucked the tube of lip gloss in the side pocket of her hoodie and left the rest of her stuff where it was.</p><p>She opened the door and turned in the direction Louis had indicated. She could already hear a steady buzz of conversation and clicking computer keys, occasionally punctuated by vicious swearing in a variety of languages. She followed the noise about halfway down the hall to another bare-walled room, this one much smaller than the gym downstairs. It was probably intended as a bedroom, but it now held a mishmash of tables and desks set at haphazard angles with no obvious pattern. Computers and other equipment sat everywhere, and the various kinds of cables slinking between them were a disaster waiting to happen as they snaked and twisted from desk to desk and all over the floor. Although, maybe vampires didn\u2019t have to worry about falling on their asses like she did.</p><p>She frowned. If this was their security center, she wasn\u2019t that impressed. She\u2019d expected something more professional from Duncan\u2019s team, or at least more orderly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Louis came up to her and must have seen the doubt in her expression, because he said, \u201cIt\u2019s temporary until we get the new room outfitted downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Emma forced herself to smile. \u201cAs long as it all works, that\u2019s what matters,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, it works,\u201d Louis assured her. \u201cThey may not look like much, but\u2014\u201d A chorus of growls greeted this assessment and he laughed. \u201cBut they\u2019re some of the best operators in the world. Between us, there isn\u2019t a code we can\u2019t crack, or a system we can\u2019t hack.\u201d</p> <p>Emma chuckled at both his lame rhyme and his enthusiasm. It was contagious, and she found her own eagerness growing. Finally, she was doing something positive. Taking care of Lacey, arranging her funeral and laying her body to rest . . . that had been absolutely necessary, and it was a duty Emma had lovingly fulfilled. But it had done nothing to see that justice was served on those who\u2019d killed her. Tonight, at last, Emma would begin the most solemn duty of all, and that was finding whoever was responsible and making them pay.</p><p>Of course, the first steps down that road involved sitting at a computer and doing some basic research. Emma took the photos Louis had grabbed from the videos and cropped them onto a single page, with the idea of deleting them one by one until there were none left. An hour later, she\u2019d managed to identify only two of the women, and those were only because she\u2019d met them at a birthday party for Lacey last year. Even then, she had only their first names and no idea where they worked or lived. But the rest of them . . . She shook her head. There had to be a better way to do this.</p><p>She pushed back from the computer and took a long drink of water from the bottle Louis had dropped on her desk sometime ago. She squinted thoughtfully at the pictures. There were tens of thousands of young, professional women living or working in Washington, D.C. Too many. So she had to narrow it down somehow. First question, how did Victor meet these women? From what Duncan and the others had said about the dead vampire lord and his habits, she deduced he\u2019d had limited social interaction with humans. He\u2019d gone to the occasional fundraiser, but he\u2019d attended only those social gatherings where scoring an invitation was a coup of sorts. He had given parties of his own, but it appeared he\u2019d only invited legislators and lobbyists. None of the usual society doyennes were ever invited, no Hollywood stars, or even the big name media types.</p><p>Emma frowned. So maybe most of the women were drawn from that same pool. Not legislators themselves, and not lobbyists, either. But their secretaries and assistants, young women eager for a chance to mingle with power. Women like Lacey.</p><p>Emma sat up straight. That was it! And she had a much better way of identifying them if she was right.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she said to no one in particular, and rushed down the hall to the room where she\u2019d left her things, including her purse and laptop. Hurrying into the frilly bedroom, she dropped to her knees and dragged her enormous purse from under the chair where she\u2019d shoved it earlier. She pulled out her computer and opened the lid, waiting impatiently while it woke up and searched for the house\u2019s Wi-Fi connection. It asked for a password, and she swore in frustration. She should have thought of that.</p><p>She shoved her purse out of the way again and had gathered her legs beneath her to stand when someone tapped lightly on the door and pushed it open.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at the sound of Duncan\u2019s voice, her smile freezing as he stepped into view. She could only stare. Sweaty, bare-chested Duncan was gone, and in his place . . . she sighed with pleasure. Emma loved a man in a tux, but Duncan in a tux took her breath away. Lacey would have known which designer was responsible; Emma only knew that Duncan should have graced the pages of the most exclusive fashion magazine. He had a body made for formalwear, with broad shoulders and narrow hips, and the tux was tailored to emphasize that perfection. It was simple and black, with narrow, notched lapels and a hint of white cuff. His long, blond hair had been pulled tightly away from his face, so that his hair looked almost short from the front.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d he repeated, holding a hand down to her.</p><p>She sighed and tucked the computer under her arm, holding her other hand up so he could pull her to her feet. This was really too much. It was as if the Fates had figured out the perfect man and said, \u201cHere, Emma, he\u2019s all yours.\u201d Except he wasn\u2019t. He was a powerful vampire and probably had all sorts of beautiful women vying for his attention. She stifled the irrational surge of jealousy that thought evoked, and managed to meet his gaze with a mischievous grin.</p> <p>\u201cYou look very lovely this evening, Duncan,\u201d she said, emphasizing her own accent and letting him know he wasn\u2019t the only one who knew proper cotillion-speak.</p><p>His brown eyes crinkled in amusement. \u201cWhy, thank you, Miz Duquet. You\u2019re very kind.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips thoughtfully. \u201cBut, obviously, you\u2019re not helping out in the research department tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not. Although honestly, I\u2019d rather be doing that. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve a fundraiser to attend. Black tie,\u201d he added, gesturing dismissively at his tux. \u201cIt was on Victor\u2019s calendar, but they\u2019ll be getting me instead. I confess I\u2019m hoping to meet someone useful to our current investigation.\u201d</p><p>Emma sobered immediately. \u201cYou need to be careful, then. Is Miguel going with you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes warmed briefly with humor. \u201cMiguel and Ari both. I\u2019ll be quite safe. I\u2019m more worried about you. By now, the men who killed Lacey will know her body was found. The story you put out, that she died in an auto accident has most likely put them off until now. But after tonight, they\u2019ll know for certain that Victor is gone, and they\u2019ll get nervous again. Especially if there\u2019s any hint that you\u2019re checking into Lacey\u2019s activities before her death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows I\u2019m even here, much less what I\u2019m doing. I told them at the office that I had some things to take care of. They\u2019ll assume it has to do with Lacey\u2019s death, but nothing unusual.\u201d</p><p>Duncan tipped his head in acknowledgment, but said, \u201cStill, I\u2019d feel better if you weren\u2019t all alone in your house. We\u2019ve plenty of room here, you know, and no one would bother you.\u201d</p> <p>Emma hoped Duncan truly couldn\u2019t read her thoughts right about then, because she wouldn\u2019t mind at all if he bothered her. His expression changed, becoming suddenly more intent, and Emma blushed, convinced that, once again, he did know what she was thinking. He touched his fingers to the heat of her flushed cheek and leaned a little bit closer.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want anything to happen to you, Emmaline,\u201d he murmured, and brushed his lips against hers in a soft, too fleeting kiss.</p><p>Emma stared up at him. \u201cWhy do you call me that?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s your name and I like it. It\u2019s old-fashioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who uses it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He kissed her again, longer this time, but not nearly long enough. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>And just like that he was gone. Emma stared after him in frustration. When he did stuff like that, she was sure he wanted her, just like she\u2019d been sure in the gym when the heat sizzling between them had all but burned her skin. But then he\u2019d step back or get called away, or who knew what else, and he\u2019d disappear, leaving her hot and bothered and wondering.</p><p>Or maybe she was putting too much into what was for him nothing more than a mild flirtation. Maybe he wasn\u2019t looking for anything more than a few hours of sexual gratification. Several hot, sweaty, satisfying hours.</p><p>Emma laughed quietly. Yeah, she could go for that. But then she sighed, knowing herself too well. What she felt for Duncan was more than simple lust. Maybe not a lifetime commitment, not yet anyway, and maybe not ever, but it was more than what a few hours of sweaty sex would satisfy. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d turn down the opportunity if he offered. Especially since she had a feeling they\u2019d be the best few hours of her life.</p><p>She shook herself out of the fantasies flashing across her brain and hurried back to the computer room. She couldn\u2019t do anything about Duncan and his damnable appeal, but she could definitely make a difference in identifying some of the people on Victor\u2019s list. She gripped her laptop more securely. She wasn\u2019t a computer hacker like Louis and the other vampires, but she was a compulsive collector of information. And the information on her computer might be exactly what they needed.</p><p>Duncan climbed the aged brick stairs of the private home where Senator Max Grafton was holding a fundraiser. Strictly speaking, of course, it wasn\u2019t the senator holding the fundraiser, but one of his supporters. Someone wealthy enough to afford this Georgetown townhouse which made up for its tiny lot by climbing four stories above street level. Miguel walked beside him, and Ari would remain with the SUV. He\u2019d ignored the valet service, but he probably wasn\u2019t the only one. This kind of affair drew nothing but wealthy guests, people who could help the senator get reelected by writing a check and/or coaxing others to join them. Duncan also knew from personal experience that, despite official protestations to the contrary, money talked. If you donated enough money to the right politician, you bought that politician\u2019s ear and often his vote as well. It had been that way for as long as some humans had been raised into positions of power, and it always would be.</p><p>A discreetly colored awning had been stretched above the stoop in front of the townhouse, and two security types were stationed on the small square landing to screen guests. Their glances skated over Duncan, but lingered on Miguel who made no bones about what he was\u2014a highly trained and motivated bodyguard. He was also armed, but that, too wasn\u2019t unusual. At a gathering like this there would be other private security, and they would all be armed. They couldn\u2019t do their job otherwise. The men guarding the door didn\u2019t know it, but Miguel could probably have done his job just as well without the gun. For that matter, Duncan could do Miguel\u2019s job. Until a few days ago, a great part of his job had been to protect Raphael. But that was before he\u2019d become a vampire lord himself, and now his world had forever changed. He was not yet certain if he preferred it this way, but it was too late for regrets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Miguel sized the guards up as they did the same to him. None of them gave any indication of their thoughts, not even a twitch of a muscle. But Duncan knew the two human guards were both troubled and puzzled by Miguel, sensing there was something different about him, but not knowing what. They didn\u2019t know yet that Miguel and Duncan were both Vampire. Not yet.</p><p>Miguel handed over Duncan\u2019s invitation\u2014well, Victor\u2019s invitation, but it was Duncan\u2019s now. He smiled grimly at the thought, even as he watched the guard\u2019s eyes widen when he read the name. The human stiffened, did a quick reappraisal of Miguel, then shot a glance at Duncan who met his gaze calmly.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Duncan said finally. He put a little punch of power into it, tired of being forced to wait on the porch like an unwelcome solicitor.</p> <p>The guard nearest the inside door jumped at the reminder. Regardless of his feelings about vampires, Duncan was an invited guest at a party where only the most powerful were welcome. The guard pushed the door open and stepped aside, pressing himself against the wall to avoid accidentally brushing against Duncan as he went by. Duncan smiled in amusement, wondering what the man feared. Did he think vampirism was contagious? That if he touched Duncan, he\u2019d turn into a slavering animal? But, no, the guard was broadcasting his emotions like a brass band. He was terrified, but not of catching a disease. He was afraid of Duncan himself, as if Duncan was a wild animal who could turn at any moment and rip out his throat for no reason. Duncan sighed inwardly. The man was a fool, but educating misinformed humans wasn\u2019t his purpose here this evening.</p><p>He entered the crowded townhouse, and immediately winced at the level of noise. Directly in front of him was a dark hallway, and to the right of that a narrow staircase that twisted up beneath the low ceiling. A few people lingered on the stairs, as if caught going up or down, but most of the guests he could see were in a drawing room to one side. A fireplace gave the room a welcome feel, but it was hardly necessary to add any heat. Not with all those people standing about and talking nonstop. There were more people upstairs; he could hear them talking and laughing. More oppressive than the noise, though, was the press of emotion from too many minds in a singularly confined space.</p><p>Duncan kept his face carefully impassive, but it was an effort. This was a large home, as such things went, and perhaps with fewer people it would have seemed more spacious. But as it was, Duncan felt as if he was being squeezed from all sides by humans who maintained a steady stream of dialogue, but had very little to say.</p><p>\u201cAmbassador Milford?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice calling his last name drew him out of his thoughts. He looked up to see an elegantly dressed matron coming his way, her very high heels making tinny tapping noises on a checkered marble floor that reminded him of the courtyard in front of what used to be Alexandra\u2019s house in Malibu. The human woman drew closer, her curious gaze never leaving his face. She was attractive for her age and fashionably thin, with the perfect smile of a professional hostess.</p><p>\u201cWe received word you would be joining us, Ambassador.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan inclined his head. \u201cMadam . . .\u201d he said leadingly.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d she said, and laughed as she drew close enough to extend a hand. \u201cMargery Whitlow. I\u2019m delighted to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Duncan took her hand and squeezed carefully, feeling the movement of fragile bones beneath his fingers. \u201cMrs. Whitlow, of course,\u201d he said, remembering the name of the hosting couple from Victor\u2019s invitation.</p><p>\u201cOh, call me Margery,\u201d she said, and laughed again. She had a refreshingly genuine laugh, not something one usually encountered at parties like this, Duncan thought.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Whitlow is so stuffy,\u201d she added. Her glance strayed to Miguel, but she didn\u2019t say anything, clearly dismissing him as one more bodyguard. \u201cSenator Grafton was most intrigued when I told him your staff had called. None of us knew Victor was leaving. It must have been quite sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d Duncan said noncommittally.</p> <p>Margery paused for a moment, probably expecting him to offer an explanation. When none was forthcoming, however, she recovered deftly. \u201cYou have your work cut out for you, settling into a new post on such short notice. It was good of you to make time for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, Margery,\u201d Duncan said. He deliberately laced his words with a touch of seduction, and sensed the little rush of excitement she felt when he said her name. \u201cThere is a lot to do at the house, but houses can always wait,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased at this opportunity to meet Senator Grafton\u2014and yourself, of course.\u201d</p><p>Margery flushed with pleasure, and Duncan smiled.</p><p>\u201cMargery!\u201d An over-perfumed woman emerged from one of the side rooms, her arms held out in embrace. \u201cI missed you when we came in.\u201d</p><p>Margery pulled away from Duncan with obvious reluctance, her gaze lingering on his face even as her body turned to greet the other woman. \u201cGloria,\u201d she gushed with totally faked enthusiasm. \u201cHow long has it been, darling?\u201d</p><p>Duncan took advantage of the distraction to move in among the other guests. Miguel lingered near the doorway as Duncan glided from cluster to cluster of humans, picking up names and tidbits of gossip, introducing himself, and charming the locals. He was good at this sort of thing, much better than Raphael, and his Sire would be the first to admit it. Raphael at his most humble and charming was still massively intimidating. He couldn\u2019t help it; it was simply who he was. Duncan, on the other hand, had the ability to lull the humans into forgetting what he was.</p><p>He was deep in conversation with the wife of a famous French author, modestly accepting her compliments on his impeccable accent, when Margery touched his elbow.</p><p>\u201cAmbassador,\u201d she said eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ve been neglecting you. Come. You must meet Senator Grafton. He\u2019s in the main room upstairs.\u201d</p> <p>She laced her arm through his and pulled him toward the stairway. Miguel stiffened, but Duncan caught his eye and waved him off. With some vampires, her familiarity could have been fatal, but Duncan was too used to humans to be offended. Besides, Margery wasn\u2019t a bad person as far as he could tell. Her strongest feelings toward him were curiosity laced with lust, which was partly his own fault.</p><p>She released his arm when they reached the stairs, which were simply too narrow for such intimacy. Duncan followed her at a discreet distance, Miguel ghosting behind him like a shadow. He had reached the twist in the staircase when another man came into view, heading the opposite direction. He had a ruddy face that spoke of too much booze on too many nights, and he was carrying a crystal tumbler of amber liquid that sloshed recklessly as he started downward. Duncan could smell the peaty scent of Scotch beneath the stink of sweat. The man looked up and saw Duncan coming towards him. He nearly stumbled in such obviously shocked recognition that there was no doubt he knew who Duncan was. Duncan studied his face in return, noting the crude features and scarred visage of an athlete whose best years were behind him.</p><p>\u201cMiguel?\u201d He queried his lieutenant on a narrow telepathic thread. Miguel was his child. This close the other vampire was like an extension of Duncan himself.</p><p>\u201cCongressman Dean Kerwin, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Interesting, Duncan thought. And the man was nervous at seeing Duncan. He nodded at the Congressman, as if he knew who he was, more for the pleasure of seeing the man\u2019s nervous jerk of surprise than anything else.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Margery caroled as he stepped onto the second floor. \u201cI keep losing you.\u201d She hooked her arm through his again and drew him over to one corner of yet another narrow room, this one with thankfully far fewer people in it.</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d she said, closing in on a pair of men deep in conversation. \u201cThis is Ambassador Milford.\u201d</p><p>Max Grafton was a small, compact man with a sharp-featured face and intelligent eyes. And unlike Congressman Kerwin, Grafton was completely sober. The champagne flute in his left hand was artfully drained to half-full, but there was not a hint of alcohol scent about him. He turned away from his companion and extended his right hand to Duncan in greeting.</p><p>\u201cAmbassador,\u201d he said smoothly, his voice surprisingly deep for a man his size.</p><p>\u201cSenator,\u201d Duncan replied, giving him the requisite hardy handshake.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Margery,\u201d Grafton said in obvious dismissal of their hostess.</p><p>Margery made a slight sound of protest that no one but a vampire would have heard, then smiled brightly and turned to Duncan. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll speak again later, Ambassador.\u201d</p><p>On a whim of gentility, Duncan took her fingers and lifted them to his lips, lightly kissing the back of her hand. \u201cIt would be my pleasure, Margery,\u201d he said letting the slow honey of his Southern upbringing flavor the words.</p><p>Margery raised the hand he\u2019d kissed to her flushed cheek. \u201cOh, my,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re one of those charming Southern boys. I\u2019ll have to warn the ladies.\u201d She laughed again in that delighted way, then hurried off on her high heels.</p><p>Duncan turned in time to see a sour look flash across Grafton\u2019s face, before it was quickly erased. \u201cBrad,\u201d Grafton said to his companion. \u201cGive us a moment, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the man said and wandered across the hall to yet another drawing room filled with people.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Grafton said, drawing Duncan\u2019s attention. \u201cDuncan Milford, is it? I don\u2019t think Victor ever used a last name.\u201d</p><p>Duncan couldn\u2019t think of anything to say to that rather inane comment, so he remained silent, studying the human in front of him and wondering at the hostility he could feel rolling off the good senator. He decided on a frontal assault. \u201cVictor spoke highly of you, Senator,\u201d he said. It was a lie, of course. Victor hadn\u2019t spoken to Duncan about anyone, nor would he ever again, but Duncan was curious to see what Grafton\u2019s reaction would be.</p><p>The senator grew very still, those intelligent eyes searching Duncan\u2019s face as if hoping for a clue of some sort. Not that he\u2019d find one.</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d he said finally. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected my name to come up at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Duncan smiled knowingly, as if amused. \u201cCome, Max, we both know\u2014\u201d Grafton\u2019s emotions shot into something very close to panic before Duncan finished his sentence. \u201c\u2014that Victor was a supporter of yours. A whale I believe you call someone like that, a person who is capable of delivering bundled donations of considerable sums.\u201d</p><p>Grafton\u2019s breathing slowly settled into a normal rhythm and he smiled. \u201cAh, that, of course. Victor was very generous.\u201d Grafton took a long sip of his champagne, though it had to be quite warm by now. When he lowered his glass, the mask was firmly back in place. \u201cSo, Milford, you\u2019re from the South?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOriginally,\u201d Duncan agreed. He nodded at a server who appeared with a tray of fresh champagne and took one of the glasses. Grafton\u2019s eyes watched carefully as he took a tasting sip.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you pe\u2014that is, vampires ate regular food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t. But we do drink.\u201d Duncan didn\u2019t bother explaining that while some vampires enjoyed the taste of alcohol, and others the burn, it had no effect whatsoever on their minds.</p><p>\u201cVictor doesn\u2019t. At least not that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Victor, anyway?\u201d Grafton demanded. \u201cI saw him less than two weeks ago and he said nothing about leaving. I do hope he\u2019s well,\u201d he added, as if to soften the demand in his earlier words.</p> <p>Duncan met the senator\u2019s gaze evenly. \u201cPerhaps he didn\u2019t want to trouble you.\u201d</p><p>Grafton studied him a bit longer, then drew closer, as if in confidence. Miguel tensed slightly where he stood near the room\u2019s open archway, but Duncan shot him a quick glance of reassurance. Max Grafton was no danger to Duncan, at least not in the middle of this civilized gathering. Max struck him as more the type to lie in wait with a big gun. Or rather to hire someone else to do it, while Max himself established a credible alibi.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Milford. Will you be assuming . . . all of Victor\u2019s responsibilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the parties,\u201d Duncan said negligently. \u201cOf course. I have all of Victor\u2019s files.\u201d</p><p>Grafton froze and his heart rate soared once again. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nearly laughed out loud, but settled for a grin that made his amusement plain. \u201cGrafton, please. A man of your sophistication and . . . tastes? You must have known Victor was taping everything that went on at that house. You preferred blondes, didn\u2019t you? You and the drunken Congressman Kerwin, both. In fact, I believe you shared one or two.\u201d</p> <p>Grafton stared at Duncan, his face pale and his breathing so rapid that Duncan feared the man would pass out. He swallowed hard once, twice, and then his lips tightened in anger and he snarled, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re pulling, Milford. But I will not be harassed in this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarassed,\u201d Duncan hissed, leaning right into the good senator\u2019s space. \u201cYou\u2019re confusing me with Victor, Grafton, and that would be a mistake. I don\u2019t harass my enemies. I eliminate them. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stepped back and signaled to Miguel, who waited until Duncan had walked past and then followed him. The stairs were empty as they headed straight for the door, their mission, such as it was, accomplished for the evening. He heard Miguel calling Ari on the radio, telling him to bring the SUV around, and by the time they were once again out of that claustrophobic house, the familiar vehicle was rolling up to the curb. Ari powered down the window so they could see him, but remained behind the wheel as Miguel opened the back door for Duncan, then followed him inside.</p><p>Duncan had felt Miguel\u2019s anger growing all the way out of that house and onto the street, and he suspected it was directed at him. Once they got underway, he placed a casual arm over the back of the seat and glanced at his lieutenant sitting next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Miguel?\u201d</p><p>Miguel shot him an angry look. \u201cYou all but invited him to come after you, Sire. You\u2019ve set yourself up as bait.\u201d</p><p>Duncan shrugged. \u201cPerhaps. But it seemed the fastest way to flush them out. Kerwin looked familiar, didn\u2019t he? He certainly knew who I was. And I\u2019d lay good money that Kerwin and Grafton were conferring before I showed up and ruined their party. Emma needs to see Lacey\u2019s murder avenged, Miguel, and I want this matter done with. It isn\u2019t what we came to this city to accomplish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that, my lord. But the job will proceed much faster if you\u2019re alive to do it,\u201d he growled.</p> <p>Duncan sighed. Miguel had a point, but he knew men like Grafton. Unless Duncan pushed and pushed hard, they could dance around each other for months. Emma deserved better than that. She\u2019d never be able to get on with her life until this was resolved.</p><p>Next to him, Miguel clicked the receiver on the Bluetooth device in his ear, answering a silent call. Duncan frowned. As far as anyone knew, they were still at the fundraiser, which meant no one would call unless it was urgent.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Miguel snapped into the phone. \u201cWho is\u2014 Where are you now? No. No! Don\u2019t call anyone. We\u2019re on our way. Five minutes.\u201d He leaned toward Ari before he\u2019d even clicked off. \u201cEmma Duquet\u2019s place, Ari. Fast.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>After Duncan left, Emma hurried back to the security center and plugged in her laptop. No sense in draining the battery if she didn\u2019t have to. Louis glanced over when she returned, but he kept working on his own computer, fingers flying at a remarkable speed. The vampires were all happy to let her do the grunt work of wading through photos, trying to figure out who was who. That was okay with her, as long as they let her do something. Pulling up her database, she scanned the information and sorted out the fields she thought would help.</p><p>Part of Emma\u2019s job at Guy Coffer\u2019s office had been filtering the daily requests from lobbyists who wanted to see the Congressman about one thing or another. Sometimes, they wanted a face-to-face, sometimes they only wanted to invite him to a cocktail party or other glad-handing social event. The thing was, there were something like eleven thousand lobbyists in Washington, D.C., and every one of them thought their particular issue was the most important thing on the planet. She didn\u2019t fault them for that; it was their job to feel that way. But Congressman Coffer sat on a couple of very influential committees whose influence went beyond any one issue. And that meant a whole lot of lobbyists were after his vote. Emma\u2019s job was to weed through the requests and provide a daily report as to who wanted what and whether they were worth the Congressman\u2019s time. The deciding factor was usually money in the form of campaign donations, but since she was a government employee, her time couldn\u2019t be used for any fundraising purpose. So her reports had to be couched in other terms, like importance to a particular constituency or public awareness of an important issue. It was all bullshit. But money won elections, and publicity provided sound bites so the people back home felt like their congressman was doing something once they elected him.</p><p>Emma, being the hyperactive Energizer Bunny she was, had built up a database of information on the various lobbyists\u2014names, affiliations, contact info\u2014along with information on the assistants and secretaries she dealt with at least as often as their bosses. She pulled up the list of initials they had from Victor\u2019s files and started working, trying to match them with her various contacts. It took far longer than she expected and was ultimately disappointing. There were too many women with the same initials, and no way of sorting them by likelihood. If she\u2019d had marital status in her database, for example, she could have eliminated the married women, at least on the first cut. Some of them, she knew, were too old to match any of the photographed women, but for most she had no idea if they were the ones she was looking for or not.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Louis said from behind her.</p><p>She straightened and turned around, rubbing her back, which had gone stiff from sitting hunched over the computer.</p><p>A woman stood next to Louis. She was petite, with a wild mane of curly dark hair, and she had to be a vampire. Either that or Duncan was employing teenagers now, because this woman looked about nineteen in her tight, faded jeans and bright red sweater.</p><p>\u201cEmma, this is Phoebe Micheletti. She\u2019s the one I told you about, with the FBI.\u201d</p><p>Okay, definitely a vampire. But it was kind of unsettling to know the FBI had vampires working for them. The conspiracy theorists would go nuts if they knew!</p><p>\u201cFormer FBI, and only a consultant,\u201d Micheletti corrected, and smiled as she held out her hand.</p><p>Emma stood, automatically taking Micheletti\u2019s hand, feeling the strength in those delicate fingers. \u201cEmma Duquet,\u201d she said. \u201cLouis mentioned you\u2019d be coming by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I am.\u201d She made a shooing motion at Louis and said, \u201cRun along, Louis, I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d</p><p>Emma blinked, waiting for Louis to react to the female vamp\u2019s dismissal, but he laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t have her, Pheebs. If Emma wants a job, Duncan has first dibs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Phoebe said innocently.</p><p>Louis gave her a skeptical look, but strode back to his computers.</p><p>Phoebe continued to watch as Louis sat down and bent to work once again. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best hackers alive, you know. I tried to recruit him for my firm, but he\u2019s Duncan\u2019s down to the bone.\u201d She looked at Emma. \u201cIf Louis wants you, you must be good.\u201d</p><p>Emma shrugged uncomfortably. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything yet. I think he\u2019s just happy someone else is doing the grunt work.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe had been reading over Emma\u2019s shoulder, her eyes switching between Emma\u2019s computer with its database and the list of initials. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my own database of lobbyists and their affiliates. I work for Congressman Coffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Phoebe said. \u201cThat explains it. Louis is a compulsive collector of information. He has database envy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma laughed. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t done me much good yet. I never thought I\u2019d say this, but there\u2019s too much information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo luck, then?\u201d Phoebe murmured, sitting on the chair next to Emma\u2019s and paging through her notes. The action irritated Emma for some reason. Those were her notes. The female vamp could have at least asked before she started snooping through them.</p><p>She realized Phoebe was waiting for her to say something. \u201cNo luck,\u201d she said, remembering the question. \u201cNot yet. But I\u2019m still working.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about the men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouis said you were working on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Phoebe said, flashing a smile. \u201cBut like you, I haven\u2019t had any luck yet. You have what, hundreds of entries in your database?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThousands,\u201d Emma corrected, feeling insulted and fighting the urge to snatch her database away from the former FBI consultant. Hundreds of entries, indeed. And was there any such thing as a former FBI consultant? She wasn\u2019t sure she wanted anyone in government seeing the information on her computer, much less the FBI. Forget that she herself worked for the government. It wasn\u2019t the same thing at all.</p><p>\u201cThousands,\u201d Phoebe allowed. \u201cBut there are millions in our facial recognition database, and as brilliant as Louis is, those composites were . . .\u201d She shrugged without finishing her thought, but it was obvious she didn\u2019t think they were very useful.</p> <p>Emma sat back down at her computer, feeling an irrational need to defend her methods. \u201cI was thinking about this before you came in. If I could identify even one of these women, it would lead to the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they all know each other. They all go to the same parties, and I\u2019m not only talking about Victor\u2019s. The people who work inside the Beltway are like a small town. Everyone knows everyone, or knows someone who does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, maybe we go to a few of those parties ourselves,\u201d Phoebe mused. \u201cYou can get us in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I get invitations every day in the Congressman\u2019s office. It\u2019s just a matter of picking the\u2014\u201d She froze as a thought occurred to her. \u201cThe women all knew each other which means they probably all knew Lacey, too. Lacey\u2019s funeral,\u201d she finished on a whisper.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLacey\u2019s funeral,\u201d she repeated more certainly. \u201cThere were so many people there, but I only knew a few of them because they were all Lacey\u2019s friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have the pictures from Victor\u2019s files. Wouldn\u2019t you remember if any of these women had been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Emma said. \u201cI was pretty much in shock that whole night. If not for Duncan, I don\u2019t know what I would have done. I don\u2019t remember anyone, damnit.\u201d She thought furiously. \u201cWait, there was a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlen Pettry handled the funeral?\u201d Phoebe interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYes, he was the one who told me\u2014\u201d She stopped speaking because Phoebe had pulled a cell phone out of her pocket and was already punching in a number.</p><p>\u201cGlen,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cPhoebe Micheletti. How are you? He\u2019s good, grumpy as ever. Listen, do you have security cameras at your place? No. I understand. It\u2019s something we\u2019re working on, but we\u2019ll figure it out. Thanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>She clicked her phone off and dropped it into her pocket. \u201cNo joy. He has video, but only at the back entrance where the bodies come in because they arrive at all hours. The front entrance is more sensitive. No one wants to think they\u2019re being recorded at Aunt Tessie\u2019s funeral, and the funeral home\u2019s in a good neighborhood. Besides, Glen does a lot of business with vampires, and none of us want a record of our comings and goings.\u201d</p><p>Emma remained silent. There was another way of identifying who\u2019d been at the funeral, but she wasn\u2019t inclined to share it. She\u2019d already decided she didn\u2019t want to work with the pushy vampire anymore than she had to.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a good thought, though,\u201d Phoebe said. She stood and looked around. \u201cListen, if you do find these women, you need to let me deal with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should call\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to steal your thunder, Emma,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cWe\u2019re all after the same thing. Besides, Duncan wants you safe, and he\u2019s pretty bossy. He\u2019ll want one of us to follow up if you get a lead, and I can get a lot more information out of those women than you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s likely Victor messed with their memories,\u201d Phoebe interrupted again. \u201cNo matter how persuasive or sympathetic you are, they can\u2019t tell you what they don\u2019t remember. I\u2019ll be able to undo whatever Victor did and help them recall things they don\u2019t even realize they know.\u201d</p><p>Emma frowned. \u201cIf you say so,\u201d she agreed flatly.</p><p>Phoebe laughed again. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been around us long enough yet, but you\u2019ll be a believer soon enough. All right, I\u2019m out of here. It\u2019s a long way home for me. Louis has my number if you come up with anything, and I\u2019ll let you know if we get any hits on the facial recognition.\u201d She smiled and patted Emma\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t look so discouraged, Emma. It always starts this way.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her chair back into the table and looked over to where Louis was typing furiously. \u201cLouis,\u201d she called, waiting until he looked up, his expression a little vague, as if not quite in the now with the rest of them. \u201cI\u2019m out of here. I\u2019ll call if anything pops.\u201d He nodded and went immediately back to whatever he was doing, slapping away the hand of another vampire sitting next to him.</p><p>Phoebe smiled. \u201cChin up, Em,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Emma watched her go with a sour look. \u201cChin up, Em,\u201d she mimicked. She hated being called Em.</p><p>She waited until the annoying vampire was gone, even sticking her head into the hallway to be absolutely sure. And then she picked up her own phone and scrolled through the numbers. Pettry\u2019s was right on top since she\u2019d called him more than anyone else in the last few days. He answered after the second ring.</p><p>\u201cMister Pettry,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s Emma Duquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Duquet,\u201d he said warmly. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>She noticed he didn\u2019t ask her how she was. That particular social convention probably didn\u2019t work well in his business, since pretty much everyone he dealt with was miserable or they wouldn\u2019t be calling him.</p><p>\u201cThere was a mourner\u2019s book for Lacey\u2019s funeral, wasn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t give it to you, but you left rather suddenly, and there were still a few visitors for Ms. Cray\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Mister Pettry. I understand. Thank you for keeping it for me. I am sort of anxious to get a hold of it now, though. Do you suppose I could pick it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. At your convenience,\u201d Pettry said.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s late.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cVery late,\u201d she amended. \u201cAnd it\u2019s asking a lot, but I really need that book. Do you think I could pick it up tonight?\u201d She felt guilty even asking, but if Pettry did a lot of business with vampires, he must be used to having customers drop by in the middle of the night. And sure enough, her request didn\u2019t even faze him.</p><p>\u201cCertainly, I\u2019m here quite late every night. Just come around back and ring the bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mister Pettry, and thank you again for all your kindness during Lacey\u2019s service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pleased to be of assistance during this difficult time.\u201d</p><p>Emma disconnected. \u201cLouis, I need to run an errand,\u201d she said, already gathering her things.</p><p>Louis jumped up and came over. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe funeral home. I need to pick up the mourner\u2019s book. I think it\u2019ll help with this.\u201d She indicated her scattered notes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. I\u2019ll send one of our guys to pick it up for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Emma said pleasantly, unplugging her laptop and tucking it under her arm. \u201cI\u2019d rather do it myself, and I\u2019ll go straight home after that. I need to get up early tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan won\u2019t want you doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing Duncan\u2019s not my boss, then,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.</p><p>Emma picked up her notes and left before Louis could argue with her any further, stopping only long enough to gather her things from the frilly bedroom before heading downstairs. She glanced at her watch again, nearly groaning at the late hour. By the time she got out to Pettry\u2019s and back home again, it would be another night without much sleep. But a few cups of coffee would take care of that in the morning, and she figured she could sneak in some research in the office.</p><p>With the gym bag in one hand and her laptop back in the purse slung over her shoulder, she headed out to her car, only to find Baldwin waiting for her. He was a good-looking guy, or vampire. Shorter than she was by an inch or so, but he had scruffy dark hair, a five o\u2019clock shadow and probably outweighed her by fifty pounds, all of it muscle. He straightened as she came down the front stairs and immediately reached for her bags.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you home, Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my car. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll follow you.\u201d</p><p>Emma stopped and regarded him curiously. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBoss\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I in danger?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNot with me around.\u201d</p><p>Emma grinned back and informed him cheerfully, \u201cI\u2019m not going straight home. I need to stop at Pettry\u2019s Funeral Home outside Falls Church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a stop, that\u2019s a detour. We\u2019ll drop off your car first.\u201d</p><p>Emma shrugged. She didn\u2019t feel like fighting, and besides, it was a long drive. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He carried her bags to her car, waiting while she got settled behind the wheel, raising his eyebrows pointedly when she didn\u2019t immediately fasten her seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Baldwin, you\u2019re like a mother hen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like my job, Emma. I don\u2019t want anything happening to you on my watch.\u201d He closed her door and sped back to his SUV, then tailed her through the front gate and onto the street.</p> <p>It was a short and uneventful journey back to her house. She didn\u2019t live that far away in simple distance. It was traffic and street closures for the constant VIP convoys that made the trip longer during the day and evening. But this late at night, the streets were nearly empty. There were parties going on, but not in her part of town, so once they left Duncan\u2019s neighborhood, there wasn\u2019t even that to consider.</p><p>But when they got to her house, there was nowhere to park. With the end of winter, the street sweepers were back and everyone had moved their cars to one side of the street for the next morning\u2019s cleaning. She had to park a block over and two blocks down, and even then the space was barely large enough for her car. Good thing she was a good parallel parker.</p><p>Baldwin pulled up next to her and reached across to open the passenger door on his SUV. \u201cGet in,\u201d he called.</p><p>Emma grabbed her bags, tossed them into the SUV\u2019s backseat, and climbed in, gazing around happily. She liked riding in big trucks. She would have bought one for herself, but it wasn\u2019t practical in D.C. Maybe someday she\u2019d have a house in Virginia or Maryland, and she\u2019d have two vehicles\u2014a practical sedan for the ride into work, and a big ass SUV like this one for zooming around the countryside on weekends. She smiled, liking the idea.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you smiling at?\u201d Baldwin asked.</p> <p>\u201cI like your truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my truck. I\u2019m only the driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I like it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d let you drive, but Duncan wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019m a good driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but what about the other guy? My reflexes are faster than yours.\u201d</p> <p>As it turned out, Baldwin\u2019s reflexes were good for more than avoiding accidents. He drove like a bat out of hell, switching lanes and zooming into tight spaces that had Emma reaching down to check her seatbelt more than once. But they made terrific time, getting there much faster than she would have on her own.</p><p>Pettry was busy when she arrived\u2014she didn\u2019t want to inquire doing what this late at night\u2014but he\u2019d left a maroon, linen-covered box for her that held a similarly covered bound book with the words In Loving Memory gold-stamped on the front. Tears sprang to her eyes, and she closed the box quickly. This was going to be harder than she thought.</p><p>\u201cIs that everything, Emma?\u201d Baldwin asked quietly.</p><p>She nodded, not trusting her voice.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart. Let\u2019s get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>Emma clutched the box to her chest and followed the vampire back to the truck. He helped her up onto the high bench seat, not saying anything when she refused to let go of the box.</p><p>The drive back was just as fast, but much quieter. Emma was tired. She\u2019d been going all day, and it was nearly one o\u2019clock in the morning. She might even have dozed off a bit, because suddenly they were in front of her house. Emma blinked, then straightened and reached for her door handle, still clutching the memory book to her chest.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Baldwin said. He double-parked, turned off the engine and climbed out of the truck, circling around to her side to open her door. \u201cGet your keys out,\u201d he ordered.</p> <p>Emma didn\u2019t argue. She handed him the book, then twisted around to the backseat and shoved a hand into the zipper compartment on her bag. She dug out her keys and raised her hand, jingling them in the air where he could see them.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said and held out a hand to help her down. He gave the book back to her. \u201cGive me a minute to get your other stuff.\u201d</p><p>He closed her door and had reached for the back door of the SUV when his phone rang. He raised a finger, telling her to wait, and answered the phone. Emma could only hear his half of the conversation, but it was obviously one of the other vamps looking for something at the house. Everything was such a mess there. She didn\u2019t know how they kept track of it all. Baldwin tucked the phone between his chin and shoulder and opened the truck door. Emma shivered. There was a slight wind, and she was cold, despite her warm jacket. With a glance at Baldwin, who was reaching across the backseat, she went ahead and climbed the stairs to her house, thinking about nothing but getting inside and into her warm bed.</p><p>She slipped the key in the lock and pushed the door open. She heard Baldwin call, \u201cEmma, wait!\u201d And then several things happened all at once.</p><p>The shadows of her living room belched forth a big man, his eyes twin ovals of white in a dark-bearded face, his hands hard as he closed the few feet between them and grabbed her arm with one hand, while the other closed over her mouth.</p><p>In the same instant, her front door crashed open to slam against the wall, and Baldwin was there, twisting her away from the stranger and stepping between them so quickly that Emma stumbled and nearly fell. The man squawked as Baldwin\u2019s hand closed on his throat.</p><p>A gunshot rang out, and then another, startlingly loud in the confines of her small house. Baldwin grunted, staggered through the open doorway, and literally threw the invader away from the house, sending him flying past the SUV and into the street. The attacker shrieked, the sound cut off abruptly when he hit the hard pavement and rolled into the opposite gutter.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Baldwin rasped urgently.</p><p>She spun toward Baldwin, struck by something in his voice. He was slouched over, barely standing, one hand clutching his chest where . . . \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re bleeding! Are you shot?\u201d She grabbed him before he could fall over, slipping her shoulder under his arm and puffing out a gasp of air as his full weight fell on her all at once. With her arm around his waist, she gripped him tightly and all but dragged him out of the doorway and into the living room. She tried to get him to the couch, but he pushed away from her and dropped to the floor with a moan of pain, rolling over onto his back and staring up at her.</p><p>\u201cComputer,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cGet your bags in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\u2014\u201d Her eyes widened, and she raced back to the open SUV, grabbing her gym bag and purse with the laptop inside. She closed the truck door, then lugged her bags into the house, and slammed and locked that door, as well. Taking her phone from the table, she rushed over to Baldwin, falling to her knees next to him.</p><p>\u201cShould I call nine-one-one? Do you need an ambulance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiguel,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMy phone.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded as the blood in her body finally started routing to her brain once more and she could think clearly. Of course. Baldwin was a vampire. He wouldn\u2019t want the usual medical help. She put her phone aside. \u201cIs your phone in the truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPocket.\u201d</p><p>Emma looked down. He was wearing jeans and a pullover hoodie which was soaked with blood. She clenched her jaw, determined not to fall apart. Baldwin needed her. She patted his pockets rapidly, ignoring the blood, and found the phone tucked into the kangaroo pocket of his hoodie. She lifted it so Baldwin could see.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she asked. \u201cHow do I get Miguel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d Baldwin managed.</p><p>Emma did a quick survey of the phone and hit the first speed dial. It rang twice, and then an angry voice said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaldwin\u2019s been shot,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cTwice, I think. He\u2019s bleeding\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma. You\u2019ve got to hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house. Should I call an ambulance or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No! Don\u2019t call anyone. We\u2019re on our way. Five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Miguel, or at least she thought it was Miguel, hung up, and Emma scooted closer to Baldwin. Yanking her grandmama\u2019s afghan off the couch, she tucked it around him, then leaned forward, trying to share the warmth of her body, the comfort of her presence.</p><p>\u201cHang in there, Baldwin. Miguel\u2019s on the way.\u201d</p><p>But Emma was worried. He didn\u2019t look good. She didn\u2019t know much about vampire physiology, but she figured any creature with blood couldn\u2019t afford to lose too much of it, and he was losing a lot. His eyes were closed, his chest barely moved when he breathed, and . . .</p><p>\u201cBaldwin?\u201d she said urgently. No response.</p><p>She tightened her arms around him and started counting the seconds, waiting for each new breath, holding her own and hoping help arrived soon.</p><p>The slamming of heavy car doors, loud in the night, alerted her. Her head came up. She had time to remember that her door was locked and they couldn\u2019t get in, and then they burst into the house, breaking through the lock as if it was made of paper. Miguel was first, and Emma knew it was because he didn\u2019t trust her enough to send Duncan into an unknown situation on her word alone. And then Duncan was there, his eyes meeting hers, holding her gaze briefly before doing a quick scan of her body and back up again, as if to make certain she was okay.</p><p>Ari came in last. He closed the door and pulled the hall table in front of it. It wasn\u2019t a heavy table, but at least it held the door closed.</p><p>Miguel dropped to the floor, lifting away the afghan and tearing open Baldwin\u2019s clothes so he could see the vampire\u2019s chest. Emma moved aside, pulling the rest of the afghan with her.</p><p>\u201cEmma.\u201d Duncan\u2019s voice was steady and reassuring, calm despite the obvious crisis. She looked into his warm brown eyes, hoping to see something that would tell her Baldwin would be okay.</p><p>\u201cI need you to move,\u201d he said gently. \u201cBaldwin needs me.\u201d</p><p>She realized he\u2019d taken off the tuxedo jacket he\u2019d been wearing and was rolling up the sleeve of his white shirt. She scooted back, then stood, wanting to be out of the way, but also wanting to know what they were going to do. Why was Duncan baring his arms? If there was surgery to be done, wouldn\u2019t Miguel be the one\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her thoughts stuttered to a halt when Duncan produced a small, sharp knife and sliced into his forearm. Emma had never been one to faint, and she wasn\u2019t about to start now. But she\u2019d never seen a man cut open his own arm either, and it made her feel queasy. She leaned against the wall, but her gaze was riveted on the blood welling from Duncan\u2019s arm, an arm he now placed . . . Oh, of course. Baldwin needed blood to replace what he\u2019d lost, just like a regular human would. The difference was he could suck it through his fangs instead of needing an IV. Okay, no surprise there.</p><p>She drew a deep breath, and then held it, her eyes growing wide, as Miguel took the knife from Duncan and cut into Baldwin\u2019s chest. There was so much blood already that it hardly mattered, but it still made her lightheaded if she thought too much about actually sticking a knife into a man\u2019s chest and slicing him open like that. She shuddered and closed her eyes against the sight.</p><p>\u201cMiguel needs to get the bullet out,\u201d Duncan explained calmly. She opened her eyes and found him glancing back at her. His arm was still latched over Baldwin\u2019s mouth and the vampire was sucking noisily on it like a child with a pacifier. \u201cIt would work its way out by itself,\u201d Duncan continued, \u201cbut it\u2019s very close to his heart and we don\u2019t want to take that risk. The healing will also go much faster with it gone.\u201d</p> <p>Emma swallowed and took a careful step closer, curiosity winning out over squeamishness. She had a million questions she wanted to ask, but didn\u2019t want to disturb Miguel\u2019s concentration.</p><p>Duncan glanced back again and gave her a quick smile of approval that made her warm all over. Her reaction irritated her because she didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval, but she couldn\u2019t deny the way he made her feel either. She sighed inwardly and saw a smile cross Duncan\u2019s face. Since she knew he couldn\u2019t be smiling at Baldwin\u2019s open chest, it had to be something she\u2019d done. Which irritated her all over again.</p><p>\u201cThe bullet has damaged his lung,\u201d Duncan explained, focusing his gaze on the ongoing surgery. \u201cBut my blood can heal that. The heart is another matter. Too much damage can be fatal.\u201d</p><p>Miguel\u2019s gaze shot up to Duncan almost unwillingly, as if he was too shocked to control his reaction, and then his attention went right back down to the operation he was performing. Interesting. Maybe vampires didn\u2019t like to reveal the vulnerability Duncan had just admitted to her.</p><p>Suddenly Miguel stopped cutting and dug his fingers into Baldwin\u2019s chest, eventually coming up with a bloody bullet. Ari squatted down next to him and held out a hand for the slug, waiting until Miguel fished around and came up with a second one before wrapping them both in a piece of cloth and tucking them into his pocket.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a first aid kit?\u201d Miguel muttered without looking up.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Emma said quickly. She ran into the kitchen, dropping the afghan on the washing machine. She\u2019d have to soak it or the blood would never come out. She reached up to the cupboard over the machine and drew down the metal lunchbox-shaped first aid kit she\u2019d put together when they first moved in. She hurried back and knelt next to Miguel, placing the open kit between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d she asked with some pride. She\u2019d never used the kit before, but it was fully stocked.</p><p>\u201cAntibiotic spray if you have it, liquid if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She popped the top and handed him a fresh spray bottle of Bactine, thinking it would numb the pain, too. But then she glanced down at the gaping hole in Baldwin\u2019s chest and decided it would need a whole caseload of Bactine to numb it. Besides, Baldwin didn\u2019t seem to be in any pain. He was sucking happily on Duncan\u2019s arm, eyes closed, his expression showing no stress. He hadn\u2019t even groaned once, now that she thought about it.</p><p>\u201cCan he still get infected?\u201d she asked curiously, watching. \u201cI mean if Duncan\u2019s blood can heal all of this, can\u2019t it heal infection, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it can,\u201d Duncan replied. \u201cVampires in general are almost completely resistant to all types of infection. But with a wound this size, if we minimize the contamination, that\u2019s one less problem his vampire physiology will need to deal with and the wound will heal more quickly.\u201d</p><p>Miguel sprayed thoroughly, then handed the bottle back to her. \u201cBandages,\u201d he said. \u201cBig gauze pads or gauze wrap of some kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have both,\u201d she said immediately, knowing exactly what was in her kit.</p><p>Duncan and Miguel both gave her an odd look, probably wondering why a congressional legislative analyst would need such a complete first aid kit, and she obviously didn\u2019t. But when it had come time to buy one, the ready-made kits had seemed so puny that she\u2019d made her own and prepared for the worst. And maybe went a little overboard.</p><p>She unwrapped several large nonstick gauze pads and handed them to Miguel.</p><p>\u201cTape,\u201d he said, not even bothering to ask if she had it. \u201cCut me several pieces, eight or nine inches long.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded and began cutting tape, glad she\u2019d gone for the full size scissors instead of those crappy things that came in the regular kits. As she and Miguel taped up Baldwin\u2019s chest, Duncan finally pulled his wrist away from the vampire\u2019s mouth. Ari whipped out a clean white handkerchief and handed it to Duncan.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a bandage, too?\u201d she asked, giving Duncan an inquiring look.</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cNo, thank you, Emma.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, her eyes going wide as he wiped the blood from his wrist and she could see that it had already begun to heal.</p><p>\u201cTape!\u201d Miguel snarled.</p><p>She jumped, muttering, \u201cSorry,\u201d before handing him the next piece of tape.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Miguel said finally, sitting back on his heels. \u201cThat\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Duncan ran a comforting hand over Baldwin\u2019s forehead, brushing back his hair.</p><p>\u201cAri,\u201d he said, \u201cGet Baldwin back to the house. Miguel and I will follow with Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Ari acknowledged. He and Miguel lifted Baldwin carefully and took him out to the car, Miguel shoving the table aside while Ari carried him through the door.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Duncan said.</p><p>They were both still sitting on the floor, and she looked up from where she\u2019d been repacking her first aid kit.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes filled with inexplicable tears, as if now that the crisis was over, her body was giving her permission to react. She rubbed a hand over her eyes tiredly, brushing the tears away. \u201cThere was a man waiting for us, for me. He was already in the house when I opened the door. Baldwin was getting stuff out of the car and he told me to wait, but I was so cold. He, the attacker, I mean . . . he came at me the minute I opened the door, and he must have thought I was alone. But Baldwin . . .\u201d Her eyes widened suddenly. \u201cIs he still there? In the street? Baldwin threw him\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped talking because Duncan was up and out the door. She heard voices and ran over to the doorway to see what was happening. Ari was already driving away, but Duncan and Miguel were hunched over something in the street. Miguel stood, and she realized he was carrying her attacker over his shoulder. They walked over to a big, black SUV. Duncan pulled the hatch open and Miguel threw the man into the back, then reached in and did something to him. The man made no noise through all of this.</p><p>Miguel closed the hatch quietly and Duncan came back inside.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cBut he may soon wish he was. Put your things together, Emmaline. You\u2019re coming back to the house with us. It\u2019s not safe for you here.\u201d</p><p>Emma gave him a narrow look. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can leave from my house,\u201d Duncan said evenly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather stay here. All of my things are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen bring your things with you,\u201d he said deliberately. \u201cYou are not staying here alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am staying here,\u201d she insisted. The truth was if he had asked her, she would have agreed to go with him, because she really didn\u2019t want to stay here all alone, not when some new gun-toting asshole might show up at any minute. But he hadn\u2019t asked, had he?</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Duncan snapped. \u201cSomeone broke into this house and nearly killed Baldwin. You\u2019re being unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll go to a hotel.\u201d She saw a flash of hurt in his eyes, and her stubbornness drained away. \u201cFine,\u201d she snapped in turn. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. But you have to stop ordering me around, damnit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that,\u201d Duncan muttered. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked as she started past him toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pack my things,\u201d she said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He smiled, and she couldn\u2019t help it. She smiled back. \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d But he was already past her and up the stairs, heading for her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she called, racing after him. She came around the corner as he was reaching for her top drawer.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she said and hurried across the room. \u201cI\u2019ll pack myself, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the drawer?\u201d he asked innocently, but his eyes were dancing.</p><p>Emma regarded him carefully. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to distract me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried I\u2019m going to freak out about what happened and you\u2019re trying to distract me by threatening to play with my underwear.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cIs that what\u2019s in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, and you\u2019re avoiding the issue.\u201d</p><p>The grin vanished. He was suddenly perfectly serious as he reached out and rubbed his knuckles down her cheek. \u201cYou could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>Her chest tightened with emotion, her heart racing faster than it had all night. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see the gun. I just heard it when\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Duncan closed his eyes briefly, as if the thought of that bothered him even more.

It\u2019s not safe for you here until we find out who was behind this.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stepped back reluctantly. \u201cI won\u2019t take long,\u201d she said without looking at him.</p><p>He put a finger under her chin and lifted her face. \u201cTake as long as you want,\u201d he said seriously, then gave her a sly look. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want help with that drawer?\u201d</p><p>Emma chuckled weakly. \u201cNo, I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be downstairs. I have to talk to Miguel. Let me know when you\u2019re ready and we\u2019ll help with the bags.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan was controlled fury as he strode down the front steps of Emma\u2019s house and over to the SUV where Miguel waited with the dead man. Of course, the human wasn\u2019t dead yet, but he would be. As soon as he told them everything he knew.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Miguel said formally as Duncan approached.</p><p>\u201cDid Ari check in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. He just arrived at the house. Baldwin woke up when they carried him inside. He\u2019s not happy, but he\u2019s well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Duncan glanced through the back window at the unconscious human. \u201cIf he\u2019d wanted to kill her, he had the chance.\u201d</p><p>Miguel nodded. \u201cMaybe he was only supposed to scare her. Or maybe he had a message that he never got to deliver because Baldwin was there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a message, we\u2019ll know it,\u201d Duncan said darkly.</p><p>\u201cIf they know she\u2019s working with us, my lord., they\u2019ll come after her.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s rage soared and he fought to keep it from showing, but Miguel was aware of it anyway. He could tell from the watchful look on his lieutenant\u2019s face, the careful formality. The idea of anyone laying hands on Emma made him want to rip out the throats of every human in Victor\u2019s files, whether or not they\u2019d had a hand in Lacey\u2019s death. None of them were innocent, as far as he was concerned.</p><p>He forced himself to think calmly, something he found increasingly difficult when it came to Emma Duquet. But he couldn\u2019t afford to run around killing humans, whatever the reason. That was the very opposite of why he was in this corrupt city in the first place. Not that the men responsible for Lacey\u2019s death would be permitted to live. Oh, no. They were all going to die. Maybe not tonight, maybe not even soon. But eventually. And he would make sure they knew it, too. Every one of them would live the last few months of his life looking over his shoulder, waiting for death to find him.</p><p>The thought pleased him and he smiled slightly. \u201cHave someone set up a secure room at the house for the prisoner for when we get there,\u201d he said gesturing at the truck. \u201cSomewhere far from where Emma will be sleeping. The basement. Comfort isn\u2019t important. And brief the daylight guards, as well. I don\u2019t want a bungled rescue drawing in the human police, and I don\u2019t want him killed under our noses, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>They both turned when Emma appeared in her doorway, lugging a suitcase and carrying a garment bag over one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Duncan said impatiently. \u201cLet us help with that.\u201d</p> <p>She pushed the suitcase in his direction. \u201cYou take that and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lifted the suitcase and whipped the garment bag from her shoulder, handing them both to Miguel.</p><p>\u201cOkaaay,\u201d she drawled. \u201cWhat do I do about this door?\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned, then studied the doorframe. \u201cThe lock is broken, but the frame is sound. I don\u2019t suppose you have a hammer and nails . . .\u201d His voice trailed off as Emma disappeared back inside her house. \u201cOf course, you do,\u201d he amended.</p><p>She reappeared with the requested items and a smug grin.</p><p>\u201cNobody likes a know-it-all,\u201d he teased as she strolled past him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know it all,\u201d she replied breezily. \u201cI\u2019m just prepared for it all.\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed and picked up a hammer for the first time in more years than he could count.</p><p>Emma sat inside the warm SUV and watched as Duncan nailed her front door shut. It wasn\u2019t every day she saw a man in a tuxedo wielding a hammer. Of course, it wasn\u2019t every day some wacko tried to assault her in her home. Except that maybe the guy hadn\u2019t been a wacko. In a weird way, it would be reassuring if Lacey\u2019s killers had sent someone after her. It would mean she was on the right track.</p><p>She frowned. But, if that was the case, why didn\u2019t he kill her outright? He could have. Maybe he\u2019d planned something else entirely for her. Duncan and his vamps hadn\u2019t let her see all the details of what had gone on at Victor\u2019s so-called parties\u2014they were protecting her, which was infuriating in its own way\u2014but she had a good sense from what they had let her see, and the things she\u2019d overheard. It broke her heart to think of Lacey involved in all of that, and she shuddered for herself, thankful that Baldwin had been there tonight.</p><p>Duncan dropped the tools on the floor of the front seat, then joined Emma in the back. Miguel was driving since Ari had taken the smaller SUV with Baldwin in it. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a locksmith out here as soon as possible,\u201d Duncan said, as he closed the door. \u201cI\u2019ll have one of my people meet him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not until morning?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have human guards for daytime, Emma. They can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy car\u2019s around the block,\u201d she said, raising her voice to include Miguel, so he\u2019d know they had to stop. \u201cLeft here, then the next right,\u201d she added, then said to Duncan, \u201cI have to go to work tomorrow, er, I mean this morning. I have meetings, besides\u2014\u201d She stopped herself, thinking it would probably be better if Duncan didn\u2019t know about her plans to continue tracking down the women from Victor\u2019s parties during the day tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cBesides what?\u201dDuncan asked, eyeing her curiously.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose my job,\u201d she said lamely. She blushed with the lie, but hoped he would assume she was embarrassed because of her implied money shortage. Besides, it really wasn\u2019t a lie. She couldn\u2019t afford to lose her job.</p><p>Duncan looked at her, his expression carefully blank, and she knew he sensed something was off. He couldn\u2019t know precisely what she was lying about, but she was pretty sure he knew she wasn\u2019t telling him the whole truth either.</p><p>When they reached her car, Emma started to jump out, but Duncan put a hand on her arm to delay her. \u201cI\u2019ll ride with Emma, Miguel.\u201d</p><p>Up front, Miguel\u2019s head snapped up and he twisted around to give Duncan a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cYou can drive behind us,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that far.\u201d</p><p>Miguel stared at Duncan for a heavy moment and then he nodded. \u201cYes, Sire,\u201d he said, the respectful words tight with anger.</p><p>Emma glanced at Duncan, hoping she wasn\u2019t going to get stuck between two angry vampires, but Duncan\u2019s expression was as calm and controlled as ever. He held Miguel\u2019s stare until the other vampire looked away, then he turned that cool gaze on her and gestured to the door. \u201cIf you would, Emma,\u201d he said.</p><p>Emma scrabbled for the door handle, shoved the door open and stepped out into the cold air. It should have been bracing after the warmth of the SUV, but she shivered, and exhaustion rolled over her like a thick blanket. God, she was tired. How long had it been since she\u2019d slept? And she had to go to work in a few short hours, had to make it look as if she was moving on from Lacey\u2019s death, doing her job, maybe finding a smaller place to live. But certainly not spending her nights wide awake and searching for the killer, who might very well have an office in the next building, or even just down the hall.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s hand came over hers, slipping the keys from her numb fingers. \u201cGet in the car. I\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you can. But I\u2019ll drive anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy,\u201d she muttered, stomping around to the passenger seat. \u201cPhoebe said you\u2019d be bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well\u2014\u201d He slid behind the wheel and started the car. \u201cPhoebe isn\u2019t exactly a pushover herself.\u201d</p><p>Emma turned the heat on its highest setting, and Duncan immediately adjusted the vents in her direction.</p><p>\u201cIs her husband a vampire, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Most vampire matings are with humans. Sharing blood is intensely sexual. I\u2019ve seen one or two m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois that worked, two vampires and one human, but that\u2019s rare.\u201d</p><p>Emma felt her own blood heat as she pictured Duncan\u2019s mouth on her neck, his upper body naked, gleaming with sweat the way he\u2019d been in the gym earlier. She reached out and turned the heat down, unzipping her jacket.</p><p>Duncan glanced at her. \u201cToo warm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think\u2014\u201d She coughed slightly. \u201cThis heater starts slow, but once it gets going, it\u2019s a bit much.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s sinful mouth curved slightly, but he never took his eyes off the road.</p><p>What she wouldn\u2019t give to see him rattled, to break that ever-present cool of his. Just once. She didn\u2019t want anything awful to happen. She just wanted to shake him up a little and see what tumbled out. She had a passing thought, wondering if he was in control in bed the way he was everywhere else. And then her eyes went wide, shocked at her own thoughts. Obviously, she\u2019d been working too hard for too long. All work and no play apparently made Emma a very horny girl. She swallowed a laugh, biting the inside of her cheek so the all-seeing Duncan wouldn\u2019t notice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they pulled through the gate of the vampires\u2019 big house, it was nearly four in the morning. Emma considered not even going to sleep, but there wasn\u2019t enough coffee in the city to keep her awake all night and all day, too.</p><p>They didn\u2019t park out front, but drove around to the back of the house. Several motion detector lights flooded the area as soon as they pulled into it, making it almost as bright as daylight. Vampire guards appeared out of the shadows, some of them whipping sunglasses on to shield their eyes. Miguel did the same, his eyes covered by nearly black wraparound lenses when he emerged from the SUV. He spoke to one of the other vampires, then strode over and opened the driver\u2019s door of her sedan, which looked small and tattered next to the line of gleaming SUVs.</p><p>\u201cThe prisoner will be secure in the basement, my lord,\u201d he said as Duncan slid out from behind the wheel. \u201cAlaric has constructed a stockade.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd enjoyed doing it, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. He did comment that it had been years, and he hoped he remembered the proper ratio of bar tension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the prisoner alive, Miguel, not strangled to a slow death. Not until after I question him anyway.\u201d</p><p>Emma gave him a startled look. What would they do with their prisoner after they\u2019d questioned him? The vampires seemed to avoid any contact with human police, but they couldn\u2019t just let the man go, either. She frowned. For that matter, what would they do with Lacey\u2019s killer when they found him\u2014or them?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking, Emma?\u201d Duncan asked, his voice right next to her ear.</p> <p>She jumped, scowling at him. \u201cWe need to put a bell on you.\u201d</p><p>Duncan simply smiled and placed his hand at the small of her back, urging her toward the door. \u201cYou could try. I\u2019d probably enjoy it . . . the trying part, that is.\u201d He opened the door and held it for her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he continued, as they walked through a large kitchen. \u201cWhat had you frowning so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean besides you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded easily. \u201cBesides me.\u201d</p><p>Emma considered making something up, but she really needed an answer on this one. \u201cWhat will you do when we find them? The men who killed Lacey?\u201d</p> <p>They had reached the foyer below the stairs by then, and Duncan stopped, turning to face her. \u201cIt is the policy of the vampire community to work with the human police and authorities at all times,\u201d he said blandly. It sounded rehearsed and Emma knew she was hearing the party line.</p><p>She met his perfectly human-looking eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask what the policy was, Duncan. These are powerful men. If you turn them in to the authorities, they\u2019ll be back on the streets in hours not days. I want to know what you\u2019ll actually do when you catch them.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a long moment, then said, \u201cThe interests of the vampire community always come first.\u201d She opened her mouth to demand he answer her question, but he forestalled her, saying, \u201cThere are some secrets we vampires never share. I have reason to believe Victor was . . . indiscreet, shall we say, with regard to certain of these secrets. Such knowledge, particularly in the hands of men such as these, represents a threat to my people, and I do not tolerate threats to my people.\u201d</p><p>Emma listened, hearing not just the words, but what he was trying to tell her. She nodded. \u201cSo you\u2019ll eliminate the threat,\u201d she said, wanting to be perfectly clear.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no problem with that,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>His brown eyes sparkled. \u201cI am relieved.\u201d</p><p>Emma rolled her eyes, then gazed up in dismay at the many stairs between her and a comfortable bed.</p> <p>\u201cI could carry you,\u201d Duncan said seriously.</p><p>She smiled regretfully. \u201cThanks. But I have a feeling I\u2019d never live it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he said, placing a hand under her elbow and lending his considerable strength as they started up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI was talking about you.\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed out loud, then swept her into his arms and raced up the stairs. Before she\u2019d even caught her breath, they were in the bedroom she\u2019d used earlier and he was setting her on the floor, sliding her down his body so she felt every inch of hard muscle in his chest, his thighs. She caught her breath. His muscles weren\u2019t the only thing that was hard about him.</p><p>Emma glanced up and found her gaze caught by the bronze glow of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes,\u201d she whispered, raising her hand to trace the curve of his brow. \u201cThey\u2019re glowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do that,\u201d Duncan murmured, his strong fingers flexing over her hips.</p><p>\u201cBut not all the time,\u201d Emma said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhen I use my power,\u201d Duncan explained, one hand swooping almost to the curve of her ass as he tugged her closer. \u201cOr when strong emotion comes into play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotion,\u201d Emma repeated softly, her fingers now playing along the softness of his mouth. \u201cLike . . . desire?\u201d She raised up and planted a quick kiss on his mouth. \u201cLust?\u201d Another kiss. \u201cWant?\u201d</p><p>She again raised up, intending to give him another quick kiss, but he growled, holding her in place as he deepened the kiss into something hot and demanding. One hand rode up her back, his fingers twisting in her hair as he shifted the angle of their kiss, going deeper as his tongue delved into her mouth.</p><p>Emma moaned softly. He tasted of hot nights and dark secrets, though she couldn\u2019t have explained what that meant. She just knew it was true. She wanted more. She wanted to bite his lips, to taste more of him. She reached behind his head and tugged the tie off his blond hair, shoving her fingers into the warm thickness of it, scraping her nails along his scalp.</p><p>Duncan snarled against her mouth, and Emma felt something hard and sharp. Her heart raced as she realized what it had to be. Fangs. She ran her tongue along their slick smoothness, and Duncan\u2019s answering groan shivered through every cell of her body. Emma pushed harder, crushing her mouth against his. It was as if she couldn\u2019t get close enough, couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She felt a sharp prick on her tongue, tasted her own blood, warm and coppery.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s fingers clenched in her hair, holding her so tightly it brought tears to her eyes, but she didn\u2019t cry out, didn\u2019t move as his tongue swept over hers, licking up every last drop. His erection, already a long, hard presence against her belly, grew impossibly harder, straining against the clothing that separated them. Emma fisted a hand in Duncan\u2019s shirt when he broke their kiss, pulling him back to her with a small, hungry moan as she took his mouth once more.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he murmured, then swore softly when she nipped his lower lip angrily. She didn\u2019t break the skin, but it had to hurt anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she snapped, her body screaming at her to get him naked now!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said, his strong hands on her arms holding her away from his body when all she wanted to do was rub up against him like a cat.</p><p>\u201cLate?\u201d she repeated. \u201cLate for what?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Duncan laughed, twisting away when she punched his gut in retaliation.</p><p>\u201cStop laughing and tell me what\u2019s going on, you stupid vamp\u2014\u201d Realization struck. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Duncan rubbed his abdomen, as if her fist had actually done any damage to those rock hard muscles of his. He played it for all it was worth, though, until she rolled her eyes in mock disgust.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long is it until sunrise?\u201d she asked, staring up at him and letting her desire show in her eyes.</p><p>Duncan groaned softly. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is hard enough.\u201d</p><p>Emma grinned wickedly at the probably unintended double entendre, but, of course, he knew what she was grinning at.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bad,\u201d he said. He let his hands run down her back to cup her ass, pulling her close enough to feel precisely how hard it was. \u201cJust over an hour,\u201d he murmured against her ear. \u201cAnd Emmaline, my sweet, when I finally get to make love to you, I\u2019m going to need much longer than that.\u201d</p><p>Emma was suddenly glad he was holding onto her, because the wave of lust she felt at those murmured words would have knocked her off her feet. This was so unfair.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d Her voice broke and she coughed slightly. \u201cWhat are you doing tomorrow? I mean at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here all night,\u201d he whispered, his breath warm against her skin as he kissed the tender spot just in front of her ear, then deposited a line of soft kisses over to her mouth.</p><p>Emma stretched upward, but he placed one final, hard kiss on her lips and stepped back. \u201cYou be careful today, Emma,\u201d he said seriously, brushing her hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d he continued, then pressed a chaste kiss against her forehead. \u201cAnd you should get whatever sleep you can. You\u2019re going to need it later.\u201d He winked, then spun around and strolled out to the hall and away.</p><p>Emma stared at the empty doorway, her body thrumming with unmet need. \u201cDammit,\u201d she whispered, then reached out and closed the door firmly. The only lock was the one on the knob, which wouldn\u2019t keep out a vampire. But she didn\u2019t really expect anyone to disturb her. She glanced around the room restlessly, then checked her watch. If she went to sleep immediately, she could manage two hours at the most before she had to get up and go to work. But the odds of falling asleep right away were zero point zero thanks to a certain vampire. What was the male version of a cock tease anyway? She\u2019d have to look that up later. For now she resigned herself to a caffeine fueled day and opened her suitcase.</p><p>A few hours later, Emma was wearing her uniform of power suit and heels, strolling down the marbled halls of Washington. Well, okay, she wasn\u2019t actually strolling; that would have been too obvious. She hurried, just like everyone else did in this building, rushing about, sometimes with a pack of reporters and cameramen trailing after them, as if the fate of the world rested on their shoulders. She supposed sometimes that was true, but it was nowhere near as often as the politicians liked to think it was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was crowded this morning. Yet another congressional meeting on something earth shattering like baseball players using steroids. People starving all over the world, dying on battlefields, hacked to death by their neighbors, and the most pressing thing the leaders of the free world could think of was a bunch of big-headed, small-balled athletes using steroids. Who cared? Not Emma, although her male colleagues had insisted it mattered. She was just glad Congressman Coffer wasn\u2019t on any of the relevant committees. She didn\u2019t think she could have kept a straight face, or kept her mouth shut.</p><p>She desperately grabbed a cup of coffee on her way to her desk, and managed not to spill it while juggling her bag with the laptop and Lacey\u2019s memorial book inside. She\u2019d left the box in her room at Duncan\u2019s. It was too bulky for even her giant purse.</p><p>She\u2019d barely managed to take a few sips of precious caffeine and skim over the relevant files for the morning\u2019s meeting, when the Congressman\u2019s door opened and her colleagues jumped up to head into the office. Emma followed more slowly, marveling that only a few days ago, she would have been every bit as pumped up as the others about tomorrow\u2019s hearing. But this morning it was nothing but a distraction. What she wanted to do was sit down with her computer and follow up her new idea about how to identify the women from Victor\u2019s parties.</p> <p>It was past noon when she had the chance, however. The meeting had run long, and then there\u2019d been a pile of constituent requests for her to wade through. Most had been shuffled to other staff members right away, but a few had been of a more serious nature and she\u2019d had to deal with them herself.</p><p>But finally the office was nearly empty, with everyone off to lunch somewhere. Washington took its lunches very seriously, seeing them as one more opportunity to court votes or raise money or sometimes just to have a couple of martinis and stop the shaking for an hour or two. Emma grabbed a leftover muffin from the morning. It was cranberry, the runt of the litter, crushed and disreputable looking, which was probably the only reason it was still there. She took it and yet another cup of coffee back to her desk, pulled up the list of women\u2019s initials from Victor\u2019s files and began going through Lacey\u2019s mourner\u2019s book looking for names. She was initially surprised at the number of people who had signed the book. She\u2019d been in such a fog, and she\u2019d had no idea that many people had come. Some had simply signed their names, but most had written at least a few words of condolence, and a very few had done more than that. It was an effort not to get lost in their remembrances as she read the words of people she didn\u2019t know, but who had known Lacey and would miss her. It reminded her of why she was reading the book at all, so she wiped away her tears and began searching the pages more methodically.</p><p>She was bent over trying to decipher some of the handwriting when a door opened and Guy Coffer\u2019s surprised voice said, \u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>Emma jumped, nearly choking on a piece of muffin. She grabbed her coffee and took a long sip, thankful it had sat there long enough to be only warm.</p><p>\u201cCongressman,\u201d she managed finally, coughing.</p> <p>Coffer gave her a worried look, his hand outstretched, as if he was thinking about patting her on the back. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, concerned. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d</p><p>Emma took another sip of coffee and waved a hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, setting the cup down. She spun her chair around, bracing a hand on her desk and surreptitiously hitting the hot key on her laptop which would shut down her files.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were here,\u201d she said cautiously.</p><p>Coffer gave her his handsome politician\u2019s grin. \u201cI walked through earlier. You were hard at work.\u201d</p><p>Emma was slightly alarmed by the idea that he could have passed by without her noticing. Then she glanced around and felt a new kind of worry. The phones were ringing almost constantly, as usual, and she could hear people in the outer office, but other than that she and Coffer were alone. If Sharon walked in right now, she\u2019d stroke out, and maybe fire Emma. Shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hear you. Was there something\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. You\u2019re entitled to lunch just like the rest of us. I came out to get a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty low. Let me make some fresh.\u201d Emma closed the cover on her laptop and jumped up, hurrying over to the coffeemaker on the side cabinet. There was a bigger setup out front, but venturing to the outer office sometimes meant being ambushed by someone wanting something, so the analysts working in this part of the office tended to use this one. Everyone was supposed to do their part to keep the pot full, but as always, there were those who shirked the duty, thinking it beneath them. Emma wasn\u2019t one of those. She valued her coffee too much.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d Coffer asked, glancing at the mourner\u2019s book which lay open on Emma\u2019s desk.</p><p>Emma forced herself to stay calm, waiting until she\u2019d filled the coffeemaker and flipped the switch, before turning to face him. \u201cThat\u2019s the condolence book from Lacey\u2019s funeral,\u201d she told him, letting her real emotions flavor her words. \u201cSo many friends came to say good-bye to Lacey, people I didn\u2019t even know.\u201d She paused, glancing out the window, noticing the winter\u2019s accumulation of dirt on the glass.</p><p>\u201cWere you and Lacey very close?\u201d he asked, and his eyes were so sad that Emma stared at him for a moment before nodding.</p><p>\u201cLacey was like a sister to me. The only family I had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>Emma knew Coffer was a skilled politician, but he seemed so sincere that she couldn\u2019t help giving him a reassuring smile. \u201cEveryone tells me it will get better with time. I\u2019m not sure I believe that, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re right, you know,\u201d he interrupted intently. \u201cThe day I learned my brother had died overseas was the worst day of my life. One moment he was here, and the next he was gone. The pain of losing him . . . it\u2019s still there, but not as much as it used to be. Sometimes I feel guilty about that, but I think it\u2019s the way our minds cope with such a terrible loss. Otherwise, we\u2019d go mad.\u201d</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t know what to say. She was quite literally overwhelmed by his kindness. \u201cThank you,\u201d she managed. \u201cThat was very kind.\u201d</p><p>Coffer ducked his head, smiling. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get so serious. If that coffee\u2019s ready\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Emma said, thankful for the break. Things had gotten a little too intense there for a moment. She fixed a cup for him, two sugars the way everyone knew he liked it. Just like everyone knew Sharon always made it with a sugar substitute instead.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, giving her a conspiratorial wink. \u201cI\u2019ll get out of your hair now. Finish your . . .\u201d He glanced around her at the remains of her muffin. \u201cMuffin?\u201d he said, then smiled and strolled back to his office.</p><p>Emma practically fell back into her chair, her nerves still jumping at the shock of having Coffer walk up on her like that. Sure, her desk was in the distant corner and when she was working, her back was to his office, but even so . . . She shook her head. She might make a great investigator\u2014no, she was a great investigator. Give her a problem, she worked it like a dog with a bone. It was what made her a terrific legislative analyst, too. But apparently, she wasn\u2019t cut out for sneaking around. Shaking her head, she opened her computer and went back to work, making a point of angling her chair so her back wasn\u2019t entirely to the room. She didn\u2019t want any more surprise visitors.</p><p>She was actually down to the last few pages of condolences. She\u2019d been so certain it would be the definitive data source, that all of the women would somehow magically appear within its pages. But so far, she had only one possible name, and that one was doubtful. Victor\u2019s files had listed a V.S. as one of his women, but the only matching entry in the book was a V. Slayton. No name, just the initial, and the handwriting gave her no clue as to whether it was a man or a woman. Discouraged, she turned to the last page and saw the name Tammy Dietrich. And Victor had a T.D. on his list. Her stomach tightened with excitement. Maybe she\u2019d been right all along and this was the break she\u2019d been looking for.</p><p>A cluster of voices sounded in the outer office, announcing the return of at least some of her colleagues. She closed the mourner\u2019s book, her fingers rubbing the soft cover thoughtfully. Ever since they\u2019d found Lacey\u2019s body, she\u2019d had this feeling that there was a big clock ticking away the seconds and very soon it would be too late. The powerful men involved were already working to cover their asses so thoroughly that no one would ever see those pale, white globes again. She wrinkled her nose at the image her own thoughts conjured up, but it was a halfhearted reaction. Because the truth of that thought was undeniable. They needed some progress on this investigation before the men responsible erased every hint of their involvement. Emma only needed to ID one of Victor\u2019s women, someone who\u2019d been there, who could name names.</p><p>She didn\u2019t give herself any time to change her mind. She grabbed her notes, shoved her laptop into her purse and left the office before anyone who mattered was there to notice. She wanted to follow up on Tammy Dietrich and the V.S. person, too, and was pretty sure she knew someone who could help her.</p><p>She rushed out into the chilly afternoon of the Capitol parking lot, tugging her coat closed. Last year, it had been warm by this time of year. People had even complained about the mall\u2019s famous cherry blossoms peaking too soon. Not this year. She gave the gray sky a wary glance. It couldn\u2019t actually snow anymore, could it?</p><p>She unlocked her car and slipped inside gratefully, turning the heater on full blast. While she waited for the car\u2019s interior to warm up, she called Lacey\u2019s old office, breathing a sigh of relief when the voice that answered was one she knew well.</p><p>\u201cBetty,\u201d Emma said. \u201cIt\u2019s Emma Duquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Betty Napoli responded, her smoker\u2019s voice warm with sympathy. \u201cHow are you, hon?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, I guess. It\u2019s been rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, child. We all miss Lacey. She was such a lively little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Emma said quietly. \u201cShe was special.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe sure was. How can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m writing thank you notes. You know, to the people who sent flowers, the ones at the memorial service, too. I have the book you all signed, but I don\u2019t know some of these people, and I thought maybe you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know me, and I know everyone else. Who do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust two right now. A ...\u201d she paused as if checking her list. \u201cTammy Dietrich? I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s hard to read some of these signatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Tammy Dietrich I know right away. In fact, let me give you her address.\u201d</p> <p>Emma scrambled to find a pen as Betty rattled off the office address of a law firm she\u2019d never heard of. Not that this was a great surprise. Lawyers littered the capital like trash after a parade, and she ought to know since she was one of them.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s the other?\u201d Betty asked.</p><p>Emma had found a pen, gotten it to work and was trying to catch up with Betty\u2019s recitation of the address. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d she said absently.</p><p>\u201cThe other name,\u201d Betty said patiently. \u201cYou said there were two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. I\u2019m sorry. The damn pen didn\u2019t work right away. Yes, the other one is something Slayton, I think. The first initial is V, as in . . . Victor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlayton,\u201d Betty repeated thoughtfully. \u201cSlayton. You know, I think she worked here for a bit. Only a month or two, which is why I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s the one. I don\u2019t know that she and Lacey would have met, but . . . yes, here she is. Violet. That\u2019s a lovely name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Betty mused briefly. \u201cViolet Slayton. I don\u2019t know where she went when she left here, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a home address?\u201d Emma inquired, knowing that even if Betty had it, she couldn\u2019t give it out.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, I do. But you know how they are about things like that. I\u2019ll tell you what, though. We were talking, and I think she mentioned her family was from Springfield, Virginia. Had a place on Donset. We remarked on it, because I have some friends out that way. Might be a place to start.\u201d</p><p>Emma wrote down the city name and smiled. Without actually telling her anything, Betty was saying that Violet Slayton was living with her parents in Springfield. With that plus the street name, she could find Slayton easily.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Betty,\u201d she said sincerely. \u201cI really appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. It was a terrible thing what happened to Lacey. So young . . .\u201d Her voice cracked a little and she sniffed discreetly. \u201cYou let me know if you need anything else, you hear, Emma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Emma said, feeling her own chest tighten with emotion. \u201cThanks again.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to dwell on the reminder of how much she missed Lacey, Emma clicked off and immediately opened her laptop. Still sitting in the parking lot, she was close enough that she could access her office Wi-Fi. She checked out Tammy Dietrich first, because that was easiest. The address Betty had given her was in Alexandria, Virginia, but chances were Dietrich was a member of the D.C. bar, as well. Even Emma was licensed to practice in D.C., and she had no intention of ever standing before a court here. It was just something one did if working in or near the District, especially if one was as compulsively organized as Emma. If nothing else, it gave her access to things like the bar association membership directory, which came in handy at times like today. She typed in Dietrich\u2019s name. There was no picture, which wasn\u2019t that unusual. Emma didn\u2019t have one with her listing, either. There actually wasn\u2019t much information for Dietrich at all, just her law school alma mater, which was Georgetown, and the business address that Betty had already given her. Dietrich\u2019s was the only name listed for the firm, which probably meant she had a private practice, maybe with one or two other lawyers.</p><p>Still, the Alexandria address was very pricey. She was either doing very well for herself, or she came from money.</p> <p>Emma called up a map and decided to at least drive by and check out Dietrich\u2019s office. Maybe she\u2019d walk in and ask for directions, just to get a look around. Chances were that since she didn\u2019t know Dietrich, Dietrich didn\u2019t know her either. Besides, she probably wouldn\u2019t get past the front desk anyway.</p><p>Alexandria was close enough that under normal circumstances, it would have been faster to take a cab, or even the bus. But Emma still hoped to get out to Violet Slayton\u2019s house this afternoon, and she couldn\u2019t afford to waste the time it would take to track back to the Capitol parking lot for her car. She sighed. It was going to cost a fortune to park in Alexandria.</p><p>Emma lucked out and caught a parking space a couple doors down from Dietrich\u2019s office. It was only a ten minute slot, but she already knew it wouldn\u2019t take any more time than that to check Tammy Dietrich off her list. For one thing, Dietrich was listed as a partner on the discreet plaque outside the door of the office building. Victor\u2019s taste in women for his parties leaned more toward secretaries than law partners. And for another, the law offices were located in an Old Alexandria brownstone, which screamed money and lots of it. This was almost certainly a dead-end, but since she was already here, she would check it out anyway.</p><p>The receptionist looked up when Emma approached the desk. The woman was maybe ten years older than Emma and dressed far better. She was doing her best to look down her nose, even though she was looking up through a pair of very traditional tortoiseshell glasses.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Emma said, pretending to read the several pieces of paper she\u2019d folded and now carried in her hand, as if for reference. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to meet some friends at . . .\u201d she peered at the papers, \u201cWaterfront Park, and I can\u2019t seem to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the water,\u201d the receptionist said frostily, with a heavy dose of my God you\u2019re stupid thrown in for good measure. \u201cThe water is that way,\u201d she added, pointing with one perfectly manicured finger in a direction that just happened to be out the office door.</p><p>Emma gave her a friendly smile. \u201cWell, of course it is. Where\u2019s my brain this afternoon? You\u2019ve been very kind,\u201d she added, although it wasn\u2019t true. Robots had more human kindness than this woman. But Emma didn\u2019t need any warm fuzzies. She\u2019d already gotten what she came here for. On the wall behind the frigid receptionist\u2019s desk were professional portraits of Tammy Dietrich and her law partner. And Tammy Dietrich was most definitely not one of Victor\u2019s playthings. Emma didn\u2019t have names for the women in Victor\u2019s peep show videos, but she definitely had faces. And Dietrich wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t waste any more pleasantries on the unfriendly receptionist. She left the office and hurried back to her car with two minutes to spare on the meter. It hadn\u2019t been a total waste of time. She hadn\u2019t found one of the women on Victor\u2019s list, but at least she\u2019d eliminated Dietrich. That was something. Not much, but something. And she still had Violet Slayton, who definitely had worked with Lacey.</p><p>Emma pulled her laptop over and piggybacked onto someone\u2019s unsecured Wi-Fi connection. She logged onto her office network and accessed a listing of households in the Springfield, Virginia area. Using Slayton\u2019s last name and the street name Betty had given her, she soon had the address of Violet Slayton\u2019s parents. She clicked over to her favorite map site, typed in the address, and scrutinized the directions. She nodded to herself. She could definitely get out there and back to Duncan\u2019s place before his one hour after sunset deadline.</p><p>She had a fleeting thought that Duncan wouldn\u2019t be too happy about her going to see Slayton without him. Especially after her armed intruder last night. But they didn\u2019t know for sure yet that the guy last night had anything to do with Victor. He might simply have been a burglar caught in the act. And, even if someone was keeping track of her investigations, they\u2019d hardly be following her every move. She hadn\u2019t known herself that she\u2019d be driving out to Virginia this afternoon, so how could anyone else know? Besides, Violet Slayton could turn out to be as big a dead end as Tammy Dietrich. The men responsible for Lacey\u2019s death were probably sitting back and laughing as Emma raced around, chasing shadows.</p><p>She sent the directions to Slayton\u2019s house to her cell phone, then started her car and pulled away only seconds ahead of the parking meter guy.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Violet Slayton was as nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs, as Emma\u2019s Grandmama had been known to say. Slayton was pale and too thin, but Emma had the impression these were both recent developments. Her clothes were too big, and her skin had that parched look of someone who wasn\u2019t eating or hydrating properly. But none of that, not the clothes and not her pallor, could conceal the fact that she was beautiful. Her eyes were deep brown and luminous, surrounded by long, black lashes, and her dirty hair was thick and wavy. Violet reminded Emma of the women she\u2019d met while doing an internship at a rape crisis center during law school. The thought of what could have made Violet react that way had Emma\u2019s blood running cold, and she knew she\u2019d done the right thing by coming out here.</p><p>\u201cI was sorry to hear about Lacey,\u201d Violet said, settling into the corner of a large, overstuffed couch. She spoke so quietly Emma had to lean closer to hear. It was as if Violet was afraid someone would overhear, even though Emma knew there was no one in the house but the two of them. Slayton hugged herself, wrapping her too big sweater nearly double around her body. \u201cLacey was a good person. Brave. I felt I had to go to the service, had to pay my respects, even though\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly, and her beautiful eyes were filled with fear when they flashed up to stare at Emma.</p><p>\u201cEven though what, Violet?\u201d Emma asked gently.</p><p>Violet looked away. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone since I left the firm. I left kind of suddenly. I didn\u2019t give them proper notice, and they weren\u2019t happy with me. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d see anyone I knew at the funeral. I didn\u2019t want to see anyone, but . . . Lacey was kind. I couldn\u2019t let them . . .\u201d Her mouth tightened, her lips rolling under until they disappeared entirely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou said Lacey was brave,\u201d Emma said quietly. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>Violet stared down at her fingers, which played with a leather button on her sweater, rolling it first one way, then the next. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t afraid of anyone,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt was as if she didn\u2019t believe the world could hurt her.\u201d Violet looked up suddenly, meeting Emma\u2019s gaze. \u201cBut she was wrong, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded, letting her own sorrow show. \u201cLacey was the only family I had,\u201d she said, without knowing why. \u201cThere\u2019s a place inside of me, right next to my heart, that hurts all the time since she\u2019s been gone. I don\u2019t think it will ever stop hurting, but I know it won\u2019t until I find out what really happened to Lacey.\u201d</p> <p>Violet gave her a startled glance. \u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d Realization bloomed in her eyes, and she lost what little color she had. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cYou went to the parties with Lacey, didn\u2019t you, Violet?\u201d Emma asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk about this. I won\u2019t.\u201d Violet shook her head, once again refusing to look at Emma. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything anyway.\u201d</p><p>Emma watched the other woman, hating herself for being here, for forcing Violet Slayton to relive even the smallest part of whatever had happened to her. But those men were still out there. And they deserved to pay for what they\u2019d done, to Lacey certainly, but to Violet and the others as well. And to some other woman in the future if they weren\u2019t stopped.</p><p>\u201cLacey was murdered,\u201d she told Violet bluntly, taking a huge chance. \u201cI let everyone think it was a car accident because I don\u2019t trust the police to handle it. The men who killed her have too much money and power, and those things talk in this town.\u201d</p> <p>Violet was staring at her again, shaking her head. \u201cI can\u2019t help you. He did something so I wouldn\u2019t remember. It\u2019s the one decent . . .\u201d She laughed bitterly and ran a hand back through her dirty hair. \u201cAs bad as this looks, it\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you having flashbacks?\u201d Emma asked, remembering the rape victims she\u2019d talked to back in college. \u201cNightmares? Bits and pieces of things that make no sense, but terrify you anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse,\u201d Violet whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s worse because they make no sense. Sometimes I think if I could only put the pieces together and make sense of it all, it would finally go away. But then I\u2019m afraid of what I\u2019ll discover if I ever get that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d Emma said. \u201cLet my friends help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends? What friends?\u201d Violet said, suddenly suspicious. \u201cNot one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d</p> <p>Violet\u2019s breathing shallowed until she was almost panting. \u201cVampires,\u201d she breathed. \u201cThey exist, you know,\u201d she said defiantly, as if assuming Emma wouldn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>Emma nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Violet blinked. \u201cYou believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve been to the vampires\u2019 residence, the embassy. I know about Victor, and I know what he did.\u201d Emma leaned forward earnestly. \u201cVictor is dead, Violet. He can\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead?\u201d Violet whispered in disbelief. Her eyes filled with tears and she raised a trembling hand to her mouth. \u201cDead,\u201d she repeated. Her gaze flashed up to meet Emma\u2019s. \u201cThen you don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d Emma said softly. \u201cI need you to tell me what happened. I need to know who the men were, so I can make them pay.\u201d</p><p>Violet closed her eyes, as if in pain. She sat that way a long time, and Emma thought she\u2019d failed. But then Violet spoke in a surprisingly strong voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want my family to know. They\u2019ve suffered enough with this.\u201d</p><p>Emma thought quickly. She needed someplace to meet with Violet, someplace where she\u2019d feel safe. Duncan\u2019s estate was probably the most secure, but it was clearly out of the question. Even if Violet had never been to the house, there were too many vampires. And Duncan would never agree to do it at Emma\u2019s house, not after the other night. Damn. Well, they\u2019d work something out. Duncan and his vampires probably had houses all over the place. They\u2019d simply have to be sure the one they chose wasn\u2019t someplace Victor had used for his perverted games.</p> <p>\u201cIf you agree to help me, I\u2019ll pick you up myself,\u201d Emma assured Violet. \u201cYou can tell your parents I\u2019m a friend. They\u2019ll be glad you\u2019re getting out,\u201d she said, knowing it was true.</p><p>Violet nodded tiredly. \u201cFine. I just want this over with. I want my life back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Emma said and meant it. She\u2019d started this to find justice for Lacey, but they couldn\u2019t hurt Lacey anymore. They were still hurting Violet Slayton, though, and Emma was going to make them stop.</p><p>She traded phone numbers with Violet, promising to get back in touch with her first thing in the morning to set up something. She was nervous about leaving Violet alone, afraid something would happen. Afraid, frankly, that she\u2019d change her mind and run. But Violet flatly refused to go with her, so there was nothing Emma could do. She\u2019d just have to trust.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she was in her car and heading back to the District that she realized how late it had gotten. In retrospect, she was kind of surprised that Duncan or one of his guys hadn\u2019t called to find out where she was. It actually concerned her a little. Had something else happened? Something that had them all so busy, they didn\u2019t have time to worry about her whereabouts?</p><p>At the next red light, she picked up her cell phone and scrolled through to Duncan\u2019s number. It was the first time she\u2019d called him since he\u2019d given her his business card a little over a week ago. She was startled to realize it hadn\u2019t been any longer than that. So much had happened, it didn\u2019t seem possible so little time had passed.</p><p>The light turned green and she tucked the phone between her ear and shoulder as Duncan\u2019s number went straight to voice mail. Maybe it was too early to call. After all, the sun was barely down, the sky still light on the horizon. Maybe vampires weren\u2019t early risers or whatever you called someone who woke with the sunset.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s voice mail beeped, inviting her to leave a message. She dropped the phone into her hand and held it to her face.</p><p>\u201cHi, Duncan, Emma here, calling to let you know I\u2019m on my way, and I\u2019ve got news. I\u2019ll tell you when I get there.\u201d</p><p>She paused, suddenly unsure how to sign off. The usual okay, bye didn\u2019t really cut it, and the mwaah of a phone kiss seemed trite, given the heat between them. She took the coward\u2019s way out and simply disconnected, tossing the phone onto the passenger seat.</p><p>She and the too sexy Duncan were going to have a heart-to-heart very soon. Maybe tonight after he heard about how she\u2019d found Violet Slayton. This was good news for their investigation, really good news. A little celebration wouldn\u2019t be out of order. And what better way to celebrate than finally getting naked together?</p><p>Her stomach tightened as the image of a half-naked Duncan flashed in her mind. She zipped up the ramp onto 95 and hit the gas. It was going to be a very good night.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Duncan stared at his prisoner, the unfortunate who\u2019d attacked Emma and nearly killed Baldwin, as difficult as it was to kill a vampire. It was just good fortune that Duncan and Miguel had been so close, and that Baldwin had been alert enough to get Emma to call them. A few more minutes and he\u2019d have bled out, despite their best efforts. And apart from the threat to Emma\u2014which Duncan wasn\u2019t likely to forget\u2014the attack on one of his own was something he couldn\u2019t forgive.</p><p>Except that this man truly was an unfortunate who, if he could be believed, had chosen the wrong house to burgle. And Duncan had no reason not to believe him. As far as he could determine, the man was telling the truth. And there were damn few vampires more skilled at detecting lies among humans than Duncan was, especially once he\u2019d slipped into the human\u2019s mind and made him all comfy and relaxed. At that point, there was no deception left in the man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth, man,\u201d the prisoner whined for the umpteenth time. \u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say,\u201d Miguel snarled.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cuz it\u2019s the truth, man. I saw the funeral notice and checked out the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you steal from the dead, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t ashamed of it. A body\u2019s dead, what does it matter who gets their stuff? Might as well be me. Nice place like that, I figured there\u2019d be something worthwhile, so I kept an eye on it, and when nobody comes home, I made my play. Two minutes later, this bitch shows up and all hell breaks loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you shot my man,\u201d Duncan said tightly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, shit happens. He startled me is all. Shouldn\u2019t startle a man like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. So it\u2019s his fault he got shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, sort of.\u201d</p><p>Duncan studied the man, wondering if he shouldn\u2019t return a good dose of fear to the human, if for no other reason than to punish him for being such a worm.</p><p>\u201cIs it possible someone got to him, Sire?\u201d Miguel asked softly.</p><p>Duncan had already considered, and rejected, the possibility that another vampire had manipulated this pitiful excuse for a man and sent him to kill Emma.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of tampering. The problem is,\u201d he admitted, \u201cthat this creature really does prey on the dead. If someone knew that, it would be simplicity itself to direct him to Emma\u2019s and let him do what he does best. The necessary suggestion would be so mild that unless the vampire was a total idiot, the result would be all but undetectable, even to me. Especially since the human honestly believes what he\u2019s telling us.\u201d</p><p>Miguel frowned. \u201cSo what do we do with him? He nearly killed Baldwin.\u201d</p><p>Duncan agreed. He couldn\u2019t simply let the man go. He hadn\u2019t killed anyone last night, not that Duncan knew of anyway, but it was probably only a matter of time before he did. On the other hand, it wasn\u2019t Duncan\u2019s responsibility to protect the human race from itself, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe our friend here fully appreciates the dangers of his chosen profession. I think a small lesson is in order, after which you can send him back into the wild and let nature take its course.\u201d</p><p>Duncan released the human from the hold he had on his brain, and watched fear reassert itself as all the appropriate chemicals filtered back into the man\u2019s bloodstream.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d the human said, staring around with wide, terrified eyes as he took in his predicament. \u201cWho are you people?\u201d</p> <p>Miguel bared his fangs and grinned at the struggling human. The man was still screaming when Duncan left the basement and headed for his office, wondering idly where Emma was. It was well past the one hour after sunset time they\u2019d agreed upon. He could always call the guard he\u2019d assigned to her and find out what she was doing. But if anything significant had happened the guard would have called him by now. Perhaps she\u2019d had to work late or perhaps . . . His phone rang as he sat behind his desk. Glancing at the caller ID, he saw that it was Jackson Hissong, the human in charge of his daytime guards. Duncan frowned. It wasn\u2019t usual for Jackson to be around this late.</p><p>\u201cJackson,\u201d he said, answering. \u201cYou\u2019re here late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. I\u2019m about to head out, but the guard assigned to follow Emma Duquet today just reported in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Duncan said, alert but not yet alarmed, since there was no tension in Jackson\u2019s voice. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was never in danger, my lord, but she didn\u2019t exactly sit in her office all day, so I thought you\u2019d want to know where she went.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d Duncan agreed. \u201cI\u2019d be very interested in knowing that, Jackson.\u201d</p><p>Emma waved at the guard as the gate opened and she drove onto the estate. She parked in her usual spot to the right side of the front door and got out of the car, slinging her purse and laptop over her shoulder. Still riding the high of having found Violet, she practically skipped up the stairs.</p><p>She opened the front door and stepped inside, blinking in surprise. The big house was even noisier tonight. It sounded as if they were tearing the place down from the inside out, and not trying to be neat about it, either. Ducking her head against the possibility of flying debris, she skirted a pile of . . . what was that anyway? Walls, maybe. Walls that had been torn apart and\u2014</p><p>\u201cLook out below!\u201d the warning shout sounded from above, and Emma quick-stepped into the former library barely evading the new layer of debris which plummeted down the open stairwell and landed on the growing pile.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d she muttered, and peered back into the entryway.</p><p>\u201cEmma! There you are.\u201d</p> <p>Emma did a double take as Baldwin joined her in the small room. \u201cBaldwin,\u201d she said, examining him up and down. \u201cYou look . . . healthy.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her surprise. \u201cVampire, sweet thing. We heal like crazy, especially when someone like Duncan does the honors.\u201d</p><p>Emma remembered Duncan opening his wrist for Baldwin to drink. \u201cDuncan\u2019s blood did that?\u201d</p><p>Baldwin nodded, suddenly serious. \u201cDuncan\u2019s \u00fcber powerful, you know.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. Baldwin had been dying on her floor last night. This was beyond powerful. This was fucking incredible. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay,\u201d she managed.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um . . .\u201d Emma searched for something to say. \u201cI parked out front. Should I move around back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Give me your keys. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. You\u2019re working with Louis, right? I\u2019ll bring the keys up, but the big man wants to see you first. He put out the word and didn\u2019t seem too happy about it either\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t?\u201d Emma asked, more curious than worried.</p><p>Baldwin gave her a sympathetic look. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart. He likes you, so it won\u2019t be too bad. You got those keys?\u201d</p><p>She dug out her keys and handed them over. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>He took the keys, giving her a wink before disappearing outside. Emma stood in the relative safety of the former library for a moment, mulling over Baldwin\u2019s warning. So, Duncan was unhappy with her? Okay, so she hadn\u2019t gone to work and rushed right back here, like a good little worker bee. And maybe she was a little late, and maybe he\u2019d been worried, but she had called. And she\u2019d found Violet Slayton, which was huge, if only anyone would listen. Wasn\u2019t this what she was supposed to be doing? Wasn\u2019t that what this was all about?</p><p>Mentally squaring her shoulders, and kind of pissed that her good news was being trampled on by Duncan\u2019s ego, she took a single step out of the former library, looked up carefully, then dashed up the stairs.</p><p>Duncan was on the phone when she stuck her head around the half-open door of his office. She had already started to step back into the hallway, when he caught her eye and pointed at the chair in front of his desk. Not that she had to obey him, but it would have been too cowardly to pretend that she hadn\u2019t seen nor understood his gesture. And what was she worried about anyway? She sat on the designated chair and wished she\u2019d changed clothes before coming here. At least then she could have slumped casually instead of sitting up straight in her pencil skirt and heels like little Miss Priss.</p><p>Duncan ignored her once she was in the chair. He was sitting sideways to the desk and speaking to someone about what sounded like the house renovations. Something about the basement and a vault and the water table. She yawned pointedly. A point which Duncan obviously got and didn\u2019t appreciate, if the look he gave her was any indication. Gee. Too bad.</p><p>Emma was feeling more belligerent with every moment she waited for Duncan to get off the phone. Who did he think he was anyway? She didn\u2019t work for him. Here she\u2019d managed to find their biggest break yet, and she was being made to feel like a misbehaving school girl. And all because she\u2019d taken the initiative instead of waiting hours for Duncan\u2019s permission. Like she needed that? She\u2019d built up a fine, righteous anger by the time Duncan disconnected and tossed the phone to his desk. He stood and strolled over to the door, closing it quietly.</p><p>Emma followed him with her eyes as far as she could, but refused to feed his ego by twisting around in the chair to watch him close the door at her back. She was exquisitely aware of him, though, especially when he came up right behind her and said, \u201cHow was your day, Emma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cHow was\u2014\u201d She jumped as he placed his hands on her shoulders, slid them down her arms and covered her hands, trapping her in the chair.</p><p>Duncan leaned in close, his lips nibbling at her ear before he said softly, \u201cBusy doing what?\u201d</p><p>Emma sat perfectly still. She could feel the strength of his hands over hers, the muscles in his arms and chest as he surrounded her. His hair was loose, and it brushed against her cheek like strands of warm silk. He was the sexiest, most gorgeous man she had ever met, and if they\u2019d had an extra hour late last night, they\u2019d have been fucking like bunnies. But there was something about him tonight that made her primitive, animal brain sit up and scream danger!</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, Emma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you upset with me?\u201d</p><p>His lips touched her temple in a soft kiss. \u201cWhy would I be upset?\u201d he murmured. His lips roamed down along her jaw, skimming the edge of her mouth before moving back up to the soft skin beneath her ear.</p><p>Emma was having trouble breathing, and her heart was pounding so hard she was pretty sure he could see it thumping up and down beneath her clothes. As if he\u2019d heard her thought, Duncan lifted one of his hands from hers and slid his fingers beneath the collar of her shirt and along her clavicle, teasing downward until his touch grazed the top of her breasts. Emma closed her eyes and let her head fall back against his chest.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Emma,\u201d Duncan said, his voice a midnight whisper against her ear, promising all sorts of sinful delights. \u201cDid you enjoy your visit to Alexandria?\u201d</p><p>Emma froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Violet Slayton, that was very clever of you, except\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept what?\u201d She snapped upright, her body abruptly torn between the desire still thrumming along her nerves and anger that he somehow knew every step she\u2019d taken today. She tried to pull away from him and found herself lifted out of the chair, the hold on her arms careful but unbreakable as he spun her around and glared at her. His brown eyes were no longer just warm; they were burning hot, with that bronze glow lighting them from within.</p><p>\u201cExcept that Tammy Dietrich works for Max Grafton,\u201d he growled. \u201cThe same Max Grafton who we know was connected to Victor and his filthy parties.\u201d</p><p>Emma hadn\u2019t known about Dietrich\u2019s connection to Grafton. Her own checking hadn\u2019t turned up any obvious link between them, but if there was one, it was significant. He was right about that much. Not that she was going to admit it. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she argued defiantly. \u201cA guy like Grafton has tons of lawyers doing work for him. She could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s his fucking sister, Emma. And he\u2019s her only client. What does that tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Emma said, trying to focus when Duncan was still holding her as close as a lover, even though he was well beyond upset with her. Something didn\u2019t add up about all of this. If she could only\u2014</p><p>It suddenly clicked. \u201cHow did you know about Dietrich? I didn\u2019t even know about her until earlier today when I went through the mourner\u2019s book and called . . . Are you tapping my phone? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need to tap your damn phone. I had a guard on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had me followed?\u201d She pushed against his chest, but he still wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I did. Someone nearly killed you last night,\u201d he growled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d she insisted. \u201cHe didn\u2019t pull the gun until I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Emma,\u201d he exploded. \u201cDo you have to be dead and bleeding before you\u2019ll let me help you?\u201d</p><p>Emma stared at him in shock. She\u2019d never seen Duncan lose his cool like this. Not when they\u2019d found Lacey\u2019s body, not even when his own man was bleeding out on the floor of her house. \u201cYou have helped me,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have survived any of this without you.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan sighed and loosened his grip at last, rubbing the knuckles of one hand over her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you, Emmaline. Not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to lose me.\u201d She rested her forehead against his cheek, breathing in the scent of him. \u201cBesides,\u201d she added softly, and looked up to meet his eyes. \u201cYou owe me hours of incredibly hot sex.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grew still, his gaze hot and intent, but not with anger this time. \u201cWhat I promised was hours of making love, not simply sex,\u201d he murmured, brushing his lips over hers, before his teeth closed gently on her lower lip. \u201cThere is a difference, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed her, and Emma discovered there was indeed a difference. His mouth was soft at first, his lips barely brushing hers, as if seeking entry. Her lips parted on a sigh, and he moved in for the kill, his mouth coming down hard and demanding as his arms tightened around her.</p><p>Emma met his demand with a ferocity all her own, her tongue meeting his in a twisting dance for dominance as she raised her arms around his neck and raked her fingers beneath his long hair and up against his scalp. He bit her lip again, harder this time, and laughed against her mouth when she bit him back with a low growl.</p> <p>\u201cVicious woman,\u201d he murmured, pulling her shirt out of her tight skirt and running his hands up her bare back to her bra, which opened to a deft twist of his fingers.</p><p>Emma groaned as her breasts were freed from their confinement, rubbing herself against his chest, relishing the hard planes of muscle against her sensitive nipples. She grabbed the bottom of his sweater and yanked upward, wanting some skin. He swore softly, but let go of her long enough to tug the sweater over his head and toss it aside. Emma shrugged out of her jacket and shirt all at once, letting them fall behind her as her bra slid down her arms.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Duncan whispered, and covered her breasts with his big hands, his thumbs stroking her nipples until they were firm and dark and begging to be suckled.</p><p>But Duncan had other plans. Emma whimpered when he abandoned her breasts, his hands reaching instead for her butt as he pressed her up against his erection, squeezing the globes of her ass as he pumped against her. His mouth was all over her neck, licking and sucking until she thought she\u2019d go mad. What was it she\u2019d thought of calling him the other night? A pussy tease? Clit tease? Whatever it was, he was still doing it\u2014and still trying to drive her crazy.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d she panted.</p><p>His only response was a humming noise as he bent to take a taut nipple into his mouth at last.</p> <p>Emma groaned, fisting her fingers in his hair and holding him against her in case he thought to escape. She struggled to catch her breath, wishing she\u2019d worn a different skirt, or no skirt at all, so she could wrap her legs around his hips and feel that long, hard erection between her thighs. She would climax from just the feel of it against her swollen sex. She knew she would.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d she said again, sucking in a sharp breath as he scraped his teeth over her nipple and she felt the sharp points of his fangs against her tender flesh. She breathed out on a sigh of pleasure. \u201cYou know those hours you talked about?\u201d</p><p>His tongue lapped at her breast, soothing the sting of his fangs. \u201cMmmm,\u201d he said as he moved to her other breast, his fingers continuing to stroke the one he was leaving behind.</p><p>\u201cDo you think . . . Oh my God,\u201d she gasped as his mouth closed over the second swollen nipple and he sucked hard, pulling half of her breast into the warmth of his mouth. She almost orgasmed right then as pleasure shot along her nerve endings like lightning. It arrowed straight to her clit which she swore could feel every ridge and vein of Duncan\u2019s cock despite the two layers of clothing between them. Emma moaned in frustration and gave his hair a firm tug.</p><p>He looked up at her, his eyes so hot with color she was amazed he could see anything at all.</p><p>\u201cCan we fuck first?\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cAnd make love later? Please?\u201d</p><p>Duncan stared at her for all of ten seconds, and then bared his teeth in a slow, wicked smile. Faster than Emma would have thought possible, he grabbed her skirt and shoved it up to her waist, his fingers gliding along her bare thighs before shifting to rip away her panties. Just as quickly, he lifted her to his waist, wrapping her legs around his hips as he pushed her against the wall. She felt the brief touch of his hand between them, and then his cock was free, sliding along the soaking wet folds between her thighs, tormenting her already begging clit. Another touch of his hand as he positioned himself, and then one long, steady thrust, and he was balls deep inside her. Emma\u2019s entire body shuddered with such intense desire that she bit into his shoulder to swallow her screams. Duncan pumped once, twice, and then Emma was coming harder than she ever had before, her head thrown back, teeth buried in her lip to keep from letting the entire household know she was being fucked against the wall and loving every minute of it.</p><p>Duncan held onto her as she trembled in the aftermath, jolts of sensation continuing to shoot along every nerve. His hands were cupping her bare ass, his chest crushing her breasts as he held her against the wall. And then he started moving again\u2014long, slow thrusts of his thick shaft that left the walls of her vagina shivering with delight, rippling along his cock as he lifted her higher and drove even deeper inside her. Emma tightened her inner muscles, squeezing and caressing him, welcoming his delicious penetration.</p> <p>Duncan hissed as her sex clenched around his erection, and then groaned as he began to pump faster, his hips slamming into hers with the slap of bare skin, his mouth moving over her neck until she felt the nip of his teeth over her jugular. Emma\u2019s heartbeat soared with equal parts fear and excitement as she felt the dull scrape of his fangs, and then fear and every other emotion fled as a sudden heat seared the blood in her veins, as raw ecstasy shot along every nerve in her body, all of it coming together in the tiny nub of her clit. Her vaginal walls convulsed around the thickness of Duncan\u2019s cock, and she heard a high keening noise coming from her own throat as she struggled not to scream, trapping the sound in her chest where it took on a life of its own fighting to get out. She gasped for air as Duncan continued to pound into her, until finally she felt a rush of wet heat and he roared his completion.</p><p>They hung on to each other, panting for breath, hearts pumping in a single beat. Emma\u2019s legs were still locked around his waist, her arms cradling his head as he nuzzled her neck where Emma was pretty sure he hadn\u2019t bitten her yet. He\u2019d nipped at her skin, but she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually drawn blood. He\u2019d told her that vampire sex was addictive because their bite felt so good, but she couldn\u2019t imagine sex with Duncan being anymore intoxicating than what she\u2019d just experienced. She\u2019d never want to let him out of bed. Come to think of it, she thought with a smile, she already didn\u2019t.</p><p>The rush of blood faded enough that Emma could hear again, and she became aware of the construction noise outside Duncan\u2019s office\u2014the shouts of his men, the crash of materials as they tore the house apart. She groaned, realizing they\u2019d probably heard everything.</p><p>Duncan chuckled, his mouth nibbling her neck one last time before he lifted his head and met her gaze. Blond hair hung over his forehead and his eyes gleamed with smug good humor. \u201cThey didn\u2019t hear us, Emma. This room is insulated for privacy, and besides, you were too busy biting me to scream.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s face heated with embarrassment, but then she said, \u201cBut . . . you didn\u2019t bite me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, confirming her suspicions.</p><p>Emma frowned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>When Duncan gave her a puzzled look, she said, \u201cI mean, you said sex and blood were connected for you all, and that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never take blood from you without asking first, Emma. And since you demanded that we fuck immediately,\u201d he added, with a grin, \u201cI had no time to ask.\u201d</p><p>Emma blushed at the reminder, and was suddenly aware that he was still holding her against the wall and that she was more than half naked. Her blush deepened. \u201cUm, you can probably put me down now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Duncan said. Instead of releasing her, he tightened his hold and, without warning, turned away from the wall and started across the room.</p><p>Emma shrieked in surprise, her arms clutching his neck. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping my promise,\u201d he said carrying her around his desk and over to another door, which she assumed was a closet until he bent his knees slightly and opened it with one hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>Duncan stepped into the adjoining room and kicked the door shut behind them. Emma looked around as soft lights came up. They were in a bedroom. A huge bedroom, with heavy drapes covering the windows and an enormous bed. Oh my.</p><p>Duncan set her in the middle of the big bed and immediately began stripping away what was left of her clothes. Her jacket and shirt were gone, as were her shoes, and her panties were nothing but shredded lace on the floor in his office somewhere. He unzipped her skirt, which was bunched around her waist, then tugged it off and eyed her thigh-high stockings thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI like those,\u201d he said, then kicked off his shoes and shoved his faded denims down, stepping out of them to reveal two things . . . one, he wasn\u2019t wearing underwear\u2014and wasn\u2019t that just the sexiest thing. And two, vampires didn\u2019t need recovery time between erections. His cock was long and thick and beautifully aroused, stiffening even further when she stared at it, as if it enjoyed the attention. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Duncan knelt on the bed and ran his hands up her legs, caressing her calves beneath the silk of her stockings, pressing her thighs open as his touch moved to the delicate skin between her legs. Emma felt her face heat as he spread her thighs even wider, as his hot gaze settled on the swollen folds of her sex. He raised his head to meet her eyes, then licked his lips slowly, deliberately.</p><p>Emma gasped, feeling her face get even hotter when he stretched out between her legs and palmed her butt, his thumbs coming up to open her wide. Her breath caught as he ran his tongue through the folds of her slit. She was already wet and slick from the thundering orgasms Duncan had given her, and he lapped it up like cream, his tongue dipping into her shivering core, gliding along every crease and fold until he finally licked her so sensitive clit. Her muscles jerked in reaction and he did it again, circling around and over that tight bundle of nerves in an unpredictable pattern, tormenting her.</p><p>Emma fisted her hands in his hair, her need so overpowering, she forgot to be embarrassed, too focused on deciding whether she wanted to hold him in place or pull him away. Her head was thrown back, her eyes closed, as she struggled to process the overload of feelings. Not only his mouth on her pussy, or his wicked tongue teasing her clit, but the press of his big shoulders against her thighs, the silken slide of his hair against her belly. But even more was the simple fact that it was Duncan doing these things.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d she whispered, wanting to tell him it was too much, that she couldn\u2019t handle so many different sensations all at once. But as if anticipating her protest, he suddenly sucked hard on her clit, taking it into his mouth like a juicy morsel of fruit.</p><p>The orgasm rocketed through her without warning, her abdomen clenching tightly as her inner muscles rippled, trying to hold onto a cock that wasn\u2019t even there. He\u2019d brought her to a climax with just his mouth, and unbelievable ecstasy speared her through and through. Emma screamed, unable to hold it back, no longer caring if anyone heard.</p><p>Duncan gripped the firm globes of Emma\u2019s ass, drinking in the sweet nectar of her orgasm as she convulsed beneath him. God, she was wet. And she tasted so good. Her cream was almost as good as the tiny taste of blood he\u2019d had from her breasts earlier. It had taken supreme self control to satisfy himself with only the scent of her blood, with nipping at the skin above her vein and knowing that soon he would have Emma\u2019s blood rolling like liquid velvet down his throat.</p><p>And she\u2019d been so ready for him. When he\u2019d brushed the dull edge of his fangs against her skin, she hadn\u2019t pulled away, hadn\u2019t shrieked in fear. He\u2019d sensed the rush of excitement as her heart sped up, as her blood pumped harder, plumping her vein in anticipation of his bite.</p><p>She would come so beautifully when he finally bit her. Just as she was coming for him now.</p><p>He stroked his tongue over her clit a final time, then came up on all fours, prowling up over her body until his shaft was nestled between her legs. He bent over and sucked the tip of one full, tender breast into his mouth, and Emma\u2019s violet eyes flashed open. They were glazed nearly lavender with lust as she smiled up at him. And he was gone.</p><p>He reached down and positioned his cock against her opening, then thrust once hard with his hips, burying himself deep inside her. Her inner walls, still throbbing with her climax, pulsed along his length, surrounding him in liquid heat. He lowered himself over her, taking her mouth as he began flexing his hips, reveling in the friction of her satiny channel against his cock as he moved in and out of her, the feel of her full breasts, her nipples big and swollen\u2014hard like velvet-covered pebbles against his chest.</p><p>Emma wrapped her arms around his shoulders as he kissed her, her legs crossing behind his back as she began to lift her hips up to meet him. He growled and began to thrust harder, wanting to make her climax again, wanting to feel her body clench around his shaft as her juices flowed hot and wet.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he whispered against her neck, breathing in the tantalizing scent of her blood so very close. He stroked his tongue over her vein, feeling the blood straining against its confinement, begging for his fangs.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he repeated intently.</p><p>Emma moaned, then licked her lips slowly. Her eyes opened and met his directly. \u201cDo it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Duncan gave a hard thrust of his cock. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please, Duncan.\u201d She turned her head to one side, baring her neck, stretching it taut in invitation.</p><p>Duncan hissed, his eyelids drooping heavily as lust-fueled hunger roared along every nerve and into every muscle. He bent his head to her neck, his mouth going unerringly to the thick swell of her jugular. Using only his lips, he sucked hard on the vein, plumping it further, drawing it into his mouth without breaking the skin. Emma gasped, and he smiled. He rubbed the blunt surface of his fangs along her neck, gliding them back and forth, teasing her. Emma\u2019s fingers dug into his biceps and her already pounding heart began to race. A sudden tremor of excitement tightened her inner muscles, rippling along his cock, still sheathed deep inside her.</p><p>He lifted his head and sank his fangs into her vein, groaning at the rush of thick, sweet blood, fragrant with arousal, as rich as honey. Emma\u2019s hands moved from his shoulders to grip his nape, holding his mouth against her. She cried out in surprise as the euphoric in his bite hit her bloodstream, as if she was stunned by her own body\u2019s response. The ripple of muscle along his shaft quickened, and Duncan began thrusting harder, faster, driven as much by Emma\u2019s need as by his own. Her beautiful violet eyes opened and she stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she whispered, and then she was pushed over the edge as her hot, little body clenched, grabbing his cock so tightly he could barely move. Emma screamed as the orgasm rolled over them both, as his own groans mixed with her cries of pleasure, and he shot his release deep inside her womb.</p><p>Duncan lay on top of her, breathing hard, knowing he should move. He was heavy, and for all her height, Emma was delicate. But he couldn\u2019t find the strength to lift himself. He lay there a few moments longer, Emma\u2019s arms still holding him, her ankles still locked over his ass. Finally, he reached back and lifted one of her legs. Her thighs fell open as if there was no strength left in her muscles. Duncan smiled and shifted to one side, taking her with him so she lay against his chest, in the curve of his arm.</p><p>They stayed that way for a long time, silent, breathing, their hearts slowly returning to normal.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Emmaline?\u201d he asked, rubbing his chin over her fragrant hair.</p> <p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Emma murmured lazily. \u201cOkay doesn\u2019t even come close. Blissed out, maybe.\u201d She lifted her head enough to lick his nipple. \u201cTell me something,\u201d she said. \u201cAm I allowed to bite you, too?\u201d Her teeth closed over his nipple, emphasizing her words.</p><p>Duncan growled, reaching down to squeeze her ass in warning. \u201cJust remember, my fangs are sharper, and you\u2019re very tasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well, I\u2019m not complaining. As long as I get to bite back.\u201d</p><p>Duncan shuddered with pleasure. \u201cFeel free, darlin\u2019. I\u2019m all yours.\u201d He realized as he said the words that it was true. Emma Duquet had somehow managed to do what no woman had since his wife had died nearly two hundred years ago. She\u2019d gotten inside his heart.</p><p>Emma gave his nipple another playful lick, then sat up and, humming softly, straddled his hips. The wet heat of her sex teased the base of his cock as she rocked back and forth above him, her hands braced on his chest, her breasts swaying tantalizingly out of reach. He leaned up and caught one in his mouth, sucking hard before she swayed away from him again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushing your luck,\u201d he warned, his gaze heavy as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cSauce for the goose,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Duncan frowned briefly, but decided he didn\u2019t care what she meant. All he cared about was getting his mouth on those beautiful breasts and his dick inside her one more time.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, gripping her hips.</p><p>\u201cNuh uh,\u201d Emma replied, continuing to rock, but leaning back so he couldn\u2019t reach her breasts.</p><p>\u201cEmma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>In a single move, he flipped her over and under him, driving himself deep inside her, exactly where he wanted to be. Emma gasped in surprise and then groaned as he began to move, grinding against her clit every time he plunged into her tight pussy.</p><p>\u201cI did warn you,\u201d he murmured, then lowered his head and bit the tip of one swollen nipple, letting his fangs scrape against the soft skin of her breast until blood welled. He licked the blood away, and Emma shivered with a pleasure that matched his own as he tasted her sweet blood on his tongue. He began to thrust harder, wanting to feel her hot and tight as she came around his cock one more time, to establish once and for all that she was his and no other\u2019s. Her stomach muscles trembled as the orgasm began to rip through her, the convulsions shivering down through her womb to race along the slick walls surrounding his shaft. Her sex tightened around him, alternately squeezing and releasing his cock as he continued to slide in and out of her, grinding against her swollen clit.</p><p>Emma cried his name when she came this time, her nails drawing blood along his back, her legs crushing the breath from his body. Duncan felt his own release building as his sac tightened and his balls grew heavy. Suddenly, Emma bit his shoulder hard enough to draw blood, and with a shout he crashed over the edge as the orgasm took him.</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t think he could move. A hundred and fifty years of making love to some of the most beautiful women in the world, and for the first time he actually felt drained. Not that he\u2019d have any trouble getting it up again if Emma was so inclined. He lifted his head and gazed down at her, brushing a lock of hair away from her sweaty cheek. He smiled and figured she wouldn\u2019t be demanding a repeat performance for a while at least. Moving carefully, he slid to one side, pulling her with him. She sighed and nestled against his body, her head on his shoulder.</p><p>A powerful surge of protectiveness flooded his senses and he had to fight to keep his muscles loose and relaxed so she wouldn\u2019t notice. The urgency to mate, to make her his, had eased now that he\u2019d taken her body and blood. She might not know it yet, but Emma Duquet belonged to him. No other vampire would dare touch her, or they would face his wrath. And his wrath would be a terrible thing when it came to Emma. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The ringing of his cell phone stirred Duncan to alertness sometime later. Emma had fallen asleep and he hadn\u2019t wanted to disturb her, so he\u2019d held her while she slept and let his mind continue working over the many details demanding his attention these days. Everything from the continuing construction, to the question of Lacey\u2019s killers, to the all important issue of Emma\u2019s safety. If it was up to him, she wouldn\u2019t leave the residence until he knew that all of those responsible for Lacey\u2019s death had been dealt with and were no longer a threat. His preferred mode of ensuring her safety was the most permanent one, although rationally he understood it would raise a few flags if several elected officials died all at once. So he\u2019d kill the worst of them and ensure the others left town. For now.</p><p>Emma stirred at the sound of the phone, her eyes fluttering open slowly. She stiffened, probably realizing she wasn\u2019t in her own bed. And then, to his great pleasure, she relaxed against him. It did something to his heart to know that waking next to him made her feel secure enough to relax.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably Miguel,\u201d he said, kissing the top of her head. \u201cI should talk to him.\u201d</p> <p>Emma sat up, then leaned over to give him a thorough kiss, her naked breasts swaying close enough that he cupped one in his hand, smiling when her nipple immediately hardened in response. She hummed with pleasure and pushed against his hand before pulling away. \u201cTell Miguel he has lousy timing,\u201d she said, then slipped out of bed and headed for the bathroom.</p><p>Duncan watched her shapely ass until she closed the door, then padded out to the other room to retrieve his phone from the desk. He didn\u2019t actually have to answer to know it was Miguel calling him. The connection between a Sire and his vampire child was very strong, especially when the Sire was as powerful as Duncan.</p><p>\u201cMiguel,\u201d he said, answering the phone.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Miguel said cautiously. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to interrupt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d he assured his lieutenant. If it had truly been an interruption, Duncan wouldn\u2019t have answered at all.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord, the guard we had on Ms. Duquet today tells me she spent a great deal of time with Violet Slayton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cEmma and I will join you in the computer room shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sire.\u201d</p><p>Duncan disconnected, smiling at Miguel\u2019s discretion. What he\u2019d told Emma about the room being soundproofed was true. None of his vampires would have heard what was going on. But that didn\u2019t mean their brains stopped working. Even without their blood link to him, they would have detected the strong emotions being generated. When one added that link into the mix, they knew very well what Duncan had been up to this evening.</p><p>Emma emerged from the bathroom, her beautiful breasts and everything else on full display. She glanced up to see Duncan watching her hungrily.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d she chided him. \u201cOr we\u2019ll never get out of this room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould that be a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>Emma laughed. \u201cEventually you\u2019d get tired of me.\u201d</p><p>Duncan crossed to her in two long strides, sliding his arm around her waist and pulling her firmly against his body. \u201cNever,\u201d he whispered in between nibbling kisses to her ear and throat. Emma wrapped her arms around him with a hungry little cry of her own, and tilted her head against his shoulder, giving him full access to her neck. She shivered when he bit the lobe of her ear, and her nipples poked his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very bad man, Duncan,\u201d she whispered, her breath hot against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a man at all, Emma. And while some may consider me bad, I\u2019m very good at what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, kissing his shoulder before pulling away to give him a curious look.</p><p>\u201cI take care of the people who matter to me, and especially those I consider mine.\u201d He kissed her soft mouth. \u201cAnd you, Emmaline, are most definitely mine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her badgered,\u201d Emma said for what felt like the hundredth time. She was sitting in the makeshift computer room along with Duncan and several of his vampires, including Phoebe. The chair was hard and uncomfortable, the room was cold, and she was bone tired. She\u2019d been up most of the previous night, had worked a full day today, driven out to Violet Slayton\u2019s home and back again, and then spent a vigorous couple of hours with Duncan\u2014not that she\u2019d give back one minute of her time with Duncan no matter how little sleep she had. But it was beginning to look as though she wouldn\u2019t get much sleep tonight either. That was the problem in working with vampires. They were fresh and raring to go, just getting started on their day, so to speak, while she wanted nothing more than to sleep for about eight hours straight.</p><p>Except that they were discussing their approach to Violet Slayton, which was something Emma cared a great deal about. She was not going to let them badger the poor woman into telling them what she knew, no matter the stakes.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Duncan said patiently. \u201cShe\u2019s probably our best source for getting the identity of the men involved in Lacey\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t remember anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she will,\u201d Duncan insisted, also for the hundredth time. \u201cThe very fact that she\u2019s as spooked as you say she is, that she knows something happened and is having nightmares about it, tells me that whoever messed with her head did a piss poor job of it. I can fix that and get what we need at the same time. You say you care about her, then let me repair the damage they\u2019ve done to her mind.\u201d</p><p>Emma regarded Duncan steadily. He was leaning back against the table across from hers, long legs stretched out in front of him and crossed at the ankles. He looked his usual cool and studly self in black jeans and t-shirt, his hair pulled back in a neat tail. And she was pretty sure he could lie his ass off and she\u2019d never know the difference if he didn\u2019t want her to. But she trusted him. God knew he was wicked in bed, but he was also a good man out of it.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut no one else, Duncan. If you all show up en masse, she\u2019ll freak out and we\u2019ll never get a word out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cAnd I go with you.\u201d When Duncan frowned, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll see you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d he said reluctantly. \u201cBut you said she didn\u2019t want to meet at her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So we\u2019ll have figure out someplace neutral. Not here,\u201d she said immediately. \u201cFor all we know, this is one of the places Victor and his buddies assaulted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiguel,\u201d Duncan said, shifting his gaze to his lieutenant. \u201cWe\u2019ll need someplace private, but not so isolated that she feels threatened. And none of Victor\u2019s properties. We can\u2019t know which ones he used.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it at our house,\u201d Phoebe offered from her seat next to Emma. \u201cIt\u2019s close to where Slayton lives, and we have plenty of privacy. Plus with Ted living there, it has a messy, lived-in feel to it,\u201d she added dryly.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Pheebs?\u201d Duncan asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Our offices are on the same property, so we have people in and out all the time, but I\u2019ll make sure you have the place to yourself for this.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThank you, then. Miguel, we\u2019ll do it tomorrow night. You can check out the property tonight. Do whatever you need to do to feel secure about the setup. Emma and I will pick up Violet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Emma interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ll pick up Violet alone and take her to the house. Once we\u2019re there, you can join us. She won\u2019t want a stranger in her house, Duncan,\u201d she insisted when he looked as if he\u2019d argue. \u201cYou can have someone tail me if that makes you feel better, but I\u2019ll bring her to Phoebe\u2019s house alone. I\u2019ll need the address and everything so I can map it out ahead of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll program the GPS for you,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be driving one of our SUVs. They\u2019re safer.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded, privately hoping she\u2019d get one of the big V8 SUVs, not some smaller, punier version. Maybe if she asked nicely. Behind Duncan, Baldwin was giving her a thumb\u2019s up, and she fought back a grin. Duncan narrowed his eyes at her suspiciously, but she gave him an innocent smile, which she was sure didn\u2019t fool him for one minute.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Duncan said, clearly calling an end to the meeting. \u201cLouis, you and the others keep working. Miguel, you and I need to talk to Alaric. He\u2019s waiting for us in the new wing. Emma, a moment of your time, please.\u201d</p><p>Uh oh, Emma thought. Busted.</p><p>She followed him down the hall, barely making it through the door of his office before he had her up against the wall and was kissing her. She reacted without thinking, going up on her toes and rubbing her breasts against his chest, kissing him back for all she was worth. He growled and crushed her lips beneath his mouth, his fangs fully in evidence as he bit down hard enough to draw a small taste of her blood.</p><p>Emma gasped and bit him back, tasting the thick honey that was his vampire blood a moment before it hit her bloodstream and sent a jolt of lust spearing right between her legs. She moaned into his mouth, hooked her leg over his hip and began grinding herself shamelessly against him, needing to release the heat building there like a volcano about to blow.</p><p>Duncan swore softly, ripped her jeans open and shoved his hand down into her panties, hissing when his fingers slid into the already wet folds between her legs. \u201cYou\u2019re so damn hot,\u201d he whispered and plunged two fingers up into her hungry pussy, tipping her over into a searing orgasm that slammed her into the wall and left her shuddering and clinging to his shoulders while small jolts of pleasure fired along her nerves at random.</p><p>Duncan carried her to the bedroom and threw her on the bed, his gaze liquid fire against her skin as he stripped away first her pants and then his, not even bothering with the rest of their clothes before he lifted her legs over his shoulders and plunged deep inside her with a single, strong thrust, his sleekly muscled arms braced to either side of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma wanted to stroke him, to glide her palms over the smooth muscles of those powerful shoulders, that firm chest with its light dusting of golden blond hair. He was so beautiful stretched out above her, his cock filling her so completely as he pumped in and out, her body closing eagerly around him with every thrust. She brushed a hand over her nipple\u2014swollen with desire, aching for attention\u2014and gasped at how very good it felt. Duncan\u2019s gaze riveted immediately on her breasts, and Emma smiled, caressing them, squeezing them together, rolling her nipples between her fingers and pinching them hard enough that they grew flushed with blood.</p><p>He snarled, his gaze flashing up to hers and back to her breasts as he began to pump harder. Emma cried out, feeling the pressure growing between her legs, the first tremors of climax tightening her belly and sending shivers of pleasure coursing along her inner walls with every thrust of Duncan\u2019s cock. She closed her eyes against the overwhelming flood of sensation, rubbing her hand down her abdomen and over her mound to her clit which was begging for release.</p><p>Realizing what she was doing, her eyes flashed open in guilt and she looked up to see Duncan watching her hungrily. \u201cDo it,\u201d he demanded. \u201cCome for me, Emma.\u201d</p> <p>Embarrassment heated her already flushed face, but she began to fondle herself, feeling the weight of his stare with every stroke of her fingers. The lips of her sex were swollen and puffy as she rode the tight nub between them, her vagina stretched tight around the thickness of Duncan\u2019s cock.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Emma.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, and he began to pump even faster, his powerful arms holding her in place as he fucked her, as she began to rub her clit harder, desperate now for release. It hit without warning, going from a thrilling ripple to a full blown tidal wave of incredible sensation that roared through her, jumbling her senses until she could only scream and hope she wouldn\u2019t explode from the raw power of it. Some part of her registered Duncan\u2019s triumphant shout as his release flooded inside her, filling her with heat before he collapsed on top of her and scooped her into his arms.</p><p>Duncan tightened his hold on Emma and smiled against her warm, silky hair. She was curled up against him, her lips nuzzling his neck, one arm draped tightly over his chest. She was still trembling from the force of her climax, and he reached down, tugging the coverlet over her body so she didn\u2019t cool down too quickly. Not that he worried for her health, not with all the biting she was doing. He grinned, thinking of the blood she\u2019d taken from him. He could already sense it inside her and knew it would serve as a beacon between them. No matter where she was he would find her. It was a connection which would only get stronger the longer they were together, the more blood she took from him, and he from her.</p><p>The thought of her blood made his cock twitch, despite the fact that he\u2019d barely recovered his breath. He hadn\u2019t bitten her this time, though he\u2019d wanted to. It had been an effort, but he\u2019d already taken quite a bit from her vein earlier and he didn\u2019t want to weaken her. Not when things were so uncertain, when their enemies could be waiting at every turn to take them down. He made a mental note to be sure there was sufficient regular food in the kitchen for her. Eventually, things would normalize, but for now, it was only him and his vampire staff, and they\u2019d barely begun to stock the kitchen with enough blood for all of them.</p> <p>Emma stirred and yawned delicately.</p><p>\u201cYou should sleep,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI can still work\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point until after we speak with Slayton tomorrow. And you need to sleep. I\u2019ve exhausted you.\u201d He heard the smug flavor of his own words and wasn\u2019t surprised when she slapped his chest lightly.</p><p>\u201cBraggart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bragging if it\u2019s true, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she said in disbelief. She laughed in a way that sounded suspiciously like a giggle before she clapped a hand over her mouth to cover it.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine,\u201d she agreed, as if doing him a favor. \u201cYou were magnificent.\u201d</p><p>He slapped her ass playfully. \u201cRemember that the next time you think about flirting with Baldwin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlirting?\u201d she sputtered. \u201cI was not\u2014 Is that why you went all caveman on me? Because of Baldwin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not go caveman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly did. I expected you to start peeing on me or something, marking me with your scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can still do that, if you\u2019d like,\u201d he growled.</p> <p>\u201cNot if you value your dick,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cRemember who sleeps all day and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do anything to my dick. You like it too much.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a thoughtful moment. \u201cWell, that\u2019s true. But you\u2019re totally off-base about Baldwin. I wanted to drive the SUV the other night and he wouldn\u2019t let me. He said you\u2019d kill him if anything happened to me and his reflexes were faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you want to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like driving fast, and I especially like driving fast in big trucks with muscle engines. So when you said I\u2019d be driving one of the SUVs tomorrow night, Baldwin thought it was funny. So did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Duncan said, realizing he may have overreacted just a tad, not that he was going to tell Emma that. \u201cYou need to realize that vampires are extremely territorial, and none more than a vampire lord, which is what I am. It\u2019s why I rule this residence and this territory. And you belong to me, Emma.\u201d</p><p>Emma pulled back and gave him an appraising look, her violet eyes like gleaming amethysts in the dim light. \u201cIf I belong to you,\u201d she said, watching him closely. \u201cDoes that mean you belong to me, too?\u201d</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cBody and soul,\u201d he said, almost daring her to accept it.</p><p>Emma smiled slowly, beginning with a curve of her lips, then lighting up her entire face. \u201cThen I\u2019m yours, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Duncan pulled the covers over Emma, then leaned down to leave a gentle kiss on her cheek. She was deeply asleep, as he\u2019d known she would be. Earlier he\u2019d seen the circles under her eyes, the lines of weariness in her face. And it really wasn\u2019t necessary for her to remain awake tonight. Louis and his team would continue digging through Victor\u2019s files, but the truth was they weren\u2019t even looking for data on the illicit parties anymore, or the men who\u2019d killed Lacey. Everything there was had already been found. As he\u2019d told Emma, if they were going to make any immediate progress on that front, it would have to come from Violet Slayton.</p><p>Duncan was confident of his skill when it came to manipulating a human mind. He\u2019d learned from Raphael and there was no one alive who was better. But he couldn\u2019t know until he met Slayton how much damage Victor had done. He knew he could at least give the young woman some peace and relieve her of the nightmares and flashes of unknown memories. But whether he could do more than that remained to be seen.</p><p>He closed the bedroom door and let himself out of the second floor office, heading downstairs to the east wing. Alaric was there, and so was Miguel. At Duncan\u2019s request, Alaric had pulled everyone off the other projects to focus on this one. More than anything, Duncan wanted his people safe, and they wouldn\u2019t be until the new vault was completed.</p><p>He strode down the back hallway, following the sound of construction and male laughter. Their enemies were closing in. He could feel it. It wasn\u2019t specific. Not like a scout warning, \u201cThey\u2019re coming over the hill at dawn.\u201d It was more of an amorphous and vague sense of danger that filled his lungs with the first breath he drew every sunset and didn\u2019t stop until it was choking him with its urgency.</p><p>He only hoped he would be ready when it finally broke over them all.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>\u201cWhose house is this again?\u201d</p><p>Emma swallowed her instinctive burst of irritation at Violet\u2019s question, which she\u2019d already asked at least three times since they\u2019d arrived.</p><p>\u201cA friend\u2019s,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cHusband and wife, actually. They\u2019re both FBI, so you know it\u2019s a safe place.\u201d It was pretty much the same answer she\u2019d given every time, too. Fortunately, Phoebe and her husband had enough pictures and memorabilia of his days in the FBI\u2014hanging on the walls and sitting on virtually every flat surface\u2014that it was completely believable. Of course, it was also true that the pictures featured much younger versions of well-known FBI directors and various politicians, including one former president. But that worked for them in this case, because it had led Violet to assume they were a comfortably retired couple instead of an eternally young vampire and her mate.</p><p>\u201cNice house,\u201d Violet commented. \u201cTwo government pensions,\u201d she added, as if that explained the nice house.</p><p>Emma nodded. It was a nice house. Violet was right about that much. Emma had followed the instructions from the pleasant lady on the GPS, and pretended she didn\u2019t see the vampires following to make sure she and Violet got here safely. Phoebe and Ted Micheletti\u2019s place was actually an old Virginia farm, with a broken-down barn still standing in postcard perfect disrepair about a hundred yards from the house. Unfortunately, the only thing Emma could think of when she looked at that rickety old barn was rats. The thing had to be crawling with them. She only hoped it was far enough away that they didn\u2019t travel between there and the house. She hated rats.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t mind you using their house?\u201d Violet asked.</p><p>\u201cThey travel a lot, and they\u2019re gone for a few days. I figured it would be better for you if we met outside the city, and this isn\u2019t that far from your parents\u2019 place.\u201d</p><p>Emma had rationalized the nighttime meeting to Violet by pleading her work schedule. With the funeral and everything, she\u2019d told her, she couldn\u2019t take off any more time from work. And it wasn\u2019t far from the truth, either. Sharon had been downright nasty when Emma showed up at the office this morning. Fortunately, Congressman Coffer had been in committee meetings all day, and of course Sharon, as his Chief of Staff, had been with him. That had pretty much prevented Emma from crossing paths with either one of them for the rest of the day. The explanation had touched the right note for Violet, too. She came from a decidedly working class family and understood the importance of a paycheck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you like a cup of something hot?\u201d Emma asked Violet. \u201cOr maybe a soft drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA diet Coke would be good, or\u2014\u201d Violet stiffened as the sound of an engine announced someone\u2019s arrival out front. She raised wide eyes to Emma and looked as if she were trying to decide whether or not to bolt. A single car door opened and then closed after a brief delay.</p><p>\u201cThat will be Duncan,\u201d Emma said reassuringly. Emma and the others, including Duncan, had agreed it would be best to use his real name. It was unlikely, but if Violet ever happened on his picture somewhere and remembered him, she\u2019d know they\u2019d been honest with her. The most probable outcome of today, however, was that Violet wouldn\u2019t remember ever having met Duncan or any other vampire. Ten days or ten years from now, she could bump into him on the street, and he\u2019d be a complete stranger to her. But just in case something went wrong, they were giving her his real name as a sign of faith.</p> <p>Duncan knocked on the screen door instead of using the doorbell. Emma figured it was intentional, more like a neighbor come calling than a stranger. She strolled over to greet him, moving slowly and casually, trying not to let Violet see any of the stress she was feeling about tonight\u2019s encounter.</p><p>Duncan smiled at her through the screen\u2019s mesh, and Emma nearly staggered as a punch of sheer lust hit her. She\u2019d left the residence only a few hours ago, but it was as if she hadn\u2019t seen him, hadn\u2019t touched him, in ages. He winked at her and she blushed, feeling like a schoolgirl with her first crush.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Emma,\u201d he said, his gaze never leaving hers, his voice stroking her nerves with velvet sheathed fangs. He was looking very handsome this evening, but then when didn\u2019t he? Tonight, however, he\u2019d dressed very intentionally, balancing trusted professional with sympathetic listener. He was wearing dark tan khakis that fit far better than those she\u2019d seen on other men, and hugged his tight rear end wonderfully. A black turtleneck and wool blazer topped off the look, with his neatly tied back hair adding a touch of Bohemian free thinker. No stuffy, unimaginative drone here. You want to talk about vampires? This is a man who will not only listen, he\u2019ll believe you.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d she said, feeling wicked and wanting to be sure he was experiencing the same tug of desire she did. \u201cGood of you to . . . come.\u201d His eyes filled with heat and Emma\u2019s body responded instantly, making her wish they had ten minutes to themselves. That\u2019s all it would take. Up against the wall, just a taste to slake her thirst. But, no. She banked her lust, storing it for later, when they\u2019d be alone again in that big bed.</p><p>In the room behind her, Violet coughed softly, and Emma nearly jumped at the timely reminder of why they were all here. She opened the screen door and said, \u201cCome in,\u201d not knowing whether the invitation was necessary or not. Phoebe was a vampire, after all, so maybe the restriction didn\u2019t apply. But she\u2019d forgotten to ask earlier if a vampire\u2019s residence was sacrosanct like a human\u2019s. Darn. If she was going to hang around with vampires, she\u2019d have to start making a list of things she needed to know.</p> <p>Duncan stared at Emma through the open door. The scent of her arousal filled his senses and he was instantly hard. He forced his body to relax, using every bit of control learned in over a century and a half of living. Still, to make things interesting, he let his arm brush against Emma\u2019s breasts as he went by her. He heard her sharp intake of breath and smiled to himself. She wasn\u2019t the only one who could tease.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d Emma said, somewhat breathlessly, he was pleased to note. \u201cThis is my friend Violet.\u201d She walked over to stand next to the other woman who was seated. \u201cI told you about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Duncan said. He didn\u2019t offer to shake hands immediately, but slipped off his blazer and tossed it onto a nearby chair. He took the chair closest to where Violet sat on the sofa, near enough that he could reach out and touch her, but not so near that she would feel overwhelmed by him.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure to meet you, Violet,\u201d he said, finally offering his hand. \u201cI hope I can help.\u201d</p><p>Violet didn\u2019t move at first. She was a pale little thing. Pretty underneath all that stress, and a complete submissive. He knew what Victor had seen in her, knew why she\u2019d been chosen. He didn\u2019t like it, but he understood. She sat there, frozen, like a soft, gray mouse beneath the eye of a predator, although she couldn\u2019t possibly know how apt that description was. Duncan remained still, not wanting to spook her, letting her do this her way and take her time. She studied him for a few minutes, her gaze going from his offered hand to his face, where it lingered to search his eyes, and then back to his hand. She reached out slowly and let him wrap his much bigger fingers around hers. He didn\u2019t shake her hand, but held it loosely, radiating safety and warmth through that connection, gently persuading her that he meant her no harm.</p><p>Silent tears filled Violet\u2019s eyes as she relaxed for what was probably the first time since Victor had messed with her mind. Even a cursory probe told Duncan that the dead vampire lord had been crude in his effort to wipe the young woman\u2019s thoughts. Maybe he\u2019d been in a hurry. Maybe he\u2019d intended to come back and do a more thorough job of it. Or, more likely, he\u2019d simply been a butcher who hadn\u2019t cared what damage he did to the humans he toyed with.</p> <p>Duncan reached out and brushed away a tear that had escaped to roll down Violet\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt will all be well, Violet. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and bent her head, wiping her eyes quickly before raising her head and firming her chin defiantly. \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d</p><p>Duncan smiled at her courage. When Emma had first told him about Violet, he\u2019d assumed she was a broken woman, someone cast off because Victor had found her wanting. But that wasn\u2019t true. She might be naturally submissive, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean weak. It was far more likely that she\u2019d survived as well as she had because she was stronger than Victor expected. Her mind had refused the old vampire lord\u2019s manipulation and clung to the truth, despite the cost to her sanity.</p><p>Duncan squeezed her fingers slightly. \u201cJust tell me what you remember,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>Violet drew a deep breath through her nose, her mouth tight with determination. \u201cIs this like hypnosis or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d Duncan agreed easily. \u201cBut you won\u2019t lose consciousness and you\u2019ll remember everything.\u201d</p><p>She studied him again for a long moment, then said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember that much about what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me whatever you recall,\u201d Duncan said, and sent her mind a mild suggestion to remember.</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She paused for a moment, as if deciding where to start. \u201cThe first party I ever went to,\u201d she began, \u201cwas with Lacey.\u201d</p><p>With every word she spoke, Duncan wove himself deeper into her memories. He was appalled at the mess Victor had left behind. Knots and tangles of memory and half-truths, all jumbled together with things that had no bearing on what Victor had been trying to hide. Duncan was ashamed on behalf of his kind that a vampire lord as powerful as Victor could have been so incompetent, or so cruel. Slowly, he teased out bits and pieces of truth, each new revelation freeing Violet to remember more. He kept a firm hold on her emotions while working, not wanting to cause her any more psychological distress than she\u2019d already endured.</p><p>Violet smiled when she spoke about Lacey. \u201cShe was so pretty, so full of life. All the men loved her. I used to watch them watching her at the parties. When she crossed a room, heads turned as if she was iron and they were magnets. Or maybe it was the other way around. It never affected her, though. Not like some of the others who got all bitchy and looked down their noses. Lacey thought the whole thing was a game.\u201d She frowned briefly. \u201cBut it was definitely a game she wanted to win. She was looking for something at those parties. A husband maybe, or maybe just a rich lover. I never knew her well enough to ask what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the parties at Victor\u2019s house?\u201d Duncan clarified quietly.</p><p>Violet nodded. \u201cThe one in the embassy district, the big white one. Nice place, but the inside was more like a fraternity house than an embassy. It was odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened at these parties?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNothing at first. They were typical Washington stuff. The men were all grabby, especially the married ones, and most of the women didn\u2019t care. Not the young ones anyway. It wasn\u2019t until Victor invited us to the other house, the one in Leesburg that I felt . . . uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Violet tensed up, and Duncan reached out, soothing her with both his hand and his mind. \u201cNo one can hurt you here, Violet. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded quickly. \u201cYes. I believe you.\u201d</p><p>Her words of trust added a fresh burden of responsibility to Duncan\u2019s soul. It was minuscule compared to that which he already bore, but he felt it nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Violet.\u201d He waited a moment, then said, \u201cWhy did you feel uncomfortable at the Leesburg party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my first time at one of the weekends. Lacey had told me about some other house, in Annapolis, I think, but that had been only one night and everyone left before dawn. The party at Leesburg was supposed to be for a whole weekend. I didn\u2019t want to go, but I remember feeling like I had to, like I\u2019d be disappointing someone if I didn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t make sense, but the closer I got to the date of the party, the more I felt like I had to go.\u201d She shrugged, as if even now she couldn\u2019t understand it. But Duncan did. Victor had clearly planted the suggestion in her mind and let it run.</p><p>\u201cI drove down with Lacey, and when we got there,\u201d Violet continued, \u201cthere were only a few men\u2014two or three that I ever saw, plus Victor and his guards. I assumed more people would be coming, but except for three other women who arrived right after me and Lacey, no one else came. And when I realized it was just us and those men, I knew what they wanted us for.\u201d Tears began rolling down her cheeks again, but that was the only sign of her distress as she kept talking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVictor did something to me, to all of us. I did . . . awful things for those men. Disgusting things. Even when I was doing them, I knew something was wrong. It was like my mind was screaming at me from somewhere, but I couldn\u2019t make my body listen. And it went on forever, not just with one man, but with all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Victor participate in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with me,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the others. His guards did, though. When the clients\u2014that\u2019s what Victor called them, like we were whores.\u201d She swallowed hard, revulsion for the men and maybe for herself, too, written on her face. \u201cWhen the clients were finished with us, Victor\u2019s guards took over. And they wanted more than sex, or more than just sex, because they took that, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlood?\u201dDuncan asked, careful to keep the anger from his voice.</p><p>Violet nodded. \u201cAnd the next night, it started all over again, but the men were worse than before. More violent. I thought they were going to kill us all,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut they only killed poor Lacey.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes flashed immediately to Emma who sat next to a cluttered dining room table behind Violet. She met his gaze, distress in every nuance of her body. He wanted to tell her to leave, that she didn\u2019t need to hear this, but he knew she wouldn\u2019t go. And he wouldn\u2019t ask her to.</p><p>\u201cDid you see what happened to Lacey?\u201d he asked, returning his attention to Violet and making the question sound only mildly curious.</p><p>Violet shook her head. \u201cI was next door. But I heard them. I think . . . I heard one of the other men shout at someone else, saying they\u2019d killed her. He said something like, \u2018You\u2019ve strangled her, you fool.\u2019 And then the man who was with me\u2014I\u2019m ashamed to say I don\u2019t know who he was\u2014anyway, he jumped up and ran into the hallway and everyone started yelling, and then someone punched someone else and I could hear them fighting. And then one of Victor\u2019s guards ran into my room and grabbed me.\u201d She rubbed her arm, as if she could still feel the grip of his hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe dragged me down the hall and threw me into this tiny room with all the other women and locked the door. Lacey was the only one missing. We were all naked, but there was a bed there so we grabbed the sheets and blankets. Two of the women . . . I don\u2019t know their names. Lacey was the only one I knew from before, and none of us used our real names. I think we all knew this was something we wouldn\u2019t want anyone to know about. Anyway, two of the women were unconscious, or at least they weren\u2019t moving anymore. So, I and the other girl wrapped them in the blankets, figuring they needed the extra warmth, and we took the sheets. And that\u2019s all I remember. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a big black spot in my brain, and no matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t put anything in it. I woke up in a car driving back to the District. I was wearing clothes, but they weren\u2019t even mine. One of Victor\u2019s guards dropped me off at my apartment, handed me my purse, and that was it. I went upstairs and . . .\u201d</p><p>Violet bent her head, hiding behind her hair as her eyes closed, her throat working as she struggled to contain her emotions. Duncan felt dirty prying into her heart and soul like this, but he couldn\u2019t help her, couldn\u2019t fix her any other way. And because he was trying to fix her, because he was so tuned in to what she was feeling, he knew her emotions were very much like the ones experienced by women who\u2019d been raped. He\u2019d felt that before, too, in other women he\u2019d rescued over the years. It was combination of shame and guilt, of helplessness, and at the same time, pure, unadulterated rage, sometimes at themselves as much as their rapist.</p><p>\u201cI showered,\u201d Violet whispered. \u201cI showered until every inch of my skin was raw from scrubbing. And then I crawled into my bed and slept. And I never really woke up.\u201d She looked up, meeting Duncan\u2019s gaze. \u201cUntil today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to make you relive all of that,\u201d Duncan said, meeting her eyes and letting his own sorrow show. \u201cBut it\u2019s necessary. I wouldn\u2019t ask it otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Violet nodded. \u201cI know. And I feel better simply knowing it was real, that I\u2019m not losing my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know any of the men, other than Victor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot then. But one of them was that senator you see on the news all the time now, Grafton. My dad\u2019s always saying how the name fits, because politicians are always on the take. I remember two others, but I don\u2019t know their names. One was the creep with me when Lacey died. I\u2019d know his face if I saw it, but I don\u2019t know his name. He was kind of beat up looking, and he drank a lot. He had that smell that alcoholics get. I don\u2019t know what it is, precisely, but I had an uncle who was an alcoholic and he always smelled that way. The man couldn\u2019t . . .\u201d Her face heated with embarrassment, and she looked away.</p><p>\u201cThe man couldn\u2019t get an erection,\u201d Duncan provided. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Violet said, still not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the third man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know his name either, but if I had to guess, I\u2019d say he was a politician of some sort. He had that slick, captain-of-the-football-team personality. He looked like one, too. I remember wondering why a guy that good-looking would need someone like Victor to pimp for him.\u201d</p><p>That description fit too many of the glad-handing politicians in town to be useful, but the alcoholic she\u2019d described . . . that matched the appearance of Congressman Kerwin whom Duncan had last seen at Grafton\u2019s fundraiser, flushed with too much alcohol and staring at Duncan like he\u2019d seen a ghost.</p><p>\u201cBut I never saw the woman,\u201d Violet added unexpectedly.</p><p>Duncan and Emma both stared at her. \u201cWoman?\u201d Duncan said, puzzled. \u201cYou mean one of the other women who were there with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Violet said, shaking her head. \u201cThere was a woman there with Victor. I never did see her; I only heard her voice. She came later, at the end, after Lacey . . .\u201d She frowned and bit the inside of her lip unhappily. \u201cShe was yelling, I mean really angry, like she was in charge or something. It surprised me, because I\u2019d never heard anyone talk that way to Victor before.\u201d</p><p>They took Violet home after that. Emma drove the same SUV, with Violet in the passenger seat up front, but Duncan rode in the back this time. He didn\u2019t say much, but Emma could feel the comfort of his presence behind her, like a banked fire on a cold night. She knew he was probably doing it for Violet\u2019s benefit, but she enjoyed it anyway. And she wondered if he knew what it felt like when he did whatever that was. Had he ever been on the receiving end of it? Had someone taught him how to project that overwhelming sense of safety and security? Or was it instinctive, just a part of who he was?</p><p>Violet\u2019s parents were home when they got there. The porch light was on in welcome, and Emma could see the flickering of a television screen behind the sheers on the front window.</p><p>\u201cWill your parents be worried?\u201d Emma asked, not knowing what Violet had told them. They had to wonder why their daughter, who\u2019d been all but homebound for the last two weeks, would suddenly be out late at night.</p><p>Violet shook her head. \u201cI told them I was going out with a friend. They were thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Emma could understand that. \u201cYou want me to walk in with you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Violet turned in the seat and addressed Duncan. \u201cThank you, Duncan,\u201d she said somberly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you really did today, and I don\u2019t care. You saved my life and that\u2019s all that matters. To me, anyway.\u201d She opened the door and climbed out, then stopped and looked at Emma. \u201cI hope you find whatever you\u2019re looking for, Emma, and I hope it brings you peace.\u201d Then she slammed the door and ran up the stairs, moving with an energy and grace that had been totally lacking a few hours earlier.</p><p>\u201cWill she remember any of this?\u201d Emma asked, watching as Violet disappeared into the house.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cShe\u2019ll wake in the morning and remember being ill, and now she\u2019ll get better.\u201d</p><p>Emma sighed. It was a bittersweet victory. They\u2019d given Violet her life back, but Lacey was still gone. And her killers were still out there. But at least Violet had given them something to go on. Grafton for sure, which they\u2019d already suspected, and the drunk who couldn\u2019t get it up, probably Kerwin. And then there was the woman. Grafton\u2019s wife? Or maybe Tammy Dietrich? Emma sighed. The more they learned, the more complicated everything became.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s warm hand touched her shoulder. \u201cPull over, Emma.\u201d She did so, not even questioning why. Their escort pulled in behind them, and a minute later Ari was knocking on her window. He took over the steering wheel, while Miguel claimed the passenger seat.</p><p>Grumbling all the way, Emma climbed into the backseat with Duncan, but consoled herself by snuggling up close to him. Duncan put his arm around her and gave her a warm kiss that made her hope Ari made Indy 500 time on the drive back to the house. But he was quiet after that, leaving Emma to her own thoughts. Towns and neighborhoods flashed by outside. Ari was driving much faster than she would have dared, especially since a light rain had begun to fall. Apparently he didn\u2019t worry about being pulled over for speeding. Could a vampire talk his way out of a ticket if he did get pulled over? Or maybe they had some sort of diplomatic immunity? And were girlfriends included? That could come in handy.</p><p>They arrived back in the District with hours to spare before sunrise. Ari pulled in behind the house, maneuvering around construction equipment and piles of supplies, gleaming wetly in the headlights. Emma scrambled down from the SUV, frowning at the abundance of construction-related materiel. She knew there were more people, more vampires actually, working on the house than what she saw. She\u2019d seen evidence of the remodeling and sometimes heard them shouting back and forth. But this seemed like an awful lot of stuff. Duncan joined her, his gaze raking over the house and back to her. He smiled, then put a hand low on her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get inside before it starts raining again,\u201d he said, and started walking toward the kitchen door. \u201cAsk Alaric to leave an update for me, please, Miguel,\u201d he called without looking. \u201cAnd tell him I\u2019ll meet him tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be tired,\u201d Duncan said at her ear.</p><p>\u201cNot that tired. Besides, you did all the work,\u201d she murmured back to him.</p> <p>\u201cDid I? Perhaps.\u201d</p><p>Emma frowned, but didn\u2019t say anything else until they had reached Duncan\u2019s suite and closed the bedroom door behind them.</p><p>She unbuttoned her blouse and stepped out of her heels, watching him covertly, admiring the graceful way he moved, even when it was something so prosaic as taking off his jacket and stripping away his sweater. Although, granted, there was nothing prosaic about Duncan\u2019s bare chest. Or his back, either. He was all smooth muscle, long lean stretches of it that came together over broad shoulders and powerful arms. Unable to stop herself, she slipped out of her blouse and crossed the room to him. All of her senses seemed suddenly more concentrated, as if being this close to Duncan brought everything into hyperawareness. The thick carpet was like silk beneath her stockinged feet, her hair almost unbearably warm on her bare shoulders, and the satin of her bra an exquisite torment over her breasts.</p><p>Duncan turned and watched her come toward him, his body perfectly still in a way that was his alone, his eyes glowing a soft bronze in the dim light. He held out a hand when she drew close enough. She placed her fingers in his, feeling the slight roughness of his skin as he closed his hand and drew her into his embrace, circling her waist with his arm and bending his head enough to touch his lips to hers.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he said softly. Just that. Just her name, like a promise.</p> <p>Emma stroked her hand down his face. \u201cWhat Victor did,\u201d she told him quietly, guessing at the source of his discontent from this evening. \u201cThat\u2019s not you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said too quickly.</p><p>\u201cBut you still feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cVictor was one of ours. We should have known what was going on and stopped it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did stop it,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s dead.\u201d She held his gaze. \u201cVictor really is dead, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Duncan studied her for a long moment, as if deciding whether to trust her. Emma held her breath, not only because she wanted Victor to be dead, but more importantly, because she desperately needed Duncan to trust her enough to tell her the truth.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s really dead,\u201d Duncan said flatly. He met her gaze for a moment, then tugged her against his chest. Emma wrapped her arms around him, her eyes filling with tears of relief.</p><p>\u201cI want you to move your things in here, into this room,\u201d Duncan said softly. \u201cFrom the other bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that much here, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. This is your room now.\u201d</p><p>Emma rubbed her fingers up and down his spine absently. Was it simply that Duncan was used to giving orders? Or maybe it was that vampire possessiveness he\u2019d warned her about? And did she really care? After all, it wasn\u2019t like she was moving in lock, stock and barrel. He wasn\u2019t even asking her to do that. It was only a few changes of clothes. She\u2019d done as much with boyfriends in the past, when they\u2019d each kept a few things at each other\u2019s apartment. So why did this time feel different? Stupid question, Emma, she scolded herself. It was different because this time she was in love with the guy. And she had no idea how he felt about her. Oh, sure, he lusted after her, and, yeah, he was possessive as hell. But was that love?</p><p>She sighed. Duncan heard her, obviously. He could hear a pin drop at twenty paces, but more significantly, he understood the emotion behind her sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Emma,\u201d he said softly, but in a voice that brooked no argument. \u201cI want that clear. As long as you\u2019re in this house, as long as we\u2019re together, you\u2019re mine. And no one else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Emma leaned back enough to see his face. \u201cThat goes both ways, vampire. I don\u2019t share either.\u201d</p> <p>A slow grin spread over Duncan\u2019s face, and he drawled, \u201cI\u2019ve barely enough strength for you, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>Emma laughed softly, letting him distract her. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll manage somehow,\u201d she murmured, then reached behind his head and tugged the leather tie off his hair.</p><p>\u201cI keep losing those,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cYou have an entire drawer full of them,\u201d she scoffed, threading her fingers through his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a girl.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s brow arched in disbelief. \u201cGirl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well, it\u2019s just a\u2014\u201d She shrieked in surprise as he spun her around and threw her on the bed. In a flash, he had her bent over the edge, her skirt up around her waist, her panties on the floor. Emma started laughing, but then groaned as his cock pushed past her tender folds and deep into the hungry wet depths of her sex. She hissed in pleasure at how good he felt, how completely he stretched her open and filled her as he began pumping in and out of her with long, graceful strokes. He unclasped her bra and ran a long-fingered hand up her bare spine and she arched her back languorously, opening herself even more to his invasion. He leaned forward over her back and brushed her hair aside as he nuzzled her neck.</p><p>\u201cLet this be a lesson to you,\u201d he whispered flush against her ear. She groaned again as her vulnerable position let him go deeper than he\u2019d ever gone before. He stopped moving abruptly, still buried inside her, nothing but the slightest flex of his hips slipping fractionally back and forth as he held her motionless. \u201cThis, my darling Emmaline, is a cock filling your sweet little pussy. My cock.\u201d</p><p>Emma giggled. \u201cOkay, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do girls have cocks?\u201d he interrupted. \u201cNo, they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Emma rolled her hips gently against his, loving the smooth glide of his thickness inside her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re taking this lesson seriously,\u201d Duncan scolded. Emma yelped a surprised laugh as he slapped her ass smartly and began fucking her in earnest. She closed her eyes and went with it, loving the scrape of the velvet comforter against her hard nipples, the heated friction of his shaft, the zing of blissful sensation as he held onto her hip with one hand while the other reached around to toy with her clit. He bent over her again, his chest to her back, and she felt the warm caress of his tongue along the side of her neck. She shivered expectantly, and everything below her waist began thrumming with eager anticipation. The smooth, firm surface of his fangs brushed against her neck and she shuddered, her heart filling her throat and making it hard to breathe. But who needed to breathe? She only needed Duncan.</p><p>His fangs slipped almost painlessly into the taut skin of her neck, puncturing her vein like the pinch of a needle, quickly forgotten in the rush of exquisite pleasure that roared through her blood. The velvet beneath her breasts became a warm, seductive caress against her swollen nipples, clenching her abdomen and making her pussy shiver in anticipation. Without warning, she exploded in a climax that convulsed every muscle in her body, even as Duncan continued to pound into her, his hips grinding against her ass as he held her open to him. Somewhere in all of that, she was aware of the soft pull of his fangs against her vein, of his deep growl as she bucked beneath him, and then his head lifted and, with a roar of release, he filled her with the hot wash of his climax.</p><p>Emma no longer felt like laughing. Actually, she might have laughed with sheer joy if she\u2019d been able to feel any part of her body, but she was so completely satiated, she couldn\u2019t feel anything at all. Duncan\u2019s cock flexed inside her, and she moaned as her clit sparked an answer. Okay, so not every part of her was numb, after all.</p><p>She felt the warm drizzle of blood slide down her neck a moment before Duncan gave her a sensuous lick and belatedly sealed the twin puncture wounds. He kissed them afterwards, murmuring a quiet apology, but Emma didn\u2019t care. She loved the way he came, loved the feel of his cock pumping inside her, loved that he was so lost in his climax that he forgot to lick the wounds closed. What was a trickle of blood compared to that?</p><p>He straightened, then lifted her from the waist and pulled both of them fully up and onto the bed. Emma sat up enough to peel off the remains of her thigh-high stockings, then collapsed against him, her cheek resting on his muscled shoulder. She flattened her palm over the ridges of his abdomen, stroking with possessive pride. Duncan\u2019s rumble of laughter vibrated beneath her ear.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you do that,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. You read me like a book. Besides, I was just admiring your muscle tone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her palm and slapped the muscles she\u2019d been admiring, but he only laughed harder. Emma smiled. At least he wasn\u2019t sad, like he\u2019d been earlier.</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you actually read my thoughts? I mean, can you?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her closer and touched his lips to her forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. I can easily read the thoughts of any vampire sworn to me, and especially those of my own children, like Miguel and Louis. With humans, it\u2019s the difference between listening to your neighbor\u2019s music, or walking over and turning on your own. I don\u2019t hear every thought, but if necessary, I can delve into almost any human\u2019s brain and know what they\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m also capable of manipulating a human\u2019s thoughts and memories. It can be something as simple as dissuading a cop from giving me a speeding ticket, or as complex as what Victor did in making those women forget. Though I like to think my own manipulations are far more skilled and far less malicious than anything Victor did.\u201d</p><p>He reached down and lifted her chin to look at him. \u201cI would never probe your thoughts without permission, Emma, but you should know that the more blood we exchange, the closer our thoughts will become, and the more open your mind will be to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you already know what I\u2019m thinking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Not really. I\u2019m a fairly strong empath. I read emotion. I\u2019ve always had some ability along those lines, even when I was human. But with becoming a vampire, my ability to read the emotions of others is nearly perfect. And, as I told you when we first met, I have decades of experience reading the human body language that goes with those emotions.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s only the words that are missing.\u201d</p><p>His fingers were still playing along her upper arm, but she felt the rest of him go still, as if waiting for her reaction. She frowned, thinking about what he\u2019d told her, about what it meant. He knew her emotions, her feelings . . . about him. That she loved him. Emma knew she should be embarrassed, but on the other hand, he knew she loved him, and he wasn\u2019t running away screaming. So, okay, then.</p> <p>\u201cHardly seems fair,\u201d she muttered, pulling the small hairs on his chest.</p><p>\u201cOw! What\u2019s not fair?\u201d he asked, rubbing his abused follicles.</p><p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t tell what you\u2019re feeling, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how I feel, Emmaline. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Emma sighed softly. Maybe it was a vampire thing, this whole mine hang-up. \u201cSo, who do you think the woman was?\u201d she asked, changing the subject. \u201cThe one Violet heard yelling that night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTammy Dietrich seems likely,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cPowerful men always call their lawyers first when they get into trouble. And it might explain why she was at Lacey\u2019s service. Grafton would have been too obvious, but Dietrich could show up to check things out, and no one would notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would she sign the mourner\u2019s book? It would have been smarter not to leave a record like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows? Force of habit? Maybe there was someone who knew her and she thought it would look odd if she didn\u2019t sign it. Besides, who looks at those things afterward? She probably didn\u2019t give it a second thought. They had to have known by then that Victor had disappeared, or at least couldn\u2019t be reached. And with Lacey\u2019s body being found, I\u2019m sure they were eager to know what story was being given for her death, and whether the police were involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s one thing we all agree on. No police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo police,\u201d Duncan confirmed. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Emma said firmly. \u201cLacey was my friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not a killer, Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I need to be, yes.\u201d</p><p>Emma considered all the years Duncan had been alive, and how different justice might have been back . . . She frowned. Back when?</p><p>\u201cHow old are you, Duncan?\u201d she asked, wondering if he\u2019d tell her. \u201cI mean how old are you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born in 1836.\u201d</p><p>The unreality of that took Emma\u2019s breath away for a moment. Duncan was nearly two hundred years old, which meant that even when he\u2019d been human, he was already old enough to be married, to have children, especially back then.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a family? I mean before you became a vampire. Were you ever married?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, then he got up and left the bed. Emma thought she\u2019d gone too far, that she\u2019d touched on another vampire taboo, or maybe something that was too painful for him to think about. Duncan crossed over to a tall dresser, opened the top drawer, and removed a wooden box about the size of an old cigar box. Emma watched curiously as he lifted the lid and took something out, then stood staring down at whatever it was before finally turning and coming back to the bed.</p><p>He held it out to her, and she saw it was an old-fashioned photograph, the kind they called a daguerreotype. It was a portrait of a young woman and two small children\u2014a boy somewhere around four years old, and a second child of indeterminate sex, maybe a year old, sitting on the woman\u2019s lap. Emma stared at the photograph, then looked up at Duncan.</p><p>\u201cMy wife and children,\u201d he said simply. \u201cThey died while I was at war.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s heart clenched in sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were murdered.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in sudden understanding. All along, Duncan had been the only one who understood her need for revenge, her need to be a part of the search for Lacey\u2019s killer. And maybe that was because he knew firsthand the thirst for justice, not at the hands of the law, with its process and protections for the killers, but up close and personal. The biblical, eye for an eye, cold-blooded vengeance.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>1836, Nashville Basin, Tennessee</p><p>Duncan stared at the ruin of what had once been his family home. It looked old and tired, despite the cover of night. It had never been a grand building, but it had been filled with life once upon a time. No more. He was the last of his line, and now that he was Vampire there would be no one after him. And no one to care either way.</p><p>It had taken him and Raphael several nights to get this far. Raphael had told him that their ultimate path was westward, all the way to the western ocean. The journey back to what had been Duncan\u2019s home was a detour, but Raphael had never voiced a word of protest. He\u2019d seemed to accept Duncan\u2019s need for vengeance as if it were his own. At first, Duncan had thought it was simply the bond between a vampire and his child, but he\u2019d soon realized it was more than that. It was a measure of the man Raphael had been and the vampire lord he had become. He would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those he took for his own. And Duncan felt the ties of loyalty growing stronger with each step he took beside the vampire who was now, and forever would be, his Sire.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Raphael asked quietly, staring at the abandoned house.</p><p>\u201cThis infernal war happened,\u201d Duncan said. He walked over to the tall chestnut tree in the front yard, bent over and picked up the torn remains of a thick rope. It had adorned the tree once upon a time, a swing fashioned anew every spring for his children to play on. He dropped the rope into the dirt and turned away, heading back toward the road and the nearby town.</p><p>Raphael kept pace with him without comment, though Duncan could feel his Sire\u2019s curiosity through the bond they now shared. It was a strange feeling to be so tied to another man, but there was nothing sexual about it. If anything, it made him stronger, as if Raphael were a reservoir of strength that Duncan could borrow from at will. Or perhaps it was the certain knowledge that Raphael would always stand with him against his enemies. And those enemies were in the town a few miles down the road.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t join the army at first,\u201d Duncan said as they kept walking. \u201cThe people around here were as content to remain with the Union as not, and many of us felt it wasn\u2019t our battle. But then the Confederacy came looking for troops and we had to choose.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe voted and the Confederacy won, or so the town fathers told us. I\u2019ve no idea if they were truthful in that, or if it simply suited their interests better to have it so. In any event, those of us young enough and strong enough were recruited and sent off to be soldiers. And we were given assurances that our families would not suffer, that the town would stand together.\u201d</p><p>Duncan bent and picked up a rock, bouncing it in his hand as they walked.</p><p>\u201cAnd did they?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>Duncan considered the question. \u201cThey stood together. But not in the way I expected. My wife was a beautiful woman and I was a poor farmer. She married beneath her station in taking me for a husband, but she loved me, and God knows I loved her. There are times I think she\u2019d still be alive if she\u2019d married someone wealthier, or just someone else.\u201d He sent the rock arching into the moonlit darkness of the surrounding field. \u201cBefore we married, she had a suitor. The banker\u2019s son, a young man of money and privilege whom she rejected in my favor. He was offended, of course, and while I was gone to war, he came to our house, drunk and angry at what he considered her humiliation of him.\u201d</p><p>It was not necessary to spell out what had happened next. Any man would know without being told what would have come of such an encounter.</p><p>\u201cYour children?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cMy son tried to protect his mother and was clubbed aside. My daughter was a baby, little more than a year old, not even walking yet when I saw her last. She lay next to her mother for days before anyone discovered what had happened. My wife\u2019s father came looking for her eventually and found them like that. The children were dead, my wife nearly so. But before she died, she told him what had happened, and who had done it. He went to the town law, but the brute was long gone, sent off to the war before his crime could be exposed. I was sent for, of course, but returned only in time to visit their graves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is this killer still alive?\u201d Raphael asked in a cold voice.</p><p>\u201cHe is. But not much longer.\u201d</p><p>Raphael grunted his agreement. They walked another mile in silence, until the buildings of the town came into sight, candlelight flickering in distant windows. They stopped on the outskirts of town, and Raphael did a slow turn as he surveyed the cluster of buildings. \u201cHis house is here somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father\u2019s house.That one, near the stand of hickory trees. You can\u2019t see it from here, but there\u2019s a small lake, too. It\u2019s quite lovely in the summer, though the common folk are discouraged from using it now. It was open for all before he built his house there.\u201d</p><p>The banker\u2019s house was brightly lit, lanterns burning on the porch, candles glimmering in every window. Duncan started for the steps, Raphael beside him. They reached the front door and rang the small bell hanging to one side. This was the part of their plan that had Duncan most concerned. The banker\u2019s house was a private residence, which meant, as vampires, he and Raphael would need to be invited inside.</p><p>A uniformed maid opened the door. She was young and pretty, and African, which meant she was probably a house slave. She stared up at them, her gaze going from their faces to their dusty clothes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re invited guests, child,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cInvite us in.\u201d</p><p>Duncan jerked in surprise, but the slave continued to stare up at the big vampire lord, her eyes blank and unfocused, until she smiled and said, \u201cCome in, gentlemen. I\u2019ll tell the master you\u2019ve arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster indeed,\u201d Raphael muttered, but he smiled at the young slave. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>She blushed, ducking her head with pleasure as they walked past her into the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your . . . master?\u201d Raphael asked smoothly.</p><p>\u201cIn the library, sirs. Shall I show you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be most kind. Duncan?\u201d</p><p>They followed the slave down a short hallway to the back of the house. She stopped in front of a pair of doors and was about to knock when Raphael took her hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to trouble yourself, child. Go back to your chores.\u201d</p> <p>The young slave\u2019s eyes took on that unfocused look again, and then she turned and walked away, as if they weren\u2019t even there.</p><p>Raphael watched her go, then caught Duncan\u2019s gaze. \u201cThe banker is alone in there, but there are others in the house.\u201d</p><p>Duncan wiped his hands nervously on his filthy pant legs and tried to calm his galloping heart. He wanted to do this right, not just for his own vengeance, but to prove to Raphael that he hadn\u2019t made a mistake in choosing Duncan out of all the dying men on that battlefield. Earning Raphael\u2019s respect had somehow become the most important thing in his life, and he couldn\u2019t help wondering if these new feelings were part of the bond of which Raphael had spoken.</p><p>Raphael pulled open the doors and stepped into the library. He radiated strength and confidence, dominating the room not just with his formidable size, but with the power that fairly poured off of him. It was so strong that Duncan thought he would see the glow of it if he concentrated hard enough. But then the banker spoke, and Duncan had eyes for only the man whose son had killed his family.</p><p>\u201cMilford?\u201d the banker said, his thick body almost vibrating with its outrage. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour son killed my family,\u201d he told the banker calmly. \u201cI want to know where he is.\u201d</p> <p>The banker leaned back in his chair, full of confident disdain. \u201cYou want money, is that it?\u201d He stretched forward again and opened a desk drawer, pulling out a metal lockbox. The key was in the lock and he turned it, flipping the lid back to reveal a considerable amount of gold coin. \u201cHow much, Milford?\u201d</p><p>Duncan stared at him. After months on the battlefield, he thought he\u2019d seen the deepest depths to which a man could sink. But this . . . this cur thought gold could compensate him for the loss of his family?</p><p>\u201cCome on, boy. Everyone has a price. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have a price,\u201d Duncan said, enunciating each word with precision, so there could be no doubt. \u201cAnd that is an eye for an eye. I want the life of your son.\u201d</p><p>The banker flicked his hand at Duncan in dismissal. \u201cDon\u2019t be absurd. Besides, he\u2019s not here. He went off to the army like everyone else. I have no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>Raphael made an impatient gesture and the banker stopped talking mid-sentence, his eyes bulging from his head as he struggled to speak. Fear sent rivulets of sweat dripping down his face, staining the starched collar of his shirt, which he wrenched open in his fruitless efforts to free his voice. His gaze switched frantically from Raphael to Duncan and back again.</p><p>Duncan could hear the man\u2019s labored breath sawing in and out of his lungs, the squeak of his fingers on the wooden chair arms. He could smell the rank odor of sweat, the stink of garlic on the banker\u2019s breath as he panted in fear. But more than that . . . he tilted his head curiously.</p><p>\u201cI can feel his fear, my lord,\u201d he whispered to Raphael. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if my own heart is racing, my gut churning with terror. But . . . there is no guilt. He feels only a righteous anger, as if he is the one being wronged.\u201d</p> <p>Next to him, Raphael nodded. \u201cEmpathy. You must have experienced it as a human, but your rebirth has expanded it. It is an excellent talent to have, Duncan. It will serve us both quite well in the future.\u201d</p><p>Duncan bared his teeth at the banker. His brand new fangs slid into view, and he felt the man\u2019s fear intensify in a most satisfactory manner. Duncan had never been a particularly violent man. Always willing to defend what was his, he\u2019d nonetheless found it easier to persuade rather than fight, and he\u2019d always been able to find the words to work things out.</p><p>But right now, seeing this man he\u2019d once thought powerful tremble in fear at the sight of Duncan himself . . . it felt good. It felt right.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lying,\u201d Raphael said casually, reaching across the desk to help himself to the money box and all its gold. \u201cHis son is in the house.\u201d His gaze shifted to the right, staring at the wall as if he could see through the intervening wood and plaster. He smiled slightly. \u201cRight down the hall, as a matter-of-fact.\u201d He snapped his gaze back to the banker. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>The banker fell forward, his head hitting desk and bouncing once as he fell into unconsciousness. Duncan looked up at Raphael. \u201cYou learned of his son\u2019s presence from his thoughts, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Raphael agreed. \u201cThe thoughts of sniveling men are easily spied upon. This way, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>They hurried back to the hallway, back the way they\u2019d come only a short time ago. They met no one, not even the maid, as Raphael turned down yet another hallway, this one narrower than the first, and went directly to a closed door. There was a sputtering candle in a single hurricane lamp on a shelf opposite the door, but other than that, the hallway was barely lit.</p><p>Steeling himself for a confrontation, Duncan pulled his knife and opened the door. He ducked as he entered, expecting a rifle blast to greet him, if indeed this was the killer he sought. But the room was completely dark and nothing but a surprised grunt greeted his arrival.</p><p>Duncan felt a wave of Raphael\u2019s power roll past him. Candles flared, and the man he sought was revealed, hiding in the dark. He was in bed, covers drawn up to his chest, propped up on his elbows as he squinted at the intruders.</p><p>\u201cMilford,\u201d the man said. \u201cI\u2019d hoped you were dead.\u201d He sighed, then pushed himself up higher against the wall behind the bed, and asked wearily, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Duncan stared at the killer, his gaze taking in the man\u2019s well-muscled shoulders beneath his nightshirt, then down to his legs still covered by the blankets. He raised his eyes to meet those of the killer who was staring back at him defiantly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m a cripple now, but I\u2019m still ten times the man you\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a killer and a rapist, lower than the cockroach that lives in shit.\u201d</p><p>The killer shrugged. \u201cAre we finished here then? Because I\u2019m tired.\u201d Raphael stepped into the light, and the killer looked up at him. \u201cBrought someone to do your dirty work for you? It figures.\u201d</p><p>Raphael took in the killer\u2019s shriveled legs beneath the blanket and laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this before, Duncan. His cock\u2019s probably as useless as his legs now. There\u2019s a certain justice in that.\u201d</p><p>Duncan fingered the blade in his right hand. He nodded. \u201cJustice, my lord,\u201d he agreed, then took two quick steps forward and stabbed the killer in the chest, the narrow blade of the knife slicing easily through flesh and into the man\u2019s heart. Red blood bloomed on the white linen of his nightshirt, and the man howled, staring in shock from Duncan\u2019s hand, still fisted around the blade\u2019s hilt, to his face.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not justice I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Duncan growled. \u201cIt\u2019s vengeance.\u201d</p><p>He waited until life left the killer\u2019s eyes, until his body slumped heavily against his hand, then pulled the knife out and lifted the sheet to clean the blade. Sliding the knife back into its sheath, he realized he\u2019d just killed a man in cold blood, and yet he felt nothing but satisfaction. Surely he should feel some guilt, some conflict at least between his desire for vengeance and this blunt execution? Was this what it meant to be Vampire? Was he truly human no longer?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still human after a fashion, Duncan,\u201d Raphael said, as if reading his mind. \u201cBut we\u2019re more, as well. For a vampire, there is no gray, only black and white. If a man takes something that is mine, if he harms someone I care about, or steals something I value, he dies. It\u2019s a simpler life, but more brutal as well. Some of us revel in it; others choose to live much as humans do. There is no way of knowing before a person\u2019s rebirth how things will turn out, but I am pleased to see that I was right about you. You have power and talent, and you do not flinch in the face of your enemy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, Duncan, because I intend to rule this continent someday. I\u2019ll need someone like you at my side.\u201d</p><p>Duncan turned to face his Sire. He heard the sincerity in the vampire lord\u2019s words. More than that, he felt the emotion that went with it and knew Raphael was speaking only the truth. He took a step back and gave a courtly bow from the waist.</p><p>\u201cI am honored to serve you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael grinned and slapped Duncan on the shoulder. \u201cThen let\u2019s get out of this place. The sight of a dead enemy is satisfying, but the stink is less welcome.\u201d</p><p>They were both laughing as they started down the road, breathing in the fresh, night air. Duncan strode proudly next to his Sire, and for the first time since his family had died, he knew he had something to live for.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever look back and regret it?\u201d Emma asked. They were lying side by side again, and she raised herself up on one elbow to look into Duncan\u2019s face when he answered her.</p><p>He shook his head, meeting Emma\u2019s clear violet gaze head-on. And he told her the same thing Raphael had told him as they left that house all those years ago. \u201cThere are some things that cannot be forgiven if a man is to live with himself, some actions that define who we are. That man raped my wife, murdered her and my children. I could not let him live and consider myself a man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma nodded, then rested her head on Duncan\u2019s shoulder once again. She placed her hand over his heart. \u201cThat goes for a woman, too, you know. I can\u2019t forget that Lacey\u2019s killer is out there. I can\u2019t live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to, Emmaline. Neither one of us will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p> <p>Emma went to work the next day, although she was no longer sure why she bothered. She was there in body, but that was it. Every time someone asked her a question, she had to play back in her head whatever it was they\u2019d said, then remind herself of where she was before answering. That left her staring blankly at either her computer or the person who\u2019d spoken while she tried to catch up. So it didn\u2019t even surprise her when Sharon Coffer stopped by her desk and asked her to step into the Congressman\u2019s office. Although asked was a polite way of putting it. It was more of a command performance.</p><p>Guy Coffer was out, so Emma and Sharon had the spacious office to themselves. Emma knew she was in trouble when Sharon closed the door deliberately before walking over to sit behind the desk. That was something even the most senior staffers would never have dared, but it had been clear to Emma from the beginning that Sharon considered this as much her office as her husband\u2019s, that Guy Coffer\u2019s election was as much about Sharon as it was about Guy. He just happened to have the more photogenic face, and more charisma in his little finger than existed in Sharon\u2019s entire body.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Sharon said, indicating the chair in front of the desk. Emma sat dutifully. \u201cWe were all very sorry to hear about Laney\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLacey,\u201d Emma corrected.</p><p>Sharon\u2019s expression tightened, her eyes narrowing to slits, but her voice was all smoothness and light when she continued, \u201cOf course. Lacey. We were all sorry about her death, and we all know the strain you\u2019ve been under.\u201d Sharon paused as if expecting Emma to say something, but Emma didn\u2019t know what that something should be, so she remained silent.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Sharon went on, her tone making it clear she didn\u2019t consider it unfortunate at all, \u201cthe business of this office must continue. And I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not keeping up. I\u2019m sure you understand. Once you\u2019ve packed your things, someone will have to escort you out of the building and, of course, confiscate your ID.\u201d</p><p>Emma blinked, not certain she\u2019d heard that right. \u201cAre you firing me?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re letting you go, yes. The Congressman will, of course, provide you with a letter of reference, and I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll have no difficulty finding another position once your personal situation clears up. But until then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re firing me?\u201d Emma repeated, still not believing what she\u2019d heard. \u201cMy best friend dies, and you\u2019re firing me because I\u2019m distracted?\u201d</p><p>Sharon\u2019s mouth pursed in distaste. \u201cReally, Emma, there\u2019s no need for hysterics.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t conceal the hint of satisfaction in her expression. This was a day Sharon Coffer had probably dreamt of. The day she finally got rid of Emma Duquet, who clearly had designs on Guy Coffer, and whose biggest sin was being better looking than Sharon. By a fucking mile.</p><p>Emma stood, refusing to give the bitch any more pleasure than she was already getting from this. \u201cYou have my address,\u201d she said flatly, then turned and walked out of the office. Noreen watched with wide eyes as Emma went directly to her desk and began gathering up the few personal items she kept there.</p> <p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Noreen asked.</p><p>\u201cThe bitch fired me,\u201d Emma said, through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently having my best friend die is too inconvenient. Business must go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Emma looked up and gave the other woman a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Noreen. I\u2019ve faced worse than this and come out okay. I\u2019ll do it again.&gt;</p><p>Brave words, she thought to herself as she stashed her stuff in her oversized purse. Jobs like hers were hard to find and nearly impossible to get, and Sharon knew that. All that bullshit about a letter of reference . . . Oh, sure, there\u2019d be a letter, and it would say all the right things. But behind Emma\u2019s back, Sharon Coffer would be poisoning the well.</p><p>She pulled out all the drawers one last time, then slung her bag over her shoulder and grabbed her laptop and her jacket. She gave Noreen a quick hug, took a final look around, and walked out the door for the last time. If Sharon wanted someone to escort her out of the building, they could damn well catch up.</p> <p>No one came after her, so Emma kept walking, all the way out of the building and into the parking lot. She threw her purse across the seat, and her laptop followed albeit somewhat more carefully. Emma got behind the wheel and twisted the key. Still no one in sight, and she wasn\u2019t going to wait.</p><p>She pulled out of the parking lot and drove through the snarl of D.C. traffic, trying to decide where to go. Her heart wanted to rush back to Duncan, to rant and rave until the calm that surrounded him penetrated her anger and made her see that the world wasn\u2019t going to end because she\u2019d lost a job. Rationally, she already knew that, but she was so damn angry. Anyway, it was daytime and Duncan was sound asleep. She thought about joining him, but she hadn\u2019t slept through the day with him yet. It seemed even more intimate than what they had done together in his bed. It was probably silly, but she felt as if he needed to invite her to sleep next to him when he was that vulnerable. Not that she couldn\u2019t be trusted. Hell, he was probably safer with her there with him than not, but she had a gut feeling that he needed to be the one to take that first step.</p><p>So where to go? She was too tired to sleep, even if she used the other bedroom, and besides, the residence would seem far too empty without any of the vampires around. There were human guards on the grounds during the day, but from what she\u2019d seen in the morning as she left for work, they stayed outside the house. For that matter, she wasn\u2019t even absolutely certain the guards would let her back inside before sunset.</p><p>So she turned away from the vampires\u2019 residence and headed for her own house instead. Duncan wouldn\u2019t be happy that she was going there alone, but he\u2019d admitted that the guy the other night had been a common burglar, not some assassin sent to take her out. And there were practicalities to deal with. Her mail, and Lacey\u2019s, too, would be piling up, and there were bills to pay. And now that she didn\u2019t have a job, she needed to update her resume and start looking for something new. It was also time to let her landlord know that she wouldn\u2019t be renewing the lease on the house. Even if she\u2019d been able to get past Lacey\u2019s absence, she simply couldn\u2019t afford the place on her own. Especially not if she had to go a few months without income.</p><p>Emma found a space on the street right in front of her house with no problem, because unlike her, most of her neighbors still had jobs. She had turned off the ignition and was pulling her keys out, when a familiar looking SUV parked right behind her. It was one of Duncan\u2019s. He\u2019d had someone following her the other day, and apparently he still did. So much for going it alone. She sighed and glanced in the rearview mirror, but the SUV\u2019s windows were tinted. She couldn\u2019t see the driver, but didn\u2019t expect to recognize him anyway. She was more familiar with the vamps than the human guards. Grabbing her stuff, she walked back to the driver\u2019s side of the SUV and waited while he slid down the window.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she greeted him.</p><p>\u201cMs. Duquet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pack some boxes and things. You want to come inside?\u201d</p><p>He turned off the truck\u2019s engine. \u201cI\u2019ll walk in with you, make sure everything\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure everything\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll respect, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t work for you.\u201d</p><p>Emma blinked and thought it was too bad Baldwin wasn\u2019t around. At least he was fun. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and walked away, pulling out the key to the new lock that Duncan had ordered installed. Mr. Grumpy could follow at his own pace.</p><p>As expected, there was a pile of mail on the floor inside the front door. She dropped her keys in the dish, set her bag and laptop on the stairs and gathered up the whole mess. Shuffling it into a more or less neat stack, she headed for the kitchen. Duncan\u2019s guard came in behind her and went immediately upstairs to check everything out. Emma rolled her eyes and stopped long enough to grab the remote and turn on the TV, more for company than anything else. She had a feeling her bodyguard wasn\u2019t going to be too chatty.</p><p>She dumped the mail onto the tiled countertop and noticed the message waiting light blinking on her answering machine. The machine itself was a leftover from when she and Lacey had lived together in college, before they\u2019d been able to afford cell service. When they\u2019d moved to D.C., they\u2019d both gotten cell numbers, but their Internet service had been provided over a landline, so they\u2019d automatically hooked up the machine. No one had ever called the number except telemarketers, and even they stopped calling after the first year.</p><p>So now Emma stared at the blinking light for a few seconds before she registered its significance. Someone had called her home phone. It was probably nothing but a junk call triggered by Lacey\u2019s funeral notice, except that the phone was in her name, not Lacey\u2019s, and she\u2019d automatically used her cell number on all the required forms.</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out,\u201d she muttered and punched the button. The machine\u2019s mechanical voice confirmed that there was a single message and gave the date and time of the call, then the message began to play.</p><p>\u201cMs. Duquet,\u201d a woman\u2019s husky voice said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never met, but you came by my office in Alexandria two days ago.\u201d Emma snatched her hand away from the machine, as if the caller had reached out and zapped her. Alexandria. That had to be Tammy Dietrich. There must have been video monitoring in the reception area. How else could Dietrich have known she\u2019d been there? More importantly, why was she calling Emma, and why on this number? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI tried calling you at Guy Coffer\u2019s office,\u201d Dietrich continued, \u201cbut you were out, and they couldn\u2019t . . . or perhaps wouldn\u2019t . . . say when you\u2019d be back. I didn\u2019t leave a message with them for reasons . . . well, for reasons I\u2019d rather not discuss on an answering machine.\u201d</p><p>Dietrich inhaled deeply, and Emma realized she was smoking a cigarette. That explained the rough quality of her voice, but not perhaps the tension that underlay every syllable she spoke.</p><p>\u201cCall me, Ms. Duquet,\u201d Dietrich said bluntly. \u201cBut use a phone you can trust absolutely. Don\u2019t use your personal cell, don\u2019t use this line either. I\u2019d recommend a pay phone, if you can find one, or a prepaid cell phone. I\u2019m leaving you a number, but don\u2019t bother trying to track it. I\u2019ve taken my own advice and will dispose of the phone if I don\u2019t hear from you within forty-eight hours. Call me. You\u2019ll be glad you did.\u201d</p> <p>The machine beeped loudly, announcing the end. Emma stared, then scrambled frantically to replay Dietrich\u2019s message. She hadn\u2019t paid any attention to the date and time stamp, didn\u2019t know for sure if the clock was even set on the machine. Damnit! Why hadn\u2019t the woman called her cell? Okay, fine, she didn\u2019t want it traced, but couldn\u2019t she at least have given Emma a head\u2019s up? Her fingers were shaking as she found the right button and hit replay.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Emma shrieked and spun around, having forgotten all about Duncan\u2019s guard.</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a cell phone?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cWell, yeah, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to me,\u201d she said, punching the replay button on the answering machine, which dutifully informed her that Dietrich\u2019s lone message had come in last night. While Emma and Duncan had been with Violet. Did Dietrich know about Violet? Was that why she\u2019d called? To warn them away from the young woman? Was Violet in danger because of what they\u2019d done? No, that didn\u2019t make sense. If she\u2019d already talked to them, there was nothing to gain by getting rid of her. The smart move now would be to get rid of Emma and Duncan. Maybe that\u2019s what Dietrich was doing. Setting Emma up to be eliminated.</p><p>The message wound down to the phone number Dietrich had left and Emma wrote it down, then turned to the guard who eyed her as if she\u2019d lost her mind.</p><p>\u201cPhone?\u201d she asked impatiently.</p><p>He studied her for a minute, then handed it over. There was no way her enemies could know to monitor this particular guard\u2019s cell phone, so it should be safe. She punched in the numbers quickly, then waited while it rang and rang. She\u2019d almost given up when Dietrich\u2019s raspy voice answered. \u201cAbout time, Duquet.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s stomach sank. \u201cHow\u2019d you know it was me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I gave this number to,\u201d Dietrich said dryly. \u201cThat was the whole point.\u201d</p><p>Right. \u201cI got your message,\u201d Emma said tightly. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to see me,\u201d Dietrich reminded her. \u201cAs it happens, however, I have some free advice for you. Get out of town. You and your boyfriend both. Go as far and as fast you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Dietrich. This is Tammy Dietrich, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it in one, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sweetheart, I don\u2019t know what game you\u2019re playing, but I\u2019m not leaving until\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dietrich laughed bitterly. \u201cThis is no game. Max doesn\u2019t play games. He never did. He simply clears the board until he gets his way, and you, Duquet, are in his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax Grafton? Your brother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHalf brother, but who\u2019s counting. I don\u2019t have time for this. I called to give you a warning and I\u2019ve given it. I wanted to talk to you at Lacey\u2019s service, but there were too many people around. So I\u2019m telling you now. Your life is in danger, and dying won\u2019t bring Lacey back. That\u2019s it, Duquet. That\u2019s all she wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! How do I get in touch with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. I told you, I\u2019m taking my own advice. I\u2019m going to dig a hole somewhere far away and crawl into it, and hope to hell Max never finds me. Good-bye, Ms. Duquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Emma cried again, but Dietrich was gone. Emma gave a wordless shout of frustration and spun on the guard. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarlon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long \u2018til sunset, Marlon?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his watch. \u201cTwo hours, give or take, probably less.\u201d</p><p>Emma thought for less than a minute. Getting out of town wasn\u2019t even a consideration, especially without Duncan. And she would bet a year\u2019s salary that the vampire lord had absolutely no intention of leaving, not because of Max Grafton or anyone else. But as powerful as Duncan was, he bled and he could die.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving, Marlon. Duncan\u2019s in danger.\u201d</p><p>Marlon didn\u2019t waste words. He grabbed her arm and hustled her out of the kitchen and through the living room, where the local TV news was covering a story about an explosion and fire somewhere in the District. They were calling it terrorism, which was the first thing everyone thought of these days, whether or not it was. Emma reached out as Marlon dragged her past, intending to turn off the TV, when she recognized . . .</p><p>\u201cMarlon,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>Something in her voice stopped the hard charging guard. He turned to stare at the same horrifying image on the television screen that had caught her attention. It was Duncan\u2019s house. And it was on fire.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Emma felt like she was dying. If she had gone directly to Duncan\u2019s after leaving work, maybe she\u2019d have been there in time to have stopped whatever this was. She needed to get to the house, needed to see for herself what was going on and how bad it was. Duncan and his vampires were all there, helpless in sleep. Was the house burning around them? Were they dying as she and Marlon raced through the D.C. streets? She didn\u2019t believe it, couldn\u2019t believe it. Deep in her heart, she was sure she\u2019d know if anything had happened to Duncan. He was too important, too alive, to die without causing even a ripple in reality, certainly in Emma\u2019s reality. But what if he wasn\u2019t dead, but badly injured? What would she do then? Every vampire she knew was with him. Whom could she call for help? When Baldwin was shot, it was Duncan who brought him back with his blood. But who would be there to bring Duncan back?</p><p>She gripped the padded handle of the door as Marlon sped down side streets to avoid traffic, taking every turn with a squeal of tires. Emma had the local news channel up on her cell phone, the same one they\u2019d watched back at her house. The station was running a live feed from the scene, but it didn\u2019t show her enough. She needed details, closeups. She screamed at the screen every time they broke away to the useless news anchors, who did nothing but repeat what she already knew. The authorities were on the scene and refused to speculate on the cause, but that didn\u2019t stop information from leaking. This was Washington, after all. The leading theory was a gas explosion of some kind. But was it an accident or intentional? Speculation was running wild. All the embassies in the area had shut down tight.</p><p>There was no mention of anyone being hurt, but there wouldn\u2019t be. Duncan and his vampires could all be dead and no one would know it until sunset. Emma swallowed hard, refusing to give in to the terror screaming at the back of her brain. She squinted at the tiny images on the video, comparing what she was seeing to what she knew of the house and its layout, trying to determine which part of the house was burning. A gas explosion could be anywhere, and the house was half-empty. But the images she saw were from the street, and the flames and destruction were very visible, which meant the front of the house was involved. And Duncan\u2019s bedroom looked out over the green expanse of the front lawn. Emma turned the phone face down on her thigh and looked away. She couldn\u2019t watch it anymore. She needed to see for herself.</p><p>She closed her eyes and half-listened to Marlon, who was on the phone, trying to reach his supervisor, the guy in charge of the daytime guards, but so far he\u2019d had no luck. The guard commander was far too busy dealing with the emergency to worry about Marlon and Emma. But then she heard Marlon tell someone they were on their way back.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here with me. Yeah, five minutes tops.\u201d He paused, then, \u201cWhy the fuck not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Emma demanded. \u201cPut it on speaker, damnit.\u201d</p><p>Marlon gave her a harassed look, but said, \u201cWait. I\u2019m going to speaker. It\u2019s my boss,\u201d he added for Emma\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cMs. Duquet?\u201d The voice that came out of the speaker was deep and controlled. The voice of authority.</p><p>\u201cCall me Emma. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Emma, the fire department wants to enter the residence, and I can\u2019t permit that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Say that again? Are you telling me no one\u2019s fighting the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re on the scene and they\u2019ve got hoses going full-bore, but they want to get inside the house. Lord Duncan himself has given me very specific orders that no one, under any circumstances, is permitted inside the house during the day.\u201d</p><p>Emma listened with half an ear, her brain racing. It had to be an embassy thing. Embassies were considered the foreign government\u2019s sovereign territory and everyone treated the vampires\u2019 residence like an embassy. She could see why there might be some confusion, but . . .</p><p>\u201cOkay, I understand that,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cBut this is an emergency. Surely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one, under any circumstances,\u201d he repeated firmly. \u201cExcept you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one allowed inside during daylight. Even I\u2019m not allowed to go in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, but that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStandard procedure, ma\u2019am. And the press is all over this. I\u2019d rather not say more until we can speak in person.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma looked up as they finally made the turn onto Duncan\u2019s street and the house came into view. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d she breathed. Then to the guard captain, \u201cWe\u2019re coming up on the gate now, can you get us inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. But, Marlon, you\u2019ll have to park outside.\u201d His voice started jumping, as if he was running. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to the gate. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Marlon double-parked as close to the gate as he could get, then wrapped a meaty arm around her waist and all but carried her forward. He had to shove his way through the crowd, ignoring angry shouts and demands from uniformed police that they stop. The only thing that was going to stop them was a bullet, and no policeman would risk shooting them in this crowd. She hoped.</p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d Marlon said, shouting to be heard above the noise of the crowd and the firefighting trucks and equipment ranged inside the estate walls. They might not be able to get inside the house, but they certainly weren\u2019t giving up on fighting it from the outside.</p> <p>A tall, exotic-looking black man waved at them as he stepped over to the policeman guarding the open gate and said a few words. The officer looked up, then lowered his head and triggered his shoulder radio. Almost instantly, a hole opened up in the throng to disgorge two burly cops who hustled Emma and Marlon past the wall.</p><p>\u201cMs. Duquet,\u201d the black man said. \u201cI\u2019m Jackson Hissong, Lord Duncan\u2019s Chief of Daylight Security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Emma,\u201d she reminded him, shaking his hand quickly. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d She ran alongside Hissong as he spun and jogged over the lawn to the front of the house where some sort of command post had been set up.</p><p>\u201cFirst, you need to back me up with the fire captain. They cannot go in that house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Jackson, this isn\u2019t even a real embassy, and I\u2019m not sure what the law says about a situation like this, even if it was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a lawyer, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t have any authority to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough. You\u2019re acting as Lord Duncan\u2019s agent in this, and as the only individual authorized to enter the premises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, maybe I should tell the fire department it\u2019s okay for them to enter, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hissong said, stopping to regard her steadily. \u201cYou absolutely cannot do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if Duncan and the others are in there and they\u2019re hurt?\u201d Emma asked, anguished.</p> <p>\u201cLord Duncan knows the risks better than you do, and I\u2019ve trained with Miguel for ten years. This isn\u2019t a matter of some lame protocol or diplomatic immunity. This is a vampire\u2019s residence. I already have private fire contractors on their way, but in the meantime, if those guys\u2014\u201d He gestured at the firefighters all around them. \u201c\u2014break into that house, the vampires inside will be completely vulnerable. And what if that was the plan? Most of them are probably decent, courageous public servants doing a dangerous job. But what if just one of them isn\u2019t who he seems to be? He goes in there, finds the vampires and\u2014\u201d He slapped his hands together, making Emma jump in surprise. \u201cThat fast, Emma. It\u2019s all over. There\u2019s a reason for these restrictions. Lord Duncan\u2019s a smart man, and so\u2019s Miguel. You have to trust them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts, babe. You back me up, or you don\u2019t talk to the fire captain at all. There\u2019s no other option.\u201d</p><p>Emma scowled. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a heart attack,\u201d Hissong replied.</p><p>Emma looked away, staring at the house. The fire seemed to be under control, but what did she know about things like that? They were still spraying water, and men were still working all around the wreckage. Her heart stopped as she recognized what she was seeing. That was Duncan\u2019s room. Or it had been. The explosion had gone off right beneath the room she and Duncan shared, blowing out windows and ripping out big chunks of the wall. She couldn\u2019t see into the house, couldn\u2019t tell if Duncan was there\u2014the hole wasn\u2019t that big and there was water spraying everywhere, and too much equipment in the way.</p><p>Tammy Dietrich\u2019s warning that they were in danger came back to her. But she didn\u2019t trust Dietrich. Maybe the phone call had been a ploy to get Emma back here in time to die in the explosion herself.</p><p>She looked at Jackson Hissong, his dark face glistening with dirt and sweat, hands on his hips as he studied her, waiting.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it your way.\u201d</p><p>Hissong nodded, as if there\u2019d never been any other possibility. He took her upper arm, guiding her forward. \u201cWatch your step,\u201d he warned. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crap on the ground.\u201d</p><p>Emma realized for the first time that she was still wearing the three inch heels she\u2019d worn to the office that morning. She hadn\u2019t had time to change before racing out of her house to get back here. She sighed and was grateful for the support of Hissong\u2019s hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Stavros,\u201d Hissong called, his deep voice carrying despite the roar of sound all around them, not only from the equipment and the rush of water, but from the fire itself.</p><p>A tall man in yellow turnout gear finished his conversation with two other firefighters before favoring Hissong with a scowl which he quickly transferred to Emma.</p><p>\u201cCaptain, this is Emma Duquet, Lord Duncan\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p><p>Stavros\u2019 eyes were weary as he looked her up and down, but that didn\u2019t mask the clear fact that he was not impressed. Whether it was with her specifically, or lawyers in general, Emma didn\u2019t know. Either way, it got her back up like nothing else would have. She might not agree with Hissong\u2019s decision on this, but having met Captain Stavros, she would fight for it with her last breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the lawyer?\u201d he said doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Is there a problem?\u201d she said coolly, deciding a head-on approach was the only kind that would work in this instance.</p><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a problem. We need to get inside this structure and your man here is stopping us. You\u2019re lucky I haven\u2019t had him arrested along with all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain Stavros, you cannot have risen to the position you have in the District without being aware of the law regarding foreign embassies, which is that the embassy itself is, for all intents and purposes, the sovereign territory of the respective nation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m aware of that,\u201d he said testily. \u201cBut I\u2019m not required to stand by and watch the damn building burn to the ground, putting other people and properties at risk. All I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is far more at risk here than property. This is the vampire embassy. There are a large number of vampires inside that house, and I\u2019m certain every one of them is pissed as hell right now. You want your men to deal with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no, but that\u2019s a risk we take, just like every other risk on this job. Besides,\u201d he added, lowering his voice. \u201cI thought vampires slept during the day.\u201d</p><p>Emma gave him a small smile and lied through her teeth. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching the wrong movies, Captain. Look,\u201d she continued in a conciliatory voice, \u201cit rained last night, everything is wet, including the surrounding properties. On top of that, Mister Hissong\u2019s men activated the automated sprinkler system and with the distance between houses, the chances of the fire spreading have got to be slim.\u201d[__]</p><p>\u201cSo, maybe I should instruct my[__] men to pull out and let the damn house burn,\u201d Stavros replied, clearly not feeling in a conciliatory mood.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is certainly your prerogative. I understand we already have private contractors en route to continue fighting the blaze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a\u2014\u201d Stavros glared at her. Anyone who worked or lived in the District, especially in an official capacity, knew the minefields associated with the various embassies and their personnel. And regardless of her jab at the fire captain earlier, she knew he had to have successfully negotiated more than one such encounter in the past in order to rise as high in the department as he had.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWe\u2019ll do what we can from out here, but the liability is yours, lady. And you keep those damn amateurs of yours away from my fire.\u201d He stormed off without waiting for her reply, and Emma blew out a long, relieved breath.</p><p>\u201cNicely done, Emma,\u201d Hissong said in her ear. \u201cI knew you had it in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d she said succinctly. \u201cYou know nothing about me. What time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes until sunset. Let\u2019s get you out of the spotlight, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Emma agreed, suddenly feeling shaky. Her confrontation with Stavros had let her forget exactly what was at stake here. But now all she could think about was Duncan and whether he was still alive, or, even worse, whether he would wake at sunset to find himself and his vampires trapped in a prison of fire.</p><p>She let Hissong take her arm again, aware of Marlon on her other side as they hurried her around to the back of the residence. It was quieter back here, with the main part of the fire seeming to be concentrated on the front of the building. But there were firefighters here, too, and Emma could see the ominous orange glow of flames dancing in the many windows. The whole house would go up before long.</p><p>Emma coughed as the fire surged from an upstairs window, blowing smoke and greasy soot right into her face. Hissong moved to shelter her from the worst of it.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, \u201cthe garages are clear. We can get you away from all of this.\u201d He pulled a set of keys out of his pocket and handed them to Marlon who hurried ahead.</p><p>\u201cHave they shared any information with you about how this got started?\u201d she asked as they detoured around the soaking wet piles of construction material.</p><p>\u201cThe fire department? No, it\u2019s too soon for their investigation. But I don\u2019t need them, I know what happened.\u201d</p><p>Emma dug in her heels, forcing him to stop. \u201cYou do? How?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis entire estate, including the residence inside and out, is on video surveillance during the day.

She didn\u2019t know what would happen when the sun set, but if it was bad, if the worst happened, she didn\u2019t want her grief spotlighted for everyone to see. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call any attention to us or to what we\u2019re waiting for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Hissong said.</p><p>They stopped a few feet inside the door, leaving it open. Emma could smell the fire, a scorched, acrid scent that stung her sinuses and made her eyes water. She knew her face must be coated with black, that her hair must be greasy and gray with ash. No wonder Stavros had doubted her credentials. She probably would have too.</p><p>With a rumble of sound, the ground shook beneath her feet. Emma froze, staring at the burning house. All around her conversation ceased. Despite the steady roar of the equipment, the absence of voices was as palpable as if the night had been perfectly still. And then the house itself shivered.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Emma whispered, more to herself than anyone else, but Jackson Hissong was at her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou ever see a really powerful vampire get angry, Emma?\u201d She shook her head silently. \u201cWell, you\u2019re about to,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming down!\u201d someone shouted. And then everyone was yelling again, rushing to pull back personnel and equipment for fear the house was about to collapse.</p><p>Emma watched it all with growing distance, feeling like a spectator at a play, as if this was all unreal. There was a mounting pressure on her brain, a presence that she couldn\u2019t quite touch, as if she only needed to open a door and there would be . . . Duncan?</p><p>The sun hovered over the horizon, moments from dropping below the edge. Duncan raged, trapped in his mind as his power stirred, coiling with him, straining to get out, building like an explosion that would take down the house and everyone around it. The very air trembled, the ground shaking, the ancient timbers of the house creaking ominously. He fought for the control that had always come so naturally for him. But this fury was far greater than any he\u2019d ever felt, his power aching to break free and avenge the wrong done to him and his people, to . . . Emma.</p><p>The thought of her banked the hunger of his power. It withdrew, curling deep inside, waiting. He had to remain calm. He needed information. Where was Emma? Had she been here when the fire hit? Was she lying injured, dying, while the humans fought the blaze, not knowing she was inside? He let his mind roam free, his thoughts searching outward. His vampires slept all around him, some already beginning to gain awareness, others too young to wake while the sun still hung in the sky.</p><p>He searched farther, beyond the confines of the dreary basement beneath the east wing, where he and his vampires had slept since moving into this unsuitable, old house. He found nothing but fire. Its heat surrounded them, greedy flames eating up the timbers like a ravening beast, drawing ever closer, threatening the primitive sleeping quarters Alaric had thrown together as a temporary measure. There were humans all around. Duncan could feel their presence too, far too many for just his daytime security. Their emotions\u2014fear, excitement, curiosity\u2014bombarded him, making it difficult to weed out any one person, to determine how bad it was. A strong mind flashed through his awareness and he grabbed onto it. This one was energized, rather than excited, and determined. A man of some authority, although it was impossible to say whether he was one of the firefighters or a policeman, or maybe even a powerful neighbor watching from the street. Whichever it was, Duncan slipped his own consciousness into the human\u2019s brain, weaving the two seamlessly until he could look up and see\u2014</p><p>His heart nearly stopped when he saw the damage to the house, the fire still raging around what must have been the focal point of an explosion\u2014his bedroom, the bedroom where Emma slept. His power roared back and it had only one goal.</p><p>\u201cEmma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d Emma whispered. She whipped her head in the direction of the house.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Hissong asked intently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought I heard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan\u2019s voice . . . in my head. He called my name. It doesn\u2019t make any sense, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense. Where did the voice seem to come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet!\u201d she snapped, and then more quietly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Let me concentrate.\u201d Emma felt foolish. Duncan had told her he couldn\u2019t read her thoughts, but he\u2019d also said that the more they exchanged blood, the closer their minds would come. And Emma liked to bite. She\u2019d taken a little of his blood every time they made love. Was it possible?</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d she whispered in her mind, and then she shouted, \u201cDUNCAN!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline,\u201d his voice came back to her, warm with feeling and as strong as if he were standing next to her. But then it faded, and Emma doubted for a moment that she\u2019d heard anything at all. Until she felt a surge of emotion that tasted like Duncan. It surrounded her\u2014calm and strong, just like he was. Emma closed her eyes against a wave of relief, leaning against the open door for support.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Hissong demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive. They\u2019re all alive, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d Hissong swore. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d He looked up, eyes narrowing as he stared in the direction of the house. Emma stepped far enough out of the doorway to see what had drawn his attention, her heart leaping at the possibility. But it was only a group of unfamiliar men storming across the backyard and heading directly for the three of them in the shelter of the garage.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d the first man called. \u201cHissong, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Jackson said, stepping out into the yard. \u201cAlaric?\u201d he said, clearly recognizing the man.</p><p>Emma blinked as the vampire contractor she\u2019d seen around the house strode closer. They\u2019d never been introduced, but she\u2019d heard Duncan on the phone with him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Duncan?\u201d Alaric demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my question for you,\u201d Jackson replied. \u201cThey\u2019re alive in there somewhere, but I don\u2019t know where\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasement of the east wing, but nothing\u2019s finished, and I got a good look at that blaze on the way here. The main section\u2019s fully engulfed, and the whole place is gonna burn.\u201d He swore viciously and stared into the distance, thinking. \u201cAll right. Best we can do is try to make it easier for Duncan. Come on, lads,\u201d he called and started across the backyard. \u201cYou, too, Hissong, and anyone else you can spare. We\u2019ve got some digging to do.\u201d</p><p>The sun finally surrendered, dropping below the horizon and freeing Duncan to act. He opened his eyes and immediately woke his vampires with a blast of power, pulling even the youngest of them out of sleep and into complete wakefulness. The fire was all around them, the main part of the house completely impassable, but even the east wing above their heads was burning now, the ancient timbers growing hotter by the minute. With a loud crack, a piece of the ceiling gave way and a tongue of flame dipped hungrily into the basement. Duncan swore as one of his vampires cried out.</p><p>\u201cEveryone to me,\u201d he shouted, putting enough power into the words to make it a command. The room was abruptly hotter, as if that small break in the ceiling brought the full heat of the blaze along with it. He was drenched in sweat, his hair, his clothes, and as he looked around, he could see all of his vampires were in the same condition. They gathered around him, their emotions a battering ram of fear and tension pounding at the wall of his control. They were looking to him to save them, to come up with a plan to get them out of here in one piece.</p><p>\u201cMiguel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Miguel said, appearing at his side.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire? It\u2019s not finished yet. There\u2019s nothing there but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Miguel. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my\u2014\u201d The rest of Miguel\u2019s words were buried under the crash of burning timbers as the entire floor above them gave way.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d His power thundered forth, holding the collapsing floor at bay while his vampires ran for the tunnel. He glanced after them long enough to be certain everyone was safe, his power casting the bronze glow of his eyes into the shadows to rival the flames themselves.</p><p>Once the last of his people was safely past, he released the burning timbers, using his vampire speed to escape as the first floor crashed into the basement. Following his vampires, Duncan sped for the minimal safety of Alaric\u2019s unfinished vault. It was a new construction, concealed beneath the backyard and reached via a tunnel from the residence. If completed, there would have been a reinforced door connected to the basement of the east wing, and another equally secure door to the vault itself. It would have been expansive, with enough room for every vampire to have his or her own small chamber.</p><p>But that had all been for the future. Alaric had finished the tunnel and the concrete enclosure for the vault, but it was still just a big box in the ground. And with the east wing burning and the electricity off, it was a big box with no exit and no air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Duncan led his people toward the tunnel entrance, their way lit by the blaze itself. He dodged aside as another section of floor gave way, the fire licking toward them eagerly, the smoke choking and black. He stopped beneath the break, using a second push of power to blow the flames back as his vampires hustled forward. Miguel led them, but Louis stood with Duncan and willingly offered his power to augment that of his Sire. Duncan rested a hand on the shorter vampire\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIn good time, Louis. This isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p><p>Louis nodded, his eyes on the vamps filing by, until everyone was past and he and Duncan took up the rear. Up ahead, the first of his vampires reached the reinforced hole in the wall where the tunnel entrance would have been. It already bore the heavy framework of support for the planned vault-style door. The relief of his vampires was a fresh breeze in his mind as they crossed into the relative safety of the tunnel.</p> <p>It was dark inside, and cold. They were ten feet underground and Duncan could feel the damp earth in his bones as surely as if it were pressing into his pores instead of held back by two solid feet of concrete. Alaric had insisted on the extra thickness of the walls, reminding Duncan that Washington, D.C. was built on a swamp and that meant seeping water everywhere. But right now that extra thickness was one more barrier between his vampires and safety.</p><p>Emma watched blankly as Alaric and his vampires began digging. She didn\u2019t know exactly why they were digging, except that Alaric had told her it would help Duncan and his vamps get out of the burning house. She\u2019d frowned at his explanation, but was willing to do whatever it took to save Duncan, so she\u2019d offered to help dig. Alaric had laughed and assured her his people could do it far faster. Casting about for something to do besides stare helplessly, she\u2019d found a supply of bottled water in the garage and hauled it out to the yard. Everyone seemed to appreciate that, even the vampires, but there was only so much water one could drink. So, now she was back to watching and waiting.</p><p>Fire Captain Stavros came around eventually, stared at the diggers, then marched over to Emma.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are those men doing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Emma drew herself up and said confidently, \u201cThey\u2019re digging a rescue tunnel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA rescue\u2014\u201d Stavros glared at her, then as if a light had gone on over his head, his expression cleared and he said, \u201cVampires.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d And then swore to herself privately because Stavros had figured it out before she did. Obviously, Duncan and his vampires slept somewhere in the basement, not on the second floor as she\u2019d assumed. And it was equally obvious that there had to be some sort of underground escape hatch. She didn\u2019t find this sudden epiphany very reassuring, however, since it wasn\u2019t much of an escape hatch if it counted on someone digging from up above. It was like drilling a rescue hole to trapped miners. They could be anywhere, and how did you know whether the rescue hole was going to be in the same place where the miners were?</p><p>Not knowing what else to say, she handed Stavros a bottle of water, then froze when Alaric shouted and everyone stopped digging. Emma stared from one of them to another, as they grabbed their equipment and began hurriedly pulling back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked Alaric when he strode over to the garage and began urging her inside the structure. He didn\u2019t answer, just stepped in front of her, blocking her body as a shock wave of air roared across the yard and the earth exploded.</p><p>Duncan forced himself to wait until all of his people were gathered in what would have been the vault. He could hear digging from above, probably Alaric\u2019s people. They\u2019d been staying very nearby, and the old vampire would know Duncan\u2019s most likely escape route. Duncan was also aware of Emma, and knew she was very close. The thought of Emma, of what could have happened if she\u2019d been asleep upstairs, finally cracked his patience.</p><p>\u201cStand back.\u201d He sent the warning to all of the vampires up above, but his own people heard it and knew what it meant. They straightened eagerly, as anxious as he was to escape their erstwhile prison. The digging stopped, and Duncan gathered his power into a single, concentrated blow, as if his fist were made of iron and the wall nothing but sand. He shot his arm forward, the gesture no more than a physical manifestation of the powerful force which slammed into the concrete wall, cracked it like an egg and exploded outward through nearly ten feet of solid earth.</p> <p>There were cheers all around, from the people outside, both human and vampire, and from his own vampires as fresh night air flooded the tunnel. A hand reached down through the muddy hole and Duncan grabbed it. He heard Alaric\u2019s roar of greeting before he\u2019d gone two steps and looked up to see the wiry vampire bearing down on him with a grin.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d Alaric shouted. \u201cAbout damn time, my lord!\u201d</p><p>They embraced, slapping backs.</p><p>\u201cYour woman\u2019s a tough little lady,\u201d Alaric growled against his ear. \u201cHandled them human honchos like she was a four star general and them buck privates,\u201d he added, chuckling.</p><p>Duncan looked over Alaric\u2019s shoulder, his gaze finding Emma in the deep shadows beneath a drooping tree on the other side of the yard. She stood motionless, staring at him, her hands clasped against her mouth. He slapped Alaric\u2019s shoulder and stepped aside, starting toward her. She watched him come, her violet eyes dark, a suspicious sheen telling him she\u2019d been crying. Her heartbeat raced faster with every step he took. When he drew close enough, her hands fell away from her face and she ran forward, his name on her lips as she threw herself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d she cried, then sucked back a sobbing breath.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline,\u201d he whispered against her ear, burying his face in the warm silk of her hair, filling his arms with her softness, and drowning himself in the scent and touch of her.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid\u2014\u201d she started, but he shushed her, covering her mouth with his lips and drinking her in, feeling her arms tighten against his neck as the kiss deepened, as their tongues met, twisting around each other hungrily. Duncan broke off the kiss reluctantly, aware of his vampires and everyone else watching them.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Emmaline,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how much as soon as I find us some privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Emma breathed, her cheeks flushing and eyes growing wide, as if aware of the onlookers for the first time.</p><p>Duncan laughed gently. \u201cIt was just a kiss,\u201d he murmured, touching his mouth to hers quickly.</p><p>\u201cNot just a kiss,\u201d Emma corrected him. \u201cOne hell of a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed loudly, tugging her against his chest for a hard hug, before taking her hand and turning to face the others. \u201cJackson,\u201d he said, searching the faces.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Jackson Hissong stepped out from where he was conferring with Miguel and Louis.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know?\u201d</p><p>Jackson came closer and said quietly, \u201cWe\u2019ve a man in custody, my lord. But perhaps we should take this conversation to the other house. Some of what needs to be said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Duncan said immediately. \u201cAnd we could all use a shower and some nutrition, as well. What about the daytime guards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your permission, my lord, I\u2019ll have them remain on duty to secure the site until your vampires can relieve them.\u201d</p><p>Duncan exchanged a look with Miguel who said, \u201cThe traitor has been secured. Jackson does not believe the rest of his men were involved, although we\u2019ll check each of them before they leave to be sure.\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded. \u201cVery well. Emma and I will go ahead to the other house, and we\u2019ll convene there once everyone\u2019s had a chance to clean up. I\u2019ll want the prisoner made available to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord,\u201d Miguel said, then turned away to begin organizing the guard rotation and departure.</p><p>Duncan dropped an arm over Emma\u2019s shoulder and began walking toward the ten foot wall which shielded the property from a path along the river. Emma sucked in a surprised breath when he opened a small control box and entered a code on the keypad concealed there. With a soft whir of noise, a hidden gate popped out of the smooth wall.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cA moonlight stroll along the river,\u201d Duncan teased.</p><p>\u201cVery romantic,\u201d she murmured, leaning against his side. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather have a hot shower.\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed. \u201cWill you share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you tell me where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs Jackson said, to the other house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was another house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire lord, Emma. There\u2019s always another house.\u201d</p><p>Emma let her head fall back as the blessedly hot water streamed through her hair, washing away shampoo along with hours of sweat and soot. She straightened and finger-combed some conditioner in, then reached back and pulled the bulk of her wet hair over one shoulder, letting the water pound the stress from her back. Sighing with pleasure, she grabbed a bar of soap and rubbed it between her hands, generating a thick lather that had only a faint clean scent. No flowery soaps for Duncan, apparently, which was fine with her. She lifted her soapy hands to her face and began to wash gently, trying not to think about what the bar soap was doing to her skin. One night wouldn\u2019t kill her, and besides the oily residue of black soot left behind by the smoke and fire probably needed something stronger than her usual facial cleanser. She\u2019d moisturize extra tomorrow to make up for it, once she could get to her own things. That thought made her pause. The things she\u2019d left at Duncan\u2019s were gone, although, thank God, she\u2019d had her laptop with her. Everything else was easily replaceable. Besides, Duncan had survived and that\u2019s all that mattered.</p><p>And speak of the devil . . . She caught a blurred shadow of movement before the shower door opened and the vampire himself stepped inside. Emma ran an admiring eye up and down his naked body. The mud and dirt which had made her look like a refugee only made him look more masculine, more dangerous. He bumped her carefully with his hip, one arm snaking out to circle her waist as he pushed her out of the flow of hot water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWater hog,\u201d she complained halfheartedly.</p><p>\u201cSays the woman who\u2019s all shiny clean,\u201d he commented, then backed up a step, pulling her under the spray with him. Emma sputtered briefly before burying her face against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting me dirty,\u201d she muttered, but she wrapped her arms around his narrow waist, running her hands over the firm muscles of his back. He was like a work of art, every muscle perfectly defined and flowing elegantly over tendons and bones.</p> <p>Duncan tipped his head back into the spray as she\u2019d done earlier, letting the water run through his long, blond hair. She reached behind him and grabbed the shampoo. He was too tall for her to wash his hair comfortably, so she settled for squirting a fair amount of the gel on his wet hair, then standing back to admire the play of muscles in his arms and shoulders as he scrubbed the mud away.</p><p>\u201cGod, this feels good,\u201d he said, rinsing his hair clean.</p><p>\u201cBeing clean?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He opened his eyes and gave her a slow smile. \u201cBeing naked with you.\u201d His hands came down to grip her hips, and he backed her against the tile wall. \u201cHaving my hands on you.\u201d His hands dropped to her butt and he lifted her effortlessly, pressing forward until her legs wrapped around his narrow hips. She could feel his erection, hard and heavy against her thigh, as he rubbed against her gently, teasing her.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d she whispered, pleading. But he wasn\u2019t ready to give in to her pleas. Not yet. One hand came up between them to cover her breast, his thumb playing over her nipple until it was full and hard. He bent his head to nip lightly at the plump flesh.</p> <p>\u201cI worried about you, Emmaline,\u201d he murmured, lapping at the same nipple he\u2019d just bitten, and then biting harder until she cried out, her legs tightening around his hips as her sex clenched in need.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she gasped, grabbing a handful of his wet hair and tugging. \u201cFor you, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Duncan looked up and grinned, his hips never ceasing their maddening thrusting motion, letting her feel the length of his cock, so close, but not where she wanted it, not where she needed it.</p><p>\u201cDuncan, so help me, if you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cried out as, without warning, he plunged his full length deep between her legs, stretching her wide despite her readiness, slamming forward until their hips met with a slap of wet flesh. He waited then, watching her as she struggled to catch her breath, as her body softened to accommodate him.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t what?\u201d he asked silkily.</p> <p>Emma pulled his head forward, tugging him into a breathless kiss. It was warm and wet and soft, a slow caress of lips and tongue while below, her inner muscles flexed around his shaft with the same rhythm. Duncan hissed as his cock jerked in response, and Emma lifted her head slowly, licking her tongue along the curve of his mouth before whispering, \u201cI love you, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Duncan met her gaze, his expression completely serious as he began a slow, steady movement, the tight muscles of his ass clenching as his hips thrust forward and back between her legs, his erection a shaft of warm stone sheathed in satin as he repeatedly withdrew until only the very tip remained inside her, then slid deep into her body once more, a long, smooth glide of flesh into flesh. Emma crossed her ankles over his butt, trapping him between her thighs. Her arms were around his neck, her fingers threaded through his hair. Duncan\u2019s mouth moved over her face, kissing her eyes, her jaw and down to her neck. His tongue was cool against her overheated flesh as he licked the sweat and water from her skin, as he sucked hard over her jugular vein. Emma smiled to herself, thinking she\u2019d have a hickey in the morning. She hadn\u2019t had one of those in\u2014</p><p>She groaned with arousal as his fangs pierced her vein, as the first powerful orgasm rocketed through her body, clenching her womb and tightening her breasts. Every stroke of Duncan\u2019s rigid length produced a fresh jolt of incredible sensation, wave after wave of pleasure, as if her nerves were bare and his cock a brush of silk against them. Emma began thrusting in time with his movements, wanting him to join her, wanting to feel that moment when he lost control and tumbled over the edge with her.</p><p>His fangs still buried in her neck, Duncan groaned. The sound vibrated against her skin and raced through her veins, rumbling over her breasts and down between her legs to shiver along the length of his cock. He lifted his head, and his tongue lapped quickly at the small puncture wounds before he crushed his mouth over hers, sharing the taste of her blood. Emma met his kiss hungrily, biting as she fought to get closer to him, licking his lips in apology when she felt the warm flow of his blood, but relishing the rush of heat that came with it.</p><p>Duncan growled and began fucking her, pounding her against the wet tile, protecting her with his arms around her back as he slammed forward harder and harder, until Emma thought the tiles would surely crack under the strain. Snarling hungrily, he lifted her higher, changing the angle of his penetration, going even deeper than before, his thickness tormenting the sensitive flesh of her inner walls until her body was trembling with arousal and begging for release. Duncan slid the fingers of one hand along the crease of her ass, caressing the strip of skin stretched taut with his penetration, before dipping his finger into the tight pucker of her star. Emma gasped as a second orgasm screamed along her nerves, jumping like lightening from the touch of his hand to the thrust of his cock and up to her swollen breasts, which were crushed against his powerful chest. She bit down on his shoulder, trying to swallow the scream that surged up her throat, overwhelmed by the sensations storming every inch of her body. Her sex clamped down on Duncan\u2019s cock as he began to buck against her, his hot release coating her womb as her teeth broke the skin of his shoulder, and he lifted his head to howl his climax.</p><p>Duncan leaned heavily against Emma, holding her up as much with the press of his body as the grip of his hands on her sweet ass. She\u2019d wrung him dry. Or maybe it was the hot shower that was still drumming against his back, matching the heat of Emma against his chest. Her arms were loose over his shoulders, her ankles still locked around his hips, while her eager little tongue continued to lap the blood from his shoulder. He rested a hand gently against the back of her head, encouraging her. The more of his blood she took, the tighter the bond would be between them. His shoulder pulsed as he remembered the feel of her teeth in his flesh, and he grinned. She was a wildcat, his Emma. And she was his.</p><p>As unlikely as it seemed, he\u2019d fallen in love again. He\u2019d loved his wife dearly, though the memory was so old and distant, it was as if it had happened to someone else. But he could still recall the scent of her powder, the touch of her hand as she rubbed his shoulders after a hard day. She\u2019d been a good woman who deserved better than he\u2019d been able to give her. And far better than the end he\u2019d brought her to.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t that man anymore. No one, man or vampire, would touch his woman ever again. Emma was his, and he would fight to the death to protect her. Of course, Emma would probably bite him again if she knew his thoughts. She wasn\u2019t a shy flower to stand behind and let someone else fight her battles. No, she\u2019d want to stand at his side and fight their enemies together. And that was better. Because the world was a terrible and treacherous place, and it comforted him to know Emma would be there to face it with him when he woke every night.</p> <p>Emma gave his shoulder a final lick and lifted her head. \u201cWhat are you thinking so hard about?\u201d she murmured, kissing the bite she\u2019d been suckling so eagerly.</p><p>\u201cOnly that I love you, Emmaline.\u201d He rubbed his chin against her wet hair. \u201cWill you stay?\u201d</p><p>She grew still. \u201cStay?\u201d she asked, her breath warm on his torn flesh. \u201cYou mean tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean forever.\u201d</p><p>Emma lifted her head to look at him, her eyes filling with tears. \u201cDuncan?\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze evenly. \u201cStay with me, Emma,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBe mine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded wordlessly, tears running down her cheeks. \u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, then blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t very poetic of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoetry is overrated,\u201d Duncan commented. He stepped back and lowered her slowly, letting her slide down his body until her feet were firmly on the floor.</p><p>Emma sighed, resting her forehead against his chest. The two of them stood there, listening to each other breathe, until Emma said, laughing, \u201cI think I need a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d he tugged her under the water which was still running, although noticeably cooler than it had been. \u201cI was trying to shower when you molested me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? You started it,\u201d she murmured absently, running her hands over his abdomen, which clenched automatically beneath her fingers. She looked up at him and winked.</p><p>Duncan groaned. \u201cLet me at least finish washing up. If I\u2019d have known you were this insatiable, I\u2019d have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucked you into unconsciousness before I showered,\u201d he whispered against her ear.</p><p>\u201cDuncan!\u201d she gasped, but she didn\u2019t pull away.</p><p>It was a quick shower, but only because Emma declined his offer to wash away the remnants of their lovemaking between her legs. \u201cWe\u2019ll never get out of here, if you do that,\u201d she said, slapping away his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll be a prune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA most attractive prune, however,\u201d he said gallantly. But he stepped out of the shower and began to dry off while Emma finished. He had pulled on a pair of sweats and was waiting with a big towel when she emerged a few moments later. Wrapping it around her, he scooped her off her feet and carried her into the bedroom. She lifted her arms to circle his neck, then sighed wearily and rested her head against his shoulder.</p><p>Duncan had already pulled the covers back and now laid her down on the fresh sheets. Placing one knee on the mattress next to her, he finished drying her naked body, then pulled the covers up and leaned in to kiss her tenderly. \u201cSleep, Emma. I\u2019ll be near.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his hand when he went to stand, her eyes already half closed in sleep. \u201cWhere will you sleep today, Duncan?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWith you, Emmaline. This house is better suited to my kind. I\u2019ll come back here to you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, rubbing her cheek against his hand before releasing it and curling up under the blanket. She was out in moments, without any help from Duncan, although he\u2019d been prepared to nudge her into sleep if necessary. He had a prisoner to interrogate. The man who\u2019d set fire to the residence, and who\u2019d clearly intended to kill Duncan along with a few of his vampires, and perhaps Emma, as well. It was not a task Duncan looked forward to, but it was something he would do and do quite well, because nothing was more important to him than the safety of Emma and his people. But somehow he doubted his beloved Emma would admire his skill when the human began screaming for mercy.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p> <p>Duncan crossed his arms over his chest and leaned back against the wall of the small, barren basement room. He\u2019d pulled a t-shirt on over his sweats and added a pair of black Nikes, but he hadn\u2019t bothered with anything fancier, because he\u2019d fully expected to be burning the clothes before the end of the night. He\u2019d also expected to be facing a quivering lump of terrified humanity, begging for its life. Instead what he had was a puzzle.</p><p>He frowned down at the human guard sitting across the table from him. The man\u2019s arms were handcuffed behind his back, but other than that he wasn\u2019t restrained. And he wasn\u2019t particularly frightened, either.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d the man asked, his wide eyes guileless and confused. \u201cHas something happened?\u201d</p><p>This man had dragged a welder\u2019s propane tank from Alaric\u2019s construction site in the east wing, rigged it to blow like a small bomb right beneath Duncan\u2019s second floor office suite, then splashed paint thinner in a line from there to the main stairwell. He\u2019d then walked calmly out of the house through the kitchen door in back and returned to his regular perimeter patrol, leaving plenty of time for his usual check-in. There was no question of guilt; they had security video both inside and out from the motion-activated digital feed Miguel had set up as soon as they moved into the house. Once the cameras were triggered, the images were sent to a control center in the house down the block from Victor\u2019s old residence. It was the house Miguel and Louis had lived in while preparing for Duncan\u2019s takeover of the territory, the same house they were now all living in until either the old residence was repaired or new quarters were found and secured.</p><p>And yet, despite this incontrovertible evidence, the guard seemed to remember none of it. He still should have been afraid, however. Even if he\u2019d done nothing wrong, he should be terrified to find himself handcuffed and facing Duncan as his inquisitor.</p> <p>\u201cMister Daniels, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Duncan asked finally, although he knew the guard\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d the man said readily. \u201cClint Daniels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, what\u2019s the last thing you remember before you were brought here?\u201d Daniels shook his head woefully. \u201cBeing handcuffed, my lord,\u201d he said, seeming confused. \u201cI was standing by the main gate entrance, keeping the spectators out during the fire, and then Jackson Hissong showed up and had one of the guys put these on me.\u201d He tried to lift his hands behind him, but they were looped over the back of the chair and he grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t understand, my lord. What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I touch you, Mister Daniels? It\u2019s not necessary, but it will make things easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s frown deepened. Clint Daniels obviously had nothing to hide, or at least nothing he knew to try to hide. A suspicion took root in Duncan\u2019s thoughts, making his gut clench with both anger and foreboding. He straightened away from the wall and circled the table, aware of Miguel stiffening to attention behind him as he drew closer to the prisoner. Duncan placed his hand on Daniels\u2019s head, automatically brushing the man\u2019s hair off his forehead in a comforting gesture as he inserted himself effortlessly into the human\u2019s consciousness. Daniels\u2019s emotions rose to Duncan\u2019s awareness first, and what he found only confirmed what he\u2019d noticed a few moments ago. Clint Daniels was worried and confused, but he wasn\u2019t frightened. And he damn well should be.</p> <p>Duncan dug deeper, seeing the house fire through Daniels\u2019s eyes, the crowds outside the gate. The crowds Duncan had avoided by taking his midnight stroll along the river with Emma. The thought of Emma, and the danger she\u2019d so narrowly avoided, renewed his purpose, and he burrowed into Daniels\u2019s thoughts without compassion. He was as careful as possible, but he needed the truth.</p><p>Duncan closed his eyes and focused. He saw the surface memories, the same ones Daniels had related to him, the bewilderment when Jackson Hissong had ordered him handcuffed, but nothing more than that. He delved deeper, forcing Daniels to remember. The human began to tremble. He groaned, his legs thrashing, kicking against the table as if trying to escape. Duncan saw the barrier then, the wall someone had erected in this man\u2019s memories, someone skillful enough to do it without leaving the human a drooling idiot. This wasn\u2019t Victor\u2019s work. He\u2019d seen the way Victor had scrambled Violet\u2019s memories, the hasty patch that left her bewildered and unable to function. No, this was the work of someone far more skillful and patient. Someone who\u2019d thought ahead, who\u2019d set it up so Daniels could set his trap and resume his duties without a hitch. If it hadn\u2019t been for Miguel\u2019s cameras\u2014something only Duncan and a very few others knew about\u2014they probably would never have known who set the blaze. That it was arson, everyone knew by now, even the human fire investigators. But they might never have traced the act back to this man.</p><p>Daniels began to weep, heartbreaking sobs that choked his voice as he apologized over and over again, the expected fear finally saturating his emotions. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, my lord. I never would have\u2014\u201d His voice broke again as the sobs took over.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Clint,\u201d Duncan said gently, smoothing a hand over Daniels\u2019s bent head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d He continued to stroke the human\u2019s head as he worked, replacing the memories with ones of his own. It was a shame. This man had been a loyal employee, a fine guard. If Duncan had gotten to him first, this never would have happened. But there hadn\u2019t been enough time; too many crises had hit all at once. Duncan had never found the time to check each and every one of the daytime guards for time bombs like this, and to add defenses to their minds against casual intrusion.</p><p>He sighed and released Daniels\u2019s mind, easing the man carefully forward until he was slumped on the table, fast asleep.</p><p>\u201cUncuff him,\u201d he told Miguel. \u201cDoes he have a family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Miguel said, unlocking the cuffs and rubbing the human\u2019s arms briskly to restore circulation. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those I brought with me from the West Coast. A good man, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Duncan agreed wearily. \u201cA good man someone tried to use against us. Someone got to him, Miguel. A master vampire we\u2019ve somehow missed.\u201d</p> <p>Miguel shot him an alarmed look. \u201cCould it be someone we\u2019ve already met? Like that artist Erik, or his partner, Brendan?\u201d</p><p>But Duncan was already shaking his head. \u201cNo. Neither of them is a master vampire. It\u2019s someone we\u2019ve overlooked,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cDamn it all! As if I don\u2019t have enough on my plate already.\u201d He looked away in disgust. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cSend our friend here back to California, give him a good job. None of this was his fault.\u201d</p><p>Miguel nodded. \u201cWhat will you do now, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Duncanhuffed a bitter laugh. \u201cWait for whoever did this to show himself. He knows that I\u2019m aware of him now, and that I\u2019ll be looking for him. Better for him to act than to wait for me to find him. He\u2019ll make his move soon enough, and we\u2019ll be ready when he does.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Duncan stripped away his clothes, feeling sullied despite the fact there\u2019d been no real violence necessary tonight. No blood, anyway. What he\u2019d been forced to do to Clint Daniels\u2019s brain was a violation, but at least the human was still functional, still able to live his life as before.</p><p>He dropped the t-shirt on the floor and crossed to the big bed where Emma slept. She breathed deeply, evenly, her heart a steady pounding that drew him like a magnet. He slipped into bed next to her and pulled her into the curve of his body, half hoping she\u2019d wake. She didn\u2019t. She simply smiled in her sleep and curled up against him, her soft lips touching his chest in a dreaming kiss.</p><p>He felt the sun lurking below the horizon. There were only minutes left until daylight stole his awareness. He tightened his arms around Emma, buried his face in her warm, silky hair and closed his eyes.</p><p>Emma woke feeling more rested than she had in weeks. At least until she opened her eyes to a dark room in a strange house. She had a bad moment then, before it all came roaring back\u2014the fire, the wait to see if Duncan and the other vampires were still alive, the shower . . . She smiled at the memory, running her hands over her body, feeling sexy and desired and very, very female. Duncan was asleep next to her, his breathing slow and steady\u2014maybe a little too slow, now that she thought about it. If she hadn\u2019t known he was a vampire, she\u2019d have been worried. Her thoughts froze and she rolled over quickly, grabbing her watch from the bedside table. It was late, little more than an hour until sunset, but still daylight for now, which explained the heavy drapes and darkened room. She turned to stare at Duncan. He wasn\u2019t just asleep. He was asleep. Well, this was a first\u2014one of those moments in a relationship that you never forget. Of course, she was the only one who\u2019d remember it, since Duncan, while not actually dead, was certainly dead to the world.</p><p>The ringing of a cell phone had her jumping from the bed to answer it before it woke Duncan. About the time her feet hit the carpet, she realized it didn\u2019t matter. The house could come down around Duncan and he wouldn\u2019t wake up. As a matter of fact, the house had nearly[__] come down around him yesterday, and he\u2019d slept right through most of it. As far as she knew, anyway. She\u2019d have to ask him about that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the damn cell phone was still ringing. Emma flipped on the bedside lamp. The light was barely enough to keep her from running into anything while she followed the ringing sound to her phone. Except it wasn\u2019t hers. It was Duncan\u2019s. She stared at the caller ID. Cynthia. Who the hell was Cynthia?</p><p>Feeling somewhat guilty, she glanced over her shoulder at her sleeping lover, then answered the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, \u201cWho the hell is this?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice demanded.</p> <p>Emma\u2019s eyes narrowed in irritation. \u201cI think that\u2019s my line, since you called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call you, I called Duncan. Where the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsleep. Which you\u2019d know if you knew anything about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I know more about Duncan than you do, including the fact that he\u2019s asleep. I expected to get his voicemail, but instead I got you. So, who are you and what the hell have you done with Duncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot.For hours and hours. Deal with it.\u201d Emma disconnected, feeling both petty and very satisfied. Of course, Duncan might not see it that way.</p> <p>She jumped as the phone immediately began ringing again. Cynthia. What a surprise. Emma considered answering if only for the satisfaction of disconnecting again, but figured the bitch would just keep calling. Assuming she was a bitch. Hell, maybe this Cynthia person was Duncan\u2019s accountant or something. Emma was beginning to second guess her rudeness when her own cell phone started ringing from somewhere on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with these phones?\u201d she grumped and went in search of her jacket. Her phone, which had survived all of last night\u2019s trauma with nothing but a bit of mud to show for it, should still be in the jacket\u2019s pocket. She had a wild thought that it might be Cynthia calling her, too, but that was only the pricking of her guilty conscience. Not that Emma doubted a determined someone could find her cell number, but not that quickly. Not without even a name to go by. She finally located her clothes and dug out the phone, frowning at what she saw there. The call was coming from her office. Or rather what had been her office until Sharon fired her. Was it just yesterday? It seemed too much had happened for such a short period of time.</p><p>She debated not picking up. After all, she didn\u2019t owe them anything anymore. But it might be Noreen or one of the other legislative assistants. It wasn\u2019t their fault Sharon was an ass, or that Guy Coffer couldn\u2019t stand up to his wife. She sighed and punched the receive button.</p><p>\u201cEmma Duquet,\u201d she answered cautiously.</p><p>\u201cEmma, I\u2019m so glad I reached you,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said, far too pleasantly. A politician\u2019s voice. It was Guy Coffer himself calling. This couldn\u2019t be anything good.</p><p>\u201cCongressman Coffer,\u201d she managed. \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing at all, Emma. I\u2019m actually calling to apologize for the way things were handled yesterday. I had no idea Sharon was going to let you go. Of course, I leave staff matters to her, but if I\u2019d known . . .\u201d His voice trailed off, because they both knew that even if he\u2019d known, he wouldn\u2019t have done anything.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind, sir,\u201d Emma said, taking pity on him. He wasn\u2019t a bad man. He simply lacked certain essential anatomical parts.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I feel very guilty about how things fell out. I\u2019ve written a letter of reference for you, and I\u2019ve recommended you to several of my colleagues, as well. It might be best if you pick the letter up personally, however. I wouldn\u2019t want it to get misplaced in the regular office mail.\u201d</p><p>Which meant if Sharon saw it, she\u2019d drop it in the shredder so fast she\u2019d lose a finger doing it. Emma considered the situation. She really needed that letter, and she still had her ID, since she\u2019d never bothered to drop it off when she left. She could make a quick run up to the Hill, grab the letter and be back here in no time. Coffer would never have suggested Emma come by if there was even the slightest chance Sharon would be around, so there was no risk of a confrontation on that front.</p><p>Emma glanced over her shoulder to where Duncan slept in perfect stillness, perfect vulnerability. Someone had tried to kill him yesterday, and probably her, too. He\u2019d told her last night that this house was better suited to vampires, and she knew there\u2019d be humans guarding the place during daylight, as there\u2019d been at the old house. She frowned thoughtfully. Jackson Hissong would be around somewhere, and she was sure he\u2019d make someone available to go with her up to Coffer\u2019s office and back.</p><p>But Duncan wouldn\u2019t like it. And he\u2019d be right.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that, Congressman,\u201d she told Coffer. \u201cBut I\u2019m not at home. In fact, I\u2019m on my way back to the District right now. It\u2019ll take me a couple of hours to get there, and then into the office. I can\u2019t ask you to wait that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all, Emma. I came in today for the peace and quiet, and I\u2019ve got some work to do, so I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, thank you, sir. That\u2019s very kind. I\u2019ll get there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Emma walked down the nearly empty halls of the Capitol building. The office corridors were far away from the public areas of the building, and it was the weekend. No one but the occasional staffer could be seen hurrying down the usually crowded hallways.</p><p>Emma hadn\u2019t bothered to dress up. She didn\u2019t plan to be here long enough for it to matter. As it was, she\u2019d had to go by her house to change. Everything she\u2019d had at Duncan\u2019s old residence was gone, so she had nothing but the gray suit and silk blouse she\u2019d been wearing when Sharon fired her yesterday. That and her three inch pumps, all of which were in desperate need of cleaning. But regardless of his promise, she\u2019d been afraid Coffer wouldn\u2019t wait, so she\u2019d stopped at her house only long enough to change into a pair of faded denims and a long, cable-knit sweater, along with some flat-soled boots. The flat soles were just in case she had to make a run for it, like if Sharon happened to show up unexpectedly. Emma chuckled at the idea and pulled open the door to Guy Coffer\u2019s congressional office.</p><p>The outermost area was empty. She hadn\u2019t expected the receptionists to be here on a Saturday, but the inner offices were quiet, too. She frowned. That was more unusual, but it all depended on the Congressman\u2019s schedule of meetings and what legislation was up when. Two days ago, Emma could have rattled off that information without thinking, but the knowledge seemed to have deserted her the minute she no longer needed it.</p><p>She reached Coffer\u2019s office door and knocked quietly. \u201cCongressman Coffer?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d barely lifted her knuckles from the solid wood before the door was yanked open and the wicked witch herself stood there glaring hatefully.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Sharon Coffer sneered. \u201cI\u2019ll take your ID now.\u201d</p><p>Emma rolled her eyes. She should have known. Guy Coffer didn\u2019t take a pee without checking with Sharon first. \u201cReally, Sharon,\u201d she drawled. \u201cIf all you wanted was the ID, you could have called yourself. I\u2019d have been happy to mail it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the stupid ID. I wanted to prove to myself once and for all that I was right about you. You just couldn\u2019t pass up a chance to get my husband alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d Emma groaned. \u201cWhy would I want to share Guy with you, when I can have him all to myself?\u201d She hooked a thumb over her shoulder to where Duncan was strolling in from the outer office.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Emma darlin\u2019,\u201d he said, giving her a playful wink. \u201cBut parking is terrible here. I should really write to my congressman about it.\u201d</p><p>Sharon Coffer\u2019s eyes opened up like a cartoon character\u2019s and she hissed like a cat. \u201cThis creature is your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Emma said proudly, \u201calthough there isn\u2019t anything boyish about him\u201d She reached up to stroke a hand down Duncan\u2019s leather jacketed arm. \u201cIsn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a monster!\u201d</p><p>Emma cocked her head at the other woman, finding it interesting that Sharon had known Duncan was a vampire without being told. Emma hadn\u2019t met that many vampires, but of those she had, Duncan was the most human looking. She\u2019d never have suspected him of being a vampire\u2014in fact, she hadn\u2019t when she\u2019d first met him. And yet Sharon Coffer didn\u2019t only suspect, she knew. Emma was beginning to get a bad feeling about this. Violet hadn\u2019t identified Guy Coffer as one of Victor\u2019s perverted partners. But then she hadn\u2019t known most of the men involved by name, and Guy Coffer wasn\u2019t someone whose face was on the nightly news. Then there was the unknown woman who\u2019d been there the night Lacey died, the woman who\u2019d been yelling at everyone as if she had a right to do so. Emma felt a thrill of fear. Thank God she\u2019d waited until Duncan could come with her tonight. Speaking of which . . .</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d she said, letting her alarm show.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, Emmaline,\u201d he assured her, taking her hand and lifting it to his lips briefly. He\u2019d caught the same oddity about Sharon\u2019s reaction that she had, of course. In fact, he\u2019d probably made the connection before she did.</p><p>Duncan stepped in front of Emma, but didn\u2019t say a word to Sharon. He just stared down at the Congressman\u2019s wife, his head tilted curiously, studying her like she was some sort of peculiar bug. She stared back at him, her initially defiant stance softening as her eyes glazed over and her arms fell loosely to her sides. They remained that way for a few minutes, and then Duncan took Sharon\u2019s arm and turned her around, guiding her back into the Congressman\u2019s office. Emma followed, jerking to a stop when she saw Guy Coffer sitting there. Or maybe lying there was a better description. His head was cheek down on the desk, his eyes closed as if sleeping.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Emma whispered, not wanting to disturb Duncan\u2019s concentration.</p><p> likThere\u2019s no need to whisper,\u201d Duncan said in his usual voice. \u201cAnd, yes, the Congressman is fine. It was simply easier to deal with them one at a time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou guys could rule the world, you know,\u201d Emma commented, watching Duncan guide Sharon over to a straight-backed chair near the window.</p><p>\u201cWho says we don\u2019t?\u201d he asked absently.</p><p>Emma frowned, pretty sure he was joking. \u201cSo, what\u2019d you discover? What do they know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA great number of tedious things, I\u2019m afraid. As for the delightful Missus Coffer\u2019s knowledge of and abhorrence for my vampire nature, however, that came directly from Max Grafton at a recent dinner party. Last night, as a matter of fact. Interesting coincidence, don\u2019t you think? That as I was dying tragically in a fire that one assumes will be blamed on some hate group or other, Max Grafton was already poisoning the well to explain my unfortunate demise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Emma asked, pointing at the apparently sleeping Guy Coffer. \u201cWhat does he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a pathetic excuse for a man.\u201d Duncan glanced over his shoulder at her. \u201cPlease tell me you never entertained any romantic notions about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d Emma said, wrinkling her nose. \u201cA politician?\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed. \u201cI suspect Sharon here would have the same reaction to dating a vampire.\u201d</p> <p>Emma huffed a dismissive breath. \u201cShows what she knows. Ask any woman, hell, probably any man, too, on Facebook if they\u2019d rather have a vampire or a politician as a lover. Vampires would win hands down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201dDuncan said, looking far too interested.</p><p>\u201cNot your concern, beautiful. You\u2019re off the menu. Speaking of which, what\u2019s with all these women calling to check on you . . .\u201d Emma stopped talking, abruptly aware that Duncan might not have listened to Cynthia\u2019s voice mail yet.</p><p>Duncan grinned as he crossed the office back toward Emma, his walk a slow, lethal stroll of grace and power. Emma\u2019s heart kicked hard against her ribs, and she felt her mouth begin to water.</p><p>\u201cJealous, Emmaline?\u201dDuncan whispered against her ear. His arm snaked around her waist, snugging her tight against his body, and she nearly groaned aloud as she felt the firm bulge of his arousal.</p><p>\u201cInsanely, viciously, unreasonably jealous,\u201d she hissed back. \u201cAnd I know how to use a gun.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed again, then kissed her hard and fast, and pulled away. \u201cCynthia\u2014and yes, I did listen to the message and she\u2019s very eager to meet you\u2014is a friend. She\u2019s also mated to my Sire, Raphael, who is Lord of the Western Territories. In point of fact, you and Cynthia are not unalike. God save us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, then spun her around, slapping her ass to get her moving out of the office. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before the unfortunate Coffers awake from their naps. I have a killer to beard tonight, Emmaline, and we need to prepare.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Emma fumed, as she stormed across the bedroom and dropped a small gym bag near the desk. \u201cYou are not leaving me here, while you guys go out and have all the fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not fun, Emma,\u201d Duncan said with that infuriating calm of his. \u201cMax Grafton has already killed once that we know of. I\u2019m sure I needn\u2019t remind you that he very nearly killed again when he arranged for my residence to burn. Not to mention\u2014\u201d</p><p>Emma opened her mouth to argue, but Duncan forestalled her with a look, and continued, \u201c\u2014that there\u2019s a vampire involved. A vampire shrewd enough to manipulate one of my own guards and escape detection while doing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I do know, Emma,\u201d he said implacably. \u201cI know vampires. I know what they\u2019re capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t be only vampires out there tonight,\u201d she argued. Louis had tracked Max Grafton to his residence in nearby Virginia through a skillful, and quite illegal, tap on the senator\u2019s personal phones. Grafton was hosting a dinner party at the Virginia house tonight. Unlike the earlier fundraiser, or the event last night where he\u2019d spoken with Sharon Coffer, tonight was to be a very private affair for a few friends. \u201cEven if there\u2019s a vampire involved\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d Duncan stated.</p><p>She ignored the interruption. \u201c\u2014there\u2019s no reason to believe he\u2019ll be there tonight. Louis hasn\u2019t heard anything that indicates this is business. It\u2019s just some friends, so there there\u2019s no reason\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him warily. Emma might be all wild emotion, but Duncan didn\u2019t get angry, or rather, he didn\u2019t show it. He just got quieter and colder, his words more precise. And that one word, her name, had been cut with a very sharp knife.</p><p>\u201cBy now,\u201d Duncan explained slowly, as if she was too stupid to understand, or maybe because it was the third time he\u2019d told her this same thing, \u201cSharon Coffer has called Max Grafton to gossip about seeing me in her husband\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d Emma started, but she stopped when Duncan gave her a flat look. She rolled her eyes and waited.</p><p>\u201cI do know. I had Louis check the taps on Grafton\u2019s phone, because I also knew you wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>Emma made a face at him, irritated that he\u2019d been right. Again. It must be tough on him, being right all the time.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s mouth quirked up in a half smile as he continued. \u201cMax Grafton, in turn, has contacted his vampire ally because he knows I\u2019ll be coming for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know who the other vampire is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not. Grafton\u2019s call was to a dead drop voice mail, and we haven\u2019t been able to track down the owner. My people have lived in the shadows for thousands of years, and we\u2019ve gotten very good at protecting ourselves. Many of the old ones prefer the shadows even now. The point is, Emma, that the true confrontation tonight will be between me and that other vampire. No other battle will matter. And I don\u2019t want you anywhere near when that happens. If I lose that fight, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s heart was suddenly in her throat. It had never occurred to her that Duncan could lose. He was beautiful, strong, invincible. He was . . . Duncan. \u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happens if you lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I lose, and I don\u2019t intend to, but if I do, I need to know that you\u2019re safe. And that means far away from me.\u201d</p><p>Emma stared at him. She hadn\u2019t really considered what it meant that another vampire was involved, someone who was possibly just as powerful as Duncan. Someone so set on getting rid of Duncan, someone so vicious that they\u2019d set fire to the residence, knowing that Duncan and his vampires would be burned alive. But rather than deterring her, that knowledge made her more determined than ever to be there tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cYou can leave me here, but unless you lock me up, I\u2019ll get there by myself anyway.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI could put you to sleep,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019d never know.\u201d</p><p>Emma met his gaze evenly. \u201cI\u2019d know,\u201d she assured him. \u201cAnd I\u2019d never forgive you.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in Duncan\u2019s jaw flexed visibly as he stared back at her. It was the only sign of whatever emotion he was feeling. \u201cFine,\u201d he said at last. \u201cBut you hang back, Emma. I go in first. And if anything happens to me, you run.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded once in agreement, although there was no way in hell she was going to run away if Duncan needed her. She kept that thought from her mind, though, filling it instead with the lyrics of a particularly irritating song she\u2019d heard on the radio today.</p><p>\u201cSo, when are we leaving?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Duncan regarded her carefully, and Emma would have sworn she saw a flash of frustration in his brown eyes. So maybe the song lyrics were working to block him from hearing what she was thinking. She filed that information away for the future and gazed at him innocently. He snorted dismissively and said, \u201cBe downstairs in ten minutes. I have to check some things with Miguel and Louis.\u201d</p><p>He started to turn, but Emma said, \u201cHey!\u201d Duncan raised an eyebrow in question. \u201cHow about a kiss for luck.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grinned and wrapped one big hand around the back of her neck, pulling her in for a deep, satisfying, toe-curling kiss. He lifted his head at last, gliding his tongue along the seam of her lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Emmaline Duquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Duncan. So you be careful.\u201d</p><p>He touched his mouth to hers one more time, and then he was gone. Emma listened, but she didn\u2019t even hear his footsteps on the stairs. She shrugged and hurried over to the duffle bag, which was the only other thing she\u2019d picked up at her house earlier. It held her gun and ammo, and she had a feeling she was going to need them tonight.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Max Grafton\u2019s house wasn\u2019t so much a house as an estate. Emma had known he had money. Most senators did by the time they\u2019d been around as long as Grafton had. But in his case, the money was in his family. Old money. Old Southern money. As someone who grew up in old Southern poverty, Emma knew exactly what a difference that kind of money meant. Still, she hadn\u2019t been prepared for the vastness of his estate. There was the house itself, which was huge, along with a second two-story building that she guessed was where the household staff lived, because with a house as big as his, he\u2019d definitely need live-in help. There was a pool, and a pool house big enough to house a family. And then there were the stables. Emma didn\u2019t know much about horses, but if even half of the stalls she could see in the long horse barn contained animals, it had to be costing Grafton a small fortune to feed and maintain them.</p><p>The whole estate was too big to put a wall around, but there was a white rail fence along the road, and Grafton had walled off the main buildings and barns. A short gravel drive took them to a big iron gate with a stylized \u201cG\u201d worked into it. Two guards wearing black combat gear stood there, each cradling a matte black semiautomatic with obvious familiarity. Emma worried as their two matching SUVs rode up to the gate, wondering how they\u2019d talk their way in, but she shouldn\u2019t have. After all, she\u2019d seen Duncan zap Sharon Coffer with a look. Ari, who was driving Duncan\u2019s SUV, convinced the gate guard they were invited guests in less time than it probably would have taken to show their IDs if they really had been invited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They drove past the open gate and a short distance up the drive, waiting while the second SUV cleared security. Once they were together again, the two SUVs started down the long twisting road to the house. A double row of trees, manicured to identical perfection, lined the drive, white lights twinkling in their boughs. It would have been pretty on any other night.</p><p>\u201cRemember, gentlemen,\u201d Duncan said coolly as they approached the house. \u201cWe go in quietly. There will be\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly, head cocked slightly, as if listening to something none of them could hear. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d he said, then shook his head, scowling. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not alone, but I still don\u2019t recognize him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Emma asked, since everyone else seemed to know.</p> <p>\u201cMax\u2019s vampire ally.\u201d</p><p>Ari parked in front of the house, backing in next to a line of expensive cars which presumably belonged to Grafton\u2019s guests for the evening. Fortunately, it was a small party, so the senator hadn\u2019t bothered with a parking service of any kind. A pair of guards flanked the front door, but unlike their counterparts at the gate, these two wore suits and carried no visible weapons. Emma was quite certain they were armed, however, and she touched her own gun somewhat self-consciously. She was wearing a jacket that concealed the Glock 9 mm tucked into her waistband in back, but it still seemed obvious to her.</p><p>\u201cYou can still wait in the truck,\u201d Duncan said, for her ears only.</p><p>She turned her head sharply and scowled. \u201cI\u2019m going in,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>His lips curled slightly. \u201cIt was worth a shot,\u201d he murmured, then kissed her softly and added, \u201cBe careful, Emmaline.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan stroked his knuckles over the softness of Emma\u2019s cheek as Louis jumped out of the truck and pulled Duncan\u2019s door open. He stepped out onto the gravel drive, with Miguel right behind him. Emma made an exasperated noise and hurried to follow, but Duncan didn\u2019t wait. A whispered word dealt with the human guards as he climbed the steps and opened the front door. He found it curious that the guards were only human, when he knew for a fact that his vampire enemy was somewhere inside. Did the other vampire think Duncan could be fooled, that he wouldn\u2019t sense his presence? A vast underestimation, if true, and a fatal mistake. He\u2019d take great pleasure in pointing that out when they finally met.</p><p>Miguel and Louis were a step behind him to either side, as he walked into Grafton\u2019s house. Ari was next, then Emma, with Baldwin right beside her and the six vampires from the second SUV ranging behind. Once through the door, they fanned out, except for Baldwin who had orders to stick to Emma like glue.</p><p>The front door opened into a huge room. The ceiling lofted overhead to more than two stories, with thick beams crisscrossing the open space. The floor was marble, and furniture was sparse, although there were plenty of plants clustered in a way that split the room into more manageable spaces while still leaving it wide open. It was a space made for large gatherings, and it was completely empty.</p><p>Duncan wasn\u2019t fooled into thinking the house was empty, however. A quick sweep told him there were roughly twenty humans in the house, most of them gathered somewhere straight ahead. There were also . . . he paused briefly . . . twelve vampires, and among them he clearly tasted the mind of the master who\u2019d tampered with Clint Daniels\u2019s mind and suborned him into burning down Duncan\u2019s residence.</p><p>\u201cTwelve vampires, one master, twenty or so humans,\u201d he said quietly. Most of the vampires Duncan had brought with him were strong enough to detect the humans as easily as he did, but not all of them would accurately count their vampire opponents. And Emma could do neither. He wanted her far away from the fight, but he also wanted her to know what they were up against.</p><p>Duncan started across the room, not wasting breath to tell his people what to do. These were all seasoned security operatives; it was why he\u2019d chosen them. He slowed, then stopped a moment before the hard crack of boot heels announced what he already knew. Max Grafton was at last coming to greet his uninvited guests.</p> <p>\u201cMister Milford,\u201d Grafton said with false cordiality, entering the room through a corner doorway and walking toward them. \u201cI\u2019d heard you were dead. You\u2019ll forgive me for being disappointed to find the rumors were mistaken.\u201d He stopped ten feet away. \u201cAnd Ms. Duquet. You\u2019ve been far more trouble than you\u2019re worth, my dear. At least Lacey\u2014\u201d</p><p>His next words were trapped in his throat along with his ability to breathe. There was no reason for Emma to listen to this man\u2019s poisonous words about Lacey. Grafton was grabbing at his neck in a predictable, if useless, gesture. He could slit his own throat open, but still no air would reach his lungs until Duncan decided it was time. The senator fell to his knees and his face first turned red, then took on a bluish tint before Duncan released him.</p><p>Grafton fell forward, nearly doing a face plant as he sucked in a rasping breath and began coughing. \u201cYou bastard,\u201d he gasped, glaring up at Duncan while tears ran down his face.</p><p>Duncan grinned, baring his fangs. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting my time, Grafton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this.\u201d Grafton\u2019s voice was thready, but filled with hatred. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only game in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. Shall we get on with it?\u201d Duncan said, affecting boredom as his mind searched the house, looking for a trap.</p><p>It was Grafton\u2019s look of shock that finally drew his attention. \u201cYou know?\u201d Grafton sputtered.</p><p>Duncan spared the effort to look at the human directly. \u201cThat your pet vampire tried to burn down my house with me and mine in it? Of course\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s pet, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t move, only his eyes shifted to follow the voice, recognizing his enemy at last. \u201cPhoebe?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe Micheletti strolled into the room, granting Grafton a disdainful glance as she stepped around his still kneeling figure. She stopped in front of Duncan, hands on her hips. \u201cYou\u2019re surprised. Good.\u201d</p><p>Duncan gave a negligent shrug. \u201cI am. Not surprised enough to save you, but you were very clever.\u201d Inwardly, he was seething, mostly in anger at himself. They\u2019d never met in person before that first night at the grave site, but if he\u2019d taken her blood oath then, he\u2019d have known the taste of her mind and recognized later that she was the one who\u2019d tampered with his guard. But she\u2019d made damn certain he wouldn\u2019t think it necessary. Had she already been planning to suborn someone from his daylight guard? Or was it simply caution on her part?</p><p>Phoebe was glaring her hatred at him. \u201cTell me, Duncan,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cDid you ever think to ask if any of us wanted the territory before you swept in like a vengeful angel? I\u2019ve been waiting for more than a century\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it\u2019s done, Phoebe, and you know it. If you wanted the territory, you should have taken it. If it wasn\u2019t me, it would have been someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who deserves it, the one who\u2019s put up with Victor all these years, while\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was it you did for him?\u201d Duncan demanded. \u201cDispose of the bodies? Help him brutalize those women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cleaned up his messes, just like I do everyone else\u2019s, you bastard. That woman was already dead when I got there. All I did was get rid of her body so Victor\u2019s precious politicians could pretend it never happened. We were going to move it to someplace permanent, but then you showed up and everything went to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many others were there? How many women were tortured while you sat back like a fat spider, watching and waiting? Doing nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2018doing nothing,\u2019\u201d she lashed out angrily. \u201cI wasn\u2019t strong enough to take him on alone. I had to wait, to get stronger, smarter, become a better fighter, build my own backup.\u201d She made a beckoning gesture over her shoulder and vampires began to slip into the room behind her. \u201cI\u2019ve spent decades preparing, and now suddenly you appear out of nowhere, you and Raphael with your grand plans and your arrogance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael has always been fair with you. He treated you with respect, admiration even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d She fanned herself theatrically. \u201cAren\u2019t I simply the luckiest girl alive? Fuck Raphael,\u201d she snarled. \u201cI don\u2019t need his patronage, his pats on the head like I\u2019m some sort of clever pet or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never did that,\u201d Duncan snapped coldly. \u201cYou forget. I was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you were there. Always by his side, currying his favor. His favorite lapdog. Victor had that much right about you. And now here you are, with Raphael\u2019s blessing, I\u2019m sure. A territory of your own, a gift for serving him so well for so long. But there\u2019s something you don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Phoebe,\u201d Duncan said, cutting off her litany with a gentle smile. \u201cIt\u2019s you who doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He released his power then, letting it rush out of him like water trapped behind a suddenly open dam. It roared through the room like a hurricane, battering the vampires who stood staunchly at his back, sending Max Grafton shrieking across the slick marble floor to crash against a nearby trio of urns. Behind him, he was aware of Emma gasping in surprise, but standing strong, her determination to stay and fight not wavering for a moment.</p><p>Phoebe stared at him, her dark hair a wild nimbus around her head, her eyes widening briefly, before they narrowed to angry slits. Her hands fisted at her sides, and Duncan felt the draw of power as she called upon the vampires who\u2019d chosen to stand with her against him. One or two of those sent him triumphant glances, but the others avoided his gaze, as if hoping to escape detection. He scanned their faces quickly, not recognizing any of them. A more careful examination and he realized why. These were Phoebe\u2019s own, vampires she\u2019d made herself over the years while, according to her, she prepared for Victor\u2019s demise. But they were young\u2014the oldest was not even a hundred years, most far younger than that\u2014and none of them was a master. Their presence would still help Phoebe, as much as doubling her power, especially if she was willing to drain them dry in order to win. But in the end, it still came down to Phoebe versus Duncan. And Duncan would win that battle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It would sadden him to kill Phoebe. He\u2019d thought her a friend.

But she\u2019d tried to kill Duncan and all his vampires, had been willing to let Emma die in order to get to him. He could never forgive that. And as a vampire lord, he could never tolerate that kind of challenge to his rule. She had to die.</p><p>Duncan reached out from within the depths of his power and touched Phoebe\u2019s thoughts\u2014a brief touch, there and gone before she could sense the intrusion. He felt her determination, but also her fear for her husband, Ted Micheletti. They\u2019d been mated far too long for Ted to survive her death.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ted?\u201d Duncan asked quietly. \u201cWhat about all of these others?\u201d He gestured to the vampires who ranged behind her. \u201cSurrender to me, Phoebe, and they needn\u2019t die with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ted burst into the room from the hallway, pushing his way through Phoebe\u2019s vampires to reach her side. He was a big man, towering over his diminutive wife as he glared at Duncan. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare, Phoebe,\u201d he growled. \u201cDon\u2019t you let him sweet talk you into giving up. I\u2019ll stand with you \u2018til the end, my love. I want it no other way.\u201d</p><p>She spared him a tear-filled glance, then turned back to Duncan. Her jaw jutted forward with resolve. \u201cOn any given Sunday, Duncan,\u201d she said, borrowing from the idea that no contest has a forgone conclusion. \u201cI might surprise you.\u201d</p><p>Duncan gave her the respect of nodding in agreement, though the outcome was indeed forgone is this case. Even with her power doubled, Phoebe couldn\u2019t defeat him. She\u2019d been deluding herself all these years if she\u2019d thought she could have overthrown Victor, and Victor hadn\u2019t stood a chance with Duncan.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d he said. \u201cMiguel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p> <p>Hearing the tension in Miguel\u2019s voice, Duncan gave his lieutenant a quick half grin. \u201cNo worries, Miguelito,\u201d he said fondly. \u201cWatch my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, Sire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma!\u201d he called without taking his eyes off Phoebe. \u201cRemember your promise.\u201d He thought he heard a dismissive puff of breath from her, but it may have been his power rattling the foliage.</p><p>His point made, Duncan sucked his power in closer, aware of his vampires backing away to give him room and to avoid being caught in the deadly vortex of his defensive shield. The raw force of his unbound power, which had been tearing the room apart, shut off like a thrown switch. The room was silent in the aftermath as everyone froze, listening.</p><p>Duncan favored Phoebe with a cold look. \u201cLadies first,\u201d he said mockingly, intentionally pricking the pride he\u2019d felt from her earlier, the pride that had driven her to think she could become a vampire lord.</p><p>Phoebe reacted predictably, curling her hands into claws in front of her and screaming at him in rage. Duncan strengthened his shield in reflex, a move honed into an automatic reaction over decades of practice, requiring no thought on his part. But if he\u2019d had any doubts as to the outcome of this battle, they fled in the face of Phoebe\u2019s first assault. Driven by fury, carrying the full measure of her power, it was sucked into his defensive shield without a trace. There was not even a momentary dent to indicate its impact. Phoebe looked up and met his gaze, and he read the knowledge of failure in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cLast chance,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Duncan,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201dDuncan drew on his tremendous strength, forming a blade of pure power, invisible to the naked eye, but shining like a silver sword to those with eyes to see. Phoebe had such eyes. She saw the blade and howled in fury, dropping down to a crouch, making herself small as she sucked juice from her vampire children and wove their combined power into as tight a shield as she could make. One by one her vampires collapsed behind her as she sucked them dry. Even Ted crumpled to the floor, a trickle of blood leaking from his nose, as Phoebe pulled his small bit of energy back into herself in a desperate bid for survival.</p><p>Duncan was already stepping forward as Phoebe howled her defiance. He thrust the shining blade of his power through the spinning shell of his shield, slicing through Phoebe\u2019s defenses as if they weren\u2019t there, stabbing into her chest, shattering her ribs and piercing her heart.</p><p>Phoebe screamed as her heart exploded, as Ted convulsed and as her vampires died. Duncan held the blade in her heart until there was nothing left of the organ, until it was dust in her chest. He pulled the blade back then, drawing the power into himself, clenching his fist as if his fingers gripped a physical hilt. Dropping his shield, he took a step back . . . and stumbled, falling to his knees as a something with the force of a sledge hammer slammed into his back, tearing through muscle and bone, aiming for his heart.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Emma knew she was being herded. She knew Duncan had appointed Baldwin as her protector, probably on pain of death or something equally unpleasant. She didn\u2019t mind, because there was nothing she could do about it. If you\u2019re going to fall in love with a big, bad, alpha male, you have to accept the mile-wide protective streak that goes with it. So, she didn\u2019t fight Baldwin when he took her arm and moved her to one side, even though it made her feel like one of the potted plants, especially when Phoebe\u2014Phoebe!\u2014showed up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s pet,\u201d the traitorous bitch drawled as she strolled into the room, and Emma wished she had something to throw at her. Baldwin clearly felt the same way. He stiffened in surprise and took an aggressive step forward, closing ranks with Duncan\u2019s other vamps who were all bristling with anger, ready to defend Duncan. Emma stayed where she was, still and quiet, not wanting to draw any attention to herself for fear she\u2019d be hustled right out of the room. She wanted to see and hear what was going on!</p> <p>Her heart squeezed at the obvious grief in Duncan\u2019s voice when he tried to talk Phoebe out of what he clearly considered a suicide mission. Emma didn\u2019t know anything about vampire power, but she figured Phoebe had to die either way. She\u2019d tried to burn them all alive, after all. Duncan wasn\u2019t trying to save Phoebe; he was trying to save the others. He didn\u2019t seem worried at all for himself, just sad and resigned to what he had to do.</p><p>And then suddenly everything changed. Emma\u2019s skin prickled with energy, every hair on her body standing up as a whirlwind appeared out of nowhere and filled the huge room. Ceramic vases filled with greenery toppled over, breaking against the marble floor. Dirt and leaves were sucked up by the wind and sent spinning against the walls and windows like hail. Phoebe was staring at Duncan as if she\u2019d never seen him before, as if he was her worst nightmare come true. He was still talking to Phoebe, but Emma couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying above the noise. She heard Max Grafton scream, though, saw him rolling across the floor like a shrieking tumbleweed until he crashed into a cluster of big clay pots.</p><p>Wanting to hear what they were saying, Emma sidled a little closer, slipping behind and between clusters of plants until she was nearly even with where Duncan stood staring at Phoebe.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Duncan called suddenly.</p><p>She froze, certain he knew she\u2019d moved closer, that she was no longer safely hidden behind Baldwin\u2019s bulk.</p><p>\u201cRemember your promise,\u201d he said, and Emma puffed out a dismissive breath. Like she was going to run away if things went south. What was he thinking? But she no sooner had the thought, than everything changed again. Silence fell over the room like a thick blanket, and Emma crouched down, hiding.</p><p>\u201cLadies first,\u201d Duncan said, his voice thick with a mockery Emma had never heard from him before.</p><p>Electricity tingled along Emma\u2019s nerves, much stronger that what she\u2019d felt only moments before. That had been like static electricity on a dry summer day; this was a live wire skimming along her nerves. She shuddered and closed her eyes in pain, clenching her jaw against the urge to groan. When she opened them again, Phoebe was still standing opposite Duncan, but there was a resigned set to her shoulders, a weariness in the way she held herself despite her defiant gaze.</p><p>Duncan barely moved, standing cool and calm as always, his legs braced slightly apart, his weight on the balls of his feet. He raised his arm to chest height, and his fingers curled into his palm as if holding something there. He blinked lazily and the pressure in the room began to grow, slowly at first, then building as if all the air was being sucked out at once. Emma began to pant as her lungs worked overtime trying to collect enough oxygen. A weight crushed her chest, and she leaned back against the wall, suddenly weak and lightheaded, but determined to stay, to witness Phoebe\u2019s execution. She blinked, bewildered, as Duncan stabbed his hand outward, and then Phoebe screamed in agony. The vampires who\u2019d come into the room with Phoebe began to fall like flies, collapsing where they stood without a single sound. Not far from Emma, Max Grafton grunted, and she stiffened to attention. While she\u2019d been watching the action and trying to breathe, Grafton had woken enough to pull himself behind one of the few chairs in the room. He was hunkered down like a nasty troll, looking pale and sweaty, pressing a hand against his ribs as if they were injured. Emma hoped his ribs were broken. She hoped he\u2019d push too hard and one of them would puncture his lung and he\u2019d die of asphyxiation while everyone was too busy to notice. Except her.</p><p>Lost in images of Max Grafton\u2019s imminent death, Emma glanced over and saw Phoebe had curled into a ball on the floor. She was still screaming, but weaker now, fading quickly until she literally began falling apart. Duncan stared at her crumbling form dispassionately as he took a single step backward. A flash of movement brought Emma\u2019s gaze back to Grafton, and she screamed as he brought up a gun and shot Duncan in the back.</p><p>Emma was on the move. All around her vampires were racing to Duncan\u2019s side. Miguel was shouting orders, placing himself between Duncan and what was left of Phoebe\u2019s vampires as he searched for the enemy. But Emma already knew who the enemy was. Grafton still had his gun up, still aimed at Duncan, his finger compressing for a second shot as Duncan collapsed to his knees. Emma brought up her own gun and fired without thinking, three shots, tightly grouped, just like at the range. One, two, three, and Grafton went down. Emma raced over and kicked his gun away, dropping to her knees next to him. She stared at the grimace on his face, at the blood on his chest and bubbling from his mouth, and she froze, not quite believing what she\u2019d done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blinked, then whispered, \u201cDuncan,\u201d and spun around clumsily.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Miguel called. \u201cGet over here.\u201d</p><p>She was there before he snarled the last word, tears filling her eyes as she saw Duncan lying on the floor, eyes closed, blood pooling beneath him. \u201cIs he dead?\u201d she asked, her voice catching on a sob.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Miguel said shortly. \u201cBut he needs blood.\u201d</p><p>She looked up in confusion. \u201cBlood?\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired vamp gave her an impatient look. \u201cChrist,\u201d he swore. \u201cHe\u2019s a vampire. He\u2019s wounded. He needs blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Of course,\u201d she shook her head at her own stupidity. She handed someone her gun and began stripping off her jacket. \u201cDo you have something\u2014\u201d</p><p>Miguel was already handing her a knife\u2014a short, fat switchblade with a fancy handle, which he snapped out and handed to her grip first.</p> <p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt\u2019s sharp.\u201d</p><p>Emma stared at the blade, then shook her head, handing it back to him. \u201cYou do it,\u201d she said, holding out her wrist. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014 Ow!\u201d She gave Miguel a dirty look. \u201cA little warning would be nice, dude,\u201d she muttered, but quickly eased Duncan\u2019s head onto her lap and held her bloody wrist to his mouth. Did she need to rub it over his lips? Or maybe stroke his throat to get him to\u2014 Yikes!</p><p>Duncan latched onto her wrist, his fangs sinking into the flesh. It hurt, but only briefly as the euphoric in his bite did its magic and Emma began to feel . . . wonderful. Duncan\u2019s hands came up to hold her wrist in place, and she leaned her upper body over his, needing to get closer to him, but also wanting to conceal the obvious signs of her growing desire. She only hoped Duncan would stop before too long, otherwise, she was going to\u2014</p><p>\u201cEmma.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes to find Duncan gazing up at her. He was no longer sucking at her wrist, but the heat in his eyes told her he was aware of her arousal and returned it in spades. He licked her wrist slowly and thoroughly, the coagulant in his saliva sealing the wound while the feel of his tongue against her skin did nothing to cool her hunger for him.</p><p>He gave her a half smile, then reached up and brushed his knuckles over her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were dead,\u201d she whispered, holding on to him tightly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI have too much to live for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Miguel said, reaching out to place a hand on Duncan\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201dDuncan put Emma gently aside and accepted the hand-up his lieutenant offered, while Baldwin lifted Emma to her feet and began wrapping her arm in one of the ever-present white handkerchiefs. They were no sooner on their feet than Miguel was hustling them out of the house to the waiting SUVs.</p><p>\u201cAri,\u201d Miguel called. \u201cYou drive. Baldwin will go with you. We\u2019ll clean up here, my lord,\u201d he added to Duncan, \u201cand follow in the other truck.\u201d</p><p>Duncan paused on the front steps long enough for Emma to catch up. He took her hand as she emerged from the house, then he slid into the backseat of the SUV and pulled her in with him.</p><p>Two minutes later, they were racing through the night, heading back to the house in D.C.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d Emma asked, anxiously. \u201cI mean what about all those other people, and\u2014\u201d She shuddered slightly. \u201c\u2014Grafton\u2019s body?\u201d</p> <p>They didn\u2019t need to worry about Phoebe\u2019s body or those of her vampires. They were already just so much dust on the floor. No one would even notice it amidst the wreckage from the fight between Phoebe and Duncan. Emma still didn\u2019t understand how that worked, but those questions could wait. On the other hand, Grafton\u2019s body needed to be taken care of now.</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d she said, when he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cOne moment,\u201d he replied, and Emma realized he wasn\u2019t talking to her. He was on his Bluetooth to someone, probably one of the vamps who\u2019d stayed back at Grafton\u2019s. He turned, pulling her against him more tightly, tucking her head into the curve of his shoulder. \u201cRest, Emmaline. Everything is taken care of, you\u2019ll see. This is nothing we haven\u2019t dealt with before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not going to jail for killing a senator?\u201d she asked drowsily, thinking it must be blood loss that was making her so tired.</p><p>Duncan chuckled. \u201cNo, you are most certainly not going to jail. What would I do without you?\u201d</p><p>Emma yawned, then frowned, wondering if he\u2019d done something to make her sleep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the adrenaline,\u201d Duncan said, reading her with his usual accuracy. \u201cIt\u2019s a rush, but when it crashes, it crashes hard, and so do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d she said, snuggling against his broad chest. She felt Duncan\u2019s lips as he kissed the top of her head, and then her eyes closed and she slept.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>Emma managed to keep herself from jumping in surprise. Duncan moved so quietly sometimes, it was as if he appeared from out of nowhere. He kissed her bare shoulder in apology and she knew she hadn\u2019t managed to conceal her reaction after all.</p><p>Lying on her stomach on the bed with her laptop in front of her, she sneaked a peek through the heavy fall of her hair, watching as he settled next to her and sat cross-legged to work with his own laptop. As always, his presence created a strange pressure in her chest, like there was something inside that was too big to stay there. She recognized the feeling, even though she\u2019d never experienced it before meeting Duncan. She was in love. Hopelessly, madly in love. But he was just so . . . wonderful. Not only his looks, though sitting there with his chest bare, blond hair hanging loose over his shoulders, and nothing but a pair of loose, gray sweatpants keeping him decent, he certainly looked scrumptious enough. But it was more than that. He was a good man in every way. And he was hers. She knew that for a fact. Duncan kept his emotions tightly in check most of the time, but not with her. He loved her. He told her so all the time, and he showed her in a million different ways.</p><p>She still had trouble believing it sometimes. She\u2019d wake up and put her hand out, expecting to find the space next to her empty, expecting to discover it was all a dream. But he was always there, always ready. She smiled to herself.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, startled out of her fantasies of stripping him naked and having her wicked way with him.</p><p>Duncan grinned knowingly at her. Not bothering to wait for her answer to his earlier question, he leaned over and scanned the screen of her laptop for himself. \u201cWant ads?\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I need a job. Even if I move in here\u2014\u201d His teeth closed gently on her shoulder in warning. \u201cEven though I\u2019m living here with you,\u201d she amended, and he kissed the same spot he\u2019d bitten. \u201cI still have expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can work for me then,\u201d he said, as if that settled the matter. And as far as he was concerned, it probably did. He was so used to making all the decisions, giving orders and having everyone snap to. But Emma wasn\u2019t one of his vampires, and she wasn\u2019t a charity case, either.</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly would I do?\u201d she asked skeptically.</p><p>Duncan shrugged. \u201cThe same thing you did for that limp dick congressman you worked for.\u201d</p><p>Emma snickered at his description of Guy Coffer and asked, \u201cYou get a lot of constituent complaints from vampireland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I am the representative of vampireland to the American government, and most of that business takes place during the day. You could be my daytime face in the halls of Congress.\u201d</p><p>Emma turned her head sharply to regard him. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.Why not?\u201d</p><p>Emma considered it. Why not indeed? She was certainly qualified to do something like that, and wouldn\u2019t it chafe Sharon Coffer\u2019s ass to see Emma roaming the marbled halls of the Capitol again? She smiled to herself and Duncan chuckled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very sinister smile you have there, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Duncan said, absently skimming something on his laptop, probably one of the many daily reports he received from his various employees, everyone from that vampire builder Alaric to Jackson Hissong and Miguel. \u201cWe can discuss . . . well, hello there!\u201d</p><p>Emma actually looked over to see if someone had walked into their room, then realized he was reacting to something on his computer screen. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, stretching up and trying to read over his arm.</p><p>\u201cTammy Dietrich is back,\u201d he said, leaning forward to read more closely.</p><p>Emma sat up. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>He indicated the report on his screen. \u201cI\u2019ve had someone watching her office. She showed up there early this morning, looking very furtive. Big hat and sun glasses, but it was definitely her. Apparently she heard about Max\u2019s untimely death and decided it was safe to come home.\u201d</p><p>Emma suppressed a flutter of fear. \u201cWhat\u2019s the latest from the police on that? Max\u2019s death, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re calling it a home invasion gone bad, with Grafton shot and killed defending his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police are buying that?\u201d</p><p>Duncan snorted derisively. \u201cNone of Max\u2019s heirs want the authorities digging too deeply into old Max\u2019s extracurricular activities, and especially not his finances. They\u2019ve decided to let him die a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Emma said, pretending it was only anger making her stomach clench.</p><p>Duncan wasn\u2019t fooled, of course. He gave her a searching look and said, \u201cYou did the right thing, Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. He was trying to kill you. And he did kill Lacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet his death bothers you.\u201d</p><p>Emma frowned. \u201cNot that he\u2019s dead, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Emmaline. Killing a man should never be easy.\u201d He studied her face as if trying to decide something. \u201cI could take it away, you know. Make you forget.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma stared at him. He expected her to reject the idea outright. She could tell by the careful way he\u2019d suggested it, by the way he was looking at her right now, waiting for her to blow up at him. But she didn\u2019t. She hated herself for it, but she seriously considered letting him take the whole thing away\u2014the misplaced guilt, the fear that there was something wrong with her that she could kill a man in cold blood like that, even if he did deserve it.</p><p>\u201cI might take you up on that someday,\u201d she said finally. \u201cBut not yet.\u201d</p><p>Duncan smiled in relief, his eyes going that warm brown that made him appear so human. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p> <p>His phone rang, which was unexpected. It was Sunday evening and he\u2019d decided that Sundays would be theirs alone. Miguel and the others had been told not to bother him unless it was something urgent. Emma frowned, but Duncan grinned, then leaned over and picked up his cell phone without even checking caller ID.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d he said, his tone a mixture of warmth and respect. \u201cWe are well,\u201d he continued, obviously answering the caller\u2019s query. \u201cNo permanent house yet, but that\u2019s coming along. And everyone there?\u201d He laughed, his body language relaxed and easy. Emma rarely saw Duncan like that, except with her.</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d he asked now. \u201cWell, that\u2019s true enough.\u201d He listened a while longer, then said, \u201cShe\u2019ll be coming with me.\u201d He laughed again and added, \u201cIt should be interesting.\u201d</p><p>Emma eyed him narrowly, since clearly he was now talking about her. And what would be so damn interesting?</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it, Sire. Until then.\u201d</p> <p>He disconnected and threw the phone back onto the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat was Raphael.\u201d</p><p>She already knew that. There was only one person Duncan called by the honorific Sire, because there was only one Sire, for Duncan anyway. \u201cI know that,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhat was he calling about?\u201d And what was so damned funny? she wanted to add, but didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Vampire Council meeting in two weeks,\u201d Duncan said, giving her a brilliant smile. \u201cWe\u2019re going to California.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>Lucas Donlon, Vampire Lord, ruler of a slice of North America that the vampires called the Plains Territory, scanned the conference room from behind his sunglasses. He didn\u2019t need the glasses. Their host for this meeting was Raphael, and unlike that lunatic Krystof, who\u2019d hosted the last meeting of North America\u2019s Vampire Council, Raphael would never have anything as gauche as fluorescent lighting in his conference room. But Lucas kept the glasses on anyway. It made it easier to keep his thoughts to himself, among other things. There were too many nosey vamps among his fellow vampire lords, and since they\u2019d all sworn off dipping into each other\u2019s minds, they were reduced to looking for visual clues. What a laugh riot that was.</p><p>And what a cheery group they were, too. Eight vampires ranged around a conference table that could easily have seated four times that many, because they didn\u2019t trust one another enough to sit any closer. Or maybe it was that they had no desire to get any closer. They met once a year to discuss matters of mutual interest, but they were hardly friends. Actually, they weren\u2019t friends at all. Lucas himself counted only one of those seated at this table as a friend, and that was Duncan. Some of the others were friendly antagonists, while one was an avowed enemy, and two were so new to the Council that Lucas had no opinion. Rajmund he at least knew from the vamp\u2019s long service as lieutenant to the finally dead Krystof\u2014now there was a vampire who\u2019d needed to be put down. But the newest member of their august circle, Sophia, he\u2019d never even heard of until she popped up as Lord of the Canadian Territories. Not that he gave a damn either way. As long as she kept to her borders, he\u2019d keep to his.</p><p>\u201cYour vote, Lucas?\u201d Raphael\u2019s deep voice interrupted Lucas\u2019s contemplation of his fellow lords. Lucas didn\u2019t move from his slouched position at the oval table. He shifted his gaze to Raphael and lowered his glasses enough to look over them.</p><p>\u201cAffirmative,\u201d he said flatly, then raised the glasses to cover his eyes once again. Gods willing, the others would vote the same way and they could all get the hell out of here. Not that Malibu was a bad place to be. He just didn\u2019t like the company much.</p><p>It seemed to take forever, and he had to endure, or ignore, more than one boring speech, but eventually the others all voted to affirm Duncan as Lord of the Capital Territory. It was the only territory that required such a vote, and only because of the unique demands imposed on its lord. They\u2019d all agreed to the condition about a century ago, even Victor who\u2019d laughed at the time, assuming it would never become an issue. Arrogant ass that he was, he\u2019d never understood that he was the issue. The rest of them had been waiting ever since then for someone to take that bastard out. Thank God it had finally happened, and thank God it was Duncan who\u2019d done it. Lucas didn\u2019t think anyone else could have gotten approval from the full council.</p><p>\u201cThe resolution passes,\u201d Raphael said, stating the obvious. He stood almost immediately, seeming as eager as the rest of them to get the meeting over with. Probably more so, since it was his home that had been invaded by the lords and their security details.</p><p>Lucas unfolded himself from the chair, pushing it back from the table with the same motion. He waited while the others hurried out the door, a few stopping to congratulate Duncan, including Raj, who paused long enough to shake hands. Raj and Duncan had been lieutenants to their respective lords a very long time. Lucas supposed that created a certain familiarity with one another. And their territories shared a border, so it couldn\u2019t hurt that they were at least friendly. Of course, his own friendship with Duncan went back much further than that.</p><p>Raphael was the last to leave, his black eyes holding Lucas\u2019s gaze for a long moment despite the glasses until, finally, he murmured something to Duncan and disappeared between the big double doors. Duncan grinned at Lucas as he made his way around the table.</p> <p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d Lucas said warmly. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Duncan shook the proffered hand. \u201cYou can take the damn glasses off now.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed and slipped the unnecessary glasses into the pocket of his suit jacket. \u201cI only wear them to piss off Raphael. Somebody\u2019s gotta keep the big guy humble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late, my friend. That ship sailed long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I do what I can. You leaving right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. We\u2019ll spend the night, but there\u2019s too much to do back in D.C. to remain any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, is it? I\u2019d heard you found yourself a honey back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could as easily have been referring to Miguel and Louis,\u201d Duncan said mildly.</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t. It\u2019s all in the we, my friend. So, is she a sweet, old-fashioned Southern girl then? Someone to rub your feet and wash your socks?\u201d</p><p>Duncan laughed. \u201cHardly, though Emma is Southern\u2014and sweet when she chooses. She\u2019s around somewhere. Drinking wine with Raphael\u2019s mate Cynthia, I believe, though I should probably track her down. One shudders to think what trouble those two could get into.\u201d</p><p>Lucas accepted Duncan\u2019s statement for what it was\u2014a polite way of acknowledging that he knew Raphael was waiting to meet with Lucas. Duncan had been Raphael\u2019s lieutenant and confidante for almost a hundred and fifty years, and while his assumption of the Capital lordship took him away from Raphael\u2019s day-to-day operations, it changed nothing about their friendship. Just as Duncan\u2019s new lordship changed nothing about the friendship he shared with Lucas.</p><p>They walked out together, going their separate ways after shaking hands once more and promising to stay in touch. Duncan turned for the stairs, while Lucas started down the long hallway, heading for Raphael\u2019s office in the other wing. He\u2019d left his security downstairs, not wanting any more witnesses than necessary to this meeting. He trusted his people, for the most part, but he was in no danger from anyone within Raphael\u2019s estate, so there was no reason to take a chance.</p><p>The black, carved doors opened upon his approach, and he considered putting the sunglasses back on. He discarded the idea almost immediately, however. They had business to discuss, and Raphael had never appreciated Lucas\u2019s irreverent approach to serious matters.</p><p>Raphael looked up from behind his desk as Lucas strolled into the room. The doors closed right behind him with a whoosh of air, barely clearing his ass. Lucas grinned briefly, but approached the desk and gave a sincerely respectful bow from the waist.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you for seeing me.\u201d</p><p>Raphael studied him for a suspicious moment, then gestured at the two comfortable chairs in front of the desk. \u201cSit down, Lucas. Where are your sunglasses?\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed then. \u201cDuncan told me not to wear them.\u201d</p><p>Raphael permitted a smile to edge around his mouth. \u201cTell me what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Klemens,\u201d Lucas said referring to the Midwestern Vampire Lord who\u2019d been glaring at him across the table moments before. \u201cHe\u2019s pecking away at my eastern border. I held off until Duncan was confirmed, because you asked me, too, and because it was something we both wanted. But I can\u2019t put up with it any longer. My own people are starting to doubt that I have the will to hold on to my territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Raphael swore. \u201cWhat does he want?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shrugged. \u201cI suspect he wants my entire Plains territory to combine with his own. It\u2019s always ground at him that yours is bigger than his.\u201d He punctuated this statement with an irreverent wink, which Raphael ignored. \u201cHe\u2019ll settle for anything he can chip off, though,\u201d Lucas continued. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael agreed. \u201cSo, what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing until after next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy next week?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cThe FBI\u2019s coming to see me,\u201d Lucas said, relaxing now that his real reason for the meeting was resolved.</p><p>\u201cThe FBI?\u201d Raphael said. \u201cWhat have you done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire!\u201d Lucas said, placing a hand over his heart and pretending to be wounded by the accusation. Raphael gave him a look of disgust, so Lucas said, \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything that I know of. Some FBI chick has been calling. And not only us, either. She called the local sheriff, too. Claims she\u2019s looking for a lost person and thinks he disappeared in our area. I\u2019ve checked with my people and nobody\u2019s heard of him.
