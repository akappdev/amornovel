Okay\u2014I like that. Who wouldn\u2019t? Never have I wanted someone so badly, and never has anyone wanted me the way Eli does. But I think he wants to turn me, and that sort of freaks me out. I don\u2019t want to live forever. It\u2019s not ... natural. I\u2019m not scared of him or anything, but let\u2019s just say I sleep with one eye open.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>Da Island, Gullah</p><p>Off the coast of Savannah, Georgia</p><p>mid-September</p> <p>\u201cHold her down!\u201d</p><p>Fire ripped through my insides, through my veins, under my skin, deep into my muscles, and I thrashed against the three pairs of strong arms trying to hold me still\u2014I didn\u2019t know why or who they were. I didn\u2019t know where I was. I saw nothing but blood behind my eyes, streaks of crimson blurring my vision, and my head pounded with each sluggish thump of my exaggerated heartbeat. I knew only pain, and I wanted to get the freaking hell away from it, out of the tangled arms trying to restrain me. \u201cGet the fuck off me!\u201d I gritted through my teeth. Their grips tightened. The air was smoldering hot all around me as if it poured from a five-hundred-degree oven. It made the burning inside my body even more intense, and the heavy scent of salt and rotted sea life wafted to me. I wanted to puke.</p><p>\u201cI liked it better when she couldn\u2019t move,\u201d a voice I knew but couldn\u2019t place said sarcastically. It had a slight French accent.</p><p>I kicked out hard and caught someone on the jaw with my heel. A muffled curse and laughter reached my ears. I didn\u2019t care. I was in friggin\u2019 agony, and getting out of it was all that mattered. I fought harder, growling and spitting. An all-consuming hate filled me. I felt it through my skin, all the way to my bones. Finally, I broke free. I scrambled on all fours but didn\u2019t make it far. Someone\u2019s full body slammed me into the scorching sand, and I lay there, trapped, under the crushing weight\u2014in anguish. I swore, but the sound came out muffled as coarse grains pushed into my open mouth. Whatever was on top of me was squeezing the breath out of me. I coughed. Air had a hard time getting back into my lungs. I wheezed.</p><p>\u201cEase up, Zetty,\u201d another familiar voice said. \u201cYou\u2019re pushing her face into the sand. She can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>Zetty? What the hell? An unfamiliar, guttural sound came from the weight trapping me. I bucked, or tried to, anyway.</p> <p>\u201cHere, give this to her,\u201d another voice said. \u201cFast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou give it to her, Bro.\u201d</p><p>I heard a muttered curse, then felt a sharp pinprick in my ass. I bucked again, hard. I screamed, but it was no use. I lay there in the sand, with a big, heavy-ass Zetty stretched out on top of me as I cursed and wailed, until a drugging, calming haze swept over me, pulling me down. The pain eased, my lids grew heavy, and, finally, shadows crowded me, claiming me. I knew nothing else, and that was freaking fine by me. For however long, I slept.</p><p>A breeze drifted over my skin and across my face, and I cracked open my eyes. I anticipated pain, and that unbearable burning, but thankfully, there was none. My vision was blurry, but long shadows fell over me, accompanied by the cooler temperature of the afterlight, making everything around me hazy.</p><p>\u201cHey, you.\u201d</p><p>Only then did I notice strong fingers interlaced with mine, and I turned my head and blinked several times until Eli\u2019s face, lit by a kerosene lamp, came into focus. Dark shadows melded against perfect, pale skin, and the contrast made my breath catch. Had I ever feared him? Even now, it was hard for me to imagine his face contorted into the monster I knew he could become. He bent closer, and I inhaled his unique, drugging scent. \u201cHey,\u201d I said, my voice scratchy, sore, and broken. \u201cWhat happened? I feel as if a train hit me.\u201d I did, too. My whole body ached, down to the bone\u2014almost to the cellular level. Grinding my teeth together, I noticed grit. Sand?</p><p>\u201cYeah, sand,\u201d Eli said, brushing my hair back from my forehead. \u201cAnd your body aches because Zetty threw his full weight onto you. Damn, he\u2019s one big Tibetan.\u201d I found a bottle of water pressed to my lips. \u201cRinse and drink.\u201d I did. Eli then leaned down and pressed his mouth to mine. A thrill shot through me, and my insides fluttered as the pressure of Eli\u2019s lips settled, moved, tasted, caressed.</p><p>Possessed.</p> <p>The pressure eased, and Eli pulled back, his darkening gaze fastened on mine. The small silver hoop still adorned his brow, and I decided I seriously liked it. \u201cYou fight like a wildcat.\u201d The corner of his mouth tipped upward into the sexiest grin I\u2019d ever seen. He nuzzled my neck. \u201cTurns me on,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet it does, freak,\u201d I said lightly. I laughed, shaking off the erotic shiver that coursed through my body at his seductive words. A powerful surge of desire for Eli gripped me, and, to be frank, it sort of took me off guard. It was strong. And not just midtwenties, hotblooded American girl, horny strong. It was powerful as hell.</p><p>Eli\u2019s striking blue eyes darkened even more, turning almost stormy in color as he stared down at me. \u201cIt\u2019s one of your tendencies,\u201d he said, and he stroked my bottom lip with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d I asked, shivering.</p><p>\u201cYour extreme horniness,\u201d he answered proudly. \u201cDefinitely a perk, not that you had any problem before\u2014\u201d</p><p>My hand over his mouth stopped his words, and I grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re in big trouble now, Dupr\u00e9,\u201d I said, my voice raspy, deeper than usual, and I slipped my hand around his neck, pulling his mouth to mine.</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d Eli whispered against me.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d I said, and parted his lips with my tongue, kissing him deeply. A thousand sensations blasted through me at once as an intense, almost unbearable heat pooled between my legs. In the next second, a burst of power exploded from my body as I grabbed Eli, flipped him over, off the makeshift bed of pillows and quilts, and onto the hard-packed sand. A small grunt escaped his throat, and for some reason, I liked that. I pinned him beneath me, my legs straddling his waist, my crotch grinding against him, my knees digging into the coarse sand and my hands trapping his above his head. All in under three seconds. Swear to God.</p><p>Eli Dupr\u00e9 did nothing more than smile. And it was a wicked, wicked smile.</p><p>With such speed I surprised myself, I gathered both of his hands in one, and before my brain even registered my actions, I was reaching for his button fly. I wanted him, and I meant to have him\u2014yesterday.</p><p>The dark glimmer in Eli\u2019s eyes meant he was going to let me.</p><p>I had three buttons undone, my hand inside his jeans, and a low moan emitting from Eli\u2019s throat when a voice interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, girl,\u201d Phin said, way too close. \u201cNot in front of the children, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, dude. Get a room.\u201d</p><p>Laughter erupted around me, deep male chuckles mixed with squeaky adolescent ones.</p><p>In the next instant, my body left Eli\u2019s, and I was lifted and settled hard on my feet, outside the open-air tent in which I\u2019d been attacking Eli. I turned, and a small flickering campfire cast amber light into laughing green eyes filled with mischief. \u201cYeah, Sis. Especially not in front of the children. That\u2019s just ... gross.\u201d</p><p>I leapt and threw my arms around my brother. \u201cSeth!\u201d I said, burying my face against the strong column of his neck. It was the first time I\u2019d seen him since, well, before. When he\u2019d been in transition, before his almost-quickening. \u201cOh my God, I\u2019ve missed you!\u201d My heart literally pounded with sheer joy. I had my brother back! I squeezed tighter, and happiness shot through me.</p><p>Seth\u2019s long arms hugged me tightly, and he lifted me off the ground. \u201cI missed you, too, Ri.\u201d A small crack in his voice let me know just how emotional my little brother really was.</p><p>I hugged him for a long, long time and, finally, after drawing in his familiar scent, I pulled back and looked at him\u2014really looked at him. Bare-chested, barefoot, and wearing only a pair of low-slung black board shorts that hung to his knees, he seemed ... different. Way different\u2014not the teenage brother I\u2019d known a month before. Without even thinking, I touched his face, then his jaw. Pushing aside the dark sweep of hair from his forehead, I felt the growing muscles in his chest, the rocks carved into his stomach. I turned him around and checked out his lean back. His normally pale skin was tanned from the sun, and, just below the board shorts, I saw a strip of colorless skin where his tan ended and his white butt began. Just as fast, I turned him back around to face me. I blinked. He hardly looked like my baby brother. It wasn\u2019t that he looked older or anything. Just ... different. Can someone look wiser? I stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed, Bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d he said proudly, and gave himself a quick glance. \u201cI\u2019ve been working out with Zetty and the guys.\u201d Then, his face grew serious, his eyes somber, and worry lines gathered between his brows. \u201cAre you gonna be all right?\u201d</p><p>For whatever reason, his concern worried me. I glanced at Phin, Luc, then Eli, before turning back to Seth. \u201cOf course,\u201d I assured him, and punched his arm. \u201cNo prob. I feel better already, just seeing you.\u201d I did, too. It seemed like forever since I\u2019d seen him. Normal, that is. If you could call what we\u2019d become normal. I stared at my brother a little more. Something struck me, deep inside\u2014a twinge. My gaze moved from his face to his throat, and there it lingered. The pulse of his heart barely lifted the skin there, keeping in sync with the beat as the blood pulsed through his veins. I became transfixed, staring at that spot. Inside my body, seemingly just beneath the surface, I quivered.</p><p>Seth studied me a few seconds more, grinned, and draped an arm over my shoulders. \u201cGood. So, you wanna hang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not a good idea,\u201d Eli said, glancing at me before meeting Seth\u2019s gaze. \u201cNot alone, anyway. At least, not for a while.\u201d He gave me a slight smile. \u201cStill working out a few kinks.\u201d He pulled my arm. What was wrong with me? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Luc said with a laugh, giving me a twinkling-eyed look. \u201cKinks. That\u2019s what they call it now. Kinks.\u201d</p><p>It was only then I noticed the others. Phin, Luc, and Josie stood behind Seth, along with several of the teens who\u2019d been on the verge of become newling vamps.</p><p>\u201cSmokin\u2019 hot as usual, babe,\u201d Riggs Parker said from the small crowd. He pushed closer, his shaggy dark hair hanging across his eyes. With a quick flip of his head, he whipped his hair aside. \u201cI\u2019ll work the kinks out with you, Riley.\u201d</p> <p>Luc smacked Riggs on the back of the head. Everyone laughed. Riggs merely shrugged and grinned. \u201cCan\u2019t blame a dude for tryin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>So Riggs had made it. Still a freaking little pervert, and cocky as always, but he\u2019d made it. I noticed the same pulsing point at his throat that I\u2019d noticed on Seth, but I shook my head and forced myself not to fixate on it. I glanced around at the familiar faces, and some new ones, and then looked at Eli. \u201cSo, what is this? Some weird vampy version of Lord of the Flies? Or Vamp Camp?\u201d Then, it hit me, and I scowled. \u201cWhat kinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, time to go,\u201d Luc said, and gave Riggs a push. \u201cI think Eli can handle this. Come on, guys. Ricky\u2019s got some \u2019splainin\u2019 to do. Estelle has dinner ready, anyway.\u201d With a series of shrill whoops, the Lord of the Flies boys, all bare to the waist and wearing various colors of board shorts, took off with Luc. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder exactly what dinner was going to be. I glanced around. Zetty stood, arms crossed over his big chest and his eyes trained on me. I\u2019d never seen Zetty dressed in anything except his traditional Tibetan clothes\u2014a long red yak wool wrap and baggy black pants tucked into short leather boots. He now wore, like the others, a pair of baggy board shorts. His were red. The handwoven, multicolored sheath crossed his bare chest, encasing the traditional Nepali knife he never went anywhere without. He didn\u2019t say a word. He, too, had a pulse point that drew my attention. His hand slipped up and covered the spot; then he glared at me. His shiny black brows were furrowed, and the unique red and yellow tattooed squares and dots that marked him as a once-Shiva follower sat stark against his tanned forehead. They made him look unapproachable; scary. And I\u2019d apparently done something to piss him off.</p><p>Seth pulled me out of thought and into a tight hug. \u201cI love you, Ri,\u201d he said against my ear. \u201cSwear to God, I\u2019ll never leave you again.\u201d</p><p>That boy always could melt my heart. I hugged him fiercely back. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to,\u201d I assured him, even though his concern really concerned me. I pulled back and studied him. \u201cNow go. Eat. I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p> <p>Seth held my gaze for several seconds. \u201cYou probably won\u2019t be, but it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll be there when you\u2019re ready.\u201d He smiled, presenting a sincere, winsome look that made him seem mature beyond his fifteen years. Then he turned to Zetty. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Zet-Man.\u201d The two took off up the beach, Seth\u2019s tanned body alongside Zetty\u2019s, well, huge one, melding into the afterlight. I stared after my brother, my jaw dropping in wonder at the speed at which Seth ran\u2014and how Zetty could almost keep up. The mystical man from Nepal had a long black braid that whipped from side to side as he ran. I stared until my vision blurred. \u201cWhoa,\u201d I muttered, and shook my head. \u201cWeird.\u201d In the distance, I saw another campfire, larger, close to the shore, its orange hues and blue sparks reaching toward the darkening sky. A small figure huddled close to the flames. Squinting, I made out the colorful fabric patches of Estelle\u2019s familiar billowy skirt.</p><p>A nervous twinge gripped me. Something was up. I was purposely being kept apart from everyone. I wanted to spend time with my brother, and I missed my Gullah grandparents. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d I asked Eli. The look in Seth\u2019s eyes had disturbed me.</p><p>Strong arms slid around my waist from behind, and Eli pulled me against him tightly. He rested his chin on my shoulder, his lips close to my ear. I shuddered and leaned my head against his chest. \u201cTell me,\u201d I said. \u201cEverything. I can\u2019t remember anything except waking up on Da Island, unable to move. And I don\u2019t even know how long ago that was.\u201d</p><p>Eli sighed and held me tighter. \u201cYour body is going through d.t.\u2019s, sort of,\u201d he said. \u201cYour recovery is going a little slower than we\u2019d hoped. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here almost two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I\u2019d lost two weeks out of my life. \u201cD.t\u2019s? From what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Arcoses\u2019 venom. It has tainted your blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked, and, swear to God, my blood at that moment suddenly felt several degrees colder.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m serious,\u201d he said. He cocked his head and studied me. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me taking you to Da Island, after Bonaventure?\u201d</p><p>I thought, then shook my head. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Eli nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad. You were not in a good way, Riley. We had to contain you and the others, and staying in the city would have been risky. So we brought the almost-newlings\u2014you, Seth, the others\u2014to Da Island for rehab. You got the worst of it since both Arcoses infected you. Although your blood and their venom were mixed for only a short time, it was long enough for you to become addicted to it\u2014intensely addicted, from the moment they bit you. Your body craves it now, and there\u2019s no way to tell how long it will last. You\u2019ve been in d.t.\u2019s the whole time with only short periods of lucidity. Like now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what was wrong with me a few minutes ago?\u201d I asked, my throat tightening at the thought. \u201cI ... was staring at the pulses in Seth\u2019s throat, in Zetty\u2019s, Riggs\u2019. As if I wanted it. Wanted their blood.\u201d With the pads of my fingers, I pushed against my closed eyes, then looked up at him. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me I could snap at any second like some animal? Attack Seth? That\u2019s what I\u2019d felt a second ago. As if I wanted to jump on him.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo freaking way, Eli. I want it out of me.\u201d</p><p>Eli gripped my shoulders and stared sternly at me. \u201cPreacher has been working crazy hours to flush your system safely. The side effects are ... extreme. Out of control.\u201d He turned me around and stared down at me. With his thumb, he grazed my jaw. \u201cRiley, you will always carry some of their DNA. And that makes you more than a little unpredictable. But I can handle you. We will work through this. Together. I won\u2019t leave you alone for a second. Understand?\u201d</p><p>I watched the play of firelight dance across his features, noticing how it threw parts of his face into dark shades and jagged planes. I would always have a little Arcos in me? That bothered the hell out of me. At least the d.t.\u2019s would eventually go away. I didn\u2019t like eyeballing my brother\u2019s arteries. \u201cThe pain?\u201d I asked, remembering the torturous feeling that had gripped me into a feral insanity. \u201cWill it come back?\u201d</p><p>Eli nodded. \u201cYes, it will. It\u2019s not over yet,\u201d he said, and I could plainly see how much he hated telling me, or rather, how much he hated that it would happen. \u201cI hate it way more than you can imagine,\u201d he said, reading my thoughts. \u201cIt kills me to see you in agony, and that I can\u2019t do a goddamn thing about it pisses me off even more.\u201d In the firelight, his eyes darkened dangerously, and I knew then that to be on Eli Dupr\u00e9\u2019s bad side could be a frightening thing. Luckily, he liked me.</p> <p>I pushed aside my mounting fear and braved a big fake smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dupr\u00e9. I can handle it,\u201d I said, and slipped my arms around his waist. \u201cEasy peasy. No prob. Just make sure I don\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>With a muttered French curse, Eli shook his head. \u201cAlways a badass, huh, Poe?\u201d he said, then cocked his head at me and smiled. \u201cI truly dig that about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d I answered, and grazed his lips slowly with mine. Then, Eli kissed me\u2014the kiss possessive, hard, erotic\u2014and for so long I lost my breath. At some point, I lost consciousness\u2014as in totally passed out. I\u2019d like to say Eli\u2019s intense, passionate kissing/making out rocked my world so hard that I fainted, but only later did I realize what had really happened, and for how long.</p><p>Nightmares plagued me; hunger plagued me worse. I crawled around on all fours, lunging and gnashing at anything that happened by. Heartbeats thumped all around me, and I could hear blood rushing through vessels. I wanted it. I needed it.</p><p>I fought to get it. I didn\u2019t care whose it was.</p><p>The big one had to have a lot; I could smell it, almost taste it on my tongue. Like a cat, I waited; he grew close. I leapt, wrapped my legs around his waist, and used all my strength to hold him still. I wanted what pumped through his veins. Hands grasped me; voices yelled. I was pulled off. I thrashed; my body writhed; on all fours I scrambled away. My senses alerted me to another\u2014a smaller one\u2014but the resonating whoosh-whoosh of the substance I craved pumping through his body beckoned me. I crouched, then lunged, wrapping my whole body around him to prevent escape. Something coldcocked me in the head\u2014in the fucking head! I flew back, my prize released, and I hit the ground hard. Air left my lungs. My head throbbed. I lay there, seeing nothing but darkness and stars. My chest rose and fell. My heart barely beat. Stillness washed over me. I was unsure whether I was sleeping or dead.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t dead; I\u2019d learned a lesson. Pretending to be asleep, I waited for another to come to me; the hunger inside me roared as I sensed his approach. Why wasn\u2019t anyone giving it to me? I\u2019d fucking get it myself. I waited. He drew closer. His breath brushed over me, leaning close. Quickly, I wrapped my legs around him, grabbed his head, and found his throat with my mouth. I held fast, with my teeth and body. Something was wrong, though. There was no rush of blood; no thump-thump as it beat through his body. Weakened, I allowed him to shake me off. I hit the ground, and he landed on top of me. He held me down; at first I thrashed. He allowed me to. Drained as I was, slumber claimed me and pulled me into darkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A cold sweat awakened me, and I bolted up out of my sleep. Vague flashes of horrifying dreams crossed my memory, but not in full. As if I were watching an old reel of film on fast-forward, bits and pieces of scenes broke into my vision. They came so fast, I couldn\u2019t tell if I was even in them. I couldn\u2019t even tell whether they were dreams I was remembering, or reality. My breath came fast, as though I\u2019d been running; yet my heart pumped slowly, sluggishly, almost inhumanly, and I could hear it echo inside my head like a deep, bellowing gong. I glanced down at myself. Only a pair of panties and a tank covered my body. All else was bare. My inked dragons burned, as though literally searing into my skin, my back, my arms, as if they were alive. It was nighttime. The sky was an eerie blue hue, darkness surrounded me, and a slight breeze wafted through the gaping front of my tent. It grazed my skin, and it cooled the burning. I craved ... something. To eat? I wanted it badly, with the same intensity of having the freaking munchies after a toke party. But I didn\u2019t want corn chips and soda. I wanted ... steak\u2014very, very rare steak. I moved to get up but was stopped.</p><p>A strong arm snaked around my middle, and only then did I realize Eli sat behind me on the makeshift quilted bed. We were still on Da Island, I supposed. With his legs on either side of me, he cradled my body and pulled me against him. After a few seconds of trying to figure out where the hell I was and what was happening, I relaxed and rested my head against his chest. The craving was still there, but it eased.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I miss?\u201d I asked, vaguely thinking how odd it was not to feel his heartbeat at my back. Eli Dupr\u00e9 was a creature of the afterlight. He didn\u2019t have a heartbeat. But he did have heart. I snuggled into his warmth\u2014well, as much warmth as a vampire could have, anyway. I snuggled into his lukewarmness.</p> <p>\u201cAbout another week,\u201d he admitted, grasping my hands, pulling them to my waist, and lacing his fingers through mine. \u201cYou had me seriously worried this time, Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d I said, and turned my head to the side, looking up at him. His face was lost in shadows. \u201cThe last I recall, you were kissing me, then ... nothing. And I don\u2019t like having chunks of my life missing. So tell me.\u201d</p><p>Eli let out a deep sigh\u2014funny, since he didn\u2019t need lungs or air to breathe\u2014and tightened his arms around me. \u201cYou did pass out, but not for long. When you came around, you were wild. Bad withdrawals, Riley. Crazy-bad, as in mad-dog, foaming-at-the-mouth, rabies-type withdrawals. I could barely restrain you. You had night sweats, day sweats, chills, and you pretty much tore up Estelle\u2019s camp. That pain caused you to make sounds I\u2019ve never heard a human make before.\u201d He brushed his scruffy jaw against my cheek. \u201cYou were like a newling, having the strigoi blood inside you. It was torturous, Riley, and I never, ever want to hear it come from you again. I felt ... as if it were happening to me.\u201d His lips grazed my skin, and I shuddered at the intimacy. \u201cI felt hopeless. Never again, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember flashes of weird dreams, as if I were attacking someone,\u201d I said, struck by his endearing name for me. It was the first time he\u2019d used it. I stared into the darkness. \u201cJesus, tell me I didn\u2019t attack someone. What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kicked my ass\u2014that\u2019s what else,\u201d he said, and I could feel his grin, his teeth, against the skin of my neck.</p> <p>That should have caused me a little fear\u2014especially since I had flavor-of-the-month-for-vampires blood. But, it didn\u2019t. \u201cStrong as a freaking horse, you are, woman,\u201d he continued. \u201cPhin, Luc, and I had to take you to another island, just to keep the others safe.\u201d</p><p>I turned in his lap and stared in the vicinity of his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s low, soft chuckle filled the night air. \u201cWe had to leave Da Island before you hurt someone else. We\u2019re close by\u2014just another barrier isle. We had to put a little water between you and the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else?\u201d I asked, almost shrieking. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I attacked anybody. Who did I hurt? Are they okay? Oh my God, tell me it wasn\u2019t Estelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said, tugging me backward. \u201cLie still and relax, and stop squirming all over the place. Everyone\u2019s okay, and no, it wasn\u2019t Preacher or Estelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I demanded, but allowed Eli to settle me against him. \u201cI need to know, Eligius. Tell me. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Again, he chuckled, so it must\u2019ve not been that bad. \u201cLet\u2019s just say Zetty won\u2019t cross you again for a while. At least, not without a few more protective charms from Estelle. Neither will Riggs.\u201d He laughed. \u201cJack and Tuba won\u2019t come near you without a blade. And I think the Romanian swear words were enough to damage all of them for life. Nasty language, Riley. Seriously\u2014freaky-filthy.\u201d He nuzzled my neck. \u201cGood thing no one else knows Romanian. I know it, though. At least the curse words. And I like it.\u201d He nipped my skin. \u201cI got the worst of it, though. I guess because I stayed by you.\u201d</p><p>I sat up again and turned toward him. \u201cGod, you\u2019re a perv. Come on. What did I do to you? A two-hundred-year-old wicked-tempered vampire?\u201d</p><p>In one quick move, Eli picked me up and turned my whole body around, then settled me in his lap, face-to-face. \u201cBesides beating the holy hell out of me,\u201d he said, resting his hands on my hips, \u201cyou tried to drain my blood. Not that I have any\u2014but that didn\u2019t stop you.\u201d He rubbed a hand over his throat. \u201cDamn, my neck is still sore.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, mortified. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, and looked at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreaking weird, huh?\u201d Luc suddenly said, ducking into the tent. Phin followed. \u201cYou were like, on vamp crack or something. Went after throats as if there were no tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ri,\u201d Phin said. \u201cWrapping those long legs around your prey. Like some weird spider monkey or something. You\u2019d make one badass strigoi, that\u2019s for sure. Eyes all wide and scary, teeth gnashing.\u201d He shuddered dramatically. \u201cScary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, Underworld badass,\u201d Luc said, then studied me. \u201cPretty hot, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad I didn\u2019t turn on you,\u201d I said, thinking it vaguely funny that they, vampires themselves, thought it was all, well, funny. I narrowed my gaze. \u201cWatch your neck.\u201d</p> <p>Luc laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Phin squatted down and looked at me with a grin. \u201cIf you ever get tired of being with an old man\u201d\u2014he inclined his head to Eli\u2014\u201cyou know where to find me. I dig kick-ass chicks with long legs and tats.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the first to know.\u201d</p><p>I was silent for a moment, then cleared my throat. \u201cOkay, so here we are, on another barrier island, isolated, with unpredictable teeth-gnashing scary me in my freaking panties, straddling your brother. How \u2019bout a little privacy, huh?\u201d I said, then turned to Eli. I couldn\u2019t see his features\u2014just his silhouette; his very beautiful silhouette. \u201cIs it safe yet?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, are you safe yet?\u201d Luc corrected.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know for sure for a while,\u201d Eli said, \u201cbut I think I can handle it. Luc, Phin\u2014get out of here.\u201d Eli\u2019s hands slid around my waist, pulling me closer. Fire shot through me.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Bro\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d I said. It was more of a growl.</p><p>Eli\u2019s brothers laughed and, just as fast as they had appeared, they disappeared into the darkness. I didn\u2019t stare after them; I didn\u2019t wait to see if they\u2019d actually gone. Fact was, I didn\u2019t care. They could stay and watch for all that it mattered. What I wanted\u2014desperately needed\u2014was right in front of me; rather, beneath me. Obsession to take him claimed me.</p><p>I eased down, shoved my fingers through Eli\u2019s hair, and pulled his mouth to mine with more force than I\u2019d meant. The desperation to have him crushed me, frightened me, made me breathless, reckless, and, thank God, his craving matched mine. As if we were starved, our mouths met hungrily, taking whatever was being offered. Eli\u2019s hands eased up my side, palming my breasts through the thin cotton tank I wore. Unsatisfied, I slung his hands away, yanked the thing over my head, and threw it aside. Thankfully, Eli wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt. His hands were on me again, skimming my bare skin, my ribs, my back, caressing my breasts, and I savored his mouth as though tasting an exotic flavor for the very first time. Hot and sweet, our tongues and mouths slid against one another, the slick friction an aphrodisiac that nearly made me lose my mind. I lifted a hand to our melded mouths, slipped a finger between our lips, and felt his tongue tangle with mine. I groaned at the sensation, then felt Eli\u2019s hands skim my spine, cup my buttocks, and pull me hard against him. Again, I groaned.</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me,\u201d I whispered hoarsely, breathless, running my palm over the hard ridges of his abs, lower, groping. I dragged my lips across his neck, to his ear. \u201cUs. One. Now.\u201d</p><p>I quickly found myself hard on my back. A whoosh of air escaped my lungs, and, before I could catch my breath, his nimble fingers had grasped my panties and ripped them right off me. The sound of ragged material cracked the still night air, and the roughness excited me. Filtered moonlight reflected off Eli\u2019s eyes; a dangerous gleam that sent a thrill through my body. I wrapped my legs around his waist, grabbed him by the neck, and pulled his mouth down to mine.</p><p>I don\u2019t know when Eli lost the board shorts he was wearing, but I was damn glad for it. Skin to skin, his just a fraction cooler in temperature than mine, we melded. As he pushed into me, I groaned, dug my heels into his ass, and gasped as he moved, seductive, possessive, wild and out of control.</p><p>A slow, tumultuous orgasm built from somewhere deep within me, growing in strength, making me struggle for breath as it peaked, and crashing over me in shuddering waves until my body shook. I wanted to sink straight into Eli\u2014into his soul. I buried my face in his neck as he wrapped his arms around me; total bodies embraced, limbs entwined, and his shudders rocked me as an orgasm wracked him, too. With his mouth at my ear, his full lips dragging seductively across my skin, he whispered, gasped, spoke unknown words in French, muttered my name, and clung to me as though our lives depended on it. I felt him so deeply, I couldn\u2019t tell where he ended and I began. Eli made me feel more vulnerable than I\u2019d ever care to admit. And it scared the hell out of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without words, Eli pulled me up, cradled me in his arms as he lay back, and together we drifted, content; I couldn\u2019t remember ever having felt so thoroughly absolute. To the feel of his strong fingers dragging softly against my skin, I allowed exhaustion to claim me, and it pulled me under in a swift, shadowy, slumbering wave. I hoped that if this was an isolated moment of lucidity, I\u2019d remember it later. I mean, damn.</p><p>In the dark recesses of my subconscious, I cherished Eli Dupr\u00e9 as though we were spending our very last moment together.</p><p>Three days later ...</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not stopping until you get it right.\u201d</p><p>I glared first at Eli, then at my opponents: Jack and Tuba, two young, healthy, very large Gullah guys\u2014both heavily muscled and bare to the waist. Tuba gave me a closed-mouth smile. Jack\u2019s face remained unreadable. \u201cI am freaking doing it right,\u201d I said, the words coming out between clenched teeth. I bent over at the waist, grasped both knees with my hands, and breathed\u2014hard. We\u2019d been at it for hours. The sun blasted down, not a single cloud in the sky to filter its strength. Sand gnats buzzed around my head. I swatted at them irritably, stomped my feet, then rose and pushed the sweaty bangs that had escaped my ponytail off my face. Maybe I was PMSing. I was irritable as hell and just felt ... bitchy. \u201cHow much more right does it have to be, Eli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlades seized and bodies down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re freaking crazy,\u201d I muttered under my breath.</p><p>He smiled.</p> <p>I swore loudly in Romanian\u2014a nasty habit I\u2019d unwillingly and inadvertently picked up after having been bitten by those two strigoi Arcos assholes. \u201cAre you freaking kidding me, Dupr\u00e9?\u201d I kicked the sand, said a few more choice expletives (one day I\u2019d have to learn what they exactly meant\u2014for now I just knew they were bad, and that made me feel better), then walked toward the surf, hands on hips. The salt water licked my bare feet, the crushed shells and coarse sand abrasive between my toes and against my soles. The low-rise board shorts I wore were navy and black, as was the string bikini top\u2014too damn dark for midday, that was for sure. The material sucked in the sun\u2019s sweltering rays, literally frying my hineisca and boobs. No lie, my ass was on fire. I rushed into the water, dunked under, and emerged. Water rolled off my skin. I may have even seen steam.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to spend the rest of the afternoon whining, or are you going to get it right? They both have their weapons, Riley. You have to do more than jump over them,\u201d Eli said, now standing in the water, arms crossed over his bare chest, and with a look so smug I wanted to throw him into the surf. One dark brow\u2014the one with the silver hoop\u2014lifted. He\u2019d read my thoughts again. \u201cReally?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cCome on, Poe, if you think you can take me.\u201d</p><p>I turned, rushed, dropped to a crouch, shot my leg out, and swept Eli\u2019s ankles, leaving behind an arc of water. Without looking, I knew I\u2019d gotten him; I\u2019d heard the splash and curse as he\u2019d landed. I ran directly at Jack and Tuba, who, for the most part, stood, stunned at what I\u2019d done to Eli. I grabbed Jack\u2019s blade, leapt, pushed off his shoulder with one bare foot, and as I flipped over Tuba, I relieved him of his blade, too. I landed on my hands and feet in a kick-ass, impressive crouchingdragon position\u2014all in under five seconds. I flipped my head cockily, swinging my sopping wet ponytail out of my face, and found Eli\u2019s gaze penetrating mine. We stared for a handful of seconds. A burst of pride filled me at my conquered tendencies. God\u2014I\u2019d felt so ... Matrix-y. And it felt good. Maybe being tainted by strigoi DNA wasn\u2019t so bad after all.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Eli said, still sitting in the water. \u201cYou didn\u2019t take them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d I replied with a grin. \u201cI took you down. That counts for both of them.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Tuba laughed.</p> <p>With lightning speed I kicked out and swept both of their ankles. Two very large Gullah guys hit the sand. Still crouching, I flung their blades hard. Each stuck in the sand no more than an inch from their crotches. They both made a noise that highly resembled a tire with an air leak. I rose, brushed my hands off on my ass, and turned toward Eli. I grinned.</p><p>He stood, sunlight reflecting off his bare wet skin, and swaggered toward me. He bent down to pick up a shell, and I caught a glimpse of the family crest I\u2019d inked between his shoulder blades, just before all hell broke loose. Not only was it sexy schmexy as hell, but his brothers now wanted one, too. I\u2019d created a gang\u2014a vampire gang. How exciting.</p><p>Eli made his way toward me. I was surprised that his shades had stayed on after I\u2019d knocked him down. Wet board shorts clung low on his hips, those sexy lines of muscle on his sides and abdomen that disappeared beneath the waistline; I noticed every detail, appreciating them all. And he knew it. With long fingers, he shoved the loose wet hanks of dark hair from his face, put his hands on his hips in a total cocky-guy manner, and, his shades still on, stared down at me. I waited; I didn\u2019t have to wait long.</p><p>The corner of his mouth tipped upward. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and pushed his shades up onto his forehead. Pale blue eyes regarded me. \u201cTurns you on, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d he answered in a quiet, seductive voice meant only for my ears. In a possessive grasp, he draped his hands over my hips and pulled me close. \u201cBut Jack and Tuba are mere mortals. Estelle could take them, with the right training. I want to see\u201d\u2014he shook his head\u2014\u201cI want to know you can handle yourself against a vampire, or a handful of them, if I\u2019m not around, Riley.\u201d His eyes turned serious. \u201cSo, from now on, you train with me, my parents, my brothers and sister.\u201d He tapped the end of my nose. \u201cAnd maybe with Zetty.\u201d</p><p>With the palms of my hands firmly pressed against the hard muscles of Eli\u2019s chest, I pushed. \u201cIf you think for a second I\u2019m going to seize blades and kick to the ground your sweet, elderly parents, you are insane,\u201d I said. \u201cYour siblings, sure. Zetty? Absolutely. I owe him, anyway. You? Any day of the week. But your parents? No way.\u201d</p><p>Eli grazed my jaw with a knuckle. \u201cOh, you will, ch\u00e9rie . I promise you. You\u2019re ready. And tomorrow, we go back to Da Island.\u201d He grinned, making himself seem more like just a regular hot guy at the beach than a nearly two-hundred-year-old strigoi vampire who had the capability of snapping someone\u2019s spine in half with barely a flick of his wrist. \u201cAnd I\u2019d pay good money to see you call my parents elderly to their faces. Neo.\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t help but return the cocky grin at Eli\u2019s reference to my new Matrix-y capabilities. I had no idea what I\u2019d ever do with them, but one thing I did know. Seth and I, while changed with supertendencies, couldn\u2019t stay on Da Island forever. I had a business to run. Seth had to finish school. We had lives to return to\u2014and the sooner, in my opinion, the better, even if it did mean kicking some old, sweet-looking Dupr\u00e9 strigoi vampire ass.</p><p>A few days later ...</p><p>It\u2019s strange to think of all that\u2019s happened over the past month; to grasp how much I\u2019ve changed. Stranger still, that I\u2019ve accepted it. I\u2019m not a huge fan of change. Once I\u2019m used to something, I like to stick with it. Not that I had any choice. I was damn lucky to leave Bonaventure that night with my life, instead of a new unlife. Seriously. Having both Arcoses sink their fangs into my flesh, squirt their disgusting venom into my blood, and still walk away alive? Eli had saved me; he\u2019d killed Valerian, and nearly Victorian, as well. Preacher told Eli that half a minute longer and I would have either died from blood loss or turned completely strigoi, neither of which I had a hankering for. The screams of those innocents who\u2019d been attacked that night still resound inside my head. Visions; flashes of bodies twisted, distorted; blood; the sound of bone snapping\u2014I wish like hell I could forget about it, forget the sound, forget them. But I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I ever will. I\u2019ll hear those screams inside my head until I die. And now even that would be a very long time.</p><p>So much of what happened after Bonaventure is still a blur. You know, after I was two bites to the wind and lying in a pile of graveyard dust. Once I\u2019d been taken to Da Island (and after I\u2019d briefly awakened), I fell into the throes of strigoi venom d.t.\u2019s for much of the time and was, according to Estelle, one crazy-eyed white girl. She wasn\u2019t referring to my Caucasian race. Eli had told me I\u2019d turned white, as in literally opaque white. Weird white. Night of the Living Dead white. Zetty\u2019s exact words, in his unique Nepal accent, had been You was one scary crazy white bitch. I believe them, too. Ole Zetty, to be such a big, frightening, knife-wielding Tibetan, was as superstitious as they came, and he gladly carried the pouch of graveyard dust and crushed black cat bones Estelle had given him. He even wore it around his big thick neck, tied to a leather cord. I guess he thought throwing the mixture at me, pouch and all, would keep him safe. He\u2019d done it more than once, after I\u2019d attacked him. Estelle had told him she wouldn\u2019t give him any more if he couldn\u2019t use it right. I still laugh when I think about it. Can\u2019t say I blame him, though. I\u2019d have been scared shitless, too.</p><p>A breeze blew in off the water, rustled the canvas of our tent, and brushed over my bare body. I turned to stare outside, into the varying shades of gray and black as darkness hung over the small barrier isle, and Eli\u2019s arms tightened around me and pulled me close. I knew he wasn\u2019t asleep; he pretended, though, just for me I guess. There were times I just lay awake, my thoughts rambling around in my head, and Eli simply let me. No interference, no smothering\u2014just let me have my thoughts, allowed me to ponder the changes in my life, my brother\u2019s, without interruption. He was there if I needed him, or if I grew frightened, and I have to admit it was something I could get used to real fast. After Mom\u2019s death, I\u2019d always had Preacher and Estelle, but never had I allowed a man inside my heart, and I damn sure never depended on one to comfort me. I can\u2019t say for sure that I\u2019ve let Eli; but it was definitely worth considering. Commitment of one\u2019s heart and soul\u2014literally\u2014required a lot of deep thought. The problem was I\u2019d had so much to think about and consider lately that my brain was on total overload, and, to be frank, I was a little intimidated to commit myself to a man who would most definitely outlive me. Sure\u2014it\u2019d take a lot longer, now that I had tendencies. Still, it was a lot to ponder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sounds of the tide\u2019s ebb and flow blended with the bubbling oyster shoals close by, and the crackle of palm fronds split the night air as the storm that had been threatening since midnight picked up strength. No rain\u2014just wind, thunder, and streaky lightning that occasionally flashed the dark sky. I lay in the semiwarmth of a vampire\u2019s embrace, his hard, perfectly shaped body wrapped possessively around mine, and I couldn\u2019t think of any other place I\u2019d rather be right now. Sharp, salty air assaulted my senses; a scent I loved and drew fully into my lungs. I picked up another scent\u2014faint, farther away, and I smiled as I recognized Preacher\u2019s tobacco. It was weird how one of my vampiric tendencies was a caninelike sense of smell. Gilles had said it was because somewhere along the Arcos vampire family tree a loup-garou had come into play. So I not only had strigoi venom floating around inside me and permanently attaching itself to my friggin\u2019 DNA, but werewolf slobber, too. I hoped to God I didn\u2019t start lifting my leg and peeing on bushes, or worse\u2014humping legs. Christ Almighty damn.</p><p>The pipe tobacco drifted to my senses again, and I smiled. No doubt Preacher had sneaked outside to smoke, out of reach of his wife\u2019s broomstick. Estelle would whack him for sure if she caught him. Root doctor, conjurer, or not\u2014Preacher was still susceptible to mortal diseases. I thought so, anyway.</p><p>See? My thoughts rambled from vampire venom to Gullah tobacco smoke to wives smacking husbands with broomsticks to werewolves humping legs to cancer, all in the matter of minutes. I was brain fried. Or, I suppose, some would call it Southern fried. Whatever that meant.</p> <p>I needed a walk, a breath of storm-salty air\u2014a good lung-burning run\u2014to clear my thoughts. I shifted, eased off the quilts, but Eli\u2019s strong arm stopped me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, nuzzling my neck with his scruffy chin. \u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>I turned my head and pressed my lips against the strong, corded column of his throat. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t, faker. I just want to go for a run along the beach.\u201d I slid my palm along his bare hip, then over his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few, okay?\u201d</p><p>Eli groaned\u2014a sexually frustrated noise that stirred my insides. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cYou\u2019re a prince. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I rolled off the quilts, blindly grabbed the short cotton dress I wore over my swimsuit, and pulled it over my head and bare body.</p> <p>\u201cThought you weren\u2019t modest,\u201d Eli said. \u201cNo one on this island but us. You could run naked.\u201d</p><p>At the tent\u2019s open doorway, I turned and looked at him. Arm bent, head propped on the heel of his hand, Eli watched me like a hungry wolf. I grinned. \u201cI trust your brothers about as much as I trust Riggs. They\u2019re all pervs. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s laughter followed me out into the night.</p><p>I ran, and I ran hard\u2014no warm-up jog, no stretching\u2014I didn\u2019t need a warm-up; just a full-out, haul-ass run from the moment I stepped out of the tent. Sand and shell bits, and probably an unfortunate fiddler or ghost crab or two crunched beneath my bare feet as I tore up the shoreline, and the faster I ran, the more invigorated I felt. It took a lot for my lungs to burn any more, so I ran on as if I could literally run forever, fast, furious, my thighs and calves pumping, my arms swinging fiercely. It was ... freeing\u2014well, almost freeing. My mind still ran rampant, and my heart, well ... It still chugged sluggishly along, in complete contrast with my body\u2019s motion. I\u2019m not sure it would ever pump fast again. Weird. I felt adrenaline, but you\u2019d never have known it with my body\u2019s response. Preacher and Gilles said it was the strigoi venom\u2014a side effect that would never leave me; just one of many, so they said. I\u2019m still discovering them. Right now? I didn\u2019t feel like attacking anyone. I didn\u2019t seem to have a craving digging at me from the inside out. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was because I was on this barrier isle alone, with just Eli, or if it meant I finally had run the d.t.\u2019s course. Still, the discovery of each and every strange tendency was sort of like opening presents at Christmas. There was always something you didn\u2019t expect. Sort of like how I was involved with a family of guardian vampires whose own DNA had been altered by centuries of hoodoo herbs and magic; it still boggled my brain to see Eli out in the sun, in the middle of the day, looking like the rest of the world. Well, minus the fact that he was painfully beautiful. You know what I mean, though\u2014Hollywood\u2019s concept of vampire\u2019s doesn\u2019t quite cover what\u2019s really out there. I hadn\u2019t once seen Eli rise slowly from a coffin, or even wear a black cape with a red lining. My vampire needed only a good nap during the day to function. His skin didn\u2019t catch on fire in the sunlight and he not only ate food, but peed\u2014if he drank a lot of beer. Weird.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how big the barrier island was that we were on, but I ran around it three times before I stopped. I walked into the surf, the water lukewarm as it lapped at my thighs, and I stared out across the darkness, toward the open sound. There was the tiniest sliver of moon; everything was in shadows except the white, bleached-out sand. Heat lightning (I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the scientific term for it, but it\u2019s what Seth and I called it growing up) followed the rumbling thunder and snaked across the black sky in thin silver web threads, and it would throw just enough of a surreal glow over the area to let me know what was out there, beyond the sand, water, palms. Inside my head, my mind whirled.</p><p>Victorian Arcos concerned me. I hadn\u2019t heard his voice in my head since that one time, when I\u2019d first awakened on Da Island after being rescued from Bonaventure. I\u2019d not mentioned it to anyone\u2014not even to Eli. Just knowing Victorian was alive and free scared me. I wasn\u2019t scared of him\u2014not physically, anyway. Not anymore. It was a different type of fear; maybe even fear of myself, and my response to him. I didn\u2019t even like to think of it, or him. Unavoidably, I did. He was obsessed with me, and his last words to me were a solid promise to come for me. He might not be in the vicinity, but he was still here. I could feel him. And that freaked me out. He possessed a mind control over me in the dreams that made me respond to him in a way that I loathed. Swear to God, I couldn\u2019t help myself. And one thing I hated was not being in control of my actions and thoughts.</p> <p>As I dug my toes into the wet sand, I thought of everyone else in my life, and how my changes would affect them. Nyx was beside herself with worry, for me and Seth. As far as she knew, I was fine; it was Seth who\u2019d needed me, after his supposed drug addiction. It was the only thing we could tell her. Seth hated it because he was so adamant about never being on drugs; we\u2019d had no choice. I\u2019d left Inksomnia in Nyx\u2019s very capable hands while Seth and I both spent time recovering. I hated lying to her; she was my best friend. But no way in hell could she ever handle the truth. And even if she did ever dare to believe in vampires, I could almost imagine her running around, hugging them all and thinking a little love would cure their barbaric sickness. If anyone could hug a vampire into being nice, it\u2019d be Master Hugger Nyxinnia Foster. But I trusted only the Dupr\u00e9s in regard to creatures of the afterlight, and receiving Nyx\u2019s hugs. God, I missed her. She missed us, too, and wanted us home. Hopefully, that\u2019d be soon. I suppose since I hadn\u2019t tried to suck anyone else\u2019s blood out that my withdrawals had finally come to an end. Thank God. I was freaking sick of all the ups and downs. It was like going through the midlife change, only with vampirism.</p><p>Strong arms encircled my waist, breaking my rambling thoughts, and, unlike my old, prevampiric-tendencied self, I didn\u2019t even flinch.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so why is that?\u201d Eli said, his lips close to my ear. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you flinch?\u201d</p><p>I rested my weight against him. \u201cBecause, you nerd,\u201d I said teasingly, \u201cnot only can I smell your scent two miles away, but I can hear you coming. I also heard you lay that quilt on the sand over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, his voice low, seductive, one hand leaving my waist to skim over my hip. \u201cHearing me come is quite a unique vampiric tendency.\u201d Slowly, erotically, he slipped his hand lower, beneath the hem of my short cotton beach dress, and dragged his palm up my hip. His body tightened behind me, and he buried his mouth into the crook of my neck. \u201cChrist, Riley,\u201d he said, his hand skimming my bare skin, his voice deepening. \u201cRunning commando these days?\u201d Both hands found their way beneath my dress, and my head fell against Eli\u2019s chest as the sensation of his palms gliding over first my thighs, hips, abdomen, then lower, came over me. He pulled me against him, held me tightly, and his hardness throbbed, pressing into my lower back. Vampires had to be, hands down, the horniest creatures of any light. Fine by me. As his mouth moved over the sensitive skin of my neck, then my ear, I lifted my hands, grasped his jaw, and threaded my fingers through his hair. The soft, wet brush of his lips caressing my skin turned me on almost as much as his palm cupping my bare, pantiless bottom. Aching for him, I squirmed a bit against his hand so that the sensitive nub would touch the right callused spot, and sensations raced through me as I succeeded. Before I came, he pulled away, lifted my dress over my head, flung it somewhere behind us, then turned me in his arms, and lowered his head until his mouth covered mine. With both hands holding my head in place, he kissed me, tasted my tongue with his, and slowly, he began walking me backward, deeper into the water. We stopped moving when it reached our waist, and although I couldn\u2019t see Eli\u2019s face in detail, I saw the silhouette. He watched me, silent, his hands moving softly over my jaw, chin, cheekbones, grazing my lips. The heat lightning overhead crept across the sky like the fine strands of a spiderweb, and, in the brief second it flashed, I saw Eli\u2019s eyes. They were fixed on me, dark, filled with a craving that caused me to shiver with eagerness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted another as much as I want you,\u201d he mouthed against my lips before tasting them. \u201cI\u2019ve waited for you my whole existence, and I never thought for a second that I\u2019d get so lucky.\u201d He kissed me, his full lips dragging over mine, our tongues brushing. His hands grasped my hips; his fingers dug into my flesh, I gasped, and he lifted me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wrapped my legs around him, the water making our bodies slick, and I slid down his abdomen until his rigid hardness nudged me, entered me, completely filled me. His hands splayed over my buttocks, pulling me tightly against him, preventing all thoughts of escape, and he kissed me again. Hard. Demanding. Possessive. I nearly came again.</p><p>Without any more words, Eli moved through the water, back to the shore. At the quilt he\u2019d laid on the sand, he followed me down and kissed me as slowly as he made love to me. The only time I could see him was when the lightning flashed, and even then for only a split second or two. But I felt him, inside me, surrounding me, and I knew then that making love with Eli was unlike any other experience I\u2019d ever had, or would ever have. He reached a place so deep and hidden within me, that it frightened me, and I wasn\u2019t prepared to name it yet. I clung to him as we climaxed together, beneath an almost-moonless September night in the sand on a random Gullah barrier island. When our movement slowed, Eli\u2019s hands searched first my body, then my face, and he held me close, pressing his lips to my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine forever, ch\u00e9rie,\u201d he said, his accent thicker than usual. \u201cI want only you.\u201d</p> <p>Before I could respond, his lips claimed mine, settled, tasted slowly. With his knuckles he grazed my jaw, traced my lips, then wrapped his arms and legs around me, pulling me close. I accepted the fact that while Eli had the courage to say the words out loud, I didn\u2019t. But I felt them just as strongly as I\u2019d felt anything. One day, hopefully, I\u2019d be able to tell him. Nestled against his chest, I hugged him and closed my eyes.</p><p>He kissed me again, whispered something French in my ear\u2014I had no clue what it meant. I figured he\u2019d just read my endearing thoughts and that my unspoken words were enough for him right now. Finally, exhaustion claimed me.</p><p>I confess, love\u2014it pains me to know you\u2019ve had another inside you. That you seem to enjoy it so fully excites me, though, and as I promised, one day you shall be no longer his, but mine. You will have me inside you over and over until you beg me to stop; and after, you\u2019ll never want another. There is no escape\u2014you are meant for me. He may be inside you for a while\u2014as long as it takes him to fuck you\u2014but I live inside you. My blood is mixed with yours, and no amount of hoodoo magic can change it. We are one and I promise, I will come for you. Until then, I drown in thoughts of you, of touching you, of your mouth sliding over me. Soon, love. Very soon ...</p><p>I bolted up from the quilts and gasped. I glanced around; I was alone. A hazy light filled the canvas tent, the sun not yet risen but still light enough outside to see. The pungent brine of low tide wafted through and rustled my hair, and I inhaled deeply. Oh Christ Almighty. Another dream.</p><p>Another message, rather. From Victorian. He was close. I could feel him.</p> <p>\u201cEli?\u201d I called out, and crawled on hands and knees to the tent opening.</p><p>The man I sometimes had a difficult time remembering was a vampire sat hunched down at the shore, watching the sun rise and picking at some random shell in the sand. The slightly tanned skin of his muscular back looked shiny in the peaking sunlight, the black-inked Dupr\u00e9 crest standing stark between his blades. He was buck naked. He turned and waved. \u201cCome here, you,\u201d he said, and gave me a grin.</p><p>Pushing the fear of Victorian aside, I, also buck naked, left the tent and joined him at the water\u2019s edge. And as he took me in his arms, I flushed my mind of the other. He\u2019d not ruin this. I simply wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>And I\u2019d die making sure of it.</p><p>Part Two</p><p>VOICES</p> <p>\u201cThere are such beings as vampires, some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for some people.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Bram Stoker, Dracula</p><p>\u201cSwear to God, I thought I could handle this. Truly. I mean, the power of my tendencies is freaking amazing. I can do some outlandish shit. Even Gilles is impressed. But in becoming fearless, I\u2019ve become reckless, and that\u2019s not so good. While Victorian looks deceiving\u2014I mean, he\u2019s absolutely beautiful\u2014I know the depth of his desires. He freaking tells me all the time\u2014inside my head. He wants me as badly as Eli does, and I\u2019m scared it\u2019s going to come down to an all-out war. The thing is, what am I willing to risk to stop it?\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>My back hit the sand as I dropped to the ground, avoiding the blade Eli\u2019s mother had freaking flung at me. Before I could blink, Elise was over me, her tiny bare foot to my throat. As my eyes met hers, she shook her head and sighed.</p><p>\u201cRiley, sweetheart,\u201d Elise said, her voice even, sweet, her heavier French accent enticing. \u201cNever drop to your back. Crouch, oui. Jump, oui. But as you can see, being on your back leaves you vulnerable.\u201d She wiggled her toes against the sensitive part of my throat, then removed her foot and extended a hand to me. I took it and, with amazing strength, she helped me up. \u201cIn any situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said, mortified that a very proper lady in her late fifties with delicately painted pink toes and weighing no more than a hundred and ten pounds could kick my ass. I brushed the sand off my skin. \u201cCrouch. Don\u2019t drop.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOne hundred and four pounds,\u201d she clarified, reading my thoughts as the Dupr\u00e9s frequently and freely did. \u201cSeth,\u201d she called out.</p> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he replied, leaving the gathered group, including all of the Dupr\u00e9 siblings, by the surf and running up to us.</p><p>\u201cJoin your sister.\u201d</p><p>Seth glanced at me and wagged his dark brows. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>I scowled at him. Suck up, I mouthed. He merely grinned.</p><p>Elise, dressed in a pair of knee-length white Bermuda shorts, a pale pink tank top to match her toes, and her hair pulled back into her signature stylish ponytail, studied us. The late-afternoon sunlight winked off the various rubber practice blades (we didn\u2019t want to get stuck) sheathed around her slim waist, her thighs, and over both shoulders. She looked too petite to have the ability to carry such a load, but I knew she had the strength to toss me two hundred feet into the sound if she wanted. She was wicked strong, wicked fast, and wicked lethal, despite her sweet looks.</p><p>\u201cPhin, Luc,\u201d she called, grinning at me. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes met Eli\u2019s briefly as his brothers jogged across the sand. He offered no smile, no cocky grin\u2014only that profuse stare that seemed to pierce my insides, clear to my soul. It made me shiver.</p><p>Phin and Luc circled Seth and me, as Elise barely seemed to shift in the sand. Their eyes bored heavily into us, like hunters stalking prey. The boys were just as armed as their mother, and this was nothing more than a test of reflexes. Seth and I had no blades\u2014just our wits and superfast tendencies. Hopefully, they were superfast enough; neither of us wanted to get nailed on the noggin with a rubber blade. With our backs pressed together, Seth turned his head.</p><p>\u201cNo dropping,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI got Phin and Mrs. Dupr\u00e9. You take Luc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now they know our master plan,\u201d I hissed. \u201cClear your mind, Bro. They freaking cheat.\u201d</p><p>All the Dupr\u00e9s on the beach laughed, and in the next breath, Phin and Luc lunged.</p><p>Seth leapt; I crouched. After that, I could keep track only of what I did and hoped my brother could handle himself. Luc got too close; I relieved him of three lower body blades before he realized it. I heard the whir of another rubber blade through the air and I turned, gauged the weight and distance of the sound, then raised my hand and caught the blade Elise had thrown by the hilt. Three more followed, rapid-fire, and with a speed that amazed even me, I caught each one and flung it into the sand before the next one reached me. Luc lunged again. I leapt over him, grabbed the blade sheathed at his shoulder, and landed in the sand behind him. A dull pain in my thigh made me drop. Luc had thrown the one remaining blade at his hip at me. Prick. I winced, and he grinned. Good thing I healed fast these days. Whatever bruise appeared would be gone within an hour. And because of my mixed Arcos blood, my own wasn\u2019t quite as potent as it was before. In other words, the Dupr\u00e9s didn\u2019t continuously want to latch on to a major artery as much as before. Lucky me. I turned to watch my brother.</p><p>Seth jumped over Phin and had both his shouldered blades flung into the sand. Phin already had the rest of his blades removed. Seth landed, swept Phin\u2019s shins with blinding speed, and had those blades out of their sheaths, too. I blinked, and by the time my eyes focused again on my brother, he was circling Elise. The intense look of concentration, determination, and intimidation on his face was more than shocking. Seth was a guy raised to respect not only his elders, but all women. Presently, he looked as though he wanted to take down little Elise Dupr\u00e9 in her pressed white Bermudas and pink toenails.</p><p>By now, the crowd gathered at the surf had come closer, and the boys who had once been almost-newlings cheered and whistled as Seth and Elise circled each other. Jack and Tuba, Zetty, Estelle and Preacher, as well as Eli, Gilles, and Josie, drew close. Elise still had two blades\u2014one on her hip, the other on her shoulder. With wicked speed, she whipped the hip blade at my brother. He crouched, reached up, and grabbed it, in midair. The boys hollered.</p><p>In the next instant, Elise threw the last blade, and this time, Seth wasn\u2019t as lucky. It nailed his shoulder, and I winced as he did. Then, so fast, swear to God, he lunged at Elise, grabbed the blade before it landed on the ground, and hit her full force, taking her to the sand and flat onto her back. He had the blade in his hand, the tip at her throat.</p><p>Wow. Freaking, wow.</p><p>The Lord of the Flies boys cheered, and I glanced at Eli. He gave an approving nod. I couldn\u2019t see his eyes\u2014they were covered by his shades\u2014but I\u2019d be willing to bet they shined with pride for my brother.</p><p>\u201cHey, punk,\u201d Luc said, pulling my thoughts back. \u201cGet your ass off my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mrs. Dupr\u00e9,\u201d Seth said, jumping off Elise and extending a hand to help her up. She took it, and his cheeks turned red. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell done, sweetheart,\u201d she said, brushing off her sandy backside. She put a hand on his bare shoulder. \u201cYou sincerely impress me.\u201d</p><p>Phin propped an elbow on top of my shoulder and leaned close. \u201cYour brother has serious gifts,\u201d he said. \u201cNot many can best my mother.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s his extreme Southern mannerisms that make him so deceiving. I bet Elise wouldn\u2019t allow it to happen again.\u201d</p> <p>Phin grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d He glanced down at my thigh. \u201cHow\u2019s the leg?\u201d</p><p>I followed his gaze to the place where Luc\u2019s blade had hit my thigh. I shrugged it off. \u201cBarely hurts at all.\u201d The red splotch had started to turn purple. It wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><p>Had I been there, I\u2019d never have allowed that blade, rubber or not, to reach your beautiful body.</p><p>I jerked my head around. So profound was Victorian\u2019s voice, it\u2019d sounded as though he was standing right beside me. He, of course, wasn\u2019t. I\u2019d known from his last message that he\u2019d be back. I pushed my thoughts, and his voice, out of my head\u2014for now, anyway. My eyes cast around the gathering. No one looked concerned. No one but I heard the voice inside my head. I wondered why Eli couldn\u2019t. He and the other Dupr\u00e9s could read my thoughts. How was it they couldn\u2019t hear Victorian?</p><p>Because, love. It is I injecting your mind with my thoughts. They\u2019re mine alone, meant only for you. See the power I possess?</p> <p>\u201cGo for a walk with me?\u201d Eli said, suddenly behind me, his arms snaking around my waist. He pulled me close. \u201cI\u2019m a little tired of sharing you with the whole Dupr\u00e9 family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome would call that stingy,\u201d Phin said.</p><p>Eli led me away. \u201cI\u2019ve been called worse.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder as we walked, shrugging off Victorian\u2019s voice in my head. My vision caught my brother. Seth waved. \u201cSee ya, Ri.\u201d I smiled back. \u201cLater, Bro.\u201d I\u2019d been a little clingy with him, once I\u2019d awakened this last time. The impact of what could have truly happened to Seth hit me hard, and I was petrified that I\u2019d lose him. Estelle had been the one to tell me to back off a bit, and with only a little resistance, I had. God, I just loved him so much. The pain and fear I\u2019d gone through when the Arcos brothers had taken him almost did me in. I\u2019d worried until I was sick from it. Damn, I couldn\u2019t help it. He was my brother. But I\u2019d chillaxed a bit since, and I trusted him. I mean, Jesus. He could fight like something out of a movie. It was amazing to watch.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make me interact with you through your thoughts,\u201d Eli said, his mouth brushing my ear, \u201cor what?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him.</p> <p>\u201cSupper in thirty minutes, da both of you,\u201d Estelle called after us. I glanced over my shoulder at her and the setting sun gleamed off her flawless dark skin. \u201cI mean dat, girl.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I answered, and threw her a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, you\u2019d better. Naughty child,\u201d she answered, then turned and headed up the beach with the rest.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I can do to you in thirty minutes?\u201d Eli whispered against the skin of my throat as we walked. His hands caressed the bare skin of my exposed stomach, grazed my belly button, slipped below the waist of my board shorts, then skimmed upward and gently tugged at the string tie holding my bikini top together. His lips moved down my neck and over my shoulder, and I shivered.</p><p>\u201cAll talk and no action, Dupr\u00e9?\u201d Completely turned on and burning at his touch, I egged him on, bending my head to the side as Eli\u2019s mouth moved against my skin. I grabbed his ass. \u201cGod, do you seriously need thirty minutes\u2014\u201d</p><p>So fast, my head spun, Eli whipped me around to face him. The waning afternoon sun behind him, he looked down at me, a small shift in breeze rustling his tousled hair. Blue eyes, dark with desire, stared so hard at me, I thought he would devour me, right there. \u201cTrust me,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cI want to.\u201d He slipped his hands over my waist, my buttocks, and pulled me against him. He was already hard, and he throbbed against me, the seam of my board shorts grazing just the right spot. I gasped. \u201cCome.\u201d He grabbed my hand and pulled.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d I promised, allowing Eli to drag me fast up the beach, putting distance between us and the others. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>There really was nowhere else for us to go but the water; the small barrier island was void of most maritime forest, and what little of it there was housed Preacher and Estelle, and the rest of the camp. That left either the wide-open beach, or the water.</p> <p>Eli read my thoughts; he pulled me into the warm surf, let my hand loose, and dove under. I did the same, and we both broke the surface. Eli glided to me, gathered me, and lifted my hips, pulling me onto his lap. Beneath the water, his fingers kneaded my lower back, and I draped my arms around his neck. For several seconds, we simply stared, the rising tide lapping at our skin, and he studied me with such intensity, I nearly looked away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, grasping my jaw to make sure my gaze remained on his. \u201cLook at me, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I did, and my heart skipped a beat. It was almost a painful act to accomplish, fully looking upon him. Eli\u2019s beauty was so great; it literally stunned me every time my eyes raked over his features and his body. With his hair wet and sideswept, and water glistening off his lean frame, my breath involuntarily hitched.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said so softly, I barely heard him. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do to me, too.\u201d He tucked a loose wet strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cI can\u2019t get you off my mind. Ever. You\u2019re all I think about.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a horny vampire. I get it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied fast. \u201cIt\u2019s not that. Well, not only that,\u201d he said. Then, those surreal blue eyes locked tightly on to mine, and I couldn\u2019t have looked away if I\u2019d wanted to.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that whole danger aspect, right?\u201d I asked, trying for some reason not to be serious. \u201cYou know\u2014you have to be extra careful with me because I\u2019m still human and you can\u2019t let yourself fully go\u2014\u201d His fingers over my mouth hushed any more ridiculous words I might have spewed.</p><p>\u201cNo, Riley,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of sex, with a lot of willing partners,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cBut none of them reached me here.\u201d He drew my hand from around his shoulders to rest against his heart\u2014rather, the area where it should have been. His gaze grew darker, more intense. \u201cNot one. Only you. Nothing, or no one, will ever hurt you again, I promise.\u201d His knuckles grazed my jaw. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be alone forever. Now, I have you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s like a miracle or something.\u201d</p><p>My heart leapt. No one has ever made me feel the way Eli does. I know that our relationship is way more than based on just sex. Way more. This is probably why I joke around and try to make light of the serious stuff. I admit\u2014I\u2019m scared. Of what exactly, I\u2019m not sure yet. What I do know is that I feel the same way toward Eli as he does toward me. As corny and obsessed as it sounds, I can\u2019t stand to be away from him for long. I want him close all the time.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d he said, pulling me closer, his smile wide. Then he moved his mouth to my ear. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d hoped to hear,\u201d he whispered, then kissed my lobe. \u201cPart of me never wants to leave here.\u201d He pulled back, meeting my gaze with one that was hooded, filled with a hunger that I\u2019d never, ever seen in the eyes of a human male. It was ... different. I can\u2019t explain it other than it made you feel wanted. Desired. Craved. Not just like ... an object of sex for the moment, but more like ... like a necessity.</p><p>Eli shook his head, moved his hand to the back of my neck, and lowered his mouth to mine. The sun had dropped now, and the breeze hitting my wet skin felt a bit cooler. But with Eli wrapped around me, I hardly noticed or cared. His lips grazed mine, his tongue slowly caressed, and I lost myself in his powerful, seductive kiss. And just as I lowered my hand, pressed against his chest, and trailed my fingers over the ridges of his stomach, he stopped and raised his head.</p><p>A smile\u2014pained though it might be\u2014tipped his sexy mouth. \u201cAnd to prove I\u2019m not just some horny vampire who only wants in your pants, we\u2019re heading back to camp. Now.\u201d</p><p>With a lot less grace than I\u2019d imagined, Eligius Dupr\u00e9 dumped me right into the Atlantic and walked back to the beach.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I said, sitting in the water. \u201cIt\u2019s totally cool if you only want in my pants!\u201d</p><p>Eli laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I slapped the water and swore something filthy-nasty in Romanian. After Eli turned and stared at me in shock, he laughed again, so loudly it resounded off the palms of Da Island. I ducked underwater to cool my heated, raging, hormones.</p><p>Sitting around a roaring campfire on a Georgia barrier island at night with a handful of centuries-old vampires, Gullah conjurers, and adolescent boys with vampiric tendencies made for a way more interesting crowd than any other I\u2019d ever hung with in my wild teenage years, or in my adult years, truth be known. No lie\u2014it was surreal. Bizarre. Oh, and Zetty\u2014can\u2019t forget the big Tibetan. The fact that he sat across from me with a pouch of ground-up black cat bone (I pray the poor thing was dead before its bones were harvested, but I have my doubts), graveyard dust, and God knows what else Estelle mixed up made me want to write to Zetty\u2019s mother in Kathmandu and tell on him. He was one seriously superstitious dude who no longer trusted me, and it\u2019d probably be a long time before he did. I\u2019d really freaked him out when I was detoxing on the vampire venom.</p><p>I looked around at my other fireside companions. Of course, the Dupr\u00e9s were their same charming, French selves. Phin and Luc sat in conversation, and Luc was peeling a piece of saw grass and throwing little slivers of it into the sand as they spoke. Strangely enough, they both looked serious, and it made me wonder what they were talking about. Gilles and Elise, next to them, were totally into each other, which I found pretty cool, given the number of years they\u2019d been together. Gilles held Elise\u2019s hand, and her eyes lit up when looking at him. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s one of a vampire\u2019s greatest perks: When they love you, they really love you\u2014obsessively, faithfully, and forever. I liked it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Josie sat next to Seth; their heads bent together in conversation. Every handful of seconds, one or the other\u2014or both\u2014would laugh at some private joke they were sharing. They\u2019d grown pretty close since the night the humans had been saved and brought to Da Island, and as long as she kept her fangs out of my brother\u2019s arteries, I was totally cool with all that.</p><p>The Lord of the Flies gang, all wearing T-shirts and board shorts, sat huddled together, their bare feet dug into the sand. Riggs had a stick that he kept jabbing into the fire, sending a spray of red sparks flying above their heads. Having\u2019 caught my eye twice already, he raised one eyebrow and grinned. I shook my head. Just what a juvenile guy needed\u2014the sensual tendency of a vampire. He\u2019d been bad enough when he was just plain teenage pubescent Riggs. Now? Good God. I couldn\u2019t help but like the kid, though. I\u2019d watched him spar with a boy named Jacoby\u2014both about the same size, same height. Riggs was fast, and he moved with such grace, he\u2019d seemed to be floating. Like Seth, he\u2019d matured physically, and he was damn fast. Mentally, as well\u2014to a certain extent. I\u2019d witnessed his intense concentration while he was sparring. Gone was the awkward gangliness of a fifteen-year-old. I was seriously impressed. I felt sorry for all parents of young available girls in Savannah.</p><p>Estelle and Preacher sat on one side of me, Jack and Tuba on the other side of them. Every once in a while Tuba would slip me a glance, then grin, his wide white smile seemingly glowing in the dark.</p> <p>Gilles cleared his throat, and we all turned our heads toward him. The firelight played against the age lines grooved into his face by life, prior to becoming a vampire. His eyes, that same shocking Dupr\u00e9 blue, looked like glass as the amber light from the flames reflected in their depths. He glanced around. \u201cYou\u2019ve all done well and have worked hard at honing your new skills. I remember, way back when, after I\u2019d gained my own talents. Not an easy accomplishment.\u201d He gave a short nod. \u201cI am proud.\u201d</p><p>A low murmur ran through the boys, pride evident on their faces.</p><p>\u201cAs you have acquired vampiric tendencies, there are things we will expect of you. You are all custodians of the city.\u201d Gilles\u2019 gaze searched the group of boys, and he smiled. \u201cNon. That does not mean you must clean up, although if the notion strikes you, it would be an admirable thing to do.\u201d</p><p>The crowd chuckled, and Gilles continued.</p><p>\u201cThat means you are now like us\u2014guardians. And things will be expected of you as such. You will watch over the city and keep the humans safe. If you use your tendencies against the humans, you will first be brought to trial, here. With Preacher and his dark ones.\u201d</p> <p>The boys all looked around.</p><p>\u201cAnd if they deem it necessary, we will relinquish your skills from you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Understanding lit the boys\u2019 eyes but fear quickly replaced it. That meant the Dupr\u00e9s would have no choice but to kill them. I prayed it never came to that.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Gilles continued, \u201cwe leave here in two days. You\u2019ll return to your homes, to school, and you will set examples for others your age.\u201d The smile he gave did two things: It warmed and chilled at the same time. Weird. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching.\u201d</p><p>The boys got up and headed to their tents. Their silence meant they were thinking about all that\u2014hard. Good. They needed to. I didn\u2019t want to have to make any more trips to the police station to bail their asses out for doing stupid stuff.</p><p>\u201cGilles, stop,\u201d said Elise softly, playfully smacking Gilles on his thigh. He wore a pair of plaid Bermuda shorts and a white Da Plat Eye T-shirt and flip-flops. He cracked my ass up. Gilles rose, pulling his wife up with him. He eyed me, grinned, then turned back to the small crowd. \u201cYou boys will no longer require as much sleep as before. Don\u2019t sit around idly. Read. Study. Make your mind sharp. Play sports.\u201d He thought for a moment. \u201cI always fancied football. Rather, soccer.\u201d With a nod, he pulled his wife along. \u201cAdieu.\u201d</p> <p>The rest of the crowd dispersed. Preacher leaned over and patted my head. \u201cYou be good, child,\u201d he said, his satiny skin shining in the firelight. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your tea.\u201d He grinned, Estelle giggled, and they disappeared toward the tents.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna go for a walk,\u201d Seth said, Josie at his side. \u201cSee ya in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d I said, and followed them with my eyes until the shadows swallowed them. Eli and I were left alone by the fire.</p><p>\u201cWere you making fun of my father?\u201d Eli whispered. I sat between his thighs, and his arms slipped around my waist. \u201cShame, shame, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head upward to look at him. The glow from the fire flicked shadows against his face, and I swear, I\u2019d never seen a more beautiful soul in my life. \u201cI\u2019m not. It\u2019s just ... funny. I\u2019m used to seeing him dress so formal. Those flip-flops are a kick in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s arms tightened around me, pulling me close. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He settled me in a way that I didn\u2019t have to crank my neck at such an awkward angle to see him. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he asked seriously. \u201cReady to go home?\u201d</p><p>I thought about it. I\u2019d experienced short bursts of weird feelings, and I couldn\u2019t describe them if I tried. They were almost like little electric jolts. But I didn\u2019t want to attack anyone anymore, so that was a good thing. \u201cYeah, I am. Ready to see Nyx and my dog\u2014so ready to get back to work,\u201d I said. I twined my fingers through his. \u201cI miss my artwork. The smell of the ink. My music.\u201d I laughed. \u201cI even miss the hum of the Widow.\u201d I met his gaze. \u201cJust keep an eye on me for a while, huh? I don\u2019t wanna slip up and accidentally hurt someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I can do that,\u201d he said with a grin. He nuzzled my neck, and his mouth brushing my skin gave me goose bumps. \u201cI\u2019ll be glad to have solid walls, a solid bed to take you in,\u201d he whispered, his gaze locking with mine. \u201cWater sex is great, but I\u2019m ready for a soft bed.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOr a hard brick wall.\u201d</p> <p>Memories of Eli taking me against the wall in my bedroom rushed through me, followed by a thrill that made my skin flush. \u201cAll that nasty sex will have to be tuned down a bit, Romeo,\u201d I said. \u201cMy brother lives with me. Remember? Don\u2019t wanna gross him out and scar him forever.\u201d</p><p>His fingers splayed against my bare stomach, caressing my hip. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to go to my place.\u201d</p><p>I studied his face for several moments, enjoying the rush of sensation that came with his fingers dragging across my skin. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel the urge to drain my blood anymore?\u201d I asked. \u201cLike before?\u201d</p><p>Eli shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s still there, just not as compelling as before,\u201d he answered. \u201cYour DNA has changed, Riley. Your blood type is still unique, but it doesn\u2019t make me crazy like before.\u201d His eyes grew dark as they searched mine. \u201cYou make me crazy now. Insane-crazy. And I crave you instead of your blood.\u201d</p><p>I leaned into him. \u201cI think I dig that, Dupr\u00e9,\u201d I said, and slipped my hand up to grasp the back of his neck, pulling his mouth closer to mine. I grazed my lips against his, and it caused an immediate reaction in Eli. His tongue swept over mine, caressed, and he kissed me long. An acorn popped in the fire, breaking our trance. I pulled back and looked at Eli.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, scooting back and smiling. \u201cMake the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eli said, then rolled his eyes. \u201cCome on, Riley. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it,\u201d I egged. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Eli studied me for a few seconds, grinned, then shook his head. \u201cGod, you\u2019re a freak\u2014you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and tucked a long fuchsia red strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cYeah, and proud of it, too. Now, come on, do it.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s face contorted in the blink of an eye; jaw unhinged, fangs long and exaggerated, eyes pure white with a red pinpoint pupil. I jumped, then stared in fascination.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d I said in a low voice, completely enthralled. \u201cWicked.\u201d</p><p>Just that fast, his features relaxed and transformed back into the beauty of Eli. He again shook his head. \u201cYou are one cheap date, Poe. A freakishly cool, cheap date.\u201d He leaned down and kissed me breathless. \u201cI like that about you.\u201d</p><p>I have to admit\u2014I had no complaints. And the way Eli made me feel? It was indescribable. He literally made my heart soar, as if my heart had a motor on it and were flying up an empty highway. As I leaned back against his chest, his steely arms wrapped completely around me and his chin propped on my shoulder, I closed my eyes. Pretending was easy enough\u2014I was a young girl in the prime of my life, with a hot, devoted boyfriend, a rockin\u2019 tattoo shop, booming business, a loving, extended Gullah family, and an adorable brother whom I loved with all my heart. I could pretend everything was normal and the world at my fingertips. I could actually almost forget that two strigoi vamps had bitten me, introduced their wicked-strong venom into my body, and left me with unpredictable tendencies\u2014and that one of the vamps wanted me. Badly. And that he would not stop until he had me.</p><p>At some point, I fell asleep; so relaxed and exhausted that I didn\u2019t remember Eli carrying me to our tent. I don\u2019t know how long I slept. But I damn sure remember being awakened....</p><p>Riley? Wake up, love. I know you are wrapped in the arms of a Dupr\u00e9, and as much as I despise it, for now, I can do nothing more than accept it. Only because I cannot be there myself and I wouldn\u2019t dare think of restraining your powerful sexual desires. It causes me physical pain to be away from you, so the only thing I can do to relieve some of the anguish is to connect our thoughts. Imagine me instead of him, Riley, and us blessedly alone. Imagine my arms holding you, my hands touching you, our bodies pressed together. Imagine right now my mouth on yours, our tongues entwined, and my fingers sliding over your soft, bare skin until they reach a place that makes you lose your mind with desire for me. I promise, you\u2019d never long for another again. So powerful my memory is of our short physical time together, I can actually inhale and smell your scent, taste you on my tongue\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRiley, wake up.\u201d</p><p>I darted straight up and looked around. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Eli laughed. \u201cSorry\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d He pushed my disheveled hair off my face. \u201cFather and Mother are up. Pacing.\u201d He grinned. \u201cTime to train.\u201d</p> <p>Putting on my best poker face, I shrugged off the heady dream-conversation\u2014one-sided though it may have been\u2014with Victorian Arcos, pulled on a clean bikini top and board shorts, and ducked out of the tent for two more days of training. I wasn\u2019t positive how long I could hide the messages I\u2019d been receiving from Victorian, and I wasn\u2019t sure how it was that Eli hadn\u2019t detected them yet. He often slipped, uninvited, into my thoughts. To be frank, I usually didn\u2019t mind. It was kind of ... a turn-on. Kinky, I know, but I\u2019d never been accused of being prim and proper. This was one time, though, I was glad Eli had stayed out of my head. When the time was right, and if I thought he proved a real threat, I\u2019d let Eli and his family know of Victorian\u2019s torment of my private thoughts. For now, though, I could handle it. I\u2019d dealt with horny pervs nearly my entire adult life, and while Victorian Arcos was a bit ... stronger, when all was broken down, he proved to be nothing more than a horny twenty-one-year-old dude. Add in the strigoi aspect of it and, okay\u2014you had an extremely powerful, horny twenty-one-year-old dude. But I was no longer a mere mortal. I had strigoi tendencies. And I could damn well handle my own freaking self. I knew if I told Eli, he\u2019d go ballistic, and there was no telling what he\u2019d do. I wanted this right now. Peace; the newness of our relationship and all that it entailed. In other words, I was selfish. I wanted Eli to myself for at least a little while, and minus the stress and anger of dealing with Victorian. I knew it wouldn\u2019t last long, anyway. All in all, though, I felt a little down. I knew the past few weeks had been unrealistic and idyllic, living on a barrier island far away from the reality of strigoi, Arcoses, newlings, and a world where human life meant nothing, their blood consumed in the most gruesome of ways. I had a gut feeling nasty changes were upon us. A fresh batch of newlings had suffered and survived a strigoi quickening; they\u2019d be hungry and out of control. They\u2019d feed, kill, as well as change other humans. It was time to step back into reality, and this time, I\u2019d go in with my eyes wide-open. I had tendencies. And I was freaking ready to use them.</p><p>Two days later ...</p><p>It felt funny being back on the mainland. This was maybe because I knew I had emerged a different sort of human, or maybe because I was keeping a big-ass secret from the mortals of Savannah. I knew what Seth and I were, what Preacher and his family were, and what the Dupr\u00e9s were. I knew Riggs and the other boys were no longer regular teenage guys. I knew Zetty was more than a big Tibetan bouncer from Kathmandu with wicked tats on his forehead. We\u2019d all changed. Maybe just knowing that made things seem so ... weird. I hoped like hell I\u2019d get used to it.</p><p>Seth rode with Gilles and Elise (yes, vamps drive and they have a kick-ass liquid silver Lexus) while I rode on the back of Eli\u2019s bike. Phin and Luc drove the boys all home, and, as far as their parents were concerned, they\u2019d all been away at a special camp. At Gilles\u2019 request, they\u2019d all\u2014Seth included\u2014continued their schoolwork so they wouldn\u2019t fall behind. A little mind control had to be issued, to the parents, principal, and teachers, but hey\u2014the job was now done. It was the weekend, and school started back on Monday. No sweat.</p><p>Gilles dropped Seth and Josie off at Inksomnia, and Eli pulled next to the curb. Before my ass even cleared the bike\u2019s seat, the front door of my ink shop flew open and Nyx bounced out like some crazed Jack Russell on crack, an excited, barking Chaz on her heels. My heart nearly popped, I was so excited to see my friend and my dog.</p> <p>We all prepared for hugs and licks.</p><p>\u201cRiley! Seth! Oh my God, you\u2019re finally home!\u201d Nyx said. Even with a pair of chunky Goth Mary-Janes, striped stockings, and black leather miniskirt, she was freaking fast. She launched herself first at Seth, and hugged him so tightly, I thought my brother wouldn\u2019t breathe for a week. But Seth wrapped his lanky arms around her just as tightly. In theory, they hadn\u2019t truly seen each other in almost two months\u2014ever since Seth began the early stages of quickening.</p><p>\u201cWow\u2014look at you,\u201d Nyx said, physically turning</p><p>Seth around. He good-naturedly allowed her to spin him several times. Finally, she stopped and stared at him in awe. \u201cYou\u2019re ... buff, dude. And tanned.\u201d</p><p>Seth grinned. \u201cRight? Crazy, huh?\u201d He flexed his biceps. \u201cCheck this out.\u201d</p><p>Nyx grasped it and squeezed. Her eyes widened. \u201cGullah magic did you good, boy.\u201d</p> <p>Seth glanced at me, then grinned widely. \u201cAbsolutely. And Nyx\u201d\u2014he wrapped his arms around her again and buried his face in her neck\u2014\u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>Nyx\u2019s big blue eyes, always full of every emotion she was feeling, misted with tears. She hugged him tightly, then pulled back; she pushed his hair off his forehead. \u201cI missed you, too, Bro. It\u2019s great to have you home again.\u201d She grasped his face gently and peered into his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want you to leave again.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s cheeks turned red. \u201cI won\u2019t, Nyx. Promise.\u201d He pulled away and knelt down. \u201cHey, boy!\u201d he said to Chaz, and scrubbed him hard between the ears. Chaz licked his face and wagged his tailless rump.</p><p>My brother always could melt a heart\u2014even a dog\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cAnd look at you!\u201d Nyx said, turning to me. Her eyes widened again as she checked me out. She pulled me into a big tight hug. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you tanned!\u201d She pulled back and held her pale arm next to my now-browned one. She grinned. \u201cIt looks good on you, Ri.\u201d She gave me another hug. \u201cGosh, I missed you guys! It\u2019s been so lonely here without you.\u201d She immediately turned to Josie and gave her a squeeze; then she turned to Eli and hugged him, too. \u201cHey, Eli, it\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d She gave him a broad smile. \u201cThanks for returning my family to me.\u201d</p><p>Eli returned the smile and nodded. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Nyx\u2019s face suddenly froze; then she turned. \u201cOh my God\u2014I have a guy in the chair!\u201d</p><p>We all watched Nyx hurry inside Inksomnia.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a great friend,\u201d I said, really to no one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to have her,\u201d Eli said, then touched my elbow to lead me inside. I whistled for Chaz, who hurried in ahead of us. The moment the scent of my ink shop hit my nose, I inhaled. It truly was great to be home.</p><p>For three straight days, all was perfect; quiet, without the first dream, or further trespassing of my thoughts by Victorian Arcos. Ned Gillespie (the guy with tendencies who\u2019d been bitten by Josie many years before) had nothing to report in regard to any vampiric activity in the Savannah area. Seth and the guys started back to school, and not surprisingly, Seth did so with enthusiasm. He\u2019d always liked school, loved learning, and was a freaking wizard at science. For all of three solid days and nights, my world was settled. God Almighty, I wished it could have lasted. Deep down inside, I\u2019d known better.</p><p>Standing at my station, I cracked my neck, rotated it a few times back and forth to loosen up the muscles, and patted the bench. \u201cHop on,\u201d I instructed an older ranger, maybe late thirties and already adorned with several pieces of art. \u201cAnd lose the shirt, sunshine, unless you think I can ink you through all that camo.\u201d</p><p>The man laughed, unbuttoned his work shirt, and shrugged out of it. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d felt like having a classics day, and to me nothing was better than a hoppin\u2019 day at Inksomnia, with lots of good-natured customers and old rock blasting through the speakers. Heart\u2019s \u201cBarracuda\u201d pulled me into that groove I loved being in when inking someone\u2014 especially someone who was not a tat virgin, like this guy.</p><p>\u201cNice boots,\u201d he said, climbing onto the bench and lying facedown.</p><p>I glanced down at my thigh-high black boots that ended just where the hem of my black leather miniskirt began. I\u2019d picked out a Blondie T-shirt, along with a pair of pink plaid suspenders to wear with the skirt\u2014pretty kick-ass if you asked me. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said, giving him a broad smile. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deploy tomorrow,\u201d he replied, in a heavy smoker\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m always ready, honey.\u201d</p><p>Rangers kicked ass. I gave him a smile and punched his arm. \u201cHurry home.\u201d</p><p>I transferred the image I\u2019d sketched and printed out from my computer onto his left flank\u2014just about the only place left on his back. It was a wicked-cool skeleton soldier\u2019s head, cigarette clenched between its teeth, wearing a World War II helmet with the words \u201cFuck Off\u201d across the front of it. Gotta love it. Once the transfer dried, I lined up my ink pots, grasped the needle, and let the Widow\u2019s hum mix with Heart\u2019s lyrics, and together they pulled me into my work. I\u2019d preferred to have stayed there, uninterrupted, in my \u201cBarracuda\u201d zone until the job was done. No such freaking luck. I\u2019d just finished the helmet\u2019s chin strap and was blotting blood when the interruption occurred.</p><p>I fed last night, Riley. I\u2019ve never enjoyed it\u2014not like my brother. But it\u2019s necessary for me to live. I promise\u2014I show mercy, and I feed only when I begin to grow weak, and I take only enough to sustain me. I do not butcher those I take from. I hope you believe me. It hurts to think you believe me a monster.</p><p>I froze, needle poised over skin, and felt my insides grow cold. Victorian\u2019s voice was so ... inside me, I could almost feel the tenor of his voice reverberating off my bones. Now he was sharing his kills with me? The thought made my blood chill. And, he wanted my sympathy? What kind of freak-vamp was he? Wide-ass awake and his voice was just as strong, just as real as if he were in the room, standing right beside me. I glanced around, just to make sure.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Nyx said from her station. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mentally, I could do nothing but shake it off. I damn sure couldn\u2019t tell Nyx what had happened. I sighed, stretched my back, and cracked my neck. \u201cNothing. Just a little stiff.\u201d I grinned at her. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Nyx eyed me for a second or two longer, shrugged, and went back to work. For once, I felt sort of glad that Eli wasn\u2019t around. He would have zeroed right in on my thoughts and all hell would\u2019ve broken loose for damn sure. Eli Dupr\u00e9 had a short fuse and would go off like a wild man, had he known Victorian Arcos was tormenting me in my thoughts. Good thing I was a big girl and could take care of myself.</p><p>For the rest of the day, the voices continued. All Victorian\u2019s voice, of course, but just when I\u2019d think he was finished, he\u2019d whisper something else, something unsettling, terrifying, inside my head. It was getting harder and harder to mask it.</p><p>Nyx had just left, my last customer was out the door, and I was on my way up the steps to my apartment to wait for Eli when Victorian interrupted once more.</p> <p>Does it bother you to know I think of you when I feed? I feel you must know the truth, for it\u2019s thoughts of you, your body bare and slick with the sweat of our lovemaking, and my cock buried deep inside you, your legs wrapped around me, begging me for more, that keep me merciful. They ... settle me. Does that make sense? I confess, it\u2019s a unique characteristic I didn\u2019t have before tasting your blood. Before part of you entered me, before we were ... connected.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d I yelled out loud. \u201cI swear to God\u2014I\u2019ll kill you myself!\u201d My heart, although uncharacteristically slow nowadays, beat hard, loud, and my breath hitched as I took the steps two at a time. Just as I kicked off my thigh-high boots and skirt, I heard the back door slam shut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home!\u201d Seth yelled.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I answered, not wanting him to know how upset I truly was.</p><p>My mind reeling, I peeled out of the rest of my clothes, grabbed a pair of black yoga pants and a sports bra, stretched, and took my frustrations out on my workout bag. I don\u2019t know how long I was at it, but I never did hear Eli enter the apartment, or my room, and God knows how long he\u2019d been standing there, reading my freaking thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been dreaming of him again,\u201d Eli said, his eyes hard, his voice low, and uncharacteristically accusing. \u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I ignored him, my emotions on edge, extended my leg fully and, with a quick snap, kicked the workout bag hanging in my bedroom. I followed it with three sharp jabs. Anger and a little hurt built inside me, and after a few more kicks and rounds of punches, I broke a decent sweat.</p><p>Eli\u2019s strong hands grasped my shoulders and spun me around. \u201cDon\u2019t ignore me, Riley.\u201d He drew his face close to mine. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, totally pissed. \u201cThen don\u2019t accuse me, Eli.\u201d I shook his hands off. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t help those dreams. You know it.\u201d</p><p>Eli stared at me several long seconds, then shoved his fingers through his hair, muttered some French expletive, and walked to the window. He looked at some distant point across the river. \u201cYou desire him.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed inside me, and I crossed my arms over my chest. \u201cHow freaking old are you, Eli?\u201d I asked. \u201cSixteen? Oh, no\u2014that\u2019s right. You\u2019re over two hundred.\u201d I walked up behind him, grabbed him by the arm, and turned him around to face me. Brilliant blue eyes searched mine, and I knew he was reading my thoughts; digging through them like a madman was more like it. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a jealous high school boyfriend,\u201d I said, a little more gently. I grazed his jaw with my index finger. \u201cSeriously, Eli.\u201d</p> <p>Another handful of seconds dragged by before his face went emotionless, his eyes dulled, those beautiful full lips that worked magic against my body thinned. \u201cYou don\u2019t deny it, do you Riley?\u201d His voice held an edge, tinged with a heavier-than-usual bit of French. I\u2019d learned fast that the heavier the accent, the more pissed off Eli Dupr\u00e9 was.</p><p>\u201cVictorian forces the dreams on me,\u201d I said harshly. \u201cJust as he forces the emotions within them.\u201d I stepped closer. \u201cI. Can\u2019t. Help. It.\u201d</p><p>Anger pulled his features tighter. \u201cDo you think this is some game? He is deadly, Riley. Do you think he has feelings for you? Other than obsession? He will drain every ounce of your blood in seconds. Regrets might come after it\u2019s too late.\u201d His eyes grew somber. \u201cI think you enjoy the dreams a little too much,\u201d he said, moving past me. At the door, he stopped, staring straight ahead. \u201cYou could have come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done, Eli?\u201d I said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go into my subconscious and change anything. You can\u2019t make him stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I can do,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a fucking chance.\u201d</p><p>He moved so fast, I didn\u2019t see him actually turn and leave. Only the sound of the back door closing alerted me to his absence.</p><p>I walked to the window overlooking River Street, propped a hip against the ledge, and stared out into the growing darkness. Soon, it would be pitch-black outside\u2014everdark (the Gullah pronounced it evah-dock). It meant, pretty much, everlasting darkness. That was what it felt like, too\u2014an endless night. Leaning forward, I pressed my forehead against the cool pane. Eli wasn\u2019t right, not by far. I did not enjoy the dreams; rather, the internal conversations I\u2019d reluctantly had with the younger Arcos. Nor did I desire Victorian. In the dreams, I wanted two things: to continue the turn-on, then nothing more than for him to stop, to leave me the hell alone; he never did. He returned to me, time after time, with the most erotic, out-of-control dreams that make me respond to him in ways that mortified me. I loathed him. He made me excited. Yet I got a rush when his voice sounded inside my head.</p><p>Worse still, Victorian had begun speaking to me during my waking hours. Somehow, he\u2019d gotten inside my head outside of the dreams. The only cause I could assume to be the reason for this was that we shared the strigoi DNA. I thought I could handle it. I wanted the bastard dead. I was the only one who could get close enough to do it. Dammit.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was that all about? You okay?\u201d</p><p>I turned and met Seth\u2019s concerned gaze. I was a balled-up bundle of hot electrical wires, and I needed to burn off a little energy. It was either that or bang my head against a brick wall. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Bro. Seriously. You wanna go for a run?\u201d</p><p>My brother gave me a crooked grin. \u201cI\u2019ll pass. I\u2019m meeting Josie for a little roof jumping.\u201d He wiggled his brows at me.</p><p>Seth Poe was definitely enjoying his vampiric tendencies. The kid had serious free-running talent. I\u2019d been watching him closely, just to see if anything else, possibly weird, popped up. So far, it hadn\u2019t. I grinned. \u201cGotcha. I\u2019ll catch ya later.\u201d</p><p>Those fathomless green eyes stared at me for a moment; then Seth pulled me into a tight hug. \u201cLove ya, Sis.\u201d Then he disappeared out the door.</p><p>I shook my head, yanked on my sneakers, and headed out into the early-September night air, crossed the merchant\u2019s drive, climbed the metal steps to Bay Street, and took off.</p><p>Savannah in September was still warm and humid, and the brine from the river clung heavily to the air. I drew it in fully as I ran, the muscles in my legs stretching with each long stride. I could go faster\u2014much faster\u2014but that would seriously draw attention. I mean, I can haul ass. Instead, though, I kept it to a typical human\u2019s pace, crossed Bay behind a group of ghost walkers, and headed up Bryan Street. Finally, I found myself alone. Full darkness had fallen, and I increased my speed, stretching my legs. Long shadows fell from the lampposts, parking meters, and the massive oaks that lined nearly every side street in the historic district. Everything looked distorted. I turned the corner and glanced over my shoulder.</p><p>An arm shot out of the shadows, clotheslined me, and knocked me flat on my back. I\u2019d barely felt the sidewalk beneath me before I leapt up, adrenaline rushing, body rigid, poised, crouched, and ready to fight. I stared hard into the shadows.</p><p>I knew who awaited me before he emerged.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies for using such force to stop you,\u201d Victorian Arcos said in a low, seductive voice, \u201cbut you\u2019re amazingly fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to you and your brother,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhat are you doing here? They\u2019ll kill you if they find you.\u201d I met his gaze with a hard one. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Victorian stepped fully into the lamplight, and again I was stunned by his beauty. He looked older than twenty-one. Gone was the eighteenth-century clothing from before. Although he still kept his sleek black hair long and pulled into a queue, he was now dressed in a loose white button-down shirt hanging untucked from a pair of worn jeans and scuffed boots. It was difficult to believe he was so young. Well, that plus several hundred years. Apparently, my death threat fazed him nada.</p><p>He closed his eyes and drew in a lungful of air, then looked at me. \u201cI can barely smell your blood,\u201d he said, stepping closer and inhaling deeply again. \u201cYour dark brothers must have changed the drugs they use to mask your scent.\u201d Light reflected in his deep brown eyes, and they studied me closely, intensely. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I had to see you.\u201d</p><p>A car turned up the street, and the headlights flashed toward us. In the blink of an eye, Victorian stepped in front of me, pushing me backward through the thick, damp grass, and into the shadows of an aged brick historic house that dominated nearly an entire block. The car passed; the headlight beams swept above our heads, and then left us in total darkness. Victorian, who stood at least six feet tall, moved slowly, crowding me and forcing me to back up. I stopped when the brick pressed into my back. I felt completely powerless, as though I possessed zero control of my actions, my thoughts, my new tendencies\u2014almost as if I\u2019d had a stroke. The younger Arcos took full advantage.</p><p>He stared down at me, desire radiating off his body in heady waves. \u201cYou torture me, Riley,\u201d he said, his Romanian accent making his words seductive, erotic. \u201cI think of nothing else but you\u201d\u2014he leaned close, his mouth brushing my jaw\u2014\u201cand of what I want to do to you.\u201d His soft lips grazed the skin at my neck, where he lingered, and a flash of fear mixed with an uncontrolled shiver rushed through me. \u201cOf what I dream of you doing to me,\u201d he said at my ear. \u201cIt causes me physical pain to stay away, Riley Poe.\u201d His mouth moved to my jaw, dragging his lips to my chin, close to my mouth. \u201cI want you now,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want to keep you forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was shaking, my mind numb, my limbs paralyzed, and sensations tingled across the skin where his lips moved so erotically. I didn\u2019t want this, or his touch. I couldn\u2019t help but crave it. I breathed, squeezed my eyes shut, opened them, gathered my strength\u2014God only knew where it came from\u2014lifted my hands to his chest and pushed. Hard. Victorian flew backward and landed on his back several feet away. He lay there, staring at me and smiling.</p><p>When next I blinked, he stood in front of me, close, crowding me once more, his hands grasping my wrists and grating my knuckles against the brick wall at my back. He lowered his head, his lips whispering against mine.</p><p>\u201cYour tendencies do nothing more than fascinate me\u201d\u2014his mouth moved against mine\u2014\u201cand excite me even more.\u201d He pulled back and looked at me. \u201cWhat other tricks do you possess that I might enjoy?\u201d His alluring scent surrounded me as his mouth covered mine\u2014</p> <p>\u201cRiley?\u201d A hand grasped my shoulder and shook\u2014hard. \u201cRiley, wake up, dammit.\u201d</p><p>I gasped; my eyes fluttered open and I stared, confused, into Eli\u2019s questioning gaze. Behind him, early-morning sun streamed in through my bedroom window, casting a hazy glow on his face. He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dreaming of him again,\u201d he said, his eyes hard and accusing. \u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I glanced down. I still wore the same black yoga pants and sports bra I\u2019d gone for a run in the night before. I\u2019d encountered Victorian on that run. Hadn\u2019t I? Or had it all really been a dream? I looked at my knuckles; the skin across them was scraped raw.</p><p>Inside my head,Victorian\u2019s seductive laugh resonated.</p><p>Now, either that little fucker was messing with me, or I was losing my goddamn mind.</p> <p>Part Three</p><p>TERRORS</p><p>\u201cDeath is when the monsters get you.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Stephen King, Salem\u2019s Lot</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve started having ... visions. Night terrors.</p><p>Day terrors. And they\u2019re not of Victorian. It\u2019s</p> <p>something\u2014or someone\u2014else; I get the sick</p><p>feeling they\u2019re weirdly familiar. I\u2019m seeing in-</p><p>nocents die horrible deaths at the hands of a</p><p>vicious monster; watching it happen through</p><p>my own eyes as though it\u2019s me doing the kill-</p><p>ing; as if I\u2019m the monster. I even feel what the</p><p>monster is experiencing, and it\u2019s ... disgusting.</p><p>I\u2019m not kidding\u2014something\u2019s gotta give be-</p> <p>cause I can\u2019t freaking take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>By the time I\u2019d closed Inksomnia\u2019s doors a few nights later, I\u2019d realized with complete lucidity that our lives\u2014all of our lives\u2014would never be the same again. There were no rose-colored glasses here. Nope. My goggles were scratch free and squeaky-clean, and, to be honest, I suppose I\u2019d rather it be that way. Better to know what\u2019s coming than to ignorantly stand around with your thumb up your butt, waiting for junk to happen.</p><p>For instance, Preacher and Estelle no longer had to what the Gullah referred to as \u201cfix\u201d me. Let\u2019s face it. My DNA was royally screwed up, so I no longer needed that particular concoction of God-Knows-What from Preacher\u2019s special behind-the-haint-blue-curtain herb collection. I still had to have something\u2014I mean, I was still human after all\u2014but not such a heavy dose, and my Gullah grandparents no longer had to trick me daily into drinking my protective tea. I willingly did so and kept a mammoth canister of it on my kitchen counter. Gilles said that because I had the venom of two strigoi vampires\u2019 mixed with my DNA, my blood would slowly start morphing into something unique, and soon I wouldn\u2019t even need the tea. I\u2019m not sure if I should have been happy or freaked about that. Lucky for my brother, he had the venom of only one strigoi mixed with his DNA. We\u2019re both pretty messed up, though, I guess you could say. Messed up, but not stupid.</p><p>Another thing I\u2019ve noticed, and this just since getting back home, is my senses. They\u2019re changing. I mean, I\u2019d known about the whole werewolf/Arcos bit, but damn\u2014I didn\u2019t realize it\u2019d get so intense. Or that it\u2019d continue to alter as it has. My hearing is ridiculously acute. I\u2019m starting to hear the most insane sounds, like the nuns over at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist (aka Cinderella\u2019s Castle by Seth and me), and that\u2019s all the way over on East Harris Street. I can literally hear them praying. At first, it was nothing more than a cluster of hushed murmuring whispers; but, by the second day, the whispers were totally clear and I could understand every word being muttered\u2014every single word. It made me feel like some freaky eavesdropping voyeur or something. Weird. Even weirder was that I could now pick up heartbeats, and only God knew how far away they were. I heard them everywhere, and after a while it began to seriously grate on the nerves. Thump thump thump thump thump thump. Thump freaking thump. Eli promised to teach me how to channel it, tune it out, or make use of it. I was looking forward to learning those tricks and hopefully soon, because I felt as if I\u2019 were constantly holed up in a crowded bar with some drunken idiot banging a set of drums. The softer the sound, the louder it was inside my head. It was driving me frickin\u2019 nuts.</p><p>And my sense of smell was almost just as crazy. I could detect everything from a joint being toked three blocks away in an upstairs apartment, to some nasty drunk dude farting batter-fried onion rings in the corner booth at Spanky\u2019s.</p><p>I was standing in my kitchen, steeping strong Gullah tea, when the first terror-vision hit me. I wished to God it was my last. It wasn\u2019t. I remember glancing at the time on my Kit-Cat Klock\u20148:44 a.m.</p><p>A paralyzing grip suddenly snatched control of my body; I dropped the spoon I was using to stir sugar into my tea, and it clattered against the granite countertop, then hit the floor. I couldn\u2019t feel my fingers or toes, and, at first, I couldn\u2019t breathe. The insides of my eyes, behind the sockets, turned boiling hot, then frigidly cold. A loud ringing in my ears drowned out any and all noises, including the ones I heard blocks away. Then everything went pitch-black. I tried to speak, but my vocal cords were paralyzed, too. Panic, mixed with anger, seized me.</p><p>All at once, a live scene flashed behind my lids. It was nightfall, and I was following a girl out of the mall. I wasn\u2019t completely unfamiliar with the place, but it definitely wasn\u2019t Savannah. Young, petite, and blond, looking to be in her early twenties, wearing red flip-flops, holey jeans, and a purple tank top, she swung her hips as she made her way toward the covered parking garage. She happily chatted to someone on her cell and didn\u2019t seem to notice me. A horn blew from somewhere in the garage, and the girl squealed, then giggled to her phone companion. I grew closer. In the distance, sounds of traffic filled the night air.</p><p>Long shadows, birthed from low light cast from the overhead lamps bracketed onto concrete pillars, fell over the row of sparsely parked cars. Not many people were about on a weeknight; no one was in the direct vicinity of the girl. She turned down the row with a white metal sign marked by a black capital B. I watched her closely. She dug through her purse and retrieved a set of keys. At the same time, she stopped at a white Camry and pushed the key release. The horn gave one short blast as it unlocked the doors. With her chin she held her cell, and she reached for the door handle.</p><p>Hands not my own grabbed her, whipped her around, and slammed her back against the car. Large blue eyes widened in fear and confusion as they stared, horrified, into mine. Tremors of fear wracked her body; I could feel them. Adrenaline rushed through her veins; I could hear the swooshing sound it made as though magnified, only to my ears. Her heart slammed rapidly against her ribs, faster, harder. At the indention in her throat, her pulse beckoned me. The moment she filled her lungs with air to scream, I lunged at her neck and sank my teeth into her flesh. The scream died in her throat as I ripped through her larynx and her vocal cords, until the vessel I sought popped; a rush of wet warmth, sweet, erotic, and heady, saturated the inside of my mouth. I suckled her blood, excitement rushing through me as I felt the liquid slide down my throat. The girl\u2019s body jerked, involuntarily, as life left her. The jerks were hard at first, then weaker. The instant she sagged against me, her heart having stilled and her eyes dull and lifeless, I dropped her body. It crumpled into a heap at my feet, and I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>Strong hands gripped my shoulders and shook me until my blurred vision cleared, and Seth\u2019s worried face came into view. He shook me again and shouted so loud my ears rang. \u201cRi, wake up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, back off, Bro,\u201d I said, and shook his hands off me. I squeezed my eyes shut, opened them, and looked around. Slowly, my surroundings came into focus. I glanced at the Kit-Cat Klock on the wall. It was 8:50 a.m. Six minutes had passed.</p><p>What the fu\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour eyes were blank, but your face ... ,\u201d he said, and it was then I noticed for the first time his voice had deepened.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my face?\u201d I asked. I moved to the sink, flipped the faucet on, and splashed myself with cold water.</p><p>Seth passed me the hand towel. \u201cYou looked, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, then looked at me with his expressive green eyes. \u201cMean. You looked mean, Ri. Scary-mean. Not yourself.\u201d</p><p>I dried my face and thought about that. \u201cDid I say anything?\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his head, a hank of dark hair falling into his eyes. He pushed it back. \u201cNo. You just stood there, staring, and looking ... hateful.\u201d</p><p>The memory of the vision struck me, rushing back full force. I met my brother\u2019s worried gaze. \u201cI saw something, Seth. Like a daydream, only it was so freaking real. It was\u201d\u2014I searched for the right word\u2014\u201csickening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d he asked, and I noticed then how worried he truly was. His brows pulled into a frown, his mouth thin. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and dug my fingers into the sockets, rubbing hard. I looked at my brother. \u201cI saw a kill. I saw a vampire feed.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s face grew pale, and his eyes widened. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mouth went dry as the memory of the vision, so clear and realistic, pushed to the very forefront of my mind. \u201cIt was as though I were him; I saw everything as if I were the killer, only when my hands reached out, they were not mine. They were his.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI felt everything, Seth. The girl\u2019s terror. The rush of excitement as my teeth sank into her artery. The blood as it pumped into my throat. Every freaking thing.\u201d Suddenly, my stomach rolled, every detail returning in vivid recall, and I felt the color drain from my face. My skin grew clammy. I covered my mouth with my hand. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d</p><p>Seth grabbed my arm and pulled me down the hall and into the bathroom with such speed, my head spun just as violently as my stomach. Even then, we barely made it. I stumbled, kicked the lid open with my foot, and retched into the toilet. Seth held my hair back while I lost last night\u2019s lo mein noodles.</p><p>A cold, wet washcloth was suddenly resting on the back of my neck. Seth flushed the toilet, closed the lid, turned me around, and pushed me down onto it. I rested my forearms on my knees and breathed, and my baby brother, who seemed so grown up lately, squatted down to look at me. Green eyes just like mine met me with intensity.</p> <p>\u201cYou gotta tell Eli,\u201d Seth said.</p><p>I thought about it. \u201cMaybe. But I\u2019m not. It\u2019s probably just my mind effing with me, you know? That night at Bonaventure still haunts me. Seriously. It\u2019s just a lot of crap to take in. We\u2019ve been through hell, little brother. Nasty-hell.\u201d</p><p>The frown still on Seth\u2019s face proved he didn\u2019t really believe me. \u201cYeah, I know, he said. He ducked his head. \u201cYou okay, Ri?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t. Not at all. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m totally fine. Let\u2019s get out of here, okay? And,\u201d I said, playfully punching his arm, \u201cthanks. Not many dudes would hold a girl\u2019s hair while she puked her guts up.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not just any ole dude, and you\u2019re my sister. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>My heart was melting.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d hug you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, gross,\u201d he finished, taking a step back. He held up his hands in defense. \u201cNo postpuke hugging, please. That\u2019s just nasty.\u201d He shuddered.</p><p>We both laughed, and I did my very best for the rest of the day to forget the horror of the daydream. Good thing it was Sunday and Inksomnia was closed. I\u2019m not positive I could have kept it to myself.</p><p>Eli had gone with his brothers and Gilles to some monthly guardian meeting at Bethesda with Preacher and his people, and while I missed being with Eli, I\u2019d craved time alone with my little brother. So I spent the early part of the day with just Seth. It seemed like forever since we\u2019d done that, and even in spite of the awful, realistic daydream, we had fun. We had breakfast with Estelle and took Chaz to Forsythe Park for a long walk. Then later we hit Cleary\u2019s for lunch. We both had the Reuben, and, swear to God, they make the best ones in Savannah. I could have eaten two and had to literally stop myself from ordering a second.</p><p>One of the tendencies Seth and I shared: voracious appetites. We both ate like friggin\u2019 hogs. Luckily our metabolisms kept up with the amount of food we dumped in.</p> <p>On the way home, we hit the Pig (that\u2019s the everpopular southern grocery chain store Piggly Wiggly, aka Hoggly Woggly, aka the PW), picked up some milk, dog food, a twelve-pack of Cherry Coke, a pack of T-bones, another twelve-pack of Octoberfest, some junk food, and a few things for Estelle, then headed home. As we cruised the city streets with the top off the Jeep, the sun pelted me through the sporadic holes in the overhead canopy of oaks and pines. As my skin warmed, and the briny breeze wafted from the Savannah River to my nostrils, I could almost put behind me the horribleness of that damn daydream, and the way that girl had died; the way I\u2019d felt it, tasted it, experienced it, and how wickedsick real it had been. I mean, I\u2019d tasted her blood. I\u2019d felt it slide down my throat. How the hell could that be?</p><p>The girl\u2019s face kept randomly flashing behind my lids, and it was disturbing as holy freaking hell. Her facial features, right down to the small gap in her front teeth, seemed so exact. It was almost as if I\u2019d met her before. Maybe she was a past client I\u2019d inked? That could definitely be a possibility. I\u2019d inked a lot of people. Overall, though\u2014why her?</p><p>The afternoon sun waned, and weak early-evening shadows now fell from lampposts, live oaks, and parking meters as we crossed Bay, pulled onto the merchant\u2019s drive and parked the Jeep behind Inksomnia.</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s Eli,\u201d Seth said, and pointed.</p><p>Eli was there, waiting for me, and, I confess, he had the sole capability to take my breath away. His bike was almost as hot as he was. The liquid silverback chopper sat propped on its kickstand, half helmet hanging off a handlebar, the whole package looking kick-ass. Eli leaned casually against the seat; legs crossed at the ankles, arms folded over his chest, he was wearing nothing but a pair of low-slung worn jeans, boots, and a white T-shirt, and the silver hoop at his brow. I couldn\u2019t see his eyes\u2014they were masked by his shades\u2014but I knew he stared at me. He studied every inch of me. My sex drive kicked me mule-hard, and I wanted him. Just knowing he watched me behind the privacy of his sunglasses shot a thrill through me. A sexier man did not exist, I swear it.</p><p>A small smile tilted the corner of his mouth. Freaking ego. Of course, he\u2019d been listening and had joyfully heard every word I\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cHey, Eli,\u201d Seth said cheerfully, grabbing nearly all the bags from the back of the Jeep. He had a twenty-five-pound bag of Chaz\u2019s dog food slung over one shoulder as he passed what no one would ever guess to be a nearly two-hundred-year-old vampire.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Seth?\u201d Eli answered, but he didn\u2019t move. Behind those shades his gaze remained fixed on me.</p> <p>\u201cNothin\u2019 much. Hangin\u2019 with the sister,\u201d Seth said with a grin, and disappeared inside. Chaz\u2019s excited bark met my ears, and in seconds, Seth emerged with the Australian shepherd on a leash. \u201cBe back in a bit,\u201d he said, his smile wide. \u201cWe\u2019ve got training at your folk\u2019s place at eight. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d He waved and disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Eli didn\u2019t move. He mouthed, Come here, and, oh hell yeah, I did just that. I stepped out of the Jeep and swaggered over to him, hoping I was half as distracting to him as he was to me. I was wearing my faded low-rise jeans and the fuchsia floral cami I knew he liked\u2014 mainly because it skimmed just above my belly button. I stopped when I was directly in front of him and placed one leg on either side of his. I leaned forward, bracing my weight with the heel of my palms on the sides of his hips. I drew so close, our noses nearly touched. I could see my reflection in his shades.</p><p>Neither of us said a word.</p><p>Eli\u2019s hands slipped around my waist, grazing the bare skin of my lower back, and moved his mouth over mine in a kiss that had me wet and burning for him within five seconds. My hands slid up his back and around his neck; I kissed him back. The slightest pressure pulled my body against his, and I briefly thought how well we fit together. His hands moved over my ass; his hard bulge let me know I affected him just as much, and I groaned against his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not above taking you right here, right now,\u201d I whispered, and licked his tongue. I felt his smile beneath my lips.</p><p>\u201cAnother thing I love about you,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not shy.\u201d His fingers threaded through my hair and he pulled me tight against his mouth. His kiss drugged me.</p><p>Finally, breathless, and just a shade under being pornographic in public, I leaned back and took off his shades. His profound stare never ceased to stun me; the weight of it froze me. Fathomless and ancient at once, his eyes locked on to mine. It was then I knew with complete certainty that I\u2019d never be satisfied with anyone else except Eli\u2014a pretty scary thought, actually.</p><p>The sexiest grin I\u2019d ever seen crossed his face. \u201cAh, my evil plan has succeeded. Come here, mostly mortal woman. There is nothing to be scared of. Let me ravish you,\u201d he drawled in heavy French. I laughed, and he pushed a loose strand of fuchsia hair out of my eyes and tucked it behind my ear. Then he stopped, studying me; his gaze narrowed, and a slight early-evening breeze rustled his already-tousled hair. All playfulness had vanished, replaced by uncanny perception. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cNothing. A dream I had earlier shook me up a little.\u201d I sighed. \u201cFreaking vampires.\u201d</p><p>Eli pulled me close and buried his face in my hair. He inhaled deeply. \u201cMust\u2019ve shaken you more than a little.\u201d He leaned back and frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re making goofy jokes and you didn\u2019t drink your tea.\u201d</p><p>That he could smell my unprotected blood amazed me; it also knocked me a notch or two back to reality.</p><p>\u201cIt should,\u201d he said, taking more liberties with my thoughts. \u201cYou might think you\u2019re invincible with your new tendencies, but trust me\u2014you\u2019re not. Your blood may have changed some; I don\u2019t zone in on it rushing through your veins like I used to. But it\u2019s still tempting, addicting.\u201d He frowned. \u201cDrink the damn tea, Riley. I don\u2019t care if you eat the stuff. Just get it into your system.\u201d He grazed my jaw with a finger. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I answered. \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to forget it, even though your dad told me that because of the strigoi factor in my DNA, I may be able to stop the tea altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not now, so humor me. Drink the tea.\u201d With his index finger, Eli traced the dragon inked into my skin; all the way up my arm. He followed it until it disappeared beneath my shirt; then Eli grasped my chin. The look he gave me sent two kinds of chills up my spine\u2014one of fear; one of pure sexual heat. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to work so hard not to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken, Dupr\u00e9,\u201d I said, and I reminded myself I was crazy about a vampire who could kill me in seconds if he lost control. \u201cGetting tea now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014my parents want us to have dinner with them Saturday night,\u201d Eli said as we made our way into my ink shop. \u201cFormal wear. You and Seth.\u201d He grinned down at me as we walked. \u201cEvery once in a while they like to dress up, like in the old days when, you know\u2014that\u2019s the way it was done. Old music and stuff. It\u2019s kinda fun. You up for it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mind mentally scanned my closet, then scanned Seth\u2019s. \u201cWhen you say \u2018dress up like in the old days,\u2019 do you mean corsets and funny hoops beneath my dress, or what?\u201d</p><p>Eli laughed. \u201cNo, just modern formal wear.\u201d</p><p>At the door I stopped, rose up on my toes, and kissed him. \u201cI\u2019m not your typical debutante, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he answered, eyes locked on mine. \u201cIt\u2019s one of your charms.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cYep. We\u2019re up for it. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d</p><p>Seth rounded the corner alley with Chaz just as we were stepping inside. \u201cSounds good. I\u2019ll ask Nyx to take my appointments after five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Seth asked as we walked through the doorway. Chaz ran ahead, his nails clicking on the wood plank floor.</p> <p>\u201cDinner with Dracula and Company,\u201d I answered, shooting Eli a smart-ass grin. \u201cSaturday night. Seven. And no Vans and baggy shorts with the crotch at the knees and your drawers hanging out. Formal wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d Seth said.</p><p>Eli just smiled and shook his head.</p><p>We spent the rest of Sunday pretending everything was normal. I guess for us, it was, although my mind never fully let loose the events that led me to where I\u2019m at right now. Part of me was glad; Eli was in my life. For how long, I didn\u2019t know. The other part hated it. The Arcoses had nearly claimed my baby brother, and I don\u2019t know if I could have survived that.</p><p>We walked Estelle\u2019s stuff over and visited with her and Preacher for a bit. Their back kitchen seemed like a mystical, unearthly place now, dimmed lights and shadows, where the unique African herbs and concoctions from Da Plat Eye wafted in like some crazy aromatic air infusion. Estelle\u2019s sausage, shrimp, and red rice stewed on the stovetop, and she sat in the corner, surrounded by sweetgrass strands, weaving a basket and wearing her hair wrapped in one of her colorful traditional Gullah cloths. Preacher sat, wearing his usual long-sleeved plaid shirt and denims (he called them dungarees, and that totally cracked me up), scolding me (after Eli ratted me out) about forgetting my tea.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019 get too complacent, girl,\u201d Preacher had said, his ebony skin a beautiful contrast to his snow-white hair. He reminded me of an older Danny Glover. \u201cI mean dat, right. You git too big for your britches, you might get hurt.\u201d He\u2019d reached over and grasped my hands with his. \u201cI ain\u2019t puttin\u2019 up wit dat, now.\u201d</p> <p>Capote, Preacher\u2019s cousin, had stopped by, and I swear, he was one funny-ass old man. He never, never went without a big, blinding smile, and he always had some sort of hysterical story to tell about him and Preacher from their childhood. He sat at the table with us, a bag of boiled peanuts in his lap, eating and shelling just as fast as his fingers and mouth would work. He\u2019d looked at me and shaken his head. \u201cGirl, you done fell in wit some crazy folk, right?\u201d he\u2019d said, jerking his head toward Eli. \u201cDem Dupr\u00e9s\u2014wooo, now, you done fell in wit dem for sure.\u201d He laughed and shook his head again. \u201cDey good folk doh, dat\u2019s right. Always have been. Dey treat you good. You do da same.\u201d</p><p>Once we left Preacher\u2019s (with a big Tupperware filled with Estelle\u2019s gumbo and a bag of boiled peanuts\u2014I swear I could live off them), we headed to Monterey Square. Seth was already there with Josie; Phin and Luc had just returned from Tybee (they\u2019d been checking out some new gaming software Ned Gillespie had developed); the Lord of the Flies boys, along with Zetty, walked in behind Eli and me. We\u2019d all agreed on group training twice a week at the Dupr\u00e9 House, where the complete top floor had been renovated into a wicked-awesome, upgraded donjon. It\u2019d been pretty cool as a gym before, but now? Damn. I walked in for the first time and stared.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I muttered, and looked around at the punching bags, table of blades, the vamp dummies, and the various-sized surfaces\u2014pretty much synthetic rock\u2014for leaping and jumping. I glanced at Elise and Gilles, who\u2019d followed us upstairs. \u201cYou\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sweet Mr. and Mrs. D.,\u201d Riggs said, pushing past me. \u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Riggs; at his baggy shorts, his Eminem T-shirt, and his Nike Airs, and then, his shaggy hair held in place by a red bandanna. \u201cNice headband, Riggs,\u201d I said, noticing he had one holding back his bangs.</p><p>\u201cI wore it just for you, babe,\u201d he said, grinning. He inclined his head. \u201cWanna spar?\u201d</p><p>I grinned back. The little turd knew I hated being called babe. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Luc let out a whistle, clapped, and smiled, the hoop in his lip silver and, in my biased opinion, so him. \u201cYeah, baby\u2014some action! Step back, folks\u2014kids, wannabes\u201d\u2014he glanced at his parents\u2014\u201cand the elderly.\u201d He grinned and backed toward the wall. \u201cPoe\u2019s got the floor.\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes at him\u2014what a nerd. I pointed at him. \u201cYou\u2019re next.\u201d</p><p>A round of oooh\u2019s went through the donjon.</p><p>Elise Dupr\u00e9 smiled broadly at me. \u201cThat I\u2019ll be looking forward to, darling.\u201d She turned to Gilles. \u201cWe\u2019ve got that auction on eBay, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui,\u201d he answered, and, grinning, the two left the donjon.</p><p>I felt pretty certain she hadn\u2019t particularly appreciated being called elderly. It was one thing to think it, but to say it? Eesh. I did think it hilarious that the matriarch and patriarch of the family raced to eBay auctions.</p><p>Riggs sauntered to the center of the mat, whipped his Emenem shirt over his head, and tossed it aside, leaving a pretty impressive six-pack (for a kid) exposed. Good God, that boy thought his boat rocked. Before he had tendencies, he was just a smart-ass adolescent with a cocky attitude. Now he had ... powers. And while his experience had matured him some, he was still, well, pervy, cocky Riggs. Now he and his ego would be impossible to live with. He needed an attitude adjustment.</p><p>I was going to kick his ass.</p><p>With a quick glance at Eli, whose wicked grin told me he\u2019d just read my thoughts, I met Riggs on the mat. The others watching clapped, Phin whistled again, and Riggs began to circle me. I let him\u2014for a few. You know, he had to show off a little, for the other Flies, and I gave him that. He did some pretty amazing wall jumps (where he ran toward the wall, then sort of ran up it, then flipped over me), some sick leaps directly over my head, and a few cool roundhouse kicks. Yep. He was one impressive little shit-with-tendencies.</p><p>The moment he landed from his roundhouse, I crouched and swept his legs with one kick. Riggs hit the mat, back down with a smack. Everyone laughed, clapped\u2014whatever.</p><p>Riggs stared up at me from the floor, grinning, as I extended my hand. He took it, and I pulled him up. He leaned close. \u201cSee? I knew I\u2019d get you to touch me,\u201d he said in my ear. \u201cBabe.\u201d</p><p>Then, all at once, several things, none of which I had any control over, hit me hard.</p><p>Quick as lightning, Riggs grasped my forearm and whole-body flipped me. As I went airborne, that same sick sensation I\u2019d experienced with Seth came over me; I knew another awful image was about to fill my brain. My body went limp, and shadows fell behind my eyelids. I saw nothing, heard nothing\u2014couldn\u2019t speak, and I don\u2019t remember even hitting the mat. I remained weightless in some dark, cloudy fog, where nothing else existed, as if I\u2019d totally left the donjon. Finally, a sound\u2014a heartbeat. I can\u2019t tell you if it was mine or someone else\u2019s. At first, it was muffled, but it grew in tone and intensity.</p><p>Then, slowly, my vision returned. Blurred at first, it went in and out of tune like an old TV set, and finally, it focused on ... I blinked several times. A girl. In a bar. No, a club. In a booth. Music banging. Punk music banging. Surroundings unfamiliar. Girl unfamiliar. Girl totally wasted. She was a partier, midtwenties, heavy black eye makeup, Marilyn Monroe\u2013ish, white-bleached bobbed hair with orange streaks. Her black leather strapless bustier barely contained her heavy breasts. She leaned over the table, picked up the glass of her mixed drink, and licked first the rim, then her dark red lips. Her brown eyes were hazed, and her pheromones were so pungent, I could smell them. She was horny and wanted me, only ... I wasn\u2019t me. Of course I wasn\u2019t me. I wasn\u2019t into girls. She saw him; not me. I could hear her heart beating erratically. She reached out for my hand, grasped it, and I looked down. The hand wasn\u2019t mine. It was male; older, rough-skinned, not Victorian\u2019s smooth pale skin. I knew that, though.</p><p>She stood and led me out of the booth. The leather miniskirt she was wearing hardly covered her ass, and the bustier was laced in back, revealing bare skin. I noticed a tattoo on her lower back. It was Death\u2019s fingers, his long skeletal bones spread out across her, beckoning; it was my work. I had inked her before. She was laughing, stumbling as she made her way to the exit. She was pulling me, and I could feel her hand in mine; yet ... it wasn\u2019t me. But I could feel whoever it was. I knew what was going to happen; I could feel the anticipation of the kill inside me. I tried to move my lips, vibrated my vocal cords, and tried to warn her. I tried to scream, and deep inside me, I felt immense anxiety to warn her. It was no use. I was speechless, useless, not really even here. I could do nothing but watch\u2014watch and be horrified.</p><p>The girl pushed out into the night, and the air was muggy, heavy; the faint scent of salt clung to my tongue. She hung on me as we walked, and she half stumbled, half pulled me along the sidewalk, drunkenly laughing, until the lights from the club, the thumping music from within, became dull and barely there. I heard only her heartbeat. I tried to yank back, but my body wasn\u2019t really my own. Long shadows fell across her, and she pulled me into an alley. The scent of mingled mold and urine and brine reached my nostrils, and she fell against the brick wall, staring at me with her wide, drug-hazed, lust-filled eyes. How stupid she was; how utterly freaking ignorantly stupid.</p><p>A zipper closed the front of her leather bustier. She grasped the metal tab and pulled it down to her waist. Her breasts spilled out, and she grabbed my hands, pressing them to her skin. Inwardly, I resisted. Again, it was no use. Her head fell back, and she moaned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was the very last sound she ever voluntarily made.</p><p>The heartbeat I felt wasn\u2019t mine, but hers, and it resonated within my head, strong, heady, and I lunged at her bared chest. Her moan died in a liquid curdling sound as her body fell hard to the cobbled ground; I followed her down. Blood, bone, and flesh flashed before my eyes, a vicious carnage that nauseated me. I couldn\u2019t pull away, I couldn\u2019t look away. Yet the need, the hunger\u2014the horror\u2014roared within me. Liquid warmth flowed down my throat, sweet, intoxicating, and my throat constricted as I sucked.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p> <p>My head snapped, hitting something hard, and my cheek stung as a hand smacked it. My eyes fluttered open, and I stared up\u2014into the widened eyes of Riggs. He was straddling me, I was flat on my back on the donjon mat, and his hand was raised to give me another smack. His hand never reached my skin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that again, kid,\u201d Eli said, his voice edged with threat, a death grip on Riggs\u2019 hand. \u201cGet off her.\u201d</p><p>Riggs moved\u2014fast, and then I was looking into Eli\u2019s eyes as he bent down on one knee and hovered over me. He stared, hard, for several seconds, and I knew he was digging in my brain. With a stern look, his gaze traveled over my body, then searched my face. \u201cYeah, I am digging. What the hell\u2019s going on, Riley?\u201d</p><p>Seth squatted down beside me and leaned over. \u201cRi? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Seth.\u201d I sat up. \u201cSeriously. No worries.\u201d</p> <p>Behind my brother stood Phin, Luc, and Josie; behind them, Zetty, Riggs, and the others. They all looked at me as if I\u2019d grown another freaking head. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, glancing at all of them, then back to Eli. I stared silently, frustration and a little anger growing faster by the second. Tucking my foot under my ass, I moved to stand. Eli pushed me back down. In the next second Zetty was standing there, pinching dust from his protective pouch and sprinkling it over me.</p><p>He muttered something in Tibetan.</p><p>\u201cZetty, stop it!\u201d I said, waving my hand in front of my face. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got some bad stuff in you, Riley,\u201d he said in his heavy Nepali accent. \u201cIt needs to come out.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cWell thanks, Zet-Man. I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Zetty glared back, then moved away. Eli was there, doing his share of glaring.</p> <p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said, his frown deepening and his blue eyes growing dark. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>I frowned back. \u201cJesus, Eli. Chill.\u201d</p><p>He continued to stare, waiting for an answer.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cIt was another daydream. Very realistic\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow realistic?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked at him, blocking out everyone else from the room. I focused solely on Eli. \u201cVery. I see a kill. Feel it. As if I\u2019m the killer.\u201d With my thumb and forefinger, I rubbed my closed eyes, digging hard into the sockets, trying to erase the images, the feelings. \u201cI ... feel his emotions, his desires, and they\u2019re so gross\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Victorian Arcos?\u201d Eli asked.</p><p>The fury in his face was almost frightening. \u201cNo,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut he\u2019s male. In the daydream, when I reach out, it\u2019s not my hand but his.\u201d I shook my head and looked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s freaky, and I hate it.\u201d I inhaled. \u201cCan I get up now?\u201d</p> <p>Eli didn\u2019t answer me, but he grasped my hand and pulled me up.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s causing it, Eli?\u201d asked Phin. He ran a hand over his short blond hair and stared at his brother. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, Bro. Something\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>Eli kept silent, his gaze trained on me. \u201cYeah.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like to be bossed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Riley,\u201d Eli said, his stern expression edgy. \u201cI mean it. To my parents\u2019 study. They\u2019 have to know.\u201d</p><p>Phin and Luc were already halfway across the donjon floor. My gaze lit on Seth\u2019, and then on Josie, who stood right next to him. She looked at me, eyes fixed and reading me as though she could see straight through me. She picked up on my apprehension. \u201cIt\u2019ll be cool,\u201d she said with encouragement. \u201cEli\u2019s right. Mother and Papa can help.\u201d</p><p>With Eli\u2019s hand on my elbow, I made my way to the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 study. Phin and Luc had waited. Eli reached around me, caught my gaze and held it, then turned the antique cut-glass knob and pushed open the door. I walked through a mixture of jasmine and the scent of a sweet cigar kicked up by a whirling ceiling fan as I entered the room. In the next second, a breeze grazed my cheek; Phin and Luc were across the room. I hadn\u2019t even seen them move. My gaze lit on Eli\u2019s parents, seated at a large mahogany desk near the window. Elise studied something on the computer\u2019s flat-screen monitor. Gilles leaned over her shoulder, obviously interested.</p><p>\u201cTake the bid up to twenty-five pounds, love,\u201d Gilles said to Elise.</p><p>\u201cAh, and then we\u2019ll wait and snipe,\u201d Elise said, typing in her request. Gilles looked up and smiled at me. \u201cOn eBay. I\u2019ve a penchant for antique pocket watches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d Eli said, his slight French accent catching my attention. \u201cRiley has ... an issue. We need your counsel.\u201d</p><p>Gilles rose and walked to me, stopping no more than a few feet away. His profound stare struck me. \u201cWhat is the matter, ma ch\u00e9rie?\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cDreams, I see,\u201d he said, nodding, before I could answer. \u201cOf kills? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Eli, and he nodded. I continued. \u201cIt\u2019s as if ... I\u2019m him. The killer. And it\u2019s not Victorian Arcos. It\u2019s another male, and I\u2019m seeing through his eyes. I can feel him. He attacks and feeds, but I can\u2019t stop what he does.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI try, but I can\u2019t speak, move, or control his actions. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m ... behind his eyelids.\u201d I looked at Eli\u2019s dad. \u201cI recognized the last victim by her tattoo. It was my work.\u201d</p><p>Gilles stroked his smoothly shaven chin; clear blue eyes the same shocking color as Eli\u2019s regarded me. \u201cYou\u2019ve a vampire\u2019s venom inside you, Riley,\u201d he said. \u201cYet you say it is not Victorian.\u201d His gaze, curious, sought mine. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Gilles frightened me; he didn\u2019t. I trusted him, just as I did Eli. But whenever I was around him, the feeling that I\u2019d snuck and done something wrong and had just been busted overcame me. I\u2019d been caught with Mary Jane stuffed in my locker in eighth grade once, and the school security guard had walked right up and caught me stuffing the plastic baggy in my backpack. He\u2019d dragged me to the principal\u2019s office, and it was that feeling. Gilles Dupr\u00e9 was an extremely profound soul.</p><p>Gilles smiled, clearly amused. He truly loved to read my thoughts. \u201cAgain, ch\u00e9rie. How do you know that it is not Victorian? It can be no other, oui?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ripped Valerian\u2019s heart out myself,\u201d Eli said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI helped Phin burn the rest of his body,\u201d said Luc. \u201cNo way can it be him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat leaves Victorian,\u201d said Phin. He moved to stand next to me, folding his arms over his chest. \u201cYou have only the venom of the Arcoses. Like Papa said, there can be no other.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and looked first at Phin, then at Gilles. \u201cI\u2019ve seen his hand\u2014it\u2019s ... rougher in texture, older skin, leathery. Definitely not Victorian\u2019s young pale skin.\u201d</p><p>Gilles glanced at Elise, then directly at Eli. \u201cThis concerns me, then. My only other guess is that another is projecting himself into you.\u201d He regarded me closely. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously captured another\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissed them off is probably more accurate,\u201d said Luc, and he looked at me. With a flip of his head, his shaggy dark blond hair swept out of his eyes. \u201cCould\u2019ve been any of the newlings,\u201d he said. \u201cOr possibly someone they\u2019ve since turned.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, grasped the bridge of my nose, and swore in Romanian under my breath. \u201cSo what am I supposed to do? Watch innocent people die? Deal?\u201d It\u2019s what I\u2019d done my whole damn life, right? Why stop now?</p><p>The room fell silent for all of five seconds; everyone stared at me. I figured the whole Dupr\u00e9 family had read my inner rant. At this point, I didn\u2019t care anymore. Let\u2019em read.</p><p>\u201cWe find him,\u201d Eli said, that deadly edge back in his voice, his hand going protectively to the small of my back. I shivered. \u201cAnd we kill him.\u201d</p><p>Part Four</p><p>MINDLESS</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows the phenomenon of trying to hold your breath underwater\u2014how at first it\u2019s all right and you can handle it, and then as it gets closer and closer to the time you must breathe, how urgent the need becomes, the lust and hunger to breathe. And then the panic sets in when you begin to think that you won\u2019t be able to breathe\u2014and finally, when you take in air and the anxiety subsides ... that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to be a vampire and need blood.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s journal in</p><p>Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula:</p><p>The Film and the Legend</p><p>\u201cI gotta tell ya\u2014I\u2019ve always thought of myself as a pretty tough Betty. A badass in my own right and proud of it. I\u2019m not afraid of much, and if I am scared, I damn sure won\u2019t announce it\u2014to anyone. Unfortunately, my boyfriend and his entire family take privileges inside my private thoughts and know with certainty what scares me, what turns me on\u2014and what pisses me off. All three of those emotions exist in heavy, intoxicating doses where this mystery bloodsucker is concerned, and the biggest fear I have is not that we won\u2019t be able to stop him, but what it\u2019s doing to Eli. He has become crazy-insane about what it\u2019s doing to me. Heads are gonna roll\u2014and I mean that literally.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>I thought I\u2019d done a pretty fab job of holding it together after the terrors began. I mean, damn\u2014I\u2019d always fallen out in the throes of the terrors in front of someone, surrounded by, well, everyone. Yeah, they bothered me. Yeah, they were awful. And fuck-yeah, I wanted them to stop. The thing is I don\u2019t sleep as much as I used to. Tendencies, you see. So that means my waking hours, when the terrors hit? There\u2019re more of them\u2014more opportunities for me to experience them. They do weird things to a mortal body, those terrors. I\u2019m starting to feel different in a way I can\u2019t explain. Just ... not myself. And when I do sleep, I fall hard, as in coma-sleep. Eli is usually right there. Snooping in my brain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s been on a wicked-dark edge lately that part of me totally digs, and yet part of me totally worries about. I could feel the tension in him; Eli isn\u2019t known for his patience. I mean talk about a friggin\u2019 stick of vampiric dynamite. So unlike his brothers who I know have the same frightening power; they just ... contain it. Luc was so easygoing and laid-back, and Phin? I guess he was pretty much the same way. They had a good grip on their anger, their power. Eli? Ka-pow! All week at the shop, I felt his anger building. He\u2019d done pretty well keeping it contained, but every once in a while, I\u2019d see it; he\u2019d extinguish it quickly. Today, though, he\u2019d had enough. He\u2019d parked his agitated ass right in the waiting area at Inksomnia and glared half the day while pretending to thumb through the tat design albums. Flip a page, glare. Flip a page, glare. Every freaking time I looked over at him. Glaring. At me. WTF? Nyx even noticed, but she thought we were just having a lover\u2019s spat and left it alone. Today was Saturday, and she\u2019d taken my last two clients so I could cut out early enough to get ready for the formal dinner at his parents\u2019. I hurried upstairs. He followed. I felt his negative energy building, growing, festering, like some big, freakish reverse orgasm. The moment we stepped into the apartment, I shot a puzzled Seth a glance and stormed into my bedroom. I walked to the window and rounded on Eli. Ooh. I was fuming.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d I asked angrily. \u201cJesus, Eli,\u201d I said for lack of a better choice of words. \u201cAll week long, something\u2019s been eating at you. What is up?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s stare bore into me, his brows furrowed. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked. Did he really just say nothing? \u201cYou\u2019re freaking kidding me, right? You know\u2014never mind.\u201d No way would I be able to force Eligius Dupr\u00e9 into telling me anything he didn\u2019t want to tell me. Stubbornheaded vampire. I stepped toward him, nearly nose to nose. \u201cWhatever it is that has you so pissed off, deal.\u201d I poked his chest. \u201cChill out, come to grips with it, and don\u2019t ever show your ass in my shop again. You got a problem with me, no matter what it is, talk to me. Privately. Don\u2019t just ... piss and pout about it all week. I can handle whatever, so don\u2019t hold it in and get your balls in a twist stewin\u2019 over it all day. Got it?\u201d I gave him a final glare. \u201cI freakin\u2019 mean that, Eli.\u201d</p><p>The expression on Eli\u2019s face changed very little; but it did change. Subtly. The angry lines between his dark brows ... softened, and the dark flash in his eyes dimmed\u2014somewhat. Yet I knew he wouldn\u2019t budge. Since we were due at his parents\u2019 house, I narrowed my eyes, walked past him, blew it off and got ready. I didn\u2019t like arguing, and I especially didn\u2019t like arguing and then attending a family function where I\u2019d have to pretend I didn\u2019t want to strangle the hosts\u2019 eldest son until his pale face turned blue. (Not that it\u2019d matter\u2014they all took liberties in my head, anyway. They\u2019d probably figure it out soon enough.) So a bad mood now shaded my usually chipper persona. Thanks, Eli. I flung open my closet, dug through the dresses hanging there, and grabbed a long, slinky black halter made of rayon that clung deliciously to my skin. I threw it across the bed and stomped into the bathroom. Eli still stood in the same place I\u2019d left him, staring at me as though I had a friggin\u2019 horn growing out of my forehead. I wished I did. I\u2019d have gorged him with it. As I turned on the hot water, I swore in hot, heated, emotional Romanian\u2014several times. I thought I\u2019d heard a laugh in the bedroom, but I wasn\u2019t sure. I dried my hair and dressed. After choosing a kick-ass choker of black velvet with a green-beaded butterfly in the center made in the 1920\u2019s, a pair of silver hoop earrings, a set of silver bangles, and six-inch-high black pumps, I walked out; Eli\u2019s icy eyes were on me again, and I was pretty positive they remained on me the entire time after that.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Sis,\u201d Seth said, giving me an appreciative look as I walked into the living room,. \u201cYou look sweet.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at my brother. \u201cThanks.\u201d I checked out his black suit and tie. \u201cYou look pretty delicious yourself.\u201d</p><p>Seth glanced down at himself and grinned. \u201cRight? Totally Casino Royale\u2013ish, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah\u2014and Josie will dig it for sure,\u201d I said, raising my eyebrows. Seth\u2019s cheeks turned pink, and I laughed. Then, I glanced at Eli. Yep, still glowering. I shook my head, made sure Chaz had food and water (Seth had taken him out), and we left in the Jeep. I\u2019d thought the brisk drive through the squares with the top off would chill out the glowering Dupr\u00e9. We pulled up to the light and sat, and I glanced over. Nope. Still pouting. We drove on to Monterey Square, and I parked in silence. Inside, Eli disappeared to get ready. I chatted awhile with Elise and Gilles. Elise, in a gorgeous long red strapless dress, silver strappy heels, and her hair coiffed in a smooth ponytail and secured with a gorgeous silver clasp, was completely delighted to have dinner guests. Gilles, in a dark suit, regarded me as he usually did, with depth and precision. The rest of the Dupr\u00e9s were pretty impressive. Luc and Phin, both wearing black Armani suits and ties, looked, as Seth had said, very Casino Royale\u2013ish. Freaking hot was more like it. One with longer hair; the other with short-clipped hair\u2014I was surprised girls weren\u2019t hanging around the gates of the mansion, twenty-four seven.</p><p>\u201cHey, Riley,\u201d Josie said, suddenly appearing behind me. I turned around and, to my surprise, found a stunning young woman in a tie-dyed, floor-length rayon gown with spaghetti straps, her long, loose waves pulled back in a clasp. The purple pumps made her a little taller. Seth stood next to her, his cheeks flushed.</p><p>Josie glanced at Seth. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d she said, then turned back to me. Her expression, always unreadable, fixed directly on me. \u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d I answered with a nod. \u201cMakes you look at least ... eighteen.\u201d</p><p>The smallest of smiles tipped Josie\u2019s mouth. Her blue eyes regarded me. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I said, and I meant it. \u201cEspecially with the way you lined your eyes, sort of sweeping up at the outer corners.\u201d I nodded. \u201cCool. Very Cleopatra-like. I\u2019m gonna have to try that.\u201d</p> <p>Pride flashed Josie\u2019s face. \u201cThanks, Riley.\u201d She glanced at Seth. \u201cWanna go play Xbox until dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, then looked at me and wagged his dark brows. \u201cLater, Sis.\u201d</p><p>I watched my brother hurry off into the game room with a two-hundred-plus-year-old vampiress. Would I ever get used to it?</p><p>\u201cYou look sick, girl,\u201d Luc said, suddenly at my side. \u201cIs there anything you look sucky in?\u201d</p><p>I thought a moment. \u201cSquare dancing dresses?\u201d</p><p>Luc laughed. \u201cI\u2019m picturing it in my head. You still look pretty hot\u2014ruffles and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks hot in what?\u201d Phin said, walking up.</p><p>\u201cSquare dancing dresses,\u201d Luc said, his eyes twinkling.</p> <p>\u201cTotally,\u201d Phin agreed. I just shook my head.</p><p>As I said, Eli\u2019s siblings were laid-back and easygoing.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have someone to protect,\u201d Eli\u2019s voice said, suddenly against my ear. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I met his gaze without words. He rounded on me and stood with his brothers. I promise you, a more striking group of guys did not exist. All three glanced at me. All three\u2014even Eli\u2014smugged up. It was ego city, with testosterone overflowing, even with overly confident, somewhat arrogant vampires.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Eli long, though, to resume his edgy attitude. All through dinner I could feel his tension. Even as I gawked at how absolutely freaking hot he was in a black Armani suit and tie, his unnamed irritation boiled inside him\u2014freaking baby. Men, whether mortal or otherworldly, were just freaking babies. More than once I\u2019d wanted to pick up a jumbo coconut shrimp by its fan tail and knock the holy hell out of Eli with it. Or grab a stalk of pickled asparagus and just ... slap him with it. Every food item became artillery, and if I hadn\u2019t been so pissed at him, I would have laughed at myself. What an idiot I could be. But damn, I couldn\u2019t help it. I hated issues.</p><p>By the end of dinner, I\u2019d actually thought Eli had chillaxed; he carried on a conversation in French with his father (in retrospect I should have suspected something was up with this, because, afterward, Gilles stared at me\u2014a lot) and somewhat joked around with Luc and Phin. In between, though, he gave me deep, intense looks that left me breathless\u2014and wanting to dot his eyes out at the same time. He\u2019d grinned after that thought, and I\u2019d really hoped he\u2019d relax. I should have known better.</p><p>It was just after nine p.m. when we finished. Seth and Josie wanted to jump the buildings on Bay Street, and, since Luc and Phin agreed to go with them, I didn\u2019t see a problem with it. Seth\u2019s tendencies had grown, and I mean fast. He was nearly as quick on his feet as Luc. I\u2019d even thought it might be a good negative energy release for myself and mentioned going, but Eli grasped me by the elbow and leaned close to my ear. \u201cNot tonight,\u201d he said. It was all he said before leading me in hurried silence, past the amused expressions of his parents, his siblings, and mine, to his private apartment upstairs. Had I not possessed a freakish amount of self-confidence, I might have been a little scared. I mean, seriously. Running through my body was scrumptious, mouthwatering although strigoi-tainted, grade-A crack-blood that was highly addictive to vampires, and a vampire, who\u2019d been giving me fiery looks all night, was leading me upstairs to his totally private apartment with one helluva purpose. One would think I\u2019d lost my friggin\u2019 mind.</p><p>I was totally turned on.</p><p>We never made it to his actual apartment.</p><p>Once we were down his wing, the lights dimmed, shadows flickered against the aged brick walls, and Eli\u2019s powerful presence and built-up tension all but suffocated me, closed in on me, wrapped around me like an invisible silky cloak. The farther we walked down the corridor, the darker it became, the more stifling the air, the subtle light diffusing to less than that of a candle. We were in another place, another time. At the end of the hall were the wide double doors leading into Eli\u2019s apartment. The tension overwhelmed me. I jerked to a stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEli,\u201d I said, the sound not as strong as I\u2019d planned.</p><p>In a flash-second, his hands grasped me by the hips and pushed me hard against the wall; he followed me, leaning in close, crowding me. My breath caught in my throat on impact, and I stared into Eli\u2019s icy, angry cerulean eyes. They searched mine with ferocity.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I demanded, trying to shove him. It was like pushing on a concrete wall.</p> <p>\u201cI,\u201d he began, his voice way too steady, \u201cdon\u2019t like sharing. What\u2019s mine is mine alone. And I don\u2019t like being helpless or out of control. Lately I\u2019m both, and, as far as I can see, only two things need to happen: Victorian has to die, and whoever else has crawled inside you has to die.\u201d His fingers dug into my hips, his body pressed against mine. Although his face was cast in gray distorted shadows, his eyes all but glowed as they searched mine; intense, radiant, and livid. \u201cI fucking mean it.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, not so stunned. I\u2019d learned a while back that Eli was more than possessive when it came to me. He was a hothead on top of it. \u201cYou know, anger management class might do you some good, or a little Xanax\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s mouth covered mine, quickly silencing any further words of psychiatric or medical wisdom I might have offered. I didn\u2019t care. My desire for him had been building all night, just as much as his tension had. I grasped his neck and threaded my fingers through his hair, and kissed him back\u2014hard. Our tongues grazed, tangled, and the sensation ignited an intensity of raw need that all but lit the room on fire. I groaned, sucked his bottom lip, kissed him hard again, and shoved Eli around. His back hit the brick wall as hard as mine had. Anger and passion drove me.</p><p>We both struggled for control; it became an involuntary game.</p><p>Neither of us won.</p> <p>Our mouths fused. My fingers clawed at Eli\u2019s coat, pushed it off his shoulders, and it dropped to the floor. Blindly, I fumbled with his tie, and, finally, I loosened it enough to get it off his neck without strangling him. Our breathless moans and desperate kissing filled the otherwise silent corridor like a porn movie, and at the back of my barely reasoning brain I could hear it loudly. It turned me on, and I found myself seeking Eli\u2019s bare skin, almost insane to touch him. I unfastened the buttons on his shirt, pulled the hem from his pants, and dropped it, only to find an undershirt.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I muttered in frustration, and I felt Eli\u2019s smile against my mouth. He broke from our kiss long enough to snatch the thin ribbed shirt over his head and fling it somewhere; then he pulled me against him. As his mouth sought mine again, he dragged his lips slowly, erotically, using his tongue against my bottom lip, then against my teeth; it drugged me. He tasted sweet, like coconut, and that other indescribable, irresistible vampiric thing that was alluring and uniquely Eli. As my hands grazed his flawless skin, over the muscles etched into his chest and lower, into his abdomen, I shuddered at the sensation the friction caused within me. I straddled his leg, mine on either side, and leaned into him, inhaling, tasting, devouring, and he pulled me hard against his thigh. I moaned and ground into him. When his hands left my hips and grasped the length of my dress and slowly lifted it, my breath caught. Finally, we were skinto-skin. His hands raked over my bare thighs, cupped my ass, and pulled me hard against him. Our bodies fit perfectly, touching in all the right places, and my craving for him reached a level of desperation that shocked even me. My mouth moved to his throat, nipping and tasting as my hands pushed between us, grasping his belt and loosening it enough so my hand would fit down the front of his Armani slacks. The bare shaft of hard muscle I found, covered by nothing but velvety skin, made me groan against Eli\u2019s neck. He let out a low chuckle.</p><p>I found myself suddenly flung around, my bare back now digging into the wall, scraping against the rough aged brick, allowing Eli complete control. My mind became total gravy as his hands brushed my skin, over my hips, until his fingers slipped beneath the silky triangle of material that was my thong. Wedging his leg between mine, he shoved my thighs apart and scraped the highly sensitive flesh that throbbed with need. I arched against Eli\u2019s hand, my mind momentarily going blank. Fuck me now, dammit! my inner, primitive, craving-nasty-sex voice screamed without my permission. Maybe that sounds trashy, but good God\u2014I couldn\u2019t help it. Eli makes me mindless-crazy. If I\u2019d had any inhibitions before, they would have been swiftly bludgeoned with Eli\u2019s powerful, sensual touch. He was that potent. I moved my mouth to his ear. \u201cNow,\u201d I half begged, half threatened.</p><p>With both hands on my hips, Eli lifted me to his waist; I wrapped my legs around him and, kissing me, he began to move. I didn\u2019t know where we were going; nor did I care. One second we we\u2019re in the corridor; the next, in his bedroom. He loosened his hold, I slid down his front slowly, and Eli grasped my face, lowered his head, and tasted every inch of my mouth, and when the angle didn\u2019t suit him, he tilted my head. Then his hands left me, found the clasp at my halter strap, and unfastened it. My dress pooled around my ankles, and Eli\u2019s hands covered my breasts. I moaned as pleasure shot through me.</p><p>His lips left mine and moved to my ear, the sensation of his mouth dragging against my skin making me shudder and my cravings increasing to a painful pitch. My fingers dug into his back, my eyes closed, and my head dropped to the side, weightless.</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m more than a good fuck to you, Riley,\u201d he whispered against the shell of my ear. His hands moved to my lower back, then slid over my ass and pulled me tightly against him.</p> <p>The words froze me, and my head snapped up. Amidst the haze of horniness, I stared into Eli\u2019s eyes. I\u2019d regained my senses; yet I could say nothing. We simply stared at each other. I had no way of answering him convincingly, except with my mouth, my body. Words meant nothing. I lifted both of my hands and grasped Eli\u2019s jaw, and I kept my eyes trained on his as I pressed my lips against his. He stood statuelike still as I kissed him, gently, slowly, pouring all of my unstated feelings for him into that one act. Then, I wrapped my arms around his neck and simply hugged him. I buried my face in his neck and snuggled against him. His arms went around me, wrapped completely around me, and pulled me close, just as gently.</p><p>Now will you fuck me?</p><p>Damn. I couldn\u2019t help it. I\u2019m telling you. I. Could. Not. Help. It. The dirty request slipped out of the restraints deep in my brain and into open, vampiric-readable gray matter. Dammit!</p><p>Eli\u2019s body shook against mine, and it was a few seconds before I realized he was laughing. I pulled back and stared into his shadowy face, peered into the depths of his ancient, disturbing eyes, and I knew then he understood me\u2014fully. Then, he lowered his head, pressed his lips to mine, and kissed me.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he said softly. It was the first time he\u2019d said it. I\u2019ll never forget it, although I couldn\u2019t say the words back. Not then, anyway. Hopefully later. He then kissed me deeply as he backed me up until we reached his massive bed. Eli lifted me, kicked off his shoes and the pants that had dropped below his hips, then followed me down into the softness of a white down comforter. Not once taking his gaze from mine, with his forearms, he braced his weight, his body above mine.. Lifting one hand, he smoothed my hair back, traced my brows, the bridge of my nose, and with his thumb, grazed my lips. I saw nothing more than half his face; the other half was swallowed in darkness. The image was intimate, sexy, and Eli exploring my facial features like a blind man became the single most erotic experience I\u2019ve ever had. It sank to my soul, and I felt my insides flutter with excitement. I couldn\u2019t believe someone like Eli belonged to me.</p><p>Slowly, he lowered his head, grazed my lips with his, then moved to my ear. \u201cWatch me,\u201d he whispered erotically, and I felt myself grow wet at his seductive words. \u201cWatch what you do to me, Riley.\u201d He pulled back and stared into my eyes; the possessiveness, the intense longing I saw there rocked me. Without another word, he moved, pushing his hard length fully into me. I was wet and ready and about to absolutely die with need, and his eyes grew dark with desire at contact. I wrapped my legs around his waist and moved with Eli, our bodies and rhythm becoming one, my heart beating enough for the both of us, and the whole while I kept my gaze trained on his. I held on as the orgasm built, strong, intense, until it erupted deep inside me. Its strength finally forced my eyes to close, and my body arched with pleasure against Eli\u2019s as waves crashed over me; over him. Finally, the climax began to descend. As it came to a rest, Eli wrapped his arms and legs around me and encased me completely, and I let him. It was as submissive as I\u2019d ever get\u2014with anyone. Eli wasn\u2019t after submissive, though. I knew what he wanted\u2014the L-word\u2014but I couldn\u2019t give it to him right now. Not that I didn\u2019t feel it, but ... it\u2019s hard to explain. He knew, though, and patiently waited. My feelings for him were greater than for anyone I\u2019d ever encountered, and it scared me. He knew it scared me. I hoped one day it wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>How long we lay there, our bodies wrapped and melded, I had no idea. I\u2019m not even sure when I fell asleep. One minute I was completely relaxed, content, being drugged by the sensation of Eli\u2019s fingers dragging up and down my spine, his intense intimacy unlike anything I\u2019d ever experienced. The next minute, or hour, or however long, I sat up, looked around, dazed and confused. Eli was nowhere, and I was in a strange, unfamiliar place. A church? An old Spanish mission? In ruins, the brick and mortar were covered in vegetation, something wild and out of control like wisteria or ivy, and surrounded by a dense wood. It wasn\u2019t Savannah but somewhere ... else. I was alone. The heavy scent of rain and damp, along with ripened plant life, permeated the ruin, and overhead, the roof was almost completely gone. Nothing but a few old rotted rafters remained, the rest of the gap spindled and webbed with aged vines. It was night, and shots of moonlight breached the porous roof, illuminating the floor in splotchy, distorted, uneven patches. And although I was alone, several lit candles sat clustered together near the front of the ruin, and their flames caused shadows to skip across the brick. In the corner, beneath the only remaining stained glass arch, a long, wide stone bench stretched invitingly. After glancing around and seeing nothing or no one, I noticed how weary my body was, and I picked my way across bracken, sharp-hulled acorns, and scattered pine straw to the bench and sat down. One lone candle flickered in a ruby-colored glass holder on the sill. I pulled up my feet, which were bare, and wrapped my arms around my knees. It was then I noticed I wore nothing more than a white silky slip with satin straps, and it glided smoothly over my bare skin as I moved. I could have been completely naked, the slip was so skimpy, and as it was, I had nothing beneath it, anyway\u2014no panties, no bra. No wonder I was so cold.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRiley,\u201d a voice said.</p><p>I jerked my head toward the voice but saw no one. Adrenaline raced through me; yet my heart pounded slowly. My eyes searched every inch of the ruin, but found nothing.</p><p>Then, the whispers began.</p> <p>Riley, Riley, Riley, Riley ...</p><p>Over and over, my name fell from unseen lips, harsh and intimate at the same time, and I gripped the brick sill of the window and scanned the room. Whispers were everywhere; yet there was no body, no physical voice to connect them. A gnawing sensation of panic crept upon me, and I hated the feeling. I wasn\u2019t scared of anything or anybody, but I\u2019d rather see what was coming at me than cower like some fool by a window. The sense of dread grew, and I knew someone was about to die a horrible death.</p><p>Then, suddenly, as if those particular thoughts beckoned, in the time it took me to involuntarily blink my eyes, he was there\u2014Victorian Arcos.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d he said, smiling, and I immediately knew the whispering voice I\u2019d heard seconds before did not belong to him. \u201cYou came to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a willing participant,\u201d I assured him. \u201cYou brought me here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he said, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cDead positive,\u201d I answered. He moved slowly toward me, and I watched his every step as he seemingly glided over the bracken. His hair, dark and wavy, fell loose to his shoulders, and brown eyes regarded me without blinking. He wore dark jeans and a dark shirt, loosened at the collar. His skin was young and flawless, his lips perfectly shaped, the cut of his jaw that of a vibrant twenty-one-year-old man. A thick vein ran from the side of his neck and disappeared beneath his collar\u2014another sign of youth, vitality. He smiled then, white teeth flashing against an olive complexion, and I knew having me inspect him so thoroughly thrilled him. \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up, sunshine,\u201d I offered. \u201cI just like to know my enemies inside and out.\u201d</p><p>Victorian squatted beside the bench I sat on and traced my jaw with his forefinger. \u201cI am not your enemy,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI am your destiny. And you will know me inside and out. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I flinched. \u201cSorry,\u201d I said, and shifted so my face wasn\u2019t so easily accessible. \u201cI\u2019m not into younger dudes.\u201d I glanced around, hoping to change the subject. \u201cWhere am I and how in hell did I get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it or not, my love, this is your fantasy. Your dream,\u201d he said in a heady Romanian accent, and without my permission, moved closer. I was thrilled and appalled at the same time. \u201cI am honored to be in it. And for the record, you are much, much younger than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a killer,\u201d I accused. \u201cI saw what you did to that girl, in the parking lot, and the one at the bar,\u201d I said, knowing he wasn\u2019t the killer, but I had to know who was. I darkened my expression. \u201cYou make me sick. And don\u2019t kid yourself. You force your way into my dream, just as you force my reactions. I damn sure don\u2019t have them willingly.\u201d</p> <p>A look of puzzlement crossed his features. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Victorian. I\u2019m not an idiot. Like you repeatedly say, your venom is inside me forever. I can see, feel your moves, your kills, feeds, how you terrorize innocents.\u201d I glared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a monster.\u201d</p><p>His puzzlement grew; his brows furrowed into an expression I\u2019d not witnessed before. It was almost believable.</p><p>\u201cI never terrorize, my love,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m anything but a monster. I adore women. I control my feeds, and my victims live.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWith tendencies, of course.\u201d His eyes penetrated me, intense and sincere. \u201cI have mercy, Riley Poe. I swear it. And of course I force my way into your dreams. You\u2019re a hardheaded mortal.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI like that about you. And the chase gives me a hard-on like no other.\u201d</p><p>I ignored his confession and perversion. \u201cThe Dupr\u00e9s paint a very different picture of you and your brother, and I tend to believe them. Not you. I mean, seriously. You did try to suck all my blood out at Bonaventure, or did you forget that?\u201d</p><p>Victorian\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cI could not forget if I tried,\u201d he said gently, his voice even, controlled, seductive, and if I wasn\u2019t mistaken, somewhat remorseful. \u201cBut you are mistaken. I would never have killed you. I would have turned you, yes, and then you\u2019d be mine forever. I am selfish, but I am nothing like my brother.\u201d His eyes scanned my body, regarding me closely, intensely, like a lover\u2019s caress. \u201cI know what you need, what you want and desire, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I desire for you to stop calling me Riley Poe,\u201d I said sarcastically.</p><p>Victorian laughed softly, his eyes trained on mine. \u201cI\u2019ve watched you for far longer than you think, Riley. Since you were a young girl, I\u2019ve known you, desired you.\u201d The muscles in his jaws clenched; then, without warning, a hot, seductive sensation washed over me, uncontrolled, unwanted, insatiable. Victorian didn\u2019t move an inch; yet I felt his hands on me, everywhere, his voice an erotic brush of air against my skin. I wanted to scream in protest. I struggled not to writhe with desire. He easily controlled me with his mind. \u201cYou want my hands on your body, tracing every curve and bit of softness you have,\u201d he said, his words drugging me, and at the same time I felt the sensation of his hands trailing my arm, skimming my collarbone, pushing the satin strap aside, letting it fall over my shoulder. \u201cYou want my mouth on you, my lips following my fingertips,\u201d he whispered. I felt his lips in the hollow of my neck, then across my collarbone, my jaw. I sat, totally frozen, powerless to move as Victorian awakened every sexual sensation he had no right to awaken. Invisible manacles held me hostage as I sat in the window seat, and although I struggled, I could not break free.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me, Riley,\u201d he said, and though he sat stone-still, my slip eased down my breasts as if invisible fingers grasped the silky material and pulled. \u201cI am only obeying your silent command,\u201d he whispered, and warm breath brushed the sensitive peaks as though teasing with his lips. The slide of silk against my thighs as the hem of the slip rose slowly made my insides rush with excitement. I hated it. I wanted it. I tried squeezing my thighs together, but they wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight it, Riley,\u201d Victorian said smoothly. \u201cIt is me you desire, me you long for, me you want to feel deep inside you. Open ... for me.\u201d Invisible fingers dragged over my skin as my slip rose above my hips, and sensations of unwanted pleasure darted my body like needle pricks. I gasped as hot breath brushed between my thighs. \u201cOpen,\u201d he demanded seductively. \u201cYou are so unique, so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, the sound barely above a whisper. I wanted to cry, shout, kick out; I wanted to hurt....</p><p>I wanted to come.</p><p>Warmth, wet and delicious, delved inside me, again and again; I gasped. I lost my breath. \u201cNo!\u201d I sobbed, louder, just before the intensity of climax crashed over me.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>My eyes fluttered open and stared into Eli\u2019s angry, flashing eyes. Confusion webbed my conscious thought, pleasure made my body shudder, and I had to blink several times and look around before I remembered where I was and what was happening. Eli, his arms braced on either side of my hips, stared up from between my thighs. He moved over me, and with his hands he held my head still, forcing me to look at him. We were naked, in his bed, his body covering mine, my senses and nerve endings humming from the sensual caresses from his mouth and his tongue.</p><p>A split second before it hadn\u2019t been Eli.</p><p>All at once, and so fast I didn\u2019t see him move, Eli pushed off me. Looking at him as he stood beside the bed, his face angered, his body rigid, I had a crazy moment of raw adoration. I thought I\u2019d never seen a more beautiful soul than Eligius Dupr\u00e9.</p><p>I hated that he was angry with me. Shame flooded me; ire built, and at that moment I didn\u2019t think I could hate anyone\u2014rather, anything\u2014more than I hated Victorian Arcos, and I was damn tired of his screwing with me. I pulled the sheet up to cover my naked body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry with you,\u201d he said quietly, his voice controlled, totally on edge. He knelt down and grasped my chin, then turned my face toward his, almost painfully. A dangerous fierceness took over his features; gently, he grasped the sheet from my fingers and released the sheet. \u201cNever feel shame,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are powerless, and he is powerful and obsessed with you; you cannot fight him. You will not win, and you will never rid your mind of him. He won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d</p><p>I stared in disbelief. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said incredulously. I pushed up on my elbows, and, unable to say anything, I gaped. No way was he right. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Holding my chin, Eli crept closer, covered my lips with his, and kissed me. It was more than a kiss; it was a brand, a memory of possessiveness I was surely meant to carry until death. The firmness of his lips, the drag of his mouth as he claimed mine, the slow tease with his tongue, made my body quiver, my nerve endings fire, my skin flush with heat. Suddenly, he pulled back and regarded me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Riley Poe,\u201d he said, his voice dark, determined. \u201cAnd while you may not be able to stop Victorian, I can.\u201d His eyes searched mine. \u201cI don\u2019t share. Remember? He has\u2019 to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>Eli moved so fast, my vision saw nothing more than a hazy streak. I leapt from the bed, allowing the sheet to fall to the floor. \u201cEli, wait!\u201d I cried, and I knew panic was close. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>At the door, Eli stopped, and I noticed he\u2019d already changed. Dressed exactly as he had been the first day I saw him through Inksomnia\u2019s storefront window, in worn jeans, a white tee and boots, with a shouldered backpack, he looked like any average badass guy on the street; mysterious, dangerous, not to be messed with. I knew he was all that and much, much more. I also knew his answer before it left his mouth.</p><p>With a look of longing that will haunt me for the rest of my days, I watched Eli\u2019s face change from loving to one of pure determined hatred. \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking kill him.\u201d He turned and moved through the double doors, then stopped. His back remained to me, his posture unyielding, still as death. \u201cWait for me,\u201d he requested quietly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then, he was gone. Within minutes, the rumble of his silverback sounded, idled, and then roared up the street. I stood and listened until the motor faded completely away.</p><p>Eli was going after Victorian. Just like that, up and gone. Really? How would he even know where to look for him? I wanted to beat the hell out of Eli, and it was a helluva lot easier to stay pissed than it was to mope about his leaving. I didn\u2019t have time for that, so pissed seemed the better route for me. After climbing in and out of the shower, I pulled on the dress Eli had so sexily discarded hours before, then grabbed my purse and pumps. At the double doors I paused and glanced over my shoulder at the rumpled bed. The clock read 4:58 a.m. With what seemed an involuntary muscular action, I drew in a deep, long breath, taking in Eli\u2019s scent to litter my lungs, my taste buds, my memory. I knew what he did, he did for me. I also knew, somehow, he wouldn\u2019t find Victorian. Not easily, anyway. The other invading my mind? How could Eli find him if we didn\u2019t even know who he was? Eli had an explosive character. His emotions ran high in everything he did. When he was pissed, he was pissed. When he was happy, he was elated. And when he loved, man, he seriously loved. So it really didn\u2019t surprise me that he\u2019d taken off in an angry cloud of dust to find the two things causing me misery. It didn\u2019t console or take away the edge I already felt inside. Within my rib cage, my heart ached\u2014my fucking heart\u2014and a hole had begun to tear, ragged inside my chest. Who knew what would happen? I hated that it all mattered enough to me that I felt pain. Angry, I closed my eyes briefly, breathed, then shut the doors and started down the corridor.</p><p>Philippe Moreau, the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 butler, stood in the kitchen, a white cup and saucer in his hand, and a kettle on the stovetop. Dressed in a long navy robe and slippers, he turned at my entrance. Aged eyes regarded the dragons inked into my arms, the angel wing at the corner of my eye, and then, met my gaze full on. \u201cWill you have tea, Ms. Poe?\u201d he asked, in a very proper and French manner.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks, Philippe,\u201d I answered, and headed to the door, where I paused. \u201cEli\u2019s gone,\u201d I said, not really knowing why I did.</p><p>\u201cHe will return,\u201d Philippe said comfortingly, as though he knew.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cMy brother?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe is in the game room with the others,\u201d Philippe answered. \u201cShall I call for him?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll call later.\u201d No sense in dragging Seth home on a Sunday morning and making him suffer my badass mood. I had supplies to order for Inksomnia, some designs to go over with Nyx later, and a few things to pick up from the store\u2014a typical Sunday. Seth might as well stay with Josie and the guys and have a little fun. \u201cLater, Philippe,\u201d I said, then pushed out of the kitchen\u2019s screen door and into Savannah\u2019s early morning.</p> <p>The sun wasn\u2019t up yet, but a dim, hazy glow hung in the air as I made my way to the Jeep. Thick fog wafted over Monterey Square and slipped through the live oaks, swallowing the black iron streetlamps along the walkway. Barefoot, I tossed my pumps and purse into the passenger side of the Jeep.</p><p>And into the lap of a body that wasn\u2019t there a half breath ago.</p><p>\u201cWhere ya goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I jumped and sucked in a breath. Luc grinned, and I glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, Dupr\u00e9. God. You\u2019re gonna give me a freaking heart attack.\u201d I slipped behind the wheel.</p><p>He grinned wider. \u201cI know CPR. I\u2019d save you. So? Where?\u201d</p><p>I looked straight ahead. \u201cHome. I got a business to run, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt five a.m.?\u201d</p><p>I jammed the keys into the ignition, but before I could start the Jeep, Luc\u2019s hand stilled mine. I sighed. \u201cHe left.\u201d I glanced at him.</p><p>A slight breeze caught his crazy hair and tossed it across his forehead. He pushed it back and met my gaze in the dim light. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI know. He asked me to ride along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter anymore.\u201d I turned the Jeep\u2019s engine over. \u201cI\u2019m not a helpless mortal, Luc. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Luc grinned. \u201cHe said you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I answered, glancing at him, \u201cSeth will be with me this time. And as far as we can tell, there is no threat close by, right? The newlings have moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth is here. And the newlings have moved on. For now.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cPreacher is right next door. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I pointed. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p> <p>Luc didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a girlfriend or something?\u201d I asked, knowing full well he did not. \u201cSeriously dude\u2014you\u2019ve gotta move out of your parents\u2019 house, or no decent chick will have anything to do with you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat reminds me. I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about Nyx. Is she involved?\u201d</p><p>I put the Jeep in reverse. \u201cNo way, Dupr\u00e9. I wouldn\u2019t want her mixed up in all of this.\u201d</p><p>Luc leapt out and was at my door before I could blink. He met my gaze with a sincere one. \u201cWould you have held back from Eli, had you known what you know now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I didn\u2019t even have to think about it.</p><p>Luc smiled and pushed off the door. The yard lamp cast a yellow glow down on him, and I studied the severe similarities between Luc and Eli. Other than the dark blond, crazy hair, they looked very much alike\u2014same disturbing eyes, same cut of jaw, same mouth. Well, almost the same mouth. \u201cYour mind, then, is open game for me. That way I\u2019ll know if you\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said, grinning, and gave a confident nod. \u201cYeah. I think I like this plan better, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and glanced over my shoulder to back out. \u201cI hate this plan. I think this plan sucks.\u201d</p><p>Luc laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s either this plan, or the one where I come babysit you full-time.\u201d</p><p>I scowled. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he said, grinning. I\u2019ll drop by later. And don\u2019t worry about Seth. He\u2019s cool. And Riley,\u201d he said, his face serious. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back. Soon.\u201d</p><p>Turning the Jeep, I rounded the graveled circle drive by the kitchen entrance and pulled up next to Luc. \u201cI know he will. And seriously, thanks. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob.\u201d He leaned over and tapped my temple with a forefinger. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a comfort,\u201d I said, gave a half-forced grin, and pulled out into the square. Deciding to get myself together and grab a coffee, I headed to Skidaway to the original Krispy Kreme, where I got in a fairly short line of die-hard Kremers who wanted that first, fresh, hot batch of doughnuts of the morning. Being the JFJ (junk food junkie) that I am, I ordered a dozen regular glazed (they melt in your mouth) and a large coffee with cream and sugar, then headed back home. I listened to the relative silence of early Sunday morning in Savannah as I made my way back to Inksomnia. Eli had started teaching me how to concentrate, to filter out all the extra sounds I could now hear, and hone in on just my immediate surroundings by focusing on one single sound. I wasn\u2019t totally good at it yet, but at least now I wasn\u2019t going nuts. When he first taught me, I had to close my eyes, breathe deeply, and concentrate so hard that my brain hurt. It was like being in a large convention room with two thousand people, all of them droning. Finally, I did it, and it was a relief. It wasn\u2019t easy to turn on and off, and sometimes it took me a few minutes to achieve control, but I was getting better, and I could now do it without squeezing my eyes shut. I mean, Jesus. It was kinda funny at first, but I quickly grew sick of hearing people humping and moaning all the friggin\u2019 time. God, they were having sex everywhere. I felt trapped in a porn dream. So this morning, after I shut out the other unwanted noises, I found everything was pretty calm, as it used to be before I had two strigoi bloodsuckers try to drain my life force. Light traffic; somewhere, a dog barking its head off, and, in the distance, a semitruck grinding its gears and chugging along the bypass\u2014these were normal sounds.</p><p>I should have realized this was the beginning of a sonot-normal day.</p><p>By the time I pulled onto the merchant\u2019s drive and parked the Jeep behind Inksomnia, it was a few minutes after six a.m. Preacher and Estelle\u2019s light in the kitchen flickered on, so I crossed the cobbles to their back door. The haze was brighter outside now, but the sun still hadn\u2019t cracked over the city. I knocked lightly, and in seconds Preacher came to the door. The beam of light that shined behind him revealed his usual long-sleeved plaid shirt tucked neatly into a pair of worn dungarees and a big smile. He and Estelle always got up early, so I knew I wasn\u2019t intruding. When his gaze lit on the Krispy Kreme box, the smile grew.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, dat\u2019s my girl right dere,\u201d he said, then kissed my cheek and pulled me into the small foyer. \u201cWas cravin\u2019 dem tings earlier. Almost went out myself to get dem.\u201d He lifted a brow. \u201cDon\u2019t let your grandmodder see \u2019em. She says da sugar makes me act all crazy.\u201d He chuckled softly.</p><p>\u201cI heard dat, ole man,\u201d Estelle hollered from the kitchen. \u201cRiley Poe, you git in here and bring dem tings wit you. Dat ole man acts crazy widdout da sugar, dat\u2019s right. Sugar makes him crazier.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Preacher. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d I flipped open the box. Preacher lifted a doughnut out and in two bites had it gone. I shook my head, grabbed one myself, took a bite, and headed for the kitchen while my surrogate grandfather licked his fingers. I set the box on the table and sat down.</p><p>\u201cI hope you left room in dat bottomless pit of a stomach for some magic,\u201d Estelle said with a fake scowl, inclining her head toward the simmering pot of tea on the burner. She grinned and glanced at the doughnut box. \u201cYou save me one now, dat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd yes, ma\u2019am, I have plenty of room.\u201d</p><p>Estelle bustled over, wearing a hot pink Da Plat Eye T-shirt and a multicolored brush skirt, with a knotted head wrap to match. She smelled fresh, like Dove soap and something ... herbal from the shop. Satin ebony skin shined in stark contrast to her white smile. \u201cDrink up, Riley Poe. Don\u2019t want dem Dupr\u00e9s lookin\u2019 at you like you was a pork chop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head and smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think they like me as much anymore,\u201d I said, and shrugged at the questioning look on my surrogate grandmother\u2019s face. \u201cTough meat.\u201d</p><p>Estelle stared for a second, then burst into laughter, shaking her head. \u201cYou crazy white painted girl, dat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at Preacher.</p> <p>He did not return the cheer.</p><p>When Estelle left the kitchen, he leaned over the table and looked hard at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong wit you, girl?\u201d</p><p>I met his stare. I could never get anything past Preacher. \u201cEli left. He\u2019s going to kill Victorian. And I guess try to find the other one.\u201d</p><p>Preacher took a sip of steaming coffee and stared at me over the rim of his cup. \u201cIf he can find him, anyway. Dat Arcos boy is slippery.\u201d He set the cup down. \u201cAnd I ain\u2019t too sure he\u2019s as bad as his brodder was.\u201d With a long, bony forefinger, he rubbed his jaw. \u201cSometimes, family makes a person do crazy tings, yeah? And he sure has it bad for you, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>The memory of Victorian\u2019s recent words rushed through my head. \u201cHe ... said he\u2019s known me for a long time, Preacher. As in from when I was a kid.\u201d I looked hard at him. \u201cHow can that be?\u201d</p> <p>Preacher flicked something from his sleeve, rubbed his gnarled knuckle, then raised his head to look at me. \u201cMaybe he been watchin\u2019 you from da hell stone all dis time,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI know dat when dey was entombed, dere powers was stripped, and dey was cursed. Dey couldn\u2019t smell your blood, couldn\u2019t crave. But maybe dey could see, hear. He must\u2019ve picked up on you somehow, dat\u2019s right.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cMight be why he wants you so powerful. Maybe he\u2019s been knowin\u2019 you for a long time, girl.\u201d</p><p>Victorian Arcos really did love me? \u201cThat\u2019s ... weird.\u201d</p><p>Preacher laughed softly. \u201cOnly you would say dat, Grandchild.\u201d He grasped my hands between his dark leathery ones. \u201cYou watch yourself, baby, and I mean dat. Make sure your brodder stays wit you. And if you want Jack and Tuba to stay\u2014\u201d</p><p>I smiled and shook my head. \u201cNo, Preach\u2014it\u2019s fine. Really,\u201d I assured him. \u201cBut if things get crazy, I\u2019ll let you know. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHrumph,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cYou always did have dat hard head on ya. Don\u2019t be shamed to ask for help, Riley Poe.\u201d He rose and kissed my cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll take a stick to dat backside, and I mean dat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I promise,\u201d I said, thinking it funny that Preacher had never taken a stick to my backside. \u201cI love you,\u201d I said, rose, and hugged him.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, girl,\u201d he said, and pushed a small sachet into my hand. I glanced down. It was coarse burlap, the size of a golf ball, and filled with ... something. He looked at me gravely. \u201cSprinkle it outside your apartment door and all da windows,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cDo it tonight, before you go to bed.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d Hell only knew what was in the sachet.</p><p>Estelle bustled back into the kitchen as I was leaving. \u201cYou want some crabs, Riley Poe? Capote bringin\u2019 dem later on. He an\u2019 Buck out dere on da Vernon right now pullin\u2019 traps, dat\u2019s right. I\u2019m makin\u2019 some hush puppies, too.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. The Vernon was a brackish saltwater river that ran close to Skidaway Island and emptied into the sound, and Capote, when not\u2019 playing his sax, was out in the mouth of one of hundreds of creeks, crabbing with old Buck. And Estelle made the best hush puppies on the East Coast. \u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ll come by later.\u201d I kissed my dark grandmother good-bye, left several doughnuts on a plate for them, grabbed the remainder of the box, and left.</p><p>At the time, I didn\u2019t realize it, but soon I\u2019d learn that nothing as simple as Savannah blue crabs, Gullah hush puppies, and Krispy Kreme doughnuts would ever grace my life again. But it took the rest of the afternoon to figure it out. The whole while, Eligius Dupr\u00e9 remained in my head. I\u2019d be willing to bet a month\u2019s pay he did it on purpose. Of course, he wasn\u2019t the easiest guy to forget. I already missed him.</p><p>After taking Chaz for a walk, I loaded my iPod into the home unit, selected Sevendust, and spent my morning cleaning the apartment, tidying up the shop, and ordering supplies online while jammin\u2019 to \u201cUnraveling\u201d and \u201cRide Insane.\u201d It was a cool freaking band, and for a while it put out of my head Eli Dupr\u00e9 and the heat and emotions he stirred within me. I cranked up the volume, hoped Bhing from SoHo Boutique next door wasn\u2019t too irritated with the music, and rocked out. She was usually pretty cool about things like that, and for the most part, I didn\u2019t abuse it. Like, I didn\u2019t crank the music if it was too early or too late. This was the middle of the day, so I felt okay about it. The pounding hummed through my body, soothed, settled me. That was what fantastic tunes did to me. The music put me into the groove, and soon my bad mood had evaporated.</p><p>I checked my business e-mail and discovered a special on Skin Candy ink. Since it was my favorite brand, I stocked up. I also ordered another load of Inksomnia tourist T-shirts. I confirmed my appearance and temporary shop at a tattoo convention in November, went over my scheduled appointments, and studied the descriptions I\u2019d drawn on plastic wrap (I hold it to the client\u2019s desired body part chosen for the person\u2019s art and then draw a rough sketch to the contour of the person\u2019s shape) of requests the clients had left. One girl, a nurse at St. Joseph\u2019s, had asked for a dragon/flower combination. She wanted a feminine yet traditional dragon. I sketched the head of a dragon whose body wound around and turned into swirly vines and flowers. By the time Nyx arrived at four p.m., I\u2019d settled onto the floor with my sketch pad. Nyx joined me, and together we hammered out some pretty sick designs. Several hours passed. Seth called to say he, Riggs, the Dupr\u00e9s, and Zetty were doing a little training and would be home around ten p.m. or so. I said fine. So after Nyx and I ran next door for crabs and hush puppies at Preacher\u2019s, we settled back down with our designs. It was after eight p.m. Chevelle\u2019s \u201cSleep Apnea\u201d played quietly (as quietly as Chevelle could play) in the home unit, and Nyx and I slipped into artist mode.</p><p>\u201cThat one is going to take at least two sittings,\u201d Nyx finally said, leaning over the design I\u2019d drawn for a girl of a Japanese cherry tree, with different-sized blossoms sprouting all over the spindly branches. It was a pretty large project that stretched from the thigh, up the rib cage, and over one shoulder.</p> <p>I glanced at my friend. Nyx wore her pigtails stuffed through side holes of a black and white striped skully, a black Iron Maiden T-shirt, and a pair of black jeggings and clunky Mary Janes. She scrunched her nose and peered at me with those huge, blue expressive Nyx eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t ya think?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, then froze. First, the fine hairs on the back of my neck rose. Chaz\u2019s frantic yelp broke through my subconscious, and I leapt up. Second, a cold, frigid sensation crept over me. Third, my body jerked, totally on alert, and I scanned the living room. I\u2019d toned my superhearing down so much that I\u2019d not been paying attention as I should have. I\u2019d definitely have to work on that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Nyx asked, then followed my actions and glanced nervously around the living room. \u201cDid you hear something?\u201d</p><p>Chaz\u2019s growl, then high-pitched yelp met my ears.</p><p>\u201cShe definitely heard something,\u201d a voice said from the darkened hallway, coming from my bedroom. \u201cDidn\u2019t ya, babe?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, and three young male vampires stood in my apartment.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even heard them enter.</p><p>Too bad I hadn\u2019t thought to sprinkle Preacher\u2019s magic dust.</p><p>I jumped up. As I stared at the speaker\u2019s youthful face, positive I didn\u2019t recognize him, my hand eased down the front of my baggy jeans to the concealed silver blade strapped neatly against my thigh. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do to my fuckin\u2019 dog, asshole?\u201d</p><p>And in the very next split second, Nyx\u2019s scream reverberated off my apartment walls as one of them grabbed my best friend by the throat.</p><p>Part Five</p><p>MERCILESS</p><p>\u201cDark, dark! The horror of darkness, like a shroud, wraps me and bears me on through mist and cloud.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Sophocles, Oedipus Rex</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pissed now. It\u2019s one thing to fuck with me,</p><p>but fuck with my loved ones? My best friend?</p><p>My dog? Hell and no. I might be more arro-</p><p>gant than what\u2019s good for me, but arrogance</p><p>might be what\u2019s keeping me strong. Either that</p><p>or I\u2019m just freaking ignorant. Whichever one</p><p>it is, I don\u2019t care. I can kick serious ass now,</p><p>and I can do it without Eli\u2019s help. Good thing,</p><p>too, because he\u2019s long gone. Like it or not, I\u2019m</p><p>not fully mortal anymore, so why not use my</p><p>tendencies to the fullest? You can bet your ass</p><p>I won\u2019t sit around waiting to be rescued like</p><p>some weak little somethin\u2019-somethin\u2019. I got</p><p>shit to do, people to see, and vamps to slay\u2014</p><p>all while running a goddamn business. Yeah,</p><p>I\u2019m pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>Pure silver blades do nasty things to vampires.</p><p>After this was over, I\u2019d stash them all around my apartment.</p><p>Nyx\u2019s scream died in her throat as the newling\u2014a stocky blond guy about twenty-three years old\u2014released her and dropped her to the ground. The blade I\u2019d thrown at him lay buried to the hilt, straight through the pleather jacket he wore, directly into his heart. His opaque stare dulled as his body seized and contracted, and a painful gurgling emerged from his throat. Slowly, his fangs began to retract, and some white gooey stuff began to leak from his eyes and mouth. That was all I noticed, because the other two newlings dove toward me. I reacted.</p><p>In one leap, I fell onto the dying vampire, yanked the blade from his chest, crouched and leapt high, right at the two rushing me. In midair, I pulled my knees up to my chest, planted my feet against the rib cage of one, and pushed hard; he flew across the room and landed on an end table, shattering my favorite stain glass frame and falling against the wall. I plunged the blade into the other\u2019s heart. He fell to the floor, writhing and seizing. I didn\u2019t want to yank the blade out too soon, so I landed in a crouched position, my weight resting on my thighs, and faced the remaining vampire. He\u2019d leapt to his feet and now crouched, waiting to pounce on me. He was older, about my age. I could tell he was not a new vamp; while his eyes were cloudy, insanely crazed, and vicious, I knew he was more experienced than the others. He wanted blood\u2014mine or Nyx\u2019s; it didn\u2019t matter. And he had the patience to get it. I could hear my own heart, slow, sluggish, and Nyx\u2019s beating a million times per minute like a hummingbird\u2019s. She was terrified\u2014so intensely that I could smell the scent of fear rolling off her body in the form of sweat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRiley,\u201d Nyx said, as if she\u2019d heard me thinking about her, lightly, barely audible, just a whisper, petrified.</p><p>I glanced at her; a fraction of a second. It was the distraction the vamp was waiting for.</p><p>He leapt and had me on my back in less time than it took to blink. The air whooshed from my lungs, and Nyx screamed again. With my arms pinned to my sides, I could do little more than stare up at my captor\u2019s face. With distorted, gross, white skin with an exaggerated wide mouth and sharp fangs dropping from his gums, he was ... horrifying, and barely recognizable as ever being human. His opaque gaze was fixed on the pulse at my throat. \u201cReady to die, bitch?\u201d he said, his voice low, not human, determined.</p> <p>\u201cGrab the knife, Nyx,\u201d I commanded gently, slowly, \u201cfrom the other one. Now.\u201d</p><p>So entranced was the bloodsucker straddling me that he didn\u2019t even realize what I was trying to do. But Nyx was in shock and terrified. I knew before the words left my mouth that she wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. I couldn\u2019t blame her. She must be freaked out as hell.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered, then sobbed.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wait. I inched my fingers to the pocket of my jeans, reaching for the sachet Preacher had given me earlier. Maybe the hoodoo powder would burn him enough that I could get him off me. The newling cocked his head, narrowed his milky eyes, and lunged at my throat.</p><p>My mouth opened; I sucked in a breath. I didn\u2019t even have time to scream.</p> <p>A silver blade whipped by my face and was just ... suddenly there, buried in the vampire\u2019s chest; a worn black Conversed foot shoved him backward off me. He landed with a thud against the wall and began to seize, gurgle, convulse. I turned away and stared up and into the troubled green eyes of my baby brother. He extended a hand. I grasped it, and he pulled me up.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call? From inside your head? Luc would\u2019ve heard.\u201d he said. Worry and anger sat etched into the lines on his forehead. \u201cWhy, Riley?\u201d He pulled me into an embrace and squeezed me really hard. \u201cThey could have killed you and Nyx.\u201d</p><p>Nyx.</p><p>I glanced over Seth\u2019s shoulder and found her staring dead at me; blue eyes wide, horrified, her face drawn, even paler than usual. She\u2019d backed against the wall, far from the dead/dying vampires, far from Seth, from the Dupr\u00e9s.</p><p>Far from me.</p><p>\u201cNyx,\u201d I said, pushing out of Seth\u2019s arms.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nyx said, and held up a hand. \u201cYou ... stay away,\u201d she said, sobbing and trying to back up farther. \u201cAll of you stay away.\u201d She glanced hesitantly around the room, her face revealing absolute horror, and she began to inch along the wall, looking for a way out. \u201cI\u2019 have to go,\u201d she mumbled, her voice trembling, to no one in particular. She sounded in the early stages of good old-fashioned hysteria. I totally didn\u2019t blame her, but it saddened me just the same. I so badly didn\u2019t want her involved in this hell. I knew she\u2019d come around, and that we\u2019d have to tell what had happened, what was going on, etc. But I hated to. It was then I noticed Riggs and Zetty in the room. They both regarded me. Zetty gave a curt nod.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Riley?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Zetty. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Luc said to Nyx, gently but firmly, grasping her arm when she resisted. Nyx stared up at him, and I\u2019m not sure if he put the vampire whammy on her or what, but she nodded and allowed him to guide her to the door. Thankfully, Luc steered her way around what little was left of the corpses on my living room floor. At the door, he looked over his shoulder at me. \u201cI\u2019ve got this, Riley,\u201d he said, and I nodded. He walked a trembling Nyx out of my apartment. Her trembling and fast-beating heart resonated inside my ears. Pushing my thumb and forefinger into my temples, I swore in Romanian. This freaking sucked. Suddenly, noises infiltrated my brain, and the murmurings and shouts and cries and horns blasting bounded within me. I concentrated, hard. Some of the sounds retracted, at least enough for me to think. That unusual, unnamed feeling began to grow inside me again. I wished to hell I knew what it was. It made me anxious. Edgy. Angry.</p><p>And as Nyx and Luc walked out, Preacher walked in. He stood in the doorway, glaring. He reminded me slightly of Eli.</p><p>\u201cRi, are you okay?\u201d Seth said again, holding my arms in his firm grip. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>I turned to him. His green eyes were rimmed with worry. \u201cYeah, Bro, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I hugged him tight. \u201cChaz\u2014I think he\u2019s hurt. Off my balcony\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Seth ran out of the apartment, Josie fast on his heels.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you took out the other two alone,\u201d Phin said, squatting beside one of the now-shriveled bodies\u2014barely more than a little pile of skeletal dust\u2014and shaking his head. He rubbed his jaw and muttered his favorite slang. \u201cSack ray blue.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cDo you recognize them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answered, and gave the piles a furtive glance. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re going to help me get that junk out of my apartment.\u201d</p><p>Phin gave me a smile. \u201cAbsolutely. Riggs, Zetty, you guys come with me,\u201d he said, and turned to Preacher. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Seth and Josie walked in. Seth had Chaz in his arms. My heart stopped, and I moved to him. He lifted his head and whined the moment my hand touched him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d Seth said, looking at me. \u201cHe was walking in the grass by the river when I found him. Wasn\u2019t limping or anything. Probably just shaken up. I\u2019ll feed him,\u201d he said, and he set Chaz down. His backside wagged and he licked my hand. I squatted down and ran my hand over his body, and he licked my face. Relief washed over me. He didn\u2019t flinch with pain or anything.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be okay, boy?\u201d I asked in doggy talk. Chaz licked me again and looked hard at me with his allknowing doggy eyes. Such a stoic guy\u2014even if he was hurt, he probably wouldn\u2019t show it. I\u2019d get him checked out in the morning, just in case.</p><p>\u201cCome on, boy, let\u2019s eat,\u201d Seth said, and more slowly than usual, Chaz walked to the kitchen, wagging.</p><p>\u201cYou got sick moves for a mostly mortal,\u201d Josie said, suddenly at my side. Her expressions never swayed severely one way or the other; but you always knew she spoke the truth. With wide cerulean eyes and long light brown waves naturally streaked with blond, she studied me, weighed and evaluated me, all in the span of about three seconds. She looked like an average teen, but the wisdom in the depths of her gaze said otherwise. The very corner of her mouth lifted into what most wouldn\u2019t recognize as a grin. I did. It was a complimentary grin. \u201cI\u2019m wicked glad you made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I replied, and slid a glance to Preacher. \u201cSo am I.\u201d Crossing my arms over my chest, I moved toward my grandfather. He stared down at me, emotions evident only in his dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t sense dem?\u201d Preacher said quietly.</p><p>I shook my head and shoved my hands through my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wonder how Ned didn\u2019t sense them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Josie offered. \u201cThat\u2019s why we came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost too late,\u201d said my brother, who\u2019d moved to stand close to me again. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, Ri. Something\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed\u2019s on his way,\u201d Josie said, pushing her cell into the back pocket of her skinny jeans. I hadn\u2019t even noticed her calling him. \u201cHe thinks something\u2019s up, too. Says he didn\u2019t sense them until they were already here. Totally unlike Ned.\u201d</p><p>My heart jumped. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good,\u201d I said, then looked at Preacher. \u201cWhat am I going to do about Nyx?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe saw everyting den?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, and it wasn\u2019t pretty,\u201d I answered, and shoved my hands into my pockets. Inside one I felt the sachet Preacher had given me earlier, and I wrapped my fingers around it. \u201cShe was in total shock. One of them had her by the throat and lifted her off the floor.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cHer eyes, Preacher\u2014I\u2019ve never seen someone so totally freaked out and scared. She looked at me as if I were a monster.\u201d I looked at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you have some sort of ... something you can give her? Make her forget?\u201d Certainly my Gullah-hoodoo-root doctor-conjuring grandfather could concoct some sort of hocuspocus to brainwash my best friend.</p><p>One of Preacher\u2019s brows lifted as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cGuess not,\u201d I muttered, then looked up as Phin, Riggs, and Zetty came through the door. Zetty, wearing long baggy black shorts, a black T-shirt, and a gold and red braided traditional Nepal vest, stared hard at me. His long black braid hung to his waist.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have time to call for help,\u201d I said, addressing his silent scolding. \u201cI was just as surprised by them as Ned. Plus I had my hearing turned way down. Won\u2019t happen again. So chill.\u201d I gave the big Tibetan a slight smile. \u201cAnd thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some good ass-kickin\u2019, though,\u201d Riggs said as he passed by. \u201cPretty decent for a babe.\u201d</p><p>I could do little more than roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOnce dese boys git rid of dat stuff,\u201d Preacher said, inclining his head to the piles of vamp dust on my floor, \u201cbring it to me. Den you and dat long-haired Dupr\u00e9 boy bring Nyx over to da house. Togedder we will talk to her. Make tings right.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWhat are you going to do until?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFix my house right so my woman is safe. Den I\u2019ll do yours and your brodder\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I hugged my grandfather. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a little while.\u201d</p><p>Preacher patted my back. \u201cDat\u2019s right, child. In a while.\u201d Without another word, he left. I knew that \u201cfix my house right\u201d meant Preacher was about to do some major conjuring and hoodooing to safeguard his house and mine against sneaky vampires. Preacher held his emotions well; I could tell how it had worried him to know three newlings had waltzed right into my apartment and attacked without warning. It scared him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It pissed me off.</p><p>I watched Phin, Zetty, Riggs, and Seth sweep the piles of vamp remains into, no lie, ziplock freezer bags, take some cleaner to the spot beneath the dust, and then sprinkle something over the whole area. No doubt Preacher had given it to them, and I was glad for it. I couldn\u2019t tell you what in hell Preacher was going to do with newling dust, and I wasn\u2019t convinced I wanted to know myself. I was not positive I\u2019d ever sit on my living room floor again and not think about the gruesome death the vamps had died. I shuddered. Yeah, so I guess in the end, it freaks me out a little. Go figure. What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.</p><p>Phin rose, his blue gaze seeking mine. \u201cEli isn\u2019t going to be happy.\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged, walked to the broom closet, retrieved my small broom and dustpan, and walked to the stained glass frame shattered on my floor. I knelt and picked it up, the picture bent inside. Running a thumb over the surface, I smoothed the aged photo paper, the smiling face of my mother with me leaning against her and baby Seth in her arms staring back at me. Emotion caught in my throat, and I shook my head to clear it away. \u201cEli\u2019s not here, so I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so angry at him?\u201d Phin asked, crouching and ducking his head to hold my gaze.</p><p>I met it with fury. \u201cI\u2019m not angry, Phin. I\u2019m pissed. He left, not because my life was in danger but because he is jealous of Victorian, which is really stupid since he isn\u2019t anywhere near me. He comes into my dreams and that\u2019s all he has. It\u2019s fake. Phony. Not really happening. I didn\u2019t ask Eli to leave, and I think it sucks that he did so on his own.\u201d I picked up a broken shard of frame. I was freaking sick of people in my life just ... leaving me. I felt like the only person I\u2019d ever be able to fully count on was Preacher.</p><p>A small smile tipped the corner of Phin\u2019s mouth. \u201cTrust me, Riley,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what you mean to Eli. Hell yeah, you can count on him. And hell yeah, all this does suck, but you know my brother. Noggin of steel. No one, save Papa, tells him what to do. Besides, you\u2019ve no idea what Victorian Arcos is capable of. He may seem harmless, but trust me. He\u2019s not. And Eli takes no chances on what\u2019s his.\u201d His gaze leveled. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>On what\u2019s his.</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cI understand. Still pisses me off, though. You can see now that I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly,\u201d he added, and then he rose. I watched him walk the room with his plain black tee, jeans, boots ... He moved intently through the apartment, the muscle in his jaw flexing. I knew he was ticked about the whole thing, too. But Phin handled things way differently than Eli did. They looked a lot alike but had totally different personalities.</p><p>I finished sweeping the broken frame, stood, and tossed it into the trash. \u201cAre you in contact with him?\u201d I glanced over at Chaz, who lay curled up by the window, dozing.</p><p>Phin nodded. \u201cOf course. He\u2019s on his way back.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd yeah, he found Victorian. Found out something interesting. I\u2019ll catch you up in a few.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, all of that surprised me. But my thoughts and surprise were interrupted by the Geek Patrol.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, dudes, dudettes\u2014gnarly business goin\u2019 on,\u201d Ned Gillespie said from the doorway. Chaz lifted his head and let out a bark.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, boy,\u201d I soothed, and Chaz laid his head back down.</p><p>Dressed in skinny jeans, Converses, and a white T-shirt with SUGAR SHACK printed in red across the front, Ned held his hand to his forehead as he stepped into the living room and looked around. His crazy brown hair, tipped with blond stood every which way. His gaze lit on Josie, and his cheeks turned red. \u201cHey, Josephine. Lookin\u2019 sweet.\u201d I\u2019d almost forgotten they used to be superclose.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThanks, Ned. You, too.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and glanced at Phin. \u201cThought the bloodsucker radar in my noggin was goin\u2019 out or something, but it\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Phin asked.</p><p>Ned\u2019s expression turned serious. \u201cRomanian hocuspocus, dude. Serious weirdicus.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cGlad you made it out okay, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThanks, Ned. So what kind of magic? Like a spell?\u201d Even knowing what I knew about hoodoo and vampires, the question sounded stupid when said aloud. I wondered if I\u2019d ever get used to things.</p><p>\u201cNot sure, babe. Definitely Romanian, though. After I made the vamp alert 911 to Phin here, I was like, blown away.\u201d He gave a short laugh of uncertainty. \u201cI mean, damn\u2014how\u2019d they shimmy under my radar? I should\u2019ve picked them off long before their soulless selves hit the streets of Savannah.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cCould\u2019ve been bad, man. Could\u2019ve been really bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you find?\u201d Phin asked, leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cIn one of my old tomes I read that some bloodsuckers can slip past detectors\u201d\u2014he glanced at me, pressing his fingertips to his chest\u2014\u201cthat\u2019d be me\u201d\u2014he turned back to Phin\u2014\u201cand attack without warning. Depending on their point of vampiric origin, it could be a spell, or maybe a wicked ingestion, or something they spread on their skin.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cImpossible to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think Romanian?\u201d Phin asked.</p><p>Ned nodded and rubbed his jaw thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing concrete. It was more my ... uncanny sense of knowing,\u201d he replied. \u201cAs soon as I picked up their scent, I thought, Damn. Romanian. I guess I smelled them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do Romanian vamps smell worse than other vamps?\u201d asked Riggs.</p><p>Ned narrowed his eyes. \u201cNo, dude. Just different.\u201d He tapped Riggs\u2019 nose. \u201cOne of my special powers, capiche?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Phin. He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me, Ned. Romanian it is, although it makes little sense.\u201d I knew what he meant; Victorian was the only one alive. I guessed he was still alive, anyway.</p><p>Ned grinned. \u201cYeah, and I\u2019m a hundred and twelve years old. Talk about making sense, huh dude? There could be dozens of Romanian bloodsuckers in the States\u2014not just the Arcoses.\u201d</p><p>Phin chuckled. \u201cGuess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. There\u2019s more,\u201d Ned said, holding up a hand. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bloodsucking activity going on in Charleston. Been picking it up in doses, but the dose just grew. Now it\u2019s like ... a large blip on the sonar, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Phin nodded. \u201cThanks, Ned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob. Well, I gotta dip on out. I\u2019m headed to a big gamer convention in Portland tomorrow. Should be sweet,\u201d he said, and turned to look at me. \u201cYou take care, babe. Watch your back.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cI always do.\u201d</p><p>Ned smiled. \u201cRighteous.\u201d He nodded to Phin, then glanced at Riggs, Seth, and Zetty. \u201cLater, dudes.\u201d His gaze turned softer when he looked at Josie. \u201cLater, Josephine.\u201d</p><p>Collectively, they all said, \u201cLater\u201d; Ned saluted and left.</p><p>As I always felt after any amount of time spent with Ned Gillespie, I thought I\u2019d just left one of Bill and Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventures. Smart guy, though, and he knew his shit to the nth degree. And the Dupr\u00e9s trusted him indefinitely. And, I confess, he was cute in a goofy, nerdy sort of way.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Phin said, running a hand over his close-cut hair. He glanced down at the ziplocks filled with undead dead-dust on the floor. \u201cLet\u2019s get this stuff to Preacher. And Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I said, regarding Phin.</p><p>\u201cYou know what this means, right?\u201d A small smile tipped his mouth.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cHell yes, I know. It means you\u2019re staying here to babysit me until Eli gets back. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could stay at the house, if you want,\u201d he offered, meaning the Dupr\u00e9 mansion.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, thanks. I have a business to run and all my stuff\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Phin shrugged. \u201cSuit yourself. But if you change your mind ...\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d I looked at Phin. \u201cDid Eli kill Victorian? Luc didn\u2019t say.\u201d I felt like I\u2019d know, and even though Victorian hadn\u2019t contacted me further, I didn\u2019t feel he was gone. I briefly wondered why I cared.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phin said. \u201cVictorian got away. Details later, though.\u201d</p><p>Well, that answered that.</p><p>By the time we\u2019d gathered at Preacher\u2019s, it was nearly midnight. My head had begun a slow throb, nearly as slow as my heartbeat, and when we stepped inside Da Plat Eye, my noggin was splitting into halves. Estelle gave me four ibuprofen (yeah, go figure\u2014regular FDA-approved medicine) and a glass of water, and I downed them. Phin said it was kickback adrenaline from killing vamps. I believed it.</p><p>What I didn\u2019t believe was Nyx\u2019s reaction to me.</p><p>The moment I stepped into Preacher\u2019 and Estelle\u2019s small, tidy living room, Nyx leapt from the sofa and hurled herself at me, full speed. She wrapped me in the largest, tightest bear hug she\u2019d ever given, I was sure of it. I hugged her back, and she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cOh, Riley,\u201d she said against my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2014\u201d She pulled back and looked at me. \u201cOh my God, I had no idea. Luc\u201d\u2014she glanced at him, then set her gaze on mine\u2014\u201ctook me to his house. I ... met his parents.\u201d Large blue eyes stared at me and blinked. She dropped her voice to almost a whisper. \u201cYou know, I saw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hugged them, too,\u201d Luc said jokingly.</p><p>I stared at my best friend, at her pigtails poking through the sides of her white and black striped skully, at her dark red lipstick, her pale skin. She blinked. \u201cI know, Riley.\u201d She leaned close to me. \u201cPreacher told me. Creatures of the afterlight,\u201d she whispered. \u201cVampires.\u201d</p><p>I could do little more than stare at my friend.</p><p>\u201cGilles explained some things, and Preacher, he took care of the rest\u2014including yours and Seth\u2019s tendencies,\u201d Nyx continued. \u201cHe wanted to wait for you, but I ... I insisted. After I\u2019d met Luc\u2019s parents, I had to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It hit me then, and I grasped Nyx\u2019s forearms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I lied to you before about Seth,\u201d I said. \u201cIt ... was the only way. At least, I thought.\u201d I looked hard at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d understand, and I didn\u2019t want to drag you into all of this.\u201d</p><p>Luc was suddenly at Nyx\u2019s side. \u201cShe handled it all pretty good,\u201d he said, and I noticed a protective hand move to Nyx\u2019s back. \u201cEven when Papa changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fainted, but Luc stayed right beside me,\u201d Nyx confessed, then narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cNo more secrets, huh Riley?\u201d Seth walked over and put his arm around Nyx.</p> <p>I held my hand up. \u201cNo more, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Nyx glanced up at Seth. \u201cI always felt it was something more,\u201d she said, and I knew she meant Seth hadn\u2019t been on drugs. \u201cNever thought it was something like this, though.\u201d</p><p>Seth pulled Nyx against him and kissed the top of her head through the skully. \u201cLove ya, other sis.\u201d</p><p>Nyx\u2019s closed-eyed smile spoke way more than her words. \u201cLove you, too, little bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDere\u2019s more to be done, dat\u2019s right,\u201d said Preacher, rising from his recliner and glancing at all gathered. It was late, and the lamp in the corner cast a very dim amber glow over the room, the haint blue ceiling mixing and casting a unique, surreal metallic color against the newsprint on the walls (to keep the wudus busy). I knew he and Estelle had to be exhausted. \u201cYou, Nyxinnia, will stay wit Riley and Seth\u2014for a few nights, right? Until we know what\u2019s out dere, we want you safe. You don\u2019t have tendencies like she and her brodder do. Deys have powers now, and dem Dupr\u00e9s taught \u2019em to fight. You don\u2019t know dat stuff, and I don\u2019t want you gittin\u2019 hurt, girl. Luc will go wit you to your house and git your stuff, dat\u2019s right. Den you come back here.\u201d</p> <p>Nyx nodded without question. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter a few days, when we know what\u2019s out dere, we\u2019ll git your house right and den you can go back,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>Nyx again nodded.</p><p>\u201cS\u00e9raphin,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Phin responded.</p><p>\u201cYou and dose boys dere help me with dis stuff, right.\u201d He crossed the room and lifted an aged, handcarved wooden box from the mantel. I knew it well. It usually contained conjuring herbs, crushed bones, body parts of various creatures\u2014sort of a tackle box full of hoodoo stuff. He reached in and lifted three balls of burlap, larger than what he\u2019d given me earlier. It was more like the size of a baseball. \u201cI want you boys to shake dis around da building\u2019s foundation, inside each doorway, window, and da balcony.\u201d He handed the sachets to Phin.</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Phin said to the others. \u201cJosie, you stay with Riley until we finish.\u201d</p><p>Josie, seated on the floor in front of Estelle\u2019s feet, looked up at me. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Phin and the guys left.</p><p>Luc\u2019s cell rang then, and when he answered it, he looked directly at me. \u201cYeah, Bro, everything\u2019s cool,\u201d he said, then quietly slipped out into the foyer.</p><p>It was Eli. And somehow, as childish and immature as it sounded, it pissed me off that he\u2019d call Luc and not me. Inwardly, I fumed. I\u2019m talking frickin\u2019 frackin\u2019 fumed.</p><p>I immediately turned on my acute-hearing ability and eavesdropped.</p><p>\u201cYou should tell her, dude,\u201d Luc said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you telling me what to do, Jean-Luc,\u201d Eli replied, his French thick. \u201cAnd I damn-fuck sure don\u2019t need her knowing anything. If I wanted to talk to her about it, I would. I don\u2019t. End of story. It would just freak her out more. I was just checking in. Papa wouldn\u2019t answer his cell. I\u2019ll be home later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d Luc said. \u201cShe had visitors today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Eli\u2019s voice grew eerily controlled.</p><p>\u201cThree newlings. Somehow they got under Ned\u2019s radar. Riley and Nyx were alone; Riley killed two of them. Seth came in with us and took out the last one,\u201d Luc said. \u201cShe\u2019s okay. They\u2019re both okay. I took Nyx to Papa. She knows.\u201d</p><p>The line was deadly silent for several seconds, then a burst of French expletives filled the air\u2014so loud I almost covered my ears. \u201cWhat the fuck did I leave you there for, huh? She\u2019s not capable of taking care of herself. Tendencies or not\u2014goddamn, Luc\u2014she\u2019s still a fucking mortal. She could have been ripped apart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>I jumped at Phin\u2019s voice, and quickly turned my attention to him. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cShame on you.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cFinished. Let\u2019s go.\u201d It cracked me up, every once in a while, to catch the silver ball pierced through his tongue. He\u2019d kept it, even after the disturbances in Savannah. But now I had another distraction. What was it Eli didn\u2019t want me to know? I guessed I\u2019d find out soon enough. Poor Luc had really caught hell from his older brother. It was my fault totally. I shouldn\u2019t have turned my hearing so far down. Lesson learned.</p><p>I quickly hugged Preacher and Estelle, then wrapped my arms around Nyx\u2019s neck. \u201cEverything will be okay,\u201d I assured her, trying to assure myself as well. I pulled back and looked at her. \u201cI\u2019ll wait up for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cLuc\u2014he\u2019s really nice.\u201d</p><p>I knew it. They liked each other. \u201cYeah, he is,\u201d I agreed. \u201cHe\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be careful over dere, girl,\u201d said Estelle, who\u2019d been uncharacteristically quiet the whole time. \u201cI don\u2019t like all dis stuff goin\u2019 on and will feel better once dat Eli Dupr\u00e9 gets his carcass home and watches my baby good, dat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Me, too.\u201d I kissed my surrogate grandparents.</p><p>With all that said and done, we left.</p><p>Riggs and Zetty headed home; Luc took Nyx to get her stuff to stay at my place for a few nights; the rest of us stayed at my apartment. While Phin, Seth, and Josie flipped through the channels, got hooked, and fell into watching The Breakfast Club, I decided to take a long, hot shower. Too many thoughts and feelings ran through me at top speed; I was sure I\u2019d need a beer afterward. I craved a friggin\u2019 cigarette, but I\u2019d promised Seth I\u2019d lay off and stay off, so I excused myself, grabbed some comfy jammies, and headed to my bathroom. Having turned on the hot water, stripped, and climbed into the tiled stall, I let the steaming water soak through my hair and run over my body. My thoughts ran likewise.</p><p>I\u2019d agreed, at the insistence of Elise Dupr\u00e9s, to allow her to homeschool Seth. I\u2019d been hesitant at first; I wanted him to have as normal an upbringing as possible, and that meant a normal school, with normal interaction with other kids. Soccer. Baseball. Prom. Graduation. I\u2019d finally realized none of that was possible. Not only had our mother been murdered, but our father was a loser deadbeat criminal who had abandoned us and was then imprisoned. Seth had nearly succumbed to vampirism in the worst possible way. Homeschooling under Elise\u2019s supervision and instruction could only be a positive. She\u2019d schooled all of her children, and, I\u2019d eventually discovered, all but Josie had attended college. She\u2019d looked and been too young to attend, but had obtained degrees just the same. Before computers, she was homeschooled by Elise and was fluent in English, Latin, and Spanish, as well as her native French tongue. Eli had a law degree from the University of Glasgow in Scotland (the prick never even told me). Phin had a master\u2019s degree in biology from the University of Georgia, and Luc had earned his degree in astrology from Edinburgh. Astrology! Jean-Luc and S\u00e9raphin were frickin\u2019 scientists. Talk about kick-ass undead Myth Busters. All in all, I felt confident in Elise\u2019s teachings, and Seth was all for it. Of course, I think it may have had something to do with spending more time with Josie, but that was just my astute sisterly observation. Anyway, I was okay with the decision, and Elise would start classes with Seth tomorrow\u2014as long as no other vampires showed up to attack us. Gilles had pulled me to the side to say how absolutely thrilled his wife was to have another pupil to instruct. He\u2019d said his Elise had spent hours gathering teaching supplies and information from the Internet, so it was a fantastic dual-purpose decision, in my book.</p><p>The steaming water carried the scent of pomegranate as it mixed with the soap I\u2019d just picked up, and as I lathered my body, my thoughts returned to Eli, and what I\u2019d heard him say. I won\u2019t lie\u2014it\u2019d stung. Try as I might to be a tough-ass through and through, I was still a woman. I did have feelings and I could be hurt. I hated that Eli had that power over me. I\u2019d sworn nobody\u2014no man\u2014would ever have it over me again. Not after what that insane fuck did to my mother. I could still see her sopping wet hair clinging to her pale face. I could still feel her body in my arms, limp; her eyes wide and fixed, a pair of lifeless orbs that used to look upon me with such love but that could no longer look at all. Those last few years of her life I\u2019d been nothing but heartache to her; I regretted so much. Tears built behind my lids, and I allowed myself to cry. God, I missed my mom. Every day, I saw her face, and I wished like hell she hadn\u2019t died.</p><p>I plopped a glob of shampoo in my palm and scrubbed my head and my hair; then I rinsed and did the same with conditioner. Finally, and only when I felt the water start to run lukewarm, did I turn the knobs to Off and step out of the shower. I wrapped one towel around my hair, another around my body, and in the next second I collapsed, exhausted on my bed. My eyes grew heavy; for some reason, I fought sleep. Finally, I lost the battle.</p><p>I have no idea how long I lay there. I could hear Emilio Estevez\u2019s laughter spilling from the TV in the living room. It was the last thing I heard before falling into darkness.</p><p>When next my eyes fluttered open, I was walking through a park; live oaks, moss; a large pineapple fountain with water spraying sparkled beneath the tall black iron lamps posted along the walkway. It was dark and too late to be out alone. The air was damp, humid, heavy with brine. Palms mixed with live oaks. Leaning against the fountain was a woman: late twenties, maybe, average height, very curvy, with black hair pulled into a high ponytail, tight jeans, T-shirt, sneakers. She had a cell phone cradled between her chin and shoulder as she talked to ... someone. Angry. Upset. Crying. She did not know I was behind her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was not me.</p><p>I was him.</p><p>The monster.</p> <p>I could feel his anticipation within me as I stood directly behind her, watching her, smelling her. I tried to scream, to warn her to run. I drew in air; it died in my throat. I tried to reach with my hands, to shove her, make her realize she was in danger; they weren\u2019t my hands that appeared before me. They were male arms, male hands, not young, not gentle. Inside, I felt as though I\u2019d combust; no matter how hard I struggled, I was imprisoned in his body; my pleas, my screams were nothing more than ghosts. They didn\u2019t exist, and she\u2019d never hear them.</p><p>I now felt what the monster felt; adrenaline raged within me, a mixture of sexual headiness and dark, ravaging hunger. Every thump of her heart reverberated inside me; with every beat I imagined the hot rush of her blood pulsing into my throat. My excitement grew; my patience ran out. She turned. Her eyes widened.</p><p>Her scream died in my mouth.</p><p>With one hand I yanked her cell from her hand and threw it into the fountain; with the other I tore off her T-shirt, her bra, and tossed them aside, all while holding her still with my fangs locked into her bottom jaw. I, not the monster, even knowing she\u2019d never hear me, tried to scream, to warn, but nothing happened. His actions were now mine, as if I were the one controlling the actions. I sobbed hysterically, wanting to at least escape what I knew was about to happen; I could do neither. I could do nothing but accept, be his fucking puppet. With both hands free now, he palmed her breasts; heavy, soft, scraping his thumbs over her nipples. It made his cock throb. As I stared so close into her widened, horror-stricken, pain-filled eyes, I knew she was paralyzed. He\u2019d known exactly where to inject his fangs to keep her quiet; to keep her still. Yet mentally, she was all there. She knew what was happening. Just like I did. Both of us were victims. Both of us could do nothing to escape.</p><p>In the next instant, his fangs retracted from her jaw, her head fell to the side, and he plunged his teeth into her heart; ripped into her chest cavity, tearing at her flesh, seeking the organ he craved. He was like a ravaged wolf. He found it and sank his fangs deep into its center. She didn\u2019t scream; she didn\u2019t move. He\u2019d paralyzed her, but her heart still thumped erratically, and with every wild beat, her warm blood pumped just as fiercely into his mouth, his throat, like an ejaculation. It was a sexual rush as well as a frenzied, necessary feed. It got him off, and, as he drained her blood, he came, hard, fast. Nausea crashed over me.</p> <p>Then, it slowed; her life left her with each slow beat, until it was over. When he lifted his head, I looked down at her ripped, bloodied flesh, her bare breasts, her pale skin, and her wide, lifeless eyes. He lifted her as though she were nothing more than a rag doll and tossed her limp body into the fountain. Her head hit the pineapple statue with a hard crack, then slid into the water. Facedown, she saw no more. He wiped his mouth with the back of his arm and walked away.</p><p>As if a bolt had rushed my body, I shot up.</p><p>Phin knelt beside my bed, staring at me, his hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you wake me?\u201d I asked suddenly, angered, adrenaline still pumping. \u201cI could have followed him!\u201d I glanced down and was glad my towel was still intact.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you see this time?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat, Riley?\u201d</p><p>I told him. I told him everything. He watched me closely the whole time, not once taking his eyes off mine. \u201cJesus, Phin\u2014it\u2019s ... horrible. I can\u2019t even describe what it feels like to be there and be ... helpless. To feel his disgusting desires within me.\u201d Anger raged within me, and I looked at him hard. \u201cI want to kill that prick, Phin. I want to kill him myself. I want him out of me!\u201d</p> <p>Phin grazed my jaw with his knuckle. \u201cI know,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI can\u2019t promise we\u2019ll let you kill him alone, but we\u2019ll get him. We\u2019ll kill him, Riley. Collectively.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cSwear to God, we will.\u201d</p><p>My gaze was locked on his, so much like Eli\u2019s. For a split second, I wanted Eli so badly, it hurt. I missed him. \u201cPhin, the monster\u2019s out of control. I\u2019ve never felt such rage, hatred\u2014such sickness. It\u2019s like something out of a horror movie.\u201d I pinched the bridge of my nose, then peered at him again. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat was happening?\u201d</p><p>He tapped my temple. \u201cI could hear it. Hear it, but not see it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThanks. Luc and Nyx aren\u2019t back yet?\u201d</p><p>Phin rose. \u201cNo, but they\u2019re on their way. Why don\u2019t you get some sleep? Some real sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good idea,\u201d I said, and rose. \u201cThanks again. For staying with me. I hope I didn\u2019t do anything weird.\u201d</p><p>Phin smiled. \u201cNothing weirder than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p> <p>Phin laughed and left the room. I changed into a pair of loose boxers and a black cami. Then I brushed my teeth, pulled my damp hair into a ponytail, and crept back to bed.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>For a moment, I cranked my acute hearing to wide-open. Sounds came at me in a whispered rush, as if a faucet had been turned on high: people talking all over the city, phones ringing, laughter, dogs barking, horns blasting, music playing, people screwing, moaning, crying, fighting, TV\u2019s flipping ninety thousand channels at a time. Sweat gathered at my forehead and dripped down my temples. I squeezed my eyes tightly shut, grasped the bedsheets in my fists, and breathed\u2014in and out; in and out. Slowly, rhythmically, easily. I chose one sound, dug one single sound out of a million\u2014a priest, praying\u2014and honed in. It seemed the safest. It seemed the wisest. The priest\u2019s voice, deep, even, consoling, filled my ears, and all the other sounds of the city fell away. I had no idea what he said; he spoke mostly in Latin, and every once in a while he\u2019d say an English amen. It soothed me, so much that my body relaxed, the throbbing in my head eased, and my breathing returned to normal. I don\u2019t know why, but I felt safe. It struck me that I hadn\u2019t been to church in years.</p><p>I listened for Nyx and Luc to come back, listened to an occasional giggle from Josie, the familiar chuckle of my brother, and the low hum of CSI: Miami on the TV. My lids grew heavy, I grew tired, the noises became more distant, and before I knew it, I\u2019d drifted again.</p><p>I found myself wandering the corridors of an enormous castle, one of ancient stone, wooden rafters, antique tapestries. A gray cat sat perched upon a window seat, napping, its purrs thrumming within me. No one was about\u2014not at first. Soon, though, I heard laughter, and I followed the sound to a distant chamber, upstairs. A chill coursed through me, and when I glanced down at myself I saw why. I wore nothing more than a garnet silk robe, a pair of black spiked boots that laced in the back and rose to my thighs, my hair curled and piled loosely on my head. A garnet silk choker graced my throat. Why was I dressed like this? Where was I?</p><p>I continued on, but the more I sought the others, the farther away the voices seemed to get. Then, I was lost, deep in the bowels of the castle, where lights were dimmer, shadows stretched long, and the chill set into my bones. I pulled the edges of the robe closer together, but the robe was tight, barely fitting. Finally, I saw a light flickering beneath a closed door, and I pressed my cheek to the aged wood. There was warmth inside.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d a familiar voice called from inside. \u201cI\u2019ve something to show you.\u201d</p><p>As though I had no control of my actions, my palms flattened against the door and I pushed. It swung on creaky hinges, and, as I peered inside, I saw, standing beside a roaring fire, Victorian Arcos. He was dressed in head-to-toe black Armani, right down to his leather boots. His hair remained long, pulled loosely in a queue. My body tensed immediately with fear; I backed out and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t run,\u201d he said.</p><p>Victorian stood behind me, in the corridor. His breath brushed the shell of my ear. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>As if it were someone else, my body turned to face him. I had no control. With my back to the door, I stared up into his beauty, breathless, speechless. \u201cEli spared your life. Why? What did you two discuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Eligius had no choice but to spare my life. And I will leave it to him to explain why. Things are much more complicated than you or he can even imagine. Now, enough of this chatter. I cherish these times with you, and I don\u2019t want any other interference.\u201d He looked deeply into my eyes. \u201cI know you want me to touch you, Riley,\u201d he said, his exotic accent washing over me as he abruptly ended any further questions. They\u2019re on my tongue, but I\u2019m unable to speak. \u201cJust as badly as I want you to touch me.\u201d He lifted a knuckle and grazed first my jaw, then dragged it down the column of my throat, catching the material of my robe and pushing it off my shoulder. \u201cYour body art fascinates me,\u201d he said. As he leaned close to inspect my inked skin, his breath brushed, whispered, enticed. \u201cJust as you fascinate me,\u201d he continued, his brown eyes locked on mine as his hand, skimming my shoulder, lowered to the sash tying the silky material together. He pulled the sash slowly, until the loose knot fell free and the robe gaped open, revealing a clear path of skin between my breasts, all the way to the small triangle of silk that was my panties. Victorian\u2019s eyes grew darker.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t continue to torment me like this, in my subconscious,\u201d I said, my gaze holding his. \u201cYou may be able to control me, but it\u2019s not really me you\u2019re getting your way with, is it? It\u2019s not really me you\u2019re touching, or me you\u2019re getting off on. I\u2019m being forced, with no say-so, no control. You might as well have a fucking blow-up doll, Victorian.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, his eyes rolled back, the look of pure satisfaction on his face. He then looked at me. \u201cJust the way you say my name\u2014the way Victorian falls from your tongue and past your lips makes me hard,\u201d he whispered against my ear, pressing his body closer to mine. \u201cFeel for yourself, Riley.\u201d With the back of his knuckles, he trailed the exposed skin of my abdomen, letting it linger against the silk of my panties. I wanted him so badly to stop; I thought I\u2019d come if he moved a fraction lower. I hated him for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you insist on pulling reactions from me?\u201d I asked furiously, and moved my hand to knock his. It was then I felt exactly what he\u2019d been talking about. The hardness wasn\u2019t him; it was the silver blade strapped to my thigh.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he said, his eyes growing warm. \u201cI make you do nothing. You\u2019ve had the power to kill me all along.\u201d His voice was a whisper against my skin. \u201cYou have the power now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I kill a dream figment?\u201d I asked, my fingers brushing the blade.</p> <p>\u201cI am not a figment,\u201d he returned, brushing his lips across my cheek. \u201cI interject myself here; you keep me here. Everything we share is real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me keep you here, just like you make me feel,\u201d I said. \u201cJust like you keep me from prodding you further about what you told Eli. Mind control\u2019s a bitch when put to you like that, right? Sort of takes the romance out of things. So, to change the subject, what do you know of the ones who attacked me? What did you tell Eli?\u201d</p><p>Victorian\u2019s body stilled; he grasped my chin and lifted my face. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018attacked\u2019 you?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, surprised at his animosity for whoever attempted to hurt me. It seemed ... genuine. I guess it had happened after Eli had left him. \u201cThree vampires, two of them newlings, made it inside my apartment and attacked my friend and me. I took two of them out. Luckily, my brother came in and took out the last one. That one nearly got me.\u201d I tilted my head in question. \u201cYou know nothing about it?\u201d</p><p>Anger, and maybe even a little hurt, flashed over Victorian\u2019s features. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t know anything about it. Why would I want to hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>I stared at him. \u201cOne of our friends with tendencies has the ability to sense vampires miles and miles away\u2014yet he didn\u2019t sense these until they were literally at my apartment. He thinks it had something to do with Romanian magic.\u201d</p><p>Victorian stared down at me, hurt. \u201cI am not the only Romanian vampire in existence, Riley,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d never hurt you. I wish you\u2019d believe me.\u201d</p><p>I stared, not knowing what to say.</p><p>He leaned down then and brushed his lips over mine. \u201cTo convince you, I\u2019ll release you from this dream, instead of your Eligius rescuing you from it, like always.\u201d His mouth lingered against mine, before whispering, \u201cI shall see you soon. ...</p><p>With a start, I sat up.</p><p>Lamplight filtered in through my balcony window, and the TV\u2019s low hum met my ears. I glanced at the clock.</p> <p>No more than five minutes had passed since the last time I\u2019d checked.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, I lay back down and stared up at the ceiling. Confusion webbed my brain. I knew I didn\u2019t want Victorian. Yet despite what the Dupr\u00e9s thought, I felt he wasn\u2019t evil\u2014not like his brother.</p><p>As I closed my eyes for the third and hopefully final time, I saw the hurt etched in Victorian\u2019s face behind my lids.</p><p>I knew then I\u2019d made my mind up about him.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t the same opinion the Dupr\u00e9s had. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about that yet.</p><p>Three more thoughts crossed my mind before slumber claimed me\u2014even if for only a few hours. One, the murder I\u2019d witnessed had taken place in Charleston. I\u2019d visited Savannah\u2019s sister city only a few times, mostly for art conventions, and I hadn\u2019t strolled the gardens while there. But I did remember the pineapple fountain. It was a city landmark. It was also that girl\u2019s grave. We\u2019d be going there soon, I was sure of it.</p><p>Two, I was feeling drained. I don\u2019t mean I\u2019m-having-my-period-with-no-energy drained. It was more like an every-time-I-witness-a-murder-it-saps-life-out-of-me drained. It made me feel ... weird. Angry. Edgy. It was taking me longer to recover after each vision, and I wasn\u2019t sure what to do about it.</p><p>Three, a fight was coming\u2014another war, and this one was way different than the one in Bonaventure. There\u2019d be more vampires. There\u2019d be more bloodshed.</p> <p>Don\u2019t ask me how I knew; I just did. And I really hated that.</p><p>Part Six</p><p>POSSESSIVE</p><p>\u201cTerror made me cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Emily Bront\u00eb</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not going to get this\u2014I don\u2019t get it myself. But I\u2019m brutally honest to a fault, so why hide a confession? I\u2019m attracted to Victorian. Now, don\u2019t get your panties all wadded up. I don\u2019t mean boom-chick-a-wow-wow attracted. He\u2019s beautiful and sexy as damn friggin\u2019 hell\u2014I\u2019ll give him that. But no\u2014that\u2019s not how I mean. I mean ... shit. I don\u2019t know what I mean. It\u2019s hard to explain. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, please\u2014Eli is my heart, my soul, even though I can\u2019t admit it out loud yet, and the more he\u2019s away from me, the more pissy I become, which equals, in my book anyway, the more I care about him. Despite the sexual dreams I always seem to be involved in with Victorian, that\u2019s not how I feel about him. A kindred spirit\u2014that\u2019s it! I feel sort of a kindred spirit with him. Does that make sense? Probably not. It doesn\u2019t, even to me. And I\u2019m pretty sure Victorian would hate it. He\u2019s made no qualms about his intentions with me; he wants in my pants. Probably more, but it ain\u2019t happening. All I know is that, while it irritates me to the point of wanting to hit someone that Victorian intrudes his kinky self into my dreams, I don\u2019t want him dead anymore. I just don\u2019t feel that he\u2019s evil. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m positive he\u2019d help me, if times called for his help. And I\u2019m pretty sure all that sets Eli\u2019s ass on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>\u201cA woman\u2019s mutilated body was found in the city\u2019s pineapple fountain early this morning by city workers. An autopsy is being performed. Next, a new cannon for the battery? No, says Charleston\u2019s historical society. More details at six.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and glanced at Phin, who sat perched on the kitchen counter, watching me eat a bowl of Cap\u2019n Crunch. Sunlight streamed in from the window, making his short buzzed hair glow golden at the tips. \u201cI hate being right,\u201d I said. \u201cI knew I recognized that fountain.\u201d I was on edge, pissed, and uncertain ... about everything. \u201cDoes Eli know what\u2019s going on here? Victorian is not the threat\u2014it\u2019s him. That monster. Whoever he is.\u201d</p><p>Phin\u2019s gaze softened. \u201cYeah, he knows, and he trusts us to keep you safe until he returns\u2014which should be very soon. And he thinks otherwise, Riley. He believes Victorian is a full threat. I\u2019m not positive why you feel otherwise, but please, don\u2019t be fooled.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if I wanted to jump up and leave Savannah. I had a business to run, and I\u2019d more than once dumped my share of work onto Nyx\u2019s shoulders. No offense to Nyx, and pardon my arrogance, but people sought me out. The ones who made an appointment with me wanted art by me in particular. Not all, but some. Okay, most. It\u2019d be like having gone to OCC to have a custom chopper made and you didn\u2019t get Pauly Sr. or Pauly Jr., or even Mikey. You got a fine craftsman, but not the one you wanted. It was my job, my career, and I enjoyed giving people one-of-a-kind body art. I hated ditching my customers again. Yet one thing I knew for damn sure was that I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of innocents dying at the hand of that motherfucker. I couldn\u2019t bear watching it\u2014damn, almost participating in it. Something had to freaking give.</p><p>\u201cIt will give,\u201d Phin said, his gaze direct, assured. \u201cAnd we have a contact in Charleston. A small group of guardians, if you will. They\u2019re not ready for us yet. When they are, we\u2019ll go. Until then, I watch your ass, you carry on your business, Seth gets tutored by Mama. Period.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my gaze. \u201cYou could have just asked me. You don\u2019t have to go fishing inside my noggin, ya know.\u201d</p><p>He wagged his blond brows. \u201cWhat fun would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA group of guardians?\u201d I asked, curious. \u201cThis sitaround-and-wait crap is sounding a lot like what happened here. Why can\u2019t we just pack silver, rush Charleston, hook up with the gang, and kick ass?\u201d</p><p>Phin sighed, frustration etched in his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s never that easy. First, we don\u2019t step on each other\u2019s toes. They\u2019re a prideful street gang, and some of the members have been guardians of Charleston for centuries. Very rough around the edges and prefer to handle their own problems. Still governed by Preacher\u2019s family, though. They watch over the city. Like Savannah, they haven\u2019t had trouble in a long, long time. And I\u2019m not frustrated.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my gaze. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing such a hot job lately,\u201d I said. I knew Preacher had kin in Charleston, and some in Buford and Edisto. I did not know he had a rough gang of vampiric guardians acting in the same manner as the Dupr\u00e9s.</p><p>\u201cAll had been calm until the Arcoses were released,\u201d Phin said, rubbing his hand over his hair. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the trouble\u2019s being caused by newlings created by the brothers. And the ones they\u2019ve created. It\u2019s a snowball now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d I said, although I didn\u2019t agree with him on one brother. \u201cWell, if they don\u2019t get a grip soon, we\u2019ll have to go whether they call us or not.\u201d I stared hard at him. \u201cI don\u2019t like what I\u2019m seeing, Phin. I don\u2019t. And for the sake of sounding selfish, I\u2019d really rather not be the eyeballs of a vicious killer. Know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Phin slipped off the counter and placed a hand on my shoulder. \u201cI know, Ri. Hang in there. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>After dumping a few cups of Gullah tea in my system, I pulled on a pair of faded jeans, an Inksomnia T-shirt, and Vans, and I ran Chaz to the vet. The sweet dog was acting normal, but moving a little more slowly than usual. The vet checked him out and assured me he was okay, probably just a little sore, and to let Chaz monitor his own activity. I felt sure the main thought that ran through Chaz\u2019s head as he whizzed through the air was What the hell? Since it was an old building, the drop hadn\u2019t been as drastic as it could\u2019ve been, but it made me sick to think of that bloodsucker throwing Chaz off the balcony. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I got back home, Nyx was in the kitchen making scrambled eggs and toast. She was dressed for work, wearing a black 1940\u2019s-themed pencil dress with a sweetheart neckline, stockings with the seam up the back of the leg, and peep-toe pumps. Her hair was pulled into a pair of curled pigtails, and she wore bright red lipstick and a black choker with a silver spiderweb dangling from the throat. She reminded me of an adorably Goth version of I Love Lucy. Luc, of course, was perched on the counter beside her. Phin was on the sofa watching MythBusters, and Josie and Seth were already at the Dupr\u00e9 House for Seth\u2019s first day of school. All in all, I guessed this was as relatively normal as it was going to get for us.</p><p>Eli was still gone. It still hurt.</p><p>It pissed me off even more.</p> <p>I felt as if I were having an out-of-body experience the whole day; I was there, but it wasn\u2019t really me. It was more as if I were looking down and watching myself. Nothing felt real. Everything felt surreal, as if I were trapped in a dream, in an old black-and-white movie.</p><p>That was the story of my life lately.</p><p>Even with Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u201cValleys of Neptune\u201d thumping in the shop, I couldn\u2019t be pulled into that zone I loved. I managed good work, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it like usual, and that pissed me off.</p><p>The early part of the day rolled by; I\u2019d inked that flower dragon on the lower back of a skinny biology major. Without the cushion of a little fat, she said it felt as if I was inking her backbone, and honestly I thought she was going to pass out. I hadn\u2019t had a passer-outer in quite some time . I had to stop, give her some water, let her catch her breath. I was impressed, though; she was a trouper and wanted to continue. We finally finished the outline, and I made her appointment for six weeks to come by for the fill-in. By the time she left Inksomnia, her color had returned. All I could think was that I probably was not going to be here.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, then jumped as Gene, the stuffed black raven, cawed at her exit.</p> <p>\u201cLater,\u201d I said, then decided to grab some lunch. Luc offered to go get it, but I needed some air, needed to be alone, and needed to just ... release my thoughts, I guess, or maybe my bad mood. It was four p.m. and daylight; there was no fear of vampires lurking in the shadows, so the Dupr\u00e9s didn\u2019t push. My next appointment wasn\u2019t until five fifteen, so I grabbed my backpack and left.</p><p>Stifling, humid air hit me the moment I stepped out of Inksomnia, and I drew in a deep breath of the everpresent brine rolling off the Savannah River directly across the cobbles from my shop. I turned left. The tourists had thinned but hadn\u2019t completely disappeared, and I dodged bodies of all types and ages, wearing everything from plaid Bermuda shorts and T-shirts to long pull-over beach dresses and flip-flops; smiling, unwary people pointing in windows, snapping photos of the river walk and riverboats, and walking out of shops with bags of goodies from historic Savannah.</p><p>All I could think about was that dark-haired girl, her ripped-open chest, and her head cracking against the pineapple fountain in Charleston.</p><p>I stopped in at Kevin Barry\u2019s Irish Pub, ordered a corned beef Reuben on pumpernickel with double fries and malt vinegar, a large sweet tea, and headed out to the river walk to park on a bench and chow down. The September sun beat against my skin. I pulled a long swig of tea from the white Styrofoam cup, unwrapped the sandwich, and bit into the warm, crunchy, toasted dark bread. Corned beef and sauerkraut gushed out the sides. I closed my eyes and chewed. Yes, it was delicious. Yes, I ate every crumb. Yes, I know I\u2019m a hog.</p><p>No, it did not relieve my mind of the problems at hand.</p><p>I wanted a smoke. A friggin\u2019 cigarette. Seth would kill me if I did, but man, the stress was piling up and a long drag on a cig would be heaven. But I\u2019d promised, so I didn\u2019t cave. And, I admit, I did feel better without them. I\u2019m surprised I hadn\u2019t gained any weight, but maybe my extensive Tendie workouts were enough to keep off the extra calories.</p> <p>I smelled him long before I heard his voice.</p><p>A shiver coursed through my body.</p><p>Eli slid onto the bench beside me. He said nothing, but I felt his eyes boring into me. Slowly, I turned my gaze to his. Behind a pair of shades he stared at me; a black T-shirt clung to his chest, and a pair of low-slung jeans hugged his hips. My eyes were glued to his lips; perfectly shaped, full, and memories of how those lips caressed my body, devoured my mouth, filled my head. Again, I shivered.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to keep your last appointment?\u201d he said silkily.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. Instead, I slowly poked a French fry into my mouth and chewed; another followed. After I\u2019d drained every drop of tea and eaten every single French fry, in total silence and extreme scrutiny, I inhaled deeply.</p><p>Eli reached over, grabbed my cup and wrappers, tossed them into the trash can beside the bench, then pulled me into a crushing hug. With strong arms, he embraced me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been less than forty-eight hours, but I missed the hell out of you,\u201d he said, his mouth against my temple. My arms went around him, and he pulled me closer.</p><p>\u201cForty-eight hours? I hadn\u2019t even noticed you were gone,\u201d I said against his throat, my voice muffled.</p> <p>I felt his chest rumble as he laughed. He pulled back, took off his shades, and stared down at me. The shocking blue intensity caused another shiver within me. \u201cWe\u2019ve things to discuss.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAfter my appointment. I can\u2019t get into the habit of ducking out on my clients, Eli.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy-lidded gaze, he regarded me. \u201cIs it a big tat, or a little one?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cMedium. Shouldn\u2019t take longer than an hour.\u201d</p><p>In silence, he lowered his head to kiss me, but I covered my mouth. \u201cStop! Reuben with slaw. Gross.\u201d</p><p>Eli merely smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey, Riley. Eli, right? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>I turned and shaded my eyes. Mullet Morrison stood, grinning, his hands stuffed into his jeans pockets. I smiled. \u201cHey, Mullet-Man. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Eli stuck his hand out and the two shook. \u201cMullet.\u201d</p><p>Mullet shrugged, glanced over his shoulder, and looked back at me. \u201cJust hangin\u2019 out until Tiff finishes shoppin\u2019 in the SoHo. She\u2019s in there picking out a dress or something. So how\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cInteresting as always. You?\u201d Eli sat silent beside me, his arm possessively around my shoulders.</p><p>Mullet nodded. \u201cSweet, sweet. Hey\u2014Tiff wants some ink. I told her we\u2019d come by next week maybe. Is that cool?\u201d</p><p>Before vampires, I could have said yes with assuredness. Now? I had no freaking idea what I\u2019d be doing next week. Hopefully, all the chaos in Charleston would be over. \u201cYeah, sure. Just have her call the shop and I\u2019ll work her in. Does she know what she wants?\u201d</p><p>Mullet scratched his jaw. \u201cYeah, I think she wants a Japanese koi fish along here.\u201d He stretched and pointed to his side. \u201cPretty sick, huh?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cSounds cool. Tell her to give me a call.\u201d</p><p>He stuck his fist out and bumped mine. \u201cSweet. Later, Riley. Eli. Oh, hey\u2014did you hear about the murders in Charleston?\u201d</p><p>My insides froze at the mention of them. \u201cHeard something about a body being found at the pineapple fountain. Why?\u201d</p><p>Mullet peered at me. \u201cYou know, my cousin\u2019s on the police force, and he says there\u2019s been like, nine murders there over the past few weeks. Some pretty sick shit, from what Kelly says. Freaky, huh? They think it might be a serial killer or some crazy psychopath. I hope to hell they don\u2019t come south.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight\u2014later then,\u201d he said, and turned to leave. \u201cLock your doors, Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I answered, and watched him saunter off. \u201cCool guy, Mullet. I hope he never has to know the things I know\u2014especially that it doesn\u2019t matter how many cops are on the Charleston case, they won\u2019t catch the killer; rather, killers.\u201d I looked at Eli. \u201cThere has to be more than one vampire working the streets. Nine murders, Eli.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s expression was tight. \u201cAnd those are only the ones they\u2019ve discovered.\u201d</p><p>Pulling the cell out of my pack, I glanced at the time. I still had thirty minutes until my next appointment.</p><p>\u201cI have to speak with Papa,\u201d Eli said, rising. I followed. \u201cWe\u2019ve apparently got visitors. I\u2019ll meet you back here in a couple of hours to pick you up, oui?\u201d</p><p>I loved it when Eli occasionally threw in an unexpected French word. It was sexy as hell.</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s cool,\u201d I said. And before I could stop him, he grasped my jaw with one hand and pulled my mouth to his. He kissed me, Reuben, slaw, fries, and all, and it left me breathless and wanting to peel his clothes off right there on the riverfront to have my way with him.</p><p>He kissed my ear and whispered, \u201cLater. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I watched him slide his shades back onto his face and saunter away. He disappeared between two buildings. Shading my eyes with my hand, I glanced in the direction of Inksomnia, gauged the distance of walk time, and took off at a brisk pace. It still amazed me how fast a speed I could manage in a pair of spiked heels.</p><p>Eli was home! God Almighty, I\u2019d missed him. Yeah, in less than forty-eight hours, I\u2019d missed him. I was anxious to hear what he\u2019d found out, and anxious for other things, too. I crossed the cobbles to the storefront side, cut up and through the steep stairway alley between two stores, and emerged onto Factors Walk. Crossing the parking lane, I managed my way through relatively few tourists to Bay Street, and turned right. I\u2019d just passed the Cotton Exchange building when the smell hit me. It was so strong, pungent, that I stopped and looked around. There was nothing but tourists, cars, parking meters, and locals walking the sidewalk\u2014nothing out of the ordinary. A young guy wearing a dark gray suit and carrying a briefcase bumped into me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, then stared at my arms, then my breasts. He smiled and turned back up the walk.</p><p>I felt unsettled. I didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, I caught the scent again, and, concentrating, closing out all other scents of the city, I zeroed in on this one in particular. It was sharp, almost spicy-hot, reminding me of wasabi sauce, and something else undefined. It was a scent unlike anything I\u2019d ever inhaled, and I\u2019d inhaled a lot of stuff in my youth. I could almost taste it in my mouth. I turned and followed it, slightly amused by my weird, wolfish tendency. I crossed Bay Street onto Drayton and continued up the sidewalk. I weaved in and out of passersby, the scent drawing me into, of course, an empty alley. I stood there, staring at the aged brick walls, the ferns growing between the mortar, the rusty drainpipes running from the rooftop to the lane. I opened my hearing, just a fraction, and listened closely to the abundance of sounds around me, trying to pick through to see if anything felt stranger than usual. It wasn\u2019t easy. So many sounds\u2014voices, a toilet flushing, car stereos, a rapid-fire heartbeat that was so fast it could be nothing else but a mouse. I moved toward the single door in the alley, the scent growing stronger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I never made it.</p><p>My body was slammed, face-first, into the brick wall, my arms grabbed and jacked halfway up my back. Unknown hands\u2014they felt male\u2014patted me down the length of my legs and back up, between my thighs. In the next second, one of those hands slipped inside my low waistband, retrieving the blade I had stashed there against my hip. I jerked, struggled; I was again slammed.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d I growled, wondering why in hell my strength didn\u2019t seem very strong at all. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I said, finding it difficult to speak since my face was shoved against brick.</p> <p>\u201cThat all the silver you\u2019re packin\u2019?\u201d the voice said behind me, close to my ear. \u201cOr you got it hidden in places I can\u2019t find without a little diggin\u2019?\u201d He laughed. \u201cNot that I\u2019d mind, babe. Your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s all I got,\u201d I ground out. I gathered my strength; I felt it growing inside me from my toes upward. I elbowed my attacker, spun around, kneed his groin, and as he staggered back I swept his ankles. He hit the pavement with a thud. I pressed the heel of my boot at his throat.</p><p>He grinned. Sexy. Smug. \u201cNot bad. Luc told me you were good.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. He gently lifted a hand and moved my heel from his throat, then leapt up. He regarded me closely, as I did him.</p><p>Standing at approximately my height, my attacker wore skinny ripped jeans, chunky boots, a black ripped T-shirt, and had a headful of light brown and sunbleached dreads, pulled back at the nape of his neck. He wasn\u2019t overly muscular, but he was lean and strong as shit. Porcelain skin\u2014all except for a silver scar that shot out of one eyebrow\u2014full lips, and the strangest mercury-colored eyes I\u2019d ever seen. I stiffened. Realization kicked me in the gut.</p> <p>Vampire.</p><p>A slow smile, revealing perfect, blindingly white teeth, stretched across his perfect face. \u201cAh, got a brain to go with the beauty, I see,\u201d he drawled, and it was then I noticed the defined Charleston drawl. \u201cSweet. Eli\u2019s one lucky fuck.\u201d Well, minus the gang slang.</p><p>I frowned. This guy\u2014vamp\u2014knew Eli. \u201cWho are you and what the hell do you want?\u201d I said, and rubbed my forehead. Luckily, there was no blood. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that smell?\u201d I glanced at his hand wrapped around my blade. \u201cGive me my silver back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019d be a no, babe,\u201d he said, then inclined his head toward Drayton. \u201cNo matter how fine you are, or how much Dupr\u00e9 swears how trustworthy you are, I\u2019ll make that judgment call myself.\u201d He nodded again and pulled on a pair of dark shades. \u201cCome on. We walk. I\u2019ll talk.\u201d He peered at me over the tops of his glasses. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt ya, did I? Eli said you were tough. He\u2019d kick my ass if he thought I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>The image of me, kneeing Eli in the nuts for putting me through a test, made me almost smile. \u201cName.\u201d</p><p>The dreadlocked vampire laughed. \u201cYeah. Right.\u201d He stuck out his hand. \u201cNoah Miles.\u201d</p> <p>I was totally confused, but I grabbed his hand and squeezed hard. \u201cWell, Noah Miles, what the hell is this all about?\u201d</p><p>Noah rubbed his chin, laughed, and shook his head. We left the alley and started up Drayton. \u201cI called Eli a few hours ago. Shit\u2019s hittin\u2019 the fan in Charles Town, and he said you and the Dupr\u00e9s, and some others, are headed that way to help out.\u201d He glanced at me over the tops of his shades again, those silver eyes boring into mine. \u201cHe wanted me to check you out, make sure you were up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t do such a good job with my face smashed into the bricks and mortar,\u201d I said. This was the company Eli was referring to, apparently.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou did fine. And yeah, we\u2019re the company. Me and a few of my guys.\u201d</p><p>I walked without looking at him. \u201cYou had my blade in seconds.\u201d</p><p>Noah leaned close and bumped my shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m good, sweetheart. Besides, you had only one blade stashed on you. You probably would have stuck me, had you had another one. Besides, you had me on the ground and at your mercy in seconds. Pretty impressive.\u201d He regarded my arms, then my cheek. \u201cSweet tats, by the way. I\u2019ve heard about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? You\u2019ve heard of my artistic talents as well as my ass-kicking talents? That\u2019s great.\u201d I glowered at him. Although I hated to admit it\u2014I liked him. \u201cSo, Noah. How long have you been dead?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me as we walked, and a somber expression crossed his features for a split second. \u201cA long time, babe. Since the war.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich war?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cEngland vs. America, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I considered that. It was a long damn time to walk the earth. We walked up behind a small crowd waiting to cross Bay Street, and I looked at my new companion. \u201cSo, Eli sent you all the way to Savannah just for you to shove my face into a brick wall, feel me up, shove your hand down my pants, and pinch my blade? That\u2019s it? I passed the test?\u201d The fact that Eli knew all that while kissing me senseless irritated me.</p><p>In front of us, an elderly woman wearing a floppy straw hat turned around and regarded us over the tops of her very large white plastic sunglasses. I smiled. She glanced at my arms, her silver brows shot up, and she turned back around.</p><p>Noah grinned at me. \u201cNope. That was my own test. And yeah\u2014you passed,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter talking with Eli this morning, I was told I had to bring a small group of my guys with me, ask permission from Preacher, as well as Monsieur Dupr\u00e9, then set a game plan.\u201d We started to move with the crowd. \u201cYou must be pretty freaking important, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. How could I? I didn\u2019t understand any of it myself. We stepped onto the sidewalk on the other side of Bay, hit Factors Walk, and walked the cobbles down to the riverfront. I stopped. Noah stopped and regarded me. \u201cYou already know I have potent blood?\u201d I asked. I didn\u2019t want to look like the cartoon pork chop running around on legs any more than I had to.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah. We all do.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAlways have. We\u2019re governed by the Gullah-Gullah, too, don\u2019t forget. Pact and all, just like Savannah.\u201d He leaned over and sniffed me. \u201cBarely noticeable at all anymore, babe. No worries. Although there is something else funky in there.\u201d He sniffed again, and I swatted him away.</p><p>\u201cTwo strigoi,\u201d I offered. \u201cSo don\u2019t piss me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay-yamn,\u201d he said, dragging the word out with his drawl, admiration noticeably in his voice. \u201cMust have some wicked-ass tendencies.\u201d His grin was wide and bright white. \u201cThis I gotta see, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d I offered. \u201cMy name\u2019s Riley.\u201d</p><p>Noah barked out a laugh. \u201cSorry \u2019bout that\u2014habit.\u201d He lowered his shades and openly oogled me. \u201cBut I gotta tell you. You are a babe, babe.\u201d</p><p>At the riverfront, I stopped and rounded on Noah. \u201cSo there\u2019s some big meeting at the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 tonight? Permission slips and all that to be signed? That\u2019s all fine with me, but first I have clients to finish and a business to settle.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNyx is gonna kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet. I\u2019ll hang with you till tonight, then,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>I stared at him as we headed up the sidewalk toward Inksomnia. \u201cBehave yourself until Eli gets here.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I was raised a Southern gentleman, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and led him up the walk. Just before we reached the shop, I stopped and met Noah\u2019s shaded gaze. \u201cOkay, first, what was that smell? Second, why this, all of a sudden? Phin just told me you guys would contact us when you needed help. He even said your group and ours don\u2019t exactly get along.\u201d</p><p>Sincerity sank deep into Noah\u2019s features, surprising me. \u201cFirst\u201d\u2014he withdrew a sachet of something and dropped it into my hand\u2014\u201cmy mask. Most vampires, creatures of the afterlight, whatever, have a certain special something about them that makes them distinct from all others.\u201d He grinned. \u201cMine is my scent. If I didn\u2019t carry this around, I\u2019d have chicks\u2014of all species\u2014chasing me down. It was pretty enticing for the first twenty or so years, but then\u201d\u2014he shrugged\u2014\u201cwore my ass slap out, keeping up with all the women.\u201d He winked. \u201cNot to mention all the poodles named Fee Fee I had to chase off. Second\u201d\u2014his face grew serious\u2014\u201cone of ours was destroyed last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cSimply, we were outnumbered.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNever seen so many newlings gathered before. Freakin\u2019 out of control. We knew then we needed help.\u201d</p><p>I stuck out my hand and took his in a sincere shake. \u201cI\u2019m not a kick-ass vampire, but I promise to kick some vampire ass.\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cI totally believe you.\u201d</p><p>We started up the walk again, and, at Inksomnia\u2019s storefront window, I stopped once more. I still had his sachet in my hand. \u201cOkay, so wait a minute. Are you telling me that if you didn\u2019t have your magic anti-want-me powder, I would be all over you?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s smile was pure raw male seduction, and, for a quick second, my insides pinged with lust. He reached slowly down and pried the sachet out of my fingers, his face, those eyes, mere inches from mine. I shuddered. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m tellin\u2019 ya, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d I muttered, amazed, still feeling as if I were in a slight horny haze. I shook my head again, and he grinned. \u201cI hope my dog doesn\u2019t start humpin\u2019 your leg, Noah.\u201d I hoped I didn\u2019t start humpin\u2019 Noah\u2019s leg. God-damn.</p><p>Noah burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cMiles, sup my man?\u201d Luc\u2019s voice said, suddenly beside us, grabbing Noah\u2019s hand and the two bumping shoulders in a man-hug. Luc glanced at me, his brow raised in puzzlement. \u201cRi, you okay? Ah, dude\u2014you didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Noah said, smirking. \u201cShe asked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head, my gaze still transfixed on Noah. His smile was subtle but still seductive. Shithead. I shook my head again and moved between Luc and Noah, grabbed the black iron door handle of my shop, and opened it. \u201cYeah,\u201d I muttered to Luc, my head still a web of lust and confusion. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Before the door closed behind me, I heard both vampires laugh.</p><p>By the time I wrapped up my last client\u2014a sick freehand tribal tat of a raven inked onto the chest of a visiting RAF pilot from North umberland, England\u2014it was six thirty p.m. Noah had hung out in Inksomnia, watching me work, watching Nyx work, and catching up with Luc and Phin. Seth and Josie had wandered in around six, and had left right back out to the downtown branch library to check out books. Then, Eli arrived. We\u2019d all planned to meet up at the Dupr\u00e9 House by nine thirty. Permission slips. Game plan. Proving one\u2019s abilities. Stuff like that. Luc had taken Nyx home. After treating her house adequately with Preacher\u2019s special sauce, he\u2019d felt she was safe to return. She now knew all she had to do to have Luc there in an instant was to think it. She was cool with that\u2014probably cooler than cool. The two had been staring googly-eyed at each other all day long.</p> <p>The moment Eli walked in, he headed straight for Noah. They did that guy thing, slapping hands and then doing a man-hug. \u201cI heard my woman kicked your ass to the ground,\u201d Eli said with pride. \u201cGuess I shoulda warned you.\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned over Eli\u2019s shoulder at me. \u201cShe\u2019s a wildcat, man. She can definitely hold her own.\u201d</p><p>That, as I smiled at Noah, I sincerely appreciated.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Luc said. \u201cPapa\u2019s waiting for us.\u201d He glanced at Noah. \u201cYou ride with me.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s gaze found mine. \u201cYou ride with me.\u201d</p> <p>I met his gaze. \u201cNo. You ride with me.\u201d</p><p>The guys all laughed, and they left us alone. I locked the shop behind them, and before I could turn around, Eli was there. His arms encircled my waist; his mouth nuzzled against my neck. \u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I said, my eyes closing from the intoxicating feel of Eli\u2019s closeness.</p><p>He turned me in his arms and looked down at me. \u201cI want to tell you something. Alone. Not in front of my family.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tracked Victorian to Richmond. I could\u2019ve killed him.\u201d His eyes bore into mine. \u201cI wanted to kill him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause his mother begged me not to.\u201d</p><p>My eyes stretched wider. \u201cHis mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In my head. She swore Victorian was innocent\u2014has always been innocent.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the reason why.\u201d</p><p>I continued to stare, waiting for the answer.</p><p>Eli inhaled. \u201cShe also told me that by killing Victorian, you in turn would be harmed, in some form. Because you have his blood. His DNA. You are part of him.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cI have Valerian\u2019s DNA, too. You killed him, and I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that may be why you\u2019re experiencing kills,\u201d Eli said. \u201cVictorian wasn\u2019t quite the asshole I expected him to be. He was a lot more humble. But he did tell me something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe says Valerian isn\u2019t dead. That we may have destroyed his physical body, but he\u2019s found another way to revive.\u201d Eli caressed my jaw with his thumb. \u201cAnd I believe him.\u201d</p><p>The air in my lungs ceased. \u201cNo freaking way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to investigate it further, but I\u2019m pretty sure Valerian, in whatever form, is the cause of the disruption in Charleston. I believe Victorian.\u201d He scrubbed my jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t like the fucker, but I believe him.\u201d</p><p>I drew out of Eli\u2019s arms and paced the shop. I pressed the pads of my index fingers into my temples. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, then turned on him. \u201cI guess we\u2019d better get to your parents\u2019. We definitely need a game plan now.\u201d I moved to the stairs, but Eli stopped me, his hand firmly grasping my elbow.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t get to you, Ri,\u201d he said, an edge to his voice. \u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d I answered, and grazed his jaw with my fingertip. \u201cLet\u2019s go see what your dad says.\u201d</p><p>We were silent on the ride to Monterey Square. The September air had finally grown a little cooler\u2014not much, but a little, and it whipped at my skin as we drove through the streets. It was hard tonight, to concentrate; to block out the sounds, the smells. They assaulted me from every direction, and it was really starting to piss me off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because your mind is worrying about other things,\u201d Eli offered. \u201cIt\u2019s natural.\u201d</p><p>Nothing, I thought, was natural about any of this.</p><p>Philippe opened the door as we walked up the steps to the Dupr\u00e9 House, his face unreadable in the dim lamplight and shadows. He almost\u2014almost\u2014reminded me of that tall creepy guy from the old horror movie Phantasm. Tall, thin, with a long, structured face, gray hair, and constant expression of doom. He liked me, though\u2014I could tell. I was going to make that man smile one day. \u201cHey, Phil,\u201d I said as I passed by. He glanced at me, and I nodded. \u201c Sup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this late hour, nothing, young lady,\u201d he replied in his dry tone. \u201cThey\u2019re awaiting you in the parlor,\u201d he said. I smiled and shook my head. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>We walked in to find Luc, Phin, Gilles and Elise, Preacher and Estelle, Jack and Tuba, Zetty, and four others I didn\u2019t recognize; three guys, one girl. I surmised they were with Noah. They all regarded me, expressions unreadable. I gave a slight nod and moved to stand beside Luc. Eli stood behind me, Gilles on my other side. Noah approached Gilles first, shook his hand, took Elise\u2019s and brushed a kiss to the top of it. Then, he surprised me further by moving to Preacher and Estelle and giving them both a hug.</p><p>I had to stop and wonder if Noah was in any way related to Nyx, what with the hug-a-thon I\u2019d just witnessed.</p><p>\u201cNon, we\u2019ve just known Noah for a long time, ma ch\u00e9rie,\u201d whispered Gilles, leaning over me. \u201cNice boy, Noah.\u201d</p><p>Elise leaned around her husband and glanced at me, her elegantly coiffed ponytail barely bobbing with her movement. She nodded in agreement and smiled. \u201cHe truly is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that with or without his magic powder?\u201d I muttered, and Elise\u2019s eyes glittered, her mouth tipped into a smile.</p><p>The horny devil had even gotten to Eli\u2019s mom!</p><p>Elise leaned close to me. \u201cOnly slightly, love.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at her.</p><p>Gilles rose. \u201cMost of us know one another. Some of you I\u2019ve known for a very long time,\u201d he said, and glanced at Noah. Noah gave him a respectful nod. \u201cWe are sorry to hear of your loss. Your loss, invariably, is our loss as well. While it\u2019s our nature to honor one another\u2019s boundaries, in this we bind together. We\u2019ll do all we can to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe newling band in Charles Town is large, Monsieur,\u201d Noah said to Gilles. \u201cLast night we were outnumbered.\u201d</p><p>Gilles nodded. \u201cSpawns from the Arcoses, no doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cAs is our way, we\u2019ll attempt to gather as many in transition as possible. Some, undoubtedly, will be lost causes, I\u2019m afraid. An unavoidable mission.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cOf course. We appreciate any help you can offer, sir,\u201d he said, then glanced at me. \u201cWhat about Eli\u2019s woman?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s woman?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s more powerful than even she knows,\u201d Gilles announced, and glanced at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve only uncovered a fraction of your abilities, Riley dear. The rest will eventually surface, with experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil then?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cWill her present tendencies be able to withstand the danger? What of her brother? The newling band is led by an unknown. He has complete control over the newlings. They do any and everything that\u2019s asked of them.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve searched and come up empty each time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a little insight on that now,\u201d Eli said, stepping forward. \u201cSomehow, Valerian Arcos has a hand in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hand? We burned his head,\u201d Luc said. \u201cHow can he have anything to do with this?\u201d</p><p>Eli glanced at everyone, then turned his attention to his father. \u201cI spoke with their mother, who begged me not to kill Victorian. She said their DNA and Riley\u2019s are one. To kill Victorian could harm her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Valerian is dead,\u201d Phin said. \u201cWe all had a hand in it.\u201d</p><p>Eli nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d He looked at me, then back to Gilles. \u201cBut not before he passed his DNA on to another.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the room for several seconds. \u201cHe\u2019s been reborn in another,\u201d Gilles said, his voice stoic, deadly. \u201cAnd to destroy either will possibly destroy Riley?\u201d</p><p>Eli turned his gaze full-on to mine. \u201cOui. And I can\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, darling,\u201d Elise said kindly. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even think of such.\u201d</p><p>My insides shook\u2014literally, shook. Air squeaked through my windpipe, barely allowing enough oxygen in.</p><p>Eli\u2019s strong arms encircled me, holding me up.</p><p>\u201cOnly one ting to do, den,\u201d Preacher spoke up.</p><p>All eyes turned to the old Gullah.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta entomb dat boy. Dat Valerian. No mattah if he is inside anodder\u2019s body. We gotta find him. Curse him. And put him in da ground.\u201d</p><p>Gilles met Preacher\u2019s hard gaze. Then, he nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right, old friend. Now \u2019tis the matter of finding him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you find the band of newlings?\u201d Eli asked Noah.</p><p>Noah glanced at him. \u201cAbsolutely. Three times a week.\u201d</p><p>Phin cocked his head. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced at his group, then at Eli, then at Phin. \u201cThey gather at what used to be a church a couple of centuries ago. The bad part of the city grew around it, and it\u2019s been used as many things. Now? They conduct fights. Vampires against mortals. They\u2019re brutal.\u201d He glanced at Gilles. \u201cThey move around to different locations, but they\u2019ve been at this one for a few weeks. It\u2019s how they\u2019re weeding out the weak mortals from the strong.\u201d Noah\u2019s gaze met mine. \u201cIt\u2019s why I have to know if Riley can handle herself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gilles gave a short nod, then glanced at Preacher.</p><p>He then began to speak in French. Preacher answered likewise.</p><p>Estelle shot me a look of worry.</p> <p>This is when I knew things weren\u2019t looking all that sweet.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, calm down,\u201d Luc said quietly as he leaned over. \u201cThey\u2019re simply discussing your abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not in the discussion, then?\u201d I whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t I have a say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eli answered. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t too surprised by his answer. \u201cHow\u2019s it looking?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot too good,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Both Gilles and Preacher lifted their heads and glanced my way. Both studied, regarded, weighed. The longer they stared, the more I wanted to shout What! at the top of my lungs. Then, they put their heads together again. Discussed. Chatted. For several minutes. In French.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in,\u201d Eli finally offered.</p><p>Gilles crossed the room to stand in the center. \u201cYes, Riley, you\u2019re in. But there are stipulations, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, you will never be alone. Either Eli, Jean-Luc, S\u00e9raphin, or Noah will always be with you.\u201d He shot a glance at my brother. \u201cSame with young Seth, and Zetty.\u201d Gilles\u2019 gaze lingered on Zetty. \u201cYou may be an intimidating mortal young man, but, after all, you are still a mortal. Even with your formidable tendencies, you can be destroyed.\u201d</p><p>Zetty nodded, silent.</p><p>\u201cIf there are any newlings or those in the quickening that can be spared, they must be gathered and brought to Da Island for rehabilitation. The fewer killings, the better. Understood?\u201d</p> <p>Multiple heads nodded.</p><p>The room tilted.</p><p>I blinked, shook my head, and blinked again. Gilles\u2019 voice became muffled, far away, until the words melded together, now meaningless. I staggered, leaned against Eli, and held my stomach as he whipped me around. As I stared up into his face, my eyes locked on his mouth; his lips moved frantically, speaking frantically and fast. No sound emerged. I understood nothing. Then, as if someone pulled a shade down in a bright room, shadows slipped over my lids, and I saw nothing but blackness.</p><p>I knew then he was about to kill again.</p><p>As the shadow slowly lifted, I blinked several times to clear my vision. The lights were dim\u2014so dim I could still barely make out shapes. Music thumped hard all around me. I recognized it\u2014\u201cSo What, I Lied\u201d by Sick Puppies. People glanced my way, barely noticing me at all as they moved to the music. Lights flickered, flashed, and I continued through the thick throng of clubbers, to the bar near the back. I sat. I wasn\u2019t alone long.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d a girl said. She wore a short purple glittered minidress with a zipper pulled down the front, exposing a swell of pushed-up breasts. She wore tall spiked black heels, a lot of makeup, and had her bleached blond hair piled loosely atop her head. \u201cCome on, baby. Let\u2019s dance.\u201d</p><p>Delicate hands tipped with red acrylic fingernails grasped my hand and pulled me back into the throng of dancing people. The hand she touched wasn\u2019t my hand; the ass she grabbed wasn\u2019t mine either. When I looked down, the hand holding her waist was large, big-knuckled, rough. We began to move; she seductively, brushing against me, her tongue darting out to lick her painted lips. Holding my gaze, she grasped the zipper and pulled lower, allowing more of her breasts to spill. She grinned, shimmied down my front, and slowly raised her body, dragging it against mine. All I could do was cringe in revulsion because, although the body wasn\u2019t mine, I felt his emotions. His cock was hard beneath the leather pants he wore. The girl\u2019s gaze lowered and she noticed, turned around, and pressed her ass close.</p><p>Hands not mine slipped around her rib cage, her hips, and pulled her against his hard cock. The girl squirmed and wiggled; then her head fell back and she laughed. She was wasted, her gaze hazy, dim. She looked up at me backward, her eyes squinted, concentrating, focused.</p> <p>I lowered my head, said something in her ear, and no matter how hard I screamed, I was trapped, somewhere back at the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019, floating in some weird purgatory, and, helpless, all I could do was watch. Nothing I could do would change the situation. Smiling, laughing, the girl grabbed my hand and stumbled through the club. Then, everything began to slow; the noise in the club dulled to a low hum, a jumble of uttered words and muffled music that I didn\u2019t recognize or understand. She turned, smiling through her high, hazy and drug-induced, and although her lips moved, no words came out. She stumbled, laughed, but I heard nothing. As we pushed out into the night, no sounds greeted my ears, no smells infiltrated my senses, and although a streetlamp lit the path directly in front of the entrance, it dulled to darkness. I saw nothing; I heard nothing. The girl in front of me disappeared. Blackness engulfed me.</p><p>Like a burst of energy, a new sensation filled me; a craving I couldn\u2019t define, driven by lust and desire. In the darkness I groped hungrily for it, grew angry when I didn\u2019t find it, sighed and groaned when I finally did. My fingers sought and found skin; immediately I knew I had to have it. I pulled hard, wanting it now, wanting it fiercely, and when it resisted, my anger grew. I reached, found a solid chest, sank my fingers into rock shoulders and shoved, hard\u2014and followed. With my hands I felt for lips, found them, and devoured them with my own, deepening the kiss, tasting with my tongue, my hand holding the body fast, hard; refusing escape. I grabbed a firm jaw and held it still as I continued to ravage with my mouth, a need so fierce building within me that I had to quench it. Quench it now. Quench it yester-freaking-day.</p><p>The body tried to leave; not happening! I reached, grabbed, found a handful of thick ... ropes? No, hair. Hair ropes? Whatever. I yanked hard, and the body emitted a low groan.</p><p>\u201cRiley! Stop it!\u201d</p><p>My eyes popped open, and as my foggy vision cleared, my consciousness regained. I don\u2019t know how long that took\u2014several seconds. Maybe a full minute? Eventually it happened, though. Now, in the present, in the flesh, my faculties united, I stared around the room.</p><p>And then directly into the seductive, mercury eyes of Noah freaking Miles.</p><p>Eli stood, staring at me over Noah\u2019s shoulder, eyes flashing, brows furrowed.,</p><p>The scent of ... something sharp caught my senses.</p><p>A few chuckles sounded in the room.</p><p>With a jerk, I let Noah\u2019s dreadlocks loose. Dick.</p><p>\u201cOw, babe,\u201d he said, holding his head and grinning. \u201cEasy on the dreads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat ... just happened?\u201d I asked, fuming. Raising my fingers to my lips, I pressed against them. They felt numb. And they burned a little.</p><p>More chuckles sounded.</p><p>\u201cNoah used his special powers and pulled you from that horrible vision you were in the middle of,\u201d Luc said, draping an arm over my shoulder and inclining his head in Noah\u2019s direction. \u201cEli tried first but was, surprisingly, unsuccessful. You should thank Noah for saving you.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the silver hoop in Luc\u2019s lip and pulled. \u201cOw, ow, ow,\u201d he laughed/cried. I let go and elbowed him in the gut. I know it didn\u2019t hurt him, but he had the good grace to grunt and pretend anyway. He stood, grinning.</p><p>Then I turned to Gilles, then to Preacher. \u201cSorry for ... whatever I just did.\u201d I knew what I just did. I\u2019d almost fornicated with freaking Noah, right in the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 freaking parlor, with everyone, including Eli, freaking watching\u2014including Seth. I turned to him quickly. \u201cSorry you had to see that, Bro.\u201d</p><p>He exaggerated a shudder. \u201cScarred for life.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and looked hard at Noah. He shrugged. I sought Eli\u2019s gaze. I mouthed, I\u2019m sorry. With a quick snap, he punched Noah in the jaw. Then, satisfied, he gave me a surprise reaction. He grinned. Noah merely rubbed his jaw and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see, ma ch\u00e9rie?\u201d Gilles asked, gracefully drawing the conversation to more important things.</p><p>Eli stood behind me again, his hand on my lower back. I rubbed my forehead, ran my hand to the back of my neck, and remembered. \u201cWhen my vision cleared, I was in a club\u2014I didn\u2019t recognize it. Packed with people, though, and the girl ...\u201d I stood in the center of the parlor, squeezing my eyes shut but seeing. \u201cShe was typical of his kills\u2014young, midtwenties maybe, bleached blond hair, super short dress, super high heels, and super, super wasted.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cShe had no clue at all about who or what he was. She was leading him out of the club when\u201d\u2014I glanced at Noah and narrowed my eyes\u2014\u201cNoah rescued me.\u201d</p><p>Noah simply shrugged and smiled.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, she has met her fate by now,\u201d Gilles said. He clasped his hands behind his back and glanced around the room. \u201cThere is nothing we can do from here. You leave collectively in the morning, unless some of you wish to go tonight.\u201d</p><p>Noah gave Gilles a short nod. \u201cMy group will head back tonight, but we thank you for the invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin Garr, he will have somethin\u2019 for you dis night, right?\u201d Preacher said. \u201cYou know where to meet him? Pick it up, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Preacher met his gaze. \u201cGood, den. You take it and keep it wit you.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cThanks, Preach. We will.\u201d</p><p>Preacher turned to Eli. \u201cJack and Tuba, dey go wit you in da morning, dat\u2019s right. Dey stays wit Riley along wit da rest of you fellas. I don want her near dat fightin\u2019 by herself. Seth neider. Zetty goes, too.\u201d</p><p>Eli nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>With his hand to the back of his neck, Preacher looked at me. \u201cDon you be actin\u2019 crazy, girl. Dat boy Eli, he\u2019ll be wit you. You got dese boys here, too, and Jack and Tuba. You don go actin\u2019 foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I won\u2019t,\u201d I promised, and turned to Gilles. \u201cWill it be okay here? With all of us gone?\u201d</p><p>Gilles smiled and crossed the room, took my hands in his, and pressed his lips to my knuckles. I found it strange how it hardly even crossed my mind that a vampire\u2019s fangs slipped so close to my skin. \u201cYoung lady, I may be older, but I have a few good fights still in me, as does my Elise. We have your Preacher and his kin here, as well as their magic. We\u2019ll be more than fine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. \u201cOkay. I believe you,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you\u2019re old at all.\u201d</p><p>Gilles\u2019 eyes twinkled.</p><p>I suddenly remembered what he could turn into. Any doubts were immediately stricken from my mind.</p> <p>\u201cBon,\u201d he said, with a slight nod. \u201cI\u2019m glad you see it my way.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my gaze and gave him a mock frown. He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cAnd now that Nyx knows of us,\u201d Gilles continued, \u201cwe\u2019ll take care of her and help with your business.\u201d</p><p>I again nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Before we left, I hugged Preacher, then pulled a still-worried Estelle into a hug. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Grandma,\u201d I said, crooning into her shoulder. \u201cI have the best guardians in the world right beside me, dat\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>Estelle\u2019s face, darker than usual in the dimmed parlor, gleamed perfect ebony. Her eyes widened, her teeth shined in a large, comforting smile. \u201cI know dat, baby.\u201d She grasped my face between her aged hands. She gave a firm shake, squishing my cheeks. All at once I thought of how I would now outlive her by God only knew how many years. \u201cYou listen to dem Dupr\u00e9 boys and dat Josie, and dat odder one dere, Noah. Dey will keep you and your brodder safe. Come back to me, girl. I mean dat ting. You my baby.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, my cheeks squishing even more. \u201cI will. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Estelle hugged Seth. \u201cYou, too, boy. Keep a good eye on your sister. She got dat hard head, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Seth said, and kissed her cheek. \u201cI love you, Grandmodder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, boy.\u201d She swatted his backside. \u201cNow git on dere. You got work to do.\u201d</p><p>After good-byes, we all left.</p> <p>The ride back to my place felt shorter than usual. \u201cEli\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to say a word, Riley,\u201d he said, then slipped his hand over my thigh. \u201cNoah pulled you out. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d He smiled, his eyes dark orbs in the shadows. \u201cBesides, I got mine in. We\u2019re cool.\u201d</p><p>He was referring to that pop he gave Noah on the jaw. \u201cOkay,\u201d I answered, and downshifted as we came to a light. I stopped the Jeep. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eli leaned over and covered my mouth with his. I instantly melted into his kiss, and only the honk of the car\u2019s horn behind us pulled me back to the present. He smiled seductively. \u201cDrive.\u201d</p><p>If the air hadn\u2019t cooled my skin, I would\u2019ve had to fan myself.</p><p>Once back at Inksomnia, I glanced around my living room and marveled at how many vampires could fill a small historic building-turned-apartment. I was introduced to Noah\u2019s people\u2014Saul, Tate, Cafrey, and Jenna\u2014and they left for Charleston. I figured I\u2019d get to know them all better once there. Also crammed into my apartment were Zetty, Jack, and Tuba, along with all the Dupr\u00e9s; .a lot of big guys taking up a lot of space.</p><p>On the way out, Noah stopped at the door, turned, and looked at me. \u201cFor the record,\u201d he said, his smile crooked, arrogant, his strange silver eyes twinkling. \u201cYou\u2019re a helluva kisser. Ever get tired of Dupr\u00e9? ...\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhatever. Get out. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>As I closed and locked the door, his laugh sounded in the merchant\u2019s drive.</p><p>Upstairs, I made plans with Eli, his siblings, Seth, and Zetty, and Jack and Tuba. We\u2019d leave for Charleston at daybreak. We were staying in a house on the battery belonging to a friend of Eli\u2019s, although, according to Phin, we probably wouldn\u2019t see much of it.</p><p>Apparently, we\u2019d be spending a lot of time running the streets.</p><p>I hoped we\u2019d be gone only a few days. I wanted to stop the monster and break up the newling band, and I wanted to do it yesterday.</p><p>\u201cI gotta get a little sleep,\u201d I said, and said good night. Eli moved with me.</p><p>The others whistled. I ignored them.</p><p>I threw some stuff into two backpacks. One was for clothes and a few necessities; the other was for my sheaths and blades. Eli leaned against the wall, watching in silence. When I finished, he pulled me against him. \u201cSlow down, ch\u00e9rie,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want this to be over,\u201d I answered, and leaned against him. \u201cI have to make a call.\u201d</p><p>I made a quick call to Nyx; she was, as I knew she\u2019d be, totally cool with taking on the business until we wrapped things up in Charleston. She\u2019d take Chaz home with her after work and keep him at her place. I assured her I\u2019d be careful.</p><p>Zetty, Jack, and Tuba went next door to stay with Preacher and Estelle. Seth and Josie took Chaz out for a walk, and I showered. Exhaustion overcame me, and I hoped like hell I wouldn\u2019t have any more dreams or murderous visions. I was simply too tired. I showered, changed, and when I finished, Eli was waiting for me. I crossed the room, my towel loosely wrapped around my body, and when Eli pulled me to him, I went willingly. I forgot my exhaustion when Eli\u2019s touch seared me, awakening my desires. He tugged at the towel, and it dropped. His hands found my waist, moved up along my ribs, cupped my breasts, and kissed with silent passion. Shadows played across his face in the darkness of my room, and slowly, I undressed him. Taut muscles covered by silky flawless skin played beneath my palms, and when I traced the lines of his abdomen, he scooped me up and laid me against the pillows stacked on my bed. Without a word, without a sound, he made love to me, his eyes never leaving mine. When he entered me, I gasped, and he covered the sound with his mouth in an erotic kiss that sent me soaring. We moved together, exquisite friction, until the orgasm built with such ferocity, I lost my breath. Slowly, we both came down; his lips dragged across mine in a possessive, delicious brand. We settled in, slumber once again pulling at me, and with Eli wrapped around me, I drifted into a peaceful state. His fingers stroked the skin of my stomach, traced the dragons on my arms, the wings at my cheek. He murmured words in French; I had no idea what they were. I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe, love,\u201d he said against my throat. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>The urge to tell Eli how I felt about him overwhelmed me. But sleep came too fast. Soon, I thought. I\u2019d tell him soon.</p><p>Once asleep, I did dream, but thankfully, it was just of something out of the blue and bizarre, with no meaning. At least, I thought it had no meaning. It was a dark and stormy night\u2014literally\u2014and for some reason I was lying on the ground, in tall, wet grass\u2014a forest maybe? It was winter, the trees bare and stark, the forest bleak, the air cold, the moon huge and round, like a harvest moon. Thunder boomed, lightning flashed, and rain splattered down. Staring up at the spindly, leafless branches that weaved and stretched above me, I saw in the moonlight a single bird, crawling across the branch.</p><p>Crawling? Birds didn\u2019t crawl. How retarded. What did that even mean? I guess anything was better than watching a vampire rip into a victim\u2019s heart.</p><p>After that, I slept. And while I slept I must have done some serious soul-searching, a little dwelling on certain things that pissed me off, and nursed a lot of hatred toward whoever\u2014whatever\u2014was behind the Charleston kills. I slept all the way until my alarm went off at five a.m. When it did go off, I awoke refreshed, edgy, determined.</p><p>And ready to kick some dirty nasty vampire ass.</p><p>Part Seven</p><p>BLOODLUST</p><p>\u201cAll the ways you wish you could be, that\u2019s me. I look the way you wanna look, I fuck the way you wanna fuck, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways you are not.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Tyler Durden, Fight Club</p><p>\u201cThe word monster means something a little different for everyone, I guess, but let me tell ya\u2014to me, it defines every vile, fanatic, horrific dark evil you could possibly ever conjure up. It\u2019s the thing that wracks your body with unstoppable quivers, terrors so mind-numbing you pee your pants just thinking about it. That\u2019s him\u2014the monster whose feeds I\u2019ve been witnessing. I haven\u2019t peed my pants yet, but I damn sure almost did. Never has something petrified me so badly. I\u2019m now not only hesitant to fall asleep, but to not fall asleep, because that bastard shows up at any given time, day or night. It\u2019s dragged bad memories of my past out of the dusty recesses of my once-juvenile mind and pushed them to the surface. I\u2019m seeing my mother\u2019s death all over again; feeling her lifeless body limp in my arms, her wide dull stare fixed but not seeing. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m losing my friggin\u2019 mind, and to top it off, I\u2019m faced with fighting a fuck-load of newlings in some sadistic fight club. Bullshit, man. Simply put, bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>The TV was on in the living room; I knew the Dupr\u00e9s were just chillin\u2019 while the mortals rested. I rose, worked out on the bag for thirty minutes, showered, and dressed. As I stood in my bra and panties, I adjusted my blade straps; one on each upper thigh, inner and outer; one on each calf, inner and outer; one at my lower back, one on each hip. I stared at myself in the full-length mirror, satisfied that the lightweight sheaths Preacher had had made for me out of moleskin were adjusted just right, the weight of the blades perfect, easily retractable. Turning halfway, I stared at the reflection of my back; the dragon tattooed up my spine, down my arms, the black angel wing at the corner of my eye, and me, standing in black bra and a black thong with eleven pure silver knives strapped to various body parts. I had fifty more in my bag.</p><p>I confess, I looked badass\u2014Marvel badass.</p><p>I prayed I could be Marvel badass when faced with a dozen vampires.</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Eli said, studying me from the doorway through my mirrored reflection. \u201cAnd you\u2019re definitely Marvel badass.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cThanks.\u201d Seeing him there shot a thrill through my insides.</p><p>Eli smiled wider. Sexy as hell, that one.</p><p>I pulled on a pair of loose knees-blown-out boyfriend jeans that sat low on my hips, a black tank, and a lightweight black Adidas jacket. No need for a trip to Mullet\u2019s this go-round. I was dressed for comfort, movement, jumping, stabbing, throwing. Pulling my hair into a ponytail, my feet into my worn black Vans, I grabbed my bags and we left the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zetty, Jack, and Tuba seemed to be waiting for me to appear around the corner; they were already staring at me as I entered the living room. All gave a nod.</p><p>\u201cHey guys,\u201d I offered, then found Seth, seated on the floor with Josie playing Burnout 3 on Xbox 360. Phin and Luc were at the kitchen table, both with their special V8\u2019, and Luc inclined his head for me to join. I walked over and set my bags on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWe ready or what?\u201d I asked. Chaz walked over, nuzzled my hand, and I scrubbed the fur on his noggin. He\u2019d been fed, watered, and walked, but the old guy just needed a little reassurance. Moving to the fridge, I opened it, pushed past the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 bag-o-meals, grabbed the OJ, and swigged from the carton. Sweet juice and pulp filled my mouth and slid down my throat.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019re the sheaths Preach made for your blades?\u201d Phin asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cFeels great. I barely even know they\u2019re there.\u201d I took another swig of juice. I knew Zetty carried silver; was pretty sure Jack and Tuba did, too, amongst other Gullah stuffs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, mine, too,\u201d said Seth, never even glancing away from his game.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Phin said. \u201cJack brought his truck. Tuba will ride with him. Josie and Seth can ride with me. We\u2019ll split the bikes and gear between the two trucks. Luc and Zetty can ride with you and Eli,\u201d he said to me. I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll drive straight there and set up,\u201d Eli said. \u201cThen a quick tour of the city.\u201d He regarded me. \u201cMaybe not so quick. How long has it been since you were in Charleston?\u201d</p> <p>I thought. \u201cA while. Maybe last June? Even then, I didn\u2019t know my way around town, except how to get to the battery, and city market.\u201d</p><p>Eli regarded me. \u201cYou\u2019ll know it well by tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess I will,\u201d I said. I squatted down to say good-bye to Chaz, holding his fuzzy face between my hands. \u201cI promise you some quality time when I get home. In the meanwhile, you be good for Nyx. Go take a nap; she\u2019ll be here before you wake up,\u201d I said to the dog, and allowed his big, slobbery lick across my cheek. I kissed his muzzle, scrubbed him between the ears, and stood. I grabbed my bags and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Eli quickly relieved me of them. \u201cI got these,\u201d he said. Even when going to fight vamps, he was a gentleman.</p><p>We hit the lights and left. Outside, a thick, muggy fog hung over the city and wrapped around us. I had the top off the Jeep; I preferred it that way. Within fifteen minutes we had both Phin\u2019s and Luc\u2019s bikes and gear loaded and were pulling out onto Bay Street. Phin led the way in his black Ford F-150, both bikes strapped in the bed, followed by Jack in his wicked-restored blue \u201959 Chevrolet, and trailed by me.</p><p>\u201cNice creepy morning, huh?\u201d Luc said from behind me as we sat at the red light. \u201cReminds me of the old days, before electricity. Nothing but gas lamps throughout the city.\u201d He looked at me in the rearview mirror. \u201cYou could hear them hissing as you passed by. Remember that, Eli? Ahh, the clop-clop of the horse\u2019s hooves on the cobbles, the hissing gas lights.\u201d He leaned his head on the seat rest and sighed. He turned and looked at me. \u201cNot that I\u2019d give up cell phones and hot water for it.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t blame ya.\u201d</p> <p>Zetty remained silent.</p><p>\u201cThe hissing gas lights were pretty cool,\u201d Eli offered.</p><p>The light changed, I eased off the clutch, built up speed, and shifted into second gear. It wasn\u2019t light out yet, and a filmy haze hung over the city. I felt irritable, anxious, and edgy. I wanted this to be over. I missed ... normalcy. And it was time for my period.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Luc said, nodding, apparently reading my thoughts. \u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a glare. \u201cPut your seat belt on.\u201d I shot Zetty a similar one. \u201cYou, too.\u201d A final one I shot at Eli, who\u2019d already started to pull his on. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d He merely grinned.</p><p>I glared at Luc in the rearview mirror. In the early-morning light, his skin nearly blended with the fog. He smiled and did as I asked. \u201cSure thing, babe.\u201d Zetty also complied, but silently. I learned that most of the time the Tibetan didn\u2019t have a whole lot to say.</p><p>Once we pulled out onto Interstate 16, I flipped the stereo on, shoved in a Drowning Pool CD, and cranked the volume to rise over the wind. \u201cMore Than Worthless\u201d rocked us all the way to the Interstate 95 exit where we headed north. More than once I glanced at Eli, who silently returned my look. His hand rested on my thigh. We didn\u2019t talk. Luc was pretending to be asleep; I suppose he was simply enjoying the ride. His crazy long hair blew all over the place, a content, peaceful look settling into his flawless features. And as the morning light grew stronger, it winked off the silver hoop in his lip.</p><p>\u201cFlawless, huh?\u201d he hollered over the wind. \u201cThanks, babe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay out of my noggin,\u201d I yelled back. He smiled. We continued on.</p><p>Ten miles later, my fuel light flashed. \u201cWanna call Phin and Jack? I need gas,\u201d I said. Luc pulled his cell from the pocket of his baggy cargo shorts and called his brother. At the next exit, I pulled into a Sunoco and stopped at one of the empty pumps. Phin, Jack, and Tuba pulled in and parked near the exit. Eli unbuckled his belt to get out. \u201cI got it,\u201d I said, and waved him down. \u201cWon\u2019t take but a sec.\u201d Eli stared at me for a moment, then gave a nod, and I slid from my seat. Only then did I notice the debit card feature wasn\u2019t working. \u201cPlease see manager inside\u201d was written on little white pieces of paper, on all the pumps. \u201cDamn,\u201d I muttered, tempted to drive off and choose another gas station. Instead, I started across the parking lot. One pickup truck and a semitruck, parked in the back, were the only other vehicles around. I pushed inside and walked up to the counter where a middle-aged woman, rail-thin with hard life written all over her, gave me a nod.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d she said in a smoker\u2019s raspy voice. Her gaze went to my dragon-inked arms.</p><p>I handed her my debit card. \u201cForty on number three,\u201d I said, then thought better of it. \u201cWait.\u201d My ravenous appetite kicked in, and I suddenly wanted junk. Turning up the candy aisle, I grabbed a handful of Chick-O-Sticks, a bag of salt and vinegar chips, and a package of those cupcakes with waxy icing on top and gooey white cream in the middle. While debating on a pouch of spicy roasted peanuts, I felt a presence behind me. I glanced; a pair of big, dirty knobby-toed boots stood close. Too close.</p><p>It happened all too fast.</p><p>\u201cDrop the shit and get up. Nice and slow,\u201d the voice belonging to the nasty boots said. His hand grasped my ponytail and pulled, slowly but firmly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t cause a scene. I know you got boys outside.\u201d</p><p>I momentarily closed my eyes. \u201cAre you freaking kidding me?\u201d I said under my breath. I left my junk food in a pile on the floor and slowly rose. \u201cDude, you really don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d the voice commanded. \u201cTo the back of the store. Exit door by the head. Do it now, bitch.\u201d I felt the cold press of steel against my ribs through my shirt. \u201cI\u2019ll stick you if you make a sound.\u201d</p><p>Even before I\u2019d been introduced to my new tendencies, or to the vampiric world, humans hadn\u2019t scared me. This guy, with his knife that he\u2019d stick me with, damn sure didn\u2019t scare me. He was a loser punk who hung out at gas stations robbing people on the interstate. He was the very least of my problems. But something wasn\u2019t right. It wasn\u2019t three o\u2019clock in the morning. It wasn\u2019t the middle of the night. It was like when you noticed a nocturnal animal, like a raccoon, out in the middle of the day, you knew something was wrong. That raccoon had to be sick. This guy had to be sick. Not wanting to cause the cashier any stress, I did as he asked; I\u2019d take care of him out back, get my junk food, gas, and leave.</p><p>I eased out the exit door, and a second later, the idiot followed.</p><p>Before the door closed, I swung my leg high and around, knocked the knife from his hand, and shoved him hard against the concrete wall. It was the first look I\u2019d had at him, other than his booted feet. My height, stocky, and appearing to be late twenties, he wore an Atlanta Braves baseball cap pulled down over a burred head of sandy hair. He wore shades.</p><p>Just that fast, he turned and knocked me to the ground. I managed to sweep him with my leg before I hit. I landed on my backside. He landed on his backside. His shades fell off. Opaque eyes stared hard and angry back at me.</p><p>Well damn. Didn\u2019t see that one coming. Frickin\u2019 frackin\u2019 newling at the Sunoco. Go figure. He must\u2019ve gotten loose from whatever changed him. Great. Freeroaming newlings.</p><p>I leapt up just as he lunged; we met head-on. He was wild, uncontrolled, unaware of his powers. I was not. Just as his fangs dropped, I reached for the blade sheathed at my back. The silver flashed in the early-morning light, and the newling\u2019s eyes widened. A nasty snarl curled his inhuman lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her,\u201d he murmured, and shoved me.</p><p>Just then Eli appeared, Luc and Zetty right behind him.</p><p>The newling\u2019s eyes grazed both, then back to me. \u201cLater,\u201d he said, his voice not matching the newling face. With a fierce shove, he flung me against the wall. By the time I scrambled up, he was across the parking lot and disappearing into the dense copse of tall planted pines behind the Sunoco.</p><p>Grasping my knees, I breathed hard, catching my breath. First, I kept my eyes trained at the tree line. Then, the silence drew my attention to my parking lot companions.</p><p>Luc stood, frowning. Zetty stood, frowning more.</p><p>Eli took off after the newling.</p><p>\u201cWhat the freak is wrong with you, Riley?\u201d Luc said. He shoved his fingers through his hair, staring hard at me. \u201cDo you honestly think you can handle everything by yourself?\u201d</p><p>I rose and met his gaze. \u201cSure. Why not?\u201d</p><p>Luc continued to stare for several seconds, as though trying to see something, then blinked. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d</p><p>I jammed the blade back in its sheath. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Luc shook his head. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see a head harder than Eli\u2019s. Do you have a problem asking anyone for help, or just from me? Or Eli?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrugged. \u201cI had him, Luc. If I\u2019d needed help, I would have definitely asked.\u201d I scratched my jaw. \u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019re her.\u2019 What\u2019s that supposed to mean? And why was he out here in the early morning, alone? Don\u2019t newlings usually run in groups? At least, for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually,\u201d Luc said, and led the way into the store. \u201cBut we\u2019re dealing with Romanian magic\u2014or so Ned says, and I tend to believe him. There\u2019s no telling what we\u2019re up against anymore.\u201d He rounded on me as we stopped at the pile of junk food sitting on the floor where I left it. \u201cWhich is why you freaking need to call for help\u201d\u2014he tapped my temple\u2014\u201cwhen something\u2019s going down. Got it? Or do you really want to see Eli kick my ass?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Zetty, whose dark gaze remained fixed on mine. He merely shrugged.</p> <p>A cynical laugh slipped from my throat. \u201cWhatever, Dupr\u00e9.\u201d I bent down and gathered my junk food, then headed to the cooler. \u201cI gotta tell ya\u2014I\u2019m pretty sick of hearing how Eli\u2019s going to kick everyone\u2019s asses for me getting into trouble.\u201d I flung open the cooler, grabbed a Yoo-hoo, and let the door slam shut. \u201cWhere is he, anyway? It\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>Eli walked through the front door. He shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s fast. Got away.\u201d</p><p>Luc and Zetty followed me up to the front. The cashier, who\u2019d stepped out the front to smoke, was just making her way back behind the counter. I set my junk food on the counter. \u201cYou can add this stuff to the gas,\u201d I said. She rang it up, looking at me uncertainly the whole time.</p><p>\u201cReceipt?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, \u201cI responded, scooped up my stuff, and left.</p> <p>My cell vibrated. I dumped my junk food in my driver\u2019s seat and grasped the phone from my back pocket. I glanced at the screen and rolled my eyes when I saw Phin\u2019s name. I answered. \u201cHey.\u201d Eli glared at me.</p><p>\u201cThe next time you pull something like that, Riley I will personally kick your ass,\u201d Phin said.</p><p>I hung the phone up and flashed him the bird.</p><p>I was really, really getting tired of all the ass-kicking threats.</p><p>Already, I was getting irritated, and it wasn\u2019t even eight o\u2019clock in the morning yet. I opened my gas cap, lifted the fuel nozzle, and jammed it in. \u201cAren\u2019t we going to go after him?\u201d I asked about the newling. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty close to Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eli said, leaning against the Jeep\u2019s fender. \u201cI told Papa. He and my mother will take care of it. Just like I will take care of you.\u201d</p> <p>I eyed Luc in the rearview; his grin spoke volumes. Finished pumping, I stuck the nozzle back in the pump, screwed the gas cap back on, and looked at all three of my Jeep occupants. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d already had enough newling excitement for one morning.</p><p>Twenty-seven miles later we merged onto US 17 North. I\u2019d shucked out of my jacket, and cars filed down both lanes. Palm trees and live oaks dripping with Spanish moss gathered along the highway, along with the occasional Gullah woman, sitting out beneath a pitched half tent, or a beach umbrella, in a plastic and metal lawn chair with a quilt spread on the ground and dozens of sweetgrass baskets for sale. Small country stores advertising homemade peach preserves and boiled peanuts, along with fruit stands, gathered at the edge of the highway. In between those fruit stands were pieces of plywood nailed to trees: PEACHES, WATERMELONS, PECANS, FIVE MILES. It was all unique, very South Carolina. Very Charleston.</p><p>\u201cYou like it here,\u201d Eli said, peering at me behind a pair of aviators.</p><p>I regarded him behind my own pair of shades and smiled. \u201cI remember my mom taking Seth and me here, to Folly Beach, when we were very young,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019d stay at the Holiday Inn, and Seth and I would hang out at the ice machine, eating it by the handfuls. Nice memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good to have,\u201d he answered. \u201cHold on to them.\u201d</p><p>It was the best piece of advice I\u2019d been given in a while.</p><p>By the time we drove the sixty-plus miles to Charleston, the sun drove harshly into the open top of my Jeep. Overhead, white fluffy clouds drifted in a sky of pure blue, and the breeze that whipped at my face and my ponytail, felt warm, at times smoldering\u2014typical dog days of summer. One would never think such ease and beauty would lead to immortal monsters jabbing their fangs into the hearts of humans, or crazy vampire cult fight clubs taking place while the city slept. Or worse\u2014newlings hanging out at the Sunoco, waiting for victims. Fucked up, I tell ya.</p> <p>More palms and mossy oaks stood along old neighborhood streets as we hit the historic district. Spearing the sky was the tall, spindly spire of St. Michael\u2019s, and farther along Church Street, the well-known and aged French Huguenot Church. I downshifted with the slower traffic along Market Street, glancing over at the Gullah women and their wares in the city market. Sweetgrass baskets of all shapes and sizes and strip quilts covered the market stands, filled with goods varying from fruit preserves to handmade jewelry. We didn\u2019t stop; instead, we continued toward the harbor, following Phin, east of the Ashley River and all the way to South Battery. We pulled in behind the two trucks Phin and Jack were driving. We were parked on the driveway of a large, white, three-story historic home. It looked like something out of Southern Living magazine. I\u2019m talking full-front verandas, large-paddled ceiling fans, white rocking chairs, and dozens of huge green Boston ferns, and flanked by tall palms, crepe myrtle trees, and aged magnolias with large, waxy green leaves. It sat in the famous line of battery houses overlooking Charleston Harbor. We pulled around back and parked in the shade. I threw the Jeep into neutral and yanked the emergency brake.</p><p>I looked at the battery mansion before us. \u201cWhose place is this?\u201d</p><p>Eli looked at me over his shades. \u201cBelongs to Jake Andorra, but he won\u2019t be here. It\u2019ll just be us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019s Jake Andorra if he\u2019s not here?\u201d I asked, unfastening my seat belt and sliding out the Jeep\u2019s door.</p><p>Luc grinned and answered. \u201cLondon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ... how long has Jake Andorra been dead?\u201d I continued.</p><p>\u201cAbout four hundred and sixty years,\u201d Eli said with a laugh. \u201cGood thing he\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, pushing my shades up into my hair.</p><p>Eli stared at me for a moment, his grin widening. \u201cHe\u2019d like you too much.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Eli grabbed my bags and his from the backseat and rounded the Jeep; Luc did the same, as did the ever-silent Zetty. We walked toward the others. I glanced at Luc. \u201cAnd does he drink V8\u2019 like the Dupr\u00e9s, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d Luc replied. I couldn\u2019t tell by his expression what that meant exactly, so I dropped it.</p><p>Phin, Josie, and Seth, loaded down with backpacks, and Jack and Tuba, loaded down with ... something, turned to us as we walked up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get our gear inside. Zetty, Jack, Tuba, and Josie will make the place safe while you and Seth learn the city,\u201d Phin said. He stared at me. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave been,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Seth answered. He glanced at me and smiled. I can\u2019t say I was happy at all to have my baby brother facing fight club vamps, not to mention be in the same city as the monster in my visions. All I can say is that his tendencies were smack-daddy kick-ass, and to have him backing me up made me feel a helluva lot better.</p><p>With a nod, Phin led the way into Jake Andorra\u2019s mansion.</p><p>Inside, everything was spotless. Yet empty. Vaulted ceilings and an open plan made it look even emptier. Just at first glance, as Seth and I walked through to the second level, I noticed no photographs; very little home d\u00e9cor\u2014a vase here, a plant there, probably fake\u2014and everything squeaky clean. Yet empty. It was a fully stocked home with no personal touches. Upstairs, the rooms were massive. Phin led us past a mammoth library that I barely glimpsed. Then, into my room; our room, rather\u2014mine and Eli\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHome sweet home, Riley,\u201d he said, then inclined his head to Seth. \u201cCome on. Yours is across and down the hall.\u201d Seth grinned and wagged his brows at me, adjusted both packs on his shoulders, and followed Phin out.</p><p>Any woman would just melt in a house like this. I glanced around, only slightly miffed that this was no vacay but instead, a vamp hunt. But day-yum, it should be. In another life, maybe. The room held an enormous king bed piled high with pillows and topped with a down comforter, fireplace, ceiling fan, and various pieces of antique furniture. A wicker love seat sat close to the white-painted French doors leading to the veranda outside the room. I dumped my stuff on the floor next to the bed. I wasn\u2019t an indulger, but I couldn\u2019t help opening the door and taking a step out. The air smelled like home, heavy and tinged with brine. I breathed it in and took in the view. Charleston Harbor was just across the way, and, in the distance, boats dotted the water. Nice. It was ... nice. With a deep inhalation and slow exhalation, I resigned myself to doing what I did, being who I was.</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Eli asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady, guys?\u201d Seth asked from the door.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Bro,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>After a quick trip to the bathroom, we headed downstairs and rounded the corner just in time to see Luc lift a small vial to his mouth. I sidled up next to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that stuff?\u201d</p><p>Luc grinned. \u201cPreacher gave it to us. It masks our origins to other vampires and allows us to slip into their zone without being detected.\u201d He slurped the last drop and set the vial on the counter. \u201cLasts for about three days,\u201d he said. He handed Eli a vial.</p><p>\u201cYou have more, right?\u201d I asked. Three days wasn\u2019t a long time.</p><p>Phin walked up, Luc tossed him a vial, and he and Eli downed theirs in one sip. \u201cYes, we have more. Preacher gave us a decent supply.\u201d He wiped his mouth and set his vial next to Luc\u2019s. \u201cAnd this is our second vial. Took the first one a few days ago. You two ready to learn the city?\u201d He glanced at Seth and me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked at my brother, who seemed overly eager. \u201cYep,\u201d I answered, and we headed outside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sitting this one out,\u201d Eli said. \u201cI have some things to get in order with Noah.\u201d He kissed me, and the others made goofy noises. \u201cSee ya in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I answered, and gave him a saucy smile.</p> <p>Jack and Tuba had unloaded the bikes. I rode with Luc; Seth with Phin. Before Seth slung a leg over Phin\u2019s bike seat, I stopped him with a quick pat-down. Seth\u2019s green gaze, slightly humored, met mine.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got my silver, Sis. Don\u2019t worry so much,\u201d he said, then kissed my nose, pushed my glasses down and in front of my eyes, and slid his shades on. Phin handed him a half helmet, despite the no-helmet law of South Carolina, and Seth snugged it in place.</p><p>My brother looked and acted way older than fifteen these days.</p><p>\u201cJust checking,\u201d I answered, then threw my leg over Luc\u2019s bike seat. He turned, handed me my half helmet, and grinned. \u201cLaw or not, I\u2019m not taking any chances with yours or your brother\u2019s noggins.\u201d He looked at me over his shades. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I pulled my helmet on. \u201cBeen.\u201d</p> <p>With a laugh, Luc jumped and kick-started the bike; Phin did the same, and we pulled down the driveway, past two tall palms, and onto the street.</p><p>For several hours after, we rode every street and alley of historic Charleston; from Market Street, to Church Street, past the white exterior of the French Huguenot Church, the unique salmon-colored Unitarian Church in Charleston with its square-topped steeple, up to Marion Square, and then down again. We learned King Street, Queen Street, Meeting Street, the open market, the historic district. The church district lent tall spires that stabbed the sky, and the French district had caf\u00e9s and shops. That was all pretty easy to get the hang of. It reminded me a lot of Savannah, although we had more squares. Still, it was pretty easy to get, and simple to get the feel for. For a couple more hours, we rode; no alley, no side street next to a tourist shop, no restaurant, went unsearched. Late afternoon approached fast.</p><p>Then we rode out a ways, to the industrial part of the city, where the scenery wasn\u2019t so picturesque. Compared to the clean-lined historic district, with its palms and white buildings and pristine parks, this part of the city had an underground, postapocalyptic feel to it. These streets and barred-windowed businesses were purposely kept out of the travel mags and tourist brochures. Everything looked ... dirtier. Rather, forgotten. We pulled up to what appeared to be an old brick warehouse. In faded red letters against a gray metal sign, the words MALLORY\u2019S FISH MARKET stretched in an arch. The moment Luc killed the motor, a single door opened and Noah Miles stepped out.</p><p>He looked dead at me.</p><p>\u201cKnow the city now, do you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, and glanced around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Eli?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cHe left about an hour ago. Had to go make arrangements with Garr, Preacher\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>Luc braced the weight of the bike with his legs, and I stayed on the bike. \u201cSo where\u2019s the fight club?\u201d</p><p>Noah rubbed his jaw and grinned. \u201cNot anxious, are you? Already packin\u2019 silver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to get this over with,\u201d I answered. And dammit, I was.</p><p>He nodded, and the others we\u2019d met at the Dupr\u00e9 House the night before filed out and stood behind Noah. Street tough and ready to fight as they were, one would have a hard time believing they were actually vampires. Jenna, no more than nineteen, was of medium build and had long blond dreads she wore pulled back, similar to Noah\u2019s. Saul was Asian, early twenties, and had zero readable expression on his face. Cafrey and Tate, I\u2019d learned, were brothers from Arkansas, both with buzzed hair with a sturdy, kick-ass build.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Noah said, \u201cscrew the pleasantries, yeah? Welcome to Charles Town. Now, before we get dirty, which only happens after the sun dips, there\u2019s someone we gotta see.\u201d</p><p>Getting dirty meant free running, which I\u2019d later discover, Noah and his guys were totally sick at. But we had a few hours of daylight left, and apparently, someone wanted to see us. \u201cWho?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarr,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for us just a ways out of town.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cEli\u2019s there, too. And not only do you mortals need to eat, but he wants to see da crazy painted white girl Preacher man been talkin\u2019 bout, dat\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, unable to stop the grin from tipping my mouth upward. Noah sort of had that effect on people\u2014on me. He had that cocky, quick-witted, smart-ass attitude that, I don\u2019t know, I thought was pretty funny, I guess. I met his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m starved, so let\u2019s go meet him.\u201d</p><p>I gave my brother a glance; he grinned. Then, Noah and the others disappeared back into the building. Minutes later, one of the garage doors lifted and Noah backed out in a kick-ass blue restored muscle car. I had no idea what it was, but I had to say it was totally Noah.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2019sixty-nine Camaro Z28 RS with hooker headers, four-speed mucie, 373 psi, and four-wheel disc brakes,\u201d Luc offered. He turned and looked at me, the sun glinting off his silver hoop. \u201cIn original Leman\u2019s blue with a black leather interior. Saved it from the junkyard and restored it himself. Pretty sick, huh?\u201d</p><p>Noah pulled the car alongside Luc\u2019s bike and gave me a smile any other woman would have fainted dead over.</p><p>I merely shook my head and grinned.</p><p>\u201cBoys and their toys,\u201d I said. \u201cDead, undead\u2014you\u2019re all the same.\u201d</p><p>Noah flashed his white teeth. \u201cFollow me.\u201d He pulled out, his exhaust rumbling, and we fell in behind him.</p><p>Heading north on Highway 17, we eased out of Charleston following Noah. Approximately twenty-eight miles later, we hit the small town of Awendaw and turned east toward the river. I held on to Luc as we turned down a narrow gravel lane that led back into the wood. The sun was beginning to drop lower in the sky, and shadows fell long and jagged from aged live oaks across the palm fronds and sweetgrass hugging either side of the lane. I knew we grew closer to the river; the pungent smell of sea life clung to the humid air like fog. Up ahead, Noah\u2019s taillights lit up as he pulled in front of a small, older river house; painted green several years before, it had a screened-in porch and a single yard lamp. Luc pulled next to the Camaro and killed the engine. I swung my leg over and off the bike.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Noah said, grinning, suddenly at my side and grasping my elbow. A deep, singsong voice that sounded strikingly familiar broke through the night air.</p><p>\u201cAwe, now, dere she is, den,\u201d a tall, wiry black man said from the top step of the screened-in porch. \u201cYou come on over here, Riley Poe, and bring your brodder; dat\u2019s right. Let me take a look at you two.\u201d</p><p>I threw one more glance at Luc, whose back was to me as he spoke, and for a second I thought to crank up my strigoi hearing and eavesdrop. I didn\u2019t get the chance. Garr, Preacher\u2019s cousin, stopped me. No\u2014I mean literally. He stopped me\u2014with a lot more strength than an old man should have had. I stared at him.</p><p>Garr flashed me a gap-toothed smile.</p><p>Then, it hit me. He had tendencies.</p><p>A little something Preacher had left out.</p><p>As Garr led me up the steps into his river cabin, Noah, Phin, and Seth on my heels, he let out a deep, amused chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWell, baby,\u201d he said, and we stepped into the cabin. \u201cWe got some catchin\u2019 up to do, me and you.\u201d All of six feet five inches, he looked down at me. The ceiling fan whirring in the living room seemed about to take his head off. \u201cNow, we ain\u2019t stoppin\u2019 in here, no, sir.\u201d He inclined his head, adorned with a faded Awendaw Blue Crabs cap, perched slightly crookedly. \u201cStraight out da back door, to da pavilion. Your Eli is waitin\u2019 for you out dere.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cYou like crabs, don you, girl?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYes, sir. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, den. Let\u2019s get out dere before dey all get eaten.\u201d</p><p>Garr left no chance for me to discuss anything with Noah or Phin. He continued to pull me through the little river house, straight out the back door, and down a long wooden dock over the marsh. A slight breeze kicked up and blew briny air across my cheeks, and the rustle of saw grass blades scraping against one another nearly soothed me.</p><p>Nearly, but not quite.</p><p>Once at the end, three other Gullah standing by Eli raised their heads and grinned. Two were older, maybe in their late fifties, and one was younger, midtwenties. The barefoot younger guy, bare-chested and wearing cut-offs to his knees, was dumping a basket of live crabs into a large pot of boiling water. Metal crab baskets lined the dock, and two long metal, green-netted scoop nets rested against a lawn chair in the middle. Two large coolers sat beside them. The boy nodded, keeping his gaze trained on me. Eli walked toward us.</p><p>\u201cCome on in here, girl,\u201d Garr said, and led us into the screened-in boathouse. A long, well-used wooden table and benches took the length of the small house; covered in newspaper, a large pile of boiled crabs, red from cooking, sat heaped in the center.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he said, and crossed in front of me to sit on the other side. \u201cEat.\u201d Old gnarled hands picked up a crab, pulled off the claw, and pulled the pincers apart. He sucked the juice from the claw, then cracked into the meat with a tiny hammer.</p><p>Eli stepped inside and found a seat beside me. Seth slid in next to me, on the other side; Noah and Phin crossed over and sat on the other side, next to Garr. A few minutes later, Luc wandered in and sat next to Seth. We all ate. The young Gullah brought in plastic cups and a cold gallon milk jug filled with sweet tea, then poured our glasses and left.</p><p>\u201cYou see, girl,\u201d Garr started, in between bites of white claw meat, \u201cCharles Town in a bad way, dat\u2019s right. Just like Savannah. Maybe worse,\u201d he said. \u201cDat Preacher, he told me what happened over dere, with da hell stone.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDat\u2019s bad stuff, dem Arcoses. But dem Dupr\u00e9s, dey handled it good, wit your help.\u201d He glanced at Seth. \u201cYou all right, boy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Garr nodded. \u201cWell, we glad to have your help here in Charles Town. Been a long time since we had much trouble here, dat\u2019s right, Noah?\u201d</p><p>Noah gave me a quick glance. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>Garr leaned forward, crab meat sticking to his fingers. \u201cWell, we got it now, doh. Dem Arcoses, dey turned some, dey left some wit tendencies, dey killed some. No tellin\u2019 how many runnin\u2019 round now, doh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher says we have to entomb them again,\u201d Eli offered. \u201cMaybe just one of them.\u201d</p><p>Garr nodded. \u201cProbly so.\u201d Eli had already explained to Garr Victorian\u2019s explanation, and about me. The whole while, Garr said nothing more. But he watched me with ancient, wise eyes.</p><p>We finished eating; I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever eaten so many crabs at once. They were good, with just the right amount of seasoning. Some of it I recognized as normal, regular, everyday spicy crab boil seasoning; some I did not.</p><p>\u201cTo keep up your strength,\u201d Noah said, staring at me from across the table. He wagged his brows.</p> <p>By the time we finished, the sun had nearly set; the gloaming, Noah had called it, with no sun, no moon, and the eerie glow of afterlight. Usually, the gloaming was filled with bugs and birds and frogs, calling, mating, singing\u2014not so much anymore. Funny how nature knew what was going on, but humans didn\u2019t.</p><p>We left the dock, and the afterlight, behind.</p><p>Inside Garr\u2019s river house, he pulled something from the pocket of his white T-shirt and stopped us one more time. He handed a vial each to Seth and me. \u201cDrink up, Brodder and Sister,\u201d he said. \u201cDis will let dem newlin\u2019s tink you mortal all de way. Might help for a spell, dat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Neither Seth nor I hesitated; we unscrewed the small little lid and turned the bottle upright. We drained every drop. It tasted a mixture of sweet and tang, but with no aftertaste. We handed the vials back to Garr.</p><p>\u201cDere now. You go and take care of stuff. I\u2019m here if you need me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I returned, and before I could go, he grasped both of my hands. With aged fingers he trailed the dragons on my arms, scraping the wings at my cheek.</p> <p>\u201cYou mind dem Dupr\u00e9s, girl,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd dis Noah, too. Dey keep you and your brodder safe, and Preachers boys and dat odder big dark fella.\u201d He narrowed his eyes. \u201cDon be a hardhead, girl. You can\u2019t take dem all on by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I answered, and could only wonder what sort of conversations he and Preacher\u2019 had had about me.</p><p>Garr grinned. \u201cWasn\u2019t no Preacher, girl. Was Eli Dupr\u00e9. Now git.\u201d</p><p>I could do nothing more than stare.</p><p>Garr laughed and shooed us out of his little old green river house. Eli grasped my arm and pulled me close.</p><p>As we crossed the yard, the lamplight cast an amber half circle around the house. Beyond the circle, fireflies blinked in the night. It felt surreal here, on the Awendaw; almost disjointed from the hell in Charleston. I knew better, though, and by the time we left and headed south on US 17, complete darkness had fallen. This time, I rode back with Eli on his bike.</p><p>Just as we hit the city limits, I felt Eli\u2019s hand grasp mine, wrapped around his waist, and squeeze. He said nothing. He didn\u2019t have to, and I wasn\u2019t going to ask.</p><p>No sooner had Eli stopped the bike than Victorian\u2019s voice fill my head.</p> <p>Please, Riley\u2014you don\u2019t have to do this. It is a fight you will never win, love. Don\u2019t you see? There\u2019re too many of them, and I cannot stand the thought of your putting yourself in danger. I\u2019m begging you\u2014leave now. Please? And yes\u2014you can answer me in your head. Another strigoi quality. Just think to me... .</p><p>\u201cWhat is it that you can\u2019t stand the thought of? My killing your kind? I\u2019m in constant danger, Victorian. Whether I\u2019m in the fight or not. You know me by now\u2014I will not sit idly by and watch others die. Maybe you can live with that, but I can\u2019t, \u201d I thought.</p><p>\u201cAh, see? Just that easy. You\u2019ll find more abilities as time goes by. And this\u2014it\u2019s one of the many qualities I adore about you, Riley. I so wish I could just take you away. You and I, completely alone somewhere, far away from the melee you\u2019re about to subject yourself to. I dream of nothing, day and night, but you; the smell of your skin, the taste of your lips, the feel of your hands on me. It\u2019s ... almost painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting into that with you right now, Victorian. You know where my heart lies,\u201d I thought to myself.</p><p>\u201cI know where you think your heart lies. I aim to prove otherwise. For now, love, I beg you; listen to those around you. Let them keep you safe. My existence would be no longer if you perish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make promises, other than I will be careful. Now, go away. You\u2019re distracting me.\u201d</p><p>Ah, a promising gesture indeed. Distraction. I have more hope now than before. I shall see you soon, love. Stay safe.</p><p>\u201cRi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, and just that fast, the conversation was over. I focused on Eli\u2019s face. I could tell he couldn\u2019t hear my conversation with Victorian. \u201cI just carried on a conversation with Victorian. In my head,\u201d I said, closing my eyes briefly. I looked at him. Eli\u2019s eyes were harder than usual, but he said nothing. \u201cHe says it\u2019s my strigoi blood that gives me the ability, and no,\u201d I said, meeting his angry gaze, \u201cI don\u2019t want it. But I\u2019m stuck with it. And he was begging me not to fight.\u201d I wasn\u2019t lying\u2014Victorian was a distraction. Eli was a distraction. Anything right now was a distraction. I had to get my mind in the game and erase all other distractions from my thoughts. It was bad enough my little brother ran beside me in all this; I had to do things right the first time and get this shit over with.</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d Eli said. \u201cNo more secrets, Riley.\u201d</p><p>My stomach turned. \u201cNo more secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ready to get dirty?\u201d Noah said, walking from the garage and standing before me in the beam of street light.</p><p>I glanced at Luc, who rolled up and pushed his bike in next to the Camaro.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Noah\u2019s guys appeared from the building; Zetty with them. Phin, Luc, Seth, Eli, and I gathered.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Noah said, and took off running. His team followed.</p><p>\u201cLadies first,\u201d Luc said, but Eli grabbed my arm when I started off. \u201cRiley,\u201d he said. \u201cBe careful. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always am,\u201d I said, and hoped he could detect the sincerity in my gaze. He gave a short nod\u2014meaning he understood\u2014and we took off after the group.</p><p>Jenna, in her baggy jeans, T-back, and black high-tops, could just about outrun Noah. We moved through the city\u2019s industrial section on foot, bounding off rooftops, treetops, cars and awnings; there wasn\u2019t a flat surface we couldn\u2019t use. Zetty, whom I hadn\u2019t done any free-running with, surprised the hell out of me. That big guy could haul ass and jump just as high as Phin. He wasn\u2019t quite as nimble, maybe, and obviously not as experienced; Phin had been doing it a lot longer. Still, he was impressive.</p><p>The brine of the city, mixed with the dirt and trash and urine of downtown industrial Charleston, hung thick in the air, trapped in the same fog of humidity as Savannah. Dark clouds had formed, just before dark, and a slight rumble sounded in the darkened distance. Every once in a while, heat lightning would flash across the sky.</p><p>It brought back heated memories of Eli and me on the barrier island, not too long ago, and he must have remembered, too, because our gazes met frequently and there was always something there, heated, between us. It thrilled me and urged me on.</p><p>As we ran and leapt, my anger, anxiety, fear, propelled me. I pumped my arms, used my thigh muscles to spring from ledges, and moved with all my energy until I burned. It felt good; the weight of my blades, sheathed in moleskin made by my surrogate grandfather, felt more familiar; adrenaline built up. By the time Noah led us to a dilapidated redbrick building in a row of other old buildings in the very slums of Charleston, I barely recognized it as an old church; after I noticed the double wooden archways, I wondered if it\u2019d once been a carriage house. Graffiti in white paint marked the double doors\u2014two large M\u2019s, whatever that meant. Crouched atop the roof across the street, we peered at the row. I could hear the roar inside. With my sense of smell I detected sweat, piss, and the metallic scent of blood. I struggled to keep the exaggerated oscillatory sounds of the city out, and after a few moments of concentration, I filtered out most. I glanced upward. One small oval window, near the top, flickered with light. Noah moved next to me. Eli stood protectively on my other side.</p><p>\u201cNo cops wander this side of town,\u201d he said. \u201cThey skirt it, avoid it, and it\u2019s always been bad, and I don\u2019t mean vampire bad.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cThat\u2019s a new development. I mean street gangs, drugs, whores\u2014you name it. It\u2019s just easier for the cops to let what happens, happen. Not enough room in the prison for all this.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him.</p><p>He pointed up the street. \u201cSee that convenience store?\u201d I looked. \u201cWhatever kind of shit you want, you can get out back next to the Dumpster, right along with a loaf of bread, a bag of Chick-O-Sticks, and a six-pack of beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet place to raise a family,\u201d I offered. \u201cNow, are we headed in or what? I don\u2019t want to be in the middle of a fight when a vision comes over me again. I go totally out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Noah said, his mercury eyes regarding me, then shifting to Eli. \u201cI can always pull you out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will,\u201d Eli said, his voice dark and threatening.</p><p>I narrowed my gaze at them both.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay, Riley Poe. Bro. Chill.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cOnce we\u2019re in, we separate. If any of the newlings notice us all together, they\u2019ll get suspicious and come after us, despite the Gullah potion we all drank. You wanna try and save a few in the quickening, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phin answered. \u201cAs many as possible. Garr\u2019s ready for them, right?\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cYep. They\u2019re waiting at our place. One call and his guys are here to haul them off.\u201d</p><p>Phin nodded. \u201cGood deal.\u201d</p> <p>Noah continued. \u201cAll right. Eli, Luc, stay with Riley. If she goes out, get her out. Josie, I\u2019ll be with you and Seth.\u201d Noah gave my brother a hard look. \u201cAnd don\u2019t zone in on your sister. She\u2019s our concern tonight, not yours. You watch your own neck. We\u2019ll watch hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can use Luc on someone else. I got Riley,\u201d Eli said, moving close.</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cLuc\u2019s for you, man, in case you get out of control.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Eli\u2019s face. It darkened. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d I assured. It didn\u2019t seem to help much.</p><p>Seth threw a glance my way. The wind caught his dark brown hair and tossed it into his eyes. I could tell he hated this, and for a second I wished like hell we could go back, to before the Arcoses were released. I missed his innocence. Love you, he mouthed to me. I mouthed it back, then nodded to Noah. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>Noah gave him a return nod, then turned to the others. \u201cPhin, you\u2019re on Zetty. My guys, scatter. Keep your eyes peeled and stay close\u2014but not too close. We don\u2019t want them knowing we\u2019re all together.\u201d He glanced down at the street and pointed. A group of four guys had turned the corner and were headed to the entrance. \u201cMortals. Perfect. Let\u2019s follow them in. And hey\u2014we\u2019re not here to cause shit tonight. The killings won\u2019t happen until the end of the week, anyway, so keep your head on straight.\u201d He looked at me and smiled. \u201cFollow me, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at Eli, who inclined his head to follow Noah, and I did. Luc stayed behind us. We swung down, bounded, and leapt, until we dropped to the sidewalk. In the distance, a siren blasted over the city, and close by, a baby\u2019s unhappy scream seeped out of an open window and ripped through the night. It gave me chills to think of a baby being raised in this environment. I knew there were thousands more I\u2019d managed to tune out.</p><p>I followed Noah to the front entrance, and we filed in behind the mortals. Inside, the fanatic boom of heavy metal music thumped against the walls, joined by the muffled rumble of hollering, objects being slammed against surfaces, swearing, cheering.</p><p>Screams.</p><p>We found more graffiti inside. The whole place was dim, with a few candles lighting the interior of the shelled-out church, with a fading charred outline of Christ on the cross where it used to hang on the wall, obviously before a fire took it out. Charred rafters overhead and a set of narrow steps leading upward near the back made up the room. We headed to the stairs. The mortals had already started up. Hurrying across the floor littered with cans, trash, liquor bottles and cigarette butts, we followed them up and pushed into a crowded room above. Our group instantly separated. The scent of kerosene burned my nostrils as I followed Luc around a ring of spectators. Inside were two fighters; bare to the waist, wearing ripped jeans, and barefoot. Both were mortal. As I squeezed through the crowd, I glanced around and noticed several guys wearing dark shades.</p><p>\u201cNewlings trying to hide their freaked-out eyes,\u201d Luc offered. \u201cKeep up.\u201d</p> <p>I pushed closer to Luc. \u201cWhy is it mortal against mortal?\u201d I said into his ear.</p><p>He looked at me. \u201cTo weed out the weak,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Just like Noah had said, the newlings were looking for the strongest of the mortals to lure into their band. It made sense.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get in here,\u201d Eli said, and pushed in next to a pair of guys at ringside. Two guys fought, their faces cut and bloodied. I could literally sense the bloodlust accumulating in the room, vying with an immense overload of testosterone. How the newlings were keeping their cool, I had no friggin\u2019 clue.</p><p>\u201cWhoever created them is controlling them\u2014that\u2019s how,\u201d Eli said against my ear. \u201cWith one thought he could tell them to maul and devour everyone in this room. That\u2019s why I want you to watch your mouth, your ass, and not to do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him hard. \u201cYeah, I got that, Dupr\u00e9. Stop worrying so much.\u201d The guy next to me jumped, and I fell hard into Eli\u2019s side. \u201cDoes that mean he\u2019s here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Luc pushed beside me and shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>The crowd cheered as one of the fighters roundhouse kicked the other in the face and knocked him down. One of the newlings, dressed in dark jeans, a dark tee, and a black skully with dark shades, walked the perimeter of the man-made ring, watching everything\u2014including what went on in the crowd. Across the way, I noticed Noah and Seth. My stomach lurched at the thought of watching my brother fight. He normally wasn\u2019t a fighter. He was sweet, and he had a kind, cheerful soul.</p> <p>\u201cNow he has a kick-ass soul,\u201d Luc offered. \u201cPay attention, Riley. Head in the game.\u201d</p><p>I swore in Romanian. Eli pressed against me, probably to make sure I knew he wasn\u2019t going to put up with my being pig-headed, and continued to watch the fight.</p><p>The guy beating the holy crap out of the other thought he was one tough bastard. Even when the other guy was on the floor, he stomped and kicked him in the ribs. The more the crowd cheered, the more brutal he became. We watched him fight one more guy, nearly beating him to death, before I could take no more. The weaker one kept trying to get up, would make it on one knee, and the other would smash into his face with his elbow, then his heel. I pushed the guy in front of me, heard Eli swear as I rushed the floor, and I knew Luc had restrained him, because he didn\u2019t follow. Just as big bully badass was about to drop his half-dead opponent, I roundhouse kicked him in the ribs. I heard Eli behind me say, \u201cFuck!\u201d just as my new opponent dropped to one knee.</p><p>The crowd roared.</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I noticed the newling moderator move toward me. I challenged him. \u201cWhat?\u201d I threw my hands up. \u201cYou got a fuckin\u2019 rule says I can\u2019t fight him?\u201d</p><p>A slow smile spread across his face. I couldn\u2019t see his eyes, but I knew they were weird and opaque behind his shades. His skin was pale\u2014almost a blue hue. Funny how no one else seemed to notice. His gaze raked over my inked skin. \u201cThere are no rules, bitch. Go for it.\u201d</p><p>The moment he said it, the crowd roared, and my opponent, jumping up, lunged toward me. I dodged and swept a leg out. He tripped and hit the floor.</p><p>I really, really didn\u2019t want to fight a mortal.</p><p>I didn\u2019t dare look behind me, back into the crowd. Eli\u2019s anger hit me like a wave, and I could only imagine Luc was having a helluva time restraining him.</p><p>It was like fighting a toddler\u2014unfair; no sport\u2014and it wasn\u2019t accomplishing anything. I wanted to kill vampires. I wanted to kill him, the monster.</p><p>I let my opponent land a few hits, just for show. They hurt. I dealt. I made sure no blood was spilled.</p><p>Unavoidably, my gaze hit the crowd. Twice I found Eli glaring at me. Luc grinned. I\u2019d caught Noah\u2019s stare as well, but his was a slight smile instead. He was diggin\u2019 it, I could tell\u2014freakazoid.</p><p>His smile broke wider, and I shook my head.</p><p>Finally, I grew tired of playing around with the mortal dude. I\u2019d made my point\u2014to the crowd and to the newlings. With an elbow to the gut, and a double fist to the nose, I sent him to la-la land. The crowd roared. I feigned slight exhaustion, grabbed my knees, and breathed. I lifted my head slightly; Luc\u2019s expression had softened. Eli\u2019s had not. But a slight nod assured me to keep going.</p><p>Next, I fought a girl: early twenties, solid as stone, mean as shit, and high as a friggin\u2019 kite\u2014high, but not wasted. She was totally pissed at me for some odd reason, and once we got the go-ahead nod from the newling ref, she threw herself at me like some crazed banshee, squalling and screeching. She scared the holy hell out of me.</p><p>\u201cCome on, whore,\u201d she said, dancing around me and taking pokes with her balled-up fists. I didn\u2019t even flinch, her marks were that off. \u201cYou scared or somethin\u2019? What\u2019cha waitin\u2019 for, huh, bitch?\u201d</p><p>Bap. I took her down, just on principle. One punch and she was out cold. I still hadn\u2019t broken a sweat. Again, the crowd cheered.</p><p>Somebody dragged her off the floor.</p><p>I noticed two newlings standing together; something I hadn\u2019t seen all night. They were talking, and once I honed in on them, I realized they were talking about me. I wasn\u2019t exactly sure if that was a bad thing or not.</p><p>I fought two more guys before I noticed Eli in the sidelines waving me out. After I took the last one out, I once again pretended exhaustion, and I staggered from the fight floor. It was covered in blood, spit, and something else I dared not to try and identify. Disgusting. At least it wasn\u2019t my blood\u2014or any other body fluid.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the one newling who\u2019d been watching me closely for the past two hours said, grabbing my arm. \u201cYou wanna come back Friday night?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You got somethin\u2019 more than a bunch of pussies and druggies for me to fight?\u201d</p><p>I heard Eli hiss behind me.</p><p>A slow smile spread across his pale face, and I noticed his brows were so blond, they blended in with his undead skin. The black skully he wore stood in stark contrast to his pastiness. Some would be scared. I wanted to beat his arrogant ass. And it suddenly struck me how well the potion Garr gave the guys\u2014the vampire guys\u2014worked. They paid them no attention. Cool. \u201cYeah. Come back Friday night and find out.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a hard glare and knocked his shoulder with mine as I passed. He smiled, knowing I\u2019d be back, and I bet he was looking to try and whip me himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked Eli. \u201cYou here to watch your woman fight? You a pussy or somethin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>The air around us stilled. \u201cWhat you got for me?\u201d Eli said, his voice deadly.</p><p>The newling\u2019s mouth lifted at the corner, and he inclined his head to the ring. \u201cCome on and find out.\u201d</p><p>Eli didn\u2019t even spare me a glance. He followed the newling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the ring, the newling nodded at another, and in seconds, a big, heavily muscled guy in his midtwenties stepped up. He had to be all of six feet seven\u2014taller than Eli. I could tell he was on something. Eli shrugged out of his shirt and stepped into the ring. The big mortal came at him like a truck.</p><p>Eli gave a good show. He toned his strength way down and let the guy get in several good punches. I watched in fascination the movement of muscles across Eli\u2019s back, his biceps, and the raw power he managed to restrain as he fought. Finally, he popped the guy in the jaw and the mortal hit the floor, out cold. Eli spit on the floor beside him and stepped out of the ring. The newling moved, said something to him, and Eli made his way back to me.</p><p>His firm grasp on my arm was almost painful. Eli\u2019s mouth pushed to my ear. \u201cLet\u2019s get the fuck out of here before you do something else stupid and get pulled back into the ring.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced over my shoulder as we moved through the crowd. I limped for good measure. \u201cYeah? It seemed like the right thing to do, Dupr\u00e9. That first guy was gonna kill that kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think\u2019s been happening all along? What\u2019s going to happen tonight? We can\u2019t stay and babysit them all.\u201d</p><p>I rounded on him the moment the crowd thinned. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to fight mortals. I thought we were here to take care of a bloodsucking problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fightin\u2019 again, Bro?\u201d Luc asked.</p><p>Eli nodded. \u201cYeah. So it seems. Luc\u2019s head lifted, and he gave a short nod. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re meeting the others outside, rooftop.\u201d</p> <p>I felt the newlings\u2019 eyes on me the whole way out.</p><p>Luc, Eli, and I were first out the door, so we free-ran to the rooftop across the street and down a ways, and waited for the others.</p><p>I paced.</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we just round up all the newlings inside? Trap them in? Gather the ones in the quickening phase, destroy the newlings, and take the freaking hell off?\u201d</p><p>Luc shook his head. \u201cRiley, Riley, Riley. No patience, huh? Just like before, there are reasons you can\u2019t just rush in and do.\u201d He tapped my temple. \u201cThink, smartypants. Remember how the Arcoses could control the boys from before with a single thought? Well, whoever is controlling this band\u2014Valerian reborn\u2014can do the same thing. He gets one whiff of interference and things could turn really, really ugly. They outnumber us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re mixed in a building filled with mortals,\u201d Noah said, leaping up beside us. The others joined him. He grinned at me. \u201cNo matter how much of a dick some of them are.\u201d He punched my arm. \u201cCrack shootin\u2019, Poe. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p> <p>Eli glowered and moved closer.</p><p>Seth interrupted, angry. \u201cRiley, you didn\u2019t have to jump in like that.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my brother. Worry etched his green eyes, and the muscles in his jaws clenched, dark brows slashed into a frown. \u201cI could\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, and hugged him. \u201cYou know I\u2019m unpredictable. I couldn\u2019t stand seeing that one guy log into the other one. He\u2019d have killed him. It was instinct, not a plan. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Seth pulled back and met my gaze. The wind caught and pushed his hair to the side. \u201cYou gonna do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut you are all going to be there to back me up. I have the newlings\u2019 attention. We\u2019re getting somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Seth frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, Ri. But okay.\u201d</p><p>Noah walked over and draped his arms over each of us. \u201cYou two are just so darn cute,\u201d he said, mercury eyes twinkling. He glanced at Eli. \u201cBut let\u2019s go. That is, if you want to save a few souls.\u201d</p> <p>Seth threw me a whatever glance. I couldn\u2019t help but grin at Noah\u2019s ridiculousness, and we followed him and his roof jumpers over the ancient city of Charleston. Eli ran close to me\u2014so close I could feel the air he moved.</p><p>One major difference between vampires and mortals with tendencies I\u2019d like to quickly point out is mortals have to pee. \u201cGuys, no way can I leap from one more rooftop with a full bladder,\u201d I said as we stopped to inspect the area. I glanced down. \u201cThere\u2019s a Denny\u2019s. Open twenty-four hours. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I turned to descend.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Eli said. \u201cWait up.\u201d</p><p>I quickly stopped. \u201cOh come on, Eli. Gimme a friggin\u2019 break. It\u2019s right down there.\u201d I bent down, rested the heels of my palms on my knees, and peered down and into the restaurant. I pointed. \u201cLook. You can see the bathrooms from here. Straight in the back.\u201d I rose and glared at Luc. \u201cI pee alone. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Eli said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right outside the bathroom door. Waiting. While you pee alone.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cWhatever. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, as I praised God I did regular Kegels, we descended the building, leapt against the trunk of a magnolia, and fell to the sidewalk in a crouch. I glanced around and ran across the street and into Denny\u2019s. Eli ran beside me.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, this isn\u2019t a public restroom,\u201d an older waitress said.</p><p>I hurried past her. \u201cHoney, will you order me a burger to go? Rare,\u201d I said to Eli. He growled. Seriously\u2014what was she gonna do? Drag me off the toilet? I all but skipped to the back and pushed into the women\u2019s restroom while Eli stayed behind to deal with Mrs. Denny\u2019s. I hit the end stall, made fast but careful business of taking care of business (eleven blades strapped to my body, don\u2019t forget) and, relieved, finished. Flushing the toilet with my foot, I moved out of the stall and to the sink to wash my hands. I splashed water on my face, rubbed my eyes, and when I opened them, she stood behind me\u2014a girl, dressed in black destroyed jeans, clunky black biker boots, a black and red ribbed tank with spiked studs along the collar and arms, and a headful of black dreads. Gaze fixed, she stared at me through the mirror, unblinking, at the pulse near the base of my throat. She licked her lips.</p><p>I knew then what she was.</p><p>In the next second her face contorted, her jaw unhinged unnaturally, and jagged fangs dropped. Her eyes went white, the pupils pinpoint red, and she lunged.</p><p>Part Eight</p><p>MELEE</p><p>\u201cYou know that person you said there\u2019s no such person? I think he\u2019s in there. In person.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Lou Costello, Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein</p><p>\u201cOh my freaking God, when will this end? I\u2019m tired, my body aches, my language has gotten worse, and I\u2019m dying for a smoke. Charleston is crawling with the undead, and they\u2019re mean little fresh fuckers trying to earn their place in the vampiric world by hunting down me\u2014and others like me. Hello?! No, thank you! I\u2019m ready to rock and roll, do the hokie pokie, do a little dance, make a little love, and get down tonight. In other words, wrap this shit up and take a goddamn vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d I barely shouted. Then I ducked, lunged, pushed with my feet, and bounded off the sink, then the wall, and landed across the bathroom in a low crouch.</p><p>The she-vamp crashed into the mirror. Glass shards fell into the porcelain sink.</p><p>It didn\u2019t make her very happy.</p><p>A strangled, pissed-off, inhuman sound emerged from her throat, and she lunged at me again\u2014damn, she was fast\u2014with fangs long and face weirdly distorted, some gross juicy stuff dripping from the corner of her mouth, her dreads flying all over like so many Medusa snakes; she wanted me and wanted me bad. I wasn\u2019t wasting any time with her. I ducked and dodged again, bounded off the far wall, ran the length of all five sinks, broke a few faucets; reached down the back of my pants, drew my blade, and, the moment I landed, turned, aimed, and released.</p><p>The look of shock as my silver buried to the hilt in her heart was picture-worthy.</p><p>Dropping to the floor as though every bone in her body had melted, she immediately began to convulse.</p><p>The bathroom door flung open and crashed against the wall. Eli stood there. Luc and Noah ran up behind him, staring. Luc\u2019s face showed concern. Noah, well, he was smiling, as usual. Eli looked pissed.</p><p>\u201cSick, sick!\u201d Noah said, like a proud daddy. \u201cYou just nailed your first Charles Town bloodsucker, babe.\u201d He slapped my shoulder. \u201cSweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley, what the hell?\u201d Eli said, as if something were my fault. I had to freaking pee! That was it! He read my thoughts, and his gaze softened a little.</p><p>\u201cSir, excuse me,\u201d the waitress from out front said behind the door. She was trying to look over Luc\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in there?\u201d</p><p>Luc turned and backed out. \u201cOh, my sister, ma\u2019am. She\u2019s sick. Threw up all over the floor. Flu, I think. You gotta mop? I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d I heard her say. \u201cYou\u2019ll clean that up, right?\u201d</p><p>Luc glanced at me over his shoulder. \u201cSure, no problem.\u201d</p><p>I watched yet another vamp turn to dust, this time right in the freaking Denny\u2019s women\u2019s restroom. What a way to go.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Eli said, grasping my elbow. He did a lot of that lately, and I couldn\u2019t decide if it was endearing or annoying.</p><p>\u201cI need to clean it up,\u201d I said.</p><p>Luc cleaned up the mess; he literally swept the dust into a ziplock and pocketed it. Then we left.</p><p>\u201cEver see her before?\u201d Luc asked Noah, behind us.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe was a totally random rogue; I didn\u2019t recognize her, and apparently she\u2019d been lying in wait in the bathroom for her next victim.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cBet she wasn\u2019t expecting a vampire slayer strapped with pure silver to have to pee.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cVampire slayer with tendencies, dude.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m just glad she at least let me finish peeing first.\u201d</p><p>Back on the rooftop across from Denny\u2019s, Seth paced. The moment I swung up, he rushed at me. \u201cRi! What\u2019s freaking wrong with you?\u201d he said, anger burning in his eyes. \u201cWhy do you have to keep doing that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhoa, whoa,\u201d I said, gently. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. Had to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>He shoved his hand in his hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t seem to do much of anything anymore, without getting into trouble. Next time take Josie. Into the restroom. Please?\u201d</p><p>I hugged my brother. \u201cOkay. Promise.\u201d I glanced at Josie. She simply shrugged and grinned. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>We ran into the city and hit a club called Meter 59, a hole-in-the-wall punk club just on the edge of the historic district. We filed in, and the music, the lights, thumped through my body. The place was packed with more black leather, black lace, spiked hair and severe piercings than I\u2019d seen in years. This was a rough bunch. We spread out. Eli, of course, stayed on my tail.</p><p>Eli grabbed me by the hips and pushed me into the crowd of dancers; we moved to the music. His hooded gaze locked on mine, and I almost forgot we were there to scout newlings, or those in their quickening. We brushed, not touching but seductively close, and as he turned me, his hand trailing down my back to my ass, I spotted them\u2014three in all; two guys, one girl.</p><p>\u201cI see them,\u201d Eli said, his mouth brushing my ear, making me shiver and making it hard to concentrate. His hands skimmed my ribs. \u201cI\u2019ve told the others. They\u2019re looking for more. We\u2019ll keep our eyes on these three.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and, keeping with the blasting tunes of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, I moved my backside against Eli\u2019s front. To others we looked like a normal, average horny couple dancing and enjoying the music. Well ... we were all that. But we also had our sites locked on almostvampires. I knew from experience they were mean little fuckers. They wouldn\u2019t be easy to take down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy,\u201d he said against my ear. His hand settled seductively over my stomach, then slipped lower over my hip. \u201cJesus, Ri.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at that. My insides quivered. I wanted him. And from the hardness pressing against my back, he wanted me, too.</p><p>A low growl rumbled in Eli\u2019s chest.</p><p>Then, the three started to move to the back. They had two mortals with them. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said, and began to weave through the crowd.</p><p>We followed them through the dancers, to the back exit. They\u2019d already managed to get out into the alley by the time we hit the door. The moment I stepped out, the scent of old trash, urine, and brine mixed in my senses. I could have easily barfed, it was so pungent. One of the guys had a knife and was ready to use it on the kid they\u2019d convinced to follow them. The three almost-newlings looked up. The biggest one glared at me.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck outta here,\u201d he warned.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>Eli lunged before I did as all three came at me. The girl skirted Eli, hit the ground, rolled, and shot up running. Crazed and out of control, I braced myself for her. Summoning all of my strength, I clotheslined her as she lunged. She snapped back and hit the concrete flat on her back. She leapt right back up in one motion, teeth gnashing and gnarling. I didn\u2019t have time to see what Eli was doing. The one I had was a handful.</p><p>We fought. She was strong as hell, but I swept her legs out from under her and she fell again. This time, I pinned her throat with my foot, retrieved one of my blades, and held it to her face. \u201cChill,\u201d I instructed.</p><p>Opaque eyes stared crazed up at me. She didn\u2019t move. I glanced over at Eli. His face had contorted. Both almost-newlings were out cold.</p><p>Noah and Phin burst out of the exit door and ran to us. \u201cI\u2019ve already called Garr\u2019s guys,\u201d Noah said. They\u2019re on their way.\u201d</p><p>Eli, his face returned to normal\u2014well, at least my normal\u2014locked his gaze on mine. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at the girl, whose face looked murderous, inhuman. I pressed my foot a little harder into her throat. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>By the time the ruckus finally wrapped up, it was close to four a.m. Garr\u2019s guys came to collect the three, and we ran the roofs till nearly dawn before heading back to the battery. We encountered no further rogue vampires, no further newlings or those in the quickening, and although I wanted them off the streets, I was glad. Exhaustion began its descent, and I wanted nothing more than to crash. We said good-bye to Noah and his group, split, and headed to Jake\u2019s.</p><p>Inside, my brother grabbed my arm. \u201cAre you okay, Ri? Seriously?\u201d Seth asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, squirt. I\u2019m cool. Just tired. See ya in a bit, huh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not tired yet, so I\u2019ll hang with Josie down here. Call me if you need me, though.\u201d He glanced at Eli, who stood directly behind me. \u201cTake care of my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Eli said gently. \u201cI got her.\u201d</p><p>I gave my sweet brother a smile and trudged up the stairs, Eli\u2019s hand resting possessively against the small of my back the whole way up. With each step I wondered how in hell I\u2019d made it through the night, jumping from buildings like a freaking monkey, fight after fight. Adrenaline had obviously kept me going. Well, that had worn off now, and I felt like Indiana Jones after one of his big fights. I hurt everywhere. Now that the action was over, I felt like a wet noodle. I needed a shower, then rest. I made it to my room and pushed inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Eli said. \u201cI need a word with my brothers. For just a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I answered, my tongue feeling heavy in my mouth. Eli left out, and I scanned my room\u2014Jake\u2019s room.</p><p>Lamplight from the riverfront streamed in through my balcony door, casting a narrow beam across the floor. I eased to the bench at the foot of the bed and sat down softly, pushed my Vans off with each opposite foot, peeled my socks off, and just ... sat for a second. Every muscle, every joint, even my skin ached. Slowly, I shrugged out of my tank, stood and peeled off my jeans, and dropped them on the floor. With my blades still sheathed to my various body parts, and in only my bra and panties, I hobbled to the balcony door, opened it, and stepped out onto the veranda. A slight breeze lifted my ponytail, and I reached up, pulled off the elastic band holding it together, and let my hair down. Overhead, thunder boomed; a few seconds later, a streak of lightning lit the sky. Red blinking lights flashed in the harbor as shrimp boats and fishing boats headed out to sea. As the briny breeze caught the palm fronds, they crackled, rubbing against one another. I let the sounds and smells and sights of normalcy wash over me. I leaned against the veranda\u2019s railing and closed my eyes. I stood there for a while; how long, I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cRiley.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flashed open, and my heart leapt at the voice. A dream. Of Eli. In my head. I\u2019d fallen asleep standing up on the veranda.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eli said against my ear with a soft laugh. \u201cNot a dream.\u201d</p><p>Gently, with both hands, Eli grasped my face and tilted my head up. He looked down at me, his eyes searching mine. The lamplight gleamed in their blue depths, and a small smile tipped his sexy mouth. \u201cI missed you, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d I said as he pressed closer. \u201cEasy, easy. Not so hard.\u201d My body ached everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gentle,\u201d he whispered against my lips.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said, flinching. Even my damn lips hurt. I wanted him inside me. I wanted to taste his skin. I wanted him to kiss me. But I freaking hurt.</p><p>Eli\u2019s gaze searched mine. He kissed me gently; yet I felt the power he used to restrain himself. He pulled back, searching my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll stop if you hurt too much.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, puzzled. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>In his eyes shined possession, fierce longing, and something way deeper I had no desire to dwell on at the moment. \u201cCome in here,\u201d he said, grasping my hand and pulling me into the room. I followed.</p><p>Inside, he stood me next to the long antique dresser facing one wall. \u201cStand still.\u201d</p><p>I did as he asked.</p><p>Slowly, and one by one, Eli\u2019s deft fingers moved over my skin to the blades I had sheathed against my body. Loosening each one, he removed them and set them on the dresser. My eyes closed as his fingers trailed down each hip, unclasped the sheath, moved to the next ones, lower on my thighs, then on my shins. When they were all removed, he stood there, simply staring. He grasped my hand. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Leading me across the floor, my gasped breath hitching with each step as the pain in my body shot through me, Eli drew me into the massive bathroom. A large, walk-in tiled shower with multiple water jets faced one wall; a claw-footed bathtub faced the other. Eli walked to the shower, turned on the jets, adjusted the water temperature, then dimmed the lights. When he returned to me, he stood there, staring down, his eyes devouring me. I felt it; I craved it. I craved him.</p><p>A small smile lifted his mouth at the corner. \u201cI love how unshy you are.\u201d</p><p>Steam quickly filled the room; Eli grasped his shirt at the hem and yanked it over his head. In fascination I watched the muscles pull and grow taut with movement. His eyes never left mine. In less than five seconds he had his jeans and boots off and shoved against the wall. My vampire stood there, looking at me with wild hunger and desire in his eyes and not wearing a stitch of clothing.</p><p>My body involuntarily shook.</p><p>He came to me, then; close, his body brushed mine. His fingers eased over my shoulders, across my collarbone, down the front where my bra clasped between my breasts. He released it, eased the straps down, and, as I held my arms straight, I winced. With a gentleness that no longer surprised me, he pushed the silky material off my body and dropped it to the floor.</p><p>Inside, I was dying; outside, my body raged with pain.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby,\u201d he said, slipping his fingers through the waistband of my panties and easing them to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m going to fix that.\u201d</p><p>My heart leapt.</p><p>Slowly, Eli grasped my shoulders and walked me into the shower. Although it was equipped with pulsating, massaging jets, he\u2019d adjusted the water stream to a soft, soothing, and very, very hot waterfall. Guiding me beneath it, he followed. \u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he whispered. I did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With gentle fingers, Eli tilted my head back, and soothing hot water glided over my head and my face; it soaked my hair and drenched my body. His hands smoothed my wet hair back; his fingers traced my nose, my jaw, the column of my throat. Already, the tension in my body began to seep out.</p><p>An aroma of jasmine and verbena filled the air; I realized quickly it was the shampoo that filled Eli\u2019s palms. Gently, he lathered my hair; blunt, strong fingers dug into my scalp, massaged it, and I thought I\u2019d fall asleep standing there.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cStay with me, Riley.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>His seductive mouth against my wet skin made my nerves leap. \u201cTry harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRinse.\u201d He pushed me beneath the cascade of water and rinsed my hair. Next, the air filled with the same aroma as he lathered his hands. \u201cNow be still. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Then, he lathered my body.</p><p>I stood and allowed it for a little while.</p> <p>Eli\u2019s hands, slick with water and soap, glided over my shoulders, down my arms, intertwined his fingers with mine, and drew me close. His wet body pressed close to me, his lips sought the top of my shoulder, my throat, my ear, jaw, and slid to my mouth. In a slow, erotic kiss, his tongue grazed mine, his teeth scraped my lips, captured the bottom one, suckled gently.</p><p>Inside, I grew heavy with desire; my knees weakened, and I lifted my arms to his chest, trailed the muscles there; his breath caught in his throat; he captured my hands in his hands and lowered them.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, Riley,\u201d he said, his voice strained, his accent more prominent, his breath brushing against my ear. \u201cYou touch me, I\u2019ll explode. Just ... be still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t kiss me like that,\u201d I said.</p><p>I felt his smile against my skin. \u201cNo promises there.\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p> <p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he said against my cheek.</p><p>I did, and he pushed my hair over one shoulder and lathered my back, his fingers kneading deep into the sore muscles. I gasped with pleasure and pain, and it took every ounce of strength I had to remain upright. It took even more not to touch Eli.</p><p>There was a wet, sexy, naked vampire in the shower with me.</p><p>Eli\u2019s low chuckle as he read my thoughts resonated against the tile, and his fingers continued to work magic. For now, I didn\u2019t think of carnage, vampiric attacks, monsters, or fight clubs; I thought of nothing but Eli, his touch, and the craving he stirred within me. His hands glided over my body, every inch passed made my eyes roll back in bliss; I wanted him everywhere, inside, out, and I never, ever wanted him to leave me again.</p><p>His hands moved over my hips, encircled my stomach, and pulled my body against his. I felt his muscles pressing into my spine; his hardness pressing against the small of my back. His arms tightened around me, his mouth at my jaw. \u201cI swear, I\u2019ll never leave you again,\u201d he whispered, his voice strained, somewhat painful.</p><p>I turned in his arms, and together we stepped out of the mainstream waterfall; steam rose all around us, and I locked my gaze on his. His dark, wet hair fell across his eyes, and I reached up and pushed it aside; I grazed his jaw and ran my thumb over his sexy lips. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t ever again, Eli.\u201d</p><p>His mouth sought mine. \u201cI promise,\u201d he whispered, his tongue tasting mine.</p><p>I pushed him back. \u201cNow you be still.\u201d</p> <p>A small smile tilted his mouth. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I gathered a handful of liquid soap. \u201cSorry.\u201d I ran my hands over his chest, his shoulders, down his arms, over his stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna smell like a girl.\u201d</p><p>He ducked his head and captured my mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said, in between sensual kisses and nips. I lost myself in his drugging kiss; my hands glided over the muscles in his back, over his tight ass, his hips. The feel of his tongue against mine, his teeth scraping my lips, made me hot, wet, crazy. Blind with need, the pain of my battered body forgotten, I moved my soap-slickened hands over the cut ridges of his abdomen, lower, and grasped his slick hardness. He gasped in my mouth, groaned, kissed me deeper.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Riley,\u201d he said, pained. \u201cControl\u2019s slipping.\u201d He pushed me against the tiled wall, his hands roaming all over me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d I muttered against his throat, my hands stroking him. \u201cNeed you,\u201d I panted, pressing my body to his. \u201cNow, Eli.\u201d</p><p>Without words, he lifted me; as I wrapped my legs around his hips, I slid over his hard length until Eli filled me completely. My head dropped back, drugged, weightless. Beneath the waterfall, Eli\u2019s mouth tasted my skin, his tongue teased the hardened, sensitive peaks of my breasts; first one, then the other. With his fingers digging into my hips, he moved me effortlessly, the feel of his hardness sliding inside me making me crazy high. His mouth caressed me as his cock moved within me.</p><p>\u201cEli,\u201d I gasped, and held on, our rhythm matching, and somewhere deep within me, an intense orgasm began like a faraway storm. We moved beneath the steaming water, fast, out of control, until the storm grew in strength and finally crashed. Wave after wave of climax claimed us both. I lost my breath, and spasms wracked my body. Eli held me close, his mouth pressed to my throat. The world tilted still; Eli\u2019s lovemaking had that effect on me. I could do nothing more than hold on to him. I knew if he wasn\u2019t holding on to me so tightly, I\u2019d slip to the tiles below.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never let that happen,\u201d he whispered against me.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I answered, and ran my fingers through his soft, slick hair, tracing the shell of his ear.</p><p>Without words, Eli reached down with one hand and turned off the waterfall. Through the steam, his eyes searched mine. Slowly, he lowered his head, captured my mouth, and kissed me. Now, his control had returned, and he used it to savor my lips and my tongue, speaking to me with just his mouth; they were actions that spoke volumes over any words he could have whispered.</p><p>Still wet from the shower, and with me still clinging to him, Eli walked to the bed and followed me down into the softness of the down comforter. We shifted, and he pulled me close against him, my head resting on his chest, his arm completely around me and holding me to his body. He pulled back, just enough so that I could see his face without it being blurry.</p><p>Serious, cerulean eyes bore into mine. \u201cI love you, Riley Poe.\u201d He brushed a thumb over my lips. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that.\u201d He kissed me, slowly, erotically, then looked at me again. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to tell Eli how I felt, but his fingers over my lips stopped me.</p><p>\u201cNo, Riley,\u201d he said gently. \u201cAnother time. When you\u2019re really ready.\u201d</p><p>Before I could respond, he pulled me against him again; resting his chin on top of my head. \u201cGo to sleep, mostly mortal woman. We have a busy few days ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Prick, I said in my head.</p><p>Eli laughed, squeezing me a little tighter, and I closed my eyes, smiling.</p><p>Finally, I fought the exhaustion no more. I was content. I mean, how could I not be? Eli was naked. I was naked. We\u2019d just had mind-blowing, soul-searching sex. The only thing better right now would be ... I don\u2019t know. Some corn dogs, maybe. Or a bag from Krystal.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019ve become such a hog,\u201d Eli said, shaking with laughter. \u201cGo to sleep, girl. I\u2019ll get you food after you\u2019ve rested.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOkay.\u201d I snuggled against him. His body temperature was perfect\u2014not too warm, and definitely not too cool.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>Just before sleep claimed me, I felt relief that the monster hadn\u2019t killed again; it was nearly daybreak, anyway.</p><p>How very wrong I was.</p><p>I experienced two kills, back-to-back. It was almost too much for me to handle.</p><p>I\u2019d just felt that wave of exhaustion and contentedness wash over me.</p><p>I found myself walking along the city market. In the harbor, a tugboat blasted its horn, but I paid little attention and continued up the walk. Most of the stores hadn\u2019t opened yet, but in the French Quarter a little caf\u00e9 opened its doors to early risers; they weren\u2019t about yet, but I slipped along the wall, to the back entrance of Fran\u00e7ois Patisserie. Silently, I eased inside. The scent of freshbaked bread and pastries filled the caf\u00e9, but that wasn\u2019t what made my stomach ache with need. In the back, near the double ovens and beside a long stainless steel counter, stood a plump, middle-aged woman, pulling a fresh batch of croissants from the oven. She had no idea I was in the kitchen with her. Rising on pudgy tiptoes, she reached for the top shelf over the sink, grasped a plate, then slid a hot croissant onto it. She smiled, moved to the counter, and removed the lid from a ceramic butter tray. With a knife she buttered her already-buttery croissant and took a big bite. She groaned with pleasure.</p><p>A feeling of impatience came over me, and I knew it was his feeling, not mine. I did the usual\u2014scream, holler, but nothing came out, nothing worked, and I could not warn the plump baker that her death was coming.</p><p>No sooner had the baker woman swallowed her bite of croissant than I moved directly behind her. She must have sensed a presence, for slowly, she turned.</p><p>Her scream died in her throat.</p><p>The monster wasted no time. He lunged, held his hand over the woman\u2019s mouth, and ripped right through her white cotton blouse. He sank his fangs into the flesh of her chest before finding the pulse of her heart. As he pierced the pumping organ, her warm blood gushed into his mouth and slid down his throat; fast at first, then slower, slower until her life force was no more. He dropped her on the floor, wiped his mouth with a rag left on the counter, and left.</p><p>The moment he stepped outside and noticed the jogger heading toward the river, I knew he\u2019d kill again. I don\u2019t know how, but I did. I thrashed, bile rising in my throat at the memory of the poor woman in the bakery, her blouse doused with blood, her dead face contorted in shock and terror.</p><p>Thankfully, the next kill was swift. The shirtless man jogging along the river was young, extremely fit, his chest cut with muscle, a six-pack to die for. He wore a Gamecocks ball cap as he ran, his iPod jamming in his ears. The moment he turned off the river and down an alley to cut through to another street, the monster was there. He stepped out, bumping into the man. The jogger stumbled, his blue eyes shocked to see someone else along his path. The monster waited for nothing. He changed; I knew this because of the horror on the jogger\u2019s face. The monster ripped into him just as he\u2019d ripped into the baker woman, nearly snatching the man\u2019s heart out with his fangs. But the moment the hot metallic fluid pumped into him, he relaxed; he drank fully, and, when he was finished, he threw the jogger against the brick wall and walked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The last thing I remember before waking and separating from the monster, was his laugh.</p><p>It was oddly familiar... .</p><p>I bolted up in bed, my surroundings unfamiliar for a split second. Only then did I notice Eli was gone. I looked around, noticing how dim it still was outside. Eli must have slipped out the moment I\u2019d drifted off. The exhaustion I felt was too real, too thick, and no way could I get out of bed right now. I must have closed my eyes at the exact moment the monster decided to feed; unless he knew me and was torturing me on purpose. If Eli was right, and Valerian, despite how Eli and his brothers had destroyed him, had manifested himself into one of his newlings, then he was the monster. He did know me. And I was pretty fucking sure he wanted to torment me to the fullest. He was succeeding.</p> <p>There was nothing else I could do; no one I could save. I needed sleep. As selfish as it sounds, I lay back down, pulled the sheet up to my chest, and closed my eyes, allowing slumber to take me. Hopefully, Eli would return and pull me into his arms. I slept so much better with him wrapped around me. My eyes grew heavy; Sleep claimed me again.</p><p>I slept for some time; I don\u2019t know how long.</p><p>When I woke, I emerged in yet another dream state. I was sitting in the dark. A dark room, a closet; I was on the floor, my back against ... something. I felt a presence, though; someone was with me. Immediately, I knew who.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d I asked angrily.</p><p>Victorian\u2019s low, sexy soft laugh filled the dark empty space. \u201cWhy? Have you missed me?\u201d</p> <p>I thought about it. \u201cYes. And no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, tell me why yes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no freaking idea, other than you\u2019re my connection to why I behave and feel the way I do, since it\u2019s your DNA clinging to mine. Yours and Valerian\u2019s. And I sort of like you. When you\u2019re not being so pervy. And I\u2019m glad Eli didn\u2019t kill you.\u201d His soft sigh filled the shadowy space we occupied together. \u201cAnd that pleases you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t exactly want you dead,\u201d I said. \u201cNot sure why, but somehow ... it doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want,\u201d I said. \u201cBut believe me, I\u2019m the only one who feels that way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo doubt. And why not?\u201d he continued.</p><p>His presence seemed closer; I can\u2019t explain it, since we were in total darkness, but I felt as though his body was very close to mine. I shrugged, even though we were in total blackness. \u201cBecause it seems whenever I experience a terrible vision of the monster making a kill, it\u2019s not long after that you appear. That concerns me.\u201d</p><p>I felt the brush of his whisper against the column of my neck when he spoke. \u201cDo you still think he and I are one and the same?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, not at all. I\u2019ve seen his skin, his arms\u2014they\u2019re not yours. But they\u2019re Valerian\u2019s, aren\u2019t they? Manifested in another newling he created?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ve paid such close attention to my physical detail makes me happy,\u201d Victorian said, and that warm breath brushed my cheek. \u201cVery happy. And to agree, yes. I fear your monster is my brother. He\u2019s even more powerful than I ever was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hold on there, Tonto,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t get too wound up. It\u2019s kinda noticeable that you have youthful pale skin. The monster has older, tanned-like-leather skin. Didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou wound me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I said, resting my head against whatever hard thing was behind me. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere, with you,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd see what a good boy I\u2019m being? Not once have I asked you to grope me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreaking miracle,\u201d I answered, and he laughed again.</p><p>\u201cIt should hopefully win me points,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were working on a points system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d work on anything to get in your good graces,\u201d he said somberly. \u201cIf only you knew how much so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Vick, you\u2019re not too difficult to read,\u201d I answered. \u201cHow is it you\u2019re able to totally block Eli from reading my thoughts, or yours, when we have these rendezvous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Is that what you consider our encounters? I think that turns me on, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t turn you on, Vick? Now answer the question please.\u201d</p><p>Victorian sighed. \u201cVery well. It\u2019s my strigoi nature. That part of my DNA is more potent than you can possibly imagine. You, Riley, have powers that have simply not manifested yet. When they do, you will ... Let\u2019s just say you will be amazed. Anyway, I am able to implant my thoughts, myself, into your thoughts and mind and keep any and all intruders out. I\u2019m selfish that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd it also leads me to know that you have complete control over me. You can make me do whatever you want, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI confess, it\u2019s true. But because I\u2019m a gentleman, I restrain.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cYou get another point, then, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s bothering you,\u201d he said next. \u201cI can tell. What is it?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYou mean besides my being linked in a killer\u2019s body while he feeds?\u201d I asked.</p><p>With a soft chuckle, Victorian answered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed a vampire tonight,\u201d I said. \u201cShe was young, and it bothers me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt was either you or her, and I for one am more than glad you emerged the victor.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cGod, Victorian, you\u2019ve got to brush up on your modern lingo. You sound like an old fart talking that way. Sometimes I forget you\u2019re so old.\u201d</p><p>Victorian laughed. \u201cPerhaps I do. Maybe you should teach me your modern lingo? Now, finish telling this old fart why killing the female vampire bothered you.\u201d</p><p>I thought for a second. \u201cBecause she was young. Before she was a vampire, a killer, she was a human. Someone\u2019s sister, someone\u2019s daughter. Someone\u2019s loved one. It just makes me sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all were, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>I sighed again. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as much as I\u2019d love to use my wiles to win your heart, or better yet,\u201d he said seductively, \u201cjust do as I want with you, I shall not. To show you my restraint, I will leave you now, untouched, unkissed, and without orgasm\u2014although it pains me to do so. You are a breathtaking beauty while in the throes of passion. It\u2019s a vision I see inside my head all the time. A true vision of beauty. Good night, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Vick,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to stop me?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNo. Get out of here\u2014wherever here is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wherever you want it to be....</p><p>The week passed\u2014flew by actually. We worked well as a newling/vamp/quickening victim recovery team. We hit every seedy club after hours we could find and rounded up at least a dozen and a half newlings and almost-newlings. Only two were destroyed, but it was unavoidable. They were freaking everywhere, and not all were being ruled by the monster. I call him the monster, even though I know he was a newly manifested Valerian. We still haven\u2019t tracked him, but we will. He\u2019s here. We all feel it.</p><p>We hit the fight club on the appointed night. The newlings were looking for me. Why I had impressed them so much, I had no clue. There were some pretty badass chicks in the club; none with the same DNA as me, I guess, and that made a difference. I quickly rose to the top as a club favorite. Seth hated it. Eli hated it. Noah and Luc loved it. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they were taking bets on the side. Phin and Zetty were unreadable. I\u2019d be in the ring, fighting a guy, a girl\u2014didn\u2019t matter. My gaze would scan, catch either of theirs, and I\u2019d see pride mixed with a hooded scolding look that nearly cracked me up.</p><p>Zetty\u2014now that was a fighter right there. I\u2019m pretty sure his unique tats across his forehead and his sheer size made him a ringside favorite, just like mine did. He was a silent fighter, though. His expression hardly changed at all, even when some crazy ass high on crack would slug him in the jaw. I swear, he was probably exactly the same even before he had tendencies. Zet-Man was cool as shit, and I was damn glad he was on our side.</p><p>Eli\u2019s fighting fascinated me. I know, that sounds sick. But he\u2019s, well, a sick fighter. What can I say? Maybe it\u2019s the fact that I know he\u2019s holding back, and using a fuck-load of restraint to do so. The newlings wanted him to fight. They didn\u2019t suspect he was anything other than a cocky mortal, but because of his beauty, I imagine, they wanted him in that ring. I even think they wanted someone to take him out. And I was pretty damn sure they wanted that someone to be me.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t surprised when they had us fight each other.</p><p>They didn\u2019t give us any time to dispute it.</p><p>The crowd roared. Eli frowned.</p><p>I glanced out at the spectators and found Noah. A smile lifted his mouth. Dick.</p><p>Inside my head, I spoke to Eli. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Land a few on me for show. It won\u2019t hurt too much. But obviously, I have to win. So be ready to hit the floor.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>By the look on Eli\u2019s face, I knew he hated this.</p><p>Not one punch landed on me. His knuckles grazed the air next to my chin, enough to make my head snap back out of reflex. But mine landed. We danced and played for several minutes as if we were killing each other. Then, Eli hit the ground. He stayed. I won.</p><p>The newlings, despite their sunglasses, zeroed in on me. We were to come back for the final rally in two more nights. Meanwhile, we ran the city.</p><p>And I, unfortunately, witnessed three more kills.</p><p>We\u2019d been in Charleston more than a week now, and, after the last run, I hit the bed, exhausted. Eli was always there, attentive, seductive, sexy as hell. He awakened my tired body, making me feel more alive than ever. Just the brush of his lips over my skin aroused me. He was one drug I never wanted rehab from. Finally, spent from mind-blowing sex, I fell into a deep slumber. No dreams awakened me. Even Victorian left me alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I finally did rise, I was surprised to find it was nearly one p.m. I was also surprised to find Eli gone.</p><p>Deciding he must be out with his brothers, I yawned, content.</p><p>I\u2019d thought mortals with tendencies didn\u2019t require as much sleep as regular Joe Schmoe mortals. Guess I was the exception. I showered; memories of last night with Eli swamped me, and, as corny as it sounds, they made me feel whole. Then, I wrapped a towel around my wet body and wandered out onto the veranda. A large leaf-shaped paddle fan whirred in the breeze above my head, and the long fronds of the Boston ferns swayed in white wicker baskets. I leaned over the balcony as though I weren\u2019t here with a load of vampires hunting evil newling vampires and one sadistic vampire, and I peered at the harbor, the sparkling water of the Atlantic, the palm-lined walk of the battery. For a solid second, I closed my eyes and indulged, pretending to be on a weekend getaway with\u2014</p> <p>\u201cMornin\u2019, sunshine.\u201d</p><p>I jumped and turned to find Noah standing directly behind me. I narrowed my eyes. Only then did I inhale that weird spicy scent of his that kept me from humping his leg. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed, then pushed a stray dread behind his ear. I always had the perception that dreads were gross\u2014stinky clumps of unwashed hair. Noah\u2019s were anything but. They actually smelled good.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThank you. I try to take care of myself. And to answer your other question, nothin\u2019, babe. Just chillin\u2019.\u201d He gave my toweled body the once-over\u2014a long once-over. \u201cYou got any silver hidden under all that fluff?\u201d he asked, inclining his head toward my oversized white towel. His silver eyes winked in the daylight.</p><p>\u201cPiss me off and find out,\u201d I answered.</p> <p>He laughed again. \u201cAlways a tough ass, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. Yes\u2014the dead-sexy vampire with dreads rolled his freaking eyes. \u201cOh, dead sexy, yeah?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI said, turn around. I want to see the dragon on your back.\u201d</p><p>I laughed but dropped my towel a bit in the back and turned around. \u201cDude, that line is lame. I get twenty requests a day to check out my dragon.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cVampires, dudes, undead, humans\u2014all the same.\u201d</p> <p>Noah\u2019s breath and fingertips brushed my bare back as he inspected\u2014cough cough\u2014my dragon tattoo. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I turned back around and met his mercury gaze. \u201cWeenies! You all think with your weenies!\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes softened and held mine. A slight smile lifted the corner of his mouth. He shook his head and turned away. \u201cLike I said\u201d\u2014he glanced back over his shoulder at me\u2014\u201cEli\u2019s one lucky fuck. It\u2019s too bad he found you first.\u201d</p><p>I lifted a brow.</p><p>His grin spread to full-on, white-teeth-bared brightness. He laughed.</p><p>And then he walked away.</p><p>I stared after him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sack full of Krystal\u2019s down here,\u201d he called over his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I said happily, flung my towel off, and got dressed. Quickly fishing out a pair of loose green khaki hipsters with a wide leather belt and a burgundy halter, I left my hair down to dry, pulled on a pair of socks and my Vans, and hurried downstairs. Led by my growling stomach, I found the kitchen. By now it was two p.m. Seth sat at the table, chowing down. I glanced around.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Eli?\u201d I asked Phin, who was propped against the counter. I must have had a worried expression on my face.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Poe,\u201d he said. \u201cHe tried to tell you this morning, but you were too sacked out.\u201d He rubbed a hand over his head. \u201cHe ran out to Garr\u2019s with Jack and Tuba. There were a few things they needed before tonight.\u201d</p><p>I crammed nearly half the burger into my mouth. Yes, hoggish, but I didn\u2019t care. Hot, squishy greasy bread\u2014heaven. I was starving. \u201cWhat\u2019s tonight?\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>Noah dropped into the chair beside me and flung an arm over my shoulder. \u201cWell, darlin\u2019, a lot of things,\u201d he said, his mercury eyes all but glowing. \u201cFirst, a little dirty runnin\u2019. Then, a little bit of Gullah-Gullah.\u201d He grinned. \u201cHoodoo.\u201d</p><p>I chewed. I only halfway understood.</p><p>I decided I\u2019d know when it came.</p><p>Noah threw back his head and laughed.</p><p>The afternoon passed relatively fast. I dropped a call to Preacher and Estelle. They\u2019d already spoken to Eli and knew of our plans. I promised my surrogate grandparents we\u2019d stay safe and return soon.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said, finally full. I wiped my mouth on a napkin and swigged down several gulps of Coke. \u201cWhat sort of Gullah-Gullah are we up to tonight?\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>By the time the sun began to set, Eli, Jack, and Tuba returned. Eli walked in through the kitchen, spied me, and strode purposefully straight to me. Without missing a beat, he pulled me into his arms, and, despite my Krystal breath, kissed me full-on in front of everyone. Several whistles and yells filled the kitchen; all of which I imagined were everyone\u2019s except Noah\u2019s. When I looked at him, his gaze held mine, and he simply shook his head and mouthed, Lucky fuck. I laughed.</p><p>With Eli\u2019s arms like steel bands around me, I leaned back and looked into his eyes. \u201cWhat sort of hoodoo are we about tonight?\u201d I asked.</p><p>A slow grin spread across his sexy features. \u201cA little grave robbing is all.\u201d</p><p>I lifted a brow. He laughed. \u201cThe only way to end Valerian\u2019s reign is to entomb him again. That\u2019s not going to be easy. But there are things we will need.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, accepting.</p><p>Soon, night fell.</p><p>Everyone except Jack and Tuba left Jake\u2019s on foot and free-ran the city. Oddly enough, we encountered nothing\u2014no vamps, not even a mugging. Even stranger was that I didn\u2019t have a vision of Valerian the monster. I referred to it as a monster now because there were obvious character differences in vampires. At present I was living under the same roof with four, and at night kept company with eight in all. I trusted them all with Seth\u2019s and my life. Even the monster\u2019s own brother, to me, was safe. I fully believed he loved me, and although I didn\u2019t return the sentiment, I did like him. I knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt me despite what Eli and his family thought. And Eli and his kin, Noah and the others? They were Gullahvamps, as I started referring to them; Preacher\u2019s cousin Garr treated Noah and his bunch just as Preacher treated the Dupr\u00e9s. A pact to keep the city safe meant keeping the vampires safe. Not only did their centuries-old traditions of hoodoo magic keep their cravings to a controlled minimum, but it made them ... more like their true human characters, I believe. Take Noah. I can\u2019t imagine he was much different in life as he is now, as an undead. Crazy fuck. I liked him, though\u2014freaking fine as all double hell, with or without his weird antihump-me powder. He was a helluva free-runner, and an even better fighter\u2014a regular Tyler Durden with dreads if you ask me. I loved having the secret that he was a vamp concealed by some special hoodoo juice. As was the truth about Seth\u2019s and Zetty\u2019s and my tendencies. It was all pretty fantastic if you asked me.</p><p>We finished running the streets, and it was well past two a.m. when we descended the buildings and entered the Circular Church Cemetery in the historic district. Any cemetery, in my book, was creepy at night; the Circular had to top the list as most creepy. A mist had sidled in from the harbor and sifted through the aged trunks of the live oaks, between the marble and slate headstones covered in black decay and draped with moss. Swear to God, it looked like something out of a freaking movie. We closed the front gate behind us and eased deeper into hallowed ground.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it you guys can come in here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Eli glanced at me, his hand tightly holding mine. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. Hallowed ground and all that,\u201d I answered in a whisper.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re not evil spirits, Riley. Besides, Garr fixed the cemeteries here a long, long time ago. Just like Preacher did the ones in Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d I said.</p><p>We continued on.</p><p>At one particular grave, Luc, who was leading, stopped. Jack and Tuba knelt beside it, murmuring Gullah words I couldn\u2019t understand. With a pocket knife, Jack scraped some of the headstone into a plastic cup with a screw lid; Tuba, with his hands, pulled at some of the sod until he reached dirt. Retrieving a bag from his back pocket, he opened it and sprinkled the contents all around the grave; then dug a few handfuls of dirt, dropping them into a ziplock.</p><p>I was beginning to see the value of a ziplock.</p><p>Moonlight shined down through the canopy of trees and shot darts of illuminated glow throughout the gravestones. Seth elbowed me, and pointed; I followed his finger to a Gothic-y square-sided spire, jutting into the sky.</p><p>\u201cThe Unitarian Church of Charleston,\u201d Noah said beside me. \u201cSort of reminds me of Notre Dame.\u201d</p><p>I had to agree.</p><p>\u201cWhose grave is that?\u201d I asked Noah.</p><p>He glanced down at me. His face grew somber in the moonlight. \u201cElizabeth Mont Frey. Once, a very beautiful, highly respected woman of Charles Towne.\u201d He glanced at the headstone. \u201cShe didn\u2019t make it through her quickening before she was killed. Garr was saved by his daddy,\u201d Noah looked at me. \u201cThey were taken at the same time, by the same vampire. You can imagine back then, a Gullah man and a prominent white woman, together.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThey were crazy in love, those two. Things haven\u2019t changed all that much, I\u2019m afraid. Anyway, despite her blood being tainted by a vampire, Garr insisted she have a Christian burial. Even in death, her body exudes mystics only Garr knows how to use.\u201d Noah\u2019s eyes bore into mine. \u201cAlmost as if she knows his desires, and allows only him to utilize her gifts.\u201d</p><p>I stared into the silver depths of Noah\u2019s gaze. I nodded in understanding.</p><p>We\u2019d only just stepped out of the Circular Cemetery when Eli\u2019s back stiffened. Phin, Luc, Josie, and Noah glanced around, peering through the darkness. Saul, Jenna, Cafrey, and Tate, also on alert, began to move around the rest of us in a circle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then, they descended from the trees above us\u2014six newlings; all punks, all rogues, all ravenous.</p><p>Eli shoved me\u2014hard. \u201cGet down, Riley!\u201d he ground out. I flew several feet away and landed on my backside. I jumped right back up and ran to stand beside the one person I knew would let me fight\u2014Noah.</p><p>Eli growled. It almost made me laugh, how protective he was. Even after seeing me fight, he still wanted me out of the fray. The newlings lunged, Eli swore in French, and the fight began.</p> <p>I quickly learned why Eli was so concerned; they all seemed to hone in on me. I\u2019m talking long-jawed, fangs dropped, faces grossly distorted, hideousness. Slobbering and rabid, they all lunged straight for me. Eli grabbed one by the throat and threw him against a tree. His body hit hard, but in a split second he was up, eyes seeking me out.</p><p>It gave me just the time I needed to grasp the blade from my back sheath, aim, and fling it at him. I threw hard. The blade hit its mark and pinned him to the tree.</p><p>He screamed in agony; I ignored him and turned to the others.</p><p>All of my vamps had changed. I tried not to focus on that.</p><p>I found Seth and we stayed back-to-back; Jack, Tuba, and Zetty formed a circle and did the same. Rogue vamps fell from the trees like flies. Where they all came from, I had no clue. I didn\u2019t recognize even one of them from the fight club. They were rabid, out of control, and lunging almost faster than my vamps could catch them.</p> <p>Seth whipped a blade directly at one I swear was no more than three feet away. My brother was strong, and the blade hit hard, knocking the she-vamp back at least ten feet. Another blade flew by; Zetty had thrown that one and damn, he was one strong man. The vamp he nailed flew back and over the wrought-iron fence of the cemetery. It lay there, writhing, screaming, gurgling, until finally, it was silent.</p><p>Some of the rogues looked barely older than Seth. It made me sick; I\u2019d puke later. Now, we had to survive. I nailed four more with blades, one rapid-fire shot after another. I no longer waited to see if I\u2019d hit my mark; I knew I had.</p><p>I glanced to my left; Noah, whose beautiful face had contorted into something I\u2019d rather not remember, grabbed a rogue just as it lunged past him, headed directly for me. In one shake he\u2019d snapped its head off\u2014clean freaking off, like a dandelion head. He dropped the body and turned to me, eyes white, red pupil dead center.</p><p>I could\u2019ve sworn his lips curled into a smile.</p><p>The count had lowered, and although the remaining newlings continued to lunge toward me, my vamps took them all. Jenna and Saul had a pair; Cafrey and Tate had another. Although it felt like hours, only minutes had passed.</p><p>Before I knew it, the fight was over.</p> <p>Garr\u2019s men came and collected the writhing, pawing, scratching newlings. That was a sight all its own. I had a hard time believing they could be detoxed. But with Preacher and Garr, anything was possible. They left in a van, leaving us with the mess.</p><p>Eli was suddenly at my side, his flawless face returned to normal. His hands searched my body for injury; his eyes followed. When he was satisfied I wasn\u2019t hurt, he pulled me into his arms and pressed his mouth to my temple. \u201cYou scared the shit outta me,\u201d he murmured against my hairline. \u201cSuch a badass, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurvivalist,\u201d I corrected, but slipped my arms around his waist. His arms went around me, tightly, protectively. I confess I enjoyed it.</p><p>Luc approached. \u201cAll mostly mortals accounted for?\u201d</p><p>Seth chuckled, and he, Jack, Tuba, and even Zetty murmured, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Luc said, and glanced around. \u201cLet\u2019s clean this mess up and make like a tree and get outta here.\u201d</p><p>One more thing I hated about killing vamps: cleanup. You did not leave vampire waste lying around. It was a valuable hoodoo ingredient, and we salvaged every dust bit possible. Not to mention, Preacher and Garr now both believed that even a small fraction of a vamp left behind would be potential for resurrection later on.</p><p>To that I say, No, thank you, Monster.</p> <p>Cleanup took longer than the kill. By the time we finished, the first church bell tolled from St. Michael\u2019s. It was six a.m., nearly light outside, and the group of us were toting around dusty vampire guts in ziplocks.</p><p>We hurriedly departed.</p><p>As we left the historic district, Eli ran on one side of me; Noah, on the other. Noah glanced over at me. \u201cSo,\u201d the Charleston vampire said, mercury eyes catching the first rays of daybreak, \u201cbeautiful, huh?\u201d He was referring to my earlier thought.</p><p>I shook my head and looked straight ahead. \u201cOh my God, the ego.\u201d</p><p>Eli laughed beside me, grabbed my hand, and pulled me faster.</p><p>Noah\u2019s voice trailed behind us. \u201cYou\u2019d better keep a good grip on that hand, Dupr\u00e9!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to finish. I knew exactly what was on Eli\u2019s mind.</p><p>Noah\u2019s laughter followed us to the battery, where he turned and departed with his crew, back to the dregs of the city.</p><p>I later learned he preferred it there so to keep a closer eye on things.</p><p>Apparently, Noah Miles took care of disobedient humans just as much as rogue vampires.</p><p>As we entered Jake\u2019s, we all filed in through the kitchen. Eli led me straight upstairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to ravage you this morning,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cBut only because we\u2019ve business at Garr\u2019s this morning.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cWho\u2019s staying here with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosie will be here. Noah\u2019s only a head-shout away,\u201d he said, then frowned. \u201cBut I doubt you\u2019ll need him.\u201d</p><p>I gave Eli a slow smile. \u201cOkay. Hurry back, then.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me against him and kissed me long, slow, and just when my hands crept up his neck and into his hair, he pushed me gently away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he said, with another quick kiss and an even quicker exit.</p><p>I looked at the door he\u2019d just left through and smiled.</p><p>Quickly, I showered and fell into bed. I slept. I needed it. Late afternoon arrived too soon. Once we all were ready and the mortals had eaten, we headed out to the city. This time, we walked the historic district before it grew dark. We strolled through the city market, and Eli and his brothers and sister visited with some of the Gullah women selling baskets. They all knew the Dupr\u00e9s; I could tell they thought fondly of them.</p><p>Soon, darkness settled over the city, and we headed out of the historic district.</p><p>Atop the city, we ascended the buildings; Noah and his group met us close to the old burned-out church where the fights took place.</p><p>Eli grabbed me and spun me around. His expression tight, he looked ... angry. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how I hate your going in here,\u201d he said, his eyes searching mine. \u201cStay close, Riley. And watch yourself. I mean it. I don\u2019t want to have to kill someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Eli,\u201d I said, and grazed his jaw. His eyes darkened at my touch. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly have a death wish, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys ready?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Phin answered, and he and Jack and Tuba pushed in ahead of us. Music thumped from inside the hollowed walls, and I knew tonight would be way different from the other night.</p><p>Apparently, they sparred at the fight club three nights a week and, after that third night, they chose\u2014chose, and then fed. I was ready for it.</p><p>At least, I thought I was.</p><p>Noah suggested that Eli take Seth and Josie, Luc stay with me, Phin with Zetty, Noah with Jack and Tuba, and the rest scatter. Eli hesitantly agreed. We filed into the crowd, and I spotted the shade-wearing newlings immediately. They spotted me, too. I moved slightly away from Luc; I didn\u2019t want them thinking I had backup in any form. Immediately, the one newling from two days earlier approached.</p><p>\u201cI see you made it back,\u201d he said, his lips curling into a grin that caused a shiver. \u201cJump in whenever you see opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I will,\u201d I said, chin lifted.</p><p>I waited; I watched a few fights; I watched Eli over the crowd. Every time I looked at him, he was looking at me. How he kept his thoughts trained on the club, I had no idea. I tried not to dwell on it.</p><p>The fights were more vicious this night than the others.</p><p>The weak had indeed been weeded out.</p><p>Luc and I were standing close but not together. We\u2019d all managed not to be linked and had stayed apart while at the club. It had taken some convincing, but Eli finally conceded and didn\u2019t stand glued to my side. I guess he was sort of starting to trust my abilities.</p><p>Victorian, though, did not. He suddenly interrupted my concentration.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Riley. I don\u2019t understand why you have to fight. Let the others do it. You\u2019re too delicate, and I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of your getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>In my head, I answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve apparently not seen me fight, Vick. I got it. No sweat. Besides, Eli wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good for something, I suppose. Still. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Vick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that you have a nickname for me now. Makes me feel special.\u201d</p><p>Victorian finally left me alone, and my concentration zoned back to the fights. Some kid hadn\u2019t liked the way Seth had looked and had challenged him. We watched them spar now.</p><p>If that was what you wanted to call it.</p><p>I watched my baby brother take it all easy, slow, not show-offy like me. He reflected and ducked more than he fought; but when it came down to dirty business, Seth fought, and fought hard. I could feel his restraint with each punch, so much so that the ridges in his abdomen were flexing. He knew the force of his power, his tendencies, and no matter how much of a prick his opponent was, he didn\u2019t want them too badly hurt.</p><p>I was proud of him for that.</p><p>Seth roundhouse kicked the guy, who was at least a foot taller than he was, right in the chest and sent him sprawling. The movement knocked several spectators back. Seth followed him down, choked him with one leg, and dared him to move. No rules meant no rules, and when the kid tried to buck Seth off, Seth popped him in the nose. I heard the bone break from where I was standing.</p><p>Seth won that fight, but it was his last. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I saw opportunity in the form of another Billy Badass, and I jumped in. I heard Eli\u2019s hiss of disapproval from across the ring.</p><p>Too bad. This was why we were here. I wanted it to end\u2014tonight. We\u2019d rounded up dozens of newlings and those in the quickening. We needed to take the main vein of threat out\u2014now.</p><p>Pushing through the crowd, who recognized me from the before, I shoved the weaker fighter out. The crowd roared. My opponent was a big, burly, helluva guy; midthirties, shaven head, muscles on top of muscles. He stood no less than six feet six inches.</p> <p>He slowly rounded on me, the roar of the spectators so loud, I couldn\u2019t think. I kept my eyes trained on him. He grinned.</p><p>\u201cFightin\u2019 you is gonna be more fun than fuckin\u2019 you,\u201d he said in a thick, country-fried drawl. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll do both.\u201d He cracked his neck.</p><p>I simply grinned. What a big, brainless dick. \u201cIf you think you can,\u201d I egged him, \u201ccome on.\u201d</p><p>The big idiot circled me. He wore a dingy-white wife beater, cheap jeans, big leather boots. He wore chunky gold\u2014probably fake\u2014rings on four fingers, on each hand. He stuck out his tongue. It was extra long, extra gross, and he must\u2019ve thought extra sexy, with the gold ball pierced through it. Inwardly, I cringed. He probably had a little pecker.</p><p>I saw Eli in my peripheral. Noah stood beside him, probably to restrain him.</p> <p>A punch flew my way and I ducked; he missed me, and I dipped and popped up behind him. With a roundhouse I kicked him in the shoulder blades, and he stumbled forward. The crowd laughed.</p><p>He did not.</p><p>Foul words flew from his mouth, along with a disgusting amount of spit; I did not entertain him with some of my own. I watched him close. For a big guy, he moved with more grace than I\u2019d have given him credit for. He swung a few more times, and I nimbly dodged his fists. The last thing I wanted was my juicy delicious blood, tainted though it might be, spilled on the fight club floor with newlings all around. I let him get close, then swung upward with both fists clenched, landed it into his nose, two elbows to the gut, and once he was bent over at the waist, I kicked his knees out. He hit the mat with a yelp and a curse.</p><p>He tried to get up.</p><p>I landed a solid punch to his jaw. He teetered, swayed, then fell back. Out cold.</p><p>With the crowd cheering, I left the ring.</p> <p>Across the ring, I saw Eli\u2019s face. Mad was not the term I\u2019d use to describe his expression. He was ... more like a half inch away from changing. Tee-total pissed off\u2014at me or the dickhead, I couldn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cYou are so sexy when you kick ass,\u201d Luc said in my ear. \u201cToo bad my big brother wants to wring your neck for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I said. We watched a few more fights. I got in a few of them. Despite how good I was at it, I really, really hated it. I wanted it to end, the night to be over, the newlings put in their places, the monster caught\u2014not necessarily in that order.</p><p>Eventually, the familiar newling\u2014who I guessed was a leader of sorts\u2014approached me.</p><p>\u201cSo, how have the pussies managed?\u201d he asked over the roaring crowd.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>The smile he gave me chilled me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve only fought one decent opponent. Come to ringside.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Luc, and he nodded forward. I glanced upward, at the next level, and met gazes first with Eli, Phin, Seth, then Noah. Zetty and Josie were on our level and in the corner.</p> <p>They all had my back.</p><p>I shrugged and followed the newling.</p><p>And then stepped into the ring with a newling.</p><p>The moment I saw her, I knew it\u2019d be a challenge; she was lithe, young, and obviously had contacts in to mask her opaque eyes. But I knew. I could sense her undeadliness. She wore head-to-toe black leather, like some freakish postapocalyptic catwoman, and the look of sheer confidence in her face could have chilled me, had I allowed it. I did not.</p><p>I\u2019d learned a while back not to wear restrictive clothing to fight in; it was easier to withdraw my silver in baggy clothes. And since they were all hidden below the waist, I stripped off my tank, to the roar and whistles and cries of the mostly male crowd, leaving me to fight in a black sports bra. My opponent\u2019s eyes were nailed to mine as she circled me; I circled her. When she attacked, I held back not one ounce of strength.</p><p>She was a fury of fists and long-legged kicks; so fast I almost had a difficult time keeping up. Her abilities challenged me, provoking my adrenaline to rush through me, and I gave back just as good as she offered. She roundhouse kicked me in the jaw; I\u2019d almost managed to duck, but she caught me with the heel of her foot and it sent me reeling. The moment I landed on the floor, she was on me. I bucked her off and straddled her; she did the same. We both landed on our feet again. I lunged this time, not waiting for her. I came down, both fists clenched, and smashed into her jaw. She yanked me by my ponytail and brought my face close to hers.</p><p>\u201cI know what you are, bitch,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know what I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d I muttered, and elbowed her in the gut. She dropped me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll fight, then,\u201d she said. \u201cLike mortals.\u201d</p><p>Our fight continued over the cheers of the crowd.</p><p>Suddenly, another joined in.</p><p>I now faced two female newlings.</p><p>With a quick glance, I found Eli. Noah physically had his hands on Eli\u2019s arms. He was holding him back. And Eli\u2019s face looked thunderous. I ignored it.</p><p>I took one helluva whipping, but I kept them both off me. At least, I kept their fangs from probing into my flesh. It was almost as if they dared me to make them morph; I have no idea if they knew I carried silver. But because of the number of mortals in the room, I wasn\u2019t about to drop them.</p><p>I could have, but I didn\u2019t.</p><p>My body was rushed by both; I leapt and cleared them. The crowd cheered.</p><p>Then, the crowd grew silent.</p><p>Then, they started to scream.</p><p>Only then did I notice why.</p><p>The newlings had begun their attacks on mortals. I guess my cover, and probably those of the others, were now officially blown. I didn\u2019t glance around; I didn\u2019t have time. The two newlings in the ring with me were now determined to make me one of them. They lunged, simultaneously, and I had to concentrate and zone the screams out, focusing just on them if I wanted to stay alive.</p><p>As a mortal with tendencies; not a newling.</p><p>I bounded off one of them\u2014using her face as a springboard as I grasped the silver from my hip in midair and plunged it at the she-vamp lunging toward me. The moment she dropped, I did the same, crouched, grasped another blade from the other hip, and threw it at the other. She was ready for me, though, and caught it.</p><p>I grasped another, aimed, but before it left my hand, she lunged; a body flew in front of me, directly at her. They collided. Chaos was all around me, and all I could do was stand there and stare, dumbfounded.</p><p>Eli.</p><p>He ripped the she-vamp\u2019s heart out, as it was the only way to instantly kill besides using a silver blade. When he turned and spared me a look, it truly frightened me.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just that his face had contorted. I dare not even say what I really thought.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, Riley,\u201d he ordered, his voice a deep growl.</p><p>I set my jaw.</p><p>\u201cLuc! Get her the fuck out of here!\u201d he yelled over the crowd.</p><p>I turned and ran, but not away. Blood and killing were all around me; the metallic scent of human blood tainted the air, along with the screams. I was going to take out as many newlings as possible before I let any Dupr\u00e9 take me outside. I found one, his fangs about to pierce the throat of a boy no older than twenty. I was close. With Five Finger Death Punch\u2019s \u201cHard to See\u201d slamming in some random boom box and mixing with mortal screams and blood gurgling, I lunged, plunging my silver blade directly into his heart, just before his fangs made contact. I didn\u2019t wait for reaction. I sought another.</p><p>Mentally counting my blades, I totaled nine left. In my peripheral, I saw Seth and Zetty, both with gleaming blades in their own hands. I glanced and saw Noah\u2019s beautiful face transformed once again; Phin\u2019s and Luc\u2019s as well. And Josie\u2019s. I didn\u2019t look for Eli; I knew he\u2019d be one pissed-off vampire. I\u2019d worry about it later. After this.</p><p>This was over in less than thirty minutes.</p><p>I knew it was over when all was quiet. Some mortals had escaped. The ones who\u2019d been bitten remained inside; Garr\u2019s people would be here soon to collect them. I knew that because Noah had already morphed back into his human form and was talking on the cell phone. I zoned in and listened long enough to know that an assload of bitten mortals would be taken to Garr\u2019s version of Da Island this night. At least a lot would be saved. But this was still not over. Far from over\u2014just ... this was over. For now.</p><p>I glanced around at the ones who would never see life again. They lay in heaps of mangled flesh, blood, and bone; some with their chest cavities ripped wide open, their hearts pierced. Some even still pumped blood, and I had to wonder for a split second how Noah, his folks, and the Dupr\u00e9s could stand being in such close proximity of so much blood and not go ... nuts. That was the power of hoodoo and the conjuring of Preacher and Garr, I suppose. Pretty cool shit.</p><p>Without my permission, my body gave out; I dropped to both knees and simply looked around. I\u2019d used all of my blades; I was still covered in mortal blood and vamp goo. I felt as if I\u2019d been in a medieval melee, as if I\u2019d been fighting alongside William Wallace or something. This had to be close to what that\u2019d been like.</p><p>Minus the vampire aspect, of course.</p><p>I was drained. My head throbbed. I no longer had the capability to filter out all of the exaggerated sounds and scents of the city. I resisted the urge to cover my ears.</p><p>\u201cI wish someone\u2014anyone\u2014would turn that fucking boom box off,\u201d I yelled.</p><p>I waited; no one did, so I got up, pushed my way through the bodies of mortals and dusty piles of vampire newlings, and found the music. I love some Five Finger Death Punch, don\u2019t get me wrong. But I was drained; irritable beyond belief, and ... something else I couldn\u2019t define. PMS? Who the fuck knows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I picked the box up and threw it against the wall.</p><p>I felt my body falling then, completely out of gas.</p><p>Strong arms caught me before I hit the floor.</p> <p>When I looked, it was Eli\u2019s painfully beautiful face I saw, and I inhaled deeply.

Rule number four: the</p><p>double tap.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>My eyes fluttered open; it was daylight. I scrubbed my closed lids with my knuckles, then looked around, gathering my bearings; Jake\u2019s place in Charleston; king-sized bed; my own personal veranda. I glanced beside me.</p><p>One hot freaking naked vampire.</p><p>Eli Dupr\u00e9, damn him and his birthday suit, lay sprawled out beside me in the white down fluff of a gazillion-count comforter. I strained my eyes hard and searched the digital clock on the far side of the room\u2014three forty-five p.m. Damn, I\u2019d slept a long time. Eli seemed out cold, too. I didn\u2019t remember getting here, getting naked, or falling into bed. It made me wonder just what else I didn\u2019t recall.</p><p>For a moment, I permitted my eyes the pleasure of looking slowly over Eli\u2019s beautiful, flawless self. Dark lashes brushed his pale cheeks; tousled black hair fell over one eye. Muscles cut into his lean frame were covered by a layer of silky-smooth pale skin. Perfect lips, slightly parted, invited me. I was tempted.</p><p>I quickly glanced at myself again. Oh yeah, I was naked, too. I was totally tempted.</p><p>Oh my God! Had I had sex and didn\u2019t know it? What kind of freaking torture was that?</p><p>There was no way to tell until Eli woke up, I supposed.</p><p>I resumed my perusal, but hey\u2014I was a girl in love. Yes, I admitted to myself, I loved Eli, and it seemed like a long freaking time since I\u2019d just casually gandered. I did remember socking him the other night in the club, but as I inspected his perfect features, I saw no evidence of it.</p><p>I lay back, not wanting to get out of bed yet, and obviously not realizing how tired my body still was. One second, I was there, stroking Eli\u2019s skin with my fingertips, and in the next second I closed my eyes again, and I was walking along the riverfront, at a slow, leisurely pace. As I looked around, I saw several things that disturbed me. One, was the Savannah River Queen. That riverboat worked singularly out of Savannah Harbor. I continued to walk, and my vision was his\u2014the monster\u2019s\u2014once more. I looked one way and saw River Street Sweets, and farther down, the Hyatt Regency Hotel. I glanced in the opposite direction and noticed the SoHo Boutique. Through the storefront window I saw little Bhing, rushing around in her fast-walking manner, helping several customers browsing through her clothes racks.</p><p>My vision then moved with his, the monster\u2019s, and it settled on the storefront window next door.</p><p>Inksomnia.</p><p>Next to that, Da Plat Eye.</p><p>His eyes moved back to Inksomnia\u2019s storefront, peering directly at Nyx as she gathered her skull and crossbones shoulder bag and headed out the front door. She turned, locked the door, and started up the walk.</p><p>He stood and followed.</p><p>I began to thrash, to scream, \u201cNo! Nyx! Oh my God, please don\u2019t let this monster go after my best friend!\u201d Inside, my adrenaline rushed as fiercely as if I ran hard; I mentally kicked and screamed. It did no good.</p><p>He crossed the cobbles, stepped up onto the sidewalk, politely stepped aside as a passerby moved by him. His gaze found Nyx again.</p><p>We then passed another storefront. He glanced in. I looked.</p><p>He stopped, staring.</p><p>Somehow, in the reflection, he saw me, too. He recognized me and mouthed, \u201cHello, Riley,\u201d in the glass so I\u2019d see.</p><p>A slow smile spread across his unfamiliar face. He was just a random victim, midthirties, tanned leathery skin, menacing eyes. Valerian indeed knew me, and he\u2019d manifested his DNA into this new victim. He had a different body, but he was the same monster. Slowly, he lifted one finger to his lips, mentally telling me to keep quiet. Then he crooked that same finger, mentally beckoning me.</p><p>His maniacal laugh woke me cold turkey out of the vision. And at the same time, another voice infiltrated my head.</p><p>\u201cHe wants you to come, love,\u201d Victorian said, his voice angry, heavy. \u201cHe cannot speak to you in your mind, as I can, but he has found me. He speaks to me. And he wants you to come back to Savannah. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said inside my head. \u201cNo shit. And why, Victorian? Have you known his plan all along? Have you known who he was, where he was, all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Victorian said with vehemence. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer my brother. My brother died a long time ago. He didn\u2019t resist the evil as I did. He\u2019s, as you say, a monster. Out of control.\u201d</p><p>I believed him. \u201cSo what do I do?\u201d I said to him in my thoughts. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I at least bring Zetty and the guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll play only by his rules, love,\u201d Vick said. \u201cHe\u2019s in control. All I can do is tell you what he seeks. And that\u2019s you. He\u2019ll know if you bring anyone. He\u2019ll kill your friend if you do\u201d</p><p>I gave a short laugh that was not a laugh at all. \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can to help, Riley. Never would I let you be harmed.\u201d</p><p>I ignored Vick\u2019s last statement. A wash of dread crashed over me.</p><p>I sat up, still nude, still beside my naked vampire, who was still totally out cold. I\u2019d been warned by Preacher never to awaken slumbering vampires. Not that they\u2019d purposely harm me, or any other mortal, but being roused out of their vampiric slumber might cause a reaction they\u2019d not like. Or I\u2019d not like.</p><p>Much like the crazy-ass bird in my dream had crawled across the branch, I crawled from bed, doing my very best to keep quiet.</p><p>Valerian was alive\u2014manifested in another\u2019s body, but still alive. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how but what I did know was that the bastard was using Nyx as bait. In my heart I knew he\u2019d kill her just for spite, and I had to get to her in time. It was all coming to an end. Valerian Arcos was the monster. And I was going to kill him. He wanted to throw rules at me? Don\u2019t bring my guys? Don\u2019t wake Eli? Fine. He\u2019d be in for a big-ass surprise when I rolled into town.</p><p>I strapped on every sheath I owned and stuffed each one with every silver blade I could find. I pulled on a loose gauzy skirt, a ribbed tank, pulled my hair into a ponytail, and found my shades, Jeep keys, and backpack. I slipped into my Vans.</p><p>As I made my way through Jake\u2019s mansion, I noticed everyone else was out cold, too\u2014all except Jack and Tuba; I didn\u2019t see them anywhere. I took a solid five seconds to look at my baby brother\u2019s face; his smooth skin, his dark hair and brows, his relaxed expression. It was a very real possibility I wouldn\u2019t see him again.</p><p>I left before I bawled.</p><p>I eased out of the kitchen door, crept to my Jeep, popped the emergency brake, and made sure it was in neutral; I pushed it down the drive and out into the street. Thinking better of it, I pushed it a little more, away from Jake\u2019s, then jumped in, started it up, and tore up the street. Soon I was headed south on US 17, toward Savannah.</p><p>Hopefully, to save my best friend\u2019s life</p><p>And kill someone\u2014something\u2014that was supposed to be already freaking dead.</p><p>I grabbed my cell and dialed Nyx\u2019s number. Maybe at least I could warn her; tell her to get her ass to the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019. It rang and rang.</p><p>\u201cPick up, dammit!\u201d I yelled over the wind. \u201cFreaking pick up, Nyx!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>It went to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cGet your ass to the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 and stay there,\u201d I said. \u201cDo it!\u201d</p><p>Then I dialed the Dupr\u00e9s. Thankfully, Elise picked up. Valerian didn\u2019t want me bringing help? Well I damn sure would call for some.</p><p>\u201cRiley darling, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNyx is in trouble and she won\u2019t pick up her cell,\u201d I said frantically. \u201cIt\u2019s Valerian, Elise. He\u2019s the monster. He\u2019s manifested himself into another of his victims who carries his DNA. He ... saw me in a vision and has threatened to kill Nyx if I bring anyone. I\u2019m on my way home, but I\u2019d hoped you could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGilles and I will go look for her,\u201d Elise said. \u201cYou calm down, sweetheart, and drive safely. Is Eli at least with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. They\u2019re all in slumber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left alone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, are you in big trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I left a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Hurry. But drive safely, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>We disconnected and I raced up the highway. My ponytail all but beat me to death, but I didn\u2019t care. I hit Nyx\u2019s speed dial a gazillion times, but she never would pick up. Not until the last time, that is. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My cell phone vibrated against my thigh. I picked it up and looked at the screen. Nyx. I answered. \u201cNyx!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d an unfamiliar voice said. I could hear the smirk in his tone and it made me want to throw up. It was Valerian, but not Valerian.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her,\u201d I warned. \u201cI fucking mean it, Valerian. Do not.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed then\u2014laughed hard. \u201cSo you\u2019ve discovered my little secret, yes? Impressive. Unfortunately, I had to trade in my youthful body for this older one, but it\u2019ll do for now. You meet me at Tunnel Nine, just off Washington, an hour after dusk. If you\u2019re a good little bitch, you\u2019ll do exactly as I say. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to watch your friend here die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d I heard Nyx whimper in the background. \u201cHurry. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The line went dead. I knew what kind of monster he was; I\u2019d watched him feed multiple times. He had no mercy. Which meant I had no time.</p><p>If Nyx made it through this, it\u2019d be a miracle. My stomach lurched, my insides raged with fear for her.</p> <p>The only thing that could save her was the possibility he\u2019d want me worse than he\u2019d want Nyx. I prayed that was the case. Nyx would not be a challenge to him. She\u2019d be an easy, effortless kill. I, on the other hand, would be anything but.</p><p>Thankful the traffic was thin, I raced toward Savannah. Once I hit Interstate 95 South, I threw the Jeep into fifth gear and tore up the road.</p><p>I made it to Inksomnia, and I ran in through the back door. I\u2019m not sure what I searched for; I knew everything would be exactly where it needed to be. The monster\u2014Valerian\u2014hadn\u2019t come inside. He\u2019d waited for Nyx outside. She was with him now, terrified, and it made anger boil inside me. Out of control, I screamed, and punched the wall. My fist broke through the sheetrock. I sagged against the wall and sank to the floor, sobbing.</p><p>I knew I was being useless right now; crying and whining, doing the wall-slide while my best friend sat, prisoner of a vicious killer. What the freak was wrong with me? Why couldn\u2019t I find him myself? Why couldn\u2019t freaking Victorian help me find him?</p><p>Preacher would know what to do. Maybe there was something he could give me, I didn\u2019t know. To help me find Nyx? I concentrated\u2014hard\u2014on my new senses. Maybe I could hear her, if she was close enough? I strained my ears, and a flood of sounds fell in. None of them was distinctively Nyx. I sighed and dropped my head against the wall.</p><p>The thought lingered in my brain, and lingered a fraction too long. Just when I\u2019d made my mind up to run next door, heaviness settled over my body, weighed me down, nailed me to the very spot I\u2019d fallen to the floor. I tried to speak; I tried to move. My arms, legs were like anvils, and I could move neither. My insides wretched because I knew what was coming. Even in my paralyzed state, I knew.</p> <p>My eyelids fell, and darkness fell behind them, a menacing shadow that no matter how hard I tried to lift, it wouldn\u2019t. Finally, it did, and I found myself looking through his eyes once again; I tried closing mine, fearful of what I\u2019d see. I couldn\u2019t. I felt the pleasure he took in knowing me now, in knowing I unwillingly watched, partially participated, and it made me wonder if he hated me that much; that he\u2019d kill Nyx just so I\u2019d have no choice but to be a part of it. Nausea swept over me, but I couldn\u2019t even relieve the sick sensation myself by vomiting. He moved. I moved with him.</p><p>We were downtown, on the other side of Bay Street and over the bridge; an old apartment building, dark, a bad neighborhood. He pushed into a side door and entered the building, taking the first set of stairs to the right. Climbing three flights effortlessly, he passed no one. On the third floor, he opened the door and stepped into the corridor. A small dog barked its head off in some random apartment close by. Otherwise, no one was about. He walked to the end, to the very last room. The apartment number was 340. He knocked. The door opened, and relief washed over me as a woman, not Nyx, stood there. She stood in the doorway, in a short blue skirt that barely covered her ass, a thin black vest that laced up the front, barely containing the extraordinarily large, perfectly round fake breasts, and high leather boots that reached her thighs. A stripper, maybe? A hooker? A cigarette dangled from her mouth, and without touching it, she pulled on it, inhaled, then blew a plume of smoke in his face. Early thirties, she wore heavy makeup, thick black eye liner, electric blue shadow. Her hair, several shades of blond, was braided back from her face, then left to fall in dreads halfway down her back.</p><p>She removed the cigarette from her lips. Her nails were painted the same blue as her eye shadow. \u201cI have to work in an hour,\u201d she said, her voice low, husky from years of smoking. She knew him. And he knew her. He liked her.</p><p>She reached down then, grabbed my hand\u2014his hand, and pulled him into her apartment. Seductively, she leaned into him, locked the door, pulled the chain latch. She let her hand trail down his chest, down his stomach, to his belt where she loosened it and slid her hand down the front of his pants.</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d she crooned, her eyes growing dark with lust. \u201cCock\u2019s already hard for me, huh baby?\u201d She rubbed her thumb over it, squeezed, then let go. \u201cWanna show first? Like always?\u201d Crooking her finger, she beckoned him. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>She sauntered backward, then turned and moved seductively through the small apartment. He followed, with me, trapped in his filth. The girl leaned over the kitchen counter where she already had a line of coke, snorted it, then rose up, wiping her nose and sniffing. A glass with amber liquid sat nearby. She grabbed it, downed it, and licked her lips. Setting the glass down, she kept her eyes trained on him.</p><p>I fully understood her; the only way she could stand being in Valerian\u2019s presence was to first do a line of coke and down some liquor. Didn\u2019t blame her for that.</p><p>The woman moved toward him, then led him by the hand to an overstuffed chair in the living room. She playfully pushed him into it, then backed away, keeping her eyes on his. She began to sway seductively; her fingers grasping the laces holding her vest together and tugging slowly until her breasts spilled out. Wasted now, she licked her fingers, one by one; groped her breasts; grazed her nipples and moaned.</p> <p>His cock stiffened, and nausea swept me as I felt his excitement grow to a fever. He knew I hated this; he did it on purpose to torment me.</p><p>The woman continued her seduction; it worked on him. She moved toward him, slowly lifting her skirt, revealing nothing below, all hair shaven. She touched herself, moaned again, and as she grew close, draped one long, booted leg over one arm of the chair, the other leg over the other arm. She wiggled her bareness into his lap, and his adrenaline pumped hard.</p><p>With haze-filled, high-as-a-kite eyes, she stared into his. Her fingers fumbled in his jeans and freed his hardness. Taking it in her hands, she stroked it, and just when she was about to straddle it, he pushed her back.</p><p>\u201cSuck me,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>With a slow smile, she slid off his lap and knelt between his legs.</p><p>The moment her mouth encased him and she drew him in, he came. He grabbed her by the hair hard and held her mouth in place. At first, she moaned in pleasure. I never wanted to throw up so badly in my entire life. I bucked and writhed inside, and still, I could do nothing. I couldn\u2019t even close my fucking eyes.</p><p>He knew it, too. The sick, sick bastard knew it. I\u2019m pretty sure that turned him on as much as the woman had.</p><p>I knew the exact moment he decided to kill her.</p><p>He thrust once more, yanked her up by her hair, and stared into her eyes for a split second. Her large breasts dangled. She threw a leg over his arm, hoping there\u2019d be more.</p><p>There was, but not what she\u2019d imagined.</p><p>He changed; I saw nothing but the look of terror in her eyes.</p><p>Then, he covered her mouth with his hand and plunged his fangs into her chest, ripped into the cavity, and entered her heart. It pumped for nearly a full minute, warm blood squirting deep into his throat. Before the last beat, he flung her from him. Her body crumpled to the floor, her face turned just enough to stare lifelessly at him.</p><p>At me.</p><p>He rose, belted his pants, lifted his zipper. Without another glance he walked right past her body.</p><p>In the small foyer, he stopped, looked left, and stared directly into a mirror.</p><p>\u201cThat was for you, Riley Poe,\u201d he said, his voice making me physically shake inside. \u201cI thought of you while I came.\u201d</p><p>In my dark purgatory, I screamed, kicked, swore, cried.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cDusk, girl. Don\u2019t be late. And don\u2019t goddamn bring anyone with you, or your little friend will die way worse than this one did today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>My eyes fluttered open, and I stared into the dark brown orbs of Preacher\u2019s worried gaze. \u201cGirl, what you doin\u2019 on the floor? Git up now,\u201d he said, grasping my arm and helping me to stand. He peered at me. \u201cYou seen somethin\u2019 bad, right? I could tell on your face, baby. You seen somethin\u2019 bad.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI did, Preach.\u201d I hugged him. \u201cI hate this. It\u2019s got to end,\u201d I said, holding back tears.</p><p>He pulled away and looked at me for several seconds. \u201cIt\u2019s goin\u2019 to, baby girl,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise you dat. But you gonna have to pull some strength from down there,\u201d he said, tapping my heart. \u201cI talked to Gilles. I know dat Valerian monster has Nyx.\u201d He stared hard at me. \u201cDem Dupr\u00e9s, and dat Noah\u2014dey on dere way now. You watch yourself till dey git here, dat\u2019s right. Now I gotta go back to your grandmodder. I don wanna leave her alone wit all dis goin\u2019 on today. Might take her to da Dupr\u00e9 House.\u201d</p><p>I hugged Preacher again\u2014maybe for the last time. \u201cYou go take her there. I\u2019ll keep my cell on me, and I\u2019ll call Gilles if anything goes on. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cI trust you, and I know you been trained good. Be careful.\u201d And with a final glance, he left my apartment.</p><p>With a silent prayer, I begged whomever to keep my surrogate grandparents alive and well.</p><p>For a second, I could do nothing more than stand in the center of my apartment and try to think. Not an easy task when your best friend was being held hostage. But I had to clear my mind. Quickly, I strapped on my sheaths and blades. Then, I sat, but for only a few minutes. I put my head down on my kitchen table, my mind a jumble of wires. Then I found myself at the top of a castle wall walk, peering over into the trees and forest beyond. My palms gripped cool stone, and, as I looked down, I noticed the dragons winding around both of my arms. I wore a bejeweled shift; if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think it some sort of a medieval wedding gown. It was the first piece of clothing from my dreams that wasn\u2019t sexual. Amazing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why would I be wearing a medieval wedding gown?</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Victorian\u2019s voice said, softly, sexily, \u201cbecause it is what you secretly dream of. Marriage\u201d\u2014he leaned over my shoulder, brushing his mouth against my ear\u2014\u201cwith me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not,\u201d I insisted. \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d I asked. \u201cThis is not the time for one of our visits. What is this, your home? In Romania?\u201d</p> <p>He now stood beside me, looking out over the landscape. \u201cYes, it is. Beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He was silent for a few moments, scouring the land before us. \u201cAs beautiful as you, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictorian,\u201d I began, \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what, love?\u201d he asked, then chuckled lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t for a second think I\u2019ll give up my pursuit of you, Riley Poe. Never have I wanted another so fiercely. And I am used to getting everything I want.\u201d</p><p>Now I chuckled. \u201cYeah well, you can\u2019t always have everything you want, Vick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>With a heavy sigh, I turned to him. \u201cBecause you just can\u2019t. That\u2019s why.\u201d The present returned to me, and I looked hard at him. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you help me? You know what sort of trouble Nyx is into now, and yet you\u2019ve made yourself scarce at the most crucial of times. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me, his dark, liquid eyes troubled. \u201cI am in transit; it is difficult for me to connect. I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and rubbed a rough patch of stone beneath my fingertip. \u201cEverything is fucked up. Valerian recognizes me. He has even seen me in a storefront reflection, and in a mirror. He\u2019s captured Nyx and is tormenting me, threatening to kill her. I can\u2019t stand another second of it. If anything were to happen to her\u2014\u201d I sobbed. I hadn\u2019t meant to, but it escaped.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Riley. Don\u2019t weep. Please,\u201d he said, and grazed my wet cheek with his knuckle. \u201cI am trying my best to get to you. Please, hold on just a little longer.\u201d He leaned close to me and sniffed my hair. \u201cWhat else has my brother said to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to meet him at dusk, at this club,\u201d I answered. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he wants to trade Nyx for me. I\u2019ll do it; he has no idea what sort of a fight I can put up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo the others know?\u201d he asked, worry lines etched deep into his face. \u201cAre they aware of matters?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cProbably by now they are. I\u2019ve turned my phone off to rejuv myself before the big fight tonight.</p><p>\u201cThat comforts me little.\u201d He put his hands on my shoulders and turned me around to face him. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything foolish, Riley. I\u2019ll be there, and I\u2019ll make it better. Do you understand?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, Vick, I understand. Seriously. I got this.\u201d</p><p>Victorian then leaned his head close to me, and brushed his lips against mine\u2014not kissing, just very, very close. \u201cNo, Riley,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI do not think you do. But I will make sure you obey my every command this night. \u201c \u2019Tis the only way.\u201d</p><p>I jerked awake. Immediately, I glanced at the clock.</p><p>An hour before dusk.</p><p>Hurriedly, I got ready.</p><p>This time, the hunt, the evil, would end.</p> <p>Part Ten</p><p>TORMENTED</p><p>\u201cNo man knows till he experiences it, what it is like to feel his own life-blood drawn away into the woman he loves.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Bram Stoker, Dracula</p><p>\u201cI never thought it\u2019d end this way. Oh my</p><p>God! I didn\u2019t. Inside, my heart feels like it\u2019s</p><p>being ripped out, just like one of the monster\u2019s victims. The pain is so great I can barely</p><p>breathe, and I feel like it hardly even beats</p><p>anymore. I don\u2019t know how things are going</p><p>to turn out, or if I\u2019ll ever see the ones I love</p><p>again, but I will never, ever give up. I know</p><p>I\u2019m rough around the edges, I\u2019ve got a sailor</p><p>mouth, but when I love, I love, you know? I</p><p>took a fucking beating as a kid; I deserve hap-</p><p>piness as an adult. I\u2019ve worked hard for it. My</p><p>loved ones deserve happiness. I used to want</p><p>nothing more than to have my mother back. I</p><p>miss her! But she\u2019s in a good place\u2014a place</p><p>only angels like her go to. What I want now</p><p>are my live loved ones. I want Nyx. I want</p><p>Seth. I want Eli. My grandparents. I want</p><p>them all. But I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll get what I want</p><p>after all, in the end. You can bet your sweet ass</p><p>I\u2019ll die trying, though.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>I\u2019d ignored all calls from all acquaintances. It didn\u2019t matter what they knew or where they could go. I knew whom Nyx was with, and he wanted me. I knew that now. I figured Eli and the others would talk to his parents and they\u2019d all head this way. I\u2019d told Elise and Gilles exactly where I\u2019d be going, and what time. For now, though, it was he and I\u2014Monster vs. Bitch. No more newling puppets.</p><p>I prayed I would win.</p><p>I didn\u2019t change clothes; I didn\u2019t need to. I had eleven silver blades tucked away beneath my skirt, and if it took every single one to take Valerian down, I\u2019d do it. For spite, I wanted to plunge one of my silver blades into each of his eyes, just for making me watch the filth and horrors of his desires.</p><p>The streets were busy for a Thursday night; the humidity heavy; the brine heavier. As I pulled into the parking area for Tunnel 9, the scent of stale urine assaulted me. I choked back a gag, slipped out, and looked around. Several cars filled the parking lot; heavy metal thumped against the walls from inside, and I could hear people pissing in the toilets near the back of the buildings. I\u2019d turned on all my senses and wasn\u2019t about to go unarmed. My best friend was in there. My worst enemy held her against her will. He had the ability to rip her heart out.</p><p>I\u2019d rip his out first.</p><p>I filed in behind a group of people walking in; young twenties, dressed to the hilt, completely unaware of what sort of monsters really exist. I know most people don\u2019t believe in monsters; I didn\u2019t for a while. I damn sure as hell believed now. I believed in a lot of things now.</p><p>Inside, smoke filled the room; smoking was against the law, but somehow, places still got away with it. The place, newly opened, reminded me a lot of the Panic Room. As the crowd jumped and moved to the music, I weaved in and out, keeping a low pro, and inching my way to a place that seemed all-too familiar. I was drawn to the back, just like at the Panic Room.</p><p>Riley! Please help me!</p><p>I heard Nyx\u2019s voice and glanced frantically around. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d I shouted.</p><p>The couple next to me glanced at me as if I were nuts.</p><p>In the back! Please! I\u2019m so scared!</p><p>I wanted to run\u2014I couldn\u2019t. People were crammed into the club like friggin\u2019 sardines. I pushed my way to the back, elbowing, squeezing, and just when I thought I would cut through to the back, I felt a vision creeping up on me. Oh God! No! Please don\u2019t let it be, please don\u2019t let it be ...</p><p>Near the back wall, I sank to the floor, shadows filled my eyes, and I saw nothing. Then, slowly, light filtered in. Dead silence surrounded me. A familiar scent rose to my nostrils\u2014Downy fabric softener. I glanced around. I was standing inside my old apartment, in the foyer, by the front door.</p><p>It was the apartment Seth and I had shared with Mom.</p><p>I blinked; in the very next second I slammed the door behind me. \u201cMom! Are you even freaking here?\u201d Irritated, I sighed and moved to the kitchen, opened the fridge, and drank from the orange juice carton. When I was finished, I put an empty carton back. \u201cHey\u2014Mom! Come on, dammit! I need some money!\u201d I waited, my irritation growing at why in hell she wasn\u2019t answering. Angry now, I stomped to the back, pausing long enough in the hall to stare at myself in the mirror. Thick black liner rimmed my eyes and swept outward, like Cleopatra, and grazed my angel wing tattoo. It looked fucking wicked if you asked me. Mom hated it, though. \u201cHey!\u201d I shouted, angrier. It pulled me away from the mirror, and I stomped to Mom\u2019s room and looked around. The bed was unmade, clothes strewn on the floor, the lamp broken on the floor beside the nightstand. What the hell? \u201cMom!\u201d I yelled, and noticed the bathroom door ajar. I hurried to it and flung open the door. I froze as my eyes locked on to my mother\u2019s. Hers were unseeing, lifeless. She lay in a half-filled tub of water, naked. My heart leapt to my throat. \u201cMom!\u201d I hollered, in a totally different tone now. My heart slammed inside me; fear choked me. \u201cMom, Mom!\u201d I continued to shout. I grabbed her by her shoulders and tried to drag her out of the tub. Her body was cold; wet, and a little stiff. Her body slipped, and she sank back into the water. \u201cNo!\u201d I cried, and grabbed her again, this time more tightly, under the arms. I pulled, sank all of my weight onto my heels, and heaved until her body slid, over the rim of the tub, and fully onto me. We both fell back onto the tile floor.</p><p>It was then I noticed the blood.</p><p>The blood, and the rip in her chest where her heart should have been.</p><p>I shook her then, hard. \u201cMom!\u201d I yelled into her ear. \u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>Nothing. My mother was dead, already starting to stiffen, cold.</p><p>Sobs wracked my body, and I held her tightly, crying her name, over and over and over. I don\u2019t know how long I lay there, soaked, my mother\u2019s dead body on top of mine, cradled in my arms. It must have been a long time, because my teeth chattered, and my insides shook continuously and uncontrollably until the black-as-night man\u2014my mother\u2019s employer\u2014pulled me away from her. My fingers wrapped around her now-dried skin and refused to let go.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in shock,\u201d I heard a slightly accented voice say. \u201cIf she\u2019s lucky, she won\u2019t remember any of this, Preacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she don remember, dat\u2019s right,\u201d the black man said. \u201cDat poor baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley! Get up!\u201d</p><p>I heard a faint laugh, somewhere deep, somewhere far, far away. It was Valerian\u2019s laugh.</p><p>I turned. My eyes widened in shock at the person whose tight grip on my forearms was pulling me off the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victorian.</p><p>He pulled me close, his hands on my elbows; he brought his mouth to my ear. \u201cHe is here, love,\u201d he said, his breath brushing my skin. \u201cPlease, come with me. I swear to you I\u2019ll get your friend to safety.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back and sought Victorian\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou will come with me, Riley. Now,\u201d he said, his voice alluring, pulling at my mind, into some unfamiliar zone. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>My mind was a ball of tangled barbed wire. I\u2019d just had a vision of the day when I\u2019d found my mother\u2019s body, and here before me stood a vampire whom I\u2019d known mostly in my dreams. In my heart, I didn\u2019t want to go with him. Somehow, though, he made me\u2014against my will. My actions were no longer mine. I couldn\u2019t help it; I reached out and grazed his jaw with my fingertips, just to see if he was real. He was real, and this was real\u2014not a dream; not a vision. Confusion made my brain ache. \u201cNyx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Victorian urged. \u201cPlease. There\u2019s not much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>Everyone started screaming at once.</p><p>Several newlings swung from the lights, bounded off the counters, the bar, the stools, and descended upon the clubbers in a rabid feast. I moved away from Victorian. My confusion erased, I shook my head of the intoxicating fog and I kicked into action. I knew what needed to be done, and I wouldn\u2019t leave here without my friend; with all these mortals helplessly falling victim to their bloodsucking prey. I blinked, my hand going beneath my skirt before my brain really registered what was happening.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Riley,\u201d Victorian begged, moving closer. \u201cCome with me. I promise to get your friend to safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I yelled, \u201cbut you\u2019d better get her now!\u201d I ducked and flipped a blade from my thigh. Just as a newling lunged at me, I plunged it into his heart. He began to jerk. \u201cGet her now, Victorian!\u201d I yelled. \u201cIn the back!\u201d</p><p>Victorian disappeared.</p><p>No sooner had he vanished into the melee than Eli, Luc, Phin, Josie, Seth, Zetty, Noah and his guys, stormed through the door.</p> <p>A second full-scale melee ensued.</p><p>Eli made his way toward me, his face livid, etched with terror and fury. He grabbed me by the arm and shook me. Anger and confusion mapped lines into his face. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>He didn\u2019t glare at me long. He took off. He trusted me.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>I took as many out as I could. Every once in a while I saw Seth. He was alive and kicking ass. Relief washed over me as he stayed, back-to-back, with Noah.</p><p>Just as I flung another blade, hitting my mark and turning another vamp newling to dust, my arm was grabbed again. This time when I turned, it was Nyx. She threw her arms around me. \u201cOh, Riley!\u201d she yelled, and squeezed me hard. \u201cI was so scared!\u201d</p><p>Relief flooded me at the sight of Nyx unharmed. I didn\u2019t have time to revel in it. \u201cGo to Luc!\u201d I said, dragged her by the arm, and gave her a push in his direction. \u201cLuc!\u201d I yelled in my mind. He turned, faced me, saw Nyx, and ran directly toward her. Once his hands were on her, I knew she\u2019d be safe.</p> <p>I had one undead left to kill. I pushed my way to the back of the melee. I was shoved, pushed, grabbed.</p><p>I was abruptly stopped by Victorian, his hands vices on my shoulders.</p><p>His gaze bore into mine. \u201cYou promised.\u201d</p><p>I yanked against him. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving with you! There\u2019s one more that needs to die first,\u201d I yelled. \u201cMy life is here! I love Eli, my brother, my family. You know me, Victorian! I can\u2019t let your brother live! He\u2019s a monster!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you must!\u201d he yelled back, and dragged me effortlessly through the horrified mortals. He turned when we were in a thinner crowd. I fought him, pulled, yanked, beat him in the back with my fists. \u201cNo,\u201d he pleaded, ducking further swings from my fists. \u201cYou cannot, Riley. Please.\u201d He grabbed my hands in his, stilling me. His drugging dark gaze pinned mine. \u201cYou will come with me. Now. Away from this.\u201d</p><p>My actions were once more no longer under my control. My adrenaline pumped, and my inhuman-like heart slammed slowly, methodically. I didn\u2019t want to go. Victorian left me no choice.</p><p>\u201cCome now, Riley,\u201d Victorian said slowly; it became the only sound inside my head. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way any of this can be resolved.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t leave. Valerian had to die.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t die, love,\u201d he said, close to my face. \u201cHe cannot.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t exactly understand it, but somehow I knew Victorian spoke the truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you on the way,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise\u2014this is the only way to stop him. To stop all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d he said, and pulled me effortlessly through the crowd. My mind and body were powerless to stop him; to resist him. We\u2019d muddled through a lot of people, and at the last second, perhaps because Victorian had eased up on his mind power over me, I yanked free and ran.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d he yelled after me.</p><p>I ignored him and sought Eli. I had to tell him; I had to explain. I ran up behind him, just as he shoved a mortal to safety, yanked him by the arm, and spun him around.</p><p>Eli glared at me with opaque eyes and pinpoint red pupils. \u201cGet out of here, Riley,\u201d he threatened. \u201cGo now!\u201d</p><p>With that, he shoved me, and with so much force I flew back\u2014far.</p><p>I landed at Victorian\u2019s feet. Without another word, he lifted me. \u201cYou\u2019ll come now.\u201d Once again I was powerless. He helped me to the back and out the door into Savannah\u2019s sultry, dark night. I knew Eli hadn\u2019t shoved me for any other reason other than he wanted me safe. I knew that in my heart. He was angry because I was in danger, plain and simple. Yet the thought of leaving him, like this, burned a hole in me, made my chest hurt, and made it ache. I didn\u2019t want to go!</p><p>Near the back entrance was a stone silver convertible Jag. Victorian opened the driver\u2019s side door. \u201cGet in, Riley.\u201d</p><p>Almost as if stuck in the weird, crawlin\u2019-bird-acrossthe-branch dream, I did as the powerful strigoi vampire commanded, and I crawled my ass straight over to the passenger\u2019s side.</p><p>He followed me in and jammed the keys into the ignition; the engine roared, and the dual exhaust rumbled. Gravel crunched beneath the tires as he threw the car into gear and slammed on the gas.</p><p>As we peeled out of the parking lot, I felt a heavy presence behind me. It was so thick, it nearly choked me. I turned my head, pushed the fuchsia bangs from my eyes, and peered through the wind and darkness.</p><p>Two figures stood, side by side.</p><p>Eli\u2019s gaze bore straight into me, staring hard after me as I drove away with an enemy vampire. Seemingly, to them, I went willingly. They didn\u2019t know Victorian had me under some sort of mind control.</p><p>Noah Miles stood next to him, his mercury gaze glowing. He said nothing. He didn\u2019t have to. Neither of them did.</p><p>Eli, though, didn\u2019t hold back.</p><p>\u201cRi-ley!\u201d he yelled, his voice hurt, in deep pain, reverberating inside my chest, inside my bones.</p><p>I looked until I saw him no more. We turned onto Martin Luther King Boulevard, then Interstate 16. We were headed north. Where to, I had no idea. I couldn\u2019t think; my mind was a myriad of emotions.</p><p>\u201cAll will be well soon,\u201d Victorian said, and put his hand on my knee. He wiped a smudge of ... something off me, then grasped my chin and forced my stare to meet his. \u201cI promise, Riley Poe. I vow it. I will make this right. You\u2019ll suffer no more, love.\u201d</p><p>As we headed out into the night, the ever-familiar brine of Savannah\u2019s salt encased me. I wasn\u2019t in my own body; I was in another\u2019s\u2014or so it felt similar. I laid my head back on the headrest, the hum of Victorian\u2019s Jag and the ever-pressing sadness of leaving my loved ones, making my lids grow heavy. I closed my eyes, only for a second. In that fraction of time, Eli\u2019s voice filled my mind, so much that I reached out, just to see if he was there beside me. It was desperate; it was tormented, filled with so much agony, it hurt for me to hear it. Yet I craved it, as I craved air to breathe, to fill my lungs, to live.</p><p>As vampires irrevocably craved human blood.</p><p>Neither vampires nor humans could help their cravings. I know that now. Both needed a vital something to remain alive. For vampire\u2019s, that something was more gruesome, and at the cost of human life, but still\u2014it was their sustenance, and they could help it no more than I could help drawing in a lungful of air. I know that now. I understand it a little more.</p><p>Eli\u2019s voice sounded in my head. He spoke to me, and only to me.</p><p>I\u2019ll cherish the sound, pained as it was, forever.</p><p>I will come for you, Riley. I love you, and I know you love me. I\u2019ll find you. Until I do, be strong. Do what you have to to survive. You\u2019re mine. You always have been and you always will be. I will come for you... . </p> </body></html>"]
