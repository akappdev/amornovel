The Buzzard Highway stretched before me, a narrow line of crumbling pavement vanishing into the dusk. Below it ran the Scratches, a twisted labyrinth of narrow ravines gouged out of the ground by magic three decades ago, when our world began to end. The old road skimmed the top of the ravines, rolling far into the distance, where the sunset glowed gold, red, and finally turquoise. There was something vaguely wrong with this picture, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it.</p><p>The Buzzard Highway took no prisoners. Step too hard on the accelerator, turn the wheel half an inch too far, and Boom! Pow! Fiery crash! To the bottom of the ravine you went. Only Atlanta\u2019s best and craziest raced here.</p><p>That\u2019s why I liked it. When a girl weighs a hundred pounds soaking wet, her glasses are thicker than Sherlock Holmes\u2019s loupe, and everybody under the sun makes fun of her because she\u2019s a vegetarian and blood makes her vomit, she has to do something to prove that she isn\u2019t a wimp. The wild, deafening chaos of the Friday-night Buzzard race was a strictly no-wimps-allowed kind of fun.</p><p>It was so peaceful now. So quiet. Just me and the Mustang. I had named it Rambo. It was a sweet car, built from the ground up for one purpose: to go fast. We understood each other, Rambo and I. Rambo liked to kick ass, and I made sure it had a chance to show off.</p> <p>My body was so light. It was an odd feeling, almost like I was swimming or floating through some feathery cloud.</p><p>A familiar face appeared in the windshield: pale skin, dark eyes, the long tattoo of a dragon wrapped around his neck, snaking its way down under the blue tank top. Kasen. Decent enough guy as wererats went. He operated a tow truck and liked to hang out and watch the races at Buzzard Highway. They were good for his business.</p><p>Kasen\u2019s lips moved, but no sound came out. He looked kind of funny there, sideways, flapping his lips in silence. What is it you want, silly person?</p><p>Kasen was sideways.</p><p>The sunset behind him was sideways, too, the highway running to the left of the sky.</p> <p>Oh crap.</p><p>Crap, crap, crap.</p><p>The phantom cotton clogging my ears vanished and the world rushed at me in an explosion of sound: the distant roar of car engines, the groaning of metal, and Kasen\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cDali? You okay, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>I tried to talk and my mouth worked. \u201cCool like a cucumber.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou know the drill. Hold on, I\u2019m gonna set you upright.\u201d</p> <p>I clamped the edges of my seat.</p><p>Kasen stepped out of my view, and I could hear him grunt as he grabbed hold of the bumper, lifted, and twisted. Rambo screeched. Metal clanged. I winced. Rambo, you poor baby.</p><p>The sunset turned and dropped into its rightful place with a shudder. Rambo\u2019s tires hit the pavement and bounced once. The left lens of my glasses popped out of the frame and plunked onto my lap. I swiped it off my jeans, squeezed my left eye shut, and climbed out of the car.</p><p>\u201cI flipped!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flipped.\u201d</p><p>Hot damn! Rambo\u2019s front end looked like a crushed Coke can. Water soaked the asphalt, leaking from the hood\u2014the enchanted water tank that let the car run during magic waves had ruptured. I must\u2019ve taken the turn too fast.</p><p>Warm wind fanned me. Technically it was the middle of January, but after two and a half months of severe freezes and snowfall, the weather got confused. For the past week the temperatures held in the eighties, all the snow had melted, and I had traded my thick winter coats for jeans and a T-shirt. You\u2019d think it was May. Magic did odd things to climate. Today it was warm. Tomorrow we could wake up to a foot of snow on the ground.</p><p>Kasen peered at me. \u201cWhy is your eye closed? Did you hurt yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s closed because my glasses are broken, and looking through one lens makes me dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSituation normal, all fucked-up.\u201d Kasen rubbed the back of his head.</p><p>Thank you, Captain Obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want Rambo towed to the usual place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d My races would be canceled for a month. Bummer.</p><p>Kasen nodded at the Mustang. \u201cThat\u2019s your second crash in three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Jim forbid you to race?\u201d</p><p>Jim was my alpha. The shapeshifter Pack was segregated into seven clans, by the family of the animal, and Jim headed Felidae with a big Jaguar paw hiding awesome claws. He was smart, and strong, and incredibly hot\u2014and the only time Jim noticed my existence was when I made myself into a pain in the ass or when he needed an expert on the ancient Far East. Otherwise, I might just as well have been invisible.</p><p>I raised my head to let Kasen know I meant business. \u201cJim isn\u2019t the boss of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually yes, yes he is.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s good that I wasn\u2019t a wereporcupine, or his mouth would be full of quills. \u201cAre you going to snitch on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends. When you die, can I have your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Kasen sighed. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make a point here. I\u2019ve been watching this race for six years now and I\u2019ve never seen anyone crash as much as you. You\u2019re my number-one customer. You can barely see, Dali, and you take stupid chances. No offense.\u201d</p><p>No offense, right. \u201cNo offense\u201d stood for \u201cI\u2019m going to insult you, but you can\u2019t be mad at me.\u201d I bared my teeth at him. When it came down to it, he was a rat and I was a tiger.</p><p>Kasen raised his hands up. \u201cFine. Forget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>The world blinked. The colors turned slightly brighter, the scents grew sharper, as if someone had dialed the picture\u2019s resolution up a notch. A welcome warmth spread through my body\u2014a magic wave had flooded the world. The distant roar of the gasoline engines choked and died. It would take fifteen minutes of chanting to get the enchanted engines to start. The race was dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I take you to dinner?\u201d Kasen said. \u201cI know this really nice place down on Manticore ...\u201d</p><p>Wererats always knew this nice place to eat. They munched constantly or they went twitchy, meaning they suffered attacks of hypoglycemia: cold sweat, headaches, and convulsions, accompanied by nervousness and bouts of aggression. Not fun.</p><p>I squinted my open eye at Kasen. There was no reason for him to offer me dinner. Most likely, he just wanted to butter me up so he could get a shot at Rambo after my demise. Too bad for him\u2014I might not have been the strongest weretiger or the most bloodthirsty, but my bloodline was pretty damn old. Lyc-V, the shapeshifter virus, and my family were good friends, and the levels of virus in my body ran higher than they did in most shapeshifters. The higher the concentration of the virus, the faster the regeneration. Normally higher levels of Lyc-V also meant a greater risk of losing your mind and turning into a crazed loup killer, but so far I hadn\u2019t had to worry about that.</p><p>I was hard to kill. Nothing short of a fiery crash complete with a giant explosion at the end would send me into the afterlife, so if Kasen was hoping to inherit my car, he would get a smoking wreck for his trouble.</p><p>I wrinkled my nose at Kasen. \u201cThanks, but no thanks. I need to get home.\u201d And get my spare glasses out of Pooki\u2019s glove compartment.</p><p>He heaved a sigh. \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Maybe next time.\u201d</p><p>I DROVE THROUGH the tangled streets of Atlanta with the windows down. The wind swirled with scents: a hint of wood fire, a dog marking his territory, horses, one, two, three, four, something tart and spicy ... The streets were deserted. Most people hid at night. The dark was when the monsters came out to play. Even nice monsters like me. Rawr.</p><p>The magic flowed full force, and Pooki, my Plymouth Prowler, made enough noise to shake the gods in their celestial palace. I\u2019d modified him to run on gasoline when the tech was up and on enchanted water when the magic was running the show. Pooki didn\u2019t go very fast during magic waves, and he was so loud he made me wince even with the earplugs, but that was the best I could do.</p><p>About three decades ago, Atlanta was the happening place in the South: all skyscrapers, trendy restaurants, and modern conveniences. Tons of money and people moved through the city. And then the first magic wave hit. Magic ripped through the world. For three days it raged, making complicated technological marvels fail. Planes dropped out of the sky. Satellites plummeted to the ground. Guns jammed or misfired. Electricity vanished and the cities went dark. Three days later, technology returned, but the world was never the same.</p><p>People said the magic came out of nowhere, but my grandmother told me she felt it building for years. It made total sense, considering the historical pattern of the First Shift, the one that was lost in antiquity. Approximately six thousand years ago, Homo sapiens had built a great civilization based solely on magic. It generated so much magic that the balance between technology and magic was permanently disrupted. The world seesawed way over to the technology side to compensate. The ancient civilization suffered an apocalypse, and the human race began rebuilding, this time using technology as its base. Of course, they created a civilization so technologically advanced that the seesaw shifted once again. The magic had to come back and crashed the party. Now it flooded the world in waves, one moment here, eating tall buildings, fueling spells, permitting manifestations, and the next gone. Apocalypse in slow motion.</p><p>It just goes to show that no matter how great a nail you give humanity, we\u2019ll manage to hammer it into the ground crooked. We suck. It\u2019s the nature of our species.</p><p>My house sat in a large wooded lot, all by its lonesome. The street to the left led to a ruined apartment building, now little more than a heap of rubble, and the neighbors to the back of me had fled the city a long time ago. I bought their land for a grand before they took off, busted the house up, hired contractors to build me an extra-tall privacy fence, and now I had an awesome backyard. With the trees and the fence, I could even go out in my natural form, roll around in the grass, and nap in the sun without anybody pointing and yelling, \u201cHey, look, a white tiger!\u201d</p><p>I maneuvered Pooki into my driveway, got out, raised the garage door, and carefully eased the vehicle inside. Of all the cars I ever had, the Prowler was my favorite. I loved the Indy-style wheels. That\u2019s why I never raced it. As much as I hated to admit it, Kasen was right\u2014I wrecked. A lot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lowered the garage door and stepped into my kitchen. A scent floated past me on the draft. I inhaled it and froze. It smelled of sandalwood and amber, spiced with a hint of tangy sweat and male musk. A shiver dashed down my spine, setting every nerve on high alert.</p><p>Jim.</p><p>The masculine fragrance filled my house, screaming, \u201cMate!\u201d at me so loudly that I held my breath for a second to get a grip.</p> <p>Jim was here, waiting for me. In my wildest dreams, I would walk into the room and he would kiss me. The picture was so vivid in my head, I shivered. It would never happen. Come on, ugly blind girl, snap out of it. Let\u2019s try to be less pathetic. Jim was here because Kasen snitched on me, or because he needed some obscure scroll identified. He wasn\u2019t here to make my sad little dreams come true.</p><p>I marched into my living room. \u201cJim?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>The scent was hot and alive. He was still here, or he had been here just a second ago.</p><p>\u201cJim? It\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing.</p><p>Fine. I followed the scent, moving softly on my toes. Living room, hallway, bathroom, bedroom. The scent sparked here. He was in my bedroom.</p><p>Oh my gods. What if I walked in and he was naked on my bed?</p><p>I would lose it. I would lose it right there and never get it back, whatever \u201cit\u201d was.</p><p>Get a grip, get a grip, get a grip. I padded into the bedroom.</p><p>Jim slumped against the wall on the floor. His eyes were closed. He wore black jeans and a black turtleneck, a couple of shades darker than his skin. His black hair was cut short. His leather jacket lay on the floor in a heap. Asleep.</p> <p>I tiptoed into the room and crouched by him.</p><p>He looked so peaceful here. Usually Jim scowled, just to remind people that he was Serious and Important and would Kick Your Ass if Necessary. But right now, with his head tilted back and his face relaxed, he was beautiful. I wanted to sit on the floor next to him and snuggle up into the crook of his arm. It looked like the perfect spot for me. Instead, I sighed and touched his forehead with my finger. \u201cHey, you. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Odd. Usually Jim woke up if a pin dropped half a mile away. Most shapeshifters did, but Jim especially. He oversaw security for the Pack and he exhibited paranoid tendencies. The only time he would pass out like this was when he was injured or exhausted from changing too many times and Lyc-V shut his brain down to conserve resources and make repairs. I smelled no blood and Jim\u2019s clothes were still on. But if he had passed out after shifting, he\u2019d be on my floor ... naked. I closed my eyes and gave myself a mental shake.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>I grabbed his shoulder and shook him. \u201cJim! Wake up. Wake. Up.\u201d</p><p>His eyes snapped open. His dark hand grabbed my wrist. \u201cWas I asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>He surged off the floor, dark eyes pissed off. \u201cYou were gone. Dali Harimau, where were you?\u201d</p><p>I stood up and crossed my arms over my chest. It wasn\u2019t much of a chest, so crossing my arms was easy. \u201cI was out. You\u2019re not my daddy, Jim. I don\u2019t have to check in with you before I leave my house.\u201d</p><p>A green sheen rolled over Jim\u2019s eyes. \u201cDali, where were you?\u201d</p><p>He had pulled the alpha card. You didn\u2019t argue when his eyes lit up. \u201cI was racing on Buzzard. There. Happy now?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Good? Since when was my racing good? \u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t check your messages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t go to the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat house? I told you I just got home.\u201d</p><p>Jim\u2019s eyes dimmed. He rubbed his face with his hand, as if trying to wipe something off. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>JIM SAT IN my kitchen, staring at a cup of hot ginseng tea like a demon was hiding inside.</p><p>\u201cDrink it. It\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>Jim gulped it down. \u201cIt tastes awful.\u201d</p><p>If I were a guest and turned up my nose like that at the tea my hostess served me, my mother would tell me I had shamed the family. \u201cIt\u2019s as though you have no manners. I offer you a gift of tea and you make funny faces at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to lie and tell you it tastes great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to say \u2018thank you\u2019 and tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Jim\u2019s face was grim. \u201cThe northeastern office on Dunwoody Road didn\u2019t report in on Tuesday. I was out doing other things, so Johanna waited twenty-four hours and sent a scout in to check on them. He came back disturbed. I talked to him this morning. He claimed \u2018something bad\u2019 was in the building and he wasn\u2019t going near it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett.\u201d</p><p>Garrett was lazy, but he wasn\u2019t a coward. Maybe there was something bad in the house. \u201cYou went there yourself, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jim shrugged. \u201cI had to go that way for an errand anyway.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t take anybody with you?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me like I had insulted him. Mr. Badass didn\u2019t need anybody to go with him, oh no.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to the office. The place looked empty. The windows were covered with dirt, like nobody had been there for years.\u201d</p><p>Jim and I looked at each other. The Pack had seven offices in Atlanta and the surrounding area and every single one of those would have clean windows. Normal people looked at us like we were filthy animals. The animal part was true, but most of us were sensitive about the filthy part. If you wanted to insult a shapeshifter, you told him he stank. We kept ourselves and our offices clean. Besides, you can\u2019t see angry mobs with pitchforks and torches coming at you through a dirty window.</p><p>\u201cI went up to the door.\u201d Jim looked at his cup. \u201cThe place smelled wrong. A weird scent, dusty, pungent, and bitter, not something I\u2019ve ever come across before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike herb dust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t it. Not anything I recognized. And it was too quiet. There should\u2019ve been four people at the office. Not a damn whisper, no sigh, no sound, nothing.\u201d</p><p>Roger worked at that office. And Michelle. I liked Michelle; she was nice.</p><p>\u201cI opened the door and smelled blood. The place was empty. There was a symbol on the floor in magic marker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a symbol?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. His eyes turned distant. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say he was confused, except Jim didn\u2019t get confused.</p><p>\u201cA Chinese symbol,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>\u201cLike a sinograph? Hanzi?\u201d</p><p>Jim gave me a blank look.</p><p>\u201cDid it look like Chinese writing, Jim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I got up and brought him a piece of paper and a pen. \u201cDraw it for me.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the pen and looked at it.</p><p>\u201cJim?\u201d</p><p>He growled under his breath. \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>The hair on the back of my neck rose. Jim didn\u2019t have perfect recall, but he was very close. He practiced, because remembering details was a useful skill for the chief of security. I once watched him draw a complicated tribal tattoo he saw for two seconds completely from memory. He got it nearly perfect. A hanzi character on the floor in the middle of an office smelling of blood\u2014he should\u2019ve remembered it. The symbols weren\u2019t that complicated. Something had fried his memory.</p><p>\u201cWhat was next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you.\u201d</p><p>We both looked at my answering machine. The screen was dead\u2014the magic had taken down the electricity. No way to tell if Jim had called me.</p><p>A green glow sparked in his irises and vanished. Frustration rolled off Jim in a hot wave. He was acting like a person with a concussion, but Lyc-V cracked concussions like nuts. I ought to know, I had gotten enough of them. Thirty seconds, and your brain was like new. Still ...</p><p>\u201cDo you think someone might have whacked you on the back of the head?\u201d</p><p>Jim looked at me for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cSometimes trauma to the head results in short-term memory loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody traumatized my head. Nobody quiet enough to sneak up on me would be strong enough to knock me out. I wasn\u2019t knocked out, I passed out.\u201d</p><p>Huh. \u201cPassed out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you remember before passing out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe magic wave hit. I saw a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman?\u201d Great, now I\u2019ve turned into a manga character who repeated everything everyone said.</p><p>\u201cI saw her in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>It stung like a slap. \u201cJim!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Yes, what, Dali? What exactly? \u201cWhen did you see her? What was she wearing? Concentrate.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI was in the doorway. I looked up and she was standing at the back of the room. She was wearing some sort of a long robe or gown. The fabric was almost transparent, like a negligee.\u201d</p><p>And he probably took a second to look at her boobies. Awesome.</p><p>\u201cShe had long dark hair. I told her to come outside. She said, \u2018Help me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn English?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe started backing up into the house and I went after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour shapeshifters are missing, the office smells like blood, you see some weird woman in a transparent gown who clearly shouldn\u2019t be in the building, and you run after her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to run after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout backup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the backup.\u201d</p><p>I waved my arms. \u201cFine, what happened next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember my legs getting heavy and thinking that something was wrong. Then I woke up in the middle of the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen minutes. I woke up tired as hell. I knew I\u2019d pass out again if I didn\u2019t leave, so I got up, locked the door, and got the hell out of there. I knew I\u2019d called you and I thought you might go to the house. The magic was up, so I ran over here, got inside with my key, but you were gone. I went to the bedroom to see if your calligraphy kit was still here, because I knew you would\u2019ve taken it, and then I don\u2019t remember.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then he\u2019d fallen asleep on my bedroom floor. \u201cDo you feel any different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now? Even after sleeping?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>Jim could go forty-eight hours without sleep and still be as sharp as his claws. That was one of the fun gifts of Lyc-V: improved stamina, immunity to diseases\u2014and crazy homicidal rage, just to spice things up. Something was seriously wrong. If it had been a typical curse, my magic would\u2019ve purged it by now. He had to go to the medic. \u201cWe need to see Doolittle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No Doolittle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim, you keep falling asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoolittle is a surgeon.\u201d Jim bared the edges of his teeth. \u201cIf he can\u2019t cut it out or stitch it back together, he doesn\u2019t know what to do with it. I have no symptoms. Pulse rate is normal, temperature is normal. I just fall asleep. You\u2019re Doolittle. I come to you with this story. What\u2019s your first move?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLock you up for observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I don\u2019t need to be locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know something isn\u2019t interfering with your regeneration?\u201d</p><p>Jim pulled a knife from his waist sheath so fast I barely saw it. The bluish metal flashed, slicing across his forearm. Blood swelled. The scent hit my nostrils, sending goose bumps over my arms. As I watched, the cut knitted itself back together, the skin and muscle flowing to repair the damage. Jim wiped the blood from his skin and showed me his forearm. The thin line of the scar was already fading.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick and my virus is working. Whatever this is, it\u2019s magic. Four of our people are missing, and you\u2019re the only magic user I have. I can\u2019t just leave them in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might be dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf they\u2019re dead, we need to know.\u201d He leaned forward, his brown eyes looking straight into mine. \u201cHelp me, Dali.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea, but when he looked at me like that, I would\u2019ve done anything for him. Anything at all.</p><p>I got up. \u201cLet me get my kit. We need to go see that house.\u201d</p><p>THE NORTHEASTERN OFFICE of the Pack sat on Chamblee Dunwoody Road, well back from the road behind a carefully cut lawn. Tall pines framed it on three sides, with four picturesque trees shading its parking lot. To the right, another copse of pines bordered a large open field converted into pasture. To the left, behind the buffer of greenery and a chain-link fence topped with coils of razor wire, rose short stubby apartments. The guard at the gate gave us a nasty look as we thundered on by and clutched at his crossbow just in case. Silly man.</p><p>I steered the Prowler up the curving drive to the office\u2019s lot, parked, and shut off the vehicle. The enchanted water engine took at least fifteen minutes to warm up, but leaving it running made no sense. The engine made so much noise I had trouble thinking. Besides, Pooki\u2019s top speed during magic barely scraped fifty miles per hour, and if we had to bail, both Jim and I could run much faster than that.</p><p>We stepped out into the night. Painted an ugly olive color, the office looked like two separate buildings had been jammed together: The left half resembled a ranch house while the right was a two-story Queen Anne with green shutters.</p><p>The wind brought with it a salty metallic scent that burned my tongue. Blood. Jim bared his teeth at the building.</p><p>I closed my eyes and concentrated, trying to sense the magic. In my head, the house turned dark. Long translucent tentacles of magic slivered from inside it, sliding back and forth over the walls, out the windows, over the roof, clutching at the siding and tiles.</p> <p>I pushed a tiny step farther. The closest tentacle rose, hovered above the roof for a long moment, and snaked over to us. Magic lashed at me in an icy wave, fetid, terrible magic. I didn\u2019t know what it was, but every cell in my body shrank from it. My eyes snapped open and I jerked back.</p><p>Jim caught me from behind. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>The house looked mundane again, just a drab olive building. I swallowed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need protection. Lots of protection.\u201d</p><p>I set my wooden box on Pooki\u2019s hood and flipped it open. Jim peered at the calligraphy set inside. Most shapeshifters didn\u2019t do magic, because we were magic enough as it was, and most didn\u2019t trust magic. I totally understood why. Magic was iffy, but claws and fangs produced the same result every time. However, I was born to a long line of magic users, so concerned with tradition that they passed on their knowledge and rituals even when technology was at its strongest and almost no evidence of magic remained. My family took my education very seriously.</p><p>Half of the time my magic didn\u2019t even work, but Jim had seen me pull it off once or twice. It\u2019s not that he was impressed\u2014he was far too cool for that\u2014but Jim treated my talent with respect. He was in trouble and he trusted me to get him out of it. I had to step it up.</p><p>Jim nodded at the house. A pale yellow light appeared in one of the upper-floor windows, as if someone held a candle up to the glass.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it cute,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s saying hello.\u201d</p><p>Jim smiled at the light. The only time a jaguar showed you his teeth was when he was about to sink them into you.</p><p>I pulled two thin strips of hanshi paper out, dipped my brush into the ink, and wrote the string of characters for general protection on each piece.</p><p>The ink shimmered a little in the moonlight. I held my breath.</p><p>Please work. Please, please, please work.</p><p>The magic snapped, sparking through the paper. I exhaled and tossed one strip at Jim. The paper sliced through the air, stiff like a blade, and stuck to his chest. He stared at it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess with it. It\u2019s a defensive spell.\u201d I tossed the other piece of paper in the air, stepped toward it, and it adhered to me, over my left breast. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Jim pondered the little piece of paper. \u201cYou want me to go back into that house protected by a magic sticky note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even start,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt\u2019s working. If it weren\u2019t working, you couldn\u2019t drag me into that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you write on here? \u2018Don\u2019t die\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wrote, \u2018Don\u2019t be an a-hole!\u2019\u201d I headed for the house.</p><p>\u201cOn yours or mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in that case, your magic isn\u2019t working. I\u2019m still an asshole.\u201d</p><p>Grr, grr, grr.</p><p>Twenty feet to the house. A shiver shook me and I clenched my teeth. You can do it, White Tiger. Don\u2019t be a wuss.</p><p>Fifteen feet. I could see it now, the translucent mess of sliding tendrils, ready to grab us, like a nest of colossal dark snakes about to strike. The bad magic would hit us any second.</p><p>Ten feet. The tentacles rose as one.</p><p>Screw it. I reached over and grabbed Jim\u2019s hand. His fingers closed on mine, warm and strong.</p><p>The magic shot toward us. I clenched Jim\u2019s hand. The paper on my chest sparked with pale blue and the tentacles fell away, as if singed by fire.</p><p>Oh gods. Oh phew. My heart pounded in my chest at about a million beats per minute. Pheeeww. Okay, alive. Alive is good.</p><p>I realized I was still clutching Jim\u2019s hand like a moron and let go. He was looking at me. \u201cIs everything cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d I nodded, my voice a little too high. \u201cEverything is great. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We walked between the tendrils of magic to the door. A long scrape marked the dark green paint, exposing steel underneath. I could tell by Jim\u2019s face that he didn\u2019t remember it. We both leaned close and sniffed.</p><p>Smelled like paint.</p><p>Jim tried the handle. It clicked under the pressure of his thumb. The door swung open slowly, revealing a gloomy large room, as if the house had yawned and we were staring straight into its maw.</p><p>He said he had left the door locked and I knew he would have.</p><p>Jim stepped through the doorway and I followed him.</p><p>The inside of the house smelled wrong: hot and sharp with an undercoating of dust, like rusty iron scrap left to bake in the sun. Through it floated the stench of burned coffee and a faint scent of blood, fouled with a hint of decomposition. The blood was old, at least twelve hours, probably more.</p><p>The front of the room lay empty. Ahead, a large counter cut the room nearly in a half. To the right, a small stove supported a teakettle and a coffeepot. Gloom pooled in the corners, and if I squinted just right, I could see the faint tentacles of magic snaking their way in and out of the walls.</p><p>Jim skewed his face in a silent growl, stalked over to the counter, and leapt on it, landing with easy grace. He did it in absolute silence.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>I would\u2019ve given anything to be able to match him, to be sleek and elegant, like a supple phantom. But no, even in my animal form, I was a klutz. The change dazed me and it took me about two minutes to figure out where I was or why. It took Jim about two seconds to kill something. If we both shifted in the middle of a room full of ninjas, by the time I could see straight, they would all be dead and Jim would be wiping blood from his hands.</p><p>All my life I was told I was special, the mystical white tiger. Guardian of the West, King of Beasts, Lord of Mountains, Slayer of Demons. Majestic of bearing and fierce in battle. The irony was thick enough to swim through.</p><p>Jim pointed at the floor. I looked down. Gashes scored the wood, digging deep into the floorboards. Something had clawed the floor, something large and powerful. Here and there small sections of black marker lines peeked from under the scratches, but no force on earth could decipher what had been written there.</p><p>I glanced at Jim and shook my head. He jumped down and I followed him deeper into the house. We passed a small file room on the right, separated from the counter by a partition. If people had died here, something must\u2019ve taken their bodies.</p><p>The doorway to the stairs waited, a darker rectangle in the dark wall. I took a step forward. Magic washed over me, bad, terrible magic, smelling of death and blood and corpses, as if someone had taken a piece of ice and dragged it from the base of my neck all the way down my spine. The paper on my chest shivered. I froze, trying to catch every tiny noise, every hint of movement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jim was looking at me.</p><p>\u201cBad,\u201d I mouthed, letting him read my lips. \u201cBad magic.\u201d</p><p>Above us the ceiling creaked. We looked at it.</p> <p>Another creak. Something heavy moved across the floor over our heads.</p><p>Jim pushed ahead of me and we padded up the wooden steps upstairs.</p><p>THE STAIRCASE WAS narrow and Jim\u2019s muscular back took up most of it. I gave him a couple of feet to make sure he had room to strike if we ran into something unpleasant.</p><p>Magic saturated the staircase. It dripped from the rail in long viscous droplets, it slimed the steps, it boiled in long coils along the wall so thick and potent I wished I\u2019d brought a rain slicker. Now, that was a totally irrational thought. It seemed insane Jim couldn\u2019t see it, but I knew he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>We reached the landing. A hallway ran perpendicular to the staircase, and right across it, a doorway was lit by a pale yellowish glow. I smelled lamp oil.</p> <p>Jim paused for one long second on the upstairs landing and strode on, through the hallway into the room. I padded after him.</p><p>A lone lamp burned on the floor at the far wall, illuminating a naked woman, who sat cross-legged on the grimy boards. Her dark honey hair hung in ragged strands down her back. I inhaled, sampling her scent. Michelle. But the scent was wrong. A living scent is hot, vibrant. This was a cold odor, laced with traces of toxic stenches: feces, a touch of urine, and a revolting patina of putrescence, like a meat broth left out for too long. Degrading amino acids. I\u2019ve smelled this nauseating cocktail before: cadaverine, putrescine, and a dose of indole for good measure. My eyes told me Michelle was alive and sitting in front of me. My nose told me she was dead and had been so for at least two days. I trusted my nose. It never lied.</p><p>Jim pulled a knife from his sheath. It was his giant G.I. Joe knife, dark gray with a wicked curved tip and a serrated edge near the handle.</p><p>Michelle turned and looked at us. Her eyes were empty. Dead eyes, like two dark holes in her head. And I had really liked her, too.</p><p>Behind Michelle, another body lay in the corner on its side, long dark hair fanned out on the filthy floor like a black veil. Roger, a werelynx. Dead as well.</p><p>Michelle\u2019s left arm jerked up and forward, resting on the floor. Her right followed, like she was a puppet on a string.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Jim\u2019s voice was a low snarl. That\u2019s why Jim was in charge. I didn\u2019t have to explain that something was controlling the dead. He figured it out all on his own and wasted no time on being weirded out by it.</p><p>Michelle\u2019s body turned, flipping her into a crouch.</p><p>Many things controlled the dead. I had to figure out who pulled the strings, before I could try a curse. Think, Dali, think.</p><p>\u201cAny advice?\u201d Jim asked, his voice casual.</p><p>\u201cKeep her busy, so I can figure this out.\u201d</p><p>Michelle\u2019s mouth gaped open, showing dark nasty teeth.</p><p>\u201cAnd try not to get bit.\u201d</p><p>Michelle launched from her crouch, hands outstretched, fingers like claws. Jim lunged at her. He grabbed her arm, the knife sliced in a furious arch, and Jim hurled Michelle across the room into the wall.</p> <p>I clenched my calligraphy brush. This thing could\u2019ve sent Michelle at us the moment we stepped through the door. But no, it taunted us from the window with the light. It made the ceiling above us creak on purpose.</p><p>Michelle rebounded from the wall, flipping in midair, kicking at Jim. He sidestepped, but she was fast. Her nails raked his chest with unnatural strength, ripping through clothes. Blood swelled through the tears. Jim grabbed her arm and twisted, his knife biting deep into Michelle\u2019s shoulder. Something crunched and Michelle\u2019s arm came away in Jim\u2019s hand\u2014he\u2019d cleaved the ball joint from the socket. Like cutting a wing from a chicken.</p><p>Michelle spun around. No blood spilled from the cut. She bared her teeth and lunged at Jim again, swiping at him with her remaining hand. Michelle was a jackal. They didn\u2019t claw, they bit.</p><p>He\u2019d have to mince her into tiny pieces before she\u2019d stop.</p><p>Something chuckled in the corner, where the magic knotted into a dark bramble. It was laughing at us. Playing a game, a cruel game.</p><p>Michelle clawed at Jim.</p><p>Just like a cat.</p><p>I began drawing my kanji. \u201cKill her now, please.\u201d</p><p>Jim jerked Michelle down. He cut in a vicious swipe and her head plunked down on the floor.</p><p>A dark shape coalesced from the knotted magic in a blink and leapt over Roger\u2019s corpse. I hurled my curse at it. The rigid white strip hit it between the eyes. Magic pulsed and I saw yellow cat eyes glowing like two moons at me from a round fur face.</p><p>Roger rammed into Jim.</p><p>The cat beast leapt in a blur, straight at me. The huge body knocked me off my feet. I flew and the back of my head bounced off the boards.</p><p>The cat clamped me down, its weight crushing my chest. A dark feline mouth gaped at me, exhaling fetid breath into my face. Pain punctured my shoulders like red-hot needles. I tried to snarl, but I had no air and only a small squeak came out.</p><p>The black mouth bit down. The kanji on the white piece of paper flared with green.</p><p>The paper burst into a dozen strips. They shot outward, jerking the cat off of me.</p><p>I blinked, trying to suck in a breath. Jim leaned over and thrust his hand down to me. I grabbed it and he pulled me up. Roger\u2019s corpse, broken and twisted, crumpled on the floor. Above it, a long feline body hung about two feet off the ground, wrapped in long strips of paper. It was six feet long and shaggy with orange and white fur, a house cat that had somehow grown to a leopard size. The strips adhered to the walls and ceiling, clutching the cat like the wrappings of a mummy.</p><p>The beast wasn\u2019t moving. Two paper strips had caught its throat in a makeshift noose. Its head hung limp, mouth open, a long tongue sticking out of the corner of its mouth. The yellow eyes, once glowing with bloodlust, were dull now.</p><p>I swallowed. My mouth tasted bitter. The cat monster was dead. My hands trembled from adrenaline. I had screwed up.</p><p>\u201cWHAT THE HELL is that?\u201d Jim asked. His voice was calm. His hands didn\u2019t shake. Cool as ice. Why couldn\u2019t I be more like that?</p><p>I sniffed, trying to hide the trembling. \u201cTwo tails or one?\u201d</p><p>Jim took a step to the cat and lifted two long furry tails.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nekomata,\u201d I said. \u201cA yokai.\u201d</p><p>Jim gave me a blank look.</p><p>\u201cThe yokai are Japanese demons.\u201d I rubbed my face. \u201cLegends say that if a cat\u2019s tail isn\u2019t cropped and some other conditions are met, it has a chance to become a bakeneko, a demon ghost cat. Bakeneko cats grow to a huge size and get supernatural powers. Sometimes their tails fork and they become nekomata, demon monster cats. They have the power to control the dead, take on human form, and can do some nasty things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they have the power to put people to sleep?\u201d</p><p>I knew he\u2019d get around to that sooner or later. \u201cNo. It\u2019s possible that the woman you saw was a nekomata in disguise, but it\u2019s not likely. She had you and she let you go. The nekomata is a cat, Jim. It\u2019s cruel and mean, and it likes to play games, but you know yourself, the prey never gets away. This\u201d\u2014I waved my arms around\u2014\u201cis complicated. Too complicated for a demon cat. They mostly set fires, steal corpses, and walk around in human clothes, pretending to be your elderly mother so they can get free grub. There is magic here, really bad magic. It kind of scares me. The nekomata is dead, but the magic is still here. Something else is going on. This isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>Jim tapped one of the paper strips with his knife. The strip didn\u2019t give. \u201cAnd this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the curse of twenty-seven binding scrolls.\u201d</p><p>Jim slashed at the paper strip. The paper held. Jim scowled. \u201cHow the hell ...\u201d</p><p>Kate, one of my friends, always said that the best defense is a good offense. \u201cBefore you say anything, yes, I know that the curse didn\u2019t function as expected and I know that it would\u2019ve been better to have the nekomata restrained so we could question it, and I was trying to do that, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s an exact science, and how was I supposed to know that the binding scrolls would choke the stupid demon to death? So you don\u2019t have to tell me\u2014I know! You try guessing some weird creature\u2019s identity and writing calligraphy while it\u2019s trying to bite your nose off and then don\u2019t come crying to me.\u201d</p><p>And that didn\u2019t make even a tiny bit of sense. I was an exceptionally smart woman. Why did Jim always reduce me to some sort of ditzy bimbo idiot?</p><p>\u201cI was going to say, how the hell did you pull that off,\u201d Jim said. \u201cYou made paper with the tensile strength of steel out of nothing. The physics of this makes my brain hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would\u2019ve said it and some other nice things, except that you jumped in my face and started sputtering and waving your tiny fists around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiny fists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the root of your problem right there. You always rush into things looking for a fight. You\u2019re like one of those First Responder magic cops: Ride in, kill everything, and then sort bodies into two piles: criminals and civilians.\u201d</p><p>My face turned hot. My body was pumping out all sorts of angry, upset hormones. He was chewing me out like I was a child. I was this close to going furry, except it wouldn\u2019t do me any good.</p><p>\u201cIf you take a tenth of a second to check if the fight you\u2019re charging into isn\u2019t there, it would save you a lot of grief.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get it and he would never get it. \u201cAre you finished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I turned away from him and crouched by Roger\u2019s body. Roger\u2019s head hung in a weird angle, and both of his arms bent in places where no joints existed. Jim had broken him like a twig.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re so special, why don\u2019t you tell me, Mister Always Look Before You Leap. I dragged my finger against Roger\u2019s skin. It came away with a powdery gray residue. I showed my finger to Jim. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure normal corpses don\u2019t do that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI saw that,\u201d Jim said. \u201cMichelle was slippery, too.\u201d</p><p>I rose. \u201cWe need to search the house.\u201d</p><p>We combed the house. We found no sign of the two other shapeshifters: Neither Mina nor August had been in the house for at least thirty-six hours. Their scents were old. I swiped the log from the front office and we escaped.</p> <p>Outside the cold night air swept along my skin, washing away the nasty magic. I headed straight for Pooki and opened the log on the hood. Four different types of handwriting filled the pages. The last entry was three days old. I flipped back a month and scanned the entries.</p><p>\u201cAre you actually reading this or just flipping pages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim? Shush. I need to concentrate.\u201d Shift changes, notes on shapeshifters caught in the city for one reason or another crashing at the house, routine, routine, routine ... Mina\u2019s entries identified different types of herbal tea she drank during her shift. Roger documented the patrol routes of three neighborhood cats, complete with battles for territory and places where they chose to mark it.</p><p>I kept turning the pages, and when I finally saw it, I almost didn\u2019t realize it. Thursday before last, August failed to come in for the shift change. The log showed him signing in fourteen hours later. His ps, gs, and ys showed longer vertical strokes than usual. I ran my fingers on the other side of the page and felt the outlines of the letters. August had pressed too hard on the paper. He was excited when he signed in, confident, angry, maybe determined. His reason for the failure to show up read \u201coverslept,\u201d which made no sense considering the amount of pressure he put on the page. There was something grim about the way he wrote, as if he\u2019d etched each letter into the paper.</p><p>I tapped the page, thinking. A nekomata was a Japanese monster. August was half Japanese, half white by birth, but American culturally. He couldn\u2019t read kanji, and his Japanese was terrible. Atlanta had a large Japanese population, with its own school and stores, a place where American customs didn\u2019t apply. August visited his family there, but he never quite got the Us and Them mentality, and being a halfer, he was looked down on. A few months ago he told me that one of his cousins was gay. August had gone to pick up the thirteen-year-old kid at Japanese school to take him to a family gathering and he\u2019d seen the boy sit on his friend\u2019s lap after recess. I had to explain that it was a cultural thing that didn\u2019t indicate anything about his cousin\u2019s sexuality, but it just didn\u2019t compute from his Southern guy point of view. He didn\u2019t completely believe me either and told me that if anyone ever picked on his cousin, he\u2019d break their legs.</p> <p>Magic tended to stick to nationality and region. People generated magic, and their superstitions and beliefs channeled it. If enough people believed that a certain creature existed and, worse, took precautions against it, eventually the magic birthed it into being. If you had an area densely settled by Irish, you got banshees. If you had Vietnamese settlers, sooner or later ma doi, the hungry spirits, would be haunting the streets. And if you had a Japanese community, you would get yokai, demonic creatures.</p><p>The residue on Roger\u2019s skin really bothered me. Either the top layer of his skin had turned to dust, or he\u2019d been liberally powdered with something. No creature I could think of could do that to a body.</p><p>Of the four people in the office, August would be the most likely to come into contact with a Japanese legend. We had to retrace his steps.</p><p>I flipped the pages. The entries were becoming shorter, more erratic. On Saturday some of them looked unfinished, as if the writer had simply stopped in the middle of a sentence. Sunday had no entries. There should\u2019ve been some. On Monday, a single entry written in Michelle\u2019s neat handwriting read, Can\u2019t stay awake. Help. m.</p><p>Oh shit. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go to August\u2019s place. We need to figure out why he was out on Thursday.\u201d I looked up.</p> <p>Jim was asleep leaning against the car.</p><p>\u201cJim!\u201d</p><p>No response. I grabbed him and shook his shoulder. \u201cWake up! Wake up!\u201d He slid to the ground, still asleep. I slapped his face. He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>I pulled Pooki\u2019s door open, popped the trunk, jerked the extra gallon can of enchanted water out, and dumped it on his face.</p><p>The water poured. Come on, come on ...</p><p>Jim coughed and shook himself.</p><p>I dropped the can and grabbed his shoulders. \u201cWake up!\u201d</p><p>Dark eyes looked at me. \u201cI\u2019m awake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep! Don\u2019t fall asleep, you hear?\u201d</p><p>He growled and pushed off the ground. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t okay. We were in trouble. We were really, really in trouble. I paced back and forth. My heart was beating so fast it felt about to explode. Something was wrong with my Jim and if I didn\u2019t fix it now, he would end up like Roger, a dry cadaver full of nasty magic.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>\u201cI am calm! Get in the car.\u201d Emergencies called for desperate measures.</p><p>He got in. I flopped into the driver\u2019s seat and chanted the engine into life, watching him like a hawk. He stayed awake. I dropped the parking brake and gunned it out of the parking lot. \u201cRoll the window down,\u201d I yelled over the roar of the engine. \u201cYou need wind on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he roared back.</p><p>\u201cTo see my mother!\u201d</p><p>MY MOTHER LIVED in a small cluster of apartment buildings in Riverdale. It took me more than an hour to drive over there through the crumbling city, and the entire time I watched Jim out of the corner of my eye. I punched him in the arm a few times to make sure he stayed awake. After the first eight times he told me to quit it.</p><p>I maneuvered down the smallish road and into the horseshoe formed by the squat two-story townhomes and parked in front of my mother\u2019s house. The pale blue light of her fey lantern filtered through the window. I climbed out. Jim already waited by the door, surveying the houses.</p><p>\u201cWhy are those three buildings facing to the left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is an Indonesian community, mostly older people who practice magic. They\u2019re more superstitious than usual. It\u2019s bad luck to build a house facing north. Some people believe it will make you poor. The subdivision street was already laid out when people moved in, so those three families chose to build their houses facing east.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad luck to build a house facing a field, it\u2019s bad luck to have the kitchen face the front door, and it\u2019s bad luck to build a fence taller than six feet. This is just the way things are, Jim. Just go along with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fence is taller than six feet.\u201d</p><p>I turned to him as I walked. \u201cI didn\u2019t say they were my superstitions. But they\u2019re important to my mother.\u201d</p><p>We headed to the door. The familiar scents washed over me: rice, onion, chili peppers, cumin, coriander. Mom was cooking nasi goreng, fried rice. I was home.</p><p>Help me.</p><p>Jim sampled the wind. \u201cIt\u2019s past one. Does your mother usually cook after midnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s special for me. She sensed us coming.\u201d</p><p>I raised my hand to knock on the door. Before my knuckles touched the wood, it flew open and my mother clamped me in a hug. Looking at her you could tell exactly how I would look in thirty years or so: tiny, skinny, dark, quick to move.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so dirty?\u201d My mother pulled a cobweb out of my hair. \u201cWhat is happened? Come inside. Who is this man?\u201d</p><p>Here we go. I took a deep breath and walked in. \u201cThis is Jim.\u201d</p><p>Jim stepped inside.</p><p>My mother shut the door and peered at him. \u201cHe is dark. Very, very dark.\u201d</p><p>Jim grinned, showing a tiny edge of his teeth.</p><p>I felt like slapping myself. \u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you do?\u201d She leaned over to Jim. Her accent was getting thicker. \u201cDo you have money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is my alpha. He\u2019s in charge of the whole Cat clan. Very important.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s eyes sparked. Oh no.</p><p>She leaned over and patted Jim\u2019s hand. \u201cThat is so nice. My daughter is so smart. Always respectful and well behaved. Never any trouble and she does as she is told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d Jim murmured.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t spend a lot of money. Two doctor degrees. Little problem with her eyes, but that\u2019s her father\u2019s side of the family. Very rare magic, a white tiger. One in seven generation. Very special. She can cure evil eye with a touch. And if you had your house cursed, she can purify it for you. Everyone respects my daughter. All our people know her.\u201d</p><p>Jim nodded to her with a solemn look. My stomach lurched. I felt like throwing up. \u201cMother ...\u201d</p><p>She nodded to Jim, as if sharing a grave secret. \u201cAnd she\u2019s a good cook, too.\u201d</p><p>Jim leaned a little toward her, his face deadly serious. \u201cI\u2019m sure she is.\u201d</p><p>My mother smiled, as if he\u2019d given her a diamond. \u201cBest match. Of all the girls, mine is best match.\u201d</p><p>Aaaaa! \u201cMother! There is something wrong with him. He\u2019s magic-sick.\u201d</p><p>My mother stood up on her toes and peered at Jim\u2019s eyes. For a long moment they were eye to eye, my short mother and tall, muscular Jim, and then she switched to Indonesian.</p><p>\u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cHe is strong. Very good in the body. But you must find another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want another one! I want him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to save him. Please help me. Please.\u201d</p><p>My mother bit her lip and pointed at the chair. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Jim sat. She leaned over and pulled his right eye open with her fingers, examining the iris. \u201cSomething is eating his soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that out. But I can\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>Mother sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t see it either. Until we see it, we can\u2019t do anything about it. We need Keong Emas.\u201d</p><p>The Golden Snail. My heart dropped. My legs gave out and I landed on the couch. The only place we could get a golden snail would be in Underground Atlanta. It used to be a shopping district in Five Points, where all the big buildings stood before the Shift. The Underground started out as a big train depot in the mid-1800s with shops, banks, and even saloons, but eventually the city had to build viaducts over the railroad tracks for the car traffic. The viaducts ran together until a good portion of the train tracks, the shops, and the depot were underground. Before the Shift, it used to be full of little bars and shops. Once the magic hit, the shop owners fled and the black market moved in. The mob-sponsored traders had burrowed deep, cutting tunnels running from their shops right into the ruined Five Points and Unicorn Lane, where the magic ran wild and no sane cop would follow them. Now the Underground was a place where you could buy anything if you were desperate enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs there any other way?\u201d</p><p>My mother shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. You can\u2019t go to the Underground.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled, blinking. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</p> <p>My mother made a short cutting motion with her hand. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We need to buy the snail.\u201d</p><p>My mother drew herself to her full height. I stood up and did the same.</p><p>\u201cNo, and that\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me from doing it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am your mother!\u201d</p><p>Jim opened his mouth. \u201cMengapa?\u201d</p><p>Oh my gods.</p><p>He spoke Indonesian.</p><p>My mother\u2019s eyes went wide and for a second she looked like a furious cat. \u201cHe speaks Indonesian!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me he speaks Indonesian? This is a thing I need to know!\u201d</p><p>I waved my arms. \u201cI didn\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you didn\u2019t know? You just said you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant I didn\u2019t know that he did and then he did and I went \u2018I know!\u2019 because I was surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies!\u201d Jim barked, standing up.</p><p>We both looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re speaking so fast, I can\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy does Dali need to go to the Underground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou explain it to him,\u201d my mother said. \u201cI will make tea.\u201d She went into the kitchen.</p> <p>I pointed at the chair. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>He sat and lowered his voice. \u201cWhat happened to your mother\u2019s accent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re past that now,\u201d I whispered to him. \u201cHer little Asian lady act is just for show. She has a master\u2019s in chemistry from Princeton.\u201d</p><p>Jim blinked.</p><p>\u201cWell, where did you think I got my brains?\u201d</p><p>Jim shook his head. \u201cExplain the Underground thing.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cHow much did you understand? And since when do you speak Indonesian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the idea that something is seriously fucked up and it seemed like an interesting language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting language? Really? So what, you got up one day and said, \u2018Hmm, I think I will learn Bahasa Indonesia today\u2019?\u201d He was up to something.</p><p>A green sheen rolled over Jim\u2019s eyes. \u201cDali, the Underground?\u201d</p><p>There was no easy way to say it. \u201cSomething is feeding on your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>I leaned closer. \u201cAll people generate magic. Some can use it, some can\u2019t; some generate more than others, but all of us are magic engines: We absorb it from the environment and emit it back out. That\u2019s why we can shift during technology: We store enough magic in our bodies to allow us to change shape. Let\u2019s take Kate.\u201d</p><p>Jim\u2019s voice betrayed a quiet warning. \u201cWhat about Kate?\u201d</p><p>Kate used to work with Jim in the Mercenary Guild. Kate was gorgeous, funny, and she could kill anything. I hated her. She could say anything to Jim and he would just needle her back. I was so jealous of her I used to have to leave the room, until I realized that Kate crushed on Curran. She was now mated to him, and since he was the Beast Lord, that made her the Beast Lady and not interested in Jim. Kate and Curran had some seriously rough time with an ancient goddess who blew into town, and now Kate walked with a cane and Curran was barely three weeks out of a coma.</p><p>\u201cEver notice how when Kate gets stressed out the phones stop working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phones are unreliable as a rule,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Kate. She generates so much magic, she short-circuits tech if she isn\u2019t careful. I do the same thing, except I control mine better. She can\u2019t shoot a gun either. I\u2019ve watched her practice and it either goes wide or doesn\u2019t fire at all. And she has no clue. Watch her sometime: She will stomp in, grab the phone, make that growly noise, and walk away. Ten minutes later you can order takeout on the same phone. It\u2019s the funniest thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with my soul being drained?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re magic, Jim. You absorb and consume magic, emanating it into the environment. By doing so, you modify the environment to be more suitable to your existence. It\u2019s like the evolutionary loop: A species is shaped by its environment, because those with the mutations most suitable to the environment survive and reproduce, but a species also modifies its environment to make it more suitable to its survival.\u201d</p><p>Jim sighed. \u201cGive me the short version.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething is interfering with your ability to emanate magic. You absorb and convert it, but then something or someone is siphoning it off. That\u2019s why you feel tired and sleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s feeding off of me?\u201d</p><p>My mother walked in carrying a platter with a teapot and three cups. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jim frowned. \u201cMakes sense. That\u2019s why it didn\u2019t kill me\u2014the more magic I make, the more it eats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize that you\u2019re going to die?\u201d My mother shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got the dying part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found some sort of zombie instead of a man.\u201d My mother pointed at Jim. \u201cLook, he isn\u2019t even concerned.\u201d</p><p>I poured the tea. \u201cHe\u2019s concerned, Mother. He just doesn\u2019t panic, because he\u2019s in charge and if he panics, everybody else will panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can jog around the room pretending to scream if you would like,\u201d Jim offered.</p><p>My mother raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re working so hard to dig your own grave, you might work yourself to death. Simmer down.\u201d</p><p>Jim drew back as if she\u2019d smacked his hand with a ruler.</p><p>\u201cWe have to sever the connection between you and whoever is doing this,\u201d I said before they started slapping each other. \u201cBut we can\u2019t see it. To make it visible we need Keong Emas. It\u2019s a magic snail. There is a legend in Indonesia that talks about a beautiful princess, who was cursed and turned into a snail. The legend is figurative and the snail doesn\u2019t turn into an actual princess, but with the right magic, it will reveal hidden things. The only way to get the snail is to buy it at the Underground. It\u2019s rare and expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney isn\u2019t an issue,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the money, you stupid boy.\u201d Mother set the teacup down. \u201cShe can\u2019t go there because of the yisheng.\u201d</p><p>Jim looked at me.</p><p>\u201cYisheng is the Chinese word for a medicine man,\u201d I said. \u201cThe dealers at the Underground call themselves that, but they aren\u2019t medicine men. They\u2019re animal-parts dealers. Do you remember that big shapeshifter case in Asheville three years ago?\u201d</p><p>Jim frowned. \u201cVaguely. I was in Florida, dealing with Kaja\u2019s loup pack. I remember there was a fifteen-year-old kid, Jarod, I think. He was a black bear. He said he was walking in the woods, encountered a group of hunters, waved to indicate that he was a shapeshifter, and when he turned away, the hunters shot him in the back and he had to defend himself. By the time the game wardens showed up, Jarod had the shooter pinned and everyone else had cleared out. The medic pulled sixteen bullets out of the kid. The hunter claimed he was attacked without provocation. They had a hard time proving Jarod\u2019s story because his wounds had closed, so there was no way to determine how he\u2019d been shot. The prosecution argued that Jarod was so huge in his beast form that if he was walking away from a hunter, no sane man would have shot him, so the hunters must\u2019ve fired in self-defense. Curran sent the entire legal division down there.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, Jim wasn\u2019t sure what the word vaguely meant.</p><p>\u201cMy uncle Aditya testified in that trial,\u201d I told him. \u201cHe is a federal park ranger for the Smoky Mountains National Park. The hunter\u2019s name was Williams. Chad Williams, MD. Uncle Aditya testified that Williams has been detained several times on suspicion of poaching with intent to sell animal parts. He had friends in the right places and he was let go every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid people believe that bear cures everything,\u201d Mother put in. \u201cDiabetes, stomach pain, weak heart, limp penis ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA black bear gallbladder goes for about forty-five thousand dollars on the black market,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jim repeated, \u201cForty-five grand?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWhen your family is sick or your equipment stops working, people get desperate. Especially ignorant white people\u2014they think mystical \u2018Oriental\u2019 medicine will cure all their ills.\u201d</p><p>I refilled our cups. \u201cA black bear\u2019s gallbladder is expensive. A bear shapeshifter\u2019s gallbladder is worth even more. Williams shot Jarod on purpose. He wanted his organs. They found silver bullets hidden in his campsite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoachers think that if the bear dies in pain, his gallbladder will get bigger.\u201d My mother grimaced.</p><p>Jim\u2019s eyes sparked with green. \u201cThey shot the boy with regular bullets to torture him before they killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Once all this stuff came out on the stand, everybody got involved.\u201d I waved my arms. \u201cThe marshals, the FBI, the GBI. Williams even got in trouble with the post office because the idiot used the mail to ship some animal parts down to Atlanta. He went down in flames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd our family got blacklisted with the poachers forever and ever and ever,\u201d my mother said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dali can\u2019t go into the Underground. A black bear is a valuable animal, but you know what\u2019s better?\u201d</p><p>My mother got up, went to the cabinet, and pulled a folded paper out. Oh no. Not again.</p><p>\u201cA tiger!\u201d My mother slapped the paper in front of Jim. On it a stylized tiger curved his back in a garishly bright watercolor. Arrows pointed to different parts of the tiger\u2019s body, each marked with a label: brain to cure laziness and acne, blood to cure weak constitution and gain power, teeth for breathing problems and venereal diseases, whiskers to help with the toothache ...</p><p>Jim stared at it. His eyes went completely green, glowing with barely restrained violence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey will kill her,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s lucky, they will kill her.\u201d Mother crossed her arms.</p><p>Jim looked at her.</p> <p>\u201cWhite tiger, powerful magic. She heals very fast. They\u2019ll put her in a cage and harvest her parts over and over. She\u2019ll be their organ factory. We\u2019ve heard of such things happening. She can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>Jim\u2019s face was terrible. When Curran was angry, he roared. Jim never roared. Jim did this ... this horrible stone-faced thing, where the only indication of life on his face were his eyes. They were hard and furious and full of icy calculation. He scared me when he looked like that. My throat closed up, and I just wanted to sit in the corner and be small.</p><p>Today I didn\u2019t have that luxury. The anxiety sat in my chest. I swallowed. Come on, blind girl. You can do it. \u201cWe need the snail, Mother. He will die without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be another way,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>I shook my head.</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll get it myself,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>\u201cHa! Keong Emas is not some black bear. It\u2019s very rare. They won\u2019t sell it to you,\u201d Mother said.</p><p>I met Jim\u2019s eyes. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. You can\u2019t show up there with an entourage of shapeshifters and force them to sell you the snail. You can\u2019t buy the snail yourself, because they won\u2019t sell to you.\u201d</p><p>Jim opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t get a different shapeshifter to go get it, because the snail looks ordinary, until someone with enough magic touches it, and I\u2019m the only one I can think of with that much magic, besides Kate, and Kate is hobbling around with a cane at the moment, so she can\u2019t go either. And no, you have no choice, Jim, because there is no other way.\u201d</p><p>Jim\u2019s eyes sparked.</p> <p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work either. Even if you put me under guard, I will still get out,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many people you attach to me, I will curse my way out if I have to. I won\u2019t sit here and watch you die.\u201d</p><p>He snarled. I showed him my teeth.</p><p>A rolled-up newspaper landed on my head and then on Jim\u2019s. \u201cNone of that in my house!\u201d</p><p>Oh my gods. The alpha of Clan Cat just got smacked with a rolled-up newspaper. \u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>She pointed at me with the newspaper. \u201cDo not shame me.\u201d</p><p>I clamped my mouth shut. When she pulled out the shame card, it was all over.</p><p>My mother stared at Jim. \u201cYou will go with her tomorrow, when the market opens. You will bring my daughter back to me, unharmed, do you hear? And you better be worth it.\u201d</p><p>Jim held her gaze.</p> <p>If he struck at my mother, I\u2019d strike him back.</p><p>Jim opened his mouth.</p><p>I tensed until it hurt.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Oh phew. Dodged the bullet. Not that I thought he would really strike at my mother, but you just never know.</p><p>\u201cTake him outside, to the tree,\u201d my mother said. \u201cAnd keep him awake until morning. He falls asleep, he dies.\u201d</p><p>THE TREE GREW in the inner yard formed by the backs of two houses on one side and a sturdy stone wall on the others. A long twisty pond took up half of the yard. Pink lotus blossoms and yellow lilies thrust from the dark water, flanked by the round leaves. In the middle of the pound, a statue of Lakshmi rose, surrounded by shrinking violets in orange glazed pots and linked to the shore by dark stepping-stones. Philodendrons bordered the pond, fighting for space with bamboo and ferns. Gold bird of paradise plants bloomed here and there. To the left a bunut tree rose with a small teak bench beside it. A bucket and ladle waited by the trunk.</p><p>I led Jim to the bench. \u201cSit here.\u201d</p><p>He sat.</p><p>I dipped the bucket into the pond, set it between us, and sat on the low stone wall of a flower bed.</p><p>He looked around. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice garden.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI like it. It quiet and beautiful. Most Indonesians are Muslim, but we\u2019re Hindu. A place for meditation is important to us. The tree you\u2019re sitting under came from the seed of a very special holy tree in Bali, the Bunut Bolog tree. It\u2019s a type of fig. The Bunut Bolog tree is so large and so powerful that it is like a forest by itself. It has a hole at its base, and the hole is so wide, there is a two-lane road running through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did they build a road through the sacred tree?\u201d Jim asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was too dangerous to go around it because of the cliffs. They thought about cutting the tree down, but the spirits of the tree\u2019s guardians refused to allow it, so they just had to make the best of it. It\u2019s not wise to piss off the tree\u2019s guardians. They are ferocious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of guardians?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a little smile. \u201cTigers.\u201d</p><p>Jim grinned. \u201cTigers, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. His face was calm and I wanted to kiss him. I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cYou looked worried after that newspaper thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for that. I didn\u2019t mean to make you\u2014\u201d</p><p>If he said \u201cscared,\u201d I would make him wear this damn bucket on his head. Vegetarian and half blind, I was still a shapeshifter, a predator. I had my pride.</p><p>\u201c\u2014upset.\u201d</p><p>Hmm, upset I could probably live with. He didn\u2019t need to know that. \u201cI wasn\u2019t upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is, I would never hurt you or your family.\u201d</p><p>I raised my chin at him. \u201cIf you tried to hurt my mother, I would totally kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You would be lying on the ground, crying, \u2018No more, no more,\u2019 and I would be kicking you in the stomach, wham, wham, wham!\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. He was so terribly handsome. Here we were sitting two feet from each other, and we might as well be on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do this,\u201d Jim said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go there, I don\u2019t want you to get hurt trying to help me. It\u2019s not your job to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, tomorrow I\u2019ll go in there myself, and if I choke somebody long enough, they will bring the snail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha. And how do you plan on determining if they\u2019ve brought a garden snail or a golden one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll spray somebody\u2019s magic blood around until the snail lights up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d I dipped my ladle into the bucket and tossed the water at him.</p><p>He recoiled. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re delirious from lack of sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDali!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poachers are smart and a lot of them have magic. Some of them can tell what kind of a shapeshifter you are from a hundred yards just by looking at you. If you go to the Underground tomorrow, you will fall asleep there, alone and helpless, and then the poachers will kill you and cut you into tiny pieces, and then your precious werejaguar bones will be sliced into thin wafers and put into wine, so some sicko can have magic powers in bed.\u201d</p><p>He let out a frustrated snarl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just like with the tea\u2014somebody offers you a gift, and you turn up your nose at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking chances again. I won\u2019t let you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute of you to think you can stop me, Jim. Usually you order me around and I do what you say. I might gripe and I might make a fuss, but I will do it, because you are my alpha and I respect you. On this, you get no respect. You know nothing about this world. Your rules don\u2019t apply here, but mine do. You will follow my lead and you will let me save you, Jim.\u201d Because thinking about you dying makes me hurt.</p><p>He opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIf it was the other way around, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your alpha. It\u2019s my job to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt goes both ways,\u201d I said.</p><p>He rubbed his hands over his eyes. I tossed another ladleful of water at him.</p><p>\u201cQuit it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked sleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy, I\u2019m at the end of my patience with this stupid hocus-pocus shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Fine. He could be dense and pissed off all he wanted, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>We sat in silence. Off to the side night insects chirped and seesawed sad little songs. Tomorrow would suck. It would suck so much, and we didn\u2019t even know what was wrong with him. I wished the markets would be open already so we could get it done before he fell asleep again.</p><p>\u201cDo you at least have a plan?\u201d Jim asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Most likely we\u2019ll have to get down to Kenny\u2019s Alley in the Underground. That\u2019s where the most expensive animal parts are sold. I will go inside the shop. You will wait outside. I will offer them a lot of money for the snail. If I get in trouble, I\u2019ll scream and you will get me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hell of a plan.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I fail to bring you back unharmed, your mother will skin me alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might just turn you inside out.\u201d</p><p>Jim had this funny long-suffering look on his face, and then his eyes sparked. \u201cSo does she grill every guy you bring home?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bring guys home, you stupid, stupid man. \u201cIgnore it. She\u2019s just worried. I\u2019m almost thirty and still unmarried. It\u2019s a big deal in my culture.\u201d Not that he would understand.</p><p>\u201cI like it how wealthy trumped black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim, ignore it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He raised his hands up.</p><p>Gah. \u201cShe\u2019s desperate, all right? She just wants me to be happy, and she\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll never make a good match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Oh my gods. \u201cWhat do you mean, why? Jim, look at me.\u201d</p><p>He did. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>What, now I had to spell it out? Talk about humiliating. \u201cMy mother tried to describe me in a glowing light: She went through all my virtues.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got that,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially the part about obedient and respectful ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind that. She went through the whole list. If I could do origami, she would\u2019ve mentioned it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, and?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid she tell you I was pretty?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a blank look.</p><p>\u201cDid the word pretty come out of her mouth? At all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d Happy now?</p> <p>\u201cSo this is it? This is your big hang-up? You\u2019re pissed off because your mother doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re pretty? Don\u2019t let it bother you. It\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>Oh, you idiot. It\u2019s not my mother I\u2019m worried about. It\u2019s you. I waved my arms. \u201cJim, what\u2019s the first thing you said to me when I asked you to describe the strange woman? Let me help you remember: You said she was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you didn\u2019t notice what she was wearing on her feet, but you noticed how hot she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was barefoot and her feet were dirty.\u201d</p><p>Him and his stupid memory. \u201cThat\u2019s how it goes: Men are supposed to be strong, women are supposed to be beautiful. Well, I\u2019m not beautiful. You can put me into a room of a hundred women my age, and I\u2019ll be smarter than most of them put together, but it won\u2019t make a damn bit of difference, because if you let a man into that same room and let him pick, I would be the last one left. If I were a normal woman, I could use my brain to earn money and then I would get plastic surgery. I would fix my nose, and then I would work some more until I could afford to fix my jaw and so on and so on, until I was pretty. But I\u2019m not a normal woman. Lyc-V won\u2019t fix my eyes, but it will undo any surgery. I know, I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019m stuck this way and there\u2019s not a damn thing I can do about it. And you say, \u2018Don\u2019t let it bother you,\u2019 as if that\u2019s supposed to make everything go away!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if the surgery did work, when would you stop having it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen I walked into the room, and men turned their heads to look at me. I want to be beautiful. I want to be a knockout. I would trade all of my intelligence and all of my mystic tiger magic for that.\u201d</p><p>The green glow backlit his irises. \u201cAnd be what? A pretty idiot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cNadene is pretty,\u201d he growled. \u201cBeautiful woman. Dumb as a board. She can\u2019t keep a guy longer than a couple of months. Phillip left her and she wanted me to intervene so I went to talk to him. He told me that she was fun to fuck for a while, but being with her made him feel like he was getting dumber. They couldn\u2019t have a normal conversation. He couldn\u2019t handle it. And you want to be that? Are you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even notice the fact that I am female, Jim! I\u2019m just a brain with a pair of glasses that you occasionally have to put under guard so it\u2019s not damaged trying to have a little bit of fun. Did you ever ask yourself why I race?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know why you race,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou race because you have a chip on your shoulder the size of a two-by-four. You think that because it takes you two minutes to come to when you shift and because you\u2019re not the best fighter we\u2019ve got, you have something to prove. And you do this by making metal cages with four wheels go really fast without any point. You don\u2019t win anything, you don\u2019t accomplish anything, and you hurt yourself all the time. You\u2019re right\u2014that will show everyone how hard-core you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAargh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing you\u2019re proving is that the smartest woman I know has zero common sense. You have powerful magic, you\u2019re smart, you\u2019re competent, but none of that matters. I have a dozen Nadenes, I only have one you. What good would Nadene do me right now? And I know you\u2019re female. I\u2019ve noticed. This hysterical thing you\u2019re doing right now, that\u2019s female. If you were a man, I would\u2019ve put your ass to haul rocks for the Keep a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>I heaved up the bucket.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d he warned.</p><p>I hurled it at him, water and all. Water splashed, and then a completely drenched, pissed-off Jim grabbed the bucket, scooped water from the pond, and tossed it at me. Water hit me in a cold rush.</p><p>I turned around and stomped off.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cAway from you!\u201d I sat on the bench at the far end of the pond.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to keep me awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can keep you awake from here. If I see you falling asleep, I\u2019ll curse you with something really painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that. You\u2019re still wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>THE MORNING CAME way too slow. Jim had almost dozed off four times and I ended up moving next to him, with my bucket. At some point he asked me if my girly emotional outbursts were over, and I swore at him for a while in Indonesian. And then he ruined it by asking me what some of the words meant, and of course I had to teach him how to pronounce them properly.</p><p>It\u2019s good that my mother stayed inside, or I would have gotten another lecture on how to behave as a proper daughter.</p><p>It was seven o\u2019clock now and we were standing on Pryor Street, in front of a grimy white arch marking the entrance to Kenny\u2019s Alley. Set apart from the main Underground, Kenny\u2019s Alley had no roof, and entering through the narrow ramp off of Pryor Street was the quickest way to get there. It was also the most dangerous\u2014to get down, I\u2019d have to walk up the narrow ramp that squeezed between two brick buildings, enter the old train depot, and then walk along the balcony and down two floors, all filled with people who\u2019d kill me for a dollar. Sometimes people who entered the Underground through Pryor Street didn\u2019t come out.</p><p>The wind swirled, rushing down the narrow gap between the buildings, and flung the Underground\u2019s scents into my face: odors of a dozen of animal species mixed with the bitter stink of stale urine, human and otherwise, old manure, fish from a giant fishmonger tank, pungent incense, and salty blood. The revolting amalgam washed over me and I had to fight not to retch.</p><p>At least the magic had vanished during the night. Usually the miasma rising from the Underground made my head hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and put his arm around me. I froze. There was so much strength in that muscular arm that suddenly I felt safe. The scent of him, the comforting, strong Jim scent, touched me, blocking out other smells. I would know that scent anywhere. Here he was hugging me. I had wished for it and now I just wanted to cry, because no matter what I did, no matter how much I raced or how belligerent I got, he would never want me. Not in that way.</p><p>I stepped away from him, before I lost it. \u201cI\u2019m going inside. If I go inside a shop, give me about five minutes. If I don\u2019t come out ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come in,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I looked into his brown eyes and believed him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019m going now.\u201d</p><p>I turned and headed down the narrow alley, into the dark belly of the Underground. Panhandlers and street people lined the ramp and the balcony, swaddled in filthy clothes, hats and tins in front of them. This early in the morning they didn\u2019t even bother begging. They just stared at me as I passed by, all except an old black man, who was doing a wobbly moonwalk across a covered walkway, gyrating to the beat of some melody only he could hear. His eyes were wide-open; he looked straight at me but didn\u2019t see me.</p><p>The ramp led me up to the top floor, to a wide balcony. Kenny\u2019s Alley stretched below: a dank narrow space, filled with stalls and vicious-eyed people, its brick floor barely visible beneath cages and refuse. I kept walking. The balcony ended and I took the stairs down to the lower floor, where vendors hawked their wares. Dull electric lamps were strung out between old Christmas lights, marking the little shops. Despite the hour, customers already flooded the market, men, women, and children of every color and race looking for the magic cure to their problems. They were what allowed the poachers to exist. They\u2019d stop poaching if people stopped buying.</p><p>What I needed wouldn\u2019t be sold here. I had to get to Kenny\u2019s Alley.</p><p>The electric lamps blinked and died. Darkness clenched the Underground in its mouth and spat it out with the hiss and crackle of magic. Fey lanterns ignited with a pale blue glow, their thin glass tubes twisted into kanji and familiar shapes: phoenix, tiger, dragon. Magic flowed and twisted around me. Here and there, wards shielded the storefronts, strong, solid. To the left a wavering miasma of something foul and wrong leaked from behind a closed door. Straight ahead, a stall of small coin charms radiated something pleasant, almost warm.</p><p>Another magic wave. There shouldn\u2019t have been one. Nobody could predict when magic came and went, but it rarely flooded the city twice in twenty-four hours. Just my luck.</p><p>I kept moving, winding my way between the stalls. If Jim was following me, I couldn\u2019t see him. I hoped he stayed awake. I hoped he would with all my might, because if he fell asleep, there was no hope for either of us.</p><p>The entrance to Kenny\u2019s Alley loomed ahead, a rectangle of weak sunrise light. The smell hit me first, that unforgettable stench of too many animals kept too close together. Then came the noise: the braying, the mewing, the snarls. I stepped out into the open. Three-story houses rose on both sides of me, boxing in a narrow alley. Stalls and tables lined the front of the shops, offering dried ox penises, tanks containing geoduck mollusks, deer antlers, bundles of dried herbs. To the left a man dipped steel tongs into a box and plucked out a black poisonous centipede. The insect writhed, trying to break free. The man took the lid off a pot on the kerosene burner and tossed the centipede inside.</p><p>Small-time. I kept walking. I needed a rare-goods dealer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>People were looking at me. From the shop front on the right a middle-aged white woman in camo fabric stared at my legs, then at my head, as if she wanted to shoot me. Magic probed me, teasing, testing. A couple of younger men, probably Chinese, leaned to each other, whispering. I caught bits and pieces. A word stood out: hu. Tiger. Didn\u2019t take them long to see through my human form.</p><p>I felt like a cow being led past a row of butcher shops. I raised my chin. Show no fear, or they will swoop like vultures.</p><p>A stall to the left looked richer than the rest: The table was sturdy and the cloth on it was red silk, the real thing, not a cheap imitation. An old wizened woman, Korean by her dress, sat guarding the wares, looking bored. I stopped and looked at the dried-out parts displayed on the silk.</p> <p>I bowed. \u201cAn-nyung-ha-se-yo.\u201d Hello.</p><p>The woman bowed her head back. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>English. Great. My Korean was rusty.</p><p>I paused by a small white sack that lay half open. Inside lay minced leather strips.</p><p>\u201cBear gallbladder,\u201d the woman said.</p> <p>I picked up a small slice and sniffed it. \u201cPig.\u201d If it had been a real bear gallbladder, she wouldn\u2019t have let me pick it up. \u201cDo you have bear?\u201d</p><p>The woman reached under the table, pulled out a small wooden box, and opened it. Dried leathery strips. Could be bear gallbladder.</p><p>The woman snapped the box closed. \u201cWhen were you born? What is your sign? You have nice pale skin, but the eyes are not so good, yes? We have snake glands for the eyes. Dried cicadas, make it into soup, it will make your eyes stronger. Or does your man need help in bed? I have something very special for that. Not like all those dried-out dog parts over there.\u201d She grimaced at the stall across the street. \u201cI have a sure thing. Want to see?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Another box appeared as if by magic. I looked inside. Rhino horn. The genuine article, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a rare thing.\u201d</p> <p>The woman pondered me. \u201cHow rare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery rare. Keong Emas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Golden Snail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will pay well.\u201d I reached into my hoodie and showed her the money, just a hint, but it was enough.</p><p>\u201cKeong Emas is powerful magic.\u201d The old woman stared at me. Her eyes were cold like two pieces of coal.</p><p>\u201cMakes it easy to recognize a fake,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She let out a short little grunt and called out something in Korean, too fast to follow. \u201cYou go inside now.\u201d</p><p>I stepped over a small crate containing a pair of frightened rabbits, and went inside. Cages lined the walls. Monkeys, dogs, birds. Big frightened eyes. They screamed and shied away from the bars at my approach. I clenched my teeth. I just had to get the snail. Just get the snail.</p> <p>An adolescent boy came through the curtained doorway and waved to me. \u201cCome this way.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go that way.</p><p>The boy waved at me. \u201cCome! Come!\u201d</p><p>Crap. I followed him through the curtain. A long dark room smelling of blood. Great. We kept going, farther from the street, deeper into the house. I was probably walking into a trap, but I had to get the snail. This was the only way. As long as Jim stayed awake, he would get me out. He would. Of course he would.</p><p>Another set of curtains and I stepped into a large room lined with tables, supporting a medicine man\u2019s smorgasbord, as if a dozen street vendor carts had vomited their contents into the room. Boxes, wicker, wood, and plastic. Bloated glass bottles, skinny glass vials, jars containing powders and liquids. Dried herbs, in bundles and packets. And bones. So many bones: bear bones, wolf bones, tiger bones. Bastards.</p><p>An Asian man sat at the table, wizened and old, dressed in dark clothes. Behind him a white man leaned against the wall. He was tall and beefy, and his fatigue jacket made him look rectangular, like he was made out of bricks. A short reddish beard hugged his chin. A red NC State baseball cap covered his hair.</p><p>In the right corner a large cage sat covered by a tarp. A blond woman stood by it, leaning on a baseball bat. She wore jeans and a huge man\u2019s T-shirt with an oversized blood drop and the words DONATE BLOOD on it. The T-shirt was threadbare and patched in a couple of places.</p><p>Something moved in the cage. I could hear it breathing in long, labored gasps. People moved in the outer rooms, too, to the right of us and behind, making small noises. A lot of people. At least eight, maybe more.</p><p>I just had to get the snail. That\u2019s all. Just get the snail and save Jim.</p><p>The old man regarded me. I wouldn\u2019t bow to this asshole. My back would break.</p><p>\u201cYou want to buy Keong Emas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The boy who brought me here walked over to the far table and brought a wicker box to the old man. The man opened the box and removed a glass tank with five snails inside. Each had a dull brown shell.</p><p>The old man offered me the tank. \u201cChoose one.\u201d</p><p>This was it.</p><p>I reached into the tank and passed my hand over the snails. The smallest one tugged on me, tiny needles of magic prickling my skin. Gently, I plucked it from its leaf and held it in the palm of my hand.</p><p>A faint glow lit the snail from within. It lingered for a second and burst, painting the snail\u2019s shell with brilliant gold.</p><p>\u201cOnly powerful magic can see Keong Emas,\u201d the old man said. \u201cWhite tiger magic.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. I clamped the snail in my hand and felt it slide into its shell. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake her.\u201d The old man nodded to the guy in the red hat.</p><p>Red Hat peeled himself from the wall. Behind me a man and a woman moved from behind the curtain, cutting off my exit.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here,\u201d the old man said.</p><p>\u201cJim!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t help,\u201d the old man said. \u201cNobody will help.\u201d</p><p>I dashed left, but Red Hat\u2019s hand gripped my shoulder and he jerked me off my feet with superhuman strength. I kicked at him, but he batted my legs aside and carried me back to the corner, where a woman pulled the tarp off the cage. A man knelt in the cage on all fours, filthy, wearing rags smeared with old blood. Plastic ties forced his wrists together, and above them a ragged cloth with a holding spell scrawled in ink bound his forearms. A leather muzzle clamped his whole face, leaving only the narrow strip of space around his eyes visible. Bandages hid his head and all I saw was one eye, mad, furious, and brilliant turquoise.</p><p>There was a second cage next to him. An empty cage.</p><p>Panic squirmed through me. I kicked and thrashed, but the cage kept coming closer and closer. If I went tiger, he couldn\u2019t carry me, but I\u2019d be too dazed to fight and I would drop the snail. I couldn\u2019t drop the snail, or Jim would die.</p><p>Jim would come for me. He wouldn\u2019t fall asleep. He wouldn\u2019t let them kill him.</p><p>I kicked and jerked with all the shapeshifter strength I had.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make this harder on yourself,\u201d Red Hat told me.</p><p>We were almost to the cage. \u201cHow can you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour uncle kept a lot of people from feeding their families.\u201d Red Hat shoved me the final five feet. \u201cWe have mouths to feed. I don\u2019t have a problem doing this.\u201d</p><p>I thrust my legs at the cage and braced myself. \u201cJim! Come get me!\u201d</p><p>The man in the other cage moaned a wordless scream and rammed the bars.</p><p>Red Hat jerked me down. \u201cNobody\u2019s coming for you.\u201d</p><p>No! No, I will not be put into a fucking cage. I kicked against the cage, pitching myself backward. My head smashed into Red Hat\u2019s face. He dropped me. My feet touched the ground. Yes! I scrambled left.</p><p>Something smashed against my temple. Pain exploded between my ears. I spun. The woman behind me swung again and the bat took me straight in the face. The world shivered and I tasted blood on my lips.</p><p>Red Hat clamped me and muscled me forward. The man in the other cage let out a long desperate wail.</p><p>It was over. Jim fell asleep. Nobody was coming for me.</p><p>RED HAT WAS dragging me to the cage. The blond woman leaned over and swung open the door.</p><p>A man flew through the curtain and slid across the floor, knocking the tables and benches out of the way until he hit the wall. I caught a glimpse of long dark hair. He clenched his hands to his throat. A thin red spray shot from between his fingers. He gurgled, his eyes huge with sharp fear.</p><p>The curtain fell, revealing Jim, drenched in blood. His eyes glowed green and his face was terrible.</p><p>He came! Oh my gods, he came for me. It was going to be okay. Everything was going to be okay.</p><p>A stocky man lunged at Jim from the left, swinging a machete. Jim grabbed him. His knife flashed, and the man crumpled down, his machete slick with his own blood.</p><p>Red Hat threw me aside. I crashed into the cage and thrust the snail into the pocket of my jeans.</p><p>The blond woman by the cage screamed and swung her baseball bat at me. I ripped it out of her hands and bashed her with it. The bat snapped with a sharp wooden crunch. The blow knocked the woman across the room. That\u2019s right, fuck you!</p><p>A man fired a crossbow at Jim. Jim swayed out of the way, leapt, clearing the tables, and struck. The crossbowman fell like a lifeless doll. More people streamed from the back doorway.</p><p>Jim looked at me and smiled.</p><p>Red Hat shrugged his jacket off. A dark pattern swirled along his skin, like the whorls of wood grain. He headed toward Jim. A table got in his way, and he knocked it out of the way. The table splintered. Oh shit.</p><p>In the corner the old man waved his arms. Angry magic streaked through the air.</p><p>Jim was cutting his way toward me, his knife sending arcs of blood left and right. People screamed, wood crashed, Jim snarled. The scent of blood made me dizzy.</p><p>The prisoner moaned at me. The empty cage blocked his door. I pushed it. It didn\u2019t move. I wedged myself between the wall and the cage, planting my feet on its base, and pushed, pushed as hard as I could. Wood creaked, and the cage slid out of the way. I dropped to my knees. A long knotted cord bound the door, the knots holding coins. I grabbed it. Magic scorched my fingers and I jerked back, wincing.</p><p>The prisoner screamed, hitting the bars.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. I can do this. Just hold on one second.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Red Hat smashed into Jim.</p><p>Everything slowed down as if we were all underwater.</p><p>Jim\u2019s knife sliced, across, down, across the other way, still so fast, like lightning. The blade glanced off Red Hat\u2019s new wooden skin. Red Hat bared his teeth and swung his giant fist. Jim leaned out of the way, lean and graceful, and thrust. The knife bit deep into Red Hat\u2019s left eye. The big man bellowed like a bull.</p> <p>Jim vaulted over him.</p><p>The caged man moaned. I\u2019d need a week to figure how to break the seal without hurting myself. I didn\u2019t have a week.</p><p>Outside the window people screamed. More poachers coming in.</p><p>I grabbed the magic cord and jerked. It broke, leaving dark stripes of burned flesh across my hands. Pain lashed me, but I was too busy. I jerked the door open, grabbed the man by his shoulders, and pulled him out of there. He crashed on his side.</p><p>A hand caught my shoulder and pulled me up. \u201cTime to go,\u201d Jim breathed.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I pointed to the prisoner. \u201cI can\u2019t leave him. Help me.\u201d</p><p>Red Hat spun toward us, screaming, the knife still in the socket of his eye.</p><p>Jim cut, once, twice, and the prisoner\u2019s hands came free. Another cut took the mask from his head, and I stared at the face of the most stunning Asian man I had ever seen. He was like a celestial being from a Chinese watercolor\u2014absolutely flawless.</p><p>The eyes of purest turquoise stared at me and within their depth I saw a spiral of fire.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>The prisoner surged to his feet. Magic unfurled from him like a mantle in splashes of red and gold, forming the translucent outline of a scaled beast on four sturdy muscled legs.</p> <p>Jim pushed me behind him and raised his knife.</p><p>Transparent claws the size of my hands dug into the wood. The head of a dragon formed upon the massive shoulders. The prisoner stood within the beast, still clearly visible. His hair had broken free of the bandages and it streamed down his back in a long dark wave.</p><p>Red Hat froze in midstep.</p><p>The old man howled a curse and clawed the air. A serpent of bright crimson launched itself from his fingers and bit at the translucent beast. The prisoner waved his arm, and the serpent sparked and melted into ash.</p><p>A Suanmi.</p><p>People burst through the door.</p><p>The Suanmi looked at them. The magic beast\u2019s maw gaped open.</p><p>Red Hat turned and started running.</p> <p>Fire burst from the beast\u2019s mouth, roaring like an enraged animal. It caught the old man first, jerked him upright, and swept by, leaving a charred ruin of a body. The smoking corpse took two steps toward us and fell.</p><p>Jim clamped me to him, trying to shield me.</p><p>The men at the door scrambled to get out, but the fire fanned hot, all-powerful. Screams filled my ears. I shut my eyes and stuck my face into Jim\u2019s chest.</p><p>The screaming went on forever.</p><p>Finally the roar stopped. I pulled my head away from Jim.</p><p>The man within the dragon turned and looked at us. Jim growled, and his clothes exploded off his body. His skin ripped, releasing muscle underneath. Bones thrust, growing, muscle formed new powerful limbs, and a new skin sheathed it, showing the coils of black rosettes against a thin golden pelt. A new creature stood in Jim\u2019s place: half man, half monster. A werejaguar in the warrior form.</p><p>Jim snarled, his black lips framing enormous fangs, and stepped between me and the prisoner.</p><p>The Suanmi opened his mouth. Words flowed in English. \u201cThere is no need to fear me.\u201d</p><p>There was every need to fear him. He had dragon blood in his veins. I swallowed. \u201cWe mean no harm to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The Suanmi looked at the cage. \u201cI\u2019d come here, sick and helpless. My family had been slaughtered and I was hurt. I came looking for medicine, but I lost consciousness and I awoke here. Nine months. I spent my eighteenth birthday in this cage while they carved pieces of my body to make themselves stronger. Healing the damage and waiting to be cut again. Nine months. Felt like forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a bad dream,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt\u2019s over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, yes.\u201d The man smiled. The transparent beast stretched his maw, mimicking the smile, baring enormous teeth. \u201cFor them, the nightmare is only beginning.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a part of their nightmare. May we go?\u201d</p><p>The Suanmi bowed his head, his turquoise eyes fixed on my face. \u201cI owe you a debt, White Tiger.\u201d</p><p>I bowed back. Just let me and Jim go and we\u2019ll call it even.</p><p>\u201cWhen you wish to collect it, come here,\u201d the Suanmi said. \u201cIt is my place now. I will take it from them by midday and by evening they will be bringing gifts to their new emperor.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked away, deeper into the house.</p><p>Jim picked me up and took off running. I hugged his neck and then we were out in the courtyard. Around us people ran in panic. Smoke and fire billowed from the buildings.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Jim growled, his words distorted by his huge mouth.</p><p>\u201cA Suanmi. In Chinese legends the dragon had nine sons, each with their own powers. Turns out the nine sons gave rise to nine families. He is a descendant of the son who wields fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s part dragon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s part dragon. If he looks at you like that again, I\u2019ll cut his face off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he look at me?\u201d</p><p>Jim leapt up the stairs and stopped almost in midstep.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d</p><p>He pointed at the vendor\u2019s cart filled with reproductions of old Japanese pornography. \u201cThe scroll with the woman in red.\u201d</p><p>On the fake scroll, the woman lay on the floor, her red kimono falling apart while a man with a huge mutant penis crouched over her. A string of kanji characters explained the scene. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first two characters in the second column, that\u2019s what I saw on the floor in the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>He lowered me to the ground. I leaned toward the scroll. The first character, second column: Joro. Joro? Really? \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim, that\u2019s a very old word for whore. Baita is more common. I\u2019ve never even seen joro on a sign anywhere, it\u2019s that obscure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I saw.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what that meant. How would August even know that kanji? He could barely remember the word for bathroom.</p><p>Behind us someone roared and a burning wood beam crashed down, just like in an old movie. Jim took my hand, and we ran up the stairs, out of Underground Atlanta, and we didn\u2019t stop running until the door of my mother\u2019s house loomed before me.</p><p>AS SOON AS we walked through the door, my family mugged us. My mother had called an emergency. Everyone was there: uncles, aunts, cousins, neighbors. They pulled Jim away from me and took him to the garden. I tried to follow, but my mother stopped me.</p><p>\u201cDo you have it?\u201d</p><p>I dug in my pocket and deposited the snail into her hand. She held up the shell to light. \u201cAlive. Good!\u201d She swept to the corner of the room, where a glass box held the delicate white stars of the jasmine blossoms. She gently deposited the snail onto the snowy petals and shut the box.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSix hours, if we\u2019re lucky. Ten, if we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>People fussed over me and asked me questions, and then I had to explain that the poacher market was no more. Then I was pushed into the kitchen and made to eat. There were so many dishes that the counter had no space. In my family, any emergency was met with an avalanche of food; the more dire the problem, the bigger the spread.</p><p>Over an hour later, I finally snuck away to steal a look at the Keong Emas. The snail had fed on jasmine. Its shell lay discarded and the fat body of the insect glowed with weak golden radiance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going well,\u201d my mother said. \u201cSo far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Komatsu Grocery to see August\u2019s family. I want to know what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p><p>My mother pursed her lips. I knew what she was thinking. Of all the nationalities I have come across, the Japanese were usually hardest to talk to. They were always polite to a fault, but they didn\u2019t speak to police and they didn\u2019t speak to foreigners. Family matters were kept private and problems were resolved behind closed doors, so no undue attention would be drawn to the family.</p><p>\u201cA waste of time,\u201d Mother said.</p><p>\u201cI have a plan.\u201d</p><p>My mother clamped her hand to her chest, pretending to be scared. \u201cDali, do not make Komatsu Grocery explode. Where will I shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>My mother rolled her eyes to the heavens with a look of uttermost suffering. I growled and went off to find my alpha.</p><p>By the time I fought my way through my relatives to the garden, Jim was human again and very naked. He was seated by the tree and the four older women were pouring spelled water over him, trying to purify the body.</p><p>His gaze found me, dark eyes pleading for help. I walked over to him, trying not to ogle.</p><p>\u201cHelp,\u201d he said.</p><p>I took his hand and held it. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to keep the evil out, until my mother can get the snail to hatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnails don\u2019t hatch,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis one does. Stay awake until I come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to do something. Nothing dangerous. I\u2019ll be back soon, okay? Don\u2019t worry, my family will take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>The hard alpha mask snapped onto Jim\u2019s face. \u201cI look worried to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t kill any of my relatives while I\u2019m gone either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I walked away.</p><p>If you deny a cat information, it will nag at him. If the cat happens to be a spymaster, it will drive him completely crazy. It would keep him awake. Besides, after his lecture on how I was smart but stupid and had a chip on my shoulder, I was allowed a little payback. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>IT WAS ALMOST noon by the time I made it to South Asia. It was a grand name for a small spot in southern Atlanta, where the Asian-themed shops aggregated in a large plaza formed by an old mall. I stopped there a couple of times a month\u2014it was the closest place to buy manga. Also, Komatsu Grocery was hands down the best Asian market in the area. They had a large selection and their seaweed salad was delicious. Whenever I went, I\u2019d buy a two-pound tub of it and then pig out as soon as I got home.</p><p>I parked Pooki on a remote street, stepped out of my car, and stripped off my clothes.</p><p>There was a thing that August\u2019s family would dislike even more than having to speak to outsiders. They would go to great lengths to avoid attracting attention. And I was about to Cause a Scene.</p><p>My panties were off. I crouched and scratched a name in the pavement with the car key: Jim. Next I put my glasses on the passenger\u2019s seat, locked the car, dropped the keys behind the left wheel, and took a deep breath.</p> <p>The world dissolved, swirling into a thousand bokeh, blurry little lights in every color of the rainbow.</p><p>Pretty colors.</p><p>Ooooh, so pretty.</p><p>Mmm, pretty, pretty.</p><p>So many scents. I liked that one, and this one, and this other one was kind of disgusting, and this one made me hungry.</p> <p>I licked my lips. Mmm. Yummy smell, so good.</p><p>The bokeh slowly came into focus: I was lying in a street. Hmmm. I knew this street. This was South Asia.</p><p>Why was I here?</p><p>I looked down. On the pavement in front of me, right between my two paws, was a single word: Jim.</p><p>Jim. My handsome, awesome, scary Jim. Rawr. I smiled and sniffed the name. It didn\u2019t smell like Jim.</p><p>A memory popped in my head like a soap bubble bursting: Jim, dying, soul siphoned, Keong Emas, poachers, August. I came here to find out why August had disappeared for twenty-four hours.</p> <p>I rose and padded around the corner. The magic was still up and when the light caught my fur, every hair gleamed. People stopped and stared. They knew who I was; I had come to South Asia before many times. They knew my magic, too, because it rolled off me with every step.</p><p>I walked over to the door of Komatsu Grocery and lay down in the middle of the street, staring at the door.</p><p>People looked at me, shocked.</p><p>I gave them a nice big smile. That\u2019s right, look what big teeth I have. I knew I was a vegetarian, but aside from Jim and a few friends, nobody else did. Besides, just because I didn\u2019t eat meat, didn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t bite.</p><p>The few people aiming for the store decided they had better places to be.</p><p>After fifteen minutes August\u2019s second cousin, who liked to call herself Jackie, stuck her head out the door. I released my claws and stretched, making long scratches on the pavement. She gulped and ducked back in.</p><p>I could just imagine the conversation inside: \u201cShe\u2019s lying in front of our store!\u201d \u201cIn front of our store? In the street where everyone can see?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Minutes passed by. A little blue butterfly landed on my nose. I blinked at it and it fluttered to my ear. A big yellow butterfly gently floated over and landed on my paw. Soon a whole swarm of them floated up and down around me, like a swirl of multicolored petals. It happened in my backyard, too, if the magic was strong enough. Butterflies were small and light, and very magic sensitive. For some reason I made them feel safe and they gravitated to me like iron shavings to a magnet. They ruined my ferocious badass image, but you\u2019d have to be a complete beast to swat butterflies.</p> <p>If a baby deer frolicked out from between the buildings trying to cuddle up, I would roar. I wouldn\u2019t bite it, but I would roar. I had my limits.</p><p>I flicked my tail. Hmm, a half hour had passed and we were getting close to the forty-five-minute mark. The family was trying to save face or having an argument, but if nobody came to say hello in the next few minutes, their behavior would be edging on rude. One can\u2019t ignore a mystic white tiger on their doorstep. It just wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>The door opened and August\u2019s auntie bowed and held it open. \u201cPlease, come in.\u201d</p><p>I trotted inside, leaving my Lepidoptera entourage outside. August\u2019s auntie led me past the counter to the back room, where August\u2019s grandmother, his uncle, and his mother sat. The entire Komatsu family with the exception of the children and August\u2019s white father. Their faces looked ashen.</p><p>I sat, curling my tail around me.</p><p>We looked at one another.</p><p>\u201cWe know why you are here,\u201d August\u2019s uncle said. Mr. Komatsu was a solemn-looking man in the best of times; now his expression was so grave, he could\u2019ve been carved out of stone.</p><p>I waited.</p><p>\u201cAugust is dead,\u201d he said.</p><p>I sighed. August was the first male son in his generation. The one who would be forgiven every wrong and permitted every privilege, because years later, when his father and uncle were old, he would assume the burden of taking care of Komatsu family. It was a terrible loss for the family.</p><p>\u201cWe have buried his body. It is our affair,\u201d Mr. Komatsu said.</p><p>I shook my head slowly. August was a shapeshifter and other shapeshifters died because of him. It was our affair now.</p><p>Mr. Komatsu stared straight ahead.</p><p>The grandmother leaned forward. \u201cIt\u2019s the woman. Her name is Hiromi. We do not know her family name. It happened seven years ago, just before the flare.\u201d</p><p>The flare came every seven years. If a normal magic fluctuation was a wave, the flare was a tsunami. Bad magic happened during the flare. It dissipated after three days or so, but those three days were terrible. The flare before last dumped a phoenix onto the city, right over the Asian neighborhoods. We had another flare this year and I made my family go to the Keep to stay safe.</p><p>\u201cThe bad magic was coming,\u201d August\u2019s mother said. \u201cPeople boarded up their houses and flooded the stores to get supplies. Everyone was in a rush. Hiromi came in to buy groceries. I\u2019d seen her before a few times. She looked poor. Her clothes were bad and she was thin. Very skinny. She had her daughter with her, a small little girl. She might have been two or three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe child liked cookies,\u201d Mr. Komatsu said. \u201cWe offered some to her every time. Hiromi would only let her have one. Very proud.\u201d</p><p>August\u2019s mother took a deep breath. \u201cHiromi bought her groceries and went out, carrying her little girl. A street person stabbed them outside the door. We found him later. He was a crazed old man. The flare had made him insane. He didn\u2019t even remember doing it. He just stabbed them and walked away. Hiromi slumped against the wall, holding her baby, and people walked by. Everybody was in a terrible rush. Nobody wanted to get involved. Nobody stopped him and nobody helped her.\u201d</p><p>How terrible. To lie there and bleed out slowly into the street, knowing your child is dead in your arms. How awful.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know she was dying outside of our store,\u201d Mr. Komatsu said. \u201cWhen we found her, she had no pulse. She looked dead. We brought her and the little girl inside, in here. They were both cold and neither had a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe flare had unleashed a phoenix and the city was burning,\u201d August\u2019s mother said. \u201cWe had to go. We left her. Meanwhile, the flare had awakened magic within Hiromi and pulled her back from death, but her little girl didn\u2019t survive. When we came back after the flare, she had woven a cocoon within the store. Before she left, she warned us that everyone would pay.\u201d</p><p>I had this sick cold feeling in the pit of my stomach. I knew exactly how this story would end.</p><p>\u201cShe remembered everyone who\u2019d passed by her as she lay dying and didn\u2019t stop to help,\u201d Mr. Komatsu said. \u201cOn the one-year anniversary of her child\u2019s death, a mark and a note appeared on the door of the first family. Hiromi demanded a sacrifice: One member of the family had to go to her so she could ... feed. If someone volunteered, the rest of the family would be left alone. They ignored it at first. Three days later she took the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe families put together our money and hired the Mercenary Guild,\u201d August\u2019s mother murmured. \u201cShe killed them. Nobody would help us after that.\u201d</p><p>If only I could speak. They had let this monster terrorize them. They didn\u2019t ask for help. They could\u2019ve gone to the Order, they could\u2019ve gone to the cops. They could\u2019ve gone to the Pack\u2014August was a shapeshifter, after all, and his family was in danger. But they didn\u2019t, because everyone was too ashamed to admit that they had let a young woman and her child die alone on the street in plain view. They just took their punishment, paid their blood debt, and lived with guilt. It was the old honorable way and it cost them so many lives.</p><p>August\u2019s mother kept talking. \u201cShe is growing stronger and stronger. She has turned her cat into a nekomata, and it serves her with dark magic. Even her blood is no longer human. She bleeds ichor like a spider. She is growing greedy like one, too. People have been disappearing more and more as time goes by. Every year she marks a new door. This year she marked ours.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d guessed as much.</p><p>\u201cI said I should go.\u201d August\u2019s grandmother drew herself upright. \u201cI\u2019m old. I\u2019ve lived long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe argued about it,\u201d August\u2019s mother said. \u201cWhile we argued, August decided that nobody should go. He went to meet Hiromi himself.\u201d Her voice broke and she closed her eyes.</p><p>August had died for them. For his family. The first son of the new generation, the heir to the family. They had lost their future and they were crushed.</p><p>Because August had disobeyed and fought, Hiromi had toyed with him. She must\u2019ve infected him somehow, and he brought her magic with him to the shapeshifter office. Jim was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and now she wanted him. Well, she couldn\u2019t have him. He was mine.</p><p>Mr. Komatsu rose and put his arms around his sister. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened between Hiromi and my nephew. We found August\u2019s body on our doorstep. He was drained. His corpse, it was devoid of all liquid. We buried him. The mark has disappeared from our door. We cannot help you. Now leave us in peace so we can grieve.\u201d</p><p>I rose and walked out, leaving the shards of a broken family behind me. I felt sick, but I finally knew what my enemy was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I STOOD NEXT to my mother by the kitchen window. Through it, I could see the garden and Jim by the tree. It had taken eight hours for Keong Emas to mature and every hour had added years to Jim\u2019s face. His beautiful skin looked dull, as if rubbed with ash. Puffy circles clutched at his eyes. He looked exhausted, drained, like a man who had spent a decade working in some hellish mine. Only the eyes remained the same: sharp, dangerous eyes, backlit from within by a lethal green glow. He had the will to live, but no strength to keep going.</p><p>He was dying.</p><p>Poor Jim. My poor, poor Jim.</p> <p>My mother pursed her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour magic will not work on her. She is an insect demon.\u201d</p><p>Arachnid, actually. \u201cI have a plan, Mother.\u201d</p><p>My mother turned to me slowly. Her lip trembled.</p> <p>Oh my gods.</p><p>She hugged me, clenching me to her. \u201cMy brave baby, you\u2019re the only one I have. The only one. My precious one, my sweet daughter. You\u2019re my everything. I\u2019m begging you, please, please, let him go.\u201d</p><p>I smelled tears and I knew she was crying, and then I cried, too. \u201cI can\u2019t, Mother. I love him so much. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She held on to me so tight, she must\u2019ve been afraid I\u2019d disappear into thin air. We stood holding each other for a long minute, and then she let me go. \u201cAll right. I will help you then.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the glass jar. Inside it, a single fat pupa hung off the glass wall.</p><p>My mother sniffed back her tears. \u201cWe go now.\u201d</p> <p>We went out into the garden, my mother leading the way, and me following, carrying my calligraphy kit and old keris in my hand. The dagger curved in a wavy pattern from the asymmetrical base to the razor-sharp point, and the dozen metals that formed the blade shimmered as if the weapon was forged out of silvery running water.</p><p>Up close, Jim looked even worse. My family had kept him awake, but it had sapped all of his strength. Only the shell of a man was left.</p><p>Jim saw the knife. His lips moved. The words came out slowly. \u201cIf you needed a good knife, I\u2019d let you borrow one of mine. You can\u2019t even cut straight with that thing.\u201d</p><p>I almost cried again.</p><p>My mother looked at me. Last chance to change my mind.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>She sighed, opened the jar, and touched the tip of the pupa with her finger. Magic sparked through the tiny cocoon. It cracked and fell apart, breaking into dust. A radiant moth spread its wings in the pupa\u2019s place. Magic washed over me, warm beautiful magic, so potent and strong, it made my heart skip a beat. I held my breath.</p><p>Golden and glorious, glowing with a soft light, Keong Emas crawled to the lip of the jar. It fluttered its wings, sending tiny sparks of magic into the air, and took to the air, raining golden dust and minuscule bits of magic. It hovered above Jim, circled above him once, twice, fluttered through the garden, and flew away, far into the trees.</p> <p>The entire garden lay bathed in a golden glow, tiny sparks of magic gleaming on plant leaves like precious jewels. I\u2019d never seen anything so beautiful.</p><p>Mother gasped. I spun to Jim. Long strands of spiderweb clenched his neck, stretching upward, growing more transparent with each inch until they finally vanished about three feet above his head.</p><p>I glanced at my mother. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>She set the glass jar down, turned, and fled. The rest of my family followed. In a moment, the garden and the house were deserted. Only Jim and I were left.</p><p>I came over and knelt by him. He slumped on the bench. He was so weak, he probably couldn\u2019t even move.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>Ashen lips moved. \u201cGreat. Never better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out what happened,\u201d I told him. \u201cDuring the last flare, a woman and her daughter were stabbed in South Asia. They bled out into the street and nobody helped. It was horrible. The daughter died, but the woman survived. She turned into a monster and once a year she demands a sacrifice from the people who ignored her dying.\u201d</p><p>Jim\u2019s voice was weak. \u201cHow long has that been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nobody said anything?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThey felt ashamed. They tried hiring the Guild, but she killed the mercenaries. It became every family for themselves. August\u2019s family was the last one targeted. He went to fight the monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith no backup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jim sighed. \u201cPeople are idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat theory seems likely, yes.\u201d</p><p>Jim coughed. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are spiderwebs attached to your throat. I\u2019m going to cut them with my pretty magic knife. When I do, you will faint from shock. Then the woman will come back and try to devour you anyway, because her type never lets prey get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why everyone left?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to curse her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Jim stared at me. \u201cDali?\u201d</p><p>How did he always know when I was hiding something? \u201cThere is a small problem with that. My curses only work on animals and people. Something with blood. Hiromi has no blood. She has insect slime. Remember the kanji character you saw on the floor? Joro, the whore? That was part of her demon name. That\u2019s why August knew it. His family had been terrified of her for years. She\u2019s jorogumo, the whore spider. So I\u2019ll have to be creative.\u201d And if I fail, you will never wake up.</p><p>He tried to rise but managed only a twitch.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me,\u201d I told him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a vegetarian blind girl save your behind really bothers you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>I took his hand and squeezed it, trying to keep the tears out of my voice. \u201cI\u2019m about to cut the web, Jim. You have about a minute, so if there is something you really need to tell me, you have to do it now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes told me he understood. This could be the last time we spoke to each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about our fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgive you,\u201d I told him, and sliced through the first line. The keris severed it in one short cut. It blinked and vanished. \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like not to be pretty. It\u2019s because you\u2019ve always been hot.\u201d</p><p>He coughed. \u201cHot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever looked at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. I look at you all the time, Jim.\u201d I severed the second line. It disappeared. A shudder ran through Jim\u2019s body. His legs trembled.</p><p>\u201cAbout Indonesian,\u201d Jim said. \u201cI learned it so I could talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jim. What the hell, I might never see him again. This was my last chance. I leaned over and kissed his lips.</p><p>He kissed me back. It was tender and loving and everything I had dreamed it would be. Tears ran down my face and I couldn\u2019t stop them. I loved him. I didn\u2019t know if he loved me back. He might have kissed me out of gratitude or for some other strange reason, but it seemed so unimportant now. If someone offered me a choice, his life or his love, I would give him up. Even if it meant he would never remember me and we would never speak again. As long as he lived. That\u2019s all I wanted. I just wanted him to be okay.</p><p>We broke apart and I looked into his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKick her ass,\u201d he said.</p><p>I cut the third line.</p><p>His eyes rolled back in his head. He slumped back. I touched my fingers to his neck. Alive. Come on, Lyc-V. Fix him up.</p><p>There was nothing left to do but wait. I sat down. If I were Kate, I could pull out my sword and when Hiromi showed up, I\u2019d spit some magic at her and then cut her to pieces. If I were Andrea, I\u2019d shoot it until it died. If I were Jim\u2019s cousin, who served as the female cat alpha until Jim found a mate, I\u2019d rip into her with claws. But I wasn\u2019t. I was me. All I had was my brain, ink, and some paper.</p><p>I opened my kit and began to write.</p><p>A small noise made me raise my head. A Japanese woman stood on the edge of the garden. She wore a long, flowing white robe. Her skin was like fine porcelain, her eyes were beautifully shaped, and her hair spilled down her back like glossy black silk.</p><p>Twenty minutes. Didn\u2019t take her long at all.</p><p>\u201cYou can drop the disguise,\u201d I said. \u201cI know what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d she asked. Her voice was like a silver bell. Even if she didn\u2019t attack Jim, I\u2019d hate her out of pure jealousy.</p><p>\u201cYou are a jorogumo. The whore spider.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s kimono split at the bottom and ripped apart. Thick chitin legs spilled forth, bristling with stiff dark hairs. A demonic creature rose before me: her bottom half, spider, and her top half, a human torso sheathed in overlapping bands of black exoskeleton. Her spider body was as long as my Prowler and twice as wide. This was bad.</p><p>Ice clamped my spine. My throat threatened to close up. I bet Kate never got scared like that. I unclenched my teeth. \u201cI think I just threw up a little bit in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man is mine.\u201d Hiromi pointed her slender arm at Jim.</p><p>\u201cNo, this man is mine.\u201d</p><p>Hiromi moved forward, one spider leg after another, probing the ground. I watched her come toward me, a dark monster in the glowing garden. In life she had so little, and the only thing she treasured, her daughter, was ripped away from her. If I were Hiromi, I\u2019d see becoming a demon as a great honor. It was my chance to use my powers to punish those who wronged me, to be strong and feared. But the longer she stretched out her revenge, the more selfish she became. Punishing the wicked was no longer enough, I could see it in her eyes. She had given in to greed.</p><p>She was almost to the line I\u2019d scratched earlier in the dirt. Step, another step ...</p><p>If the magic fell, both Jim and I would be in serious trouble.</p><p>The ugly spider leg touched the line. A gold glow sparked and dashed across the grass and rocks, outlining an octagon with Jim in the center. The demon yowled and recoiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA very complicated ward. Took me an hour to make,\u201d I told her. I had made it while still in tiger form, after I had learned at the grocery store what I would be facing.</p><p>\u201cI am Hiromi Jorogumo, the Binding Maiden, the Bloody Mother. You will give him to me!\u201d</p><p>Wow, now she was bestowing titles on herself. I crossed my arms on my chest. \u201cAnd I am Dali, the White Tiger, the Guardian of Bunut Bolog. My magic is as strong as yours. You will not pass.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d guessed right\u2014Hiromi was hung up on being a jorogumo. She viewed it as an honor and she was arrogant and vain, which meant I had a chance. It was a tiny, tiny chance, but it was better than nothing. I just had to play the game by her rules.</p><p>A grimace jerked her face. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of you, Dali Harimau, White Tiger. You can\u2019t guard him all the time. He has to sleep eventually and when he does, I will devour him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not arguing with you. That\u2019s why I want to offer you a bargain.\u201d I held up the piece of paper.</p><p>Hiromi leaned forward. \u201cWhat bargain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA contract. You ask me a riddle. If I answer correctly, you will leave him and me alone.\u201d</p> <p>Riddles were the traditional way to resolve issues. If she truly thought like a demon, it would appeal to her.</p><p>Hiromi\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you get to eat Jim and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? The magical White Tiger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Hiromi\u2019s mouth gaped open, releasing a row of sharp fangs. Saliva stretched down from her teeth in thin strands. She was imagining eating me and drooling. Eww.</p> <p>\u201cThree riddles,\u201d she said. \u201cYou answer every one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>I corrected the contract.</p><p>\u201cWhat guarantee do I have that you will submit?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe contract is magically binding.\u201d I put the paper on the ground and pushed it across the ward with a stick. \u201cIt\u2019s signed in my blood. If you sign it in your ichor, we will have a deal.\u201d</p><p>Hiromi lowered her big spider body to the ground and swiped the piece of paper with her human hand.</p><p>Come on, Hiromi. Be as greedy as I hope you to be.</p><p>Hiromi struck at her side. Pale translucent liquid spilled out, carrying with it small knots of yellow slime. Ew, ew, ew!</p> <p>The jorogumo dipped her finger into the liquid and drew it across the contract. Magic snapped, clutching at the paper.</p><p>I took a deep breath and touched the ward. It melted into nothing.</p><p>\u201cFirst riddle.\u201d Hiromi bared her teeth. \u201cIt rises to the heavens but never reaches them; it flies like a bird but has no wings; it makes you weep without a cause; those who see it stop and stare; it served as my black funeral shroud and it was the only one I had. What is it?\u201d</p><p>Funeral shroud. What did she see as she lay dying? People walking and the city on fire, because of the phoenix birthed by the flare. And where there was fire, there was ... \u201cSmoke,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen you died, Atlanta was burning. Next.\u201d</p><p>Hiromi clamped her mouth shut. Her spider legs kneaded the ground. \u201cMen make it, but gods crave it; its loss weakens, its appearance threatens; fear chills it, war heats it; it binds family together, and I watched mine leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood. You watched yourself bleed out onto the street.\u201d</p><p>Hiromi rocked back and forth. She had powerful magic, but it didn\u2019t make her smart. The blood riddle was almost painfully obvious. What else could fear chill except for your blood?</p><p>\u201cLast one.\u201d</p><p>Hiromi shifted back and forth, left and right, thinking. On the bench Jim opened his eyes. He blinked and saw the jorogumo. His lips drew back, revealing his teeth. Hiromi saw him and hissed, her legs churning the ground.</p><p>I pointed at Jim. \u201cStay where you are! Hiromi, we had a deal. The last riddle.\u201d</p><p>Hiromi bit the air with her fangs and hissed at me. \u201cIt has eyes but cannot see; it has ears but doesn\u2019t listen; it has fangs, but it doesn\u2019t hunt; it has a womb, but it\u2019s shriveled and dry; it has knowledge but can\u2019t save itself; it will die alone, regretting everything. What is it?\u201d</p><p>Ha! \u201cIt\u2019s me. Do you think I don\u2019t know myself, Hiromi?\u201d</p><p>She snarled. Spit flew from her mouth.</p><p>That\u2019s right, rage away. You know you want a piece of me. I\u2019m so tasty. Come get me.</p><p>Hiromi wailed in helpless fury.</p><p>She was almost there. I just had to piss her off enough. \u201cYou are stupid, Hiromi. Baka, baka Hiromi. You are dumb like a worm.\u201d</p><p>White substance burst from behind her in wet clumps and flew to the trees and the house, unfurling into webs.</p><p>Behind me Jim tried to rise.</p><p>\u201cJim, stay down!\u201d I barked. \u201cLook at him, you had him and I took him away from you. Even if you weren\u2019t a freak, he would never be with you. There is nothing you can do about it, Hiromi. Nothing! We will go free. You are weak! Helpless and we\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hiromi let out a screech and charged at me. The huge spider body swept me off my feet. Hiromi\u2019s chitin arms grasped me and dragged me up to her mouth.</p><p>Jim pushed himself off the bench and stumbled forward, like a drunk man on wet cotton legs.</p><p>A sweet, slightly woodsy aroma drifted through the air.</p><p>Hiromi\u2019s mouth gaped at me, the fangs dripping drool and venom.</p><p>A swarm of long yellow petals swirled around us. Wet mist slicked my skin and Hiromi\u2019s chitin.</p><p>Jim conquered the last two feet and clamped onto Hiromi\u2019s spider leg, trying to rip it apart.</p><p>Hiromi\u2019s arms shook. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPunishment for eating people.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers lost their strength. I slipped through them and fell clumsily on my butt.</p><p>Hiromi reared above me on her hind limbs, the six remaining spider legs waving in the air. Her back arched, farther and farther, and for a second I thought she would crush me. The jorogumo screamed, a desperate shriek of pain and sheer terror.</p><p>Jim threw himself over me.</p><p>Hiromi twisted left, her legs jerking back and forth, rocked by spasms. She dashed into the water and smashed into the statue of Lakshmi, leaving a yellowish splatter on her side, veered left, banged into a tree, trampled through the oleander bushes, rammed herself into the fence, and spun in place, screaming. The yellow petals chased her, clinging to her skin.</p><p>I pulled Jim up into a sitting position and hugged him in case he fell. He wouldn\u2019t remember it later anyway\u2014far more exciting things were happening.</p><p>Hiromi\u2019s legs churned the ground. She sprinted to the house, ran up the wall partway, until she was almost vertical, and crashed back down. Her human arms flailed. She plunged them into her body and ripped chunks of skin out.</p><p>Her front left leg snapped like a toothpick. She screeched and hammered herself into the house. A yellow stain spread on the wall. She rammed the house again and again. The brick walls shook. Tiny cracks crisscrossed Hiromi\u2019s body. She charged the house again and her body burst. Ichor drenched the wall. The remains of the jorogumo slid down and lay still.</p><p>A sickly salty smell hit us.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a thing,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>He came for me again. He could barely move, but he dragged himself up and threw himself at an enraged demon for my sake. It was enough to make a girl cry. Except that now the danger had passed and my head was clear. I knew I was reading too much into it.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t curse her directly, so I wrote a contract with a curse in it. She signed it with her ichor,\u201d I said. \u201cShe gave it power over herself, and when she broke the agreement, it tore her apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the petals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrysanthemums.\u201d I smiled and rested my cheek on his shoulder. \u201cThe punishment curse written into the contract. They produce pyrethrum oil. It\u2019s deadly to insects and arachnids: It attacks their central nervous system, drives them mad, and then kills them.\u201d</p><p>We looked at the yellow mess on the side of the house.</p><p>\u201cMy mother is going to kill me,\u201d I said.</p><p>I TOOK THE metal teakettle off the stove and poured boiling water into the smaller ceramic one. The delicate jasmine fragrance spread through my kitchen. Around me my house was quiet.</p><p>It had taken two days to clean up my mother\u2019s house. For two days I did nothing but scrub nasty demonic spider insides off the walls, the benches, and the rocks while Jim got to eat great food and be fussed over by my mother. Last night he got better and left. I spent the night at my mother\u2019s and then came back to my place. The mail had piled up. Pooki probably missed me, although he didn\u2019t say anything when I came to check on him in the garage.</p><p>It was evening now. I poured the tea and sat on my short couch.</p><p>I\u2019d made a total fool of myself. I had kissed Jim and then I hugged him. So embarrassing. Hopefully he wouldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>That\u2019s what happened when you let your emotions get the better of you\u2014you lost the ability to think clearly. Sooner or later we would have to work together. It would be so awkward. I put my hand over my face. I was by myself in the house and I was still embarrassed.</p><p>Sad, pathetic blind girl drinking her tea and hiding her face. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. I needed another race. It would make me feel better. Somewhere in that stack of paper was the estimate from the repair shop. The sooner I gave them the okay, the faster I\u2019d get Rambo back.</p><p>A familiar male scent tugged on me.</p><p>Oh my gods. No. No, no, no, no.</p><p>I took my hand from my eyes.</p><p>He was inside the room, leaning on the wall next to my patio door. He looked great. Like nothing ever happened.</p><p>What do I do now?</p><p>Jim raised a small wicker basket.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a steak for me and mushroom pasta for you. The pasta is made with tofu and palm oil instead of eggs. I cooked it myself. My steak is wrapped in several layers of foil. It\u2019s not touching the container with your food, so no worries.\u201d</p><p>Um ... He made me dinner. He cooked for me. In shapeshifter terms that was like delivering three dozen red roses with a tag that read I LOVE YOU. What in the world was he doing? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought you might want a change from your mother\u2019s cooking.\u201d Jim grinned. He looked almost unbearably handsome. \u201cNot that it isn\u2019t great, but three days of rice is a little much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem with being an alpha is that you can never make the first move. Makes you feel like you\u2019re taking advantage of your position. You have to wait until the other person decides they want in.\u201d</p> <p>Jim set the basket on the coffee table and crouched by me.</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes it seems like that person likes you, and you try to test the waters, so you try to tell her how you feel, that she matters and that you want to be with her and you\u2019re concerned about her safety. And every time you do that, she waves her arms around and accuses you of being a controlling alpha asshole. So you back off and hope you didn\u2019t completely fuck it up.\u201d</p><p>He was close, too close. I just stared at him. What was happening ... \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>His voice was low and smooth. \u201cThat time when I told you it didn\u2019t matter what your mother thought about your looks ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI meant it,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I think you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>This was actually really, really happening.</p><p>He kissed me.</p><p>Oh my gods.</p><p>Dear Readers:</p><p>Writing this novella was a blast. We had a lot of fun, and we hope you enjoyed reading about these characters as much as we enjoyed writing about them. We couldn\u2019t fit everything we wanted to into the word limit of the novella, and we have gotten so many requests from readers who want to know more about Jim and Dali\u2019s background that we\u2019re planning to work on a full-length novel featuring these characters in the near future.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t want to wait to read more about the cranky jaguar, check out Gunmetal Magic, where Jim is doing what he does best: keeping the Pack safe and spying on everyone he can.</p><p>Read on for an exciting preview from the new novel in the world of Kate Daniels</p><p>GUNMETAL MAGIC</p><p>by Ilona Andrews</p><p>Available August 2012 from Ace Books</p><p>The world has suffered a magic apocalypse. We pushed the technological progress too far, and now magic has returned with a vengeance. It came like an invisible tide, ripping planes out of the sky, dropping monsters onto crowded streets, sucking the power plants dry, and jamming firearms. Some people awoke and found themselves shapeshifters. Others died, cut down by a magic-fueled disease, and rose again as mindless undead, robbed of their ability to reason and driven only by their all-consuming hunger. Gods became real, curses gained power, and telekinesis and telepathy were no longer the products of illusion and special effects.</p><p>For three days the magic raged and then it vanished without warning, leaving the world reeling, its population decimated, its cities in tatters.</p><p>Since that day, the day of the Shift, the magic comes and goes as it pleases. It floods the planet like a wave crashing on the shoreline, hissing and boiling, leaving its dangerous gifts, and then recedes once again. Sometimes a wave lasts half an hour, sometimes three days. Nobody can predict it and nobody knows what our future holds.</p> <p>But we are resilient. We will survive.</p><p>\u201c40th Anniversary of the Shift\u201d</p><p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</p><p>THUD!</p><p>My head hit the sidewalk. Candy jerked me up by my hair and slammed my face into the asphalt.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>\u201cHit her again!\u201d Michelle squeaked, her teenage voice shrill.</p><p>I knew it was a dream, because it didn\u2019t hurt. The fear was still there, that sharp, hot terror, mixed with helpless rage, the kind of fear that turns you from a human being into an animal. Things become distilled to simple concepts: I was small, they were big; I was weak, they were strong. They hurt me, and I endured.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>My skull bounced off the pavement. Blood stained my blond hair. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Sarah take a running start like a kicker before a field goal. The flesh on her body boiled. Bones grew, muscles wound around them like cotton candy over a stick, hair sprouted, sheathing the new body, half human, half animal, in a coat of pale sandy fur dappled with telltale hyena spots. The bouda grinned at me, her malformed mouth full of fangs. I clenched up, curling my ten-year-old self into a ball. The clawed foot crashed into my ribs. The three-inch claws scraped a bone and it crunched inside me like a snapped chopstick. She kept kicking me.</p><p>Thud, thud, thud!</p><p>This was a dream. A dream grown from my memories, but still just a dream. I knew this, because ten years after my mother took eleven-year-old me and fled halfway across the country, I came back and put two bullets through Sarah\u2019s eyes. I had emptied a clip into Candy\u2019s left ear. I still remembered the way her skull had blossomed with red when the bullets tore out the other side. I had killed the entire werehyena clan. I wiped those bouda bitches off the face of the planet, because the world was a better place with them gone. Michelle was the only one who had escaped.</p><p>I sat up and grinned at them. \u201cI\u2019m waking up, ladies. Go fuck yourselves.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped open. I lay in my closet, wrapped in a blanket and holding a butcher knife. The door of the closet stood slightly ajar, and the gray light of early morning slipped through the narrow gap.</p><p>Fantastic. Andrea Nash, decorated veteran of the Order, hiding in her closet with her knife and a blankie. I should\u2019ve held on to the dream long enough to beat them into bloody pulp. At least then I wouldn\u2019t feel so completely pathetic.</p><p>I inhaled, sampling the air. The normal scents of my apartment floated to me, the hint of synthetic apple from the soap in the bathroom, the fragrance of vanilla from the candle by my bed, and strongest of all, the stench of dog fur, a leftover from when my friend Kate\u2019s poodle Grendel had kept me company. That freak of nature had slept at the foot of my bed, and his distinctive reek was permanently imprinted on my rug.</p><p>No intruders.</p><p>The scents were muted, which meant the magic was down.</p><p>Thud-thud-thud!</p><p>What in the world?</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Someone was pounding on my door.</p><p>I kicked off my blanket, rolled to my feet, and ran out of the closet. My bedroom greeted me: my big bed, intruder-free; the crumpled mess of the blanket on the rug; my jeans and bra, discarded last night by the bed, next to a Lorna Sterling paperback with a pirate in a poofy shirt on the cover; bookcase, stuffed to the brim; pale blue curtains on the barred window, undisturbed.</p><p>I dropped the butcher knife onto my side table, pulled on my pajamas pants, grabbed my Sig-Sauer P226 from under the pillow, and ran to the door. Waking up with a gun in my hand would\u2019ve made a lot more sense, but no, I\u2019d woken up clutching a knife. That meant I must\u2019ve gotten up in the middle of the night, run into the kitchen, taken a knife from the butcher block, run back into the bedroom, grabbed a blanket, and hidden in the closet. All without realizing where I was or what I was doing. If that wasn\u2019t crazy, I didn\u2019t know what was.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t slept with a knife since I was a teenager. This blast from the past wasn\u2019t welcome and it needed to go away real fast.</p><p>Thud-thud!</p><p>I reached the door and stood on my toes to look through the peephole. A tall black woman in her fifties stood on the other side. Her gray hair stuck out from her head in a mess, she was wearing a nightgown, and her face was so twisted by worry, I barely recognized her. Mrs. Haffey. She and her husband lived in an apartment right below me.</p><p>Normally Mrs. Haffey viewed her appearance as serious business. In terms of battle readiness, she was my hero\u2014I\u2019ve never seen her without her makeup and hair perfectly done. Something was really wrong.</p><p>I unlocked the door.</p><p>\u201cAndrea!\u201d Mrs. Haffey gasped. Behind her, long white strands covered the landing and the stairwell. I was one hundred percent sure they hadn\u2019t been there when I\u2019d dragged myself into my apartment last night.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarin\u2019s missing!\u201d</p><p>I pulled her into my apartment and shut the door. \u201cI need you to tell me from the beginning, slowly and clearly: what happened?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Haffey took a deep breath. She had been a cop\u2019s wife for twenty-five years and her experience from dealing with a lifetime of emergencies kicked in. Her voice was almost steady. \u201cI woke up and made coffee. Darin got up to take Chief outside. I took a shower. When I came out, Darin wasn\u2019t back. I went out on the balcony, but he wasn\u2019t in his usual spot.\u201d</p><p>I knew exactly where the usual spot was: two stories under my bedroom window, where the Haffeys\u2019 bulldog, Chief, preferred to mark his territory. I smelled it on my way to work every morning. Of course, Chief smelled my scent and it only made him more determined to pee his way to territorial supremacy.</p><p>\u201cI called and called Darin, and nothing. I tried to go downstairs. There\u2019s blood all over the landing and a white substance on the stairs and it\u2019s blocking the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Mr. Haffey take his gun with him?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Haffey had retired from the Paranormal Activity Division of the Atlanta Police Department. PAD cops took their guns seriously. As far as I knew, Darin Haffey never left the house without his Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P340 snub-nosed revolver.</p><p>\u201cHe always takes his gun with him,\u201d Mrs. Haffey said.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t fired it, because his revolver ate .357 Magnum cartridges. When he pulled the trigger, the shot sounded like a small cannon going off. I would\u2019ve heard the gunshot and recognized it even through the dream. Whatever happened, happened fast.</p><p>The mysterious \u201cwhite substance\u201d must\u2019ve appeared as a result of the magic wave last night. Kate, my best friend, had warded my apartment months ago. Invisible spells shielded my place in a protective barrier. She\u2019d covered the perimeter walls, the ceiling, and the floor. Anything magic would have a hard time breaking in, which probably explained why I\u2019d slept safe and secure through the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know Darin\u2019s blind as a bat.\u201d Mrs. Haffey twisted her hands. \u201cHe can\u2019t even see what he\u2019s shooting at. The other day he comes running out of the bathroom, screaming and foaming at the mouth. He\u2019d brushed his teeth with Aspercreme instead of toothpaste ...\u201d</p><p>A note of hysteria slipped into her voice. At five ten, she had eight inches of height on me and she was leaning over. \u201cI called down to the station, but they say it will be twenty minutes or longer. I thought since you were with the Order ...\u201d</p><p>I used to be with the Order. When I was a Knight of Merciful Aid, it was my job to help people when the cops wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t assist them with the magic hazmat. I had decorations and a stellar service record, but none of it mattered when the Order found out that I was a shapeshifter. They branded me mentally disturbed and unfit for duty and \u201cretired\u201d me.</p> <p>But they didn\u2019t take away my training or my skills.</p><p>I pressed a latch in my wall. A panel slid aside, revealing a small niche that used to be a hallway closet and which I had converted into my own personal armory. A row of gun barrels gleamed in the morning light.</p><p>Mrs. Haffey clicked her mouth shut.</p><p>Let\u2019s see. I\u2019d be bringing my Sigs, but I needed something with more power. The AA-12, an Automatic Assault 12-gauge shotgun with a 32-round clip was always a good choice. It fired 300 rounds per minute with minimal recoil. I filled mine with steel slugs. Squeeze the trigger once, and get a single shot that would punch through a car door. Hold the trigger, and anything on the other end, no matter how much hard body armor it wore, would become a smoking pile of meat in six and a half seconds. I\u2019d paid a fortune for it and it was worth every dollar.</p><p>I grabbed the AA-12 and put on a hip holster, into which I stuck my Sig and its twin. \u201cMrs. Haffey, I need you to stay here.\u201d I gave her a nice big smile. \u201cLock the door behind me and don\u2019t open it until I come back. Do you understand?\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Haffey nodded.</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I stepped onto the landing and heard the deadbolt slide shut behind me.</p><p>The \u201cwhite substance\u201d stretched in long pale strands over the walls. It resembled a spiderweb, if the spider was the size of a bowling ball and instead of working in a spiral had decided to weave only in a vertical direction. I crossed the landing and inhaled. Usually there was an up-draft here, the air rising from the front entrance to the top of the building. Today no movement troubled the stairway, but I smelled the sharp metallic odor of fresh blood all the same. Tiny hairs on the back of my neck stood up. The predator in me, the other me sleeping deep inside, opened her eyes.</p><p>I padded down the stairs, moving silently on the concrete steps, my shotgun ready. Even though magic made my existence possible, it didn\u2019t mean that magic and I played nice. Give me guns over spells any day.</p><p>The web grew thicker. At the Haffeys\u2019 landing, it swallowed the walls and the wooden stair rail. I turned, heading down. The stench of blood assaulted my nostrils and I tasted it on my tongue. All of my senses went into overdrive. My heart beat faster. My pupils dilated, improving my vision. My breathing sped up. My hearing sharpened and I caught a distant noise, muffled, but unmistakable: the deep, throaty bark of a bulldog.</p> <p>I took a few more steps down. Blood stained the stairs. A large amount, at least a couple of pints, possibly more, all in big round drops. Either someone bled and walked, or someone bled and was carried. Please don\u2019t be Darin. I liked Darin and I liked his wife. Mrs. Haffey was always kind to me.</p><p>The first floor landing was a narrow tunnel within the web. The door to apartment 1A was intact, but buried in white strands. The same solid wall of white sealed the way downstairs, and none of it was torn. No sign of Darin going that way. The door to 1B lay in a splintered wreck. Bloody marks stretched across the threshold, pointing into the apartment. Someone had been dragged inside.</p><p>I stepped into the hallway. A new scent tugged at me, a slightly sour, prickly odor that set off instinctual alarms in my head. Not good.</p><p>The apartment had the exact same layout as mine: a narrow hallway, opening into the kitchen on the right, the living room on the left, then the first bedroom, and then a short perpendicular hallway leading to the utility room and guest bathroom, and finally to the master bedroom with a bathroom en suite.</p><p>I moved in, nice and easy, slicing the pie around the corner: starting at the wall and moving at a ninety degree angle away from it, leaning slightly away from the wall to see the threat around the corner before it saw me. Jumping around the corners was very dramatic but would get your head blown off.</p><p>Kitchen\u2014clear.</p><p>I moved into the living room.</p><p>On the left, by a coffee table, sat a large wicker basket full of yarn. Two long wooden needles stuck out of it at an angle. Next to the basket lay a severed human arm. The blood had pooled from it, soaking the beige wall-to-wall carpet in a dark red stain.</p> <p>Pale skin. Not Darin Haffey. No, this was likely Mrs. Truman who lived in this apartment with her two cats. She liked to play bridge with her knitting club and collected yarn for \u201cspecial\u201d projects, with which she never did anything. Now her torn-off arm lay next to the basket with her knitting stash. No time to absorb and deal with it. I still had Darin to find.</p><p>I moved on. The sour prickly scent grew stronger.</p><p>Bedroom\u2014clear. Bathroom\u2014clear.</p><p>A huge hole gaped in the floor of the utility room. Something had smashed through the floor and tile from below.</p><p>I circled the hole, shotgun pointing down.</p><p>No movement. The floor below me looked clear.</p><p>A muffled noise cut through the quiet.</p><p>My ears twitched.</p><p>Woof! Woof!</p><p>Chief was still alive somewhere in there. I jumped into the hole, landed on the concrete floor of the basement, and moved away from the light streaming through the hole. No need to present a clear target.</p><p>Gloom filled the basement, dripping from the web into dark corners. The walls no longer existed. There was only web, white and endless.</p><p>My eyes adjusted to the darkness. Shapeshifter vision guaranteed that as long as there was some light, I wouldn\u2019t bump into things.</p><p>Wet dark smears marred the concrete. Blood. I followed it.</p><p>Ahead the concrete split. A long fissure ran through the floor, at least three feet wide. The apartment building was already none too sturdy. The magic hated tall buildings and gnawed on them, pulverizing brick and mortar until the structure crashed down. The bigger the building, the faster it fell. Ours was too short and too small and so far we had escaped unscathed, but giant holes in the basement didn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence.</p><p>A snorting noise came from inside the gap. I leaned over it. A whiff of dog-fur stink washed over me. Chief, you silly knucklehead.</p><p>I crouched by the hole. The bulldog squirmed below, snorting up a storm. He must\u2019ve fallen into the fissure, and the drop was too sheer for him to jump out.</p><p>I put my shotgun on the ground and leaned in, grabbing Chief by the scruff of his neck. The bulldog weighed eighty pounds at least. What in the world were the Haffeys feeding him, small elephants? I yanked him out and jumped to my feet, shotgun in my hands. The whole thing took half a second.</p><p>Chief pressed against my leg. He was an Olde English Bulldogge, a throwback to the times when the English Bulldog was used for bull-baiting. A powerful, agile dog, Chief feared neither garbage trucks, nor stray dogs or horses. Yet here he was, rubbing against my calf, freaked out.</p><p>I took a second to bend down and pet his big head. It will be okay, boy. You\u2019re with me now.</p><p>We started forward, moving slowly out of the first narrow room into a wider chamber. The web spanned the walls, creating hiding spots in the corners. Creepy as hell.</p><p>I carefully rounded the corner. At the far wall to my right, two furnaces sat side by side: the electric for the times when technology had the upper hand and the old-fashioned coal-burning monstrosity for use during the waves, when the magic robbed us of electric current. To the right of the coal furnace stood a large coal bin, a four-foot-high wooden enclosure filled with coal. On the coal, half-buried, lay Mr. Haffey.</p><p>Two creatures crawled on the concrete in front of the bin. About thirty inches tall and at least five feet long, they resembled huge wingless wasps, with a wide thorax-chest slimming down before flaring into thick abdomen. Stiff brown bristles covered their beige, nearly translucent bodies. Their heads, bigger than Chief\u2019s massive skull, bore mandibles the size of garden shears. Their claws scraped the concrete as they moved\u2014an eerie, nasty sound.</p><p>The left creature stopped and planted its six chitin-sheathed legs. Its tail end tilted up and a stream of viscous liquid shot out, adhering to the wall. The creature scrubbed its butt on the floor, anchoring the stream, and moved away as the secretions hardened into pale web.</p><p>Ew. Ew, ew, ew.</p><p>Mr. Haffey raised his head.</p><p>The creatures stopped, fixated on the movement.</p><p>I fired.</p><p>The shotgun barked, spitting thunder. The first steel slug punched into the right creature, cutting through the chitin like it was paper-thin plywood. The insect broke in half. Wet innards spilled onto the floor, like a bunch of swim bladders strung together. Without a pause, I turned and put a second shot into its buddy. Chief barked next to me, snapping his jaws. The creatures jerked and flailed, dragging their body chunks. The sour, spike-studded odor filled the air.</p><p>Darin Haffey sat up in the bin. \u201cI see Kayla dragged you into this.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cNo, sir, I just came to borrow a cup of sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeh.\u201d</p><p>The web obscuring the rest of the room to my left tore.</p><p>\u201cIncoming,\u201d Mr. Haffey snapped, raising his firearm.</p><p>The first insect burst into the open. I fired. Boom!</p><p>Two more. Boom, boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom, boom, boom!</p><p>The broken chitin bodies crashed into each other, making a pile of jerking legs and vomit-inducing entrails.</p><p>Boom, boom, boom! Boom!</p><p>An insect leaped over the pile, aiming for me. I swung the shotgun up. The impact exploded the creature\u2019s gut, spraying foul liquid over me. Bug juice burned my lips. Ugh.</p><p>A smaller insect dashed toward me. Sharp mandibles sliced at my leg. You bastard! Chief rammed the creature, ripping into the thing before I could sink a slug into it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>I kept firing. Finally the revolting flood stopped. I waited, listening, but no more skittering came. My calf burned. The pain didn\u2019t bother me too much, but I\u2019d be leaving a blood trail, which would make me ridiculously easy to track. I had five shots left in the AA-12. No way to know if I had killed them all or if this was the calm before the second wave of insects. I had to get Mr. Haffey out of here.</p><p>He was sitting in the coal bin, staring at the pile of insect parts. \u201cDamn. That\u2019s some shooting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe aim to please,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou aim like you mean business.\u201d</p><p>Funny thing, praise. I knew I was a great shot, but hearing it from the PAD veteran made me all warm and fuzzy anyway. \u201cHave you seen Mrs. Truman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her body. They ripped her to pieces, the assholes.\u201d</p><p>Poor Mrs. Truman. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe fuckers got me in the leg. I\u2019m bleeding like a stuck pig.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why he\u2019d hidden in the coal. He\u2019d buried his leg in the coal dust to smother the scent. Smart. \u201cTime to go, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou listen to me.\u201d Mr. Haffey put some cop hardness into his gruff voice. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for you to get me out. Even if I lean on you, I\u2019m two hundred and twenty pounds and my weight will just take you down with me. Leave me a gun, and you get out of here. Kayla must\u2019ve called over to the station. I\u2019ll hold them off until ...\u201d</p><p>I swung the shotgun over my shoulder and picked him up out of the coal. I wasn\u2019t as strong as a normal shapeshifter, although I was faster and more agile, but a two-hundred-pound man still wasn\u2019t a challenge.</p><p>I double-timed it to the hole, Chief at my heels. The bulldog had a death grip on a chitinous leg as long as he was. He had to lean his head back to carry it, but the look in his eyes said no army in the world could take it away.</p><p>\u201cThis is embarrassing,\u201d Mr. Haffey informed me.</p> <p>I winked at him. \u201cWhat, Mrs. Haffey never carried you over the threshold on your wedding night?\u201d</p><p>His eyes bulged. \u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous. What are you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d spent most of my life pretending to be human. But now the hyena was out of the bag, and sooner or later I had to start owning up to it. \u201cA shapeshifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bouda.\u201d Well, not exactly. The truth was more complicated, but I wasn\u2019t ready for those explanations yet.</p><p>We reached the hole. If I were a regular bouda, I could\u2019ve jumped out of the hole with Mr. Haffey in my arms. But I knew my limits and that wasn\u2019t happening. Throwing him out would injure his dignity beyond repair. \u201cI\u2019m going to lift you. Can you pull yourself up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the Pope Catholic?\u201d</p><p>I lowered him down, grabbed him by the hips, and heaved. Mr. Haffey pulled himself over the ledge and I got a real close look at that wound. It was a four-inch rip down his leg and touching his sweatpants left my palm bloody. He needed an ambulance yesterday.</p> <p>I tossed Chief and his prize out of the hole, jumped, caught the edge, and hopped up.</p><p>\u201cWill you at least carry me fireman-style?\u201d Mr. Haffey huffed.</p><p>\u201cNo can do, sir. I\u2019m trying to keep your blood from dripping out of your leg.\u201d</p><p>He growled deep under his breath.</p><p>I picked him up and started out. \u201cIt will all be over soon.\u201d</p><p>He guffawed.</p><p>I caught the familiar scuttling sound behind me, coming from the master bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI thought the Order didn\u2019t allow shapeshifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t. When they figured me out, they fired me.\u201d</p><p>The scuttling chased us.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit right there.\u201d Mr. Haffey shook his head. \u201cAnd discrimination. You talk to your union rep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. I fought it as long as I could. Anyway, they retired me with full pension. I can\u2019t appeal.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Haffey gave me an appraising look. \u201cYou took it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Told them to shove it.\u201d</p><p>I dropped him to the floor as gently as I could and spun, shotgun ready.</p><p>A huge pale insect lunged at us. I pumped two slugs into it and it thrashed on the floor. I gathered Mr. Haffey up and double-timed it to the door.</p><p>\u201cListen, most of my contacts have retired, but a few of us have kids in the department. If you need a job, I can probably fix up something. The PAD will be glad to have you. You\u2019re a hell of a shot. Shouldn\u2019t let that go to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch appreciated.\u201d I smiled. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a job. I work for a business. My best friend owns it.\u201d I started up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic hazmat removal. Protection. That type of thing.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Haffey opened his eyes. \u201cPrivate cop? You went private?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s cop mentality for you. I tell him I\u2019m a shapeshifter and he doesn\u2019t blink an eye. But private cop, oh no, that\u2019s not okay.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s business?\u201d Mr. Haffey squinted at me.</p><p>\u201cBusiness is fine.\u201d If by fine, one meant lousy. Between Kate Daniels and me, we had a wealth of skills, a small sea of experience, and enough smears on our reputation to kill a dozen careers. All of our clients were desperate, because by the time they came to us, everybody else had turned them down.</p><p>\u201cWhat does your man think about that?\u201d</p><p>Raphael Medrano. The memory of him was so raw, I could conjure his scent by just thinking about him. The strong male healthy scent that drove me crazy ...</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out,\u201d I said.</p><p>Mr. Haffey shifted, uncomfortable. \u201cYou need to drop that silliness and get back in uniform. We\u2019re talking retirement, benefits, advance in rank and pay ...\u201d</p><p>I ran up to my door. \u201cMrs. Haffey!\u201d</p><p>The door swung open. Mrs. Haffey\u2019s face went slack. \u201cOh my God, Darin. Oh God.\u201d</p><p>In the distance the familiar sirens blared.</p><p>THE CAVALRY ARRIVED with guns and in large numbers. They loaded Mr. Haffey into an ambulance, thanked me for my help, and told me that since I was a civilian, I needed to keep the hell out of their way. I didn\u2019t mind. I\u2019d killed most of what was down there and they had gotten all dressed up and gone through the trouble of bringing flamethrowers. It was only fair to let them have some fun.</p><p>I tended the cut on my leg. There wasn\u2019t much to do about it. Lyc-V, the virus responsible for shapeshifters\u2019 existence, repaired injuries at an accelerated rate, and by the time I got to it, the gash had sealed itself. In a couple of days, the leg would be like new, without scars. Some Lyc-V gifts were useful. Some, like berserker rage, I could live without.</p><p>I was scrubbing the bug juice off my face with my makeup removal washcloth, when the phone rang. I wiped the soap off my face and sprinted into the kitchen to pick it up.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNash?\u201d a smooth voice said into the phone.</p><p>The smooth voice belonged to Jim, a werejaguar and the Pack\u2019s security chief. He usually went by Jim Black, if you didn\u2019t know him well. I\u2019d dug through his background during my tenure with the Order. His real name was James Damael Shrapshire, a fact I kept to myself, since he didn\u2019t advertise it.</p><p>Atlanta\u2019s Shapeshifter Pack was the strongest in the nation, and my relationship with it was complicated. But the Pack backed Cutting Edge, the business Kate owned and for which I now worked. They had supplied the seed money and they were our first priority client.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jim. What can I do for you?\u201d Jim wasn\u2019t a bad guy. Paranoid and secretive, but then cats were odd creatures.</p><p>\u201cOne of our businesses got hit last night,\u201d Jim said. \u201cFour people are dead.\u201d</p><p>Someone obviously had a death wish and that someone wasn\u2019t very bright, because there were much easier ways of committing suicide. The Pack took care of their own and if you hurt their own, they made it a point to take care of you. \u201cAnybody I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Two jackals, a bouda, and a fox from Clan Nimble. I need you to go down there and check it out.\u201d</p><p>I headed into the bedroom. \u201cNo problem. But why me?\u201d</p><p>Jim sighed into the phone. \u201cAndrea, how many years did you spend as a knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d I began pulling my clothes onto the bed: socks, work boots, jeans ...</p><p>\u201cHow many of those did you spend on active cases?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d I added a box of ammo to the clothes pile on the bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why. You\u2019re the most experienced investigator I\u2019ve got who\u2019s not tied up in something, and I can\u2019t ask the Consort to look into it, because A) she and Curran are working on something else and B) when the Consort gets involved, half of the world blows up.\u201d</p><p>Kate the Consort. The title still made me grin. Every time someone used it, she got this martyred look on her face.</p><p>\u201cThis mess looks to be complicated and the cops are in up to their elbows. I need you to go down there and untangle it.\u201d</p><p>Finally. Something I could actually sink my teeth into.</p><p>I held the phone between my shoulder and my ear and took a pencil and a notepad off the nightstand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen-twelve Griffin.\u201d</p><p>Griffin Street ran through SoNo, one of the former financial districts, sandwiched between Midtown and Downtown. The name came from \u201cSouth of North Avenue.\u201d It was a bad, unstable area, with old office buildings crashing down left and right.</p><p>\u201cWhat were the shapeshifters doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking,\u201d Jim said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reclamation site.\u201d</p><p>Reclamations. Oh no. No. He wouldn\u2019t do that to me. I kept my voice even. \u201cWho was in charge of the site?\u201d</p><p>Please don\u2019t be Raphael, please don\u2019t be Raphael, please don\u2019t ...</p><p>\u201cMedrano Reclamations,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>\u201cRaphael is being questioned by some cops, but I\u2019ve sent some lawyers down to make sure they don\u2019t keep him. He\u2019ll join you as soon as they spring him out of there. Look, I know things aren\u2019t good between you and Raphael, but we all have to do things we don\u2019t want to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cJim,\u201d I cut him off. \u201cI\u2019ve got it.
